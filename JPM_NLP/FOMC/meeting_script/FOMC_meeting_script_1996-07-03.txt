CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would like  to welcome Governors  Rivlinand Meyer to  their  first  exposure to  this Committee.  I also wouldlike to  welcome  Helen Holcomb, who  is  First Vice  President  of  theDallas Bank, to  her first  meeting.  I hesitate  to welcome,  but  I haveno choice after we  approve the minutes, our  friend over  there.  Wouldsomeone  like to move  the minutes?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  So  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Peter, I wasreferring  to  you a moment  ago.  [Laughter]  You are on.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I will  be referring  to  the package of  chartsthat was  just  distributed.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  These are very interesting  charts.  I ama little puzzled by  the implicit  theoretical  construction  in thecharts  showing  the  relationship between implied volatilities  oncurrency options  and exchange rates.  I would not  have  a problem ifyou were endeavoring  to  evaluate a market price  for  stocks,  bonds,tomatoes,  or whatever in which  there is  only a net long position.  Butexchange rates  are not  of  that nature,  of  course,  and what  appears  tobe  a theoretical basis  for arguing that  low volatility is  a harbingerof  a weak dollar--or whatever you were saying!--is  it  a sharply risingvolatility  that you were  saying is  a harbinger of  a weaker dollar?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  A change  in  the dollar.  I tried to  be  careful.If  you look  at  those two charts,  they  tend to  suggest a random walk inthe  relationship between  increased volatility and the  direction  thedollar will  go, but  in the  last  few years the direction has beentoward a weaker  dollar.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  I have  to  say has nothing  to dowith your  statement!  [Laughter]  I am a little puzzled in the  sensethat whatever the  theoretical  construction there  is  for  the  dollar,  ithas to  be  exactly the  opposite for  the  deutsche mark.  I am  curious asto  how you explain  the  fact  that you are getting this  type ofrelationship in  one  currency and not  the reverse  in the  other.  Are welooking at  really random events  or  is  there  a theoretical  conceptionthat you can impose  on  these  data to  explain why you don't  getopposite  effects  for  the dollar versus  the  mark.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  I am not going  to be able  to  answer  thatat  the  theoretical  level  for  the  long  sweep of history.  The  data showthat  it  is  in the  last  couple  of years  that  the  market has had a biasin  favor  of  the mark;  when volatility pops,  it  is  the dollar  thatweakens.  The point  is  that  it  ought  to be a random walk as  to whichway  the  exchange rate  goes  when volatility goes  up, and I think thatis  probably the  case  in  the  long  sweep of history.  The phenomena thatI am looking at  and I am concerned about  are not  a theoretical  orprincipled articulation of  the relationship between  options and spotprices,  but  they relate to what  I have  observed and heard in  talkingto dealers,  namely, that people are writing  a very large number  of7/2-3/96options  right now.  So,  I am offering you statistical  data points  inthe chart  that  reflect  what we hear  in  the market  about all  theoptions  that  are being written.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Theoretically, in exchange transactionsall  technical  factors  should be  neutral.  To  the  extent  they are notneutral, then we have  only net  long positions  in some particularsecurity, or  claim, or  something  of  that nature.  I am really puzzledthat we  can construct  something  like  this.  I don't  deny therelationship, but  it  is  not  outside  the realm of  a random walk.Clearly, we  get noise  in any  series,  and I am just  curious  whether ornot you have  come upon something  that has  little more  than curiosityvalue versus  something  that may explain certain  fundamentals about  the

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think I have both a degree of  curiosity and,given the  history of  the  last  few years, a point  of  concern about  thelevel  of  options being written.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You should  think about  that.  This  is  aninteresting set  of  relationships, but I am not  sure what to  make ofit.  As  I said, I am curious.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I share your concern.  I am a little worriedabout what  we may be seeing.  I had thought about  this a littledifferently.  It  would seem that  this  autumn is  going to be  aninteresting period, particularly among European  currencies.  What  ismotivating banks  to write  options,  to bet  on continuing low volatilityin  the  exchange market when, just  reading the papers,  we  are  told thatvolatility is  going to be  increasing?  It  seems  to me  that  there is  alot more  risk out  there  than usual.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  incentive  that  is most  evident  to me  is  thatthey can't make money  through normal  channels.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  They can't make money the  old-fashioned way!

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  They now are subject  to  a rather disciplinedapproach to  income  targets that  are  set  in terms  of  the level  ofincome  they are supposed to  achieve month by month.  I am not sayingthat  is  a pretty sight.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  So, we  are back  in the  incentive-structureproblem?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think in  the  short  run, yes,  that  is  a bigpart of  it.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It  is  not  the  first  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Peter, I have  a question about  your domesticoperations.  When I see  something like  a 50 percent  fed  funds rate,  itcatches my attention.  In your  comments you made  some  reference  to  theinefficiencies and  anomalies  in the  distribution of  reserves yesterdayand again today that  initially  led banks to  think that  the market  forreserves was  tighter than was  actually the  case.  What all  that  says7/2-3/96-3-to me  is  that  there  is  an  inefficiency  in  the market due  to  thequality of  the  information.  Some  of  that  information we have.  It  isan  infinite  regression sort of  thing.  We  are  trying  to  guess  at  whatbankers' behavior is  going  to be  over  the maintenance period.  Theirstrategy is  to  run reserve deficiencies until  the  14th  day of  theperiod and then  look to  us on  settlement  day as  the reserve  supplierof  last  resort.  We and they guess at what  the  total  supply ofreserves  is  in  the market  and its  distribution, and  on  the  last  day ofthe  period they come  in  to  borrow from  the  Federal Reserve.  Can't weimprove on  that  somewhat  either  in  the quality of  the  information wegive  them or  the way we  operate to  smooth out  the  availability ofreserves  over the maintenance period?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Let me  try  to  take  the  second leg  of  that  first.The  skewing of  the demand  for reserves  toward the end  of  themaintenance period is  a normal pattern but  one that we have  seenbecome more pronounced in  the  past  year.  My initial  reaction to  thatwas  to  try to  force  banks to  smooth  their demand for  reserves,  forcethem to  come  to me  in  a smoother way over the course of  the period.That,  though, has  the negative  feedback  consequence of making  thefunds  rate very soft  early in  the period.  We just  can't  fight  it.They want  the reserves when  they want  them and pushing too  hard tocounter  that  does not  work.  So,  in  the  current  environment  I have notfound  it  a fruitful  course to  try to  insist that  they  take reserveswhen I want  to  give  them.With regard to  the  information available  to  the market,  Ithink  there may be  some steps we  could  take.  I am  somewhatuncomfortable with the  continued use  of  the  customer RP, which is  abit  of  an historical artifact.  It used to  reflect  the pass-through  ofthe  repo pool  when the  repo pool  was  only  $2 or  $3 billion or  somesimilarly  small  amount.  Now the  repo pool  is  $10  billion or  more, andwe  really do not pass  it  through to  the market  in any sense.  Thecustomer  RP also  was used by my predecessors  as  the non-signalingdevice, which likewise  is  no  longer necessary, but it  does have  thetradition  of having  the  amount  to  be  done publicly attached to  it.One thought  I have, which I intend  to propose when I come  back  to youwith  an outline  of  the  steps we have  to  go  through to  conduct ouroperations earlier  in the  day, would be  to  ask for  your guidance on  mydesire  to  eliminate  the  use of  the  customer RP  as  we now employ it.We would do  only System Account  RPs.  Currently when we do  a customerRP, we  announce that we might  do,  say,  a total  of up  to  $1.5  billion;however, if  we  tell  the market  that we  are doing  RPs  for  SystemAccount  we never announce  how much we are  doing.I think a big  step in  the right  direction would be to  limitour  operations to  System repos and when we  finish our review of  thepropositions we have received in  a given operation we  could thenannounce  to  the market how much was  done--whether it was  $4.5 billionor whatever  the amount.  Interestingly, that would not  have helped usall  that much yesterday when we had a very anomalous  day.  There weremore  reserves  than we  thought,  and we would have led the  market astrayin  thinking there were  fewer reserves.  So,  that would not havehelped.  A combination of  things  occurred yesterday.  One major bankmaking payments  on corporate securities  delayed  the payments untilvery late  in  the day, so  recipients of very routine dividends  did notthink  they were  coming.  Another bank experienced a shortage early  inthe  day but ended  the  day with much more  funds  than they  had7/2-3/96-4-anticipated.  All  of  that money became  available  toward the  end of  theday, and the  federal  funds  rate  fell  sharply late  in  the  day.  So,  ourprovision of  a little  more information yesterday might have misled  theintend to come  back  to  the  Committee--perhaps at  the August  ormore  information to  the public.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Will what you  come back with address  thefundamental issue  of  the current  reserve  settlement  structure, whichas  I recall  was  set  up in  the  early 1980s  to  improve  the control ofMl?  That was  the motivation, which is  no  longer relevant,  for  settingup this  kind of  settlement procedure.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We do  have some  folks  looking  at what you arereferring  to--the notion of  contemporaneous reserve  accounting versuslagged reserve  accounting.  There would be  transition costs  to  goingback to  lagged accounting and the  issue  is whether  those  costs wouldbe outweighed by the benefits  of  reduced reserve requirementuncertainties.  We have  staff  both at  the Board and at  the New YorkBank looking  at how we could simplify things.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I would like  to  state a hypothesisand then  ask Peter how he would evaluate  it,  since he  is  closer  to  theforeign  exchange market  these  days  than I am.  It  seems  to me that  oneof  the  reasons  that people are writing a lot of  options--because thatis  where profitability is  available--is  driven by developments  in  theforeign exchange market.  The major players  now have such  aninvestment  in people and systems  that  they have very heavy fixedcosts.  For  example, part  of  the  remuneration that  they had deemed  tobe variable in  the past, namely the bonuses,  are now becoming more  andmore  sticky.  We have major foreign banks,  mainly in  the New Yorkfixed-period contracts  with assured bonuses.  So,  the bonus becomes afixed cost  for  two  or  three years.  When  they are  in  that  kind ofsituation, unless  they are willing to  absorb  operating  losses,  theyhave  to  scramble  and look  for whatever profit opportunities  seem to beavailable.  That  means  that  they would have a tendency to develop verylarge positions, whether it  is  in derivatives  or  the  cash market.  Soif  there  is  an unexpected move  in the market,  the  likelihood of peoplescrambling to cover  their positions  can  lead to  greater volatility.Does  that make  sense  to  you, Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  I think  it  does, particularly in  theforeign exchange market.  The  early to mid-'90s was  a period whenthese  firms  were building up  capacity.  The great  successes in  incometerms  in  '92,  '93  and  '94  for many dealing rooms  led them to build uptheir  capacity and their fixed costs  just  as you described, and Ithink they are all  feeling some pain now and, perhaps regrettably,that is  driving the  expansion in  their position-taking.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  How would the implied volatilities andthe historical volatilities move with respect  to  the magnitude ofexchange rate movements?7/2-3/96

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  exchange  rate movements  follow changes  inhistorical  volatility but with a  lag.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What is  the  order  of  magnitude?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I am sorry I can't calculate  that  off  the  top  ofmy head.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  One  of  the  issues  that  raises  is  that,if  you have  a structural problem in  the  supply  and demand  for options,it  would tend to  reflect  itself  in  an  inefficient options  market whichin  turn would tend  to  reflect  a pattern  that  differs  from  the actualvolatility in  the  exchange market.  One way of  testing this  hypothesisis  to  look  at how these  option volatilities relate  to  actualhistorical  volatility, and  that would give  us  at  least  some  sense  asto  the  structural  change  in the  system.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  let  me  try this  on you.  I hope  this  ishelpful.  I talked with one person at  a  firm  in  this market  for whom Ihave a great  deal  of respect,  and he  referred to  the  current  level  ofoptions  as  both too high and  too  low.  Implied volatility was  too highbecause  it was  still  considerably above  the recent  historicalexperience.  It  was  too  low for his  taste  because he didn't  think hewas going  to  get compensated for  the  risks  he would be taking  at  thecurrent  levels.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't  know what  I am  learning, but  Iam learning  something!

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I  think the  hypothesis  checks  out,but we  can go back and do  some work  on  that.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  we will  go back and work on  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Peter,  I just wanted to  ask what  the  source  ofthese  options  data was  that you use  for your calculations  and charts.MR. KOS.  A  couple of  investment  firms  gave  us  the data.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The back data  were provided by a couple  ofinvestment banks.  We  have been collecting more recent  data routinelyoff the  screens  ourselves.MR. KOS.  These  are  fresh 1-month and  12-month  impliedvolatilities  on  OTC  options  that  are  collected every day;  the data arenot  obtained  from the  exchanges.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  So,  they are basically over-the-counter.  Doyou think  they  are  comparable going back as  far  as  you  do?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  They are  the best data  we have been able  to get.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Well,  okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions?  Would somebodylike  to move  approval  of  Peter's  domestic  operations?7/2-3/96-6-

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I move approval.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?)  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  We now move  on tothe  Chart  Show presented by Messrs.  Prell  and Truman.

[SECTION]

MESSRS.  PRELL and TRUMAN.  [Statements--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Going back  to your analysis  of world oilincreasing but  at  a slower pace.  Are  these  statistics millions ofbarrels per day?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They are  changes  in production  in barrels perday.  Production  is  expected to peak  in  1997  and to  turn  down afterthat.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I gather that  the Norwegian expansionhas  been accelerating very  recently.  Is  that going to  peter out?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  as  you probably know better  than I, everytime we  have looked  at North Sea production over  the  last  10  years,  itwas  going to  diminish in  2 years.  The people who  look at  this,  andthey  include the  experts  of  the  International  Energy Agency, expectthat Norwegian production will  level  off at  a peak level  in  1997  andthen decline.  That  is,  of  course,  one  of  the  reasons  why we don't  getthe  same non-OPEC  supply coming on stream as  in recent  years.  That  isthe  logic.  New discoveries  and new techniques  obviously could lead  tomore production than we now assume, but  that  remains  to be  seen.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  table  implies  that  we will  reachoil  inventory equilibrium at  the  end of  this year.  Is  that going tohappen considering  the  extreme  shortfalls that we have experienced?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  one  issue  has  to  do  with the question ofIraqi  production coming on  stream.  In fact,  we had assumed  in ourforecast  that  the  800  thousand barrels per day from  Iraq  in  the  secondhalf  of  the year would be  enough  to plug the  hole  in  stockbuildingthat was  created over  the  first half  of  the  year.  If  that were not  tohappen,  if  the  oil  flow from Iraq were to  start  on  January 1 insteadof August  16,  we would have  oil  prices  staying up above  the  $17  perbarrel  range  through the  fourth quarter  and then  coming down to  the$17  per barrel  range over  the  first part of  next year.  So,  theinventory plug results  in some  sense  from the  supply  coming from  Iraq.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And the  assumption is  that  there will beno  endeavor by other producers  as  a group to  pull back on  their oilproduction?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes.  In  fact,  we probably will  have a littlemore  cheating.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike, when I compare  the  current  forecast to  thewide  measures.  I guess an  exception  is  the CPI  in  1996.  Yet, as  I7/2-3/96read  the Greenbook, and the  same  impression came  through  in yourpresentation today, you seem to  have shifted your assessment  of therisks  significantly to  the  up  side.  What  is your  rationale  forshifting  the  risks without having an impact  on  the expected values  inthe  forecast?  In  fact,  I think I have asked this  question about  risksmany times  in  the past,  and as  I recall  I have gotten only one  answer,namely, that  the  risks were  symmetric.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  there have been some  occasions when wehave indicated  that  the risks  in our  outlook were  asymmetric.  I wouldcharacterize  our  forecasts over  the years  as  an effort  to  present ameaningful,  modal  forecast  of  the most  likely  outcome.  When we  feltthat  there was  some  skewness  to  the probability distribution, we triedto  identify it.  In  this  instance,  as  we  looked at  the recent  data, wefelt that  there  was  a greater  thickness  in  the  area  of  our probabilitydistribution a little  above  our modal  forecast, particularly for  thenear term,  than  there was  on  the other  side  of  our  forecast.  I amvery conscious  of  the  fact  that  we have made  some  of our biggestmistakes  in  the past by losing sight  of  the trends  in  responding tothe run  of  recent data, and that  is  part  of  the  reason why I tried  tofocus  some  attention  on the  GDP pattern  on a moving-average basis.  Wehave been  getting very erratic movements  in GDP data  over  the pastyear or  two,  and we may well be  seeing another episode of  that  kind.I don't  feel uncomfortable  at  all  in  saying that we  think the  highestprobability is  that we  are going to  experience some  significantslackening of the  expansion in  the  near  term.  We  can point  to  somespecial  factors  that have  lifted growth  in  the most  recent quarter.Some  of  these affected just  the  second quarter  and they were  offsetsto  developments  in  the  first  quarter.  Some may have lifted activityabove what  the  second-quarter level  would have been  in the  absence  ofvarious  shocks,  thus  raising  the first-half  growth rate.  On balance,we think there  is  a good case  for  the  slowing scenario, but we  alsocan  see  an  alternative  scenario with somewhat  faster growth in  thenear term  than we  have projected.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Ted, in  Chart  10,  you have given us  a niftytool  of  analysis.  I had a question  about  one of  your assumptions.The policy  assumption  in the  chart  is  that  U.S. and  foreign monetaryauthorities  target nominal  GDP.  To my knowledge  the  nominal GDPdevelopments  in  the  developing countries,  including much of  East Asiaand Latin America, have not  had a big  effect  on  our decisions.  Wouldthere be  a need to  relax that  assumption with regard to  developingcountries?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well, you have uncovered a sleight  of  hand.Actually,  the  formal  assumption  that we make  for  the  developingcountries  in the  model  simulations  is  that  their  interest  rates  followour interest  rates.  So,  if  we  damp our nominal GDP  or lean against  asurge in  nominal  GDP by raising  our interest  rates,  their rates  go up,too.  Actually, when we ran  this  simulation, that  proved to  beinsufficient,  for perhaps  obvious  reasons.  We  therefore went  in andconstrained the GDP growth path  for  those  countries.  That  took  outsome  of  the shock,  if  you want  to  put  it  that way, so  that growth inthe  developing countries  did not continue  on a higher path.7/2-3/96

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But your  added constraint  certainly  isn't  --

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We got  that  result without  specifying the policymechanism by which nominal GDP  is held down for  those countries, butin  terms of  trying to  control  the  impetus  to  the  U.S. economy, we haveachieved that modest  result.  In fact,  when we did  it  another way, wecame up with  a huge  expansion in the  developing countries  because therise  in U.S.  interest  rates was  insufficient  to  set  off  a timelymultiplier-accelerator process  in reverse.  We  therefore went  in andessentially damped things  down so  that we  got  something close  to  thesame  growth path  from  the  developing countries as  we did with thedeveloped countries where  the  real  level  of  economic activity risesthrough  the  first  two  years,  then essentially  levels off,  andsubsequently comes  down a bit  as  the  interest rate  effects  take hold.We  have  essentially  the  same  income path  in both cases  for  the  U.S.economy.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Why wouldn't an exchange  rate peg work in thatmodel?  It  would be  a somewhat  more  relaxed assumption  than  the  oneyou made, but  less  relaxed than  in  an unconstrained model.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes, but  the model  runs  off  interest rates  andthe  exchange rates  of  the  developing countries  do stay pretty much inline with the  dollar.  That  is  one of  the  reasons,  in  fact, why wehave a different  exchange rate  in  the  two  scenarios.  In  the firstcase  interest rates  go up more  in the  industrial  countries  than  theydo  in  the  United States  and as  they go  up  that pulls up  theircurrencies.  In  the  second case, we don't  have  that  effect,  so  that'swhy the dollar goes  the other way than  it does  in  relation to  thecurrencies of  the  industrial  countries, because we  share  in  some  sensethe  same  income growth  factors.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I would  like  to  refer to  Chart 14relating to  the  labor markets.  On labor productivity, which  obviouslyis  a key consideration for  the  forecast,  I think the most  recenteconomic data have productivity trailing off even more  than  this  trendline would indicate.  Indeed, you have productivity  improvement  in1997  at  1 percent  in the  forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Roughly.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Is  that  something that you areconcerned about  in  terms  of  the possibility that  it might be on thehigh side  or  is  that  something  that, within  the  confidence  factors  forestimating productivity, you are  feeling rather  confident  about?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I would say that  is  one of  the  things  that wefeel  the  least discomfort about.  We  are  forecasting  fairly steady,moderate growth  in productivity.  We  don't start  off with  any majordisequilibria that we  can see in  terms of  employers having hired wellbeyond production levels.  A  trend increase  in productivity seemsentirely reasonable  in  these circumstances.  I think the  question iswhether the  trend from here will be  what it  has been over  an  extendedperiod.  As  I said,  the  trend has  been pretty steady since  1973,  andobviously we have discussed many times  around this  table whetherrecent higher  levels  of  investment  or  changes in  technology and so  on7/2-3/96might bring  about  some acceleration in productivity growth.  We havenot  seen  it  yet;  the most  recent figures  don't  indicate  it.  So,  weare  staying pretty much with  a fairly  straightforward extrapolation  ofrecent  trends.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mr. Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Mike,  I want  to  ask a question to  get yourresponse  from the  standpoint  of the  forecast,  but  I also want  to  getPeter Fisher's  response  from  the  standpoint of how  the market wouldreact.  You made  reference to  slight  declines  in  longer-term  interestrates;  you used the  10-year rate  in  the  chart.  As  I think about yourforecast  for  the  next  six months,  I ask myself what  is  going  to  happenafter real  GDP decelerates  from an  indicated growth rate  of  around 4percent  in  the second  quarter  to rates  in  your forecast  of  2.3  and 1.9percent  in the  third and fourth quarters;  the monthly  average  for  theCPI  is  an  increase of  .2 percent  for  the remaining seven months  of  theyear;  housing starts  drop  from  the  1.46  - 1.47  million area;  motorvehicle  sales  and production drop  from a rate  of  over  15  million unitsto  something below that;  and job growth slows  to  increases  of  only100,000 a month  in  the  final  three months  of  the year.  I wonder whatthe  reaction  is  going  to be  in  the bond market,  if  that  pattern  ofeconomic  statistics  is  seen as  unfolding.  Is  that  consistent withonly  a slight  decline  in bond yields?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  That  is  a quite reasonable  question,  and Icertainly would not  see  it  as  implausible  to  have  the bond marketrallying beyond our  assumption  for  some period of  time.  In my view,the  only thing  that would tend  to  limit  such a rally in  terms of  howfar  down yields might  go permanently is  that we don't have aparticularly  steep yield curve at  this point.  And if  one hypothesizedthat a few months  down  the  road the  economy is  perceived to  be  on astable,  sustainable,  and moderate growth course with  inflation perhapscreeping up,  I would not expect--with  the assumed 5-1/4  percentfederal  funds  rate--to see  the  bond yield go  a lot  lower  than weanticipate.  Basically, we have  the  long bond moving  down  to  a rangeof  somewhere around  6-3/4 percent.  It would not be  surprising that  arun  of  softer data would  induce a bond rally that would bring theyield noticeably below that  level.  How far  down  the yield on  the longbond would be  expected to  go  an ongoing basis,  I think, is  thequestion.  Clearly, there  are  some  in  the market who  are talking  about6 percent bond yields  and in  terms  of  the variability we have beenseeing in  the market--the overshooting--that level  is  well withinreach on  a run of  appealing data.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I can't  improve on  that;  I agree with Mike.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Mike, we  recently had an  auto  industry consultantdrop by the  Bank.  He had a couple of  things  to  say that  I, at  least,found interesting and  I want  to  get  your reaction  to  it.  First,  hewas quite  sanguine  about  the  outlook for  light motor vehicle salesextending  over a number  of years;  basically, he  saw them continuing torun at  15  million units  or  so at  an annual  rate.  It  was  largely areplacement story  that  he was  telling.  Having provided us with  that,he  also  talked about what  he perceives  to  be  a great deal  of  excessproductive  capacity worldwide.  Even  allowing  for  further sales  growth7/2-3/96in  Latin America and parts  of  Asia, his  view is  that  there  is  a lot  ofexcess capacity around.  I wondered if  that was  in  fact  right, becausethat would have  some  implications  for  the  labor negotiations  comingalong  later  this year.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't  know how much useful  excess  capacity isleft  in  the United States.  I suspect  that  when we  tote  the numbers upit  looks  as  if  there  is  a lot,  but when we  look at  current  productionproblems, we  see  that,  for  those categories  of  cars  and trucks  thatpeople want  to buy,  the manufacturers  would like  to build more  thanthey currently can.  It  isn't  simply a matter  of  assembly capacity.In many cases  the  capacity limits  are  in  the production of  some  keycomponents  -- engines  and so  on.  So,  effectively there may not be  alot of  slack in  this  country.  I suspect  there  is  some  considerableslack  in  Japan at  this  point and maybe elsewhere.  When we  talk aboutyearly sales  of  15  million units or  a little more on an  ongoing basis,I guess  I can't quarrel with  that  too  much.  I think  the  foremostauthority in the  room on replacement  demand is  the  Chairman.  He hasdone  some  research on  this  subject  in  the  last  few years.  Looking atthe results  of  that  analysis,  15  million would seem to  be a littlehigh.  But  if  you  talk about  an economy in  which incomes  are risingand people  have a taste  for  having more motor vehicles per household-- maybe everyone wants  to have  a sport utility  car,  a family  sedan,and who  knows what  else  -- perhaps  there  is  a potential  for higherongoing demand.  I think  the automobile manufacturers  are  looking atforecasts based on  trends  that  are  a little higher than  we have  in  ourforecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Just  a quick couple of  questions,  Mike.  In  theadjustments  on the  CPI  that  are more  or  less  technical  adjustments,have you gone back and redone  the CPI  over time,  or perhaps  back acouple  of years,  to  see if  we  still have the  same  trend that we  sawbefore?  The  striking thing  about  this  Greenbook is  that,  because ofthose  technical adjustments, we  see  inflation  flattening  out  fromwhere we  think it  has been.  But  it  really has  not been there becausethe numbers  that we were using before did not  have  those  technicaladjustments  in them.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  I will yield to  my colleague,  who is  muchmore expert  on this,  but there  is,  in  a sense,  a discontinuity here.Some of  the  adjustments we  are making have  to  do with the  arithmeticthat perhaps  you can view as  fairly predictable.  When it  gets  tothings  like changing  the way in which costs  of  medical care  arecalculated, there  are  real  underlying economic  considerations  involvedand the  relationships could  shift.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  They may not be  the  same.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We have  tried to  make a sensible assessment  ofhow movements  in the  old and new versions would go and that  is  whatled us  to make  the  adjustments  that we  did, but  I think that  all  thisis  a little problematic.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Maybe very minor.7/2-3/96-11-

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  President Minehan, we have  a long history ofadjustments  to  the  CPI;  it goes  back over  the  entire postwar period.Improvements  are  continually  being made, but  I believe  there will be  aconcentration of  them  in  this  1996,  1997,  and  1998  period.  In  fact,we  could see  some discontinuities  stemming from  the  improvements inmethodology as well  as  changes  in medical  care  estimates.  In 1998,another significant  change could be an updating of  the  weightingscheme  that  could  take another  couple of  tenths  off  the  core  CPI.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You also  have  to  look  back historicallyand ask yourself what was  actually going  on.  If  we combine  all  theadjustments  and go back in  time,  it  does  show a different  picture.  Wehave  been looking at  a picture  in which  core CPI  appears  to  haveflattened  out.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Maybe  it  really has  been declining.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The mere change of  the  dubious  medicalprice  component  in  the  CPI  for  the much better medical net  outputprice  in  the  PPI  plus  a change  in  the weights  in  and of  itself  takeswhat was  a flat  trend  and turns  it  down.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  The Greenbook projects  the  core CPI  to  declineand then to  come back up again.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well,  it has  not  come back up  if  youlook  through the month of May.  That's  the whole point.  In  otherwords,  the backup  is  a forecast.  I will  try to  document this  at  somelength tomorrow.  It  is  a very relevant  issue  and it  is very  importantfor  us  to  answer the  question of  what  in  fact  the  inflation  rate hasbeen.  The problem that we  are running  into here  is  that we  arecombining changing  inflation with changing BLS procedures.  I thinkthat  is  creating a degree of  skewness  that we have  to  cut  through.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  For me  the  question is  not  even what  inflationis  in absolute  terms.  It  is  what  the  trend is  and that  is  hard tounderstand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'll  try  to  explain  it  tomorrow on  thebasis  of  the  data we have put  together.  If  we  look  at  various  broadmeasures  of  inflation  including the core  PCE chain price  index, whichis  the best  consumer price  index by  far as  Roberts pointed out  in  hismemo, it  really makes  a difference.  Even looking at  broader measuressuch as  the  gross  domestic purchases  chain price  index, which picks upconsumer prices plus  everything else,  that  index has  been goingstraight  down into  the  current quarter with no  evidence yet of  a turn.Our view of  what  is happening  to  inflation is  a critical  issue herebecause it  says  a great deal  about what  is  going  on  in the  economy.It  is very difficult  to  forecast  the  outlook for  economic activityunless we have some  sense  of  that pattern.  The  emphasis that we havebeen putting on  the  consumer price  index,  I think in  retrospect,  isturning out  to have been a mistake.  It  has been a mistake  in  thesense  that  the CPI  is  biased not  only with respect  to  the  absoluteamount of  change--the  1/2  to  1-1/2  percentage point bias--but  there  isalso  increasing evidence  that  the bias  is  increasing.  That  suggeststhat  the true measures  of  inflation  are  giving us  a somewhat  differentpicture,  one  that  in  a certain sense  is  ambiguous but,  to  the  extent7/2-3/96-12-that  we can  observe,  one  that  indicates  a slower rate  of  inflation.Now, that may be noise but that  is  the  interpretation.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I have oneother small  question.  Ted, on  your Chart 7, Foreign Growth  and U.S.Exports,  is  that merchandise exports  alone  or merchandise andservices?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  top chart?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes,  or  any  of  those charts.  Do  they  includeservices as  well?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  No,  the  top  chart in  the  top panel  includes  justgoods.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Are  the rest  of  these  just goods,  too?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  These are  all  goods  in nominal  terms.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It  doesn't  show on  the charts  on the next pageor  at  least  it  doesn't  show  clearly as  I understand this,  but exportsof  services are  growing more  than  exports of  merchandise, are  theynot?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  My memory would be  that,  for example  this  year,we have  exports  of  merchandise growing  7 percent  and exports  of  goodsand services  together growing  5 percent.  Next year  it  is  11  and 9percent.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So  you have services pulling the overall  rateof  growth down?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes,  services  are  pulling it  down.  Last yearservices  in  the  GDP accounts grew only 1-1/2 percent  over  the  fourquarters.  I hesitate to  offer a firm opinion because  this  calculationto  incorporate  them in  the  historical  GDP numbers.  Whether  therevisions  got  incorporated in  the  right way, I am not  100  percentconfident.  There was some  double  counting of  services.  I think thathappened more  on the  import side  than on the  export  side.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Is  there  any reason  to  assume  that  the growthof  services  in  foreign  trade  is  being skewed by the  relativeperformance  of  trade with developing countries versus  industrialcountries?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Because you come  from New England, you probablythink that your region  is  providing a lot  of  services.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That don't get measured, yes.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That don't  get measured in.  I have  the  samebias,  but  I have not been able  to  convince anybody  that  the  treatmentis  wrong.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  We  believe  that, but maybe  like  a lot  of  theother things we believe,  it  isn't  true.7/2-3/96-13-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mike,  I have  a question on  the  housing  sector.We are  seeing  some quite good  increases  in  the  average price of  housesin our  area and  some  buying  in the  expectation  of  further  increases.That may help  to explain  the  run-up in mortgage  rates.  What  do  thedata  show more generally  about  housing prices?  Are you  seeing any ofthat  in  the data  for  the nation  or  is  that  just a  local phenomenon?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  If we  look at  the  constant quality or  repeatsales prices,  there has been  some pickup  in house  price inflation  overthe past year or  so.  This  is  uneven across  the  country.  Yourregional  market  may be experiencing some pressures  that we wouldn'tfind elsewhere.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Do you  see it  in  terms  of  anticipatory buyingmore  generally?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I don't recall  that  that  stood  out  in  any majorway in  the Michigan  Survey, for  example,  where people are  able  to  citethat kind of  factor as  a reason why they think  this  is  a good  time  tobuy a home.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mike, at  the  top  of  Chart  14  there  is  a red  linelabeled productivity trend.  "Trend" tells  us  about slope  and growthrate,  but is  there  a level  connotation here as  well?  Is  that  similarto what we would get  if  we were  asking  what  the  level  of  output  isrelative  to potential?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We would take  this  as  a reasonable representationof  where  productivity is  relative to  the  trend and  say  that  we arepretty close  to  trend growth,  thus  arguing against  a big pickup  or

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Do you measure  separately an  actual potentialoutput  gap as  opposed to  a labor market utilization  gap?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We do have  corresponding numbers.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  And is  it  just  an Okun's  Law transformation or  isit  done  separately?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  It's not  just  an Okun's  Law transformation.It  is  a little  more  complicated  in  the way  it  is  estimated.  But it  isconceptually quite  similar.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  And what would it be  showing  right now?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  It  would show a  slight  excess  demand at  thispoint.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes,  we are  talking  just several  tenths  of  apercent, very much  in  line with our NAIRU.7/2-3/96-14-

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  You mentioned that  you are  discounting recentincreases  in  average hourly earnings and,  I take  it,  in the  employmentcost  index measure  of wage  gains.  Why?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  For average hourly earnings,  the  charts  that  welook at  are  dramatic  if we  take  the  latest observation  and think aboutit  in  terms  of  the  12-month change.  We  recognize  that  there was  anodd reading  a year earlier that  will drop  out when we get  the nextreading, and we would not be  surprised to  see  the  12-month  change movefrom 3.4 percent  in  the latest  month back  toward 3 percent.  Thatwould  still be  above the  lows we  saw a couple of  years ago  and itgives  us  a sense  of  an upward movement, but it  would be more  the kindof  creeping movement that  we would have anticipated, given pricebehavior and what we perceive  to be  the moderate  size of  the  gapbetween unemployment  and the NAIRU over  this  period.  On the  ECI,looking at  the composition,  looking at  what happened in terms  of  salesworkers  and  some  of  the unevenness  in  those figures,  we  think itlikely that we  are going  to see  some  considerable  slackening in  therate  of  increase  in  this  wage measure  in  the  second quarter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mike,  did you get  a confirmation on thechain-weighted average  hourly earnings  calculation?  Has  it  come  in?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I was  told that we would be  trying to get  that,but  I have not  heard anything.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think you ought  to point  out  that  theBLS  does calculate  a chain-weighted average hourly earnings  index  thatendeavors  to  take out  the inter-industry effects  of approximately 300to 400  industries.  Unless  that  calculation is  done  inappropriately,it  shows  an  actual  diminution  instead of  an  acceleration over the  last12  months  on  a year-over-year basis.  That implies  that  there hasbeen, if  these calculations  are  correct, a significant  shift  in thecomposition toward higher-paid production worker  industries--notoccupations but  industries--and  this  raises  some  interesting  issuesabout  what the  trend  in  the  raw average  hourly earnings  data showsover and above  the year-over-year question in  the May data.  I assumethat we will  get  a test  on  Friday as  to  whether that hypothesis  iscorrect.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  What we are  anticipating might yield aconsiderable narrowing of  the  gap between the recent  levels  of thosetwo measures.  I guess  I would characterize  that chain-weightedmeasure as  having moved pretty much in  a sideways  channel over  thelast year as  opposed to  an upward sloping channel.  I still  think theregular average  hourly earnings  series and the  compensation per hourdata from productivity and costs,  which don't have  fixed weights,  canalso yield some  useful  information about what  is  going on within thelabor  market that  is  relevant to  thinking about  pressures  on prices.That  is,  a markup might be applied to  this kind  of  compensationmeasure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Doesn't  that  depend on  the  relationshipbetween  individual wages  and individual productivity?  The  reason isthat  if  there  is  a fixed relationship between any individual wage  andthe  productivity level,  then a change  in wages will be associated witha comparable  shift  in productivity, and unit  labor  costs will beinvariant  to  that shift.  So, you really have  to  stipulate that  the7/2-3/96-15-relationship between marginal productivity  and wages  is  different bygroups and  I don't  know that  we have  the  evidence  for  that.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Again, we have not  explored  this  in  great depthbut  the  concern might be  that,  in  the  cyclical  experience,  one  seesthese changing weight measures  as  tending to  accelerate, perhaps  as anearly signal  of  the broader pressures  in  the  labor market.  So,  Ithink it's worth looking  at  all  these measures,  and certainly  thatchain-weighted measure  does  suggest  there may be  some complexity  inthis  picture, which  is worth some  investigation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  second-quarter  ECI  will certainlybe  a very interesting piece  of  information.  It  looks  as  though it  iscalculated unambiguously in  an appropriate manner.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  there  are a lot  of  definitional problems,and I suspect  some  firms  that have  to  fill  out  that  form areconfronted with a real  challenge  in  sorting through the  instructions.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I have  a question about the  role  of  the  stockrole  in the  slowdown  scenario in  two ways.  One,  am I correct  that  youhave not passed through the  full wealth effect  of  the  stock marketrise  relative to what  the models would suggest?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  One  can  reach that conclusion.  One has![Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  As  you know,  I have  done  the  same  thing, so  I cansympathize with that.  You  are  leaning a little against  the  wealtheffect relative to  the historical  regularity.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think that's right.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Secondly, on  top  of  that  you have a mild stock

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  How  "mild" is  the mild correction?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  About  5 percent  from where we were  as  of  lastnight.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I would take  it  the source  is  twofold.  To whatextent  does  it  depend on your judgment  that the  current market  ishigh relative to  fundamentals,  and  to what  extent  is  it  driven byexpectations  of  an  earnings  slowdown?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  On the  latter point,  it  is  not  at  all  clear  as welook at  various reports of  analysts'  expectations  that our  profitforecast  is  really lower than  what  is  anticipated in  the market  now.So,  that  leads  me  to characterize  this  expectation as being in essencesome  faith  in gravity.  We have  a feeling that  the market has  beendefying  it  to some  extent recently.  It's not  that  every currentmeasure  of  aggregate valuation is  outside of historical ranges by anymeans.  But when we look  at  some  of  the  internal  aspects  of  the market-- the  IPO craze  and some  of  the other  things  going on  --  and look  at7/2-3/96-16-that against  a backdrop of  some  high valuation measures,  it  suggeststo  us  that  there  is  room for  at  least a moderate downturn.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I think gravity  is  underappreciated in  economicforecasting!

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Usually  it  doesn't work when you expect  it  to,either.  So,  the  fact  is  that  the market,  as  of  last  night,  issignificantly above where we  though it  might be  just  a couple  daysbefore.  In the  last  half year  or so  we have consistently had to  raiseour  stock market  forecast  in  the Greenbook.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions?  If not, whowould like  to start  the  roundtable?  Mr. Broaddus,  go  ahead.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will  try to keepthis  brief  in the  hope  that you might give me  one  or  two  extra minuteswhen we  come  around to  the discussion of  our longer-term policystrategy.  Really one  or  two  minutes  is  all  I want.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Will you  take  seven-eighths?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Let's negotiate!  On balance,  the anecdotalreports  and surveys  that we have been looking  at  for our Districtsuggest a more rapid pace of  expansion  over  the  last  several  weeks.To mention a few  of  the  high spots,  commercial real  estate  activityseems  to  be almost uniformly robust  throughout our region,  and salesof both new and existing housing  also are quite  strong just  abouteverywhere.  There  are  a few pockets  of  resistance,  but for  the mostpart housing  sales  are  strong.  In the  industrial  sector,  we  focus  afair amount  of  attention on  the shipments  index  from our  regularmonthly manufacturing survey.  In May, that  index was at  its  highestlevel  since  last  spring.  With respect  to employment  and labor marketconditions, we have  the  impression  that  labor markets  in  the Districthave  tightened further  recently.  We hear increasing reports  ofrecruitment difficulties not  only  for skilled workers  but  for  lessskilled workers as  well.  That  is  a relatively new development.Finally, we  have  little that  is  new to report  on pricing behavior inthe District except  that  we were  told by one  chemical company in  WestVirginia that  they  finally were able to make  a price  increase stickfor  the  first  time  in  the  last year and a half or  so.On the  national  economy, the June  Greenbook forecast is  notvery much  changed from the May forecast.  It  still  shows real  GDPgrowth dropping back promptly to  trend as  we move  into  the  second halfof  the year.  Although labor costs  as  indexed by the  employment costindex drift  up over  the period, as was  already pointed out  thisafternoon, the basic  inflation  rate  is  reasonably well  contained ataround 3 percent  through the  projection period.  But  even  though thenumbers  in  this  forecast  and those in  the  last  forecast look roughlythe  same,  I would argue that  this is  a much more optimisticprojection.  As  has already been suggested, it  seems  to me  that theupside  risks  in  the projection are considerably more pronounced nowthan  they were at  the  time of  our  last meeting.  The Greenbook itselfseemed to  signal  this  shift at  least  implicitly.  There  is  very littlereference to  downside risk  in  this Greenbook;  there  is  a lot  ofreference  to upside  risk.  For  example,  there  is  a reference to  thesurprising  strength  of  job growth,  housing activity, and consumer7/2-3/96-17-spending.  The point  is  made  that we are  now looking at  the  highestratio of  household net worth  to  disposable income  in  a couple  ofseems  to  be waking up  finally,  and  there is  a comment  on  thepossibility of some  inventory restocking going forward.  For what  itis  worth, our  own Bank's  forecast  is  very close  to  the  Board staffforecast, Mike.  But  the  Bank forecast  is  based on  the assumption thatwe will  tighten policy a notch  at  this meeting.  Without  thistightening, we think that  the  Board's  staff  forecast  is  on theoptimistic  side.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, recent economic  growth hasaccelerated in  California and to  some  extent  in the  remainder of  theDistrict.  Job growth has remained strong in Oregon  and has  picked upfurther  from already high rates  in Nevada, Utah, and Idaho,  leavingthose  four  states  the  fastest  growing in  the nation.  In  severalDistrict states,  job gains  have been tilted toward higher-payingindustries,  and labor markets  are  tight  enough to place  substantialpressures  on wages.  For  example, over the  past 12  months  averagemanufacturing wages have  increased about  6 percent  in Idaho  and  about10 percent  in Nevada.  The  stronger economic  growth  in California  isevident  in a wide variety of  statistics:  The unemployment rate  isfalling, and employment gains,  income  tax withholding, and consumerspending are picking up.  Business  firm  formation and small  businessloan demand also have  taken  off,  and even real  estate values  in  thestate's  long depressed housing market  are moving up,  at  least  in thenorthern part  of  the  state.  Residential  building has not  yetresponded to  this pickup  in profitability, so  looking  ahead we  can seea further boost  to  growth  in California  from its  construction  sector.For  the national  economy, the news  since we met  in May hascaused us  to  revise up our  forecast  for  the  second quarter  and for  theyear as  a whole.  A combination of  stronger-than-expected  demand  inthe  first  and second quarters  and lean  inventories  in  the  firstquarter have  led us to  raise our  forecast  for real  GDP growth in  1996to  2.9  percent  from the  2.3  percent  figure we had in May.  We  expect aslowing  in  the  expansion next year  to  about  1-3/4 percent  as  a resultof  higher interest  rates  and more moderate growth  in  spending stemmingfrom  the accumulation of  larger stocks  of  consumer durables, housing,and plant  and equipment.The  forecast  I have  just  given you  is  even stronger than  itfederal funds  rate by early  1997.  Although  I do  expect  some  slowingin growth next year,  it  would not  be enough  to prevent  the  economyfrom  stretching beyond the  full  utilization  of  its  resources.  As  aconsequence, even with the  tighter policy I have  assumed, I believethat  we face  the  substantial  risk  that underlying inflation,abstracting from oil prices  and the  like, is  set  on  a gradual  upwardtrend.  I find  this prospect  alarming, and  I certainly would like tosee  the inflation rate  trending down.So  as  not to  confuse Mike  Prell,  I would  like  to  note  thatthe Humphrey-Hawkins  forecast  I sent  last week assumed an even higherfederal  funds  rate and showed a lower  real GDP growth  rate for  1997than  the  forecast  I have  just discussed.  I believe  that  such  a policy7/2-3/96-18-would be  an appropriate response  to  the  inflationary threat we arelikely  to  face.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  one you have there  is  not the  oneyou are  forecasting?

MR. PARRY.  That  is  not what  I am  forecasting, right.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like  the Greenbook, weare  close  to  the  consensus  forecast  that  sees  real  GDP growthmoderating  over  the balance  of  1996  and into  1997.  We, too,  see therisks  on  the up  side.Our  forecast  for  auto and light  truck sales  this year andnext  is  quite similar to  that  in the  Greenbook,  and that  forecastimplies some  slowing in  sales  from  the pace we have  seen in  the  firsthalf of  1996.  We have not  seen much slowing yet.  Dealer  ordersremain quite strong.  Reports  from our contacts  indicate that  lightvehicle  sales  in June were  coming in  near the  average pace  of  15.2million units  recorded in  the  first  five months of  this year.  Thefinal  tally will depend on  foreign-nameplate  sales in  the  days  aroundmonth-end.Like  the  auto  industry, other durable goods  producers  in ourDistrict generally have  seen somewhat  stronger-than-expected demandfor  their products  in the  first half  of  the year, and they have  raisedtheir  forecasts  for  the  year to reflect  this.  In most cases,  however,they still  expect  sales to  soften  in  the second half  of  1996.  Forexample, home  appliance shipments  rose to  a record high in April,  arecord  that was broken  in May.  The  industry does not  expect thisstrength to  continue,  however, and revised  forecasts  for  1996  areconsistent with  slower shipments  in the  second half.  Other industriesprojecting weaker  shipments  in  the  second half  include heavy dutytrucks,  construction equipment,  and machine  tools.  We have alreadyseen production  cutbacks  in  heavy-duty trucks.  The story for  steel  isa bit different  because there  is  likely  to  be  some  inventory buildingeven if  demand slackens  in  the  second half.Reports  from District retailers  were mixed but  generallyconsistent with some moderation in  the growth of  consumer spending  indirectors  continue to  express  concern about  increases  in credit carddelinquencies and personal bankruptcies.The  level  of  housing activity is  still  fairly strong  in mostparts  of  the Seventh District, but  we are beginning  to get  reportsthat higher mortgage interest rates  are having  an  impact.  Contrary tothe  national data, permits  in the Midwest  declined more than  starts  inrealtors noted a definite  slowing in  contracts  that were  signed inexisting home  sales  over  the next  few months.  But new home  salescontinue  to be quite  strong in  some parts  of  the  District, withshortages  of  homes  in  the mid-price range being reported.7/2-3/96-19-Labor markets  remain tight  throughout the District.  Theunemployment rate  in  our  states is  still  about  a percentage pointbelow the national  average, but we  continue to have very  few reportsof  mounting wage pressures.  Two weeks ago,  I met with  six chiefexecutive  officers  of  firms and banks based in Wisconsin, where theunemployment  rate  is  now  3.6 percent.  Only one  of  them  expected anacceleration of  wage  increases,  and that was  for  a specialized groupof employees  working on oil  rigs  in Louisiana.  The other  five CEOsexpected wage  and benefit  increases  for their  employees  to be  aboutthe  same  in  1996  as  in  1995.  On  the other hand, we have  had severalrecently signed labor  contracts  for building trade workers  in  Chicagothat  feature wage  increases  averaging 1 to  1-1/2  percent more per yearthan the  contracts  that  they replaced.  As  I mentioned at  the  lastmeeting, wage  increases  in  the steel  industry will be  higher thanthose  in  the  contracts  they are replacing,  and that  is now in bindingarbitration.  There  also  is  a definite trend  to longer-term collectivebargaining agreements, with a number  of  four-year  contracts  replacingthree-year contracts. who  comes  frombelieves  that  this  is  an  indication that workers  are lessconcerned about  inflation now.On  the price  front, most  reports seem  to point  to  littleupward pressure on prices.  Energy prices  in  the District  are  expectedto  continue moderating as  supplies  of  natural  gas accumulate.Competitive  pressures  also  are  keeping District businesses  fromraising prices, particularly in retailing.  However, the  steel priceincrease announced  for July is  expected to  stick, as  there  is  verylittle  excess  capacity in  the  steel  industry and the  order books  arefull  through the  third quarter.  In  agriculture,  corn stocks  obviouslyremain critically low.  Record-high prices have not  generated  the  cutsin usage needed to  stretch  available  supplies  through to  the new cropharvest.  Pressure  on  corn prices probably will not  ease  soonespecially if,  as  seems  increasingly likely, temporary  shortages  occurin  the  summer prior to  harvest.In  summary,  the Seventh District economy continues  to  expand,with the pace  of  growth expected to moderate as we move  into  thesecond half of  the  year.  Price pressures generally seem contained,although some recent  labor  contracts have  included higher wageincreases  than the  agreements  they replaced.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  the  New England economy continuesto  chug along,  though I am  struck by the moderate nature of  the  dataversus some  of  the  heat we  sense in  the  economy from  the anecdotalreports of  our outside  contacts and groups  that visit  the  Bank.  Mycomments will be based both on  the  data  from the  region  and what  wehave been hearing  anecdotally.The pace of  job growth  is  fairly modest  overall  in NewEngland.  The unemployment rate  remains below the national  average.Initial unemployment  claims are  at  low levels,  and labor  force growthrecently has begun to pick up.  Most  of  the  growth  in  employmentcontinues  to  be in  services,  especially business  services  and healthcare.  Within business  services,  temporary help  agencies  are  doingvery well.  Demand for workers  in information technology  fields  isespecially high, as  I have  said before,  and there is  talk of  importing7/2-3/96-20-labor, particularly  telecommunications specialists,  from other regionsof  the  country and of  the  inability of  some money management  firms  tofind even back office  staff.  We have noted that  the nature  of  theworkplace is  changing.  One of  our manufacturing  contacts, who makesmachine  tools  for  the  auto industry, currently has  100  to  150engineers working on a temporary basis.  These people will be  let  goas  the  engineering phase  of  the project  is  completed, and he will  thenhire  temporary production workers  in their place.  There is  a lot ofchange  going on  in how employers  are hiring even in  skilledoccupations.Although manufacturing employment  in New England  continues  todrift  downward, the  rate of  decline has  slowed, and the high-tech  areaseems  to  be  stabilizing  at  last.  Employment  in  computer and officeequipment manufacturing has picked up over  the  first  half of  the yearafter a very long period of  decline.  Even the  cutbacks in  defensespending seem  to be coming  to an end.  Layoffs  are  still ahead  inConnecticut  at  Electric Boat,  but defense  contractors  in both NewHampshire  and Vermont  are planning to  add workers  because  of newcontracts.  The anecdotal  evidence  from  the manufacturing sector isgenerally positive.  Materials prices have moved around a bit but arenot  rising overall.  Selling prices are  up very slightly, but peoplecontinue  to  say  that  it  is  very hard to  raise prices.  Inventories aregenerally at  satisfactory levels,  though  companies  continue to  findways  of  bringing them down, often through  innovative technologies.  Acouple of  manufacturing contacts  commented on the prospect  of  lowerelectricity prices  arising  from deregulation of  the  industry.Deregulation  of  electricity could have  some  fairly significant butdifficult-to-anticipate  consequences, particularly  for the New Englandeconomy where electricity prices  are unusually high.The  retail picture  in New England  remains  difficult to assessbecause  retail  competition is  so  fierce.  Some companies  are doingwell, but  others are  experiencing sales  declines  and even bankruptcybecause  of  new entries  into  the  market.  Retail  inventories  seem to bein pretty good shape  and price  increases,  if  any, are very moderate.Our  real  estate contacts  report  mixed signals  in recent months  after avery strong  first quarter.  However, housing  activity is  quite high ineastern Massachusetts, with both existing and new homes moving well.For  example, last  Sunday's Boston Globe had a front  page story thatbegan as  follows:  "Housing inventory has been drastically reduced  inthe  suburbs  and cut  in  half  in  the  city over  the past  12  months.Demand  is  astonishingly high, and properties  are  selling within daysof  coming on the market."  That  news  item was basically residentiallyoriented, but the  commercial  real estate market  in  the greater  Bostonarea  is  also  quite healthy.  Brokers  report  that building prices  insuburban Boston  are back to their peak of  the  late  1980s,  althoughprices downtown still  have  some distance  to  go.  The Providence marketis  improving  and commercial  space  is  reported to be  fully  occupiedeven  in Springfield.  Now, if we  could just do  something aboutHartford and New Haven, the  First  District as  a whole would be back  tohigh-occupancy levels.Growth in bank  lending remains below that  of  the nation,  inpart because  of balance  sheet  restructuring  efforts  on  the part ofnewly merged large banks.  However, reports  of  keen competitioncontinue.  The  senior lending officer  for  a large nationwide insurancecompany told me  that  he has almost never seen  such an availability of7/2-3/96-21-capital.  From venture capital, mezzanine  financing, to  commercialloans  and mortgage  lending,  according  to him almost any project  canget  financed.  He  and others believe  that  the  IPO market  in particularhas  gotten frothy of  late.On  the national  scene, we  agree with the  Greenbook  that  therisks  seem  even more heavily weighted to  the up  side,  especially  forthe  near  term.  We  see  fairly  strong second and third quarters,  withmoderation after  that.  But  the resulting rise  in  inflation that  wesee  is  somewhat  larger  than  in the  Greenbook  even in  the  face  of  someincrease  in  interest rates,  which we have  factored  into our baseline.Moreover, when we  look  at  the  tighter  federal  funds  scenario  that  theGreenbook assumes,  we see  higher  inflation,  lower unemployment,  and abetter growth path  than  is  presented in  the  Greenbook numbers.  Thus,we might  see both  a greater need and a greater ability to  tightenpolicy than  is  reflected in  the Greenbook.

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  PhiladelphiaDistrict economy is  growing at  a moderate pace,  and virtually allsectors  are sharing  in  the growth.  That  is  an improvement  overconditions  last year and early this year.  Still,  the  region lags  theperformance  of  the  nation, and that  is  not  likely to change  in  theforeseeable  future.  Wage  and price pressures  appear to be  contained.Although labor markets have  tightened  some,  there  is  no  obviousacceleration in wage gains.  Raising prices  also  seems  to  be difficultbecause of  competitive pressures.The national  economy continues  to perform at  levels  thatshould generate accelerating price pressures, judging  from pastexperience.  Yet,  there are  few  signs of  accelerating movements  incore prices.  Perhaps there will be more signs  and perhaps  therewon't.  I think we need to  be watchful.  Some moderation  in the paceof  real  economic growth  is  likely during the  second half  of  1996  andinto  1997.  The  increase  in  longer-term  interest  rates  almost  surelywill damp  interest-sensitive  expenditures.  Consumption spendinggenerally will  likely grow more  in  line with disposable  income anddebt  levels.  Growth  in business  fixed investment  is  alreadymoderating.  Increases  in  government  spending also  should moderate.Only  inventory investment  looks  notably  stronger  for  the  second half.So,  all  in all,  the  economy is  not  likely to  break away on the upside.  Nonetheless,  I think we need  to  be watchful here  as  well.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the  economy  in our Districtcontinues  to  grow at a relatively strong pace, with gains  spreadbroadly across most of  our  industries.  Manufacturing and constructionremain major  sources  of  strength in our region.  Factory jobs  in  theDistrict  rose  again in April,  and industry contacts  indicate  thatproduction schedules remain  strong.  In addition, our directors  reportbrisk activity in  construction, although slightly less  than earlier  inthe  year.  Retail  sales  also  continue to  improve  across  the District.While retailers  and automobile  dealers  report modest  sales  gains, mostexpect sales  to  strengthen  further during  the  remainder of  thissummer.  Energy activity continues  to strengthen in  our Districtdespite  somewhat weaker crude  oil  and natural  gas prices.  Drilling7/2-3/96-22-activity increased in May  for the fourth  consecutive month and is  upnoticeably over  a year ago.  The  agricultural area  remains weak bothin  the cattle  industry and with crops where prices  are  good but someof  our producers got  about half  a crop at  most, some none.While economic  activity is  generally solid across  theDistrict,  we have  seen signs  of  very modest  price pressures  in  theretail  sales  area.  However, there  continue to be  strong indicationsof  tight  labor markets.  With regard  to  the  anecdotal  information,  amajor distributor  of housewares  headquartered in our region  indicatedthat  there  actually has been a small  decrease in  the prices  of  theproducts that  they purchase for  sale  across  the United States,  perhapsin  the neighborhood of  1 percent,  in  contrast  to  consistent  2 percentincreases  in  the  last  several years.  However,  their wage  costs  arerising.  The  average increase  this year will be  in  the  4 percent rangefor new entrants,  6 percent  for  those  in  the  training  or  the  salesareas,  and even higher for  other workers.  So,  they are experiencingdiffering pressures  in their  costs  of  doing business.On the  national  level,  I am broadly in  agreement with theGreenbook and  look  for second-quarter growth  of  3-1/2  to  4 percent,with growth moderating toward  2-1/4 percent  near  the  end of  the year.Looking  into next year and assuming current  interest  rates,  I wouldexpect growth  to  remain slightly above potential.  Like  the  Greenbook,I believe  the risks  are  largely on  the up  side.  Virtually all  sectorslook solid.  While we would expect higher  long-term  interest  rates  totemper demand, it  is  possible  that  interest-sensitive sectors  of  theeconomy may be more resilient  to  higher rates  than we formerlybelieved.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The Eleventh District  economy  is  doing verywell.  Employment  grew at  a rate of  about 4 percent  in April and May,and most observers  do  not expect much slowdown in the  second half.For reference, our  long-term employment  growth  trend is  around 3percent.  On  the negative side,  the  mantra in  Texas  is  still  "eat beefand pray for  rain."  The drought  continues  and it  is  as  bad as  it  hasever been.  It  has not been as  prolonged as yet,  so  we do  not hearquite  as  much about  it.  Willie Nelson's  Fourth of July party  inLuckenbach  is  dedicated to  raising money for  rain-starved ranchers andfarmers.  He  is  not  worried much  about  the  ag bankers  as yet![Laughter]  Neither are  our  supervision  people;  we had a talk  aboutthat.  The  condition of  the  ag banks  is  pretty good and crop  insuranceis  very prevalent,  so  that  will  ease the  situation.  The effect  of  thedrought on  Texas  agriculture  is  estimated at  $2.4  billion or  about  .5percent  of  gross state product.  Last year the  ag sector represented1.8  percent  of gross  state product  and 1.3  percent  of  employment.Just  for  comparison, in  1940  agriculture represented 30  percent ofTexas employment.Cow chips  have been replaced by computer chips  in  the Texaseconomy.  [Laughter]  The  semiconductor  industry has reboundedsomewhat  from a disappointing performance earlier  in the  year.  Theconstruction of  several  new wafer  fabrication plants  is  being sloweddown or put  on hold, but  other  similar projects are  moving full  speedahead.  Computer chips have replaced the oil  and the  real  estatebusiness as  the  source of  Texas  excess spent more7/2-3/96-23-Indicators  of  the  District's  high-tech  sectorthan  $1 million on  the  groundbreaking party the  other day for  its  newchip  factory have picked up recently.  The book-to-bill ratio has  increased  forthree  months  in a row, to  .84  in May, but was  still  below the year-agolevel  of  1.18.  After  I wrote  that,  I read an  article  in the  DallasMorning News  by the number  two person  at  Texas  Instruments who arguedthat  the book-to-bill ratio  is worthless  as  an  indicator.  So  you canstrike that!The energy sector has been  doing better  lately, and not  somuch because of  higher prices.  Past downsizing and improved drillingtechnologies  that have  reduced the  number  of  dry holes being drilledare  improving profitability.  Five years  ago when I went  to  Texas,  itwas  thought  that  $25  to  $27  oil  was necessary for  drilling in  newfields.  Now it  is  felt  that  such drilling can be profitable  in  the$18  to  $19  range.  Drilling in  the  Gulf  of Mexico has been constrainedrecently by a shortage  of  rigs.The rebound  in  the Mexican  economy, which has been going onfor  a year now, is  being increasingly felt  in  the Texas  economy.Southbound train and  truck traffic is  up more than 50  percent  fromlast year's  lows.  Retail  sales  to Mexican  citizens have  improvednoticeably  in  our border  towns  and in Houston.  Our  indexes of  leadingindicators,  for both Mexico and Texas,  are  signaling continued  growthin  the coming months.  The Mexican rebound will  likely get  a lot moreattention  in  the press  in about a month when the  second-quarterresults  are  in.  That  GDP number will  be  contrasted to  the  secondquarter  of  1995,  which was the  bottom of  their recession, and it  islikely to be  a very large positive number.  Of  course,  the Achillesheel  of  the Mexican economy is  the dire banking  situation.The  national  economy has continued  to  strengthen since  ourlast meeting.  We in Dallas believe  that  the real GDP number  in  thesecond quarter  will be more  than  4 percent--possibly 5 percent--ratherthan  just under 4 percent.  The growth in  employment  has continued tosurprise us  on the  up side.  The  implications  for  inflation, however,are not  that  clear  to  me,  although the  risks  certainly have  increasedon the up  side  and are clearly  asymmetric.  But on  the  comfortingside,  much of  the  increase  in consumer  inflation so  far  this  year hasbeen in  energy, which should ease  during  the  remainder of  the year.Commodity and metals prices peaked some  time  ago, and gold is  now nearits  12-month low.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  Southeast economycontinues  to  grow moderately, slightly outperforming the  nation byalmost all  measures.  Georgia and Florida particularly are doingextremely well.  Although much  of  that can be attributed to  theOlympics,  the District would still be performing quite well  evenwithout  the  Olympics.  There are  a few imbalances and  those  that  existare  not  surprising.  Tourism  throughout  our Southeast region wouldhave to be  characterized as  spectacular,  as  it  should be going intothe  Olympics.  Florida  tourism is  having a record year.  Manufacturingactivity is  steady.  Employment  and  orders were up  just  a little  inrecent months.  Apparel  remains weak.  Alabama, Tennessee,  and Georgiahave lost  almost one-third of  their apparel manufacturing  employmentover  the  last  four years.  That  loss  is  occurring in  regions where  the7/2-3/96-24-new southern automobile  industry is  moving in,  and  it  is  a perfectexample  of  the mismatch between the  qualifications of  many of  thejobless who are  leaving the  apparel  industry and the  qualificationsneeded  for  the  new jobs  in the  automobile  industry.  Single-familyhousing activity generally remains  good, with inventory shortages  ofsingle-family homes  reported in  some  of  our areas.  Multifamilyoccupancy remains quite high and building of  such  units  continues.Commercial real  estate activity is  strong except  for  the  retailingsector.  Labor shortages  and wage pressures now exist  in severaland construction.  But  it  is  our  sense that  those should abate  as  weget past  the  Olympics  and as  housing and other  construction slows  aswe expect.There  is  a lot of  discussion and we get  a lot of  questionsabout  the  economic  impact of  the Olympics.  Our  judgment  is  that  themacro impact will  be quite  small.  Only foreign  tourists who would nototherwise  have come  to  the United States  will make a net  contributionto  GDP.  Everything  else  is  a substitution or  a change  in timing andby that  I mean the  building of  facilities a little early to  have themopen  in time  for  the  Olympics.  Our best guess  is  that  totalconstruction that  would not have  occurred were  it  not  for  the Olympicstotals  less than  $1/4  billion.  Also, our best guess  on the  employmentgains  that  can be  expected during  the Olympics  is  that  60,000  to70,000  jobs will  be  added at  the peak.  That peak  falls between  twoemployment  survey periods.  Our  guess  is  that  the July survey willpick up about  40,000  of  those Olympic  jobs  and most will be gone  bythe August  survey.  Our sense  from  talking to  people  in  the  communityis  that many of  those jobs  are  second jobs or  retirees who are  comingout  of  retirement  just  for  a few weeks  and have  no  intention ofstaying in  the workforce.  Our best  estimates  are  that  the gains willcontribute  about  $5 to  $6 billion  to  the  District over  five years,  thebulk of  that  coming about now.  So,  on a regional basis  it  certainlyis  a big deal.As  far  as  the near-term outlook for  the  national economy  isconcerned,  the Atlanta forecast  and that  in  the  Greenbook are almostindistinguishable.  Both see  a spurt  in  activity in  the  secondquarter;  both show a slowing  in the  second half  of  the year based onexpectations  of  a deceleration or  outright decline  in housing activitycombined with the  already observed moderation in  the  growth ofbusiness  fixed investment.  Each forecast also  shows  the CPI  at  about3 percent and little  change  in  the unemployment  rate.  Notwithstandingthese  similarities,  we have  a somewhat different  interpretation ofrecent  events.  I contrast  our  outlook with the  Greenbook's not  bydisputing  that  demand is  relatively  strong but by noting that  recenthistory shows  that  increases  in demand and  increases  in relativeprices  that  accompany it  very quickly elicit  increases  in  supply,which sharply reduce upward price pressures.  If we  have  learnedanything from the  last  five years of  expansion,  it  is  that  a focus  ondemand  to  the exclusion  of  supply and competitive pressures may nottell  the whole  story.  Importantly, the change  in the  dynamics ofdemand and supply relationships  makes  traditional  measures ofpotential  price pressures,  such  as  capacity utilization and theunemployment rate,  less  reliable  in our view than in  the past.Against  this broad framework, we do not believe that we have  alreadyaccommodated an increase  in demand.  Consequently,  common observationsabout  the strength in  current and prospective activity lead me  to7/2-3/96-25-temper my interpretations of  at  least overall price pressures beyondthe  forecast  horizon.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  The pace  of  economic  activity inthe  Eighth District  continues  to pick up  from  the  more  sluggish levelsI mentioned earlier  in  the year.  District retailers  and auto  dealersreport sales  at  or above  last year's  levels,  and most  contacts areoptimistic  about sales  prospects  over  the  summer, though  there  is  someconcern about consumer debt  levels.  District payroll  employment grewat  an annual  rate of  2.2  percent  for the  three months  ended in April,slightly below the  national rate.  Nonetheless, unemployment  rates  inthe  District remain below the national  average.  The  District laborentry-level  workers--for example,  in the  fast  food area--by offeringstarting bonuses  and wages well  above the minimum wage.  Poultryproducers  in parts  of  the  District continue  to attract workers  fromMexico.  There  also  are growing wage pressures  for  skilled workers.Computer-literate workers  in a variety of  occupations  are  in shortsupply.  There  is  also  some restiveness  on  the part of  organizedlabor.  The  strike at McDonnell  Douglas by  about  6,700  unionmachinists,  which began on June  5, continues  though negotiations wererestarted last  week with the  involvement  of a mediator.  The proposedfour-year contract--and this  is  what was  originally on  the  tablebefore the  strike--includes a cost-of-living adjustment plus  a 2-1/2percent  increase  in base  salaries  during  the  first  year  of  thecontract and 2-1/2  to  3 percent bonus  increases  during  the  remainderof  the  contract.  So,  that  contract works out  to  an annual  increase  inthe  range of  5 to  6 percent.  That  Boeing and other companies  havebeen actively wooing  striking McDonnell  Douglas machinists  to  leaveSt.  Louis  is  another  indication that  the  market  for machinists  istight.  Whether  tight  labor markets get  reflected further  in  risingwages  and prices  remains  to be  seen, although I suspect  they will.District auto  output has  been unusually strong,  and  automakers in  the District  expect production  to  be up  about  16-1/2  percentin  the  third quarter  over a year  earlier.  There has been asubstantial  increase  in  the capacity to  produce popular models.Nationally, light  trucks  and autos  are  selling at  a pace unmatchedsince  1988.  A surge  in automotive  output  in the  second quarter  tomeet  consumer demand and  rebuild inventories  is  expected to  increasereal GDP  growth by more than  a percentage point at  an  annual rate.With respect  to  inventories generally,  the main National Federation ofIndependent Businesses  survey suggests  that about  one-fifth ofDistrict  firms  want  to  add  to  stocks while  a slightly smaller  fractionof  District  firms want  to reduce  them.  Residential building permitspicked up  substantially  in April  in most District metropolitan  areas,though builders still  expect  a slowdown because  of  recent  increases  inmortgage rates.  Loan  growth at  District banks  continues  slightlyfaster than in  the  nation.  Finally, crop  conditions  are better  thanwas  expected earlier.With respect to  the  national economic  outlook, we  areforecasting  continued real  growth  at essentially  the  average  growthrate  of  the past  ten years  in  terms  of  the new chain-weightedmeasures.  We are  forecasting  real  growth of  about  2-1/2  to  2-3/4percent  this year and 2 to  3 percent  in 1997.  We have  the7/2-3/96-26-unemployment rate  holding in  the  range of  5-1/2  to  6 percent.  We donot  see  a recession  over the next year and a half,  although I am awarethat  forecasters  generally are not  able  to  tell  a boom from a bust  12months hence.  Our CPI  forecast  is  for 3 to  3-1/2  percent  inflation  in1996,  up  from 2.7  percent  in  1995.  However, assuming  that policymoves aggressively  toward restraint  during the  remainder of  this year,we believe  inflation could move down  to  the 2 to  3 percent range  in1997.  The slowing  in  inflation that  we  forecast will  not  occur  if  thecurrent  inflation  gets  embedded in  expectations, which we  see  as  agrowing  risk given  the accommodative  stance of  monetary policy.One  final comment with  respect  to  the  forecast:  I amconcerned about how these  forecasts may be  interpreted.  We  are askedto  prepare  forecasts based on what we  think  an appropriate  policystance would be, although  the policy assumptions  themselves  are notpublished with the  forecast or  for  that  matter even  requested.  If  theFOMC  consensus  happened to  be identical  to  the  St.  Louis  forecast  oflower  inflation in  1997,  would the interpretation by the public bethat nothing more needs  to  be done  to  contain inflation?  There  is  thedilemma.  On the  one hand, if  we  forecast  accelerating inflationassuming no  change  in  the  stance of  policy, we  may make it  easier  totake appropriate actions  to  contain  it.  On  the  other  hand, if  weforecast decelerating  inflation predicated on  a tightening of  policy,we may make  it more  difficult in  fact  to  take the necessary actions.Either way our credibility could be damaged.  I think we  should makeit  clear  in publishing our  forecasts  that the  outcomes  are notindependent  of policy  actions  and may in  fact presume  some  tighteningactions.  Having  said  that,  our forecasts  of variables  that we  caninfluence,  namely inflation in  future years,  are  important  to markets.We  ought  to use  every opportunity to  forecast  lower  inflation  in theyears  ahead and do  our best to  make  such  an outcome  a reality.

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The regional  economycontinues  to do well.  Most sectors  are healthy.  Construction  inparticular  is  strong, housing  is  very strong,  and home prices  arerising significantly.  Those  conditions have prevailed for quite  sometime now, and I won't  elaborate.  Exceptions to  this generallyfavorable  set of conditions  are weather-related problems adverselyaffecting tourism and agriculture.  The  cattle  industry continues,  ofcourse,  to  have serious  difficulties.I have commented on  this before but  I think it  is  worthmentioning again  that  labor is  scarce  in the  District.  There  seems  tobe  a shortage, especially of  entry-level workers,  and we  see  signs  ofwage pressures  at  that  level.  When we  talk to  some  people about  that,the  attitude  seems  to be  that,  of  course,  the  entry-level  labor forceis  mostly young and  inexperienced, very mobile.  These people areanxious  to  get  some  training but  they do not care  at  all about  thebenefits  that might go  with the  job.  So  once they get  the  training orif  they get  an offer of  somewhat higher  earnings across  the  street oracross  the  city, they will  move on.  More experienced workers  seem  tobe  a good deal  less  mobile.  They put a higher value  on benefits,  andthey  are  concerned about  the  obsolescence of  their  skills.labor  leaderwas using a lot of  language like  "labor isn't  very comfortable,"At a meeting  that he  attended a couple  of weeks ago, he7/2-3/96-27-"labor  isn't very confident,"  and so  on.  I did not have  the  sensethat he was choosing his words  that  carefully just  to  influence us.  Ithink what he was  saying  is  an  accurate  reflection of  attitudes  in afairly well  organized,  fairly highly skilled labor  force.As  far as  the  national  economy  is  concerned, my view ofcurrent  conditions  is  that  they are  too good  to  last.  Relative to  ourexpectations of  late  last  year and early this year, the  economycertainly has  done  better, perhaps  considerably better,  thanindividual  Committee  members expected.  The Greenbook  forecast  hasaggregate  demand slowing  just perfectly to  the  trend growth  ofaggregate  supply.  We  achieve  equilibrium and in  some sense we oughtto  close up  shop!  My experience  tells me that  such a very smoothadjustment  is  highly unlikely and that may be putting the best  face  onit.  Things  are unlikely to work out  that  favorably.  I do expect thataggregate  demand will  slow, but not  so  much and not  so rapidly as  inthe  Greenbook,  in part because  I think the  expansion has  a good dealof momentum right now and in part because  I do  not see anycorroborating evidence at  the moment  that such  slowing  is  in train.This  leads me  to  the conclusion  that  sooner or  later  the  growth  of  theeconomy will  strain capacity, and so  I am concerned about  prospectiveinflationary pressures.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  for  the  last threeyears  I have been reporting on  the  economy of  the Second District inrather dismal  terms,  and I am now changing from a minor to  a majorkey.  The Second District economy has been accelerating in recentweeks  and the reason  is  that  the District  is  amazingly  dependent botheconomically and, perhaps  more  important, psychologically on what  ishappening in  the New York metropolitan area.  Economic  conditionsthere  seem to be very much on an upbeat.  Payroll employment rose at  arapid clip  in May in  the  District  following a pause  in April.  NewYork State  added 16,700 jobs;  that  is  an annualized gain of  2.6percent.  The unemployment  rate held steady at  6.4  percent.  In NewJersey,  employment  expanded 2.3  percent with  6,800  jobs and theunemployment rate  fell  to  6.1 percent, which is  a five-year low.  Thejob growth was, not  surprisingly, dominated by gains  in business andconsumer  services.  Manufacturing continues  to decline  in  theDistrict.  The  real  estate  industry is  beginning to pick up.  But as  Isaid  earlier,  I think the biggest change  is happening  in the  "feel"  ofNew York City.  Some changes are  in  the purely economic  area and someare not.  The City  is  absolutely booming with tourists.  That  ishelped a great  deal  by the  fact  that  it  feels  a lot  safer,  and  thatfeeling is  not  unrelated to  a different  approach to policing.  Thepolice also have  been perhaps  brilliant, perhaps  lucky, perhaps  someof  each,  in  solving some very difficult  and problematic  serial crimes.The  teachers  of  the City of New York, about  110,000  in number, who hadturned down their  labor contract  late  last  year, have now approved it,even though  there  are no pay increases in  the  first  two  years.  TheNew York City partnership, which has  had a spectacular  success  inpromoting  lower-level  and middle-level housing in the  city over  recentyears,  has  announced the  creation of what  is  essentially  a start-upventure  capital  fund of  $50  million, and the  rather brilliant  ladyexecutive  who was head of  the housing partnership  is  going to moveover  to  run that.  Perhaps  equally important,  the Yankees  are having a7/2-3/96-28-great  season and last night  they scored their  second run  on a squeezebunt, which is  the baseball  equivalent  of  "chutzpah."  The  goodfeeling  from New York City seems  to  be moving  out  into northern NewJersey and the  rest  of  New York State,  and the  District as  a whole  isdoing very well.On  the  national  level,  our forecast  for  the rest  of  this yearis  virtually equivalent  to  that  of  the  Greenbook.  For 1997,  we havesome difference  of  opinion.  It  is  largely related to  my question toMike Prell  concerning what  is  going to  happen  to productivity since ithas not  been showing all  the  improvement  that  we have been waitingfor.  My colleagues  in New York are  inclined to  think that  it  could goin  the  opposite direction, which would give us  weaker growth nextyear.  We also have  inflation  ticking up as  the Greenbook does  to  3.0percent next year.  Our views  are based  on models  that  all  of  us  haveto  use  and that  have the  quality of  thinking  that past  events  arelikely to be  repeated in  the  future.  Intellectually,  I think that  isprobably very sound.  However,  I am having  great difficulty trying  toreconcile my  intuition and my mind.That may be because  of my strong reaction to  what  I think  isa very unfortunate  debate going  on  in the  country with those whoconsider price  stability as  somehow antagonistic  to growth.  Thehigher  the growth, the more we  have to worry about price  stability inthat view.  Some  of  us  unfortunately have  contributed to  that debate.At the  same  time,  what my  intuition  is  telling me  is  that,  rather likethe  comments the  Chairman made  in response to  a question by PresidentMinehan, there may in  fact  be developments on  the  cost  side,  on  thewage  side, and  therefore  in the  future  on the price  side that we  donot  fully understand.  I think it  probably would not be  a very goodidea  for us  to move policy at  a time when the  outlook  for  what we  areuniquely responsible  for, which  is  price stability,  is  questionableboth  intellectually and practically.  So,  I think we must  busyourselves  between now and the next meeting with  trying to  understandas  best we can what  if  anything new is  happening,  as you  suggested inyour  remarks, Mr. Chairman.  I know that  you are  planning to  go  intothat more fully  tomorrow, and  I look forward  to hearing your comments.Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I will  begin by saying  that  we seem  to have"weathered" another price scare  in agriculture.  At  the May meeting, Ireported on the  wet conditions  that were panicking  the  farmers  in  ourarea.  Many had sold crops  that  they had not yet planted, and becauseof  the  adverse weather  conditions the  day was  getting very close whenit  would be  too  late  in the  season for  them to plant  a crop.  This  wasgoing to be  a very big problem.  In  fact,  there  is  an article  intoday's Wall  Street Journal about  some  of  the  problems stemming fromthat.  However,  our farmers  got  a window of  a few dry days,  as we  areprone  to  get  every year  in  our region.  Because of  "no till"  farming,they  are now able  to  get  a crop in  the  ground in  a few days  thatliterally would have  taken weeks before.  This  raises  some  interestingquestions about  measuring productivity in  agriculture.  What we wouldcompare  is  a crop that was planted under old  technology with one thatwas  planted under new technology to  see how much  less  labor was used.But  how do we  take  into account  crops  that  simply would not  have beenplanted under old technology because it  was  too  late  in  the  season  to7/2-3/96-29-do  so?  In  any  event,  we are  going to have  a good agricultural  year  inour region  even though  our productivity figures  are not  going to  showthe real  benefits of  the new technology.At  the March  and May meetings, we were worried  that  the risein  energy and food prices would become more generalized  throughoutthe  economy and would therefore  set a tone  of broadly escalating ratesof  inflation.  It  now seems  that  this  has been another episode  likelast year's  paper price  scare when the  concern was  that we were  goingto have  shortages  of  paper forever.  That  fear has  now vanished.Before  that  it was metals.  Last year we also had to worry about  Class8 trucks  being produced at  unsustainable  levels well above capacity,but  now the production levels  are down 25  percent  from  a year ago.  Atone point we worried  about escalating prices  of  lumber and otherbuilding materials  as being the  acorn that  could grow into  ageneralized inflation.  One  after another,  these  concerns  have poppedup and have  gone away.  In  line with Jack Guynn's  remarks,  I thinkthat  these  are good reminders  that  generalized price  inflation is  notcaused by isolated events.  As  long as  we keep  an  effective  lid on  thegrowth  of  aggregate  demand, these price  changes,  up and down, arecritical really  to  the efficient  performance  of  the  economy.I want  to  comment about  the productivity issue.  BillMcDonough raised  some  questions  about  the  labor productivity chart  inthe  Chart  Show and Larry Meyer also made reference  to  it.  When welook at  a chart  like  that, we  know that  for a growing share  of  theeconomy there  is  no  improvement in  labor productivity because  wemeasure  the output  in  those parts of  the economy by labor  inputs  andwe define  the  latter as not having any productivity  growth.  So,  thereis  both a cyclical dimension and a secular dimension  to  that  chart.The  cyclical  relates  to periods when there  is  a pickup  in  economicactivity that  tends  to  be concentrated  in sectors  of the  economy,notably in manufacturing where, according to  the  data that we  use, theproportion  of  labor having high productivity growth  rises relative  tolabor defined as  having no productivity improvement.  In  such  a periodwe would expect  to  see an  increase  in  overall productivity  and viceversa  in a cyclical downturn.  But  in  the  secular  sense, we are movingincreasingly toward a situation where  labor productivity  in  that chartwill  have no growth  at  all.  If  we define  99  percent of  the  economy asinvolving  industries where there  is  no  labor productivity growth,  thenthe  economy's  overall  productivity growth has  to  approach zero.  So,instead  of  saying that productivity has  been  stuck at  1 percent  or  1.1percent  or whatever the  number  is,  the question should be, why hasn'tit  gone down?The  anecdotal  reports  at  the  micro level  tell  us  thatproductivity is  booming, especially in manufacturing whereproductivity gains  of  4 or  5 percent  or  sometimes even  6 or 7 percentare mentioned.  In  order not  to  have  one  iota of  improvement  inproductivity at  the macro  level,  as  somebody was  quoted as  saying, wehave  to have  at  least  a sharp  slowing in productivity growth  innonmanufacturing sectors  of  the  economy if  not an absolute decline.Then the  question becomes,  is  that  credible given what  is  going  on  inthe  world today?  Statistically, we  know how it  is  happening.  We  knowthat  total  factor productivity  is measured as  declining  in  suchsectors  as  financial  services,, because output is  falling or  there  isless  labor  employed with more nonlabor  factors.  As a result we havenegative  total  factor productivity.  We  add that  to manufacturing7/2-3/96-30-which has big productivity  gains,  and there  it  is,  1 percentproductivity growth again.  But  that  is  really masking  the  dynamics ofwhat  is  going on  in  the  economy.  We  all  know that  at  the  micro levelimproved productivity means  less  inflationary pressure, but  thensomehow we get caught  up  in this  loop  that  says  increased productivitygets  added together with  labor.  This means more  output  and thatsomehow causes  inflation.  That  does  not  compute.As  we go  around the  Fourth  District asking  questions aboutplans  for price  increases,  the disconnect  in  the  responses  that  we  getis  certainly  interesting and  I suspect  a lot  of  business people  thinkthe same way as  our contacts.  When we  ask  them what  their pricingplans  are  for  their products  over  the next  five  years,  they  say theyare  going to  try to maintain  their prices or  reduce  them as  slowly aspossible.  We  do not hear  anybody  talking about raising prices.  Thequestion for  these people  is  whether  they  can assume  that  their priceswill stay  the  same  or how much  they think  they may have  to  cut  them.Then we ask  them, what  is  their  inflation forecast?  They will  usuallygive a number  like  3 percent.  When we ask why, they say that  is  theCPI  rate  of  inflation.  When we probe  into  this,  we  find  it mainlymeans that  that  is  what  they  think is  going  to happen  to  their laborcosts.  Then we  ask, how does  this  work?  If  you are not going  toincrease  the prices  of  your products  and your wages  are going  to  go up3 percent  on average,  how do you do  it?  Then they tell  usproductivity stories.  It  is  interesting in  an  ironic way that,  for  alot  of  the  economy, the more efficient  the  sector,  the less  productiveit  is  estimated  to  be,  if  we can  figure  out what  that means.We also  ask people  a lot  of questions  about  what  they worryabout.  The  frequency with which  companies  talk about  financialstresses  is  interesting.  Generally, we  hear comments  from bankers  andnonbankers  alike who  are worried about  declining credit quality,slowing collections  of  receivables,  and rising delinquencies  and latepayments.  Such  comments are  more  frequent than Mike's  charts wouldsuggest or  than  the  national data  show.  Companies  tell us  that  theywere surprised  at  how good  the  first half  was but also  that  their  freecash  flow is  falling.  So  something  is  not quite right.  In  the secondhalf of  this  year, if  the  Greenbook forecast  is  correct, we  will  haveto be  alert  to  the  debt  service burdens, which will be  a growingproblem because  those Greenbook numbers  imply that  revenue  and salesgrowth will  be a lot  slower.  We  are going  to  see  squeezes  onearnings,  as  most firms  expect  and the national projections  suggest.We will  hear more stories  about  the  cost  of  carrying the  inventorythat apparently is  being built up,  and people  are  going to  say thattheir financing  is  getting more burdensome.  So,  I think that  sixmonths  from now we may be  quite  concerned about more  financialstresses  in  the  economy than  seem to  exist  today.Let me also comment  about the  labor markets.  There  is  goodnews/bad news  in  the Bluebooks.  I went back over  the  last  six yearsof  these semiannual  projection exercises,  at  the beginning of  the yearand in July,  that look out  five years.  The  good news  is  that thestaff keeps notching down the  unemployment  rates  associated with  agiven  inflation path and  the  inflation path has  not been notched up.If  anything, it  is  down slightly over  those  semiannual  intervals.  Itry to  imagine what we will be looking at  when we  come  back in Januaryor  February for  the next  semiannual  review.  Currently and  for thelast year, all  but  four of  the  large  eleven states  for which we have7/2-3/96-31-the  data have unemployment rates  that  are well below the  5-3/4  percentstaff  estimate of  the  NAIRU.  Three of  the  four other states,  as  weheard this  afternoon, have experienced rapid growth  in  employment:California,  Texas  and New York.  Bill  McDonough mentioned thatunemployment  fell  to  a five-year  low in  the  fourth state, New Jersey.The unemployment rate  for  the other  seven  states  is  below 5 percent.What is  going  to  happen?  If  employment continues  to grow as  rapidlyas people  anticipate  and the unemployment  rate  moves down  in  someother states,  especially those  that produce motor vehicles--MikeMoskow mentioned Wisconsin and we  know that very low unemploymentrates  already  exist in Kentucky and Tennessee--will we  talk six monthsfrom now about  5 percent  unemployment and yet lower  inflation?  I hopeso.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I think these  semiannual meetings are  best usedto  assess whether  there are any major  trends that have  surprised us.There are  two  that have surprised me:  consumer debt and public policy.I will  restrict my comments  to  consumer debt.I think the  consumer  situation  is  best  summed up by the  oldlabor ballad about  "another day older and deeper  in debt."  The balladconcludes with  the phrase,  "I owe  my soul  to  the  company  store."  Ofcourse,  the  song was written  in a less  enlightened time  than thepresent  one.  Today the singer would simply declare bankruptcy![Laughter]  The reason all  this  is  a surprise to  me  is  that  18 monthsago  I thought  the consumer would have cut back  spending by now eitherout  of  voluntary recognition of  the  family  financial  situation orbecause  creditors would have  stopped extending additional  credit.Neither has  occurred.  In  fact,  it  is  now obvious  that  creditextensions continue  to mushroom in  at  least  some  areas.  Credit  ismuch easier to  get  than  it  was  18 months  ago.  Revolving creditincreased $75  billion  in the  12  months  ended in April  according to  ourlatest  statistical  release.  That  is  a 20.5 percent  annual  increase.Auto credit  increased only 10  percent  and total  consumer credit was  up13  percent.  Our  1995  Survey of  Consumer Finances, when adjusted tomatch flow of  funds  data to  overall household debt,  shows  that roughlyone  household in  six now pays  40  percent  or more  of  its  income  indebt-service payments.This  is  showing up in consumer delinquency rates.  In  thefirst quarter,  just under  3 percent of  all  auto  loans  at  financecompanies were  30  or more days  delinquent.  In 1991  when theunemployment  rate was  6.8  percent, which was  the previous peak, thedelinquency rate  was  2.65  percent.  Credit  card delinquencies  atcommercial banks were 3.49  percent  in  the  first quarter  of  this yearand they were  3.21 percent  at  the previous peak in  1991.  Interest-ingly,  the Survey of  Consumer Finance  shows  that  the usual  signs  ofeconomic distress were not  the  cause.  The proportion  of  consumerswith debt payments  exceeding  40  percent  of  income who  reported eitherunemployment  during the  survey year  or unusually low income  for  theyear was actually lower  in 1995  than  in  1992.  That may help  explainwhy the new computerized underwriting procedures continue  to  extendever more credit  even as  debt  levels  grow.  The  traditional warningflags  simply are not present  for the  great majority of  people who aretaking on new debt.7/2-3/96-32-Anecdotally,  lenders invariably cite  "competitive pressures"as  the  reason  for granting ever more  and ever  riskier  credit.  Icalled up  the American Automotive Manufacturers Association  (AAMA) toget some  feel  for  their view on  credit.  The average  term for  theirmembers  in extending credit  is  between 52  and 57  months.  The standardoffer now is  60  months,  although one of  the  captive auto  financecompanies  is  now offering a 72-month loan  on minivans.  The reasonthey gave  for  extending the maturity on  such  loans was  competitivepressure from  the banks.  My colleagues on  the  Board might  chucklesince the  members  of  TIAC, who were  here last week, were  saying  thatthey were now offering 72-month loans  and even  some  84-month loans.The  reason given was competitive  pressure from  the  auto  financecompanies!  When I hear about an  84-month auto  loan, I know that  thecredit merry-go-round has  not  stopped and  it  is probably picking upspeed.  But  I do not  think that  is  the whole  story.  The AAMA reportedtheir captive  members  are now financing only 15  percent  of  their  totalsales.Fully 30  percent  of  sales--I guess  we call  them  sales--arenow leases.  In  addition,  that 30  percent  tends  to  be heavily weightedtoward higher-priced cars.  The  economics  of  the  auto  leasing industryis  interesting.  From the  point of  view of  consumer debt,  it  shouldmake our view of  the household situation even more  troubling.  Autoleases  are not  in  the debt numbers  or  in the  debt-service numbers.But  in  fact,  they are  really the  worst type  of  debt  service  sincethere is  absolutely no  equity buildup  in the payment.  I have gottendeeper  into  this  area than  I ever dreamed, thanks  to  our  current workon Regulation M.  Those efforts have  indicated  to me  that we  actuallyface another macroeconomic problem  from leasing, which I thought  itwas  important  to  share.  The  auto  companies  currently  are  tending  tooffer high residual-value  option prices  on  their cars.  They know  thiswill  mean that  fewer consumers will  end up buying the  leased vehiclewhen  the  lease  is  up.  The  reason  for this  practice is  that  it  tendsto make the  lease more attractive  to  current buyers because  it  lowersthe monthly payment.  And given  the high sticker price of  autos,  thisis viewed as  a necessary sales  incentive.  The  auto  companies  arewilling to  do  this because  they are making an  implicit bet  on  theability of  their  cars  to  hold up  in value  for  longer periods.  Now,this  is  not  an altogether bad bet.  Auto quality and durability areup.  But higher prices  in  the  future  for used cars  depend  in part  onprospectively higher new car prices.  For this  to  work, new car pricesmust  therefore continue  to  rise  faster  than  family incomes,  makingthem ever  less  affordable and requiring continuing  innovation  in  thefinancing areas  in  order  to keep  sales  up.  The  auto companies  are nowrecognizing,  or  at  least  their  finance divisions are now recognizing,that  they are on  a credit-based merry-go-round of  their making thatmust eventually  stop.  But  at  the present  time,  none  of  them canafford to  get  off.Future credit problems also  are apparent  in  the  trend in  homemortgage financing.  According  to  the  Federal Housing Finance Board,45  percent of  all mortgage loans  granted  in May had loan-to-valueratios  (LTVs) in  excess of  80  percent.  Some  26 percent  had LTVs  inexcess  of  90  percent.  The  average  LTV on all  30-year  fixed, non-jumboloans  was  over  82  percent.  Also,  it  is  not the  S&Ls,  the  traditionaland well-qualified source  of mortgage  funds,  that  are making  the  bulkof  these  loans.  Mortgage  companies  and commercial  banks had 28percent  of  their  originations  in over  90  percent  loan-to-value7/2-3/96-33-mortgages  versus  just  18  percent  for  the  S&Ls.  Now, from myexperience at Neighborhood Reinvestment  and  from the  studies done hereat  the  Board, it  is  clear  that  high LTVs  are a big risk  for  futuredelinquency.  No  one purchases  a home  expecting  to default,  but wheneconomic  distress occurs,  individuals with no  equity in  their homeshave  less incentive  to  stay than  those who have such  equity.  Ourexperience  shows  these high LTV loans  can be  successfully andprofitably made, but  they require enormous  amounts  of handholding andfollow-through with the borrower.  While  there  are firms  with staffcapable of  doing  this,  the  personnel  infrastructure  in the  country issimply not  adequate to  do  an  effective job at  anything approaching thecurrent  volume.  The problems here are already  showing up  and aregoing to  get worse.  Although, as Mike Prell  pointed out,  60-daydelinquency rates  on mortgages  are  still  fairly modest  in  theaggregate,  the  same  is  not  true for  those  loans  that  are  targeted topopulations likely  to get  into  trouble.  For  example, FHA 60-daydelinquencies  hit  2.83 percent  in  the  first  quarter of  this  year.That  is  a new record, and the worst  is  yet to  come.  Delinquencies  andforeclosures  tend  to peak a few years  after the mortgages  areoriginated.  Mortgage  lenders were particularly aggressive in  thistype  of  lending during 1994  and 1995,  in large part because  ofimpending  CRA reform and other  regulatory jawboning.Why care?  I think there  is  a long-term  social  cost we  aregoing to  pay from  all this,  but my Calvinist  instincts  should not haveany bearing on  your decision.  More  topically, I do not believe  thatthese  issues  are of  the  type  or magnitude  that will  affect  theintegrity of  the  banking system.  The banks are well  reserved for anyreasonably expected losses  and increasing portions  of  their mortgageportfolios are being  securitized.  But  from a timing point  of view,the  increased availability of  credit has  allowed this  expansion  tocontinue  longer than  it  otherwise would.  Consumption has  expandedmore  quickly  than  the income  of  the great majority of  Americanhouseholds.  This has  not proved troublesome  for the  expansion becausethese households  took on  increasing amounts of  debt.  I admit tohaving been surprised  that  this  has  gone on  for  such a long  time and Iam now convinced that  it  can go  on  so  long as  lenders remain willingto  extend the terms  and conditions  under which they make loans.  Butthe  price we are paying  is  the  increasing  fragility of  the  underlyingfinancial  structure  of  the household sector.  While  increasing debtburdens will  not  of  themselves  end the  expansion,  they do make  theeconomy more  susceptible  to unforeseen developments.  The nextrecession will be  longer and deeper  than  it  otherwise  would have  beenbecause  of  this  extra  debt.  Our memories  of  1991  and particularly1992  should be  fresh enough  to remind us  of  what  balance  sheetproblems  in a significant  sector of  the  economy can do  tomacroeconomic performance.At the  same time,  I do  not believe  that  a sudden burst  ofaggregate  demand is  likely, given  these  conditions.  As  long as  thereal  incomes  of  the  great majority of American households  remainstagnant,  borrowers  and lenders would have  to take  complete  leave  oftheir  senses  to  finance an  accelerated consumption binge.  It  would beone  thing to  go deeper  in debt;  it  is  another to  go  deeper  in debt  atan  ever  accelerating rate.  I am also  concerned that  thecomputerization  of  the  credit-granting decision is  going to  acceleratethe  speed with which any adverse economic  shock  is  transmitted to  andthroughout  the  household sector.  Aside from  lowering  the  cost  of7/2-3/96-34-credit decisions,  credit scoring  also makes  it  easier  to reviewexisting credit  files.  In  the present upturn,  this  has meant  fastergranting of  increased credit  lines  on  credit cards and easier  termsfor  auto  loans  and mortgages.  In  the future  downturn, it  will  meanjust the  opposite.  The  normal  decision lags  in  the process will befar  shorter next  time,  and thus  the  time  available for  the  shock towork itself  out before  it becomes  self-reinforcing will be reduced.From a policy perspective,  this  is  the real  meaning of  the  termfragility with respect  to  the economy;  and all we  can do  is watch andwait.

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At  the  last meeting,  Iobserved that  I thought we  were  entering a watershed period.  Ibelieve  that  we are now in  that period, although I think it  is  tooearly to  tell  just which way the water  is  going  to  fall  when it  falls.Certainly at  this  time, we  have an  economy with a good head of  steam.Many have  remarked on that.  And we could be  looking at a pickup  ofinflation;  that prospect could certainly raise its head.  If  we  areconvinced that the  likely scenario  is  intensifying  inflation  and thatit  is  baked  in  the  cake, then  I think it  is  time  for action.  It  isbetter to  adjust  policy sooner  rather than  later,  once we believethat.  But  I still  must question whether  or not  that  is  the  case.  Ifwe  look at  the past  four quarters  including the  second  quarter andassume  4 percent growth for  the  second quarter,  four-quarter GDPgrowth would be  a little over  2.5  percent.  Over most  of  this pastperiod, many observers here  and elsewhere  have believed that  theeconomy was  at  capacity;  we  started  talking  about  that  some  time  ago.And yet where are  we?  Most of  our  inflation  measures--the  core CPI,the core  PPI,  and the GDP deflator--are  flat  on  a rate-of-change basisor  else the  rate of  change  is beginning to  drift down  in some  cases.Foreign  inflation  is  half  that  in  the United States.  Unit  labor costscurrently are rising  at  a rate  of  around  2.3 percent, and  they havebeen decelerating  over  the course of  this  four-quarter period.  Thecapacity utilization rate has been  flat  at  about 82  percent.Unemployment  has been flat  at  5.5  or  5.55 percent;  there are  two  5.6sin  there.  Commodity prices  are now falling  almost across  the  board,including virtually all  industrial  commodities,  gold, oil,  and even alarge number of  foodstuffs.I think the  third quarter may be a time when we will  get areading  on  the watershed.  When we are  talking about  a four-quarterchange,  folding  in one  quarter  forward could make a lot  of  difference.If  the  third-quarter  growth rate is  going  to be another  4 percent orso,  then  the  four-quarter  rate  of  change will  accelerate to  about 2.7percent.  If  the  growth rate  is  going  to  fall back  to  2.5  percent,which  is  still  above  the  Greenbook forecast, we  would then  be  talkingabout a four-quarter  rate  of  change  falling back to  2.4  percent  and wewould have  a declining  trend.  So,  the  current  quarter will  make a lotof  difference in  terms  of  judging  the trend.If  we look  at  the Greenbook  for  the  rest  of  the  forecastperiod of  six quarters  out,  as  Mike  Prell noted  the  staff hasprojected a trend rate  of  growth of  about  2.2  percent, a flatunemployment  rate  at  5.5  percent, a flat  capacity utilization rate,unit  labor costs  rising at  a 2.5  percent rate without  much trend, and7/2-3/96-35-no  acceleration in  the  growth of  activity over  the  course of  that  six-quarter period.  One  certainly can  argue that  that  may be too  modest aforecast  on  the  output  side and  that  the  rate  of  inflation may riseduring that  forecast period.  That  is  the  risk.  We  have had a veryfickle expansion  for  20  quarters  or so now.  The  rate  of economicgrowth has  changed its  direction  something like  11  times in  those  20quarters,  so  the rate  of  expansion has  repeatedly sped up  and sloweddown.  Even if  the risk  is  to  the up  side,  it  may not be that  great arisk.  If  we  look at  the  last  two years  and where we  are  today, andparticularly  if we  focus  on the  last year  to  date,  it  is hard togenerate much conviction  out  of  that experience  that  we necessarilyare going  to  see any  inflation impulse  at all,  given  economic  growthin  line with  the Greenbook  forecast.  Certainly we  could, but  it  seemsto  me that  if  the  economy runs  a course similar  to  that  over  the pastyear or  two, at  the worst increased  inflation will be  rather slow tomaterialize and will  not have very much muscle behind it.  So,  thereis  some chance in my opinion  that we may be able  to  continue to  ridethe  crest  of  this really remarkable period for  some  time  to  come.Beyond that,  who is  to  say which way the water is  going to  flow?Mr. Chairman,  the  tale is  not  yet  told in my view.  I doagree that  the  risks  are on the  up side,  and  as  a consequence  I amsitting very lightly in my chair.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  The moderate growthstory that we have been  talking about certainly  seems  to  be playingout.  The  second-quarter information  looks  generally strong, andindeed most  of  the members  around  the  table have  ratcheted up theirgrowth projections.  The  difficult  question before  us  is  to  whatextent  the  slowdown that  is  projected in the  Greenbook willmaterialize.  A turn  in direction is  the most  difficult  thing  toproject, and  I suspect  that may be why we are  getting some  differencesaround the  table  in our  forecasts.  There  clearly are  some goodarguments  for a slowdown.  Higher bond rates certainly should affectinterest-sensitive  sectors of  the  economy.  Housing  is  showing somesigns of  a pause.  The  slowdown  in business  fixed  investment seems  todepend on people's expectations  of  slower growth  in  final  sales,including  the  notion that we have  run through pent-up demand.Consumer spending has been  a consistent  source of  strength, one  thathas  been  financed by  increased consumer debt  as Governor Lindsey hasjust  documented for us.  So,  I think  that consumer spending will  atbest  only track  increases  in  income, which again supports  the  argumentof  a slowdown.  The notion  that job  insecurity stemming  fromdownsizings  and improvements  in  technology continues  to  generatesubstantial  uncertainty is  another  factor that  should help to  slow thegrowth in  consumer spending.I do have to  say that  a slowdown  in  the  second half  is  not asure thing.  We  have been  saying,  for  example,  that  business  fixedinvestment would slow  in  1996,  but  so  far we have  clocked in  a double-digit rate  of  increase.  Although interest rates  are  up from  theirlows,  the overall  cost of  capital  is  fairly reasonable.  The  cost  ofequity capital  is  really quite  favorable.  The  term  structure ofinterest rates  is  fairly healthy in  terms  of both  the  overall  leveland the  slope  of  the yield curve.  Various  types  of  risk  managementtools  and new financial  instruments  are  allowing businesses and7/2-3/96-36-households  to  time-adjust  their expenditures  and  their commitmentpatterns.  I think that  this  is  adding to  the  difficulty of projectinga slowdown.  Another reason why a slowdown is  not necessarily a surething is  that wealth effects may encourage  consumers and businesses tocontinue  to  spend and invest.  As  long  as  we have unemployment in  the5.4  to  5.6 percent  range, people are working and  they are  likely tocontinue  to  spend.  So,  it  is  hard to  argue  that  there will  be  a bigpullback in consumption.  The  industrial  sector  is  showing  somestrength.  We do  not  have major economic  imbalances to work through interms  of  inventories, which are  relatively well  aligned with  sales.Business balance  sheets  have been improved in many cases.  Capital  andbanking markets are well positioned to  support  increased growth.There  has certainly been progress  on  the  Federal  deficit,  at  least  inthe  short  run.Turning  for  a moment  to  inflation,  as measured by the  CPI  itclearly  has accelerated in  early 1996,  but  if we  take a longer  look atsome  of  the  broader  statistics,  we are  getting very mixed  signals.  Iwas particularly  impressed by one  of  the  tables  in  the Greenbookshowing changes  from  12  months  earlier  for  a whole  series ofindicators  for  the period ended in May.  Comparing  the year ended May1995  to  the  year ended May 1996,  there  actually have been  improvementsin the  CPI,  core  CPI,  core  PPI,  intermediate PPI,  core  intermediatePPI,  and core  crude materials.  The only major indexes  that  did notimprove are  the  PPI  and its  crude materials component,  and the  reasonsthere  are the  oil and food  stories.  But  crude materials excludingfood and energy  are down  12-1/2 percent  for  the year to  date,  andother  commodity price measures also  are down.  I would not  haveexpected  to  see  an  improvement  in  inflation given  the fact  that wehave seen  a fairly strong  economic performance this year.Looking  forward  as opposed  to  looking back at  the  last  12months,  the  inflation  risk from the  energy sector  that we cited  in Mayseems  to  have  abated and energy prices  appear  to be  coming down.  Butwhile  the  risk from energy  appears  to have  lessened, the risk  fromrising  food prices  remains.  We  have come  far  enough along  in  theplanting  season that  the  chances  of  a disastrous harvest  havediminished, but we  still  are at  some risk  in  the  food  area.  Wages areanother  area at  risk, given the outlook  for a hike  in the minimumwage,  reports  of  scattered labor  shortages,  and the ECI  surge  that wesaw  for  the  first  quarter  of  this  year.  The  federal  deficit  situationremains  a problem for  the  long  term, and we  need to  make  some progresson  that.  So,  the risk of  rising  inflation  is definitely present.Even so,  I think there is  some room  for  optimism.  There has been somediscussion around the  table about  productivity.  Are we measuringproductivity  in  services  correctly?  Are we measuring the productivitygains  from  technology accurately?  We  also have had an expansion  incapacity over  the  last  few years that  should  help in  terms  ofmoderating  cost pressures.  In  addition, I believe  that inflationpsychology has  lessened somewhat.  So,  there  is  some  room  for  optimismon  the  inflation  side,  but there  is  certainly continued risk.In  sum,  I think  the economy  is  doing quite well,  and  thestrength is  all  the  more  impressive because we  have  seen  improvementin  inflation.  But the risk to  the  expansion does  seem to me  to  haveshifted to  the up  side.  To the  extent that  we have  a second-halfslowdown,  it may well  be  fairly  shallow.7/2-3/96-37-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will  try to  be briefbecause,  like  President Broaddus,  I would like  to  take  a little  extratime  in our next  go-around concerning price  objectives  for monetarypolicy.The  key questions  today are  identical  to  those  at  our  lastmeeting.  Will  aggregate demand really moderate  in  the  second half  ofthe year, and are we  about  to  see  an  uptick in core  inflation  due  toincreasing wage pressures  in already tight  labor markets  and thefeedback of  higher food prices  into wage demands?  With respect  to  theslowdown  in aggregate demand, I confess both ignorance  and concern.  Iagree with  the Greenbook  that  aggregate  demand will probably slowtoward  trend, for all  of  the  reasons  that  are by now familiar, andwill  probably do  so with the  usual  long  and variable  lags.  Higherinterest  rates  and a somewhat  stronger  dollar will  eventually takesome  toll  on housing,  associated consumer durables,  and net  exports.The  influence on growth  of  inherently transitory factors  like  therebuilding of  auto  inventories will  soon wane, and the data  alreadypoint  to  a slowing pace  of  noncomputer investment  spending,  consistentwith predictions  of  the  accelerator.  But  I admit  there  is  only scantyevidence  that housing markets  are poised to  cool.  Computer investmentwith  the Greenbook  that with  leaner  inventories,  a surge  in  inventoryinvestment  is possible  and poses  upside risks.  If  final  demand growthproves  significantly  stronger  than was  anticipated, inventoryinvestment  could again  increase,  touching off  a new round  in  theinventory  cycle.  The  risks here  seem weighted toward  the  up  side.With respect to  inflation,  though, as  a number  of  you haveemphasized, the news  has  been favorable.  Core  inflation  in  the CPIand PPI  remains well  contained  and, as  the  Roberts memo  and theChairman highlighted, consumer  inflation as measured by  the  chain-weighted PCE  is  running  just over  2 percent.  I would emphasize  thatour most recent readings  on  long-term  inflationary expectations  alsoare  quite positive, suggesting the  absence of  any deterioration there.Food prices  do seem poised to  rise, with pass-through  to wages  andcore  inflation  a possibility.  But  eventually, even  if  it  is  beyondour  forecast horizon, it  seems  to  me  that these  weather-related pricehikes will unwind, bringing core  inflation back down,  too.  In myopinion,  temporary  supply shocks  should be  essentially  irrelevant  tomonetary policy.At  the  same  time,  labor markets  do seem  tight,  although theyare no  tighter now than  they have been  for most  of  the  last  two years.Several  of  us  commented at  our  last meeting, and a number  of  youfocused on  this  today,  that  there  are  several  aspects  of  labor marketbehavior that  are puzzling.  Increases  in  compensation are runningsignificantly below what  our models would predict.  Core  inflationstill  exceeds the pace  consistent with the  apparent  trend in  unitlabor  costs,  and profit margins have widened.  In my estimation,  theentire pattern of  surprises  that we are  seeing is  exactly consistentwith what  one would expect to  see  as  a result of  a structural  changethat  has a negative  impact  on  the bargaining power  of workers.  Such  ashift might result  from an  increased  sense  of  job  insecurity relatedto  technological change or  corporate restructuring  as  the Chairman hasemphasized.  It  could be  due to  factors  raising workers' perceptions7/2-3/96-38-of  the  likely cost  of  job  loss.  It  could be  due  to  improvements  inthe  ability of  firms  to  outsource  either domestically orinternationally because this  poses  a threat  to  the bargaining power ofworkers.  It  could be  due  to  an  increased prevalence of more  flexiblepay-for-performance arrangements.We  often remind  ourselves  that  the  natural  rate  is not  atime-invariant constant.  But  it  is  structural shifts  like  the  ones  Ihave mentioned  that  in modern theories  of  the  labor market would  shiftthe  natural  rate  of  unemployment and result  in a persistent,  not  justa very transitory, decline  in the natural  rate.  The  unfortunate  thingis  that  the  hypothesis  that  the  natural  rate  has  declined  for  these  orfor other  reasons  remains  just  that.  It  is  a hypothesis,  and it  canonly be  confirmed with an accumulation of  data  and the passage  oftime.  The  staff,  I believe, is  properly skeptical.  We  may be  livingon borrowed time,  and  there may end up being  a price  to pay for havingallowed the  economy, to use  Governor Lindsey's  phrase,  "to push theenvelope."  In my estimation,  though, with  each passing quarter--and  Inow count  seven--in which unemployment  remains  near 5-1/2  percent  andcore  inflation declines  or  remains  stable,  the  Committee's degree  ofconfidence  that  the natural  rate has  fallen should rise a little.Mine  certainly has.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We welcome you.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you.  It  is nice  to  begin by  finding myselfin  such  strong agreement with  the  staff  forecast, both  in  anticipationof  a slowing  toward trend immediately ahead and in appreciating upsiderisks  in the  current environment.  Now  this  agreement is  both pleasingand disappointing  at the  same  time.  I am pleased on the  one hand tofind  that  the approach and the  judgment  of  the  staff  is  so  similar  tomine and, in  that  respect,  it  feels  like home.  On  the other hand, Ihave  to  admit  that  this robs  me of  some potential value-added that  Imight otherwise  bring to  this  group.I want to  focus my remarks  on what I view as  the  two keyissues  in  the  forecast  in relation to  the decision  that  is  before  us.If  it  sounds  like  there  is  an  echo  in  this  room,  it  is  really my faultfor  allowing Governor Yellen  to  slip  her remarks  in before mine!  Thefirst  issue  is,  is  growth  likely to  remain above trend?  If  so,  thengiven  the  already high levels  of  resource utilization, we willcertainly have to  tighten  sooner rather  than  later.  Second, even ifgrowth quickly returns  to  trend and the  unemployment  rate  stabilizesat  the prevailing level  as  in the  staff  forecast,  are utilizationrates  already  so  high as  to  make  a gradual  increase  in  inflationinevitable?  If  we are  going to  reach  this  conclusion, a tighterpolicy would also be called  for,  though the  small  gap  implied by  thestaff  forecast makes  such  a move  less  urgent  than  in  the  case ofpersistent,  above-trend growth.  I want to  comment  a little  further oneach  of  these  two points.7/2-3/96-39-First, with  regard to  a slowdown toward  trend, I expect theeconomy grew at  a rate  of  about 4 to  4-1/2  percent in  the  secondquarter.  If  the  staff  forecast  is  correct  and if  mine  is  correct,this will  be  the  only quarter  during  the  year when growth  issignificantly above  trend, and  it  will  follow a year when growth wasjob of  putting that  in historical  perspective by looking  at  four-quarter growth rates.  That  would produce  growth for  the year  of  about2.7  percent  on  a fourth-quarter to  fourth-quarter basis, but  I amlooking  for a growth rate  of  2 to 2-1/4  percent both in  the  secondhalf  of  1996  and over  1997.Now, why do  I think  the  expansion  is  likely to  slow?  As hasbeen well  documented, part  of  the  largess  in the  second quarter  is  dueto  special  factors,  including  the end of  the  first-quarter GM strike,reversal of  the effects  of  the  government shutdown and a rebound fromadverse weather.  Of  course,  these  special  factors  have  just  shiftedgrowth between the  first  and the  second quarters,  and they do not  takeaway the  fact  that  the expansion  accelerated to  a rate of  about 3percent  over  the  first  half of  the  year.  Still,  the  strength  nowapparent  in the  second quarter  overstates significantly  thesustainable momentum in  the  economy going  forward.  I expect  thatfinal  sales  actually will  have  slowed  in  the  second quarter  and thatthe  inventory investment  that was  such a powerful  contributor in  thesecond quarter will provide  a declining contribution to  output  growthin  coming quarters,  setting  the  stage  for trend  growth.  The projectedslowdown  in final  sales  is  suggested by both the  rebound in  long-terminterest  rates  this year  and the  appreciation of  the  dollar.  It  isconsistent with at  least  some hints about  what is  going on  in  some  keysectors.  There  is  no  question that  housing has been a lot  strongerthan  I expected  in  the  first half,  but  I believe  that  the  decline  inhousing  starts  we  saw in May is  the beginning of  a gradual  erosion  ofstrength  in  the  sector  largely due  to  the rebound in  long-term rates.Contract data  suggest  that nonresidential  construction activity isalso  on  a slowing path.  There  appears  to be very  little  life  left  inequipment spending other  than computers,  reflecting a combination  ofaccelerator and cash  flow effects.  Having said that,  I can see  theupside  risk in  this  environment  and I will  say here  that  if  it  were  topersist  and the  economy were  to  be a lot  stronger, I would not have  tobe  dragged kicking and screaming  into  another view of monetary policy.Let  me talk  about  the uncertainty, which  I think  is  alsoimportant, about  the  implications  of  current utilization rates.Utilization rates have  eased  in  manufacturing since the  cyclical peaksin late  1994  and early 1995  and have  remained nearly constant  foralmost  the  last two years  in  the  case  of  the  labor market.  Theunemployment  rate  is  admittedly below the staff  estimate of  NAIRU,which in turn  is virtually identical  to  my own point  estimate.However,  there  is  no broad-based evidence of  a demand-inducedacceleration of  inflation despite  the persistence of  a lowunemployment rate  for nearly two  years.  Indeed, core  measures  ofinflation  for both the CPI  and the  PPI  actually have moved lower thisyear.  So  for my part,  if  there  is  any surprise about  inflation,  it  ishow well  contained  it  is  rather  than how high it  is.  The staffcontinues  to project, based on  the  unemployment gap, a gradualacceleration of  inflation pressures  in  coming quarters.  But  there  iscertainly some hint  in  the  recent  data  of  a change  in  the  fundamentalsgoverning the  wage-price process.  In the  current context,  I wonder  if7/2-3/96-40-it would not be useful  to  think  of  NAIRU more  as  a range  than as  apoint--say, 5-1/2  to  6 percent.  If  the  unemployment rate  remainswithin this  range,  then  there  is no  case  for  intervening.  As  theunemployment  rate moves  toward the  bottom end, then  we  should becomeincreasingly  alert  to  the  potential need for  a tighter policy butaction  should be postponed until  the  rate moves  outside  this  range.Now, we  seem to have a pattern where we  see  scattered evidence  of wagepressures but  little evidence of  price pressures,  and  I wonder whetheror  not what we  are  seeing is  some reversal  of  the pattern  of wideningprofit margins  that  occurs  early during  a recovery when wages  lagprice  inflation.  If  so,  we can  accommodate  the  somewhat  faster wagegains  without  having  them pass  forward  in the  form of  higherinflation.I also want to  say a few words  about  special-factorinflation, which clearly has boosted inflation  so  far  this year.  I amleery of  supporting what  I might call  "counter-weather,"  as  opposed tocountercyclical  monetary policy that would seek a tighter policy tooffset  the  temporary blip in  food prices  that has not yet  evenarrived.  In  addition,  I have  some  strong priors  favoring  a sharpprices  are going  to  be  below the  staff  forecast  in  1997.In  summary, I expect  growth to  slow  to  trend in time  toprevent  the  unemployment rate  from moving below  the narrow range  thathas prevailed over the  last two years.  The current  level  of  theunemployment  rate  is  not definitively below NAIRU.  I am happy withthe  current  environment.  Thank you.

MS.  RIVLIN.  I have  been on  the  job  exactly five days,  so  Iam not  going  to  say  a great deal,  in part for  that reason and  in partbecause an  awful  lot  has  already been said with which  I agree.  But  Ithink you will  have  to  admit  that  Larry and I chose  a remarkably goodtime  to  join  the Federal Reserve and  the FOMC.  This  is  the mostfavorable  set  of  economic  statistics  and projections  that  I canremember and  that  I think most people around  the table  can remember.To have healthy growth and no  clear sign of  inflation  is  quiteremarkable,  and as  I listened to  the  comments  around  the  tableeverybody seemed to  be  straining to  explain to  themselves  and  to  eachother why it  is  so  good when we  all  thought  that  this probably couldnot  really happen.  My own views  fit very closely with the projectionin  the  Greenbook.  That  is  partly because  the Administration  fromwhich  I am  a recent refugee has  a forecast  that  is  very similar  to  theone  in the  Greenbook.  When the Administration is  so  close to  theFederal  Reserve,  everybody  ought  to be reassured that  there  isn't somekind  of hanky-panky going on!To draw on my recent  area  of  so-called expertise,  I do  findthe  Fed staff  a little pessimistic  about  the  outlook for the  federaldeficit  in  1997.  The  1996  deficit  is  certainly going  to be betterthan anybody predicted.  The  $125  to  $130 billion  range now  looks goodto  everyone.  The 1997  deficit will  certainly be  higher, but  I thinkit  is  unlikely to be  as much higher as  the  Fed  staff projects;  theyhave  a $163  billion deficit.  I think  it  is  very possible  that  we willget  a major new effort at  deficit reduction, if  not before  theelection certainly shortly after  it,  no matter who wins.  That  might7/2-3/96-41-not be  soon enough  to  affect  fiscal  year  1997  very much, but  it  couldhave a strong effect  in demonstrating  the outlook  for  decliningoutyear  deficits, which  the markets  certainly would view as  afavorable thing.  Besides  that,  I am  simply in  the  same place as mycolleagues.  Everything depends  on whether this  slowdown in  the  secondhalf  of  the  year actually materializes.  The  recent statistics  do  notshow that yet,  clearly, and the upside  risk is  certainly  there.  Butit  is  impressive how difficult  it  is  to  find  any real  evidence,  eitherstatistical or  even  anecdotal,  that  there  are  strong wage pressures  oreven more  so  that  there are upward movements  in  prices.  Indeed,  asseveral people  have noted,  the  general  inflation trend has been  down.So,  I will  watch with eagerness as  this  story unfolds  over  the  nextfew months.  I just do not  think we  know yet whether  the  good news  canhold or whether we  are  in  for some unpleasant  shocks.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you all.  Shall  we adjourn  forcoffee?  When we come back, we  can talk  about  long-term  inflation.[Coffee  break]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The next  item on  our agenda--the  issueof  long-term  inflation goals--is  something that we have beendiscussing on  and off  for  a long while,  and I think we will  continueto do  so.  It  is  important  that we move  forward on  this  issue  and morespecifically that we agree  on what  the  goals mean before we  can  findsome  consensus within the  Committee regarding  their  implementation.As  background for  today's discussion,  Dave  Stockton wrote what  I feltwas  an  exceptionally interesting memorandum and raised a number ofwhat  I believe  are relevant  issues.  Basically, I think what we haveto  confront  is  a number of  specific issues  that we have  never reallyfocused on.When we  talk about price stability  as  a goal,  setting asidethe measurement problem, are we talking about price stability  or arewe  talking about  zero  inflation?  As  we all  know, those are  twooccurs, we would forgive past mistakes  or changes  on  either side  ofprice  stability.  But  if  the  objective  is  to maintain price  stability,a deviation  implies  action to  reverse the  changes.  We  also might havesome  other  approach that  is  a variation of  the  two.  This  organizationhas  become increasingly  involved in  analyzing  the  question of  the wagecompression  that  occurs when inflation moves  toward zero  and wagesmove  down  sharply.  Does  the  issue of  nominal  versus real wages  make  asignificant difference  as  to  how the economy  functions?  Within  theBoard, I think we  have  a wonderful  argument brewing.  The  issue  alsooccurs with nominal  interest  rates and  their downside  limit.  There  isalso  the much broader  question of  transition costs and benefits,  allof  which relate to  how we  approach this  issue.  It  is  a simple matterto  state  that we will  have such  and such  a goal,  but  it  is  verydifficult  to get  this  Committee--comprised not  of  12  but  of  19individuals who  are relevant  in regard  to  this  issue--to agree  on  somesimple standard without a really  fundamental  agreement on what  it  iswe  are talking  about when we have such  a stated goal.  That  is  as  muchas  I am  going to say  on  this  issue at  the  moment.  We have  twodiscussants  requesting to be recognized, and we will  go  first  to  Dr.Yellen and then  to  Dr. Broaddus.7/2-3/96-42-

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I will  apologize  in  advance, since my commentsare a little  on the  long  side.  I would like  to begin by summarizingmy views  and  then run through  a mini  cost-benefit  analysis  of  thewelfare consequences  of  a permanent reduction  in  inflation.  Topreview my conclusions,  I think we  should move  to  lower  inflation butgingerly, because we really do  not  know how large  the permanent costsmight be  in  the  form of  higher unemployment, and we  should  find out bytesting  the waters,  studying the results,  and rethinking  furtherinitiatives  if  the  costs  turn  out  to  be  too  large.The  experience of  our  northern neighbor  should serve  as  awarning  to us  to move  slowly.  The  Canadian economy usually tracks  theU.S.  economy  fairly closely.  Recently,  though,  Canada has  pursued andachieved very low  inflation  targets,  but  its  real  economic performancerelative  to  the U.S. economy has been very poor.  The divergencebetween  the  two economies  in the  1980s was  likely due  to  differencesin the  U.S.  and Canadian treatment  of unemployment  insurance, but  therestrictive monetary policy targets  that have  achieved the  lower  endof  the  Canadian target  range of  1 to  3 percent  inflation.  Since mid-1992,  the  Canadian unemployment  rate has  averaged  10.5 percent, 3percentage points  above the  estimated Canadian NAIRU, while coreinflation has  remained virtually stable  instead  of  decelerating the6 percentage points--to negative  4.5  percent by mid-1996--that wouldhave been predicted by  the  usual  Canadian Phillips  curve  relationship.That  suggests  a long-run Phillips  curve  that  is  quite flat  in theneighborhood of  zero  inflation.To perform the  relevant  cost-benefit  calculation of  lowerinflation  in  the  United States, we need  to measure  both the  transitorycosts  involved in moving from where we  are to  our ultimate  inflationtarget  and then any permanent  costs  and benefits  associated withdifferent  steady-state inflation  rates.  I would like  to  start withthe  easy part,  the  short-run costs because here  I think  the  literatureis  clear  and we  can narrow down the  range.  The  sacrifice  ratio in  ournew FRB-US model  without credibility  effects  is  2.5,  resulting  in anoutput cost  of  about  5 percent  of  GDP per point of  inflation.  Inprinciple, credibility effects  could lower the  sacrifice ratio, butboth  international  cross-section evidence and time  series  evidence  forvarious  countries provide no  support  for  a credibility effect, and Iagree with David Stockton's  conclusion  that  "empirical evidence ofcredibility effects  of  announced  inflation targets  is  difficult tofind."So much  for  the  range  of  short-run costs.  Now, to make itworthwhile  to bear an  output  cost  in  Dave Stockton's range  of  3 to  6percent  of  GDP per point of  inflation reduction,  the permanent netbenefits would have  to  be  substantial,  although any benefits  that  aredependent  on  GDP will  grow over  time.  If we  think of  the  short-runcosts  as a risky investment, we would need to  earn a pretax return ona par with  alternative uses  of  funds.  If  we assume  a 6 percentrequired  rate of  return and 2 percent growth  in real  GDP,  we wouldrequire an  expected permanent net benefit  somewhere  in  the range  of  abit over  .1 to  .25 percent of  GDP--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Excuse me,  that  6 percent is  realinterest  rates?7/2-3/96-43-

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Right.  If  you like,  you can  vary theassumptions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  it's  just  that you did not  specify.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  I'm sorry;  I am thinking of  real  rates.  So  onewould need a little over  1/10 percent  to  about  1/4  percent  of GDP  as  anet gain per point of  inflation reduction  to  justify that  type  ofinvestment.  The question is,  from whence might  such benefits accrue?In the  interest  of  time,  I want  to  focus  on  only the  things  I considermaj or.The only identifiable benefit  of  low inflation that  I thinkcould be big enough to  create the needed payoff  is  connected with  thetax  system and  its  interaction with inflation.  The  most  importantrecent study is  that  of Martin  Feldstein, and it  shows  that  thebenefits  in question are positive and large,  contrary to most people'sintuition.  Feldstein  calculates  that  the benefits  due  to  lower  taxdistortions  from a 2 percentage point  reduction in  inflation under hisbaseline assumptions amount  to  1 percent of  GDP.  The  lion's  share  ofthat gain,  .92  percentage point,  accrues  from reducing the  deadweightloss  associated with distortions  in  the  timing  of  consumption over  thetypical  saver's  lifetime.  But Feldstein's  calculation relies not  onlyon  the  assumption of a moderate positive  interest elasticity ofsavings  demand but also  on  the,  to me dubious,  assumptions  that  first,most  saving is  for retirement  and second, that  there are no  tax-sheltered retirement  savings vehicles.  Feldstein's  calculations  omitthe many ways under existing tax  codes  that  savers can  and do  shelterincome  on retirement  savings,  including pension plans,  tax-deferredsavings plans,  and annuities.  This  suggests  to me  that  Feldstein'snumber  could be  off  by an order  of magnitude.  I would add thatdespite  the  technical  difficulties in rewriting the  tax code,  thesegains  could be  achieved at  far  lower  cost  simply  through  legislation.Now, I think  there are  likely to  be  significant, permanentcosts  of very low  inflation, and David Stockton pinpointed themaccurately.  First,  a little  inflation permits  real  interest  rates  tobecome negative on  the  rare  occasions when  required to  counter arecession.  This  could be  important,  and I think the  current  situationin Japan provides a textbook example  of  the  difficulties  instimulating an  economy that  is  experiencing deflation.  Even withnominal  short-term rates  at  .5 percent, real  short-term rates  cannotfall  into  the needed negative territory.Second, and to my mind the  most  important argument for  somelow inflation rate,  is  the  "greasing-the-wheels argument"  on  thegrounds  that  a little  inflation  lowers unemployment by facilitatingadjustments  in  relative pay in  a world where individuals  deeplydislike  nominal pay cuts.  With some permanent aversion  to  nominal paycuts,  the  output  and unemployment costs  of  lowering inflation  that weordinarily think of  as  transitory simply never disappear because thelong-run Phillips  curve becomes  negatively sloping as  inflationapproaches  zero.  This  is  arguably the recent Canadian experience.  Arecent paper by George Akerlof, Bill  Dickens,  and George  Perry, forth-coming  in Brookings  Papers,  shows  through simulation experiments  thefrequency with which nominal  wage cuts would be  required to  avoidpermanently higher aggregate unemployment  as  American inflation  fallstoward measured zero under realistic  assumptions  about  the variability7/2-3/96-44-and serial  correlation of  demand  shocks across  firms.  The authorsassume  that  firms  experiencing  losses  can and do  cut wages after  twoyears, which  is  in  accord with existing evidence  by Blinder and Choi,Bewley and others,  and that  workers will  accept nominal wage cuts  whenthey perceive  it  as  needed and fair.  Even  so,  these  authors  find  thatthe needed  frequency  of nominal  cuts  rises  rapidly as  inflationwages  after two  years of  losses,  an additional  5 percent  of  firmswould seek to  cut  wages  at  3 percent  inflation,  10 percent  at  2percent  inflation,  19  percent at  1 percent  inflation, and 33  percentof  firms would ideally  impose wage  cuts on workers  at  zero measuredinflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  is  the productivity  growth level?

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Productivity growth  is  placed at  the  current1 percent  level.  An aversion on the  part of  firms  to  impose  thesedesired nominal  wage  cuts  results  in higher permanent  rates  ofunemployment.  As  the  numbers  I just  cited would suggest,  the  impactof  resistance to nominal  wage cuts  on permanent  unemployment  is  highlynonlinear.  It  would be barely noticeable at  present U.S.  inflationlevels.  It  is  also worth pointing out,  picking  up on  the  comment  theChairman just made,  that what matters  to permanent unemployment  is  notthe  steady state  inflation  rate per se  but  the  sum of  the  inflationand productivity growth rates, which determines  the  trend  in nominalwages.  If  we go back  to  the 1950s  and 1960s  and  ask why we had lowunemployment  with  low inflation,  I think  the answer  is  thatproductivity growth was much more rapid and that  makes a bigdifference.The key  question is  how much permanent  unemployment rises  asinflation  falls,  and here  the methodology used  to assess  theconsequences does  matter.  These  authors used general  equilibriummethodology and here  is  what  they  find:  The natural  rate  rises aboveits assumed  5.8  percent  minimum to  6.1  percent as  measured inflationfalls  from 4 down  to 2 percent;  the natural  rate  rises  to  6.5  percentat  1 percent  inflation, and  then to  7.6  percent  at  zero percentinflation.  With different methodology, the  impact  of  nominal  rigiditycould be  lower.  But  even so,  I think it  is  apparent that  an  economywhere  20  to  30  percent  of  firms  need to  impose  pay cuts  in  a typicalyear  to  operate  efficiently is  likely to  be  an economy  that will endup  functioning below its potential.The  simulations  in  this paper assume  that,  except  incircumstances where  the  firm is  really  in trouble, workers  resist andfirms  are unwilling to  impose nominal  pay cuts  for fear  of harmingworker morale and  causing productivity-reducing backlash.  In  Canadabetween  1992  and 1994  when core  inflation was under 2 percent  andunemployment  3 percent  above the  estimated NAIRU, 47  percent  of  1,149observed labor  contracts  had pay freezes but  only 6 percent had wagecuts.  The  question is,  how common  is  resistance  to nominal wage  cuts?I certainly do not have  time  to  review all  the  available  evidence, butI want  to  say that  I think we  are dealing here with  a very deep-rootedproperty of  the  human psyche that  is  uncovered repeatedly  inexperiments,  surveys,  and  interviews.  Very recently, Bob Schiller ofYale posed the  following question to a random sample of Americans.  Heasked,  "Do you agree with  the  following  statement:  I think  that  if mypay went  up, I would feel  more satisfaction in  my job,  more sense  of7/2-3/96-45-fulfillment, even  if  prices went up  just as much."  Of  hisrespondents,  28  percent  agreed  fully and another  21 percent partiallyagreed.  Only 27  percent completely disagreed, although I think itwill  comfort you to  learn that  in a special subsample  of  economists,not  one  single economist  Schiller polled fully agreed and 78  percentcompletely disagreed.  [Laughter]To  the best  of my knowledge,  the  only potential  evidence infavor of  the  proposition  that Americans will  and frequently do  acceptnominal wage cuts  without  changing jobs  comes  in  recent studies whosemethodology  I consider flawed.  These  studies use  individual  data  fromthe  Panel  Studies  on  Income Dynamics, a longitudinal study  thatfollows  individuals  over time.  To  compute the wage changes  ofemployees who remain  in  the  same  job, these various  studies  take  thedifference between wages  reported by the  same  individual  inconsecutive years.  The problem with this  approach is  that  it  is  knownthat reporting  error  in wage  levels  is  very large,  and such  errorsresult  in an  artificially high  incidence of  calculated wage  cuts.  Incommenting on  the most  recent paper of  this  sort,  by David Card andDean Hyslop,  John Shea  computed the incidence  of  reported and actualwage cuts  of  379  participants  in  the  PSID whose  occupation,  industry,and area  of  residence  enabled him to  uniquely define  the bargainingagreement covering them.  He  found that 21.1  percent  of  thoserespondents had reported wage cuts,  but  in contrast,  only  1.3  percentwere actually covered by bargaining  agreements  that  contained wagecuts.Where does  that  leave  us?  I want  to  wrap up by indicatingwhat  happens when we do  the  cost-benefit analysis by using  theAkerlof,  Dickens,  Perry estimates  of  inflation-related changes  inpermanent  unemployment along with Feldstein's  estimates  of  the  tax-related welfare benefits under his baseline and more conservativeassumptions about  the  interest  elasticity of  savings.  As  I totalthings up,  it  appears  to  me  that  a reduction  of  inflation  from  3percent, which  I take  as  roughly  our current  level,  to  2 percent, verylikely, but not  surely, yields net benefits.  The  "grease-the-wheel"argument  is  of minor  importance at  that  point,  and  tax effects  couldbe  significant.  But with  further reductions  in  inflation below 2percent,  nominal  rigidity begins  to  bite  so that  the marginal payoffmeasured inflation as  currently calculated  requires highly optimisticassumptions  about  tax benefits and the  sacrifice  ratio.  Of  course,  ifinflation  cum tax distortions  were  remedied through  legislationinstead of  Federal  Reserve policy, the  net benefits would be  lower.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Al,  may I respond to  this  just  for aminute?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Absolutely.  I do  not really have a response,just a comment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We have  an argument that  is  very wellput  together.  In  an unusual way, what you have  documented is  one ofthe necessary conditions  for price  stability, which is  acceleratedproductivity.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  I agree with that.7/2-3/96-46-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But  let  me go  further.  I must  admitthat  several  years  ago  I raised this  hypothesis with our  staffcolleagues  and had them take  a look at  what happens  to  productivity asthe  inflation rate moves  toward zero.  Lo and behold, they got  areasonably good correlation that  unfortunately disappeared to  a largeextent  when the  data were  revised.  Leaving  the statistical  testsaside, we  do  observe out  in  the world that  as  the  inflation  ratefalls,  it  becomes  increasingly difficult  for producers  to  raiseprices.  They therefore  tend to  try  to  reduce  costs  in order  tomaintain margins.  We have  seen  that  as  a generic  observation.  Weknow that  if  everyone  does  it,  since on  a consolidated basis  65  to  70percent  of  the  cost  structure  is  labor manhours,  of  necessity we willtend  to  get  an  increase  in productivity because  it  is  being  forced onthe  system by the  downward compression.  If  that  is  the way the  systemfunctions, then we  can turn  the  analysis on  its head and raise  thequestion of what  type  of  productivity increases  are required  tomaintain nominal  wage  level  distributions  in which the  compressiondoes not  occur and all  of  the  adverse  tradeoffs  that  are  involved withthe  Phillips  curve  do not  occur.  Implicit  in that  argument,  if  we  areto  move toward price stability, is  that  the process  in and of  itselfinduces  an acceleration of productivity.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  I would agree with your  conclusion that we needhigher productivity growth, but  I have not seen  any evidence thatconvinces  me  that we would get  it.  But  certainly  if we  did get it,  orif  productivity growth were higher,  it would be  easier by an  order  ofmagnitude  to  live with price  stability.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We do  see  significant  acceleration inproductivity  in the  anecdotal  evidence and in  the manufacturing areawhere  our  ability to  measure  is  relatively good.  We  can  see thatacceleration  if we  look  at  individual manufacturing  industries.  It  isour macro data  that  are  giving us  the  1 percent productivity growthfor  the  combination of  gross  industrial  product  and grossnonindustrial product, which do not  show this  phenomenon.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  One  could  argue  that we have  roughly a 1 percentbias  in  the CPI  so  that  right now we have,  say, 2 percent productivitygrowth and 2 percent  core  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We have not had such productivity growthfor  long.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Such productivity growth would mean that  we areliving successfully with 2 percent  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  is  exactly the point.  That  isanother way of  looking at  it.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Because productivity growth is  really higherthan we have  measured it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In  fact  there  is  obviously an exact,one-to-one tradeoff.  That  is,  we  can  reach price stability either bydriving down  the  inflation  rate  and getting productivity to bounce  upor  by revising down  the  inflation  figures  and producing higherproductivity!  [Laughter]7/2-3/96-47-

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I am perfectly happy with the  last view.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Al.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  This  is  a big  and broad  issue.  Janet hasapproached  it  one way.  I am going  to  approach it  a somewhat differentway rather  than  try  to  respond  in  detail  to  her comments,  which  Ithought  were very interesting  and constructive.  For some  time now, wehave  had these monetary aggregate ranges under  the Humphrey-Hawkinsprocedure, but  I think we would all  agree  that they have  not beeneffectively playing their  traditional  role  of  serving as  a nominalanchor for monetary policy and a signal  of  the  Federal  Reserve'scommitment  to  longer-term price  stability.  We need a better anchor.We have  discussed this  issue  on  several  occasions  in  the  last  coupleof years,  and  I am glad we are  continuing  the  discussion today.  But  Iwould hope that  we can  do  just  a little more  today than  simply discussthis  issue  and perhaps get  at  least a little closer to  deciding on  astrategy for  actually achieving our  longer-term objective.  We do  alot  of  strategic planning at  the  Fed;  we have  a strategic plan  forsupervision and regulation and we have  a strategic plan  for financialservices.  Mike  Kelley and Susan Phillips  and our  staff  colleagues  areworking on  an umbrella strategic plan.  I think we need a better andclearer strategic  plan for monetary policy.In  thinking about  this,  I found Dave Stockton's  memo veryconstructive but mainly in  the  sense  that  it  serves  to  underline  andmake very clear  the  substantial disagreement  among economists  andothers regarding  exactly what our long-term goal  should be  and how weshould pursue  it,  and the  large number  of  complicated  issues  in  thisarea.  Reading  that memo and  listening to Janet  Yellen has  served toconvince me that  if  we are really going  to make  progress, we need toprioritize some  of  these  issues.  In particular, I think we need  tosort  out  those  issues  on which we might be  able  to  make  some progressrelatively easily in  the  near future  from those that  are going to  bemore  difficult  and complicated and  take  longer to  deal with.  Againstthat  background, I ask myself whether  there  are particular points,even  if  they are  limited ones,  that  most  or  at  least many of  us  aroundthis  table  could agree  on to  serve  as  a starting point  or  a corner-stone for building a long-term strategy.This may involve  some  risks,  but  I would assert  that  thereare,  or  at  least there may be, some points  of  agreement.  I think mostof us would accept  the view that  at  a minimum we want  to  hold the  lineon  inflation--that  is,  to preserve the  gains we have  made  over thelast  15  years  or  so  in bringing the  trend inflation rate  down and  thento bring  the rate  down at  least  somewhat  further over  a period oftime.  Moreover,  I think many of  us would regard  the  line  to be  heldas  an underlying rate of  something like  3 percent  on  the  core CPI,although we can  debate which measure  it  should be.  Most  of us wouldlike  to  avoid a situation where the underlying trend rate  of  inflationmoves back up  significantly over  3 percent  for  any length of  time.  IfI am right  that we could  forge  a consensus  on what  I would regard aspretty basic points--that's obviously because  they leave most of  thereally difficult  questions  unanswered and I recognize  that--I  thinkacceptance of  these points would be  consistent with  either theopportunistic  or  the  conventional  deliberate  approach to policy, inthe  language  of  the Orphanides  and Wilcox paper  that Don Kohndistributed back in May.  I would argue  that  agreement on  these points7/2-3/96-48---holding the  line  on  inflation  at  3 percent  and  subsequently bringingthe  rate  down  further--would at  least be  a start.  I think  that  isimportant.  It  would move the  ball  forward  two  or  three yards  in whatis  certainly going  to  be  a very difficult ball  game, and it  would doso  for  the  first  time  since we  have been talking  about  this  issue overthe  last  year and half  or so.To get  the  full  benefit,  though,  I think we would need tomake  some  explicit public  reference  to  these benchmark points  and ourcommitment  to  them.  From my standpoint,  Mr. Chairman,  an idealopportunity would be your upcoming Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony.  Someof you may recall  that  I made essentially the  same proposal at  theseveral  people  responded, not unreasonably, that what  really mattersis  not words  so much as  deeds,  and that  certainly is  true  in  general.But  I'm not  sure  that we have to  choose  between words  and deeds.  Ithink a few well  chosen words  stemming from the  right  source, backedup by deeds,  can be  a powerful  credibility builder  over  time.  Theadvantage  of  a public  reference  to  a 3 percent ceiling, as  I see  it,is  that  it  would commit us  to  something at  least  a bit more concretethan simply indicating our  commitment  to price  stability over  someindefinite  time horizon.  We would be putting something on  the  recordfor which we could more  easily be  held accountable.  The  bottom lineis  that  this kind  of  commitment would raise the probability--maybe nota whole  lot but at  least  somewhat--that we would  eventually get  toprice  stability and achieve our  longer-term goals.  In  this  difficultarea, I think that  is  reason enough  for doing it.  Also,  I thinkpublic  support  for  the notion of  holding the  line  on  inflation andthen  subsequently making  some  further progress is  probably as  high nowas  it  ever  will be.If  we  succeed in putting  a firm ceiling  on  inflation, wecould subsequently move on  to  the  separate and more difficult  issuesrevolving  around how we should go about  reducing inflation further  --what the  timing  should be and what  approaches we  should use.  Janethas done  an excellent  job of  outlining some  of  these  issues  andtradeoffs.  At  this  stage,  two  approaches  have been suggested  --  anopportunistic  approach and  a conventional or more  deliberate  approach.I am uncomfortable with the  opportunistic  approach, and Iwill  offer  three reasons why.  First,  keeping in mind that  theultimate goal  is  not  temporary price  stability but permanent pricestability, an opportunistic  strategy seems  to  be  premised on the  ideathat  recessions are permanently rather  than  just  temporarilydisinflationary.  I have  trouble understanding that.  It  does not makea lot  of  sense  to me unless the  recession  is  a byproduct  of  deliberateefforts by the Federal Reserve  to  reduce  trend  inflation.  In  short,  Iam not  sure  that  there are  autonomous  recession opportunities  outthere,  if  I can use that  awkward phrase,  that  can be counted on  toreduce  inflation  permanently in  the absence  of  some deliberate  effortto do  so  on  our part.Second, I think one  of  the  more persuasive arguments  forfollowing an opportunistic policy would be that  it might deflect  someof  the  criticism we could be  expected to  receive  if  we  follow a moredeliberate  approach and are perceived by  the public  as  perhaps  keepingpolicy tight and keeping  the  economy  slack as  a way of  reducing theinflation rate.  But  if  this  kind of  strategy is  going to  work, it7/2-3/96-49-would seem to  imply that  in recessions  we would not  ease  policy asaggressively as  we would  if  we were not  trying  to  reduce  the  inflationrate permanently.  At  first  glance,  it might  look  as  if  this  approachwould be less  visible,  less  open to  criticism, less  of  a  lightningrod, and thus  one  that  would be  more likely  to  succeed.  But  I  thinkthere  is  a risk here that  eventually  the  public would catch  on, andthen we would be  open  to  the  criticism that  we are not  easing policyaggressively enough  in a  recession.  Think of  the phrases  that  mightcome out  --  "we are  kicking the  economy while  it  is  down"  and  soforth.  If  we got  that  kind of  feedback, that  could undermine theeffectiveness  of  this  strategy over  time.  So,  it  is  not  really clearto me what we would be gaining  from  this  approach.Third  and finally,  I have always  thought  that  the wordopportunistic  had a mildly pejorative connotation.  So  I looked  it  upin Webster's  and it  is  defined as  follows:  "The act, policy, orpractice  of  taking advantage of  opportunities  or  circumstances,especially with  little regard to  principles  or  consequences."[Laughter]  So,  if  we  decide  to  adopt  this  strategy,  I would hope thatat  least we would find  another name  for  it.  Better yet,  I think  itwould be better  to  follow  a more  deliberate, conventional  policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Principled opportunism.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Or  deliberate moderation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If  we are  going  to  get  anywhere, wecan't  have people  literally  talking at  cross purposes.  Janet,  you didnot  even  accept  the premise with which Al  is  starting,  that everyoneagrees that  we  should seek price  stability as  a goal.  If we  are  goingto  get anywhere,  the question  I have  to  ask  first  is  whether you  agreewith Al  that  price stability  is  a goal  we should  seek.  If  you do  not,this  discussion  then gets  to  the  question  of  whether  there  is  aconsensus  among the Committee  members  that price  stability issomething that  should be  our long-term  goal,  not  how we get  there.First,  we have  to  agree on  the  goal.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I would simply  respond to  that by saying  thatthe  Federal  Reserve  Act  directs us  to  aim  for  both maximum employmentand price  stability.  To  the  extent  that  there  is  no  tradeoff  at  lowinflation rates  and there  are benefits  that  outweigh  the  short-runcosts,  then  price  stability, literally zero  inflation,  is  good and weshould go  for  it.  To  the  extent  that  there is  a tradeoff,  we have toweigh what  to  do,  and  I think  I am pointing to  the possibility of atradeoff as  we  go  to very  low inflation rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So,  you are discussing  the  issue of  thetransition, not  the ultimate goal?

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  No,  I am discussing  the  issue  of  the ultimateobjective.  If we  have to pay a permanent price at  zero  measuredinflation in the  form of  permanently less  employment  and higherunemployment,  I do not  read the  Federal  Reserve Act  as  unambiguouslytelling us  that  we should choose price  stability  and  forego maximumemployment.7/2-3/96-50-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The Humphrey-Hawkins Act  says  that weshould have  3 percent  adult unemployment.  That  is  the  law of  theland.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  But  it  does  not  obligate  the  Federal  Reserve  topursue that  goal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  fact  that  it  is promulgated  in astatute  does not  mean that  it  is  achievable  or  that  it  is  somethingthat we  assume  is  achievable because  it  is  in the  statute.  If  I canget  the  two  of you  to  reconcile, we  can move  forward.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I'm not  really sure  that  we are approachingthe  problem that differently.  I am  talking more  about the process.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Something is  happening  to  the soundwaves  between  there and here.  [Laughter]  Go  ahead, Bob.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  is  there a way to  focus  on what wasagreed to between  them as  an  interim  step?  It  looked as  though bothhad the  same view about  the  desirability of  not  allowing inflation  togo  higher.  There  also was  a very explicit agreement  that  inflationshould begin  to  move lower,  and  I think  I heard Janet  say somethinglike a  full  percentage point  lower.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I agree, yes.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Why not  set  that  out  as  an  objective, and  then wecan have  another meeting when we  reach it.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I would like  to  second that.  I think  that  isa great  idea.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That would mean more progress  than we have madein 11  years.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Janet,  didn't you  say that?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That  is  actually what  she  said.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  That  is  what  I said, what Bob  Parry  just  stated.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That's  progress;  now we have  to  talk about  whenand how.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  There  are 17  other people  besides  the  two of  us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  okay, but you would be  surprisedat what happens  in  a discussion.  If you let  everybody speak and ifthey all  deliver  the  speeches  that  they prepared before walking  intothis  room, we will  come out  of  this  room with  chaos.  Let me  see  if  wecan  establish some  structure  for  our  discussion.  Can you  give methree sentences  in  conclusion on how you view  the question:  Is  long-term price  stability an appropriate  goal of  the Federal  ReserveSystem?

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Mr. Chairman, will you  define  "price stability"for me?7/2-3/96-51-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Price  stability  is  that  state  in whichexpected changes  in  the  general price  level  do not  effectively alterbusiness  or household decisions.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Could you please  put a number  on  that?[Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I would  say the  number  is  zero,  ifinflation  is  properly measured.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Improperly measured, I believe  that  headingtoward  2 percent  inflation would be a good  idea, and  that  we should doso  in a  slow  fashion,  looking at  what happens  along  the  way.  Mypresumption based on  the  literature  is,  as  Bob  Parry summarized  it,that  given  current  inaccurate measurements, heading  toward 2 percentis  most  likely  to  be beneficial.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Could we  leave  it  at  that?  Let  us nowmove  on.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I'm not  sure  I'm going  to  offer anything helpfulin  terms  of  how this  discussion  is  progressing.  I may want  to  comeback in  a moment  to  the  issues  about productivity because  I think thatthe  incentive  effects,  on business  decision-makers  in particular, withregard  to efficiency  and productivity versus what  Janet was  citingabout wage  cuts  are  an  important  manifestation of  what we are  tryingto  do.  The  Chairman's version  does not  affect  business  decisions.In my view, businesses  and households make  their bestbusiness  decisions, when they expect  the purchasing power  of  thedollar  to be  the  same in  the  future  as  it  is  today.  It  may turn  outto  be  somewhat more  or  somewhat  less, but people  make  the mostefficient  decisions  about  the  allocation  of  resources  when they  expectthe  value  of  the  dollar  to be  the  same  later  as  it  is  currently.  If  Icould be  persuaded that  permanently eroding or  conceivably  increasingthe purchasing power of  the  currency, changing the  standard of  valueover  time,  somehow improves  resource allocation and standards  ofliving,  I would be very interested.  But  I am not persuaded.  If  wecan create  a situation  in which people  say that  the dollar willpurchase  the  same  in  the  future  as  it  does  today and  they proceed tobase  their decisions  on  that  expectation as  the most  probable  outcome,we  then would get  standards  of  living  that  rise  at  their maximumpotential.  We also would get maximum employment  and the  otherdevelopments  that  foster  economic well being.  The question  about aninflation objective versus  a price  level  objective  is  relevant only ifwe  do not have  instant  and total  forgetfulness.  If  bygones  aretotally bygones no  matter what happened yesterday, and  if  all  of  priorhistory has no  effect  on people,  and  their best expectation  for  thefuture  is  that  the dollar will buy the  same  later  as  it  does  today,then  there  simply  is  no  difference between the  two  types  ofobjectives.  They are identical.  A difference  comes  into play only tothe  extent  that  there  is  a credibility  issue.  If  there  is  uncertaintyabout  the objective, people will  treat  yesterday's price shocks  assomething  that we will  or will not  offset.  We  then get a differencebetween  a price  level  objective  and an  inflation objective.  If  we  aregoing  to  talk about  the difference  between those  two, we have  to  talkabout  credibility and how we  can  achieve  it.7/2-3/96-52-With regard to  international  comparisons,  I too  thought  aboutCanada.  I have  looked at  it  and tried to understand whether  there  issomething useful  for us  to  learn  there  or not.  Since  I do not  speakFrench and do  not know what  to do  about  the problem of  Quebec,  Iusually  focus  on  the  other provinces.  Investment  in  British Columbiaand Alberta  is  extraordinarily different  from  that  in  the Maritimes,for  instance.  If  I had to  conclude anything about Canada  in  the  lastfew years, given the  separatist  effort,  I would say that  I just  do  notfind  its  experience useful  for  the United  States.  I would rather  saylet  us  learn  from New Zealand because  they reduced inflation  to  2percent and had  6 percent real  GDP growth.  But my guess  is  that  otherpeople would not  find  that  the  right  place  for us  to  learn from.If  I were going  to  do  surveys  about wage  cuts  or  increases  ofthe  sort  that  Janet reported on, one  of  the  surveys  I would want  toconduct  is  to  ask people as  we approach the  end of  this  century tochoose between  two  things.  If  the  central bank had an objective  ofreducing the purchasing power of  the dollar  to  13  cents  or  7 centsover  the next  century, which would you prefer?  I would  expect  themajority of  the  responses  to be,  why are you going to  reduce  it atall?  Explain  to me why  the dollar  is  not going to purchase  the  sameat  the  end of  the  next  century as  it  does  today.  The differencebetween  13  cents  and 7 cents  is  the  difference between a 2 percentrate  of inflation  and a 3 percent  rate of  inflation over  100  years.  Ithink most people would view that  as  a silly alternative.  They wouldsay, why not  zero inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I know you will  all  be happy that  I am  going toscrap my prepared comments.  I will  just  address a couple of  issuesthat  both Al  Broaddus  and Janet Yellen raised because  I am in  completeagreement  with two  things  on which I think they agreed.  That  is,  weshould  at a minimum hold  the  line  on  inflation where  it  is  and gosomewhat  further  if  we  can do  so.  Now, it  seems  to  me  that  thecontext  in which we  should go  somewhat  further is  the important  aspectof  this.  I would argue that  that  context has  to  be  one where we havea favorable economic  situation  including decent  levels  of  growth,employment,  and so  on.All  of  that  depends  on the  subject  that was raised before--productivity growth and ways  in which productivity growth  can beenhanced in order to  bring about  this  favorable  economic situation.Does  a climate  of  low inflation  enhance productivity growth  to  thepoint where we  can reliably go  from 3 percent  inflation  to 2-1/2percent,  to  2 percent,  or to  the  1-1/2  percent  that we had on  averageover most  of  the  1950s  and  the  first  half of  the  1960s?  I do notknow.  In my view monetary policy's  impact on  the  ability  ofproductivity to  grow is  indirect.  It  creates a climate  in which Ithink people make better decisions  and  focus  on  investments  thatenhance productivity  as  opposed  to  speculation.  So,  I believe  thereis  an indirect  effect of  low stable rates  of  inflation  and arguably ofproductivity enhancing  investments.  That is  where monetary policy hasan important  impact  on  the  growth of productivity.  There  are  othersthat  have some  role to play  in productivity growth, however.  Fiscalpolicy has  a role to  play.  The  amount of  investment  that we  arewilling to  make either  on a public  or  a private basis  in  our  education7/2-3/96-53-systems has  a role  to play.  Those  are  not  things  that monetary policycan affect.  But  I think in  terms  of  how we discuss moving  from wherewe are  to potentially  lower and lower  rates  of  inflation, it  has  to  bein  the  context  of  better productivity growth, a better overalleconomic  situation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman, I think pricestability  is  a means  to  an  end, and  the  end is  sustained  economicgrowth, which is  how  I resolve what  appears  to  be  the  conflict  in  theHumphrey-Hawkins  legislation and the  Federal Reserve  Act.  I defineprice  stability exactly the way you do.  First of  all,  it  is  a verygood working definition,  and secondly, since you are  the head of  theFederal  Reserve,  using your definition makes a great deal  of  sense  forall  of  us.  If we  each have  a different  definition of  price  stability,it  certainly  confuses  the body politic.  Since most  of  the  speechesthat  I give  are  on price  stability, because  I think  that  is  what weought  to be  talking about,  I would also  argue  that  it  has majorsociological  and  therefore political benefits.  Since most people canunderstand  that  more  readily than  the  economic definition of pricestability,  I think it  gets  the  point  across  better.As  long as  you are willing not to put  a number  on  this purelyverbal  definition of price  stability, we  in  fact have  a nationalconsensus  on  it.  Therefore, the  question  is whether  it  is  toanybody's benefit  to  define  it  more exactly.  I am reminded of my daysat  Holy Cross  College  studying  scholastic philosophy, which  had beendebating more or  less  the  same  major points  for  seven centuries  by  thetime  I came  along.  Some of  those points  on  which absolute  truth hadnot been defined are probably  easier  to  resolve than  an exactnumerical  definition of price  stability.  I am not  sure  that  we  areever going  to  find  the absolute  truth here  or  that  the  search  for  thisabsolute  truth  is  anything  other  than something  that  would give  theFOMC  something  to do  for the  next  seven  centuries.  [Laughter]Therefore, why would we want  to have  anything other than  the  informalconsensus that  we have?  I think  the reason  is  that  an  informalconsensus  is  more  easily breached  than  if  somehow we  could bring abouta more  formalized national  agreement  that price  stability is  theappropriate goal  of monetary policy.  Previously  in  our history, wehad  something  closer  to  price  stability  for  a period of  10  or,arguably, 15  years,  as noted  in  the  Stockton paper,  and that  did notkeep us  from  the  guns-and-butter decisions  of  the  1960s  and  1970s  thatended that  period of  relatively  stable prices.  It  had to bereachieved, assuming we think  that we  are  somewhere  close to  it  now,at enormous  expense  to  the  American people.I think the  people who  should  decide that  price  stability,hopefully as  a means  to  an  end,  is  the  appropriate goal  of monetarypolicy are not  the people  sitting around  this  table.  Rather,  itshould be the American people  through their  representatives  in  theCongress.  We  are dealing with pieces  of  existing  legislation  that weare defining  in  a way that makes  it  possible for  us  to do  our  jobs.But  those pieces  of  legislation are  on  the statute  books,  and  it wouldseem to me  that  in due  course,  i.e.,  not  in  a year  divisible by four,it  would be  a reasonable  and  appropriate thing for  the  American peopleto debate  through their elected representatives.  We could certainlymake an active  contribution to  that  debate.  My guess  is  that  it would7/2-3/96-54-probably be better  for  the Federal  Open Market Committee not  to  take  aposition on  this  issue as  an  institution.  I say that because  if  wesaid price  stability  is  2 percent--if we were  ever  able  to  agree onthat--we might set  the Federal  Reserve  against  the people.  I thinkthat  would be  a very  likely outcome, and in my view it  would not  be  inthe  interest  of  the people  or  this  institution.If  the people wanted to  formalize  the  idea  of price  stabilityas  the  goal  for monetary policy, we are  certainly unlikely  in thelegislative process  to  get  that  defined in numerical  terms,  andprobably not  even as unspecifically as  a range.  In  a public  speech,  Isuggested a range  of  1/2  percent  to  2 percent  largely because  of  thelack of  precision in such  a range and also because  I believe verystrongly that  although  inflation  is  bad, deflation is  truly  terrible.Therefore,  if  in the  implementation of  price stability we make modestmistakes on the  up side,  I justify  those  as an  insurance premiumagainst  the much greater evils  of  deflation.  That's  why I wind uppretty much where Janet Yellen  did--in  the  2 percent  area.  In anyevent,  I believe that  the  search  for absolute  truth is  not  going toget us  there.  I also believe  that  the  true decision on  anything morethan the working  definition, which I think  is  the  working consensusthat  we have now, is  really something of  such  great  importance  to oursociety that  it  should be the American people  who decide  that  throughthe normal  legislative processes.  I do  not  think it  is  up  to us  tomake what  I think would be  a rather  dramatic and far-reachinginterpretation of what the  statutes  on  the books  actually mean.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thomas Aquinas would be  impressed!Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I am very impressed with  the Vice  Chairman'sJesuit  training, and I think I agree with him completely.  I alsoagreed with what  I thought Janet Yellen  said, which  is  that we  shouldreduce  inflation  to  a lower rate  and we  should proceed gradually  fromthere as  we gain  experience.  Having  agreed with her,  I got verynervous when Al  Broaddus  said he was not  going to  rebut her becausethe  readers  of  this  transcript  five years  from now will  then concludethat we  actually are  all  on one  side  of  the  issue.  So,  I am going  todo  the  rebuttal  that Al  did not  do  only because  she provoked me withthe  use of  the word  "taxes."  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  was not  "taxes;"  that  was"tactics."  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  No,  she  said the word  "taxes."  I heard it  andshe  is  not going to  get  away with  this!Let  me start  off with  some  calculations very quickly.  Thepresence of  retirement vehicles  does not solve  the problem, and hereare  some  examples.  Let  us  do an  IRA-type calculation versus  apermanent  savings account  that  is  taxed every year  and a  "let'sabolish  inflation"  calculation.  If  you have a 30  percent  tax rate,  a2 percent real  return,  and no  inflation, the  real  after-tax returnafter 20  years  is  34  percent.  If  you do  not have  IRAs,  after 20  yearsthe real  return  would be  10-1/2  percent,  assuming 3 percentinflation.  If  you do have  IRAs,  it  is  19.7  percent.  That's becauseunder  the  IRA system,  the  fact  is  the  inflation buildup  is  still  taxed7/2-3/96-55-and  so  the  real  return is  depressed.  So,  in  fact,  you have  to  takeinflation out  of  the  system in  order to  solve  the problem.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  I merely meant  that  the  existence  of  IRAs  cutsthe  welfare gains  from lowering  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It  cuts  the gains,  but by this  calculation  itwould reduce the  gains  by 40  percent, not  by 90  percent.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  I did not  say what  the  quantitative  impact was.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Okay, I just wanted to  put  that  in.  Theeconomics profession has  for  30  years  gone  through the  functionalequivalent  of  CRA reform by arguing  that we  should change  the  tax  codefor  inflation  indexing.  We have tried, we have  tried, we  have  tried,we have tried;  we have  failed, we  have  failed, we have  failed, we havefailed.  It  is  not  going to happen, and  I think the  reason  is  summedup  in what  is  the most egregious part  of  inflation  treatment  in  thetax code,  and  that  is  depreciation.  Back  in the  early ReaganAdministration, indexing depreciation was  one  of  the proposed reforms.The  companies are not  for  it;  the  Congress  is  not  for  it.  When  it  wastried again in 1995,  it  just  floated up there and was absolutely  shotdown because, horror of  horrors,  a company could actually deduct  overtime more dollars  than  it  spent.  That  was  considered politicallyunacceptable by  the  enlightened members of  the  Congress.  So,  we  arenever, never, never in my opinion ever  going  to  index our  tax  codecorrectly.  That  is  not  a first-best solution because  it  is  not asolution.Second, on nominal wage  rigidities,  I agree with youranalysis;  I think it  is  right on  target.  Here  is  the case  forreducing  inflation gradually, which  is  where  I agree with youcompletely.  What would happen  is  that,  over  time, we would see  achange  in  the method of  compensation in  the  economy toward a profit-sharing mode.  If we  reduce inflation gradually enough, there  is  timefor this  fundamental  change in  compensation to  occur.  Then,  I do notthink we will  have  the  same  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve  as we  hadbefore.  Such  a change  is  happening  right now.Third, I think  there are  a lot  of  other rigidities  in  thesystem.  One  classic  example  is  our  housing mortgage  rules with whichI am  intimately aware  and have  discussed.  There  the  solution is  noinflation.  So,  I do  think  that  the  social  gains  to no  inflation  inthe  long,  long term are actually greater than you  suggested, Janet,and the  cost,  if we  do  it  slowly and gradually and allow the  laborto  2 percent  inflation,  and I will  bet  that  if  we  do  it  gradually, wecan move  lower  than  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I have a solution  to your politicalproblem regarding depreciation that we  can  solve.  We  just have  tomake our  dollar bills  smaller and smaller  to  reflect  the  loss  ofpurchasing power.  The total  amount  of paper would be  the  same.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  The ecological  effects would be  the  same,  andwe would be  all  set.7/2-3/96-56-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  real  value of  the  currency and  thevalue of  the  paper would be  invariant  to  the  purchasing power  of  theoriginal  outlay.  I better call  on  Tom Hoenig!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  You have  lost  me, Mr.  Chairman;  I don't  knowwhere to  go  from  there!To  address  the question as  you  framed it  in  your discussionwith  Janet Yellen  and Al  Broaddus,  I would like  to  observe  that  frommy perspective the  evidence as  presented in Dave  Stockton's paper  andothers  is  that high inflation is  bad.  Everyone agrees with that.  Italso  is  clear  that,  given  the purpose of  money, zero  inflationproperly measured is  where we  should be  over  time.  Our experienceshows  that  even modest  inflation causes  distortions over  time  in termsof  incentives  and signals  in the  economy  and that  inflation thereforelowers productivity.  In my view that  requires  that we take  thelegislation  that  is  in place now and pursue  stable prices  seriously.I think the  mandate is  there.  In  implementing  that mandate,  I wouldagree with Bob Parry and Al  Broaddus  that we  ought  to  start  somewhere.I would accept 2 percent  inflation as  the  interim goal  if  we  can agreeon  a reasonable  timeframe  in which we would move  systematically towardthat  goal.  I think we would be much better off  doing it  over  somedefinite  time period than arguing over whether we  have  a propermeasure  for  zero  inflation.  So,  I think moving toward lowerinflation, defined as  2 percent,  is  a good intermediate goal.  When weget  there, we  can see  how the markets  and producers  react  and discussat  that  time whether  inflation  ought  to go  to  zero  and whether we havethe right measure  for  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have  a few random,hopefully not  inconsistent, observations  about  all  this.  For me,  theissues  that we have been discussing are  largely empirical  issues.willing to  take her estimates.  If  she believes  there are net  benefitsin going to  2 percent, then that  makes  sense  to  me.  The  only thing  Iwould add to  that  is  to  go  slowly  to  2 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Janet  said  "probably."

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Right.  Go  slowly to  2 percent, probably.  Iwould add that  Bob Lucas  currently has  a paper  that also  estimatessignificant gains  from bringing down the rate  of  inflation.  So,  Iwould throw that  into  the  thinking here.  I would not do  this  with thehope or  expectation  that we are  going to  get  a lot  of  benefits  fromcredibility, especially  in the  short  run.  I just  am not  aware  of  anyevidence  of  significant  credibility effects.  I will not  get  into  itright now, but  I think what we  are  talking about  is  going to  involvesome challenging  implementation  issues.  Even  capping  the rate ofinflation at  3 percent, while  it  sounds simple, may not  turn out  to bequite  so  simple at  all.  In fact,  we may be  confronted with  that  issuebefore  too long.  But what  really concerns me  about all  this  and why Iam coming out where  I am  is  that  I want  to  avoid something  that putsus  back in the  late  1970s  and early  1980s kind of  situation.  I wouldlike  to  institutionalize our anti-inflation effort to  a greater  degreethan we have been able  to  do  up  to  this point because  I think anincrease  in  inflation  could really be  costly.  I would not be  so7/2-3/96-57-worried if  it  increased from 3 percent  to  4 percent  for a short periodof  time.  We  really get  into  trouble  it  seems  to  me when inflationgoes  from 3 percent  to  6 percent  to  10  percent and higher.  I think wewould benefit  from institutionalizing  something that  would helpstrengthen  the  process  to prevent  such a rise  from happening.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  that  is  an  interesting point  toapply  to what we have been  saying.  There  is  another  side  to  thisissue,  namely whether  there  is  a tendency for  inflation to  go  in  theother direction  if  we  do not move  toward price stability,  That  is  anopportunity  cost  that has  to be  addressed.  If  Gary is  right,  and  Isuspect  he may well  be, that  complicates  the  issue  greatly.  GovernorMeyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you.  What  I want  to do  is  to  sort  out  alittle  of  the  evolution of  the  debate on  the  costs and benefits ofinflation and emphasize what  is  really novel  in  the points  thatGovernor Yellen was making.  What  she  has  introduced with  a muchstronger  theoretical basis  is  the notion  of  a permanent  tradeoff.That  is  what  is  really novel  to  the  debate.  I also want  to  tell  youwhy  I think the  Feldstein estimates  of  the  benefits of  lower  inflationare  wildly high.  Secondly,  I think we all  can  see, and  it  isremarkable  to me  at  my  first meeting, that  we are moving very quicklyto  a consensus  on,  if  not  a very long-term policy, at  least a policythat  goes more  than  from meeting  to meeting.  That,  I think, is  agreat  thing.  Finally,  I do  want  to  respond to Al's  questions  aboutopportunistic disinflation, and I want  to  explain  to you perhaps  alittle more clearly how it  actually works.First  of  all, what  do we  know about  the  costs  and benefits?I think  it  is  very clear,  from the  Stockton paper  in particular,  thatthe  benefits  from  reducing inflation when  it  is  already high are  largeand clearly justify the  cost  associated with disinflation.  What  ishigh?  What are  we talking  about--15 percent, 10  percent,  7 percent,all  of  those?  We would not  be  sitting here  arguing if  inflation werein  that vicinity, and we would not  be  having a debate on  deliberate  oropportunistic strategies.  Unfortunately, the benefits  of  reducinginflation  from an  already modest  rate  are very difficult  to pin down,surprisingly  so,  and may not  justify the cost  of  disinflation.  Whatpeople have  been saying,  I think, is  that  the  benefits of  very lowinflation are there;  it  has  to  get  to  zero;  price stability is  alwaysbetter.  And yet  we have  difficulty actually pinning that  down  in ourcross-country and time-series  analyses.  In my view--not  everybodywould agree--there  is  clearly a sizable  one-time cost associated withdisinflation and absolutely not a shred of  evidence that  enhancedcredibility of  the  Fed  from announced or  legislated inflation targetsreduces  that  cost.One thing we  should take  into  account  is  that while the  costof  disinflation  is  high,  to  the  extent  that  it  is  a one-time cost,  wehave to  balance  that  cost  against  the permanent flow  of benefits  fromprice  stability or  low  inflation.  That  is  a very powerful  argument,one  that Feldstein also has  made.  But here  is  the  key.  There  arehints  that  inflation can be too  low as well  as  too high  from theperspective  of  achieving optimal  resource allocation and hence thehighest  possible living standards.  But  the  evidence here  remainsinconclusive.  This  is  what  is  really new to  the debate.  The  debatewas always  between the  one-time  cost  of disinflation  and the permanent7/2-3/96-58-benefits of  lower  inflation.  Now all  of  a sudden we  are  confronted bythe  fact  that  it  is  not only  a one-time cost  that we  might be willingto pay, but  there might be  a permanent  cost of  lower  inflation,particularly when  it  gets  below 2 percent.  This  is  a theme  that  wasnot  emphasized in  the  Stockton paper, but I think it  is  important.There is  a stronger  case  that  deflation  is  harmful  to macroeconomicperformance.  This weighs  against  the price level  as  opposed  to aninflation  target.  I do  not think anybody has  a real  difficulty withthat notion, but  I think  that  is  important.  So  when we talk aboutprice  stability, we  do  not  exactly mean price  stability in  the  senseof  a fixed price  level that we get  back to.Having  said all  this,  I see  all  the different  sidesconverging to  a debate  about  what  our provisional  targets  should be,not having  decided whether we as  a Committee  believe in  a deliberateor  an  opportunistic strategy, and I will  come  to  that  in a minute.But without deciding on exactly what  the path is,  we have  an agreementthat we want  to  hold the  line  at about  3 percent  on  core CPI  and thatprovisionally we want  to  set  a very explicit target  for  ourselves.  Weseem to be headed toward agreement  on  2 percent  inflation.  We stillhave to  debate how we get  there,  but  this  is  a lot  of  progress.  Ithink this  is  a good idea  in terms  of  testing the  waters, because  allof  these  issues are  still  quite  unresolved in my own mind.  I am veryworried, and again  I really have not made up my mind as  to  whether  ornot  there are permanent costs  to  price stability  or very  lowinflation.  I never taught  it  that  way, but  I am quite prepared toconsider that possibility, and  I think testing  the waters  gives ustime.  As  Governor Lindsey  said, quite possibly when we get  to 2percent  inflation  and we  find how much we like  it  and perhaps  how muchthe  real  economic  environment may have  improved, it  will  give us  newconfidence  to  take  the next  step.Now that  we  seem to  have  all  this  wonderful  agreement,  thatleaves us with one  issue:  How do we  get  from 3 percent to  2 percentinflation?  That brings  us  to  the difference between the  deliberateand  the  opportunistic  strategies.  There  is  one  strategy that wasarticulated by Jerry Jordan in  previous meetings--I  enjoyed goingthrough the  transcripts  for  those meetings--where he  said  that  hewould measure  economic performance  over  1996  and 1997  and  evaluatemonetary policy solely by whether  inflation was  lower over  thatperiod.  That  is  not the  way I would do  it  at  all.  This  leads me  tocomment  on what  the  opportunistic approach says  and how it  achievesits  objective.  What Al  Broaddus  was worried about was  that  recessionsare  temporary.  They come  and they go.  How do  we get  permanentthat  there  is  an  asymmetry built  into an  opportunistic  strategy,  andhere is  how  it  works.  During good  times, we  only get  up  to  fullemployment;  we never go beyond  it.  During  other  times,  the unemploy-ment  rate  is  always  above  the NAIRU.  If  the unemployment  rateaverages  above  the NAIRU we are  disinflating on  average.  That  is whatthe  opportunistic  strategy does.  What  goes with that  is  that  if  youwant  to  stop  at  2 percent  inflation,  that has  interestingimplications.  It means  that  once you get  there,  for  every recessionyou treat yourself to  a boom.  You  treat yourself  to  a littleoverheating because  that  is what  it will  take  to  keep the  averageinflation rate  constant.7/2-3/96-59-My final  comment  is,  gee  this  is  even more  fun  than Ithought  it  was going  to  be!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Tomorrow morning  I am going to  arguethat we  are already at  2 percent  inflation.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Hold the  line at  2 percent  then!

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Let me  tell you why I think Feldstein  is wrong.The  issue here  is  the  existence  of  inflation non-neutralities  in  thetax  system,  for  example,  tax  depreciation based  on original  cost.Inflation  essentially raises  the  cost of  capital  to  firms.  Think ofthese  inflation nonneutralities  as  being like  an excise tax  that  isimposed on  firms.  What are  they going  to  do with  that?  They aregoing to  try to  shift  the  burden.  How do  they do  it?  They  shift  theburden by in  fact  lowering  investment,  which lowers  interest  rates  andforces  lower interest  rates  back to  consumers.  Now, consumers  can  saythey do  not want  those  lower  interest  rates,  and they can  try toescape  the burden  of  that  "excise tax" by  lowering their  savings.But here  is  the  rub.  It  is  a battle between who  is  more sensitive--business  firms  or households--just as  in  the  typical  excise  taxexample.  If  firms  are a lot more sensitive  to  interest  rates  thanhouseholds, and that  is what  I believe--my best  guess at  this  is  azero  responsiveness of  savings to  interest rates--then Feldstein  iscompletely wrong, blown out  of  the water.  I have  written a paper onthis,  though  I would not want the  staff  to  delve  into my econometricstoo  much, but as  a best  approximation I find that  what actuallyhappens  is  that  inflation induces  firms  to  shift back the burdenentirely to  households in  the  form of  lower  after-tax real  interestrates.  Households do not  escape that  at all.  In  the  process, theafter-tax real  cost of  capital  to  firms  is  unchanged, and there  is  noinflation  bias  to  the  savings-investment process.  That might be  asextreme  as  Feldstein's  argument.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  You are  assuming  that  savings are  notresponsive to  interest rates?

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  You assume  zero responsiveness?

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Yes.  That might be  as  extreme  as  Feldstein, butI want  to  say  it  is  no more  extreme  than Feldstein because  theinterest  elasticities he has picked are  so  wildly out  of  sight  fromany  empirical  evidence, whereas mine are quite  reasonably basedrelatively.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  This  has  already been a long day.  I must say Ihave a lot  of  sympathy with  the  sentiments expressed by BillMcDonough.  I did not have  the benefit  of  a Jesuit  training, but  Ihave had a lot of  economics,  as  did a lot  of  people around  the  table,and that  is  both a blessing and curse.  As  economists we  like  thingsto be  clear and objective  and logical.  The fact  is  that policymakingis  ambiguous,  judgmental,  and practical.  The best we  can do  is  to  tryto make  some  improvement  from where we are and stay away fromabsolutes.  With regard to  inflation, I think the best  we can  do  is  to7/2-3/96-60-hold the  line where we  are and move  inflation down a percentage pointor  so  over  time and see where we  are  at  that  point.  I think we  can dothat  over  the next  several  years  the way we have  gotten  inflation downover  the past  few years--we take  advantage of  the  business cycle;  wetake advantage  of  breaks when  they  come our way.  I do  think, however,that we need to put  this  strategy in  a framework  of growth.  For us  inthe  Fed  to  be perceived as  enemies  of  growth  is  a loser.  The ultimateobjective  of  monetary policy always needs  to  be  framed in  terms  ofmaximum  sustainable  growth and moving inflation down  is  a means  tothat  end.  If we  keep it  at  that  level,  I think we can make somepractical  progress and have  something  that  is  salable  to  the  generalpublic.  If  we  try to  do  a lot  more in  this  context,  I think we willlet perfection be  the  enemy of  improvement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Hear, hear.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  First of  all,  consistent withwhat  I have  said before,  I think  our  focus  ought  to be  on prices.  Inmy view, that  is  the  only thing we really  influence  in  the  long  run,and  that  is  what  our policy ought  to be  aimed at.  I agree with whatEd Boehne said;  we  really  are talking  about  a means  to  an end.  Lowand  stable  inflation  or price  stability, however you want  to  say  it,enables  the  economy to reach  its maximum potential.  That  is  ourultimate goal.My inclination  would be  to  take what  I perceive might be onthe  table now as  an interim step.  I think it  is  fairly easy--and I ambasing this  on  3 percent  core  CPI--to  get people  to  buy  into the  factthat such  an  inflation  rate  is  too  high.  When I talk  to  groups,  theytake notice when  I point out  to  them  that  a 3 percent  rate  ofinflation cuts  the  value of  the  dollar  in half  in a generation.  Wecan make  the  case  that  3 percent  inflation is  too  high and that  it  isreasonable  to move  it  another  notch lower.  I would  characterize thatas  just  another  step, and would continue  to  describe our  ultimate goalqualitatively and not  quantitatively at  this  point.  There may come  atime when we  are prepared to  quantify our ultimate objective, butright now  I would view our  intermediate objective  as  just  a step  alongthe path  to price stability.I think we would have  to  be  explicit about what  we weredoing.  In other words, whatever price  index we use,  we  shouldindicate  that we  have a particular quantitative  objective  in mind overa particular  timeframe.  I think  such transparency  is  beneficial  interms  of  enabling the  economy to make  the adjustments  that  need to  bemade  in connection with that  objective.  I suppose  that  smoothadjustment is  dependent  to  some  extent  on credibility, and we wouldhave  to  earn  that.This  is  an  objective  that we  are  setting for  ourselves, butthere  is  a benefit  in my view to being explicit  about  it.  In someways,  one  could look at  an  opportunistic  approach as  somewhatmisleading and likely to  create uncertainty that  does  not need toexist.  Unless we  are explicit, people do not  realize  that we  have inmind getting  inflation down  to  a particular  level,  and suddenly theyare  dealing with the  impact  that  our  actions  are having on  the  economywithout  prior knowledge of  their purpose.  I do not  think  that  isuseful.7/2-3/96-61-I also  think  that taking  a step  in  the  direction  that  I havebeen describing would be useful  to us  in  that  it  would force  us  to  domore  in  the public  education arena  in  terms  of  explaining  to  thepublic  the benefits of price  stability, however defined, the  costs  ofinflation,  and also  some of  the potential  offsets.  As  I have  said toyou before,  Alan, I think we have  a big job  to  do  in  terms  ofeducating  the public,  though I believe we are making progress.  Ithink people  recognize that  the kind of  business  environment  they haveenjoyed over  the  last  four to  five years  has  a lot  to  do withrelatively  low and relatively stable  inflation.  This  is  a good timeto  capitalize on  that,  and I think taking an  explicit  step  on our  ownand not waiting  for  legislation would  force us  to  move  further downthat path.Finally, just  a comment  on what Larry Meyer had to  say aboutthe  opportunistic  approach and how it  works.  Larry, in my experience,whenever we  get to whatever the NAIRU  is,  people  decide it  is  notreally there  and it  gets  revised lower.  This  is  true  of anything wepick.  What I worry a little about  is  the mentality that  I see emerg-ing here,  namely that we  are not going to  deal with inflation until  weactually see  "the whites  of  its  eyes."  That  approach  to  policy hasnever served us  well  in  the past,  but  in effect  that  is  what has  beenhappening.  We  get  to what people thought would be  the NAIRU, we  donot  see wage pressures,  and we  assume  that  the NAIRU must be  lower.So  it  keeps getting revised down.  At  some point, if  we are  wrongabout  that  and wage pressures hit  us when we have  not anticipatedthem,  it  is  going to  be much tougher  to  deal  with the  practicalitiesof  even containing  inflation at  3 percent.  That  concludes  what  I haveto  say, Alan.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  Very quickly.  It  seems  to  me that we have madea lot  of  progress despite the  fact  that we started with the wrongquestion.  [Laughter]  With all due  respect,  the  question,  shouldprice  stability be  THE goal  of  the  Federal  Reserve--meaning the onlygoal--is  not  the  right  question,  as  President  Boehne and  others havesaid.  Implicitly,  the goal has  got  to  be either maximum sustainablegrowth or, as  I would put  it,  raising the  standard of  living ofaverage Americans.  The  only way we  know how to  do  that  is  throughraising productivity.  Now, most  of us  read the  evidence as  indicatingthat  high inflation  is  detrimental  to  that  end, but  there  is  anempirical  question as  to  whether the costs  outweigh the benefits  ofgetting out  the  last  bit of  inflation.  Janet has made a persuasivecase,  I think,  that  there  are potential  costs  and we need to  learnmore  about  them in  getting  from 2 percent  to  zero  inflation.  I thinkwe  should be very humble before we say very much about  the  effects  onsavings  in  going from  2 or 3 percent  to  zero  inflation.  It  is  veryeasy to  show that  reducing  inflation increases the  rate  of  return tosavings.  That  is  very easy.  Wayne Angell  does  it  in The Wall  StreetJournal  this  morning, and Larry Lindsey was giving us  othercalculations.  But  the empirical  evidence that people  actually savemore when the  rate of  return goes up has been  lacking.  We have  triedall  sorts  of  experiments  through the  tax system and through raisinginterest  rates  and through all  sorts  of  other  things,  and we have notseen  clear evidence  that  people  save more.  So,  I think we  should bereally humble about  alleging that  there  are big  advantages  to be7/2-3/96-62-gained through the  saving rate  in squeezing  out the  last  bit  ofinflation.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I think  I've  lost my train of  thought here![Laughter]I am going  to be very brief.  I agree with Ed Boehne  that  itwould be useful  to  state our goal  in  terms  of  maximum sustainablegrowth  and the notion  of  trying to achieve price stability.  It  seemsto  me that while we  can set  2 percent  or maybe  something else as  aninflation goal,  I am a little skeptical  that  any one measure  ofinflation  is  the  right one.  At any point  in  time,  I can imagine  thatthere will be problems with a particular measure, as  there are nowwith  the CPI.  Intuitively, I am attracted to  the notion of  the  GDPdeflator,  but I will  admit  that  it  too may have problems at  times.There may be unusual  circumstances  affecting  the various  measures,  soI am hesitant to pin down  a particular  number.  I am a little morecomfortable with the notion of  a range, but  I think it might be usefulto  continue  to  state our goal  in words  as  opposed to  numbers  and thengive examples of  what we  see as price  stability at  a particular pointin time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey, you have a question?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  No,  I heard the word tax again.  [Laughter]You have  the right  to  tell  me to  shut  up, but  I will  otherwisepersist.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  You did not  hear the  word taxes coming fromme,  Larry.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  No.  It  is  true that  the  economics  literaturedoes not  show a correlation  between the  real  after-tax return onsavings  and the  rate  of  savings.  However,  in  the  example  I gave7/2-3/96-63-before, 3 percent  inflation and a 2 percent  real  return converts a 30percent  tax rate  on  savings  to  an  80  percent  tax  rate  on  savings.  Nosensible person would recommend that  as  a sane policy.  That's notbecause  of  this  elasticity with respect  to  growth, but  because it  isdistorting  and unfair within the  tax  system.  What  it  does  is  toinduce  people  to  "save"  in  other  forms  that  are  quasi-consumptionoriented,  which causes  an untaxed stream of  benefits.  Now, given thatthey do  all  that--hold more  "saving" in  the  form of more  jewelry, moreland, more housing, rather than  financial  assets--that is  a verydifferent  proposition.  I see everyone  shaking  their heads  that theyagree with me;  maybe that  is  to encourage  me  to be quiet.  [Laughter]I will  take  it  as  assent with my point  that what  you measured as  theelasticity is  not  the  "be all  and end  all"  of  policy here.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Even  if  there is  no  change,  it  is  still  unfair  ifsavers are  forced to  accept that  lower rate  of  return.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It  is  still  unfair.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can  I switch the  subject?  Since we havenow all  agreed on  2 percent, my question is,  what  2 percent?  Let mepresent  the  issue  more specifically.  You can ask the  question, whatis  the  inflation rate  as  appropriately measured, which implies  that wecan measure  it.  Or you can ask what  is  the  appropriate  inflationindicator  that we  should focus  on, recognizing that  it  is notappropriately measured and has  various  biases.There are  three  fundamentals here.  We can  continue  to  usethe consumer price  index as  we have done  over the  years  and  in myjudgment  increasingly inaccurately.  I think  that  is potentially verydisadvantageous  for us  from a policy standpoint.  The  consumer priceindex is  flawed with respect  to  the biases  that  are  in it  on acontinuing basis,  although it  is  evident  that very significantimprovements  can be  made and indeed are being made  by the Bureau ofEconomic Analysis.  Clearly, as  Roberts pointed out,  the  PCE  chain-weighted index, whether excluding  or  including  the  energy and  foodcomponents,  is  unquestionably  far  superior as  a measure of  the  realconsumer inflation  rate,  including the biases.Alternatively, we can  go  further  and ask, why not use  thegross domestic  purchases  inflation  measure?  Here  again we have theproblem of  chain  estimates that  are  superior to previous  estimatesthat used the  implicit  deflator as  a meaningful  indicator, which itwas not.  Here we have  the  question of what to  do  about  imports.  Whenwe endeavor  to  focus  on a price, should we be  concerned about  theprice of  imports?  I will  put  it  another way:  Do  we wish to use thegross  domestic purchases  index,  with or  without  food and  energy?  Ita very significant  consideration because, in  the  current environment,prices of  producers  durable  equipment  are  falling.  We do not  quitemeasure it  that way and our  indexes do  not  quite come  out  that way.However, it  is  apparent  that even as  badly as  we measure  it,  usingprices of  producers  durable  equipment  as  a proxy for consumer pricesclearly  is  not  in  the appropriate  lexicon.  Since we have  already cometo a major  conclusion, I will  ask, what  in the world are we  talkingabout?  If  anyone would like  to address  that  issue, be my guest.7/2-3/96-64-

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  It  seems to  me  that when Janet and Al weretalking, they had implicit  in their minds  something like a CPI or  coreCPI.  They were able to  generate  some  consensus or  agreement  about  thedesirability  of  reducing the  rate  of  CPI  inflation  from its  currentlevel  of  about  3 percent down  to  2 percent.  That  is  the  criticalpoint.  If  one wants  to  focus  on  a different  index, let  the  staff makea suggestion and maybe we will  start  out with an  inflation  rate of,say, 2 percent  and  go  down to  1 percent.  I do  not  think that  is  thecritical  issue.  I think the  critical  issue  is  --

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I think you have missed the point.  They were nottalking about  that.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  But  the  PCE  is  clearly a superior measure.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That's  fine.  Then we  will  start  with 2 percentinflation and go  to  1 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  We know that  there  is  a measurement  issue.  Letus  say that  the PCE has  less  of  a measurement bias but not  a zeromeasurement bias.  It  may be 1/2  percentage point;  it  may be  apercentage point, and you still  have  the  issues  of  the permanenttradeoff  that  Governor Yellen talked about.  I do not  know that  youcan say that  you should go  from  2 percent  to  1 percent.  Maybe  2percent  inflation  as measured by the  PCE  is where you want to  be.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  If  you want  to  change the  measure, you have  tochange the  numbers.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  We also  are not  talking about  going from 2percent  to  1 percent  overnight or  in  the context  of  the next  fewmonths.  We  are  talking about making a change toward lower  inflation,however we are measuring  it,  using whatever measure.  We are moving inthe direction of  lower  inflation over  a period of  time to  the  extentthat  that  is  consistent with  the maintenance  of  favorable  conditionsin  the  economy overall.7/2-3/96-65-

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  But we  get back to  the  issue of  whether  inflationcan be  too  low as well  as  too  high.  We have to  take up  that point.What are  the  benefits  of  a percentage point  reduction  in  inflation,given that  it  is  already  2 percent?  Those  are the  things we have toweigh.

MR. PARRY.  So, you did not agree with  the  consensus  thatthey reached?

MS. YELLEN.  I am  sorry.  I agree with Governor Meyer andwould support  the  statements he has  made.  I regret  that  I have notthought  through  this measurement  issue carefully,  and so  you shouldnot  take my 3 percent and 2 percent  inflation numbers  as necessarilyfocusing on  the CPI.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I submit  that we  do not  really need tountil  we get  to  the  question of whether  our  goal  is  2 percent.  Twopercent  of what?  It  is  a perfectly credible  argument  to  say, whateverthe  inflation rate  is  now, that  it  should be  lower.  That  is  anunambiguous  statement.  Members  can  have  their own particular measureand say,  I  think it  is  4,  I want  to  go  to  3 or  I think  it  is  1, itshould go  to  zero.  Everyone  is  in  agreement with  that.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Instead of  choosing,  let's  use  all  of  them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  you put  a number  down,  the  questioninevitably  is  raised as  to  what you are  talking about unless you wanta  Jesuitical  solution that  bypasses the  whole question.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  My view is  that  we  could make acontribution to  the  societal debate by  figuring  out what  the bestinflation measurement  is.  If  it  is  not  the  CPI,  we  should  decide whatwe  think  it  is.  It  will not  be perfect,  but  if  we can determine  whatis  the  best  one,  then we  ought  to  sell  that  as  the  inflation ratepeople  ought  to  be  looking at.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  is  another element  that  has  notbeen raised and  that  is  the  question, what  is  the  real  federal  fundsrate?  In principle,  we  should  be deflating  the  federal  funds  rate,  tothe  extent  that  we  think of  it  in real  terms,  by the  same  price  indexwe would want  to  use  to  determine when we  are getting  to  stableprices.  This  matters  because, as  I will  tell  you  tomorrow, theimportantly a  function of which measure  is  used.  The decline  canrange  from  0 to  50  basis points,  and that  is  a big deal.  It matters.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Another big deal would  seem to  be, though,  thatif  we want  to  calculate  the  real  funds  rate  or something  like  thatwith a different price variable, we  need a time  series  to  put  it  inperspective.  It  is  not  just how it  has performed over the  last  coupleof  quarters, but where  it  stands  relative  to  history.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Absolutely.  We need a  time  series.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Exactly.  It  seems  to  me  that  there  is  anotherissue we  have  to  think  a  little about,  and this  is  not  a defense  ofthe CPI.  My guess  is  that  to  the  extent  that  labor  contracts,7/2-3/96-66-government pensions,  and the  like  are actually  indexed to  something,they are  indexed to  the CPI  or  some  variant of  the CPI.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  cost-of-living escalator in  laborcontracts  is  rapidly becoming obsolescent.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I understand that,  but  there  is  still  some ofthat  around.  The  social  security cost-of-living measure  still  usesthe  CPI,  I believe.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me put  it  this  way.  I think  thereis  a growing consensus  that using the  CPI  on  all  the governmentprograms  is  something  that we  should veer away from.  If we were  to  goto  the  gross  domestic purchases  price  index or  something like  that,  itwould not  change  the  world, but  I will  bet  that  it would have someeffect on this  sort  of  discussion.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  No, I was  not  trying to  defend the  CPI.  I wastrying  to acknowledge  that  it  has  an institutional  role.  It may notbe as  important as  it  once was,  but  it  is  still  there.  It may havesomething  to  do with the  estimates  that  Janet  cited about what  thePhillips  curve is  like  if  inflation  is  at  a very low level  becausesome  of  the  institutions  are tied  into  the CPI.  That  is  my point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree with you.  I think they are.Fortunately, I don't think there  is  a large number of  them with theexception of  the  federal  government.  The  CPI  is  a diminishingelement.  Thirty to  forty years  ago,  it  was  sacrosanct.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Could I follow up on  that?  If wecome  to  a conclusion as  to what we  think  is  the  right inflation rateand, going back  to  Governor Yellen's presentation,  it  turns  out  to  bea rate  where 33  percent  of  the  firms  in  the  country have  to  forcenominal wage  reductions,  it  will not  fly.  The American people  willnot  find  it  acceptable.  It  will not be  something that  the centralbank can  live with over an  extended period of  time because  it  islikely  that either other people with different views would be  takingour  seats  or  our  responsibility would be transferred to  an institutionthat  the  people  found more  sympathetic.  So,  I think the  inflationnumber  that we will  find  acceptable will never be  zero.  It  will besome  number above  zero,  hopefully better  measured than  it  is  now.  Ithink we  also  should rely  less  on  our  instinctive  reactions  and seekto  quantify better  that deflation  is  truly a bad thing, not justbecause  it  sounds bad but  because  of  the  very real  costs  that  itimposes  on  the economy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  there  is  a problem  in  that wheninflation  is  up  to  5, 7, or  10  percent, people  have an implicit viewthat  there  is  a floor below which  inflation cannot  go.  It  is  theissue of  nominal  interest  rates.  People  look  at nominal  interestrates  and say,  if  they are down to  1 percent,  get  them as  close  tozero  as  possible.  No one  ever  suggests  getting nominal  interest ratesto minus 2 percent.  But  I do not  think people  are  aware that  there  isno  sound barrier at  zero.  First  of  all,  people  do not know when weare  there.  There  is  nothing visible as  a signpost when we go  throughzero and into  deflation.  That  therefore makes  it  a very difficultissue.7/2-3/96-67-My own view, as  I have stated many times,  is  that  our goalshould be  price stability.  But  I do not  think we  should have a naiveview as  to what  is  required to  get  there or  what  it  means when we getthere  and what we  do when it  is no  longer rhetoric but  action that weneed to  maintain it.  I believe  that we underestimate  the productivityeffects  that  occur  at  those  levels.  The  analogy would be  that  as  aparticle moves  to  the  speed  of  light,  its mass  changes.  My own view,which  is probably going to be  determined to  be correct  eventually--  inthe year  2252--[Laughter]  is  that  as  the  inflation rate goes  down, thetendency for nominal  wages not  to  come  down will  enforce cost-cuttingimprovements  and  technological changes.  It  is  not that  low or  stableprices  are an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  capital  investment toreduce  costs, but  rather that  it  is  an  environment  that  forcesproductivity enhancements.  It  forces people who want to  stay  inbusiness  to  take  those  actions--such as  cutting down the  size  of  thecafeteria, reducing overtime,  and taking away managers' drivers--thatthey did not want  to  take before  in  the  ordinary course of  business  ina modest  inflationary environment because  it was  easier then  just  toraise prices  to  maintain margins.  If you  force  the price  level down,you induce real  reallocations  of resources  because  to  stay  in businessfirms  have  to  achieve  real  as distinct  from nominal efficiencies.That phenomenon  is  what price  stability means  to  me, and I see  it  as  avery complex issue.  When we  first talked  about  it  in  the  context  of  a10  percent  or so  rate  of  inflation, we  could just  have an  academicdiscussion.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Sure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But now we  are  getting there  and thequestion  is  basically whether we are  willing to move  on to  pricestability.  The question really is  whether we as  an institution  canmake  the unilateral  decision to do  that.  I agree with you, Mr. ViceChairman.  I think  that  this  is  a very  fundamental  question  for  thissociety.  We can go up  to  the Hill  and testify in  favor  of  it;  we  canmake  speeches  and proselytize  as much  as we want.  I think the  type  ofchoice  is  so  fundamental  to  a society that  in a democratic  society weas  unelected officials  do not have  the  right to make' that  decision.Indeed,  if we tried to,  we would  find that  our mandate would getremarkably altered.Let me  ask  just  one  quick question that  relates  to  thisissue.  It relates  to  the  question of  the gross  domestic purchasesindex versus  the  GDP deflator.  How would we wish to  respond  if  oilprices  doubled?  If  oil  prices doubled  and the United States werefully self-sufficient  in crude,  then  this question would not  come up.Assume  that we are  effectively out  of  domestic crude  and the oil  pricedoubles.  The effect would be  that, unlike  the  GDP deflator,  the grossdomestic purchases  index would veer very dramatically.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But it  is  a level  change, not  a permanentincrease.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  take  a look at  the Greenbook.  Inthe  first  quarter  of  1997,  the  GDP deflator goes  up  .1 percent  fromthe  fourth  quarter  of  1996.  The gross  domestic purchases  index goesup by  .7 or  .8 percent because  we have  an assumption of  a significantrise  in crude  oil prices  at  the beginning  of  the  year.7/2-3/96-68-

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  What happens  in  the  second quarter?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  not relevant.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Right,  that  is  the point.  That  is  what  Imeant by a level  change.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But  supposing the price level  goes upagain in the  second quarter and up  again in  the  third?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That  would require  a constant acceleration  inoil  prices.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  sure.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  With feedback.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  How do we  respond  to that?  The  GDPdeflator is  2 percent.  I can create  a scenario where the GDP deflatoris  2 percent  and the  gross  domestic purchases  index is  5 percent.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  It  would eventually work its  way into  GDP atsome point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Over  the  long run,  oil prices  would worktheir way through but never  fully.  That's because  there would be asignificant  shift  to domestic  natural  gas.  The economy would go backto using more  coal,  and we would have much smaller cars.  So,  thehigher  oil prices  would filter  through only partly.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  But focusing  on GDP, you are still  going to  beaddressing the question of  an external  oil  shock.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  That  is  a relevant  issue.  It  isnot  a hypothetical question.  You are  talking about  a 2 percentinflation goal.  What do you do  in  this  situation?

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Hasn't all  the  discussion allowed  for  takingshocks  to  the  system  into account?  It  is  not  that we wouldimmediately  react dramatically to  bring down the  rate  of  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But  there are different  types of  shocks,and there are  all of  these  different  alternatives.  At this  point Iwill merely suggest  that we adjourn.  It  is  6:31 p.m.  We actuallyhave made  far more progress  today than any remote expectation I had.We will  reconvene at  9:00  a.m. tomorrow.[Meeting  recessed]7/2-3/96-69-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We will  now discuss  the  long-term rangesof  the monetary  aggregates,  and  I will call  on  Dave  Lindsey.MR. D.  LINDSEY.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions  for  David?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  How much tighter  is  the  tighter  alternative?MR.  D. LINDSEY.  A  quarter point  increase  for the  next  fourFOMC  meetings,  so  an upward adjustment  of  100  basis points  by year-end.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  I want  to  ask  a question about  the  simulations  inBluebook Charts  2 and 3.  They have  interest  rate  implications  thatcan  affect  the  growth  of  the  aggregates  over  the  long  term.  PCEinflation has averaged  about 2-1/2  percent  in the  last  two years,  andit  was  as  low as  2.1  percent  in  the  last  four quarters.  Thesimulations  you  ran allowed the  PCE to  get up to  3 percent.  Is  thatconsistent with holding the  line  on  inflation in  an opportunisticapproach?  It  seems  to  me  that  if you were assuming an  opportunisticapproach, you would have  taken  something like  2-1/2  percent  or  2.1percent and your decision rule  would have been to  keep  it  at  thatlevel.  Your  assumption does  not  seem consistent with being eitherdeliberate  or opportunistic.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  When we designed  this,  we had to  design  it  aroundthe Greenbook  forecast,  which already had  some uptick in  inflation.Our  design process  was  to  level  out  the  PCE  and not allow it  to  riseany  further.  In  the baseline  run,  the  solid  line reflects  the  fedfunds rate  assumption  in the  Greenbook and then  shows  what  tighteninghas  to be  implemented at  the  end  of  the  forecast horizon  to  stopinflation  from rising perceptibly further.  The  other simulation  doesstart  the  tightening earlier and  levels  out  the  inflation  rate alittle  sooner.  But you  are  right;  in both cases,  the  smallacceleration  in  PCE inflation  that  is  in  the  Greenbook  stays  in  forthe  most part.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  It  really gives  one  the  impression  that  holdingthe  line  on  inflation  is  a relatively painless  process when  in  factholding the  line on  inflation  truly may be very painful.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  In  order to  bring  inflation back  down to  2-1/2percent, we would need at  least  the beginnings  of  a tighter policy.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  David, John Carlson on my staff has  been doingsome  work with MZM  [Money with  Zero Maturity];  have you  looked  at  thatrecently?7/2-3/96-70-

[SECTION]

MR. D. LINDSEY.  Yes,  I looked  at the  chart  that  I got  fromhim yesterday.  We  have done a little work on  MZM.  That  chart and ourearlier work do not  show anything like the  breakdown in  the  velocity/opportunity cost  relationship  that  has  occurred for M2  in  the  1990s.On the  other hand, judging by that  chart and  the  econometric work wehave done, MZM has  a rather  substantial  sensitivity to movements  inshort-term  interest rates  and thus  opportunity  costs.  Therefore,  itdoes  not recommend itself as  an  intermediate guide  to  policy.  Theexample  I like  to  think of  in  this  regard is  that  if  nominal  spendingstarts  to  drift up  sufficiently to  cause  a problem with  inflationaryacceleration and the Federal  Reserve  tightens  a little,  the  resultcould be  to  drive the  growth rate  of  a very interest-sensitiveaggregate back down at  the same  time  that nominal  GDP is  stillspurting ahead.  Inflation could get  out of  control by insufficient,gradual  increases  in  short-term rates even though we would be  keepingthis  interest-sensitive  aggregate  well within  a range.  This  is  aproblem  that harkens  back to the  situation that  developed with M1after  the  introduction  of  super NOWs  in  the  early 1980s.  Indeed,  Ithink  the  fundamental  reason why the Committee  deemphasized the  Mlaggregate was  that  it  had become  too  interest  sensitive to  be of useas  a normal intermediate  target.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I think your analysis  is  right  about  the dangersof  using MZM  if  something causes  an acceleration of  inflation  so  thatwe  get  a misreading of  what  that  indicator is  telling us.  But  it  issomewhat  less  interest  sensitive  than the  old M1.  We have  the problemof  sweep  accounts with  the M1  measure that we do  not have with MZM.So,  I would suggest that  you drop the Ml  measure, continue  to producethe  charts and the  opportunity costs  because it will  get more  and moredifficult  to make sense  out  of  these  sweep adjustments,  substituteMZM, pay attention to  it,  and let  us  see  how it  behaves  over  time.Its opportunity-cost  relationship  is  strikingly tight.

[SECTION]

MR. D. LINDSEY.  Yes.  I am  somewhat  sympathetic  to  thatsuggestion.  Obviously, we do not  currently target Ml;  we do  notcurrently put much weight on  it.  Clearly, the  sweep-account problem,which  involves  these  adjustments  only for the  initial  sweeps,  ismaking  it  more and more  difficult  over  time  to  have confidence  in Ml,even  after  sweep adjustments.  I am a little sympathetic  to  that  idea.I will  not speak  for my division director, however.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We will  assume that  you just  did!  Anyfurther questions  for  David?  Before  we go  around the  room, let  mejust  repeat what  the structure  of  the  discussion was when we  looked atthis  issue back in  February.  I must  compliment the  staff  forindicating then that growth  of  the broader  aggregates  was  likely torun  at  the  upper  end of  the ranges  that we chose,  and, indeed,  that  isprecisely what  happened.  Therefore,  I think we  can have confidencethat such  growth will  continue  as  the  staff  suggests.  The  crucialissue  that  I think is  confronting us,  to repeat what  I said  lastscratch in a wholly analytical  environment.  It makes  very littlesense  to  choose  a range  in which expected M2  growth remains  in theupper half  of  the range.  One would presume  that we wouldautomatically  adjust  the range up  a notch  to  surround the  staffforecast.7/2-3/96-71-In my judgment,  were we  to  do  that,  we would be signalingthat M2  is  back  in the  ball game.  But more  importantly,  I think wewould be  signaling an element  of  acceptance  of  inflationary forces.That  is  not what we would intend, but  it would be  interpreted by someas  conveying that meaning.  At  the  moment, despite  the  evidence thatDavid Lindsey produced suggesting,  I think with  some reasonableness,that M2  is  beginning  to  look  like  a useful  indicator once  again, wehave not  said  that publicly.  We  have  in no  way indicated  that we havetaken M2  out  of  the  deep recesses  of  the  statistical  dungeon in whichwe have placed it.  I am concerned that  we would gain very little  instirring  the pot  at  this  stage.  Were  there a reasonable expectationthat M2  would run well  above  the ranges,  then  I think we would need tohave another  type  of  discussion.  As  far as  I can  see,  we need to havesome very strong reasons  to  deviate  from  a range that  we presume wouldencompass  the  type  of  M2  growth we would expect  in the  event  that  weever reached  the nirvana of  a stable price level.  Frankly, I wouldcaution  against stirring the  pot at  this  stage  even  though thearguments  that  will be made  are unquestionably appropriate, namely,that  it  makes no  sense purposely to  set  a range knowing  full well  thatthe  actual  tracking of M2  is  highly likely to remain around  its  upperlimit.  To my knowledge,  no  one  has  commented on  that  fact  since weadopted  the range  in  late January.  Were we to  change  the  range, wewould raise potentially a new set  of  concerns,  a new set  of  indicatorsto measure Fed behavior, and a new view of  an  FOMC less  interested inconstraining  inflation.  All  in all,  I cannot  say that  I am  intriguedby the  thought  of  changing what  we did last  January.  That  is  a deep-seated prejudice  that  I have decided to  expose!  [Laughter]  GovernorLindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman, even  though you did not  utter  theword  "tax,"  I am going  to  respectfully disagree.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With respect  to  tax  policy?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  If  you had uttered the word  "tax,"  I probablywould have  disagreed disrespectfully or  something.As  you stated, Mr. Chairman, we  set  a range  that we  thoughtwas  going to be  consistent with our  intermediate- or  longer-runtargets  for  inflation.  The number  that  I heard yesterday was  2percent  inflation  as  an  interim target.  The  number that  I heard onexpected growth was  2 percent.  And 2 plus 2 equals  4.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Only in  a nongraduated income  taxstructure!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That  is  probably true.  The  first  considerationis  that  the midpoint  of  the Alternative  II  range  is  4, and that  rangeis  therefore  consistent  with  our stated purpose  in  setting a range.Second, even  though there may be an argument  over what  the word"tighter" means  in  the  shorter  run, if  we tighten  100  basis pointsthis year,  M2  growth will  still  be near  the upper end of  theAlternative I range.  Next year, it  would fall  to  the  middle of  therange under a policy  that we would all  acknowledge  to  be  "tighter."The word  "tighter,"  if  translated into a monetary aggregate, means  tome  that we  are  running our monetary aggregate below a normal ratebecause we  are  deliberately trying to  disinflate.  Under the  tighter7/2-3/96scenario,  our nominal GDP  is  not 2 and 2.  It  is  2 and 1-1/2  orsomething like  that.I also disagree about  how perceptions would be affected.Frankly, I do  not  think that  there  is  any perception out  there  that  weare aggressively easing policy.  I do  not think  that  is  true  in  thebond market.  The  risks  in that  direction may have  existed in  thepast, but  I do not  think they exist now.  With regard  to  why we wouldbe raising  the range,  the  answer  is  that  it  is  a technicalreadjustment  just  like M3  was  last July.  In your  testimony, you  canstate that, Mr. Chairman.  No  one  here  is  arguing  that  M2  shouldbecome  the  pinnacle of monetary policy again.  We  are reporting  theseranges  only because it  is  required by law.  Because  it  is  required bylaw, we have  a moral  responsibility to  report a range  that  isreasonable and consistent with what we  actually are going  to  end upwith.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Incidentally, before we go  forward,Governor Lindsey referred to  a matter  that  reminded me  how veryimportant  it  is  for  all  of  us  to  recognize  the highly confidentialnature  of what we  talk about  at  an  FOMC  meeting.  We  all  have  seensome  evidence recently of Fed officials  mentioning what  the Committeewas going  to  do  or what  was being  said at  our  meetings.  There waseven a rumor of  what  somebody thought  somebody else  thought  that  Ithought!  That  sort  of  thing serves  us  very poorly.  The  discussion wehad yesterday was  exceptionally interesting and important.  I willtell you  that if  the  2 percent  inflation  figure  gets  out of  this room,it  is  going to  create  more problems  for  us  than  I think any of  youmight anticipate.  I beseech you all,  especially those of  you who havenot heard this speech before--and there are a number  in  this  room whohave not--to realize  that  it  is  very damaging to  this  institution whenanybody conveys  information  from inside  the  System concerning whatmembers of  this  group  are  thinking or what  the FOMC  is  likely to do.You are  all  free  to  indicate what you  think the  economy  isdoing.  You have  the  right -- but  I would suggest  not  exercising  it  --to  indicate how you are going to vote.  That  is  a bad idea,  but youcertainly have the  right  to  do  it.  What you do not have  the  right  todo  is  to  talk for  the Committee.  No one  has  that  right.  I do nothave  that right.  Certainly, to  do  so  is  a major  disservice to  thisinstitution, and  I ask you  in the  strongest terms  to  remember who hasFOMC clearance  when you discuss  FOMC  matters.  Most of  our  leaks,  asbest  I can judge,  occur when somebody in  this  room speaks to  somebodyelse at  their Banks  or  in  other  institutions,  and it  is  they who  leakto  the press.  My  impression  is  that  security in  this  room  is  goodwith respect  to direct  access to  the meeting.  What happens  is  thatyou go home  and you tell  somebody, who  does not  have FOMC  clearance,that  it  was an  interesting meeting.  That person, who may be on thestaff at  a fairly high level,  tells  somebody else  that  it  was aninteresting meeting  and guess  what?  That  is  the  type  of  thing thatyou have  to  avoid.  I am  sorry to  interrupt our  discussion at  thispoint, but  it was precisely Governor Lindsey's  allusion to  the  2percent  that  triggered my concern about  this.  So,  please keep  thisin mind.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I agree with your initial  remarkabout the message  that would be  sent by  changing the  ranges  and to methat  consideration  dominates.  But with regard  to  the  substance  of  the7/2-3/96-73-ranges  that we  announce  and any  information content  they may have, weknow that  the  lags are  fairly long.  It  is  not  just  1997  that we needto be  thinking about,  though that  is  what we have  to  announce, but1998  and later.  If  evidence  should emerge that  the  velocity of M2  isstabilizing  at  essentially  a zero drift  or  trend, we would then wantto  cap nominal  income  growth.  In Governor Lindsey's  2 plus  2 example,would we want  to  be considering a world in which nominal  spendingrises  faster  than 5 percent?  I do not  think so.  I think holding therange  at  1 to  5 percent  sends  the message that we  are capping  totalspending growth at no more  than  5 percent, allowing for the realgrowth  in productivity and making certain that  inflation  is  still  on adownward trend.  So,  I think  it  would a mistake  to  shift  from thecurrent  1 to  5 percent  range.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan, I agree with what you have  suggested.  Ido not want  to prejudge  the outcome of  this meeting, but  it  ispossible that we will  not  take  any action with regard to  our short-run policy.  In  that event,  I would not want  to  take  any action withregard to  these ranges.  As you suggested, that might lead people tomisconstrue the  posture  of  this  Committee with  respect  to  inflation.So,  I think it makes  sense  to leave  the M2  range  unchanged.  The otherthing I would say is  that,  even  though  these aggregates have been onthe bench for a while, I do not  believe we can  afford  to  ignore themtotally over  longer periods  of  time.  One  of  the problems  is  that  evenif we move to  some sort  of  inflation target,  we have  to be veryforward-looking  in that  regard.  In other words,  our actions  probablyhave  their impact  on inflation with a one-  to  two-year lag,  and Ithink monetary aggregates  can be very useful  interim guides,  not  frommeeting  to meeting  but over longer periods  of  time.  So,  I believethere  is  a policy  role for  the monetary aggregates  once we are  surethat  velocity relationships have stabilized.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, if we were  startingout  from scratch  I would be  in favor of  Governor Lindsey's position.But we are  not starting  out  from scratch,  and as  you suggested themessage  likely to  be given by a change  in the  ranges would be anunfortunate  one.  We also have  to  live with the  other  issue  thatGovernor Lindsey very correctly mentioned, which  is  that  we have astatute  that we are  supposed to  be  observing.  Therefore, I think onewould assume and hope  that,  in presenting the  ranges,  you would repeatsomething along the  lines  of your statement  in  February to  make itclear  that  the aggregates  are  likely to  grow at rates  around  the upperends  of  their ranges.  Another  reason why I would  like  to  retain thecurrent  ranges  is  that  a change would be  likely to  take on animportance far beyond its merit  and divert attention  from what  I hopewill be  the main message of  your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony.  Thatmessage is  that price stability is  not  an enemy of  growth.  Thecontrary notion is  far too much alive  in  the  land, and so  it  is veryimportant  for us  to  confront  that  issue  head on.  I would not wantanything,  including  specifically a change in  the  ranges,  to  create  adiversion and have people focusing  on  that rather  than on  the  reallyimportant  issue,  which is  that price stability  is  the way that weachieve  sustained economic  growth and  is  in no  way the  enemy of suchgrowth.7/2-3/96-74-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I agree fully with Governor Lindsey's  reasoningon this  along with his  assessment of  the  likely consequences  of  sayingthat we have made  a technical  adjustment.  I would certainly  grantthat  our Humphrey-Hawkins  report has  honestly stated  that  the rangesin Alternative  I encompass  the Committee's  expectation for  growth ofM2  under conditions of  price stability,  and we  said in  the report  thatwe thought M2  growth would be near  the  upper end of  the  range.  Allthat  is  true.  But what we  are required to  do,  as  the  Bluebook notes,is  to  communicate  to Congress  our objectives  and plans  for growth ofthe  aggregates  for  the  calendar year,  taking  account of  past andprospective  developments in  employment, prices,  and other factors.The  latter do  not  include what  we view as  the  likely ranges  underconditions  of price  stability.  My sense is  that  this  is  not a bigdeal.  I think we  should simply  do what we were asked to  do  in  theHumphrey-Hawkins legislation.  We would say  that we are making atechnical  adjustment;  we made  a technical  adjustment to  M3  in July oflast year.  I would note,  incidentally,  that  I have dissented twicebefore on  this  issue;  Governor Lindsey has  dissented once.  No one,not  even a reporter, has  ever  called me  to ask whether  there was  adeep monetary policy disagreement  among  the FOMC members  or  whether wehad lost  our  commitment  to price  stability.  I have never heard oneword from  any reporter about this.  I have  said that  I dissented for atechnical  reason and the boredom factor  set  in  so rapidly that no  onewanted to hear another word about it.  I believe  that  is  what wouldhappen now.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree  strongly with yourrecommendation and for  the  reasons you  stated.  As  I mentionedyesterday, I think monetary policy has  to have  some  long-term anchor.In  the  absence  of an  explicit inflation  target,  I see  the need tomaintain this  range, which is  centered around the longer-term  rate  ofM2  growth that we  think is  consistent with price  stability andsustainable  economic growth.  This  is  a substitute.  It  is  not aperfect  substitute, but  I think it  is  a better  substitute  than  thehigher range.  So,  I feel  strongly that we  should maintain  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, I would join those who argue thatthe risk  of  an unintended  signal effect  from  a change  at  this  time,even  though the probability may be very low, is  a risk we  just do  notneed to  take.  At  least  for  the moment,  that  argument substantiallyoutweighs  in my view the argument for  a technical  adjustment.  So,  Iwould support  leaving the ranges where  they are.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I agree with those who  think that  the  case  forleaving the ranges unchanged at  this  point  is  a strong one.  I7/2-3/96-75-certainly would welcome  renewed usefulness  of M2,  but  I do not  thinkthe  evidence,  while  it may be encouraging, is  sufficient yet.  As  aconsequence,  I don't  think we  ought  to raise  its profile  orprominence.  We  are not getting  any questions  about growth around  thetop  of  the ranges,  and  there  is  something  to be  said for  lettingsleeping dogs  lie.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I agree with your recommendationand with the  way Gary Stern phrased it.  I think there  is  a seriousrisk  that  increasing the ranges would be misinterpreted, primarilybecause  of what we have  done in  the past.  Since we have  not changedthem  in the past under  similar circumstances, why would we  suddenlywant  to  do  so now?  Another point is  that,  after our very importantdiscussion yesterday about  longer-term objectives  for  core inflation,the time  to  change  these  ranges, if  we are  going  to do  that,  is  whenwe  have  a better  idea  of what policy we are  going to propose in  termsof  our  longer-term objectives on  inflation.  We may want  to  go  to  theCongress,  as  was  suggested yesterday,  for  that  type  of  discussion,  andI personally think we  should.  It  just  seems  to me  that  theappropriate  time  to  change  these ranges would be when we  have  a betteridea  of what  our  longer-term objectives on  inflation are  going  to beand how we are  going to present that  to the American people.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think one  can argue  this  issue  either way.  Itis  not an  issue  that  elicits  strong feelings  on my part  one way or  theother.  On balance, I would prefer  to  keep the  ranges  as  they  are.  Myprimary reason is  that  you are the  spokesman  for  the  Committee;  youare  the  one who  has  to present  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony.  If  youfeel  more comfortable with the  approach you recommended, I am preparedto  support  it.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly support yourrecommendation for  the reasons you stated and  those that werementioned by  others.  However, I would  like  to  make an  additionalpoint.  I think we ought  to keep  in mind that  the projections that  wehave here  are staff projections  based upon the  staff's baselineeconomic  forecast.  Quite  frankly, I think that  it  is not  the bestforecast  for  the next  two  years.  As  the next  two years unfold,  Iwould  expect  to  see a rise  in  interest rates  and in  that event  thegrowth of  the  aggregates  is  likely to be  less.  So,  I think the  ideathat  higher ranges are more  consistent  with everyone's  forecast  is  amistake  in  the  first place.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I agree with your suggestion that  we not  changethe  ranges  and only partly because  I think a change might give  thewrong  impression.  Raising a range  because our projection is  a littlehigher  is  a little  like  drawing a target around the  bullet hole  in  thewall.  I think we  ought  to  take the  M2  range  fairly seriously, beconcerned  if  there  is  a prolonged period of M2  growth above  5 percent,7/2-3/96-76-and not  forget about  this  aggregate  as a potential signal  for us  to  dosomething.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman, I am uncomfortable with the  currentprocedure  embodied in Alternative  I for  setting  the  target ranges  ofM2  and M3,  particularly M2  in this  discussion.  It  seems  to me  thatthis  approach is  quite  inconsistent with the  spirit and the letter  ofHumphrey-Hawkins.  I believe  it  also  differs  from the publicperception of  the logic underlying those  ranges  among even therelatively well-informed Fed watchers in  the private  sector.  I thinkit  fails  totally  in  communicating policy intent.  Many believe that  weare  trapped here  and they  fear  the  loss  of  credibility that,  theyassume, would follow the  upward adjustment  of  the  target  ranges  thatis  required to make  them consistent  with both the  staff  forecast  andthe  spirit of  Humphrey-Hawkins.  Now, in commenting on that,  myparticular approach may be  sharper than  I intend, but  it  seems  to methat  it  is  like  trying  to use bad policy to compensate  for badcommunication.  What  I mean is  that  if  we are worried aboutcommunicating policy intent  to  the public, we have a lot  ofopportunities  to do  that  in testimony, speeches,  and otherwise  and weought  to do  that.  I do not  feel  that we ought  to  compensate for  ourinability to  communicate effectively by setting  target ranges  that areso  inconsistent,  or  that are at  least mildly inconsistent, with thestaff  or our  Humphrey-Hawkins  forecasts.Now, I am uncomfortable  about  maintaining indefinitely what  Iconsider to  be  a ruse, and  I think at  some point we will  probablyregret  it.  At  this  time,  however, I am going  to defer to  the  judgmentof  the  Chairman, but  I hope that  between now and the  next time  I haveto vote  on  this  issue, we will  find  some means  to improve  the way thatwe handle  the monetary growth ranges.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I, too,  am  in  favor of your  recommendation, Mr.Chairman, for many of  the reasons  that have  been expressed around thetable.  I think  it  is  a communication  device.  With only a fewtechnical  exceptions,  all  the  changes we have made  in  the  ranges  overthe years  have been to reduce  them consistent with our objective  offostering progress  toward  stable prices.  At  this point,  I thinkkeeping  the M2  range where it  is  will  send the message  that we want  tosend concerning  our reasonably near-term objectives relating  to pricestability.

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, I have no  strong  feeling about  theranges  themselves, but I do  feel  strongly that  the management  of  theissue is  important.  In  that sense,  I strongly support yourrecommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  It  is. certainly premature to  restore M2  and M3to  their  full  status as policy  indicators,  but I do  think  that weshould  recognize that  they are performing a bit better in  terms  of7/2-3/96-77-velocity and GDP growth.  I thought  David Lindsey's chart presentationwas  extremely useful,  and I particularly liked  the  first  chart  thatshows  the  upward migration  in M2  velocity.  I thought that was  veryhelpful.  But  it  also points  out  that we  do not  yet have a lot  of  dotsalong that  green  line  for  the period since  the  start  of  1994,  whilethere are  a lot  of  dots  around the  black line  for  the period  from  1960to  1989.  I thought  that  chart put  the recent  history intoperspective.  But  I do  think  that money remains  an  important monitorfor monetary policy, and I believe  it  would be  useful in  our Humphrey-Hawkins  report to  discuss  the fact  that M2  growth deviated from  itshistorical pattern for  a period of  time but  that  it now appears  to  becoming back.  Like Governor Meyer,  I am uncomfortable with  the  currentranges, but  I do not want to  use them as  a monetary policy signal.So,  I agree with your proposal not  to  change  the  ranges  at  this  time,but  I think we  should beef  up our discussion  of  the monetaryaggregates  in the  Humphrey-Hawkins report.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I am  for  leaving  the rangesunchanged.  First of  all,  Dave Lindsey made a good point  in the  sensethat,  although his  chart  on  velocity suggests more stability  over  thepast  2 years  or so,  it  is  still  too  early to  come  to  any firmconclusion.  Secondly, I think changing the ranges systematicallyinvolves  more than explanations.  It  involves raising  questions  inpeople's minds as  to  whether we  have changed  our attitude  about ourlong-term  goal  for  inflation.  Governor Lindsey makes  a point  in  termsof  2 plus  2, but  I think that  requires another discussion.  It  is  2plus 2 for  some, but  it  may be another number  for others,  depending onwhat  they view as  a proper measure of  inflation, and that  would affectwhere  they want to  set  the  ranges.  So,  a lot  more discussion isrequired before we  undertake  to  change  these measures  systematically.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I, too,  am somewhat uncomfortable  with the  wholediscussion,  as  I think everybody is.  I would go  along with yourrecommendation, but  I think we ought  to  think seriously over the  nextfew meetings about  whether ranges  are  in  any sense an  effective policytool  or whether we are  going to  have a continued discussion at eachmeeting about the  symbolism of  something that  really is  not being usedas  a policy tool  anymore.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  inadvertently got ourselves  into  thisbox,  and it  occurred in  a context of  M2  beginning to  veer  off  fromexpected relationships.  At  the moment,  we are  at the  lower  end ofpotential  target ranges  largely because  M2  was  tracking  close to  zerofor  quite  a long period of  time.  We had the  problem  for a protractedperiod of  being perceived as  allowing M2  to  run near the bottom  oreven  significantly under  its  target  range.  As  a result we  did--Idon't want  to use Bob McTeer's  language--move the  target  down over  theyears.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER  (?). We  did draw the  target around the bullet hole!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Clearly, there  is  somethingfundamentally wrong  here.  There  is  no doubt about  that.  But beforewe play with  these ranges,  I would prefer  that we concentrate on7/2-3/96-78-qualitative  discussions with respect  to  M2  and elevate M2  if  in factit begins  to  deserve more emphasis  as  an indicator.  I do  not  thinkthere is  any doubt that we  are  in  an  unsustainable position.  It  makesno  sense.  If M2  ceases to  be  useful at  all,  it would then become  justan  appendage, which would be unfortunate.  But  since it  looks  asthough it  is  coming back, we  are  going to  have  to  confront  this  issue.For the  moment,  there does  seem  to be at  least  a grudgingconsensus  to  stay where we are.  I will  ask Normand to  read  theappropriate  language.  I ask you all  to  listen  to  it  just  in  case,  inview of  our discussion, we want  to  change a few words  here  or  there.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I will be  reading  from page  20  in  the  Bluebook.The  first  sentence is  the  standard  one:  "The Federal Open MarketCommittee  seeks monetary and  financial  conditions that will  fosterprice stability and promote sustainable  growth  in output.  Infurtherance  of  these objectives,  the  Committee reaffirmed at  thismeeting the  ranges  it  had established  in January  for  growth of  M2  andM3  of  1 to  5 percent  and 2 to  6 percent  respectively, measured fromthe fourth  quarter  of  1995  to  the  fourth quarter  of  1996."  Movingdown the  page a bit:  "The monitoring range  for  growth of  totaldomestic  nonfinancial  debt was maintained at  3 to 7 percent  for  theyear.  For  1997,  the  Committee agreed  on  tentative  ranges  for monetarygrowth measured from  the  fourth  quarter of  1996  to  the  fourth quarterof  1997  of  1 to  5 percent  for M2  and 2 to  6 percent  for M3.  TheCommittee  provisionally set  the  associated monitoring range  for  growthof  total  domestic nonfinancial  debt at  3 to  7 percent  for  1997."  Andthe  standard ending  sentence:  "The behavior of  the  monetaryaggregates  will continue to be  evaluated in  the light  of progresstoward price  level  stability, movements  in  their velocities,  anddevelopments  in  the  economy and financial markets."

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Don, when you think  in  terms  of  long-term realinterest rates,  where do you  conceptually put  the  uncertainty premiumabout  inflation?  Is  that  in  the real  component?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes,  it  is  and  that  is because  it  has  always beenthere.  When we think  of  these  things, we do  it  based on history, andthe  uncertainty premium has  been  in the  real  rate historically.  Ithink that would be another reason why the  real  rate might move aroundover time.  If  people are  less uncertain now than  they were  10  or  15years  ago,  and it  is  quite  likely that  they are,  then you might  thinkin  terms  of a lower equilibrium real  rate.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  So,  if  I were  comparing a time when a rise  inreal  rates was  strictly due  to  a change  in real  activity--real  supplyand demand were  the  sole contributors  to an  increase  in real  rates--Iwould distinguish between that  situation and  one where perhaps  some ofthe  increase was  due  to  greater uncertainty about  future  inflation.That makes  the comparison very difficult.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  In  thinking further  about  my answer to yourquestion about where  the uncertainty is  located, I believe we  have  tobe  careful.  There  is uncertainty in  financial  markets that  leads  themto  demand a higher real  rate premium.  But we  also need to  think aboutthe  individuals  and  the businesses  that  spend the money.  My answerassumed  that  they also  were uncertain about  the  outlook for  inflationand that  uncertainty would damp  their spending at  given  interestrates.  If  that uncertainty does  not  affect  them, then  we have  adifferent situation.  The equilibrium real  rate probably would nothave declined in  that  case.  But  I think uncertainty probably doesplay into  spending decisions  as well as  saving decisions,  and so  itmight  be reasonable  to  think  that with  less  uncertainty, the  reallong-term equilibrium rate would be lower.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Don,  I want  to  ask you about your relativeconfidence  level  for variables used in your  forecast.  But  in  view ofyour response  to Tom Melzer just now, I am not sure whether  I shouldrethink  the  question.  In your prepared remarks, you used thePhiladelphia Fed  survey of expected CPI  inflation,  but  the  Bluebooklooked at  the  PCE  to  draw conclusions about  the  real  rate.  Thecritical variables  in  the  staff  forecast  are  the  assumption that  thereal  fed  funds rate  is  2-3/4 percent, some measure  of  inflation  andinflation expectations--the sort  of  thing we  discussed yesterday--andthe NAIRU versus  current unemployment.  With  the nominal  5-1/4  percentfunds rate  and with inflation measured by the  PCE,  one would say  thatwe were at  a 2-3/4  percent real  funds  rate,  that  inflation  is  in  thezone  of  2 percent, and  that unemployment is  whatever number  is  goingto be  reported on  Friday for  the month of June;  it  has  been  in thearea of  5-1/2  percent.  So,  what  is  the problem?  The problem  in  thisframework is  that the  inflation rate has to  go up  from where it  isbecause  current unemployment  is  below the NAIRU.  That  rise  ininflation will reduce  the  real  fed funds  rate  unless we  raise  the7/2-3/96-80-nominal  fed funds  rate.  The  only way we can get  from where we  are  toequilibrium is  through  that mechanism.  The confidence question is:  Ifyou  look at  your key component  variables, where would you say  the weaklinks  or  the  strong links are  located?  Is  your confidence  in  the  5-3/4 percent NAIRU  instead of,  say,  5-1/2  or  5-1/4  percent?  Is  it  inthe  2-3/4  percent  real  fed funds  rate  versus  2-1/2  or 2-1/4 percent?Or is  it  in a particular measure  of  inflation  or  inflationexpectations?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I would have  to  say that  I am not very confidentabout any of  those measures.  There is  a band of uncertainty aroundthem all.  I do  think  that,  as  Mike Prell has  commented--and I thinkGovernor Meyer  said this yesterday as  well--there used  to  be moreconfidence about  the NAIRU  calculation.  In Mike's  chart yesterday, wesaw a lot  of  scatter points  around  the  regression line, but  they werefairly tightly bunched.  However,  the more recent  information raisesquestions  about  the  level of  the NAIRU.  I think our estimates  ofinflation  expectations are  a very weak  link.  We  really do not have afix on  that.  The Philadelphia  Fed survey is  very arbitrary because  itis  a survey of  professional economists  and, as  highly as  we mightthink of  them,  they are not  necessarily representative of  savers  andinvestors  in  society.  The Michigan survey has  its  own problems.  Itseems,  at  least  in  terms  of  the means,  to  be  skewed toward  too  high anumber.  I have  very little  confidence  in our projection of  inflationexpectations or  knowledge of what  they actually are  currently.  I tendto  look at  how they are  changing, not  in terms  of  levels.  If  severalsurveys and other indicators  are  all  moving in  the  same  direction,that might  suggest that  inflation expectations  are moving  the  sameway.On the  PCE versus  the CPI,  I think one  answer  is  that,  if  itis  just  a level  adjustment,  it  is  not  a problem because we arecomparing  the  calculated real  rate relative to history.  We can revisehistorical  and current  values  and the gap remains  the  same.  But  Ithink the  point that  the Chairman made yesterday--and one  that youwill  hear  again shortly--is  that  we might be  getting very differentsignals  from the CPI  and PCE,  not  just  a level  adjustment butdifferent  information  about  what is  going on  in  the  economy.  That  isobviously  a much bigger problem than  just making  a level adjustment.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  What  about your assumption  regarding the  realfed  funds  rate?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Once again,  I think the  assumption about where  theequilibrium fed  funds  rate  is  situated is  very shaky.  When we  look athistory, we  have to  conclude that  things move around, other  things  arenot  equal,  the equilibrium  real  fed funds  rate varies,  and as  I saidin my briefing, that  sort  of  exercise  is  at best  only a starting pointfor  thinking about  the much more complicated issues  relating todevelopments  in financial markets.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  You have made me  feel  a lot more confident![Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Don, I want  to  follow up  on your reference  tofinancial markets  in  terms  of policy actions now or later.  It  strikes7/2-3/96-81-me that  there has been a fair amount  of run-up  and perhaps  even someartificiality  in some  of  the  financial  markets, such  as  those  for IPOsor  indeed whatever market you want  to  talk about.  You  indicated whatthe  effect might be  on  the  stock market  if  we made  a tightening movenow.  But  if  there  is  a certain degree  of  artificiality, what would bethe  effect  of waiting, and what is  the relative risk that we run byletting that market  run up further and then moving versus moving nowand letting the  market adjustment  occur and spill  over to  the  realeconomy?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I guess that depends  a bit  on what you think willhappen if you do  not move.  One hypothesis would be  that,  if  you donot act now, in Mike's words,  gravity will  take  over  and the  marketwill  begin  to correct  itself  even without  the  Federal  Reserve.  Inthat  case, waiting  to  act might  even be a positive in  the  sense  thatby  the  time you did act,  the market  already would be  at morereasonable  levels  and less  likely  to overreact  to our  tighteningaction.  On the  other hand, if  that  correction were not  going tooccur, if  the  froth were  to  remain in  the market,  I think yourquestion contained the  germ of  the  answer.  The more people build  thatfroth  in,  the more  likely you are  to  get a strong reaction.  That  isone  interpretation of  what happened in 1994,  in  the  sense  that we hada low  funds  rate  for  a very  long period of  time  and a very steeplyupward sloped yield curve.  As  economists, we  could say  that a steeplyupward  sloped yield curve means  that markets  expect us  to  tighten;such  an action  should come  as no  big surprise.  The Chairman hadtestified  several times  telling the markets we would be tightening.Yet,  when we embarked on  a tightening course,  which was widelyanticipated, I think a lot  of people who thought  they would be  thefirst  out  the door  actually got  caught.  Everybody ran  for  the door  atthe  same  time,  and  there was  a rather  strong reaction in  financial

If  not,let me hold forth  for a little  longer  than usual because  I think, asGovernor Kelley indicated yesterday, that we are  in  one  of thosewatershed periods that requires  deeper  deliberation on monetary policyissues  than we have had to  face  at  many of  our meetings.The  current period reminds me  of  our struggle several yearsago  to  cope with  the breakdown of  M2  as  a forward-looking  indicator,as  David Lindsey has  amply demonstrated.  You may recall  that  in  theolder regime a slowdown  in M2  growth was an indicator of  increasingpolicy restraint, but  as  the breakdown  of M2  became increasinglyevident we resisted taking action  largely because  the collateralinformation  that was available  failed to  confirm  the usual meaning  ofa sharp rise  in  income velocity.  Current business  indicators point  tosignificant  strength in  economic activity and raise  serious questionsas  to  whether we are running up  against  the  type  of  resourceconstraints  that  in the past have been a harbinger of  a dangerousbreakout  of  inflationary forces.  Yet,  there is  something disturbinglywrong with this  picture:  The  rate of  inflation  still appears  to befalling;  the  growth in compensation per hour is  50  to  75  basis pointsunder the rates  suggested by past relationships;  and the  operatingprofit margins of  domestic  firms have  continued to  expand  far  laterinto the business  expansion than  is  typical.  As  a consequence,  likethe M2  episode only  in reverse,  we have  held in  check our normal7/2-3/96-82-response  to  tighten  in  the  face  of  the  accelerated current businessexpansion.In my judgment, we have done  so wisely because thecredibility of  the  Federal  Reserve System is  at  stake here.  I am notreferring to  the  important but  narrow issue  of  maintaining, and beingseen  to maintain, the purchasing power of  our  currency but  to  theperception  that we  as  an  institution know what  we  are doing.  Are weperceived  to understand  the  changing forces that  are driving oureconomy, or are we viewed as  working with obsolescent models?  We haverecognized  the  crucial need to  be  forward-looking and preemptive withour policies.  But  to be  successful  in  that, we must  understand theeconomic  structure  through which our  policies will play out.  To  gainthe public's acceptance  of  our policies  and our ability to  respond toinflation  threats  in a timely manner,  the public has  to  haveconfidence that  the  Fed knows what  it  is  doing.  Without  prejudgingthe  current  evolution  of  economic  forces, which  I will  get  tomomentarily,  if we  are perceived to have  tightened and then  to  havebeen compelled by market  forces  to  quickly reverse,  our reputation  forprofessionalism will  suffer a severe blow.  This will  weaken ourfuture ability  to  raise rates  in a dramatic, preemptive fashion  inorder  to  contain inflationary forces  at  an early stage.We are an independent  central  bank in  that our  decisions arenot subject  to  reversal by any other  agency of  government.  Ourexistence  and ability to  function, however, are subject  to  acceptanceby a public  and a Congress who exhibit  decidedly  asymmetricpropensities  in favor  of  policy ease.  The reputation  that we haveachieved as  nonpartisan professionals  enables us  to  function.  Thepublic  and the Congress may not understand what we  are doing, but  theytrust  us,  hopefully as  they trust  the  family physician who  isprescribing today's  version of  castor  oil.  I assume that  everyonehere is  old enough to  remember castor  oil!  [Laughter]We  obviously are viewing an economy that  at  the moment  doesnot resemble most of  our  textbook models.  The  unemployment rate  islow and has  remained low for quite  a while.  Anecdotal  evidencecontinues  to  indicate  tight  labor markets, but with little  evidence ofsignificant wage  acceleration.  We  also  have a strong economicexpansion  under way, with industrial commodity prices  falling evenexcluding  the plunge  in  copper prices.  Broader measures  of  priceinflation  are,  if  anything,  still  declining.  There are,  however,  twodisturbing numbers  that  suggest  the  old model may be operative.  Thefirst,  of  course,  is  the very disturbing ECI wage and salary figurefor  the  first quarter.  The second is  the  recent  fairly significantrise  in  delayed deliveries  in the  June NAPM report.  Most  other data,however, are not  supportive  of a rising inflation  trend.  To  be sure,average hourly earnings have been rising at  a fairly pronounced pacein the  last  two  or  three years.  But  as  we discussed yesterday, thatseries  shows  very  little  change when we look at  the  conversion by theBLS  to  a chain-weighted basis.  Indeed, in  the  12  months  ended in May,it  was up 2.9 percent versus  3.4  percent  for the published averagehourly earnings.  The  CPI  is  becoming increasingly obsolete, as  Iexplained yesterday.  The more  analytically accurate core  PCE chain-weighted price  index is  increasing now at a rate  of  about  2 percent,as  is  the  core gross  domestic purchases chain-weighted price index,with  the  increase in  both measures declining  since  1995.  The7/2-3/96-83-hypothesis  that  the  inflation rate has  stabilized  is very difficult  tosustain with this  data system.This  result  is  consistent with  the  insecurity wage  gainhypothesis  that  I have  been discussing here  for  the  last  12  to  18months.  It  is  not proof  that the  structure has  changed, but we willnever have  definitive proof on which to  act  in a timely manner  if  ourpolicy is  forward-looking.  We may in retrospect make veryprofessional and  impressively robust  econometric  estimates of  what hasbeen happening  and conclude that,  indeed, a significant  tradeoff hasoccurred between wage  gains on  the  one hand and job security on theother  in  the  context  that  I have discussed  in  the past.The basic  thesis, as  you may remember,  is  that the  economycan be viewed as  having  a family of  functions  relating to  the realgrowth rate of  earnings,  all  with the  same  slope but with differenttradeoffs between wage gains and job security.  These  data suggestthat we  are moving from one  level  down  to  another.  If  that  is  in  factwhat  is  happening, one would expect to  see  the rate  of  change  inhourly earnings  fall below previous  expectations and profit margins  towiden, though by less  than the gain  from  lower wage  costs because  partof  the  latter  feeds  into  declining price  inflation.  Specifically,this data  set  is  consistent with a lower  track of  real or nominalearnings  growth,  say, until  1993,  but  it  also  is  consistent  with thereemergence  of  the old business  activity-inflation models after atransition period because, remember, we  are then back  to  the  earlier,higher rate of  change  although at  a lower  level.  For those who wouldlike a more  analytic  exposition of this  type of model,  I recommend apaper  that  is  being written by Janet Yellen.  I am certain  that  shewill  make  it  available to  those  of you who  wish to  read it.For  those who  are wedded  to  the  Phillips  curve  format,  thetranslation of  the  50  to  75  basis point  shortfall  in the  growth  ofcompensation per hour is  the  equivalent  of a perfectly trackingPhillips  curve with  a NAIRU of  4-1/4  to  5 percent.  With as  yet  onlylimited evidence  that  domestic  operating profit margins  arecontracting, it  appears that  the  transition postulated in  thishypothesis  is  still  under way.  A falling inflation rate underscoresthis.  But  let us  be careful.  Even  this hypothesis  postulates a one-time move  of  the goal  post.  Inflation  is  not  dead.  As we  again getcloser  to  the new goal  line,  the  old inflation pressures willreemerge.Indeed,  there  is  reason for  concern in  that  regard.  To besure,  second-quarter GDP growth is  the result  of  the  rebound  from anumber  of  retarding factors--the GM strike,  the  government shutdown,and the  inclement weather, with the  latter having  had a very materialeffect especially on state  and local  construction.  However,accelerating economic growth from whatever cause always  has  thepotential  to  generate  accelerating inventory investment.  As  Iindicated at  the  last  FOMC meeting, I am concerned that we may beunderestimating the potential  for an upward adjustment  in  inventoryaccumulation.  If  this  occurs,  then I think we are  subject to  muchstronger than expected third-quarter and possibly fourth-quarterexpansion in  the  context  of  extended lead  times  and perceivedshortfalls  in  safety stocks.  Even  a just-in-time environment  getsoverridden in  that  type  of  situation.  With  the  income  effects thatspill  over  from inventory  investment,  it  is  very easy to  draw a7/2-3/96-84-sequence of  events  that  can create much  stronger GDP growth  than wehave in  the Greenbook.It  is  too  soon to know whether  the  current  surge  in  theexpansion will gradually vanish and fail  to  ignite  inventory growth orwhether the  wealth effect will  support  PCE,  with a lag, on  a highertrack  than is  shown  currently  in  the Greenbook.  Fortunately, we havethe  luxury of  waiting at  least  for a short while  to  see what develops.While  I would not  describe our monetary posture as  tight,  it  isscarcely accommodative.  Real  federal  funds  are  only marginally belowtheir peak  of  last  year.  In  fact,  using the broader deflator,  thatis,  chain-weighted gross  domestic purchases, we have  not reduced thereal  funds  rate at  all.  The  economy may surprise us and accelerate atan unexpected pace, moving  to  the new goal  line  fairly quickly.  ThisAccordingly, I would hope that  this  Committee, whileaccepting  alternative  "B" to  give us  the  opportunity to  assess what  isgoing on, would nonetheless  accept an asymmetric  bias  towardtightening with the understanding  that no move would occur without  aprior telephone conference.  We have to be  aware in  this particularcontext  that  to reverse  direction requires  a somewhat higher hurdle  ofevidence than would be required  if we  were merely continuing aprevious  trend of  monetary policy moves.  Given the recent  history ofsequential policy moves,  any move  in a new direction would suggest  tothe markets  that  there will be  additional moves  in  the  same direction.Although we  could endeavor to  disabuse the markets  of  that, mysuspicion  is  that we would fail.  My judgment is  that  in alllikelihood,  if  the  Committee does  not move  at  this  meeting or  duringthe  intermeeting period, we probably will  do so  at  the August meetingor  later.  It  seems  quite unlikely to me,  looking at  the data now,that  we will  luck out  and find  the  economy expanding at a pace thatwould not  necessitate moving.  But  as  I have  said,  I think we havetime  to  look,  largely because  in my judgment our  current posture isnot  that  far  from the mark.  Vice  Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman, perhaps one  of  thechores  that goes with being Vice Chairman  is  that  after  such a veryinteresting  and demanding presentation, one  fills  the vacuum, givingother people some more  time  to  think.  [Laughter]  Agreeing withGovernor Kelley's  remark yesterday that we  are at  a watershed, I foundmyself  sitting up  straight  at  4:00  this morning thinking about  theresponsibility that places  on us  as  a Committee.  It  is very clearthat  the  Federal Open Market  Committee  cannot  carry out  itsresponsibility without  the  support  of  the American people whom weserve.  We  deserve that  support,  which we  have, and we will  retain  itonly if we  are deemed to  be responsible  and sensible.  That  issomething about  which I perhaps  feel  particularly  strongly because  Iam  the only permanent voting member  of  the Committee who  is  neithernominated by the  President nor  approved by the Senate.  Therefore,  Ithink one  has  to be very aware that we do  serve  the people  and that  weare not members  of  a university faculty  or  a discussion group.Rather, our purpose  is public  policy, which  is  a lot  tougher thanbeing on  a faculty or  a member of  a discussion group.We  are  in  a period of  very considerable uncertainty as  toexactly where the economy is  or where we  are  vis-a-vis pricestability.  My own guess  is  that we are  either at  or very close  to7/2-3/96-85-what  might be  the  upper end of  a price stability range.  In  light  ofGovernor Yellen's presentation yesterday, which explained  that  thereare very real  and continuing costs  to  a reduction of  inflation atthese very low levels,  I believe very strongly  that before we dosomething we  should be  certain  that what  we are doing is  right.Therefore, it  should encourage  us  to  be courageous  when we need  to  becourageous but  to  have  the courage to  do  nothing when  that  is  theright  thing to  do, which  is,  I think, where we  are now.At  the  same  time, we  are  clearly in  a situation  in which  thereal  economy could operate more  strongly than  the  forecast  says  itwill, and therefore  I think it  is  equally  important that  we use  theasymmetric  directive.  For  the new members  of  the Committee,  there  arethree  interpretations  of what  an asymmetric directive means  for  everymember of  the  Committee, but  in  this  case I think  it  is  clear what  itmeans.  It means,  as  the  Chairman stated, that  it  is  not  at  allimpossible  that we will  see  enough incoming data of  a kind  that willlead us  to  the  conclusion that we have  to  tighten before  the  nextmeeting.  In any event,  I think there  is  a reasonable likelihood thatwe  will decide  at  the next meeting that  we have  enough information  towarrant  a tightening move at  that  time.  Therefore,  those who  share myview that price stability is  what we  do  for  a living because  it  is  theroad to  sustained economic  growth have  to  remember that we  are  nottalking about whether  the  infidels  are replacing  the  zealots or  evenwhether we  are a group  of more or  less  tough-minded people.  All  theChairman  is  recommending, which I very firmly endorse,  is  that werecognize  that we do  not  know enough to make  a firm decision at  thispoint, but we  do know  enough so  that our  watching has  to beparticularly attentive.  Therefore,  an asymmetric  directive  towardfirming is  appropriate.

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, I have  not yet  had theopportunity to read Governor Yellen's paper, which I look forward  todoing, But not  having  read it,  I am  reluctant at  this  point todeemphasize what you refer to as  the  "old model."  It  seems  to  me  thatthe  information we heard yesterday suggests  that  the  economy  iscurrently robust, with  the  risks dominating on  the up  side  rather thanthe down side.  I think it  is  instructive, as was pointed  out  thismorning, that  even  if  the  Greenbook baseline projection materializesthrough  1997 with no  change in policy  in 1996  and 1997,  the  Bluebookanalysis  still  says  that  an upward correction of  50  basis points,term.  Moreover,  in the  Bluebook discussion of  short-run  alternatives,the point  is made  that  if we want  to  tilt  inflation down, we may haveto raise  the  federal  funds  rate  "considerably"--I believe that  is  theterm used--or by more  than  1/4  percentage point before  the  end  of  thisyear.With  these considerations  in mind, I think the  case  for  atightening of policy today is  a strong one.  I personally believe  thata solid case can be made  for an  increase of  50  basis points  in  thefederal  funds  rate.  If  we were  to do  that,  I believe  there would be  acredibility benefit  that  could be  substantial.  A decisive move likethis  would tend to  reduce uncertainty  in financial markets andelsewhere about  the ultimate extent of  the  tightening we  might becontemplating.  We could announce  that we expected a midcourse7/2-3/96-86-correction like  this  to bring the  economy back to  a sustainablelonger-term growth path with declining inflation,  and that  might helpto  reduce  the  potential reaction in  financial markets.  I couldsupport  such  a move, but I realize  that  that may not  be an  optiontoday.  In  any event,  I think that  a move  of at  least  1/4  point  isnecessary.  The key thing we  need to  do  now is  to  reaffirm ourdisinflationary credentials  by reversing the  two  moves we made  lastwinter.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, news  on  the  economy since  our  lastmeeting has  strengthened my view that  it would be wise  to  raise  thefederal  funds  rate  at  this  time.  We  cut  the  funds  rate in  Januarybecause  an apparent moderation in  growth was  reducing inflationarypressures  and because we wanted to guard  against  the risk that theexpansion might weaken even  further.  Since  then,  the economy hassurprised us  with its  strength.  Growth  in  the  first half  of  this  yearappears  to  have exceeded the  trend rate by  quite a bit.  Indeed, myconcern now has  shifted to  the  substantial  risk of  rising inflation.In  that situation, whether  one  is  an opportunist  or  of  the  deliberatepersuasion,  strong action is  called  for.  In my view, theseconsiderations support  a 50  basis point  increase  in the  federal  fundsrate.  However, given that  an  increase  would represent a change  in  thedirection  of  policy and would be  a surprise  to  the  market,  it may beprudent  to  limit  ourselves  to  25  basis points  at  this meeting and  anasymmetric directive.Mr. Chairman,  I also  would like  to comment  on yourpresentation, which  I found very interesting.  It  highlighted many ofthe  uncertainties  about  the  analytical  framework  that we  are using  todeal with policy issues.  I also  thought  that  the  emphasis on the  PCEchain-weighted index was quite  instructive.  I would recommend that weput  on  for a day a principled opportunist's  hat  and suggest  to  theBoard staff,  and perhaps also  to our  own staffs  at  the  Banks,  thatthey  look at  what would be  involved to  keep the  PCE chain-weightedindex, maybe  not  at  the  2.1  percent that  it  has  averaged over the  lastyear, but  I would be willing  to  say at  2-1/2  percent.  That would beconsistent  in my view with  containing inflation.  It  might be  veryinteresting  to  see what  the  policy implications  of  that would be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I have not  heard anybody arguing that  the  risksare  not on  the up  side.  I agree with the Greenbook and otherforecasts  that we  are  likely to  see moderation  in growth over thesecond half  of  the  year.  But  even with that,  both  the Greenbook andmost  other forecasts  see  an uptick  in  inflation.  The Greenbook seesthat measured on  a CPI basis  and  the Bluebook sees  that measured on aPCE basis.  Now, it  may be that we  are measuring inflationinaccurately.  It  may be that  the  trend has been down, not  sideways,and  that  there is  room to move up  a bit.  But  if  I took anything outof yesterday's  discussion,  it was  a desire  to hold the  line  at whereinflation has been, however that  is  measured.Our  forecast  in Boston,  like many others,  is  based  onstandard analytical  techniques  that  look at  relationships betweenoverall  capacity and pressures  on inflation  as measured by  the CPI.7/2-3/96-87-Our  forecast  assumes,  as  do  all model  forecasts,  that  the past  is  aguide to  the  future.  I do not  know how these models work with othermeasures  of  inflation, but  I must  say that  I continue  to beuncomfortable with  the assumption  that  things have  changed  in a majorway and that,  while rising inflation  occurred under similarcircumstances  in the  late  1980s,  it  will not happen  now.  I amattracted to  the  analytical  framework  that you set  up in  yourdiscussion about moving  down in  a sense  to  a different  curve and thenstarting  from there.  I find  that  interesting  in  the  context  of  allthe  discussion about job uncertainty, but I am  still  a littleuncomfortable with  it.I know we have not  seen many signs  of  rising  inflation yet,and  one  could argue  that,  as  measured by the  PCE,  there may have beena decline  in  inflation.  However, I do not  think  that we  should waitto  see  it  rise before  acting, given the  backward-looking nature  of  anyinflation statistic.  Moreover,  the  feel  of  the  economy, theavailability of  credit,  the  resilience  of  the housing  and auto marketsso  far,  the possibility that  the  economies  of  some  of  our majortrading partners may be healthier  than we  thought earlier, and theebullience of  the  stock market  even with the modest  downturns of  late,all  suggest  to  me  that  to be  appropriately forward-looking  we  shouldmove now.  That  said,  I do  recognize  the  special circumstancessurrounding an increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate when  it  would be  aturning point.  Inflation  is  not  a major  concern  to  the public.  Infact,  the  concern lies  in  the  opposite direction, as  you have  soclearly pointed out,  Mr. Chairman.We  are  at  a watershed, as  others have said,  and we need to  becareful  as  we were  in  1994  in laying the  proper  groundwork  for themove  that  I think we  all  recognize we probably will  have  to makeduring the  latter part  of  this year.  I hope that we  can startconveying  to  the market and to  the public  in general  that  there arerisks  and we perceive  them to  be on  the  up side.  We  could make thiscommunication  in the  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony and  in that  way laythe  groundwork  for what  I assume will  be  a necessary move at  theyour comments,  I believe we will  have  to  move at  the August meeting.I accept your  recommendation for  today.  I have had misgivings  aboutnot  taking action, as  I have  said in the  past, but  I am okay with itat this  time.  I would like  to  see us  set  the groundwork  for a move  inwhich to me means  that  if  there were  a need to  move before  the  nextmeeting, there would be a phone call  and we would talk about  it.  Mydefinition of  asymmetry at  this point  is  that  it  reflects thedirection  the  Committee sees  the  economy moving.  It  is  not  acommitment by any means, but  it  indicates a direction and it  will  senda signal  when the  directive  is  released to  the public.  So,  I am okaywith your recommendation.  I would vote  for  asymmetry if  I had a vote.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, after  listening  to you, I have abetter  sense  of  the  difficulties  in this  process--the uncertaintyabout  the model  or  analytical  framework  that we use  to assess  theincoming  data.  I also  appreciate Bill McDonough's  comment  that  weneed to  have  the public's confidence  and support.  I think, though,that we  ought to  be  careful before we  abandon the  model we have been7/2-3/96-88-using, as  some members  have said  already.  I would be  reluctant  toabandon  such  a model  given our  past  experience.  Our projectionssuggest  that  there will be  increases  in  inflation, although the  changein our  inflation measures  introduces  a confusing element.  Given theupside risks  that  are associated with the  projections  and weighingthat against  the downside risk of  a small  tightening move,  I thinkthere is  a very good case  for  moving now.  If  I were voting, I wouldput it  in  that  context.  But  I probably would  say that the  asymmetricdirective  toward tightening that  we have  on the  table gives  us  anappropriate  direction  for policy and we can wait  for  increasingevidence  at  least  until August.  I would be willing  to wait  that  long,but  I really  think that  a small move now would have  tremendousbenefits  in  the  long term.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman, yesterday I thought GovernorMeyer laid  out  two  issues  very well.  One  of  them is  how GDP will growrelative  to  trend.  Your  analysis  showed exactly how we  would respond.If we  saw a rise  in  inventory accumulation, to use your  example,  thatsuggested  a sustained, above-trend rate  of economic  growth, we  wouldmove right  away.  That  is  in  fact why you are  recommending anasymmetric  directive.  I do not  think there  is  any disagreement  aboutthat.  The  other issue,  to  simplify  it  in terms  of  the  labor market,is  where  the existing unemployment  rate is  relative to  the  naturalrate,  the NAIRU.  I also have  not  read Governor Yellen's paper, whichprobably has  had about  the best  press  so  far of  any paper  in historyfor  a paper  that may not yet  be  finished.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  It  is  just  a little note.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  You mean it  is  short.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  With both religion and economics, we  tend to  beschismatic.  The  Episcopalians  can't  sing  from  the  Presbyterianhymnbook, and that  is  always  a problem.  But  let me  see  if  I can putwhat has been said before  in an  ecumenical sense.  Jim Stock had avery interesting paper  earlier this  year on  the NAIRU in  the  lastthree decades.  He observed that  it  has been highly variable.  Yes,  ifone  had to pick a number and bet  on  it  for 30  years,  one would picksomething  like  6 percent.  But  it  has  been as  low as  5-1/2  percent  andas  high as  8 percent.  Let me  talk about  the  8 percent number,  forexample.  It  came  during  an  adverse oil  shock.  What  exactly does  theterm NAIRU mean?  It  means  the  level  of  unemployment we  have  to  attainto  stop  inflation  from accelerating.  An oil  shock produces a lot  ofinflationary impetus  in  the  economic system.  To prevent  anacceleration of  inflation, the unemployment  rate has  to  rise  sharplyand put downward pressure  on wages  to overcome  the  oil  shock and holdinflation in place.  The  lesson  is  that  the NAIRU is  variable, butchanges  in  it  due  to  supply shocks  are temporary.  The NAIRU in hisstory came  back down again after the  oil  shock  ended.Mr. Chairman, when  I heard you mention the  numbers  4-1/4  and5 percent  for the  NAIRU, that  set  off alarm bells.  The way Iinterpreted what you just  said is  that  given  the rate  of  disinflationwe recently experienced, the  current  level  of  unemployment,  and theusual  relationship between  the amount  of  disinflation and  thedifference between  the rate  of  unemployment and the NAIRU, you backed7/2-3/96-89-out  an  implied NAIRU.  But  that  is  a temporary NAIRU.  I do  not  thinkwe would gamble policy on  the presumption  that we  have permanentlyreduced the  natural  rate  to  4-1/4  or  5 percent.  A backlog of  fear--this  is  my word for  it--generated by  the  layoffs  and the  downsizingsand whatever else  in  the early  1990s,  created what we  could think ofas  a positive supply  shock, and  the  labor markets  temporarily pushedthe natural  rate  that  low.  It will not  stay that  low, and we  shouldnot bet  that  it will.  What does  that mean  for  short-run policy?  Ithink you have  it  exactly right.  You  told us  how we are  going torespond  to  a demand-side  shock  or surprise,  and I think the naturalrate probably is  much lower right now than  it  has  been historically.But  it  is  there  only temporarily.  The stock of  fear  that pushed thenatural  rate  down will wear  off.  We  do not  know how fast  that willoccur, but we  had better be prepared to  respond when  it  does.  I thinkwe have reached  the  right  solution in  whatever New Age  church[laughter]  it  may be  that you  are describing.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman, while  I recognize  that  I arrived atan interesting moment  for monetary policy, I must  admit  neverthelessthat  I did not agonize  over my position  for  the monetary policydirective  for this  meeting.  Although it may still  turn out  to  be aclose call  as  to whether  or not we  tighten going  forward and as  earlyas August,  I am very comfortable with your recommendation  for nochange in policy at  this meeting  and an  asymmetric policy directive.There are  four good  reasons  for  no  change  in policy at  thistime.  First,  if  you accept  the  staff  forecast and take anopportunistic  approach to  future disinflation,  then  I think  there  areno  strong grounds  for  tightening today.  The staff  forecast  suggeststhat,  with the  current monetary policy settings, we  can sustain anexpansion  at  a trend near capacity with nearly stable  core  inflationthrough  1997.  I fully support  an effort  to  achieve  this  outcome.Second, and I think quite  importantly, my own perspective onthe  outlook  reinforces  this desire  to  the  very minor extent  that myoutlook differs  from  the  staff projections.  While the  staffsimulations provide  a plausible picture of  the  acceleration ofinflation  if  the unemployment rate  is  slightly below  the NAIRU, mynormal high  confidence in  this  gap  story is  undermined by theextraordinarily well-contained state  of  core  inflation  acrossvirtually all  measures.  I for  one would need  to  see  either a declinein  the unemployment  rate below  its recent  range  or an  acceleration incore  inflation measures  to  justify a tightening.My third argument is  a little different,  Mr. Chairman.  Inrecent testimony you presented a compelling discussion of  the  FederalReserve's position vis-a-vis  growth.  I have,  as you might  suspect, aheightened awareness  of  the political  sensitivity  of  this  issue  as  Ispent  several months with  little else  to  think about.  [Laughter]  AsI understand your position,  the  Federal Reserve does  not have a growthobjective per  se.  Once we achieve acceptable resource  utilizationrates  and acceptable  inflation  readings,  at  least  on a near-termbasis,  we will happily accept all  the  growth the  economy will produce.I accept  this  logic.  Tightening  today would contradict  that position.We  should not  tighten  solely on  the basis  of  one  quarter of  above-trend growth when utilization  rates  are not definitively signaling7/2-3/96-90-overheating and when inflation  readings  suggest  inflation  remains  incheck.  This  is perfectly consistent with a transition to pricestability over the  longer  run,  albeit by  the  opportunistic  camp's  timeschedule.Fourth, we will  have a wealth  of  additional  information atthe August meeting.  At  that  time, we will be  in a much betterposition to  assess  the potential  that growth will  remain  above trend.As we  enter  the  second half we will  be better able  to  determinewhether the  strong growth  over  the  first  half has  depressed theunemployment rate below its  recent range and to  judge  the degree  towhich wage pressures may indeed have  intensified and whether  or  notthere is  any pass-through to prices.  I am referring here specificallyto  the  advance report on  second-quarter GDP, where  the mix will  bevery interesting;  the next  two  employment  reports;  a second-quarteremployment  cost report;  and a whole variety of  monthly data  that willcondition our understanding  of  the economy's  momentum heading  into  thesecond half.  My  first  two points make clear that  there  is  littledanger in waiting, and my last  point  indicates  there  is  great benefitfrom doing  so.Now, a word about symmetry versus  asymmetry.  I had a quiteinteresting  time reading  the transcript  of  the last  FOMC meeting, andI am somewhat acquainted with  the various  meanings  of  the words.  Butit  really is  interesting how symmetry means so many different thingsto  different people.  We  are all  asymmetric  in  our policy posture,funds rate.  Nobody envisions  a decline  in  the rate  between  thismeeting  and the next.  Most  of  us  can envision situations where  wewould have  to  raise  the  rate.  All of  us  recognize  that  it  will  be atough call  at  the next meeting, so  I would have  thought  that  the  tiltin  the directive  for  this  meeting would be an  easy  call.  Personally,I am asymmetric  and would feel more  comfortable with an  asymmetricdirective.  From my reading  of  the  last  transcript,  it  does  appearthat  some  members  of  this  Committee  read  into the  distinction betweensymmetry and asymmetry  differing degrees  of  permissiveness withrespect  to  a move between meetings  initiated by the Chairman.  Thisyou would consult with the members  of  this Committee  in  theintermeeting period before  initiating a reversal of  the direction ofmonetary policy.  With that  caveat,  I fully support  an asymmetricdirective.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Based on theincreased upside risks,  I think that  a tightening of policy is  goingto be needed  in the next  several months,  but I am a bit moreoptimistic than  the  Greenbook on  inflation.  I am not  convinced that  alarge increase--or a series of  increases--in  the  federal  funds  rate  isnecessary.  In  that vein, a tightening move  could be  delayed.  I amgenerally ambivalent on  asymmetric  directives, but based on the upsidepotential  for  the  economy and the  attendant  inflation  risks,  it doesseem to me  that  the  case  for  tightening has  strengthened.  Asymmetrywould allow for  an intermeeting move.  It  seems  to me  that measures  ofprice inflation  and the  ECI  are particularly  important  information.In  that  regard, I would still  urge  a phone  call.7/2-3/96-91-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  The  future usually bears  some  resemblance  to  thepast, but  the  future  is  almost  always  different  from  the past.  Ithink we are  in  one  of  those  situations now where we  do not  know howmuch different  the  future will  be.  I believe most of  us  feel  as  wetalk to people  in  our Districts  that  it  may be more  different, atleast  for  a while,  than we have become  accustomed to.  That higherdegree of uncertainty ought  to  make us  more cautious  about takingsteps  at  this meeting, and I feel  very comfortable  about  keepingpolicy the  same.Looking ahead, clearly  the  case  for  tightening and theprobability that  we will  have  to  tighten in  the  coming months would befairly high under  the  old model.  That may  indeed turn out to  be  thecase.  On the  other hand, it may not  turn out  to  be  the case  becausewe  may be able  to  remain on  an unchanged policy course  longer than wenow anticipate under  these  conditions without  accelerating  inflation.So,  while I am prepared to  support an  asymmetric  directive, it  doesnot  automatically mean in my mind that we are  setting  ourselves  up  fora tightening.  That may indeed be necessary, and  I think we  need to  bewatchful.  Should conditions  arise where we have  to  tighten, I thinkwe  ought to  do  so  and we  ought  to  be  decisive  about  it.  But  I do  notknow when  that  tightening will need to  occur, whether  it will  be nextmonth, the  month after,  or  six months  down the  line.  For  today, Iagree  that we  should make  no  change in policy, be very watchful,  andkeep  an  open mind as  to  what  we  ought  to do  at  the  next  and subsequentmeetings.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I am very comfortable with your  recommendation,Mr.  Chairman.  It  is  extremely hard  for us  to  explain the  current  setof  facts  to  ourselves  with  the models  that  all  of us  have been using,implicitly or explicitly.  I am intrigued by your  construct, but veryfrankly none of  us  really knows what  is  happening.  It  seems  to methat  moving now to  tighten policy would  demonstrate  that  the  FederalReserve has a knee-jerk reaction  to  growth even when we  have not  seenany clear evidence of  increases  in  compensation,  let  alone  in prices.I  think it  would be  a  mistake  if  we were  to  tighten because  theeconomy is  stronger.  It  is unclear  to me what  an  asymmetric directiveconveys.  I asked several people,  including you,  and I got verydifferent  and confusing answers and now  I do  not want  to  know exactly![Laughter]  My personal guess  is  that we will be  in  the  same quandaryin August.  We will  have more  information, but  we will  still  be unsureabout  exactly what  is  happening.  But  I see no reason not  to  admit  toourselves  that  we could have  a shock  that would occur  in  theintermeeting period that would cause you to  do  what  I assume you woulddo anyway, namely get  on  the phone and say, what do  we do  now?  So,  Iwould go along happily with your recommendation.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think you focused thediscussion appropriately  on  the underlying inflationary process  and onthe  questions of  what we  know or do not  know about  it.  I certainlywould admit  that  I do  not know as  much  about it  as  I would like.  Theworld may indeed have  changed, but even  so,  if  I understood you7/2-3/96-92-correctly, the  change  involves  a transition having  to  do with concernsabout job security and so  on.  Some other things  that  strike me  aboutthe  economic  environment  at  the moment  are  that  financial  conditionsseem  to  be what  I would describe as  generally permissive.  Credit  isreadily available  on attractive terms.  Wealth  effects  stemming  fromthe run-up  in  stock prices  ought  to be  sizable.  I guess  we have beencautious  in  terms  of  how we have built  that  into  our model  as havesome  other models  as  well.  It  seems  to me  that bond marketparticipants  clearly are not  convinced at  this point  that  inflation  isdead or  even dying.  I think there  is  still  a significant  inflationpremium in  long-term interest  rates.  Having said all  that  and havinglooked at  the available  information, my judgment  is  that  the economyand its momentum are  likely  to be relatively strong.  My preferencewould be  to raise  the  funds  rate  1/4  percentage point now.  I viewthat  in part  as  taking out  a little  insurance  that the  old model willreassert  itself more quickly  than we  expect.  Certainly, a 1/4 pointmove  is not  going to  trigger  any tailspin in  economic  activity.  Italso  seems  to me  that under  all  the  circumstances  at  the moment,  sucha move could be  at  least  a start  of  a policy to  bend inflation down abit  further,  and  it  may be just  the  right thing  to do.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  First  of  all,  I think the prospect of  risinginflation  is  the  biggest  risk we  are  facing  in  the economy  in  thecoming months.  There  is  no question  in my mind about  that.  I alsothink policy is  in an  accommodative  stance  from a number of  differentperspectives.  So,  I conclude  that we  ought  to  move now, and I wouldbe  inclined when we  do move  to  do  so  aggressively.  By  that I meanthat  I would raise  the  federal  funds  rate by 50  basis points,  and Iwould combine  that with a 50 basis point  increase  in the  discountrate.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  I indicated in  theearlier go-around,  I, like most  others,  expect  the economy to  slow  inthe  coming quarters,  leaving us  with a rate of  growth withoutincreasing price pressures  that perhaps  can be achieved with ourcurrent policy stance.  I would like  to give  things  a chance  to playout  a bit more.  Certainly, this position requires that  one be  of  theview that  our current  policy position is  not  accommodative.Unfortunately, like many of  the  other issues  we have  faced and talkedabout  in  the  last  two days,  we  cannot  demonstrate that  categorically.Based on my review of  information  from financial  markets  as well  ascompeting forecasts,  I am not convinced that  current policy is  addingfuel  to  the  current  inflation environment.  As  Don reminded us  thismorning, it  is  equally clear that we  probably are not  reducing generalprice pressures at  the moment  except  to  the extent  that  a continuedexperience of  slow, relatively stable  inflation works  to  temperconcerns  about  our  commitment to a low inflation  environment.  I wouldprefer to  see us  keep policy unchanged for  the moment.  I, too, wouldbe  comfortable with an asymmetrical directive  as  long  as  it  is not  anirreversible leaning, making us  feel  compelled to move at  the nextmeeting even if  conditions do not  seem to  support  that move.  Thankyou.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  it  is  very correct  to  besuspicious  of  the notion that  this  time  things have  changed.  That isa classic  trap.  It  is  frequently a loser's  cry, and  I find myselfvery uncomfortable  supporting  that notion.  By conventional  standardsI think the  case to  move now is  somewhere between  strong andcompelling.  But  I also  think that  there  are very strong  indicationsthat  things  have indeed changed.  Maybe  the better  question--it is  atleast  for me--is whether this  change is  temporary and whether  it  willturn  around very soon.  If  it  does  go back toward a more conventionalexperience, will  it  look the  same  as  it  did historically?  I wouldcompare  this  to  the recent history  of M2  that we  discussed earlierthis  morning.  M2  tracked along very well, very conventionally forsome number of years, went badly  off  the  track for  a while  for  reasonsthat were hard to understand at  the  time,  and now seems  to  be comingback again.  The nature  of  the  M2  episode  is  beginning to be betterunderstood.  That may be in  the process  of happening here  as  well.But  the  presumption either that  things have not  changed or,  if  theyhave,  they will immediately return  to  the  traditional  relationship,carries  its  own dangers and  its  own uncertainties.  The better part ofvalor  is  to  try to  get  as  good a reading  as  we  can get  as  thingsprogress before we  commit one  way or  the  other.  As  a consequence,  Istrongly support your notion  of  a "B" directive  and can  supportasymmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mr. Chairman,  I can  support  your recommendation.I could also  have  supported a recommendation for  tightening  today, hadyou made  it.  On principle,  I prefer  not  to  tighten monetary policy onthe basis  of  strong output and employment  growth  or  even a lowunemployment rate.  I know that we should not wait to  see  the  "whitesof  inflation's eyes"  before acting, but  I do  think we might  well waitfor  some leading indicators  of  rising inflation before we  act.  Thatthey are strangely missing does  suggest  to  me  that  something  isdifferent  in  1996.  With respect  to  symmetry,  I believe  the  Baptistreligion prefers  symmetry, but  I do backslide occasionally  [laughter]and am happy  to do  so  today.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Baptists have a point of  view on  this?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Try to  top  that,  Governor Yellen!

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I can't, Mr. Chairman!  I agree with youranalysis and many of  you have been eloquent  in  expressing thoughtsthat  I agree  with:  the Vice Chairman,  Governor Meyer, Governor Rivlin,President McTeer, and others  among you.  I can certainly support  therecommendation to  leave  the  funds  rate where  it  is  with an asymmetricdirective.  I agree  that  the risks  are unbalanced  at  this  stage, and  Icertainly can envision a set  of  data between now and our next meetingthat would justify in my mind a move  following  a phone call.  But  Iagree with you that  there  is  a great benefit  to  waiting and watching awhile  longer  to decide how things  are  going.  I consider this  a periodof  great uncertainty.  To my mind, the most  serious  risk at  this  stageis  that  we  simply do not  know how demand is  likely  to behave goingforward.  I think that  if  we have significantly underestimated thecontinuing robustness of  aggregate demand so  that  we  see  a significantreduction in  labor market  slack  in coming months  or,  alternatively, ifour  assumption that  something has  changed  in  labor markets  is  clearly7/2-3/96-94-proving to  be  incorrect, we will be  compelled to move and I willcertainly support  those  moves.  I found the Bluebook policysimulations  and also  the  Taylor Rule  computations useful.  To my mind,they mean that we  are  roughly correctly positioned at  this point;  weare  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  equilibrium real  funds rate.  So,  I donot  feel  that our policy stance  is  way off  from where  it  should be,and I think we  can wait  and see  how these  things materialize.  I don'tthink we need to  jump  the  gun in  order to  establish our  credibility toprove  to markets  that we  are prepared to  act.  All  we need to  do  isactually to  act when we  see  that  the  circumstances  justify it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I think  the  risks  are  clearly onthe up side,  as we  all  have  said.  The issue  is  whether  the rate  ofeconomic growth will  slow in  the second half  of  this year.  I thinkthat  it  will  based on the  evidence we have  seen.  The business  peoplewith whom I have  been  in  contact  also sense  that  the economy  isslowing.  The  question is  whether  it  is  going to  slow enough to  havethe  effect  that we will  need.  Obviously, the people with whom I comeinto  contact  are not  a random sample.  You mentioned the issue  ofinventory  accumulation, which  I think is  very important as  we  lookthrough  the rest  of  the year.  The  Greenbook assumes  that  appreciableinventory  rebuilding will  occur over  the  second and third quarters  andthat  subsequent  inventory accumulation will  be relatively modest.  Ofcourse,  that  was not  the pattern that we  saw last  year when sizableaccumulation continued  for a number  of quarters.  If  such accumulationdoes  spill  over  into  the  fourth quarter, we will  not  see the  second-half  deceleration in  economic growth  that will  be  necessary.  So,  Isupport  the  asymmetrical  directive.  I think  it  is  crucial  that wewatch carefully.  I also  support having a phone  call  before making anythat you are  going  to  be  giving is  very important  at  this  particularstage of  the  expansion  and policy  formulation.  It would be  anexcellent opportunity  to  alert  the  Congress and the American people  toour concerns  regarding  the risks  in  the  economy at  this  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I think the  reasons  for  a change  in  thedirection  of  policy have  to be even more convincing  than for  a changein  the  same direction  as  prior moves.  Our action  in  early 1994,  whichsubsequently was  viewed as having  been correct by people  on  theoutside, was  very important  in  that  regard.  If  I were  as  convinced assome  of  the people around  the  table  that  the  current stance  of  policyis  too  expansionary, I would not  only support  a 1/4  point  change, Iwould say, let's  move at  least  1/2 point  to  get  to where we need  tobe.  If  I were  as  convinced as  my own staff  that  the  reduction  inconvinced of  either of  those things,  and  I am not at  all  convincedthat  an action  in August  will  be warranted.  If  the  staff  forecast  isanywhere in  the right ballpark, we will  see in  the  second half  of  thisyear  a lower  rate  of  change  in most  of  the price measures and a lowerrate  of  growth in most  measures of  real  economic activity:  housing,autos,  real GDP,  and job  growth.  An action  now at  the  beginning of  aperiod when everything will start  to  show a significantly deceleratingexpansion would subsequently  look  like we came  from  a differentplanet.7/2-3/96-95-The  asymmetry issue  is  troubling to me because,  as  someothers have mentioned, I have a problem in principle  as  to  what  itmeans  and the message  it  sends.  I would not want  support  of  asymmetryto mean a predisposition  to  tighten policy in August.  But  I amconcerned about how going asymmetric now and going back to  symmetricin August would be  interpreted.  It  is  almost as  if,  once we  adopt anasymmetric  directive, we  are  forced  to  go ahead  and take  the  action sothat  we can go  back to  symmetric  again.  That  is  troubling.  But  Iwould not  dissent  if you want  to go  asymmetric.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I should  say that  there have beenoccasions  in  the past when we have gone  asymmetric and withdrawn it.But  the point  you make  is well  taken.  I think the broad mode  of  theCommittee  is  Alternative B,  asymmetric.  I will ask  the  Secretary toread the  appropriate  language  for that motion.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we  can break for  coffee.  Thenwe will  come back  to a  discussion  of  swaps and intervention.[Coffee break]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You will  recall  that we twice postponedthis  discussion until  we  could be  joined by  our two new colleagues.7/2-3/96-96-That is  one more reason I am delighted that  they  finally came  onBoard.The  staff paper prepared by Messrs.  Fisher, Kohn, and Trumanraises  a number  of  interrelated issues.  Our objective  today shouldnot be  to try to  reach  firm conclusions  on  any of  those  issues,  butrather  to have an open, preliminary discussion with a view to havingone  or more  subsequent discussions  aimed at reaching a consensus  onthe  wisdom of  some of  these matters.  The excellent paper  that  hasbeen presented to us  focuses  on  a relatively narrow, nonethelesscomplex, set of  issues associated with  the  future  of  the  swap networkand a possible alternative mechanism to  deal with the  short-termdollar liquidity needs of  foreign central banks.  However, in readingover the  staff  paper, I was  struck by the  fact  that  it  does  notaddress  directly the  deeper principles  that  should govern us  in  ourdealings with other  central banks.  We have discussed our  foreignexchange  transactions at  great  length  in  recent years,  and we haveendeavored to  define a set  of  operational principles  to bridge oursomewhat  ambiguous relationship with Treasury as  well as withinstitutions  such as  the  G-7.I am not  suggesting we  go  back and review  these particularissues  at  this  point, but we have not  recently reviewed our  long-standing procedures on RPs  and our reluctance  to  engage  in reverse  RPswith other central banks.  I gather the  latter results  from the  factthat when the Committee  last  focused  on these  issues,  the nature ofcentral bank bilateral  relationships was  far  less  complex, as  indeedwas  the  international  financial  marketplace.Last  year, we initiated an  arrangement with the  Bank of  Japanto set  up a procedure to  liquefy Japanese holdings of  U.S.  Treasuries.We also  have recently entered a broadened swap  facility with Mexicoand Canada.  But what  is  our  generic policy in  such  arrangements?  Wehave  chosen  to  accept  foreign exchange risks with  our larger-than-historic holdings of  foreign currencies,  yet we will  not  accept marketrisk on  central bank credit transactions.  Is  this  a general  principlewe wish  to promulgate?  Do we wish, however,  to lend even withoutrisk,  for  example, through reverse  RPs,  to  any central  bank thatrequests  such an  accommodation?  Are  there foreign policy concerns  inthis regard that  should attract our  interest?  Does  the  RP pool of  theFederal  Reserve  Bank of New York as  currently operated reflect  suchprinciples?Finally, does  the broader set  of  issues  surrounding our  rolein  a changing international  and political environment,  in which newfinancial  centers are  emerging and cross-border financial  linkageshave intensified, require our  focus  before we  decide on how best  todeal with  future requests  to  meet  the  liquidity needs  of  our  sistercentral banks?  These developments have  the potential  to  change boththe  character and the origin  of  systemic risks  compared with what weexperienced in  the past.  They may have  implications as  well  for theway we perform our  responsibility as  the central bank for  the U.S.dollar.In your  comments on  the  issues  raised in  the  staff paper, youmight touch on  these broader  issues as  well.  My sense  is  that  itwould be useful  to  try to  achieve a consensus  on  the conceptualframework  for  our  international operations before  we try to  reach7/2-3/96-97-final  decisions  on  the  specific  issues raised in  the  staff  paper.However,  in an effort  to  limit  the  scope of  our  discussion somewhat,  Iwould request  that we remember  that  our purpose  today  is  to have  afree-ranging, but preliminary, discussion.  What  I hope  the Committeewill  offer is  some guidance about  how we can move  forward on some  ofthese  issues on  the  basis  of  an updated conceptual  framework withwhich we all  are reasonably comfortable.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I do  not have  anyprepared remarks, but  let  me make just  a few comments  if  I may.  Theapproach that  the Federal  Reserve has  to  foreign central banks  is verymuch a product  of  the  rather unusual  structure of  the Federal  Reserve,with  the Board of  Governors  and the  12  Reserve  Banks.  The FederalReserve Bank of New York historically has played a particularlyimportant  role  because we  are  in  the nation's  financial  center  andbecause we  do  the  intervening in both the domestic  and the  foreignexchange markets.  The attitude  that  foreign central banks  have  towardthe  Federal  Reserve  is,  thank heavens,  one  of  great  respect.  Theytake  us  immensely seriously, including not  only central bankers  fromsmall  countries  that you might  think would take us  seriously becauseof  our being a superpower, but also  those  from the other  G-10  centralbanks as well.  I think one of  our strengths  is  that we respond topeople  in  a flexible and unbureaucratic way.  For example,  some  of  theG-10  central bank officials  deal very actively with staff  at  the NewYork Bank and the Board and certainly with you personally, Mr.Chairman,  and we never get  into a mode  of  telling  them that  theyreally ought  to  be talking with Joe  instead of  me.  This  approachworks very well because we are  rather good at keeping everybody elseinformed.  The  other Reserve Banks, depending on  the part  of  the worldinvolved and to  a degree  the personality of  the  staff  or  the  Presidentat  any given  time, play very important  roles  as  well.  So,  I thinkthat  this  customer-oriented view of  dealing with  foreign central  bankshas  great merit and  should be continued.  We  should not  try to  force amethod of  dealing with the  Federal Reserve  System on people, but weshould just  let  them deal with us  as  they have  in the  past  in thecontext  of  continued very amicable relationships  among the  variousparts  of  the Federal  Reserve System and especially among  the  key staffmembers  involved as  well  as  the  Board members  and Bank presidents.We also,  I think, have to  be very aware of how  the world ischanging.  Historically, our very important relationships  have beenwith the  G-10  central banks, basically Europe, Canada,  and Japan.  Inaddition, we  have developed very important  relationships with thecentral banks  of our hemisphere, an  area  in which I particularly  getinvolved because of  the  historical accident  of  speaking Spanish veryfluently.  The new area where central  bankers are very much interestedin us  is  Asia.  People from that  part of  the world have very activerelationships with  the  San Francisco Reserve  Bank, especially in  thebank supervision area,  very active relationships  with Board staff,  andvery active  relationships with us  in New York.One  of  the  areas  that  I hope  we will  concentrate  on andeventually resolve,  but not  today, relates to  developments  in  the  repoand  really the  last  time  it  was looked at  in great depth was  in  the1970s,  the government  securities market was very different.  TheCommittee  did not envision  in  the  1970s  that we  had to  do  anything forthe  central banks  around the world in the  way of  providing liquidity7/2-3/96-98-other than  allowing them to  take part  in the repo  pool  at  the New YorkBank.  For  example,  at  the present  time  we are  somewhat inconveniencedby having $3 billion of while  they hold $3 billion ofour  collateral.  The  funds  are  sitting  in New York as  a pool  in casewants  to  use  them  to  meet the  liquidity needs ofin our  time zone.We  cannot deal  with them in  reverse repos,  whichholdings  of U.S.  governmentwould allow us  to  take  their securities and give  them money  for  a day or  two,  because nobodythought such  a financing arrangement was  necessary 20  years  ago.  So,the Desk does  not have  the  authority to  make reverse repos  [withanother central bank].  Leaving aside  for  the moment  whether it  isimportant in  our dealings with  foreign  central banks  to  have  thatcapability, I think it  is  very  important  from  the  standpoint of  ourmanagement  of bank reserves  and to meet our  responsibilities to  theU.S.  securities market.  That's because we are  in  the awkward positionthat,  if  at  a given point  in time  we wanted to  provide  liquidity--notto  accommodate their  interests but  to  serve our own--and we wanted todo  so  on a temporary basis instead  of  purchasing the  securitiesoutright  to  meet a liquidity need that  might  last  for a couple ofdays, we  would not have  the authority  to do  that.  I do  not  think thatis  in  our  interest  in as  complex  a government securities market  asexists  now.  It  is  essentially  an anachronism.When we  look at  the  foreign  central bank aspect  to  it,  thedebate on  how many angels  can fit  on  the head of  a pin is  kids'  stuffcompared with the debate  among  lawyers,  accountants, and economists onwhether  a reverse repo  is  a securities  transaction  or  an extension  ofcredit.  Since  good and decent people can argue  it  is  an extension  ofcredit,  I think we would have to be very careful  in how we use  thatcapability.  My own view would be that  at  some point, when we  actuallymake a recommendation,  it  should include  the condition  that  it wouldbe done  only with  the previous approval  of  the  Chairman.  If  theChairman were not available,  then  it  would be done with the previousapproval  of  the  Vice Chairman, wearing my hat  as Vice Chairman of  thisCommittee but  looking at  the  convenience that  I happen  to be  in NewYork where  the Desk is.  That,  I think, would give us  adequateprotection against  the  Desk ever  thinking that  this was a tool  thatthey would use in  the  normal course  of  business.  Having run  the Deskmyself,  I know that  a Manager  takes  very seriously ringing up  theChairman even via the  ever  loyal  Don Kohn and saying, by the  way, Iwould like to  do  something  that  I am  supposed to  do  very infrequently,but  now is  the  time.  A Manager  thinks  that  through a few  times beforemaking that  phone call,  and I believe  that would be appropriate.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Just  a couple  of  questions relevant tothis  issue:  The real  danger here,  as  you imply, is  that  there  arenumerous people who can envisage  a reverse repo  as  an extension ofcredit.  I can very readily see  that  there are  certain  countries withwhich the  Federal Reserve  Bank of New York might engage  in a reverserepo and  that  transaction would not sit well with variousCongressional  committees or  a variety of  other groupings within  thissociety.  Do  you think we  should have at  least  some  indication  fromthe Committee  as  to  the  eligible  list  of  countries  or  some mechanismfor  making that  sort  of  judgment  other  than requiring it  to  be made bythe Chairman  or  the  Vice Chairman of  this Committee?7/2-3/96-99-

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I think that hasgreat merit.  The question is  the  form.  Would you want  a list orwould you want a sense  of  the  Committee concerning what  sorts  ofcountries might  be on  the  list?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  do not want  a published  list.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Yes,  and we  do  not  want a leakedlist  or  somebody trying to  obtain  it  through a FOIA request.  A  listcannot be  leaked or released if  it  does  not exist.  My preferencewould be  for us  to  have a discussion to  arrive  at  a sense  of  theCommittee  concerning standards.  The  latter might  include  therequirements  that  a country should be highly creditworthy and not  bein  conflict with the United States  of  America in  some manner.  I thinkthe  Committee  could give  certain guidelines  for  the Desk  and theChairman to  follow.  This  is  not a firm  opinion, but  my own workinghypothesis is  that we  would be better off  to  have guidelines  ratherthan  a list.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Perhaps  they might  include  such  a thingas  the  State Department's  acquiescence in American citizens  visitingsuch  countries.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Yes,  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, I would like  to  take  advantage  ofyour offer  to  discuss  the  broader principles bearing  on  this  issue  andto  leave  some of  the  details  for a subsequent discussion.  I think thefundamental  question that underlies  the  several discussions  of  swapsin which  I have  participated  is  whether we believe  that central  banksshould have reserves  in foreign  currencies  that  they use  either  tosupport foreign exchange  markets  or  to  address payments systemproblems or both.  My  answer to  that  is  that  I am in  favor  ofmaintaining balances  in  foreign  currencies.  I say  that despite  thefact  that  foreign exchange  intervention is  tricky and more  importantlyit  is not  suited in  some ways  to what  one might regard as  a purepast  and not having  them seems  to  me  to be  more risky than maintainingthem despite all  the  questions  that  they raise about  the  size  ofholdings,  earnings,  and related matters.We have  accumulated a lot  of  foreign exchange holdings,though  I gather mostly in  two  currencies,  over  the years.  Swap  lines,as  I understand them, were put  in place  to provide  currency balanceswhere none  existed.  So,  having foreign  exchange balances  and  swaplines  at  the  same  time is  a lot  like  having a belt  and suspenders,too.  Should we  do  away with  swaps?  Over  the years,  I have  come  to  bea believer in the  desirability of belts  and  suspenders at  the  sametime.  I think the  combination  is  often  a good thing,  especially whenthe  suspenders  are  quite cheap and are legal  as  in  this  case.  I alsobelieve that  engaging  in  foreign exchange  intervention and using swapsin conjunction with the Treasury, rather than  compromising ourindependence,  is highly useful,in providing us  with an opportunity  toinform and moderate Treasury actions.  Treasury practices  in  this areacan, of  course, bounce back and forth depending  on the policies of  the7/2-3/96-100-Administration.  It  is possible  that existing balances of  foreigncurrencies may not be  sufficient  in  some  cases like  the Mexicancrisis.  Swaps  are  the  time-honored way of  getting  foreign  currencies,and the  fact  that  our  swap  lines  have not been used in recent yearsexcept by Mexico  seems  fortuitous  to me but  not especially relevant  tothe  issue of  whether  or not  they should exist.The use  of  repo  facilities  is,  I think, a separable  issue.Repo  facilities  inherently involve  maintaining foreign  exchangebalances,  as  I understand them.  At  least based on  the materialpresented in  the  staff memo,  I find  it  difficult  to  come  to  a settledconclusion on  the  expansion of  repo  facilities because  I think we needa fuller  treatment and fuller  discussion at  some point  as  to  exactlyhow they are  used and  in what  situations  they are used.  But based onwhat  I know about  them, I find  it  hard to  imagine  that  repo facilitiescould replace  swaps.  They do not  seem to  deal with the  issue  of  alack  of balances  in  the  affected currency.  What happens, for  example,when there  is  a sterling run on Citibank branches  in London?  We  donot  have a lot  of  sterling balances.  If  this  repo process  is  used toreplace  swaps, which  is  the  implication  of  the memo, how does  thathelp us  deal with  that?  Whether repo agreements  are  standard orcustomized, they could involve  a major negotiation process with  everycountry  involved, and this  undoubtedly would  take a lot  of  time  andeffort.In  short,  at  least  in my own mind--and I could be naive orwrong about  this--it  seems  to be a little  like mixing apples andoranges  to  imply  that  swaps  could be  replaced by repo  arrangements.It  may be  that  I do  not understand this  well,  but  there does  seem tobe a bit of  a mix here.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  a mix.  It  is  not  a replacementfor  the  actual  mechanism.  It  is a political  replacement,  if  I may putit  that  way.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes,  it  certainly seems  that way.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  It  is  not belts  and suspenders.  One  is  a beltand the other  is  a raincoat.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I did not use  "belt and suspenders" with regardto  the  repo  facilities.  It  was with regard  to  swaps  and theaccumulation of  foreign exchange balances.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Just remember a raincoat  is  anti-liquidity.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Because we have  a December deadline onapproving  the  swap network  for yet  another year, my preference  at  thispoint would be  to  approve  the swap  network.  I think it  would be  veryuseful  for us  to engage  in a more thorough review of  alternatives.  Icertainly would like  to  see  fewer  questions and more strawmen put upas possible ways  that we  could deal with  the  issue.  I would like  tohave some  idea  of  how people  see using a broader range  of  repofacilities.  If we were  to  engage  in negotiations with ourcounterparties,  I think it would be  rather arduous  to  get  the  changewe want.  If  and when we want  that  to  occur, the paper asks  thequestion whether  that  should be  linked  in some way or  another  to  the7/2-3/96-101-European Monetary Union.  I am agnostic  enough about  that  and what  itwould mean over  the near  term that  I think we  should go  ahead withthis reevaluation.  We  should look at  various  scenarios,  but we shoulddo  it  on  our own  timetable and not the  European timetable.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I appreciate  the  breadth of  thisdiscussion and for my purposes would like  to  put it  in  a differentperspective.  In my view, the  first  issue  relating to  our  swap  linesis  our attitude  toward intervention.  That has been  the reason  fortheir existence, why  they have  been maintained and renewed.  My ownpreference is  for us  to intervene  on  a very  limited basis,  and I thinkthat also  has been a very strong premise  for some  time  for many onthis Committee.  I believe that  should continue.  We have  foreigncurrency balances  that provide us  with a mechanism for  interventionshould we  choose to  use  those  balances  in  circumstances that we deemappropriate.  As  they have evolved over  the  years,  our swap  lines  havebeen of  very limited use, and I think they present  a confusing pictureabout  our role  and intentions going  forward.  We  should phase  themout.  As  far  as  the  timing is  concerned, the  European Monetary Unionprovides us with an  opportunity.  We may not be  in  a position tochoose  the  exact  timing, but  it  is  an  opportunity to phase  out  theswap  network in  a rational  way without  raising a lot  of questions  oruncertainties.  I think we  should take advantage  of  that  opportunity.That  brings me  to  the  issue of  liquidity, whether we call  itreverse  repos  or  lending to  others.  I am very uncertain about  thatand would not want  to  indicate my leanings  at  this time  because Ithink we need more  information  and a broader  discussion.  I know onthe  basis of  some of  the  documents  that  I have seen  in  the past  thatthere has been a very strong reluctance  to  get involved in theappearance or  the  reality of  lending to  another central  bank or  otherinternational  financial  institution.  So,  I would like  to  know alittle more about  the  potential  liquidity needs, what  countries wouldbe  involved, and how we would set  general  criteria  for providing  fundsif  we are  going  to  move down that  road.  I certainly would hesitate  todo  it  very quickly.  Perhaps it  is my own  ignorance,  but  I believe weneed more  information on  the  table before we move  to  a decision.  AndI  think that  is  a  separate  issue  from swaps  in principle.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is.  Let us  emphasize  that  it  is  anissue that  can be discussed on  its  own merits.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I think we  should do  that  over  time  in  futuremeetings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I thought  there was a generalagreement  in our  earlier discussions  that  if  we did not already haveswap  arrangements, we would not  invent  them, so  the  question lookingforward was  simply one of  tactics  for getting rid of  them.  Cathy inher  remarks  raised some  question as  to  whether we  should invent  themif  we did not  already have  them.  Another  issue  is  who is  on the  list.Should we have a swap  agreement with Denmark,  for  example, and underwhat  circumstances would we use  it  or allow them  to  use  it?7/2-3/96-102-In one  of  our discussions  last  year, Mr. Chairman, you madereference  to  the  renewals  of  these  swap  lines  as  being like  Christmascards.  I went  home  after that meeting  and cut  all  foreign centralbankers  off my Christmas  card  list!  [Laughter]  A problem with a swaparrangement,  either  a current  arrangement  or  any new one,  is  that  itis  expected to be used and the  question is under what circumstancesand with what unintended consequences.I think none  of  us was happywith  the  further  temporary increase in  our swap  line with Mexico  andrelated decisions  a year and a half ago.  It  was messy;  it wasuncomfortable with the U.S.  Treasury;  it was uncomfortable  with theIMF.  It  was  difficult  and uncomfortable with  the Mexicans.  We wouldhave been better  off  if  we had not had the  swap  line.  I would hopethat  by the  time  the Mexicans hold their next  presidential election wewill  not have  this  reciprocal  lending  facility.  That would be  onecriterion  I would set  up.Another relates  to  the  fact  that  there  are only a very fewcurrencies  that  serve as major  standards  of  value in  the world andevery other  currency is  defined  in  terms  of  those currencies.  One  ofthose,  the  deutsche mark, is  slated to  go away in  a couple  of  years.I think the  kind of  arrangement  that we have with other major centralbanks whose  currency competes with the  dollar as  an  internationalstandard of  value is  one thing, and  the  arrangements  that we have witheverybody else is  something else again.  Central banks areproliferating all  over  the world--in Tajikistan and places  I can'teven pronounce.  I hope  that my worst fears  about  the new Europeancentral bank and  the new euro currency prove not  to be warranted, butI believe we  need  to  think very carefully, starting now, about whatkind of  arrangements we will want  to have with that  central bank andwhat  kind of  transactions we will be willing to  engage in with it.There also  are questions pertaining to  those  European countries  thatthe  euro club and the  European central bank.  What kind ofarrangements  are  they going to  want  to have with us,  and are  theyarrangements  that we  are going to  want  to  have with them?  I thinkthis  is  an extremely important  issue.  We do not  have a lot  of  time,but we ought  to  put  it  in  that  context  so  that we  finish thismillennium with something quite different  from what we have  today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  On a very basic  level,  it  seems  to  me  that weought  to  welcome  the  respect  and the  leadership role  that  the world,as  Mr. McDonough pointed out,  seems very willing  to  accord us  and weought  to  work as  closely as  possible with  the other major  centralbanks to  keep things  on  an even keel  and avoid  financial crises.  Forthat purpose, it  seems  to  me that,  as  the world gets more  complicated,we probably are going  to  need a quite  flexible set  of  instruments  anda quite  flexible set  of  groupings  of  countries  that we  deal with indifferent  ways.  I am persuaded by  the  staff paper  that  the currentswaps are probably an obsolete  instrument, but  I would be  very worried7/2-3/96-103-about eliminating  them before we are much  surer about  the  kind  ofstructure we want going forward.  I think we need to  rethink that verycarefully, and we need to  do  it  in the  light  of  a couple  sets  ofpolitical  sensitivities.One set  is  the  concerns  of  our  friends  and  allies around  theworld who  are very worried, as  I perceive  it,  that  the  United Statesinward-looking, to-hell-with-the-rest-of-the-world stance  at  themoment  and  that we  are  drawing back on  foreign aid and not paying ourbills  that are  due  to  international  organizations.  If  we were to  getrid of  our  swap lines,  that might  be seen  as  one more  indication thatwe  are withdrawing  from the world.  I do  not  think anybody around thistable wants to  do  that.  The  other  set  of  political  sensitivities  isexactly the  one  to which  those people are responding--theCongressional  set  of  fears  that somehow we  are going to  become moreentangled.  So,  as we  structure  a new set  of  relationships,  I think wehave  to  be  very careful,  first,  that  they  are not  seen  as  foreign aidbut as  mutual  arrangements  among central banks  to  avoid world crisis.They must not  be viewed as  give-aways because  that would create  someproblem for  anything that  is  an  extension of  credit.  Second,  thesearrangements  should not be  seen as  obscure,  as  the mysterious  gettingtogether of  central  bankers who might be  thought  to be up  to no  good.Politically, it  seems  to  me that we have  a very sensitive set  ofissues  that we  have  to work our way through very carefully.  I for onewould think the  first  thing is  to  do no harm and not overturn  theexisting arrangements  even  though they may not be very modern ones.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I think the  history of  the  swap  arrangementssince the  early 1980s  indicates  that  there  is  no need  for  them.Somewhat  in  answer  to  Governor Rivlin's  concerns,  it would seem  to methat  there  may be political  reasons  for wanting to  substitutesomething, but  I think history has indicated  that when it  comes  to  theeconomic and financial  considerations,  a substitute mechanism reallyis  not  required.  In  addition,  the more  recent experience  that we  havehad,  I think, is  another  item on  the  side  of  the  ledger  in support  ofthe view that  we do  not need this  type  of  arrangement.  So, withoutgetting into what one perhaps  should substitute or  just  add to  it,  Idon't  see where  the  case  is  at  all  strong  that we need our swap  lines.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, as  you know, I have registeredmy discomfort with  swap  arrangements  for  some  time,  beginning with myvotes  against the  renewal  of  a number of  these arrangements  in  late1994.  Essentially,  I think swap arrangements  are undesirable becausetheir primary purpose  is  to  facilitate  foreign exchange  intervention,and I do not like  foreign exchange intervention.  I believe  itcompromises  or  threatens  to  compromise the  conduct  of  monetary policyfor reasons  I have  outlined here  before.  Just  in two  brief summarysentences:  I think intervention undermines  the  credibility ofmonetary policy by introducing some confusion  as  to  what  ourfundamental  objectives are  as  between domestic  price stability  andexchange rate  objectives  at  particular points  in  time.  Secondly, Ithink some  foreign exchange  operations could over time underminepublic  support  for the  Fed's  financial  independence, which is  the7/2-3/96-104-ultimate  foundation  for  our credibility.  So,  I would favordiscontinuing  the  swap network.  I was  encouraged by the memorandum,which I also  thought was very well  done, because  I sensed  from it  thata number of  other central banks may also  share these  sentiments.Obviously, if  we were to  do  this,  there would be  some  transitionproblems  and  some  technical difficulties  and perhaps  some perceptiondifficulties  in actually getting it  done.  I do not  want to  minimizethose, but  I think that  if we  confront them we  can  deal with  them.As  far as  the  timing is  concerned, I would agree  that  if wecould in  some way tie  this  in with the EMU,  that  would be  great.However, Tom Hoenig said it  well;  we  do  not know what that  timing isgoing  to be  and I would not want to  wait for  that.With regard to  the question  that you raised and that  the memoraises with respect  to replacing  the swap  lines--if we do  dismantlethem--with some other  kind of credit  facility, I do  not have  answers,just questions.  There are  a lot  of  questions  that  we would need toask and try  to get answers  to.  Let  me just  highlight the  ones  that  Ibelieve would be most  compelling.  If  we are going  to do  somethinglike this,  we need to  be very clear as  to  the  reason.  There may be avalid reason, but we as  a Committee  would need to understand  it  asclearly as possible, and  that would involve some  discussion.  Thenthere would be the mechanical  issues having to  do with whether  to  havelimits on  credit  extensions  either with respect  to  amount  or  to  whomthe loans  might be made, how frequently  they might be made,  what  theapproval  process would be, and so  forth.  I think we would have  toestablish those  terms  very carefully.  There also would be questionsabout  collateral.  We would need  to decide  how what would beacceptable collateral  and how it  would be valued.  Finally, and Iguess most  importantly,  if we were  to  do  something  like  this,  we wouldneed to  try to  design it  in a way where we would not be  seen  as  in anyway misusing our off-budget  status  to make  loans  to  foreigngovernments  that could open us up  to  the  kind of  charges we  got whenwe made the  Mexican loan.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have to  admit mygeneral  skepticism regarding  the  effectiveness of  intervention  as  ameans of  permanently affecting  the value  of  the  dollar.  I do  thinkthat  there  are times  when  other smaller  countries may be  able to  useintervention policies appropriately  to  affect  their currencies.  So,it  seems  to  me that  the usefulness  of  swap  lines  for  the United Statesenvironment,  and we may need to  be  able  to respond  to  the  needs  ofother countries.  We  also  are not  the  only government  institutionmaking  this policy.  To  the  extent  that  the  Treasury,  for  example,we need to have  the  appropriate  capabilities.  I am not sure  that swaplines  are  the most  efficient means  of  effecting these kinds  oftransactions.  I am not  even sure  that  repos  or  reverse repos  are theonly other kinds  of  financial  instruments  that we  could use.  Isuspect  that  in today's marketplace,  there may be  a wider range  ofinstruments  that  could be  used, and before we come  to  a finalconclusion, we need  to  be thinking  about where we want  to  go asopposed to  eliminating one procedure  and having nothing  to  replace  it.Whatever adjustments  are made, I hope  that we would not be  seen as7/2-3/96 -105-withdrawing from the  international  arena.  I think the  Fed should bean  active participant  in  the  formulation of  U.S. policy.  We  shouldhave  a place at  the  table.  I do  think  that the  Fed providescontinuity in  the  international  financial  arena  on behalf  of  theUnited States.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I have never been completely clearas  to  exactly what  kind of  an  obligation these  swap lines  were.  Whatare we  obliged  to  do?  It  seems  to  me  that whenever there  is  alikelihood  that  a central bank will want  to  draw on  its  swap  line,that  involves  a full-blown discussion and negotiation anyway.  A  swapagreement  is not  a right  to  automatic  credit  as  I understand it.  As  aconsequence,  it  strikes me  that  its very  existence may tend  over  timeto  be more  awkward than helpful  if  other  central banks presume  thatthere  is  a right  to  credit which may turn out not  to  be  desirable  fromour perspective at  the  time  the  drawing  is  requested.  So,  for  thatreason and others  that  have been mentioned here,  it  seems  to  me  thatit would be  a good  idea  for us  to  start moving  slowly away from  ourswap agreements.An additional  dimension  that  I don't  think I heard mentionedhere  and that  seems  relevant  to  me would be  the new level  ofparticipation and  capability of  the private sector  to  perform a lot  ofthese  functions.  We recently went through  an  interesting pattern withthe  Brady negotiations and  the  structure  that  came out  of  that.  Veryrecently, there  have  been interesting negotiations with Mexico  thatinvolved a third-party, private-sector group.  I think  that  that  is  anappropriate consideration as  well.I would like  to  reiterate  two  things  that  Governor Rivlin andothers have  said.  First, we probably should have  some  idea of wherewe  want to  go  before we  leave  where we are.  The  second point  is  thatI believe  this  is  at  least as  much a political  as  it  is  a financialconsideration.  As  a consequence, as  soon  as  we have  our  thinkingtogether,  I think we  should begin to move very slowly and carefullyout  of  these arrangements  and to  do  so  in the context  of  a broad rangeof  considerations  and  discussions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  One possibility is  that we  could movethis  forward  if,  for  example,  the  Vice Chairman and I at  meetings inBasle unofficially sounded out  our counterparts  concerning their viewsof  these  swaps  agreements.  It  is  very important  for  us  to  know ifthey think  these  are  useless and obsolete  appendages  to  theinternational  financial  system  as distinct  from a measure  of  embraceby the United States  reflecting  the United States'  view of  the moralsuperiority of  our  counterparties.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  If  we were  to  assume  a world  inwhich  the  swap network no  longer  existed, would any formal  mechanismhave  to be  created to  replace it?  My  own working hypothesis  on thatwould be  "no."  In my view, what would replace  it  is  what  in  a wayalready replaces  it.  A good many of us  spend a fair  amount of  ourtime--I  spend essentially  10  percent  of  my  time--attending BISmeetings.  I don't do  that because  I like  the  Basle Hilton,  I canassure you, but rather because  of  the  close personal relationshipsthat  come  from that activity.  What  that means  is  that  if  we have a7/2-3/96-106-problem with any  of  the people  that  the Chairman sees,  say,  at  fourmeetings  a year and I see  at  ten meetings  a year, we are  talking withsomeone we know very well.  So  what replaces  the  swap network is  thatpersonal  relationship.  It  does  not mean that we do  them a favor  orthey do  us  a favor.  What  it  does  is  to  make it  possible for  twoindividuals representing  their  central  banks  to  agree on what  is  inthe mutual  interest  of  their  central banks  and more  importantly theircountries.If  we ever got  into a situation  in which it  was necessary todo  something, including a reverse repo  with, say,  Germany, I thinknone  of  us would worry about whether  there was  a politicalconsideration or  a creditworthiness  consideration.  Germany is,  ofcourse,  a very easy example.  We would do  the  financial  transactiononly  if  it  were very clear  that  it  was  in  the  interest  of Germany  andin the  interest  of  the United States.  As  long as we keep  a very closecontrol  on  it,  as  has been suggested,  then the  risk factor  is  very,very  low.  Now, what  that  kind of  approach to  the world requires  is  agreat  deal  of  effort  in  figuring out which of  the  central banks  of  theworld are  important enough  for  us  to  spend the  amount of  time neededto  get  to know the people who run  them as  well  as  we know some  of  ourbest  friends  in Europe.  That  is  a lot  of work.  I think one  of  thereasons  that you, Mr.  Chairman, wanted to concentrate  on  the  overallaspects  of  this  issue  is  that  the people who work  on  this  a lot  likeTed, Peter, and Terry  Checki from  the New York Bank could perhaps  bethinking of  taking a look at whether, because of  our rather  disparateorganization, we have missed some  obvious  candidates.  I think we werea bit  slow in  taking the  Southeast  Asia central banks  seriously.  SanFrancisco was doing a good job on  it;  we were a little  slow in NewYork, no  question.  I think Board  staff was  taking an  interest  inthem.  But we certainly have  stepped up  the degree of  time andattention that we  are  spending on  those people,  I think veryappropriately.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I start  out with some  fairly basic views.  Ithink that we have  to be  involved in  the world and that we  have  toprovide  leadership at  times.  That  means  doing all  the  thingsnecessary  to  build personal  and institutional relationships  to  supportour  involvement.  Whether one views  intervention  in the  foreignexchange markets  as desirable  or not,  I will  guarantee,  absolutelyguarantee,  that  there will  come  a time when intervention is  going tobe  something  that we  need to  do.  There may be very transitory reasonsfor  the  intervention and its  effects may fade away over  time,  butthere will be  circumstances at  some point where we will  simply have  toengage  in intervention  operations.  As  a practical  matter, we willthen  need to  have  the ammunition to participate.  While we may haveforeign currency reserves now that  permit us  to  do  that, we will  alsoneed ways  to  back up  those reserves  to  get  the necessary liquidity.Whether it  is  swaps  or  something  else, we will  have to  be  in aposition to do  those  things that  are necessary for us  to  sit  at  thetable  and be effective players.  The view that we  can somehow pullourselves  out  of  the  foreign exchange markets  for  all  time,  that wecan  somehow let  the world go,  is  just  completely at  odds with the  kindof  financial  structure  that we  have  on  a global basis  and our  role  init.  If we  are going  to play, we  need to  have  the  tools.7/2-3/96-107-

MR. BOEHNE.  I am not arguing  about whether we need  the  swapsper  se.  I am just  saying  that we need the means.  If we  can  improveon  the  swaps  mechanism or  find other ways,  that  is  fine with me.  I donot think we  ought  to  give  them up until we are  sure we have somethingelse.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman, I found a lot  on my plate  as  Iprepared for this  meeting, and you were  the  chef!  [Laughter]Absorbing the memo on  swaps  got me very close to  a form  ofintellectual  indigestion.  So  I am not prepared to  take  a very firmposition at  this  time,  but  I do want  to  share a few initialimpressions.  First,  the current  swap network certainly  appears  to  befor  the most  part an historical  relic.  In her comments,  Cathy saidthat this  may be  fortuitous,  and that reminded me  of a mutual  fundprospectus  stating that past performance  is  no  guarantee  of  futurereturns.  That may be  the  case here.  However, the  staff memocertainly left me with the  impression  that not only have these  swaps,except  in  the  case  of  Mexico, not  been used since  1982,  but  in  thestaff's  judgment  there  was  no particular prospect  that  they would beused  for  the  foreseeable  future.  So,  eliminating  the  swaps  would belike paperwork reduction,  the  303  streamlining that we  are  engaged  in.Why do we have  to  meet every year  and renew these  arrangements when weknow they are not going to  be used?The main case  for retaining  them  seems  to  be that  it  is  notvery costly, and there  might be  some political  cost  in  dismantlingthem because we could be perceived as  disengaging  or not being acooperative member of  the  team.  Now, while the  topic here  ispresumably swaps,  that  is  not  really what we  are  talking  about  for  themost part.  We really  are  talking about whether or  not we  believe inintervention in  the  exchange markets and how we  feel  about  emergencyactions when  there  are payments system crises as  in  the  case  ofMexico.  That  is  the  real  issue despite  the  fact  that  the  swapagreements  have nothing  to  do  with intervention in  foreign exchangesome point down  the  road.  Even  that remains  to  be  seen.  I am notgoing to  reach any judgment at  this point about  intervention in  theforeign exchange markets.  I will  say that  I start  out with a degreeof  skepticism, but  I am not  so  skeptical  that  I would remove thispolicy option from the  table  at  this point.With respect  to  the  situation  of  Mexico,  it  is  interestingthat  their drawing is  the  only example  of  the use  of  our  swap  linerecently, and it  is  precisely that use  that  is  the main reason whysome people want  to  scrap  the  swap  line network.  This  might have beenan ugly way of dealing with  the problem, but  it  may be  that  there wereno  less ugly options  available.  Again,  I want  to  withhold judgment  onthat.In  terms  of  RPs  and the merits of  reverse RPs,  I absolutelywithhold any judgment  on  those  issues  until  I have  learned much moreabout those  instruments.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.7/2-3/96-108-

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I agree  that  the  swap  arrangementsare by and large a legacy of  times  past  and may have become  somethingof  an anachronism.  But  even if  these arrangements  have become  largelysymbolic,  they do  seem to  me  to be an  important  symbol  of  ourcommitment  to  international  cooperation.  Here I agree particularlywith Governor Rivlin and President  Boehne.  I think  it  would bedangerous simply  to  dismantle  these arrangements  in  a way that  createsinternational  tension.  I do not  really  see  these arrangements  asdangerous.  I understand the  principle that  President  Broaddus  hasenunciated as  to why they  could be dangerous  to  our ability to  conductan  independent monetary policy, but  I think that  fear  is  overblown.  Iagree with President  Boehne that  they could even  be helpful  onoccasion in  the  future.I would support  the  suggestion that you made, Mr. Chairman,that  it might be wise  to  look  for an  opportunity in Basle  or  elsewhereto  discuss  the  future  of  these  arrangements quietly with our  centralbank partners and to  see  what their  reactions would be.  I would notwant  to  see needless tension  created here.  I also  agree that  beforewe have  those conversations,  it  would be wise  to  figure out  where wemight want  to  go  in  the  future  to be able  to  react  to  suggestions  thatwe  replace these  arrangements with  something else.  With respect  to  asystem of  repo  and reverse repo-type  arrangements,  I think  that  is  apossibility that  is well  worth exploring.  But I would agree also withPresident Broaddus's  list  of  the questions  that would need to beaddressed and answered.  What do  we see  as  the  fundamental purpose?Is  it  to  guard against  systemic risk?  Is  it  a service  to  our allies?Is  it  for our  own  reserve management needs?  Will we  do  transactionson  demand?  Is  this  a privilege?  Is  this  a right?  Are there  limits?With whom do we  intend to  deal?  What criteria will  we use  to decidewhich countries?  I think Governor Kelley's question about privatewe become  increasingly large players  in  this  area  is  a question thatwe  should explore  along with the  broad  issue of  the  governancestructure  if  we proceed.  We need to  work out who will make  thegood opportunity  for  the  staff  to  go home  and do  some work.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  It  seems  obvious  that  the  original purpose  forestablishing  the  swap  arrangements  is  no  longer as  relevant as  it  oncewas.  I do not  think this  necessarily means  that we  shouldunilaterally dismantle  the  swap  lines.  They are  reciprocalarrangements.  If  our  counterparts  sense that we no  longer have  anyneed for  the  swap  lines,  then  it  might be  appropriate to  begin thediscussions  on how best  to proceed with disassembling them withoutunnecessary adverse reactions.  Mr. Chairman, I think your  suggestionof  the  informal  discussions  that you and the Vice Chairman would havewith other central  bankers at  Basle and  elsewhere  is  a very goodinitial  step.  In  the process  as we  are  thinking this  through, wecertainly should explore alternative  arrangements  to  see  if  they areneeded  to better reflect the  current state  of  the  internationalexchange markets,  the role  we should play, and whether the  swaps  areneeded at  all.  There  are many issues  involved, and I agree withGovernor Yellen  that we  should send  the  staff back  to do  some morework on  this,  including the private market aspect  that  Governor Kelleymentioned.  I think  this  should be  included in  the broader study of7/2-3/96-109-intervention and the  types  of  tools  that we would use  if  interventionis  called  for  in  the  future.  I agree with  President Boehne  that  theodds are pretty high  that we will  be  called on  to  do somethingsometime  in  the coming years.On  the EMU point,  I do  not think we  should wait  to  see  if  EMUbecomes  a reality before we begin this  effort,  although we clearlywould have  an opportunity at  that  time  for  implementing any change andadjustments  that we need.  I also  think this  is  an  area where closecooperation  is  going  to be needed between the Federal  Reserve,  theTreasury, and other affected central  banks and governments.  It  maybe, as  someone  said, that  this  is more of  a political  decision than  aneconomic  decision in some  respects.  Our independence may be betterenhanced  if  we  take  a leadership role  on this  issue  rather than justunilaterally terminating  these swap  arrangements.  We  certainly do  notwant  to  add to  the  concern  that  the  United States  is  no  longerexercising  leadership  in  the international  community.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I am certainly no  advocate  of  withdrawing fromthe world,Two  issues  have been raised.  The first  has to  do with what  Iwould call  the dual  purposes here, which is  concern about withdrawalfrom the  world versus a domestic political  consideration.  As  somemembers have  emphasized in  this discussion,  there  certainly will comea time  in  the  future when we will wish to  be in  a position tointervene in  foreign  exchange markets.  I am sure  that will  happen.We have managed to  intervene  in  foreign exchange markets  quite  a bit.I can't  think of  any instance  since  I have been here when we reallyhad to  intervene.  It  certainly was not  because of  an emergency or  afinancial  crisis.  As  I recall,  every time we  intervened the  reasonreally came  down to  what was  in effect  a domestic  politicalconsideration.  Some  major trading partner had too high a currency ortoo  low a currency or  something of  that nature and that was  the  realmotivation.  It was  not a systemic risk situation.  There was noquestion about systemic  risk.  In every  instance that  we can think of,except perhaps  for  some hypothetical developments  in the  future, weknow why intervention is  being used.  It  has nothing  to  do withsystemic  risk;  it  is  an arm of  the domestic political  apparatus,  and Ido not  like  that.  I do  not  think  that  is what we are  here  for,  and Ithink there  are risks  to  this  institution  if  we play  that  game.We  really have  to  think about  two  issues.  The  first,  as hasbeen mentioned,  is  the  list  of  countries with which we want  to  conductthese  transactions,  and related to  that is  the question of whether  ornot  the  other currency is  a major  store of  value.  Mr. Chairman, youindicated that we  should exclude  countries where  the  State Departmentdoes not want  U.S.  citizens  to  travel.  I do not  think we need  arepurchase  agreement with North Korea or Cuba, and  I do not  know whereelse we  cannot travel,  so  I think that  is  too  small  a list  of  excludedcountries.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  These are  repurchases  involving U.S.Treasury securities.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  All right,  let  us pick the  case  of  a repurchaseagreement with China.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In dollars.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  In dollars.  Let  us  think about  the odds  thatthe  transaction would be used to prevent systemic  contagion  to theU.S.  banking system versus  the odds  that  it  would be  used for domesticpolitical  considerations because  the Chinese  are selling us  too manyshirts  or whatever it  is.  Do  you want  to give me  the  odds  on that?  Iknow which way it  is  going  to come  out.  The only place where  I thinkthe  issue  gets really difficult  is  with  the yen, which does  serve as  atrue world  store of  value  currency.  Even  in  that  case,  it  can stillbe  used for domestic political  considerations.  So,  I think we have  todraw the net very tightly on  countries  with which we will  undertake  todo  these  transactions.  I believe the way to  think  of  this  is  in termsof  the  probability that we may need to  intervene  for good reasonsversus  purely domestic political  considerations.The  second issue  is  one of  duration.  I do  not remember anydiscussion of  this  although, Bill,  you did allude to  it.  We  couldhave a two-day reverse repo  or  a three-day reverse  repo,  but  if werenew it  100  times,  it  suddenly becomes what  I would call  a realextension  of credit.  I would  suggest  that we think  hard about  thatissue;  that  would be  one  of  the  clearer lines  in  the  sand  that wewould have  to  draw.  I remember in  our discussion  of  the Mexicanbailout  that  we all  knew we were going a bit  out  on a limb for  a year.We viewed  that as  a long  time,  and we certainly did not  want  to gobeyond a year.  If  we  are  going to  focus  on  this  and we want  to avoidthe  appearance of  an extension  of  credit,  I would  think that  theduration has  to be a lot  less  than a year.  Maybe  it  should be  amatter of  weeks.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I would be  astounded,  since youaddressed the question to  me,  if  the  duration were more  than  a fewdays.  My main motivation for getting  the reverse repo  capability forthe Desk  is  that  I do not want  to  deprive  us,  the  FOMC,  of  a usefultool  for  our  own purposes.  I am not really motivated by the  objectiveof  helping other central  banks around  the world.  A problem thatsometime  arises in our  dealings with some  of  the  Southeast Asian bankswhen they ask if  we can do a reverse repo.  They understand  fully thenature of  that  financial  instrument.  When we say,  "No, we can't  dothose,"  they  think it  implies,  because a country competitive with usis  encouraging  them to  have that  view, that we are  not  a cooperativecentral  bank.  It  is  not  that  they are  saying they want us  to do  it.They are not  asking for  any kind of  an arrangement.  It  is  that theyare  thinking:  Why  in  the world would a central bank not be  able  to  do7/2-3/96-111-what would appear  to be  a completely normal  transaction  in  its  ownTreasury securities  in  its  own currency when it  can do  those  any dayof  the week with Salomon Brothers?  I have constructed answers  to  suchquestions, but  in  fact  it  is not very comfortable  to  have  to  answerthem.  So,  I would like  to be  able  to  say  that we have  that  technicalcapability, but  they should not  in  any way have  the view that weintend  to use it.  They have  access  to  all  those Street  firms  thatMike Kelley  referred to  and  they should go  and do  their business withthem.  All  kinds of  people  are eager  to  do  business with those  centralbanks,  and  that  is  where  it  ought  to  be  done.  On the  other hand, ournot  having that  tool  available  to  us  is  a product  of  the  fact  that  inthe  1970s,  whenever it  was, nobody thought we would need it,  so we  didnot  get  it.  No  one  can recall  a policy decision on  this matter, butrather  it  appears  to have been a case where nobody  thought of  it  assomething  that might be  needed.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I agree.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I have just  a couple of  comments.  I think swapshave outlived  their usefulness.  My recollection is  that  one  of  theproblems we have  encountered with them is  that  foreign central bankshave wanted to  draw on  their swap  lines  at  times we did not think itwas  such  a good idea.  I remember some balance sheet window-dressingon  the part  of  a country whose name has  already been mentioned acouple of  times here.  That places  us  in a dilemma.  They come  to uswith the  expectation that  they are going to  be able  to make thedrawing.  Do we  want to  say no, given  that  the  facility is  in place?It  gets  to be very difficult.  So,  I would think that  we ought  to  tryto  extricate ourselves,  as  gracefully as possible,  over  time  fromthese arrangements.In terms  of where we might  go,  I have  some  sympathy in  theabstract  for  the  flexible  approach based on personal  relations  thatBill McDonough was  talking about.  But this  is politically sensitivestuff.  There is  no  escaping,  it  seems  to me,  that  these arrangementsand transactions  are politically sensitive.  Where  that  leads me  is  tothe  view that we need  some principles with regard  to  what we  areprepared to  do,  under what circumstances, with whom, when, and so  on.It  may be  that,  in  extremis,  we will  need to  interpret  thoseprinciples  flexibly, but  I assume  those  situations would be rare.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I am  not a fan  of  intervention by  the UnitedStates  in foreign  exchange markets, and in any event we probably donot need  swap arrangements  for  that purpose.  However, our swappartners  might have  such  a need, so  I am not  sure what we would gainby giving up the  flexibility to  accommodate  that need before  we havean  alternative in mind.  I would  look  for alternatives  and keep  theswaps  around until  we  have one.Just a word on Mexico:  Nobody  liked the way the Mexicansupport package was put  together and it  was  certainly ugly.  But  Istill believe  that we  did the  right  thing, and it  appears  that  it  hasworked and is  working and will  be  successful.  I would keep  the  swaparrangement around so  that  it will be available  in the  next  crisis.7/2-3/96-112-The  idea  of hurrying to dismantle  it  before another crisis  occurswhere we might use  it  does  not  appeal  to me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I cannot  add anything that has not  alreadybeen  said on  the  swaps  issue.  I do want  to  say that  I have a lot  ofsympathy for what  Bill  McDonough  said in  terms of how we  ought  to  bethinking about this  issue  looking  forward.  We ought  to  focus  onmaking  sure  that we maintain the U.S.  dollar as  the principal  reservecurrency, and we ought  to be  thinking of  vehicles that  support  thatobjective.  That  is  really how I view what Bill  is  saying in  anenvironment  where we are  apt  to  have  larger  and larger cross-bordersettlements  and the  need for  liquidity on  relatively short notice.The  ability to provide  the  latter would certainly be  in our  interest.People are going  to  look to us  to make  sure that  dollar settlementsthroughout  the world are  in  fact made.  We  ought  to be  thinking interms  of  a vehicle  that  helps  facilitate that.  So,  I think our  focusought  to be  shifted away from supporting  foreign exchange  interven-tion,  and  I think swaps are  an  anachronism in  that  context in anyevent.  We  should be moving more  toward payments  system risk aspectsand really  supporting the  U.S. dollar.  That  is  what  this  ought  to beabout  as we  think about  the  future.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  comments?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I just want  to reiterate what Gary Stern  saidbefore.  For better or  for worse, my understanding of  the way  swapswork  is  that  there  is  an activation process  of  some  sort  and then anactual use.  There  are principles and rules that  apply and so  on.  Ithink we need to  be very flexible  as  we move  forward, and I think weought  to  be responsive as  a central  bank.  We need to be  aware of  thepolitical nature  of  these  transactions, particularly  in the  reverserepo situation where there  is  at  least  a debate about whether  it  isthe  same kind of  extension of  credit  that  ended up being debated.Accordingly,  I think we  need to  have  a fairly  firm set  of principlesunder which we would operate  and that would not  vary a great  deal,except  in  extremis,  from country to  country.  Those principles wouldbe  something  that we would talk about  in  advance of actually providingdollars.  I am a little nervous about extreme  flexibility because  Ithink  it  could lead into  difficulty  for us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further remarks  or  questions?  If  notunless  I hear an  objection, I think we probably ought  to move  forwardand see  whether we  can get  some  responses  on  this general  issue  fromour counterparties  and bring those  observations  back to  the Committeethe  next time we  discuss  this  operation.  Is  that okay with everybody?
