CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Good morning,  everyone.  Would somebody like to moveapproval  of the minutes for the August  19  meeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So move.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Peter Fisher.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to thefour pages  of colored charts  in front of you under the Class II cover.  1 Onthe first page are  current 3-month  deposit rates  and  3-,  6-,  and  9-monthforward,  3-month deposit rates  that for the United States  are shown in red,for Germany  in blue,  and for Japan in green.  Looking  at the U.S.  forwardrates,  you can  see that there has  been relatively  little net  change  since theCommittee's last meeting.  Indeed,  after rising during August, the forwardrates are  now back to around their levels  at the time of the August meetingand almost back to the recent  lows they reached  at the very end of July.The single biggest decline  in  U.S.  forward rate expectations  came  on therelease of the August CPI on September  16.  That followed a smallerannounced.  Looking at these rates  going back to  late March  and given theirrecent  declines,  I see relatively  little, if any, pricing in of expected furtheraction by the  Committee in the months ahead.Looking  down to the German  forward rates shown  in blue, you  can seethat the rise in German rate expectations  that began earlier  in the summerhas continued.  While both German  and some other  European data havebeen  somewhat firmer, I believe the bigger  impact on German rateexpectations  has come from  the rather  loud whisper campaign  that theBundesbank  has directed  at financial  markets.  The message in effect is thatin order for the European monetary  union  to work, German  and Italianshort-end rates will  have to  meet somewhere  in between  their current  levels.With the  German  short-end rates  now around  3 percent  and Italian short-end rates  around  6 to 6-1/2 percent,  this implies  a 150 basis point rise forGermany and  a 150 basis point decline  for Italy.  The rather public  whispercampaign  has been driving German rate expectations  up, and you canobserve  on the right side of the chart the rather pronounced  upward  shiftfollowing  the ECOFIN meeting the  weekend of September  13  and  14.Looking  at the Japanese  forward rates  in  the bottom panel,  you can seethat the various  forward rate maturities  have  continued to  collapse on top of1 Copies of the charts used by Mr. Fisher are  appended to this document  (Appendix  1).9/30/97 2the current rate.  The release of the  11.2 percent  (annual rate) decline  insecond-quarter GDP added  to the  gloom in Tokyo.  Rather than try to parseout the green muddle  of rates  at the  bottom of the chart, let me observe  thatthe 9-month forward,  3-month  yen  deposit rate now trades  at 3  basis pointsover the overnight Libor rate.  The JGB  benchmark yield has traded downto  1.86 percent in the last couple of days.  These relative shifts  in interestrate  expectations  have had  a fairly predictable  impact on exchange markets,with the yen  depreciating  about  2-1/2 percent and the mark appreciatingabout  5-1/2  percent against  the dollar since August  1.  I think this impact onthe dollar-mark  exchange  rate is precisely what the Bundesbank  had inmind when  it engineered its  whisper  campaign.Turning to the second  page, you can see that recent developments  had asomewhat  more complex  impact on bond markets.  The four panels on this3-month  deposit rates implied by the FRAs  and in  10-year governmentbond yields.  In the upper  left panel,  you can see  the  story of U.S.  interestrate markets  as the red lines move across the chart.  We had  the rally in Julyfollowed by the upward spike  in early August.  There was little net changesubsequently until  the more recent rally  associated with the release  of thethe persistent decline in  Japanese rates,  both for  10-year bonds  and forwardinterest rate expectations,  is evident.  In the  bottom left chart for Germany,we see  a different  pattern of interest rate  movements throughout the period.The 9-month forward  3-month  deposit rate  has risen by 72 basis pointssince  July  1, while the  10-year bond has traded more  or less sideways;  itrallied a little in  September,  declining  18  basis points in yield.The truly  dramatic impact of the Bundesbank's whisper campaign  wasfelt in Italian interest rate markets where participants  heard  the Bundesbankto be saying  three things:  First, the Bundesbank  would be raising rates.Secondly,  the Bundesbank  was  so convinced that Italy would be in EMUthat they were prepared  to act on that basis.  And third, the Bundesbankthought it would be  an EMU-friendly act  for the Bank of Italy to lower rates150 basis  points.  As shown in the  panel at the bottom right, the 9-monthforward  3-month lira deposit rate declined  by  125 basis points  from thebeginning of August through  last Friday  and there  was  a similar decline inthe  10-year bond yield.  One of the questions that have  come out of thisexperience  is how to explain the  stability  in long-term German  interestrates.  From Frankfurt,  the markets have heard  that when central banks withreal credibility threaten  to raise rates, the long end of their yield curve9/30/97remains stable  or rallies.  And much to my surprise,  a great number  ofalternative  view to  which I am somewhat  partial.  It begins by noting thatover the  last several  years the Bundesbank  has been  of the view that thelong end  of their yield curve has  followed  the lead of the U.S.  and  theglobal bond markets,  and it has not really  followed expected  changes  inshort-term  German  interest rates.  The pattern of the solid blue line forGermany  does have some echo  of the  solid red line  for the United  States.One could also note that relative to U.S. and Japanese  10-year rates,German rates have  backed up by 25 basis  points since  the beginning of thesummer.  So, I think there is some excitement yet to  play through  inEuropean  bond markets  as we  move forward toward EMU.The third page  of charts  shows  percent changes  in  equity indices for thesecond and  third quarters  of 1997.  I have included  that chart to make twoobvious  points.  First, equity markets were  somewhat  more volatile in thethird  quarter than  in the  second.  Also, there  was  a much greater diversity ofoutcomes  in the  third quarter.  That is true globally and  also if we look atsome of the internal comparisons.  For example,  the NASDAQ  performancewas quite different from that of the Dow.  The Milan MlBtel,  the GermanDax, and the French CAC all  had quite different outcomes  and, of course,the Tokyo  Topix and its construction  sector, reflecting  the Japanesedomestic economy,  also turned in rather different performances  than otherequity indices.Turning to domestic  open market operations,  the  daily effective  federalfunds rate  averaged about  5.55  percent over the intermeeting  period, a littlehigher than the  intended rate.  This  outcome reflected  principally  a fewdays  of elevated  funds rates.  I'm not going  to take you through all thedetail  on these charts, but I did want to make a point.  The vertical bluelines in  the top panel  show the daily range of federal  funds trading;  thehorizontal  red  lines are  the daily effective  rate;  the vertical red linesrepresent  one standard  deviation  in the volume of federal  funds trading eachday and  give a sense  of the concentration  or dispersion of funds trading.The middle  panel shows our misses, that is, the actual  level of free  reservesless the  intended level; the yellow bars indicate negative  misses  and theblue bars  show positive misses.  In the bottom panel,  you see  operatingbalances  as they occurred each day.My reason  for showing this chart is to  focus on three  days in Septemberth, and  17th--and  to point outon the right hand  side of the page--the  15th, 16that neither changes  in  operating balances alone nor even  our misses ofsome  size really tell us everything  we might want know about what drivesvolatility in  the federal  funds  market.  The  15th, 16th, and  17th werecorporate tax payment  dates.  On  the  15th, you can  see that we had anelevated effective rate on the day but a very narrow effective range,  as9/30/97funds in a very  narrow range.  However,  looking at the middle  panel for the15th, we  had a rather sizable  miss of $2  billion on that day.  Even  so, we hada relatively  contained  federal funds rate.  On the  16th, the effective  rate wasright on the target  at 5-1/2 percent.  The one  standard deviation  tradingrange was somewhat  wider on that day, but we  again had a miss and,  if youlook at the bottom of the page,  a very low operating balance.  In fact, wealmost hit the historic  low operating balance,  but we did not have a terriblyth,volatile day or upward  pressure in the  funds market.  The next day,  the  17funds traded over a quite  wide range at rates up to  15  percent  and the onestandard deviation  volume  of trading was much wider.  We had a very largemiss  and again a low operating  balance.The difference  between  the  16th and the  17th was in the distribution  ofreserves, with the need falling  on the large regional  banks  whose behaviorpattern tends to be to bid up  the funds rate.  So in this case,  the behavior  ofthose banks determined  the volatility  of the funds rate  a great deal morethan the level of operating  balance  or even the size  of our miss.  I do notwant to overstate  that, but I think it is  a significant  point to emphasize.  Thelevel of the operating  balance  is not the only factor.Since your last meeting, we have conducted two legs of outrightpurchase operations,  both in  the coupon sector.  The bill market remainsquite tight, and I have been reluctant to enter that market.  So, I expect tocontinue to operate  in the coupon  market.  There  is  some possibility thatwith the new  fiscal year the Treasury will  be issuing a larger amount  of billsand we will be  able to return to bill purchases.Mr.  Chairman,  there were  no foreign exchange  operations for theSystem account during  the period since the August meeting.  I will need theCommittee's  ratification  of our domestic  open  market operations.  I wouldbe happy to  answer any questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Peter?

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  A quick question, Peter.  It seems to me that our key concern aboutintra-day funds rate  volatility would be the possibility that we would  give the wrong signal  tohave a different impression.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No,  I do not.  I think the market understands  as well as any of us theimplications of low  operating balances  and how they may  foster market volatility on some days.9/30/97So, no, I don't think such volatility  has had any  effect on policy expectations.  Don  and I haveworried that it might  at some point.  I don't  want to  make too much of this, but we  are making aneffort to refine our ability to measure volatility  so  that we can provide the  Committee with a betterbasis for judging and deciding whether this  is something it should care  about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Peter, the numbers  look quite good in terms of confirmingyour hypothesis  about the rate  objectives  of the Bundesbank  and the Bank of Italy.  I had  alwaysthought that the  Bank of Italy, specifically the  Italian  government, would have been  far moreinterested in having  their rates converge  with the German rates  at the bottom of the  maturity curvebecause, as you know, their budget is  financed through short-term  instruments  and lower short-termrates  would do wonders  for their fiscal position.  Nonetheless,  I suspect that the implication  of theGerman  action, which is  essentially saying that they will not resist Italy's joining the EMU,  may bethe real driving force here.  Have  you spoken to anybody  at the Bank of Italy to get a sense  ofwhether in fact they were focusing  more on German  acquiescence  in Italy's  EMU entrance orwhether  they were in a  sense somewhat  disturbed  by the fact  that the Germans  seemed  to bepushing their rates up?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I have spoken  with people  at the Bank of Italy, the Bank of France,  andsome other European  central banks.  For the Italians,  there  is a hierarchy  of objectives.  Getting  intoEMU is the first, the  second, and  the third objective!  So, I think  they are prepared  to pay someprice  for EMU membership.  If they cannot  get their rates all the way down to  match German  rates,they are prepared  to go half-way.  Now, most people  in the market  anticipate another interest ratereduction from the Bank  of Italy  once the Italian budget passes.  I believe that  may occur in  comingweeks,  and there may be one or even two Bank of Italy actions before year-end  in light  of theBundesbank's  implicit announcement that short rates  ought to converge  somewhere  in the middle.9/30/97The Bundesbank's  comments  fell on very  fertile  ground in the  markets.  They  seemed to be  waitingto see when something might happen,  and they got a pre-blessing  out of Frankfurt.  It  seems clearthat people  in Europe wanted to see rates converge  on the low German  rates and  felt a certainreluctance  to suggest that  the convergence  be somewhere  in the middle of current rate  levels.  Onthe plus  side,  one reason the  German  action can be seen as positive is that it is creating  a greaterflexibility for the new ECB  when it comes  in.  People previously had been assuming  that the ECBwould simply pick up whatever  repo rate was set by the Bundesbank  and  that would be that.  Thishas  introduced  an element  of uncertainty.On the other hand, I think the French  are the  ones who will really feel they have beenmisled.  They went through the pain of getting  their rates  all the way  down and having themconverge  on the low German rates.  Now they hear that they will have to suffer the pain of goinghalf-way  up to meet Italian rate levels,  and they do not think that was the understanding.  That ispainful  for them.  There  are two  ways  to think about this  "meet-in-the-middle"  story.  One is interms  of mood music:  it sets a positive tone and gets  the process going.  But if it is taken literally, Ithink  it can  be quite  toxic.  You can fix exchange  rates  and let interest  rates  float or you can fixinterest rates  at the short end and let exchange rates float.  Trying to fix both in  advance  of theEMU event is a high-wire  act.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.  Any other questions for Peter?  If not, wouldsomeone  like to move to ratify the domestic  operations?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  We turn  now to Mike  Prell.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It would not surprise me ifmany of you found the  tale of the  staff forecast in  the Greenbook  moretortuous  than usual.  Preparing the forecast and  then writing it up proved tobe a considerable  struggle for us this time.9/30/97Perhaps  we engaged  in more  soul-searching  than was  really required,but we found ourselves  with what  seemed like  a complex  task.  We had tocontend  with the fact that  as we were  at work, financial markets  appeared tobe in  the grip  of new era fever and  stock prices  were  moving ever furtherabove,  and bond  yields ever further  below, where  we had  anticipated  theywould be.  We also had to explain why we were raising our forecast  of near-term growth  again,  as well as  why we thought moderation would  yet becoming.  And we had  to explain why,  though we were lowering  our inflationforecast  again, we  still expected  prices  to accelerate  in coming quarters.  Iwill try to run through some of the highlights  of our thinking as quickly aspossible  this morning.First, on the  new era, we  do not have  any problem  with the notion  thata good many things  have changed in  the world.  There  have  been  somegains.  The emergence  of new market economies  around the world hasunlocked  vast amounts  of underutilized labor resources.  There has been  alowering  of barriers  to international  trade  and capital flows.  There have beengains  in competition  and efficiency  through domestic deregulation  andrestructuring.  Also, today's labor market  is marked by less unionization  andby more flexible  approaches  to compensation.Of course,  one may observe  that these phenomena generally  involverather  gradual processes,  most of which  have been in train for some  time, butperhaps  there has been  some harmonic convergence that is yieldingmagnified  effects  recently.  In any event,  the practical question  is what tomake  of these  observations  when we attempt to  prepare a forecast that maybe helpful in framing monetary policy.  The new era advocates  say theeconomy can grow  faster, with lower unemployment,  without generatinginflation.  If they are simply talking  about higher trend productivity  growthor lower NAIRUs,  this doesn't suggest  the need for a new analyticalparadigm.  But they sometimes  seem to be  claiming that aggregate  supplyand demand  will  always be in non-inflationary  sync,  even if thegovernment's  statistics do not always  show it.  Monetary policy  seemingly isirrelevant in  this self-regulating  state of perfection.  You can dump  the staffand take  an indefinite vacation.  [Laughter]If I were not well shy of retirement  eligibility, I might be morereceptive  to this view.  But,  I suspect that most of you  share at least  some ofour skepticism.  Under the circumstances,  we feel  much more comfortabletaking the most relevant  and persuasive  aspects of the  new era view andincorporating  them in our model--one in which supply-demand  imbalancescan occur and give  rise to inflationary  pressures  that can  be modulated bymonetary  policy.  This is, in effect, what we have  been doing  all along.9/30/97So, with that prologue, what tendencies  do we think  are  facing you inthe  economy today?  As  you know,  we believe the economy  is still runningpretty hot.  Exports  have been zipping  along with remarkable  strength.  And,though last Thursday's  report on capital  goods orders was  a bit weaker thanwe  anticipated, it didn't undermine  our assessment  that this sector of theeconomy  is still  on a steep uptrend, paced by demand  for computers  andcommunications  equipment but with fairly  substantial demand  elsewhere,too.  The growth of these sectors and the massive  gains in stock marketwealth  are providing  consumers  with the wherewithal  to spend,  and they aredoing  so.  Indeed, judging by yesterday's monthly  PCE release,  they aredoing  so to an even greater degree  than we thought.  In light of those  figuresand the other late-arriving  data, we would now place  likely third-quarterGDP growth  in the 3 to 3-1/2  percent range.We  continue to think that  the levels  of some types  of household  andbusiness investment expenditures  are high enough that stocks  might soonbegin to get out  of kilter with  income and output trends if there is not somehas been large enough to damp  export growth and  raise import penetrationfurther in the  period ahead.  But, these  are far from a sure thing--certainly  interms of timing  and dimension.Booms  generate  a momentum of their own, and like others,  this one isbeing supported by a degree of financial  exuberance.  In fact,  it is  ourassessment that,  more  likely than not,  financial restraint sufficient  to rein inthe excess demand we  see will be  achieved  only with a decisive  enoughmonetary  policy jolt to shake the market's current  euphoria.  Whether thepercentage point hike in the  funds rate in the forecast is the right dose, weobviously  do not know  for sure, but if our analysis  is correct,  somethingnoticeable  probably will be required.The other part of the analysis  is,  of course,  our judgment that we  can'tdepend on productivity  increases  large  enough  to sustain  such rapid growthof output  and that the  Phillips curve is not dead.  It is  somewhat disfigured,perhaps, but not dead.  On the productivity  front,  as we  suggested in  theGreenbook,  there may well be room  for optimism regarding the outlook forgrowth in output per hour.  Among other things, despite  all the complaintsabout the quality  of available  workers, measured  productivity performancehas improved  of late.  We  are skeptical  of the new era view that firms  alwayshave another productivity  trick  up their sleeves  to  offset any cost increase--but it could be  that the  high-tech investments  are  now having  a moresignificant payoff, and we  have taken  a somewhat more optimistic  view  ofproductivity prospects.As  for the Phillips curve, we believe that compensation  practicesprobably  have  changed in ways  that may temper the short-run  response  of9/30/97overall pay structures  to tight labor markets.  On top of that consideration,  wealso have the  apparent divergence  of the degrees  of labor and factoryutilization.  This might  be viewed  as part  of the new era--the  perfectly elasticand immediate  supply  of plant  and equipment  as needed  to meet demand.Our projection of moderate capacity  utilization argues,  we think, for somerestraint  on inflation relative to  what might be implied by labor marketconditions.  Similarly, in the near term, the legacy  of recent low inflation  anda seeming  convergence  of expectations  on continued low inflation bodeswell  for the sustained moderation  of compensation  increases.How far to carry  these arguments  in recalibrating  one's model  of theinflation  process  is a difficult judgment  call.  We do  not think they  eliminateentirely  the risk of an upturn of inflation if labor markets  remain as taut  asthey are now,  let alone get tighter, as  we are projecting.  Moreover, there area couple of other special  factors that reinforce  the likelihood  of a steeper risein prices  going forward.One of them is the possibility that employers will  face  significantincreases  in premiums  for health  insurance.  In  this regard,  I might note  that,at the end of last week,  it was announced  that the premiums  in the FederalEmployees  Health Benefit program will be  rising an average  of 8-1/2  percentnext year.  We  have not  had the  opportunity to research  this  developmentadequately,  so I am not  sure that this is a clear sign  that the  pressures  in thissphere will be greater  than we anticipated  in  our forecast.  It is a  worry,however.Finally, in looking  at the  inflation outlook, we think it is important  toconsider the prospects  for the dollar.  Estimates of the effects  of the dollarappreciation  and the associated decline in  import prices  vary considerably,but they certainly have been  a significant  factor  tending to trim domesticinflation  in the past year or two.  An  advocate  of the new era might say that astrong dollar is just a  natural and lasting result  of the reaccommodation  ofthe  United States  in the world economy, but  with the probability of agrowing  external deficit,  we find it hard to swallow  the concept that weshould be anticipating  another  20 percent  rise  in the dollar over the next twoyears.  It could happen, but we  are betting against  it.  Without  that influence--indeed,  with the possibility  of some reversal  of the dollar--containinginflation  is going to be more difficult.Toting up all  these considerations, we have core  inflation  acceleratingonly  a couple of tenths  per year through  1999  despite continuous  sub-five-percent  unemployment.  That rate  is, to be  sure, damped  a couple  of tenthsby technical  changes  to the CPI.  But, especially  given the  expectedabatement  of favorable  exchange  rate  effects,  the forecast  does  fallsomewhat short  of what might normally have been anticipated  simply on thebasis of the excess  demand for labor--say,  if one simply  applied a9/30/97conventional  "sacrifice  ratio"  to the  unemployment  gap relative to a 5-1/2percent  NAIRU.We think that we have been judicious  in adapting to the incomingevidence  and in taking  account of alternative  explanations  for the  surpriseswe  have experienced.  In the end, despite our flirtation  with the new eraview,  our forecast conveys  a rather clear message  that the risks are tiltedtoward higher inflation in the absence  of some restrictive  policy action.  But,I would  have to say that this is truly a period in which  the outlook ischaracterized by the proverbial  "unusual degree"  of uncertainty.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions for Mike?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I think Mike's  oral presentation  adds a good dealof clarity to the ideas  behind the  Greenbook forecast.  There  are a couple  of things there, however,that strike me as somewhat  inconsistent,  and perhaps  you could  clarify this  for me or the rest of us.We  have a rather high real  interest rate  now and  that rate makes carrying  inventory expensive.  Thisfunds rate by  100 basis points as assumed  in the Greenbook forecast,  we would have a real  interestrate  of about 4 percent and that would make carrying  inventories hugely  expensive.  I would likeyour view of the likelihood that  such an increase in the real rate  would bring  about  a much greaterinventory correction  than you have  in the  forecast.The other thing that strikes me  as somewhat  inconsistent is the relationship in theforecast  between the 20 percent correction  in  the  stock market  and the behavior of long-terminterest rates.  I think that if you  assume any kind of wealth effect coming  from an "I-am-scared-to-death" 20 percent correction in stock prices, especially  if the latter were  to occur relatively quickly,the flow  of funds would be from the  stock market  into the bond market and instead of the long-terminterest rates  going up  as in the forecast, I think one might expect  them to come down.  Those  arethe two things in the forecast that  appear to me to be somewhat  inconsistent.9/30/97

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Those  are very interesting  questions.  Perhaps the relatively  high real rateof interest  in recent years, particularly  if it is measured  in terms of the prices  of goods,  say the PPI,of course, is the better information  systems  that firms have  to work with.  Going forward, we doproject  a substantial  deceleration  of inventory investment from what we have been  seeing recently.The level of the inventory-sales  ratio remains historically  low in our forecast.  I think firms will stillfind that markets  are  not so loose, even  given our capacity utilization numbers,  that they feel  theycan avoid the need to have  some precautionary  stocks on hand.  But, yes, there is always thepotential,  especially when we are anticipating that  final demand will be decelerating  and perhapssurprisingly  so over the coming year, that inventories  will get out of line at least temporarily.  Thatwould lead initially to a period of somewhat  greater  inventory accumulation  than we have  in theforecast but that would be followed by a swing down toward  a much lower rate  of accumulation,and it would introduce  a bit of a cycle into the outlook.  Whether  inventories  in our forecast  are toohigh on an  average basis given  these real interest rates  is an  interesting question.  I don't think Ihave  much more that I can  add on this question.  It is certainly  something that we are  aware of.On the  stock market correction  question,  there is  something of a chicken  and eggproblem.  The same sort of thought has  occurred to me; we may have some  shifting of the riskpremia  in the  market.  But there  is a consistency in the forecast, at least in the sense that one reasonwhy we anticipate  the stock market decline  is  the rise in interest rates.  That rise will require  ahigher discount rate in the stock market  valuation formula.  If we did not get that interest rateadjustment at least initially, we wonder whether the negative  earning  surprises  would be enough tocreate  this kind of decline in stock prices.  So, it may be a timing issue; we  may see some swingsinvolving  a flight to security  and to  fixed-income instruments.  It is not inconceivable  that the9/30/97enthusiasm  about prospective  stock market returns  has been  a factor that in essence  has raisedyields across the board on various  types of financial instruments.  Why would I invest  in a bondthat yielded  only 4 percent when  I think I can get  a much higher return in  the stock market?  If theexpected returns in the stock  market go down,  perhaps  we will also have  some effect on the bondthe stock market  so that people will require  a higher expected return relative to those on bonds.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I think you  answered my question in part, Mike.  It also relates  to theGreenbook  assumptions  of a one hundred basis point tightening in  1998 and a 20 percent stockcorrection in the  "no change"  scenario.  More  generally,  is the stock  market correction  independentof the course of monetary policy?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The "no  change"  scenario  that we have included in that model  simulationclearly would imply a higher level of stock prices  than in our baseline  forecast.  That better stockworks  through the discount  factor in stock price  valuations.  So, the wealth effects are morefavorable to consumer demand  in the alternative  stable interest rate  scenario.  Our feeling is thatthere is certainly  the potential,  simply on the basis of disappointment  in earnings  growth,  for stockprices to fall off some.  We see the tightening  of policy, and the shift in expectations  that  thatcauses--and  the related tendency for bond yields to back up--as  an important  factor  in explainingthe timing and  dimension of the  stock market decline  we have in the forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.9/30/97

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  the ECI forecast in the Greenbook  has an increase  of just a coupleof tenths  over the forecast period.  There is reference  in  the Greenbook  to  the fact that theincreasing role  of bonuses  and  other incentive payments  may be having some influence  inmoderating  measured increases  in  employment  costs.  You mentioned in your oral presentation  thatmedical  premiums  may be rising significantly.  We, too, hear a lot about the possibility thatmedical premiums  will be going up considerably  in  1998.  It seems to  me that in  your ECI forecastthere is almost an  implicit flat-to-down path  for wage  and  salary increases.  Do you think the risksare fairly  symmetrical in  that forecast?  Are there factors  that I am not taking into account  thatcould moderate  the increase  in medical  premiums?  The latter seems likely to be very  large.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Let me mention  a couple of things:  One, we did build in  only mildaccelerations in wages and  salaries and in total benefits,  and we incorporated  a rather modestupturn in the  cost of medical  benefits relative to  some of the stories we  have heard.  To someextent, we have  to consider whether we  are looking at the gross increase  in the cost of the medicalbenefits or whether they are  the net cost the employer is  going to incur.  Certainly,  many largercompanies  in the last year or two have been talking about  how their philosophy  has shifted  toviewing  the health insurance  benefit as a defined contribution  arrangement  rather than as a  definedbenefit.  So, they  are looking  for ways  to pass along the rising cost to the employees by restrictingbenefits  or increasing  the out-of-pocket  expenses  that the employees  will experience.  In light of theseeming  confirmation  of some of the scarier stories and the recent federal  employee health benefitsannouncement, our faith  is a little shaken that we have  allowed  for enough  of an increase.  I wouldsay that we  do not see compelling evidence  that one should write  the step-up off as something thatwill be offset through lower  wage increases.  The evidence  that that will be the pattern in the  short9/30/97run  is rather shaky.  In this tight labor  market, I think there  is a clear risk of more overallcompensation  inflation than  we  are projecting.The final point I would  make is that, in  this forecast,  as  measured  in product prices--andwe  think this highly  relevant--the  increases  in compensation  are sizable  in real  terms and they aregrowing  faster than trend  productivity.  So, in this  model, workers  are  doing reasonably  wellbecause  of the benefits  of low price  inflation.  Now, whether  this is the dynamic that will prevail  inthis kind of environment  is a matter of conjecture.  We have  been struck  to date by how,  in the faceof lots of stories  about tight labor markets and employers  undertaking to pay particular  workersmore  in one  way or another,  we really have not seen  an acceleration  in labor costs.  It may be justaround  the corner,  and we may have  to reverse course  in the  sequence  of revisions  we have beenmaking  in the forecast.

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank  you.  I always pay special attention  to September Greenbooksbecause  they give us that extra year in the forecast  horizon  to think  about.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I might just remark  that  since this  is the first time we  have formally done  aforecast  for 1999,  it probably  is a little shakier than  it might otherwise be.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  But  September forecasts  are nonetheless  useful.  A year ago inaround  4-1/2 percent and not much progress was being made in the direction  of reduced  growth.This forecast  pulls down nominal  spending growth by  a full percentage  point by the end of 1998compared  to the previous  forecast, but it also runs  growth  out in  1999  at a rate  of around 3-1/2percent.  I find that  interesting, but  I need to know how it is coming  about.  As I understand  it,9/30/97Mike,  your baseline assumption  is that starting perhaps 6  months or so from now the Committeewill raise  the federal  funds rate by 100 basis points  over the course of next year, presumably  in  1/4percentage  point steps.  That is more  of a  total increase  than you were previously  assuming.  Iwould imagine  that, as  a general principle,  the longer we delay taking any kind of policy action, themore policy  action you  assume  we will  have to have  to get the same result.  In comparison withyour  assumption of starting to raise the funds rate in  6 months to produce  the Greenbook forecastresult, assuming we like that result, what kind of tradeoff in timing versus  amount would you havein  mind if we started to tighten  policy now?  How much less  of an increase in the funds rate mightwe need  in total to produce the  same  Greenbook forecast through  1999?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I do not have  a model simulation  in my pocket to give you a quantitativeanswer to that.  I think that a  series of policy  moves that raised the federal  funds rate  100 basispoints by next March instead  of one that only started  to raise  the funds rate next March  wouldprobably lead to circumstances  that would encourage  the Committee to think  about reversingcourse by  1999.  The reason would be  to make sure that, as we  moved out of 1999  and  into 2000,monetary  policy was not holding down  the level  of output  so much that more slack ultimatelywould be  created than  was needed to achieve  a gradual  moderation in  the expansion  and a return toa flat-to-descending  inflation path.  Another way of approaching  this policy adjustment would be tostart the process earlier and move more  gradually to get to the  same point.  You basically aretalking about  shifting the process  forward with about as sharp a total increase in the funds rate, andI think that approach would create  a greater likelihood  that you would have the opportunity toreverse  course, say, in  1999.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  So your  view is not that we do less  in total, but that we would start toreverse it sooner?9/30/97

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  As  a first approximation,  I would  conceive of that  as a more likelyalternative  in terms of nipping in the bud what  we think is an  incipient pickup in inflation.  But werecognize,  harking back to President McDonough's  remark, that the implied real interest rate  at theshort end would be fairly high with a nominal  federal funds rate  of 6-1/2 percent.  At that level,some easing in policy  might be warranted  if and  as the inflation  rate was checked  and theperception was that  the rate  of inflation  was clearly headed back down into the sub-3-percentinflation zone.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank you, Jerry just asked the question I wanted to pose.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Mike,  the data of the last couple of months clearly havebeen far stronger, especially  in the manufacturing  area, yet commodity prices have eased.  Are webeing put in a position where, for forecast  and model purposes,  we are using wages and prices  asexogenous variables?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I'm not sure I understand  that thought.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me take  a step back.  If you were to take the type ofmacro  environment we are looking at and you were trying to make up  for a shortfall  from yourearlier expectations,  the numbers  in such a forecast would, I  suspect, be far stronger than the onesthat you have.  So,  in that regard the add  factors  are very  dominant elements  in the forecast.  Thequestion  that I am asking  is whether these factors  have  become  so large in recent forecasts  that theyare  in effect giving us an  exogenous forecast  of prices.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I'm not sure  I conceive  of it as exogenous.  In a sense we are lettingbygones be bygones and not  anticipating that the favorable  inflation surprises  have created  somepent-up inflationary  pressure  that is going to burst forth  in the future.  I am impressed by recent9/30/97commodity market developments.  I looked at the charts  the other day.  I did see some indicationsin copper  markets of changing expectations  that  appeared to be  associated  with the problems inSoutheast Asia, and there  may be  some special  stories elsewhere.  However, when we  look acrossthe breadth of the commodity  markets, there  really is no  sign of general  pressure  in those markets.If we look at these markets narrowly  in terms of the domestic  industrial picture, capacity  utilizationrates are  not extraordinarily  high in most sectors.  And where  utilization is  fairly high, as it is forexample in  the steel  industry, the businesses  in question  are drawing  in a  large volume  of importsand they have  capacity  coming on stream  prospectively in such a way that there really  does notseem to be much pricing leverage.  So, in the last few months we increasingly have  given weight tothe sense that there  really is not much pressure  in the goods  sector and that there is  a lot of capacitycoming on line in the United States  and in many instances  abroad.  In our view, worldwideeconomic activity  is not going  to be so robust relative to capacity that we are  going to have  a lot ofpressures in the commodity  markets.  I do not see those  markets  as the  source of more  inflationindependently  of what is going on more broadly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If you are  making the assumption that your model'shistorical  structure and its coefficients  are essentially correct  and you  are letting bygones  bebygones, you will get a specific  numerical  forecast  which follows from those two assumptions.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We are in  a sense  modifying  some of the conditions in that model.  Whenwe look at cycles historically, we see that capacity  utilization has tended to move up asunemployment  has moved down.  It is very hard to discern  econometrically  a separate  role forindustrial capacity  utilization as a measure  of the underlying  inflationary pressure.  In the currentcircumstance,  the  deviation of the  capacity utilization rate from what we would predict given theunemployment  rate  is becoming  substantial.9/30/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I gather  that is  true with the manufacturing  unemploymentrate  as well?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Probably.  Those industry  unemployment  rates are a shaky proposition.  Imust say I have not really looked  at that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  CHAIRMAN.  The last time we  looked at this issue was  a year or so ago,and  we saw the same problem for the total unemployment  rate.  It was not a sectoral  phenomenon;it was a divergence between  the labor market  and the facilities  market.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Since manufacturers  cannot produce without workers,  the labor  market isstill relevant  here.  We do  hear, and there were  some Beigebook  comments, that at least in someinstances manufacturers  were  finding that they had to raise their wages  in order to attract and retainthe workers  they needed.  But the  system seems  to be working  in such  a way that we think itbehooves  us to give some weight to our expectation  that capacity utilization is going to remainrelatively  moderate.  We think this will put some  damper on  what the pickup in inflation  otherwisewould be  going forward.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  As Jack mentioned, most of the good questions  already have beenasked.  Mike, I know we have had an  asymmetric  risk picture in most of the recent  Greenbookforecasts and certainly  in the way  the Committee  has approached  setting its directives.  Would yousay that the risks incorporated in this forecast  are larger than they have been in earlier ones  in termsof the degree of "judiciousness" that has been used in interpreting  some of the evidence?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  One  of the risks we repeatedly have pointed to and then last time said itmight not be such an  asymmetric risk was the role of the stock market and the  implications forconsumption.  As you  may recall, the revised national income accounts  that we received  after the9/30/97working  the way one would have expected.  We thought that  somehow the  world now was rightand that we had  a grasp of its functioning.  We  were not quite  so concerned  as we had been  aboutthe risk that we would  suddenly  find consumption  surging  in a belated response to theaccumulation  of wealth.  In the interim, the stock market has  once  again risen more  than weexpected.  The difference  is not big, but it is there,  and consumption  expenditures are  surpassingeven  our expectation of a robust upturn in  the third quarter.  Going forward,  I do not have the sensethat our forecast  implies an  asymmetry of risks in  terms of aggregate  demand being stronger  orweaker.  But it makes me nervous  that we keep  making revisions  in the  same direction,  and mysense is that there  really is  a boom mentality  at work in  the economy today.  The financial marketsare supplying  ample credit  to borrowers,  and  the ongoing appreciation  of share prices,  now moreconcentrated  in the smaller cap issues, is providing  cheap equity capital for many companies.  Iworry that these booming conditions may be  even more strongly maintained  than we have forecast.But in terms of the nuts and bolts of putting this forecast  together and the  assumptions  we havemade for deviations  from what  we think of as  normal behavior over time, I don't think we have  anobvious  tilt in the risks.Let me add something that Don Kohn just whispered  in my ear.  We have helped,  I think,to balance these risks in  a sense by changing the policy assumptions.  As we talk about  the changesin the forecast, you should not overlook that we have  incorporated  in it a more  stringent  set  ofpolicy  actions.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  In your alternate forecast  scenario  that involves  no further change inthe federal  funds rate,  I wonder about that 2.6 percent GDP growth figure  for  1998 which  occurswithout the  100 basis point tightening.  I think there is a lot of optimism in that forecast  that  growth9/30/97will slow  on its  own.  Now,  granted that this  is not your  forecast number,  but in terms of trying tobalance  off your actual forecast  against  a picture  of what would happen  if we did nothing, I thinkyou have  a  lot of windage  in that "no change"  scenario.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Obviously  the latest data, particularly including  the latest inflationreport, are  very favorable.  Maybe  it is time for me to stop worrying  and join the celebration.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Don't you dare do that!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  You need not worry.  I'm still nervous,  and I get the sense from thequestions  and  comments this morning that the staff and  other people are  as well.  I am still nervouspartly because  of what I hear in my District and because I have  a sense  that the foundation  of all thegood news lately may be fragile.As  far as  our District is concerned, it seems  quite clear to me that regional  economicactivity  has strengthened  appreciably  over the period  since our last meeting.  Labor markets, whichwere already  tight, strike me as  even tighter now than they were.  I have heard  some comments9/30/97recently  suggesting that labor markets  in much of our District  are as tight as  at any time since Ihave been in  the Federal  Reserve.  There  is increasing  concern  about  this among employers.  Wehear this in a lot of comments,  but I heard  it especially  loudly in  the comments  of the members ofour Small Business and Agriculture  Advisory  Council  when they met a  week  ago.  They spokeabout  signing bonuses  for middle level  and even clerical  entry-level  workers.  The owner of aconstruction  company talked  about  skyrocketing wages  in his sector.  The owner of a privateemployment  agency said that salaries for mid-level people have  risen  sharply over the last threemonths.  One of the members of the  group said  that the remaining labor pool in her regionconsisted mostly of essentially unemployable people,  and there were reports  of constructionprojects being  stretched out for lack of even  minimally qualified  workers.  So, our regional  laborestate sector.  These reports  are not universal  across the District, but we hear that especially  in thesouthern  part of the District there is overbuilding  of hotels  and office and commercial  space for thefirst time in some  time.Again,  there  currently seems to be  a lot of steam in our District economy,  but having saidall of this,  let me acknowledge  that we still are not hearing reports of significant price increases  infinal goods  and  services.  That condition,  of course, is encouraging,  but I wonder how long it canlast given the apparent robustness  of business conditions  in our region.At the national  level, I think we already recognize  that the Greenbook's  baselineprojections are  quite optimistic.  They call  for continuing  growth at a robust pace,  a drop in theunemployment  rate to 4-1/2 percent,  and an acceleration  in  core CPI inflation of only .2 percentnext year despite the absence  of any firming action on  our part until  1998.  That is a rosy scenario,9/30/97but it is not an  unreasonable  one given what has been happening  over the last year  and half or so,and  it certainly  could come  to pass.I think, however, that  there are very substantial  risks to this projection.  Some of themalready have been mentioned today.  I will focus on  a couple that  arise primarily from theGreenbook  assumption that we may wait until as late as next spring before tapping  on the brakes.First, the Greenbook  is projecting that our assumed tightening  in  1998  will contribute  to a 20percent  decline in the stock market over the  course of the  year.  Of course, we really do not knowwhere the market is going to be 6 months down  the road, especially  if we keep policy on hold untilthen, or how strong the market reaction  to our initial  action may be, again especially  if we waituntil as late as next spring before taking that action.  I think there's a significant  risk that thereaction  could be  very negative.  What worries me  about that possibility  is that concern  about itmight incline  us to wait longer before tightening further, and that could put us significantly  behindthe  curve.  I would argue that something like that happened after the market break in  1987.  If thisdoes  happen, we will have  to play catch-up  the  way we did back in  1988  and  1989.  Obviously, thatwould increase  the risk of a recession.  I recognize  that is a speculative  comment,  but I do not thinkit is far-fetched.The second risk, perhaps in some  ways the greater one,  is that by waiting until late nextspring to tap the brakes, we risk being challenged  by some sort of inflation scare.  It could  arisefrom one of the incoming  economic reports.  Capacity  utilization, domestically  at least, is nowapproaching the level that has been  associated  with rising inflation  pressures  in the past.  So, thegood fortune  and good luck we have had with the  monthly core inflation reports may run out atsome point.  In that kind of situation,  I worry that public  confidence  in our ability to keep a lid oninflation could  diminish quite rapidly if we are  seen as reacting to developments  rather than9/30/97conditioning  them.  Some of you may have  seen a TV  commercial  that advertises  an upscale car bysaying that life is  divided between  drivers  and passengers,  suggesting that drivers  are more  contentthan passengers  because they are  in control.  I'm not sure that  is always  true on the highway;  Iknow it is not true on 1-95  where I would rather let somebody else drive.  But I think it is applicableto monetary policy.  I hope we will keep  our hands firmly on  the wheel  and be ready to tap thebrakes sooner than in the  Greenbook  scenario if we need to, as I think we may well have to.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  economic  growth  has continued  to display strength  in theTwelfth District  in recent months.  Payroll employment grew by almost 3  percent at an annual  ratethis summer.  The number of jobs expanded briskly  in the construction,  real  estate, and  localgovernment sectors  in the District  states that  have fast-growing populations.  Total manufacturingpayrolls  were boosted by the pickup in Washington  State where we see a lot of growth  in aerospaceemployment.  This, of course,  is the effect  of Boeing's increased  production  as well as the effect ofthat production  on  supplying industries.  However,  aside from the aerospace industry,  growth inDistrict manufacturing  employment has slowed a bit recently.  Job  gains have  been most rapid inWashington  and Nevada  where payrolls are  expanding at about a 6 percent annual  rate.  Forexample, the  competition for  skilled workers  has stiffened in the  Seattle area where Boeing,Microsoft, and other high-tech employers  are expanding rapidly.  In the Las  Vegas  area,construction of resort and other commercial  projects  continues to boom.  The pace of expansion  inCalifornia has remained  strong in recent  months, but it no longer appears  to be  accelerating.Payroll  employment  growth  slowed to about a 2 percent average  annual pace this summer, and thatis down  from a 3  percent gain in the preceding  12  months.9/30/97The national  economy has continued to yield good  news,  as we have  all seen.  Economicactivity appears  to have  turned in another  strong performance  in the  third quarter and inflation hasfallen  further.  Looking forward,  I think there are  a number of reasons to expect  aggregate  demandto slow in the quarters  ahead.  Inventories  appear to be  a bit on the  high side as do stocks  of mostother types of real assets  held by businesses and households.  At its present level,  the dollar is arestraining influence,  and  fiscal policy certainly remains  somewhat restrictive.  As  a result, weexpect  to see a slowdown  in nominal  GDP growth from 5-1/4 percent  this year to about 4 percent in1998, with real GDP expanding  by about 2 percent next year.  However, I think there is upside riskto the outcome for next year,  given  that the economy has  surprised us on the strong side over thepast year or so and the possibility that a  significant positive supply shock is affecting  the economy.With regard to inflation, the roughly  2 percent increase  in the GDP price  index that Iexpect for  1998 represents  a relatively small rise  over the 1-3/4 percent increase  anticipated for thisyear.  Of course,  conventional  measures  of resource  utilization  suggest upward pressure  oninflation.  It is difficult, however, to know how much  weight to put on these  indicators.  While thereare reasons to be concerned  about  their reliability at present, it is too  soon to tell if their historicalrelationships  with inflation  have broken down.  Our analysis  suggests  that inflation  forecasts  in thepast two years  based upon  these relationships  are within normal statistical bounds.  Even if we doget some upward pressure  on inflation  from high resource  utilization,  there  are other factors in ourforecast for  1998 that tend to restrain inflation  at least temporarily.  These  include negative  speedeffects from the slowing growth  of the economy and the high level of the dollar.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic  conditions in the SeventhDistrict are quite  similar to those on which I reported  at our August meeting.  Our regional9/30/97economy continues  to expand at a moderate rate  that is slower  than the nation's, in  part due to  laborsupply constraints.I met with our Advisory  Councils  on Agriculture,  Labor, and  Small Business a couple ofweeks  ago.  The primary focus of discussion  in all three  groups was labor market conditions.Indeed,  for small  businesses, labor has become  the limiting factor rather  than capital, which  seemsto be quite plentiful  at least  according  to these  people.  The general  sense was  that labor marketshad tightened  further since these  advisory councils  previously met last  spring, and that is consistentwith the fact that our region's unemployment  rate  fell below 4 percent and stayed below 4 percentduring this period.  These tighter conditions  seem to be leading to some increases  in the growth ofbase pay.  But with a few exceptions,  the increases  are quite modest  and on the order of .2 to .3percent  higher than a year ago.  More  striking are the other measures  that firms are  taking to securequalified  labor.  These include  signing bonuses  for new employees  and  staying bonuses for existingones.  These  forms of compensation  do not show up in the ECI, and they appear to be ever morecommon.  Small businesses  are offering  more flexible hours, customized benefits,  and perks  liketickets  to sporting events.  At the same time, the trend toward  greater  use of variable pay  seems tohave accelerated.  Even  some UAW assembly workers now have their pay tied to productivitytargets.  Firms seem  increasingly willing to move jobs  to areas where  labor is not as  scarce.  Themost extreme  example mentioned  at this meeting involved  telemarketing firms,  which seem to beable to locate in  areas with relatively  high unemployment.  A new facility in such an area can  beginits operations within  a month.  Tight labor markets  also are  encouraging,  and in some cases  forcing,firms to spend more on worker training.  Similarly, apprenticeship programs  are  being revitalized  inthe building trades  and elsewhere.  Finally, council  members reported that conditions remainfavorable  for moving people from  welfare to work.  Even here, the constraint  appears  to be mainly9/30/97on the side of the labor supply.  The individuals who have difficulty  moving from welfare to  theworkforce  often cannot pass  a drug test or  are not familiar with the mores of the workplace.As  I reported before,  District manufacturers  and retailers continue to tell us thatcompetitive pressures  inhibit their ability to raise  prices,  although there have  been some exceptions.For example,  at our last meeting  I reported  on a large paper company that had pushed through itsfirst price increase  since  1995.  That increase  has held for the entire industry,  and the  firm isplanning  other price  increases  this fall.  Prices  of heavy and  corrugated paper  are up, and there  istalk that newsprint  will soon be on  allocation.  Overall, manufacturing  activity  continues to increasein the District,  although  at a slower pace than in the nation.  Results from the Chicago  PurchasingManagers'  Survey were released this morning, and  the composite  index moved lower, to 61.2 inslowly than in August.  The prices-paid  component was 59 and the supplier-deliveries  componentcame in at 58.1,  both above 50 but below their August readings.  At our August meeting, Imentioned that there  were some  hints of slowing  in the steel  distribution  and  trucking industries,which contacts thought might be temporary.  That seems  to have  been the case  as these contactsnow report that activity  has returned to high levels.In terms of consumer  spending trends, reports  generally  point to continued  strength infor most Michigan  retailers.  Across  the District as well as nationally,  discounters  are nowexperiencing  strong sales performances,  while the high-end  or luxury segment  is noticeablysluggish.  This represents  a reversal  from the pattern that we saw earlier this year.  At one largenational retailer headquartered  in the District, sales  of appliances and  home electronics  haveincreased  considerably  in recent weeks  while sales of apparel  have  moderated.  Auto and  light truck9/30/97sales have been boosted  by targeted  incentives  and the unbundling  of option items.  Septembersales will not be quite  as  strong  as the  15-1/2 million  unit pace  of July and  August, but even  withthe  shortened reporting period, our automobile  industry contacts  believe  September sales  will behigher than the level implied  in the Greenbook.Turning to the national  outlook,  I was slightly optimistic at our August  meeting that thefundamentals  were in  place for future real  growth at trend rates,  but the  new paradigm dilemma  isnow  about as large  as it gets.  Second-quarter  real GDP  growth is substantially higher, while theinflation  data continue to roll in  lower than expected.  The burst of investment in potentiallyproductivity-enhancing  capital equipment  is encouraging.  Nevertheless,  although my inflationoutlook has moved lower since the August  meeting,  it still has a somewhat  steeper upward tilt thanthe Greenbook.  On balance, I continue  to view the risk to the outlook as  being on the upside.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Mr. Chairman,  may I interrupt  for a moment?  I would like  to remind themembers  that in this discussion of what  happens if the Committee  tightens  sooner than is assumedin the Greenbook forecast,  the tighter alternative  in the Greenbook is  a first approximation.  It  is thesort of scenario  where the  Committee starts the tightening process immediately,  and by the middleof next year the funds rate is  at 7 percent instead  of 6-1/2 percent.  But as you can see if you look atthe numbers  for  1999, we have  slow growth in economic activity and the  unemployment  rate ismoving  up very rapidly.  So, this goes to the remark that I made earlier.  If you looked out to 2000,you would probably be thinking  about moderating the amount of restraint that was being imposedso that you did not needlessly  overshoot the  sustainable unemployment levels.  I think you can getsome sense from the Greenbook  as to what the difference  might be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  What worries me is that we may well need an  actual turnin the inflation  rate to get a sense of what this process is  all about because  we are  still guessing.  If9/30/97we  go back six months,  even though we were then seeing  falling inflation, the presumption  that itwould continue to fall over the ensuing  six months would probably have been considered  almostinconceivable.  Until we  get  a sense that this unusual  behavior  is coming to an  end, I don't think  weare going to understand fully what is happening.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't question that.  I just felt that I probably overlooked  a piece  ofinformation  that might have been a more direct  answer to your question.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The Eleventh District  economy continues to do very well, which Iregard  as a  good thing.  The Dallas District was cited in the Beigebook summary  as havingincreased  retail  sales and  some modest upward pressure on  prices and wages  in the services  andretail  sectors.  Manufacturing  activity has picked up in our District  since the  last meeting.  Oilrefineries  are operating  at record capacity  levels.  Rig counts are  at their highest level  since  1991,and even so their number is being constrained by a shortage  of crews.  Existing home sales haveincreased  modestly, while commercial  and office vacancy  rates have continued to decline,  leadingto rising commercial  construction  in our area and  a shortage  of construction  workers.  Moderategains in bank lending  and continued  competition between  bank and nonbank lenders  have beenputting some downward  pressure on rates but mostly  on terms.  As for shortages  and bottlenecks,there have been  some rail  shipment disruptions related  to railroad  mergers, and anecdotal reportsfrom our Small Business  Advisory Committee  suggest that, at least in our part of the country,  UPSoperations have  not yet recovered fully from the  strike.  There is still a good bit of confusion there.Most farm crops in our area are in better shape  than they have  been in quite a while, but ourfarmers are  almost obsessed with El Nino.  They do not know what its impact is going to be on9/30/97them.  An  economist at Exxon, who is also a meteorologist,  has  asked us if we could  get  acombination  economic/weather  forecast  for them.  Perhaps  we will be looking into that!Texas traditionally  has faster employment  growth than  the nation as a whole but at thesame time a somewhat higher unemployment  rate.  That is the result of two factors, net  strong in-migration  of workers  into Texas and  the poverty and high levels of unemployment  in the southerntier of Texas counties  along  the Mexican  border.  That area is now benefiting  from the recent strongrecovery  of the Mexican  economy, which is export-led  and concentrated  in northern Mexicoespecially  among the maquiladora plants  on the Mexican  side  of the Tex-Mex  border.  That isbeginning to improve business  noticeably in South Texas.  I might just mention  that the pesodevaluation  gave  a boost to  the already  strong and rapidly growing  maquiladora  industry.  It is myunderstanding  that U.S. manufacturing  employment  has increased  by only about 33,000 workerssince  the end of 1994  while manufacturing  employment in the maquiladoras  has  increased  300,000,about ten  times as much.  Only seven U.S.  states, if they are ranked  in terms of manufacturingemployment, rank higher than the maquiladora industry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I did not quite  get the difference  between the  33,000 and300,000.  What is the 33,000  again?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The 33,000 is the increase in U.S. manufacturing  employment  since theend of 1994.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  In Texas?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  No, I think it is for the nation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  And the 300,000 is  the increase in maquiladora  manufacturingemployment  over the same period.  If we rank the states in terms of manufacturing  employment,9/30/97California is first, Ohio is next, then Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania  and New York.  Themaquiladoras  would rank  eighth, coming in ahead of North  Carolina and Florida, for example,which I find to be something of a surprise.  They are  supplementing  the U.S.  manufacturingcapacity, and  I think a lot of that supplemented  capacity  is in the industrial Midwest.  The pointthere is that the maquiladora  manufacturing  capacity is  helping to alleviate  the pressure  on  U.S.capacity  utilization.I might also mention  with respect to Mexico that  since the last FOMC  meeting. HarveyRosenblum and I spent a  day with the  Board of Governors  of the Bank of Mexico and we  also metwith the Minister of Finance.  Some of my impressions  are as follows:  The  smoothness of theMexican election  should not encourage  us too much.  There is a mood of "get  even"  and "payback"  that threatens  to take economic  policymaking  out of the control  of the  technocrats in Mexico.The parties  of the left and the right  seem more willing to get together to oppose the center than toget with the center to oppose the other extreme.  So far, the economic  argument is focused  onwhether and how much to roll back the value-added  tax that was increased  during the peso  crisis.While the macro numbers  describing the Mexican  economic  recovery  are  strong--their  real GDPincreased almost  9 percent over the past year--it is concentrated in the export sector, which is alsoconcentrated geographically  in the northern part of Mexico.  This recovery is  missing a lot of thepeople  who were  harmed by the initial downturn and by the  devaluation.  The point is that the vastmajority of the  people have not felt much of the benefit of the  rebound,  and this is limiting thepolitical  credit  that might have been  given for the good macroeconomic  performance.  While theMexicans  have  stopped the  hemorrhaging  of their banking system, the latter's  return to health  hasbarely  begun and it remains vulnerable.  In addition, the cost of the government's rescue efforts  is adouble-digit  percentage  of GDP, another  factor contributing  to the lowering of standards  of living.9/30/97The Mexican  authorities  understand the dilemmas  and the dangers  of having their exchange  rateheld up in real terms  by capital  inflows, but their  desire to maintain an open economy leaves  themwith not much they can do about it, and they may be  a little nervous  about  being in somewhat thesame position  now as  they were in  1994.  From our side of the border, their strong  peso is boostingour exports.  A favorite  way of measuring exports  to Mexico is to measure the length of the line oftrucks  in Laredo  going toward Monterey  on 1-35,  and it is typically backed  up 5  to  7 miles  thesedays.Turning to the U.S. economy,  what can I  say except  "the  beat goes on."  It is good to seethe near-term Greenbook  forecast  taking on more of an  optimistic, new paradigm tone.  I did notethat the Greenbook  soul searching over the new  era rhetoric  was,  in Mike Prell's words,  "tortuous,"but it was appreciated  nevertheless.  As  for Greenbook  details, the only thing I would quibble witha little is that we see the real third-quarter  growth rate  to be considerably  stronger  than theGreenbook has it now.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, the New England economy  continues  to grow  steadilyat roughly  the national  rate.  The regional  unemployment  rate in August was  about 4.3 percent,  andinitial unemployment  claims continue  to trend down.  Labor force  participation rates  are rising inresponse to the attractive  employment situation.  Most of our job growth has been concentrated  inservices,  as is true  for the national  economy, but no sector  of the regional  economy is doing poorlyat present.  Even  manufacturing  employment has  begun to edge  up.  This represents  a ratherstriking contrast.  We are always  looking at how things got out of whack  in New England at the endof the  1980s  and how things are different  now, and hopefully they are.  At the end of the  1980s,New  England was enjoying  a very high degree of prosperity.  Then, as now, most of the new jobs9/30/97were  in services, but that situation masked employment  declines  in many of the region'smanufacturing  industries,  and that, of course,  played into the depth  of the recession  when thebubble  finally burst in New England.Our informal  conversations  with the region's retailers  and manufacturers  confirm thepositive  picture.  Retail  sales  and manufacturing revenues  are up from year-ago  levels, surpassingexpectations  in  many cases.  Manufacturing  strength is  quite broad-based,  with aircraft parts andfurniture  exhibiting some of the most rapid  growth.  Most retail  and manufacturing  contacts  reportthat they have capital expansions  under way.  Some of the manufacturing plans  are quite ambitious.Many  of our contacts  characterized  labor markets  as tight.  Several  commented  that the quality  ofthe pool of people from which  they draw has declined.  Employers  claim to be resisting increasingwages  across  the board, although  the normal  wage  increase  seems to be edging up from what it wasa few months  ago.  It is now in  the 3  to 5 percent range.  In  addition, special  bonuses and  otherincentives  seem to be available  to more  and more of the workforce.  While  overall wage  levelscontinue to rise  only in the  moderate range  I have talked about,  our contacts  in the  temporary  helpbusiness commonly  report increases  of 10 percent or more, and in some cases a lot more.  Wageincreases  are particularly  rapid for people with technical  skills.  These workers in New England, aswell as elsewhere,  are in  very short supply.  Many  receive  offers of permanent  employment but arechoosing to stay in contract work.  The temporary  help agencies report  no difficulty in passing theincreased  cost of temporary  workers  on to their customers.  Salary pressures  are also quite intense,as you can imagine,  in the  asset management area.  One respondent  observed  that while the generalsalary pool increase at his firm is 4 percent, investment  managers  have bonuses like sports stars.Bonuses to existing employees  who refer new hires are becoming  more prevalent  along withsigning bonuses, and these referral bonuses typically  range somewhere between  $500 and  $2000.9/30/97Most companies  in retailing  and manufacturing  continue,  however, to  hold the  line onprices,  citing competitive  pressures.  Even  when prices of materials  or wages  have  increased, gainsin efficiency  have enabled  companies to  maintain  selling prices  without sacrificing margins.  Acontact  from a very large company  regarded  as one  of the  nation's most efficient observed that shesees  virtually unlimited  opportunities  for cutting  costs  and improving productivity.  Theseopportunities  often involve changes  in procedures  rather than specific new  capital  investments.I must say that I was impressed by  some of the  discussion when a trade mission  fromIndia recently  visited Boston;  the trade mission included India's minister of trade and industry andthe ambassador.  They  were talking  a bit about the boom in some  areas of the Indian economy.  Inparticular,  they talked about  how several hospitals  in the  Boston area now create  automated recordsduring  the day, which  are shipped overnight via telecommunications  to Bombay,  entered intoonline real  time databases there,  and then are  available  the next morning  for use by our hospitals,effectively a day or less from the time that they were created.  This basically  moves  major backoffice operations  out of Boston  to Bombay in  a way that seems to be  fairly easy to set up.  Theywere pointing to the advantages  that India has, and  it was  quite striking that this  improved  servicewas available  to hospitals  and other kinds of companies  that traditionally  have  had some difficultywith the productivity  of their back  office operations.  Another  contact attributed low  inflation toWal-Mart  and other retail  giants who have  taught companies to be just as difficult with theirsuppliers  as their customers  are with them.Real estate  markets throughout New  England continue  to be quite active, and we hadsome improvement  in previously lagging  areas, Rhode Island for one.  Prices,  however, areincreasing  as yet only modestly.9/30/97I was intrigued by Mike  Prell's discussion  of the Greenbook  forecast because  I think itaddressed a lot of the  differences  that we had  with  the Greenbook presentation.  We agree withyour assessment of the outlook for growth,  Mike, particularly over the  short run--that  is, over thenext 3 quarters  or so.  We have  some concerns  after that.  We think it likely  that unemploymentwill decline  to the 4-1/2 percent level  talked  about in the Greenbook  and that, at least in the  shortterm, inflation will creep up only modestly.  However,  we begin to have  some questions  after theshort term.  We question  whether the  appreciated  dollar will  stay where it is over the  entireprojection period  and have the impact on controlling  inflation that is  expected in  the  Greenbookforecast.  We  wonder whether we  are going to have more normal cost increases  in benefits.  Youtalked a little about that, Mike.  It is not featured much in the Greenbook,  but you did bring it intoyour discussion.  We think it possible  that more  normal wage  increases will begin to reassertthemselves sooner rather  than later.  I also question  whether the  impact from the decline in thestock market that we have been expecting for  so long will really begin to hit us in the early part of1998  the way both your  standard forecast  and your alternative  forecast  assume.It  seems that  aside from the dollar,  you are hanging  your hat  on two things to derive avery rosy forecast.  They are  a  100 basis point increase  in  the federal  funds rate and  a related  dropin the stock  market.  I want to question  whether,  if we  get on this bandwagon  a little earlier than isassumed in the Greenbook, we can do a little less  and have a little more  of an  impact on assetvaluations  going forward.  That would help to moderate  demand pressures  and reduce the risk that Ithink is apparent  in this Greenbook  forecast that the economy could get out of control earlier nextyear than we expect.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.9/30/97

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank you.  In addition  to our usual  advisory council meetings  andother contacts,  we  had a board  of directors  meeting  earlier this month  with all the directors  fromour three  offices and, in conjunction  with that, a breakfast  with some leading manufacturing  CEOsto talk about  innovations,  greater efficiencies,  and new products.  Chairman Greenspan  was presentto  hear these executives  as well  as the  directors.  So, if the way  I feed back what was said does  notfit with your impressions  and recollections,  Mr. Chairman,  you may want to add to or correct whatI have to  say here.We were trying to get  a sense of what was happening  within  companies  and  whether ornot that resonates well with what we see  in various economic  statistics.  Some  of the commonthemes  and responses  were  as follows.  The increase in manufacturing capacity  and in efficiencyand/or productivity as  seen by firms reflects in  part the very strong incentives  that they  all feel aswell as the availability of new technologies  that can  be used  to minimize their downtimes, tightentheir control of factor input costs,  and improve  the management  of their inventories.  They said thatthe incentives for much of that increase in capacity  and related productivity  would have been thereand could have been  accommodated even  without major expenditures  for capacity.  They  talked alot about the continued shortening  in product life cycles, and observed that the only way they couldhold prevailing product prices  steady  was through product  enhancements.  They doubted whethersuch enhancements  were  accurately  reflected  as different  products within  their own  firms, let alonein the statistics.  The CAD/CAM  technologies are  making it possible for them to shorten productlife cycles dramatically,  which then allows them to customize  the products  far more readily thanthey were able to before.  Also, they offer more frequent shipments  to their customers  as a way toreduce  the inventory costs of the  customers.  That  sometimes  allows  them to raise the posted price,but for the  most part it simply reduces the  pressure they feel to  cut their prices.  That is a product9/30/97enhancement  even though it would never be recorded  as  a different product  when it is simply madeavailable  more frequently.  Production  automation  means that  the  setup times  are dropping sharply,and  in turn that means  that business  firms  have more actual  capacity  even with the  same physicalplant facilities  and product  enhancements  are facilitated.Global competition  and outsourcing together  with the constraints  on pricing  areincreasing the  incentives  for innovating  and introducing  new products  at a faster pace.  I  got thesense that we were nowhere  close  to the end of that set of opportunities.  One newspaper  executivetalked  about how their overhead relative to total revenue  has been  falling  because  the same  supportexpenditures  are now  spread over much,  much larger volumes.  This is made  possible by newtechnologies  that have caused  a very  sharp drop  in production  and  distribution costs.  Steel  is oneindustry that was well represented,  and they  commented that over the last  10  years their industryhas had a major increase  in labor productivity  averaging  4.4 percent per year.  Over that same  10years, they have  experienced  a  57 percent  increase  in labor costs per hour with no increase  inproduct costs per ton.A little more on labor:  An  interesting twist on  what we have been hearing or thinkingabout the behavior  of unions is that they are now providing more  and more  intensive training  ofunion workers  to insure  that the productivity  of their members versus nonunion workers  issufficient to more than offset any wage  differences.  Within the  last  10 years, construction  andsome other  unions have adopted  what they now call a "lifetime-of-learning"  philosophy  as  a part ofthe rationale  for union membership.  The objective  is, of course, to have  their members stay indemand  as the  most highly-skilled  and therefore  the most highly-paid workers.  This  is a shift awayfrom earlier philosophies  of protecting jobs through  various restrictive  labor market practices.There was also  a claim that for office  workers we  are only beginning to see the kinds  of9/30/97technologies  that  will  allow  workers  to be  trained  and retrained  on a continuing  basis at their desksor their work stations.  How that might enhance productivity  also was  discussed.One note about the tightness  of labor markets:  It was  said that Wendy's  Restaurantsacross the  nation once had a notice in the center of every  table that  said "special  of the day."  Nowevery  table has  a list of "positions  available."Other directors  commented that  retail  sales went flat  last spring.  They characterizedretail markets  by saying that  "customers went  into a cave."  Then,  in the  course of July  and August,customers crawled out  of their caves and  started  to spend  at a surprisingly  strong  rate in the view  ofsome  directors.  Major retailers  reportedly  are growing more  confident,  and the expectation now isthat we will  see orders  increasing in the period ahead.With respect to the real estate market,  we hear that higher-priced homes  are  still stayingon  the market a relatively  long time  and that in  some metro  areas  overbuilding  is becoming  moreobvious in  what had been hot markets.  Our directors  expect that  situation to  get even worse.  Someof the  bank directors reported  brisk home  refinancing  in  the most recent weeks.  The  bankers  alsotalked  about increasingly  skimpy pricing in  their C&I lending.  They claimed  that banks  haveplenty of money to lend  and that everyone  is driving their volume  up to maintain earnings  in theface of slimmer margins.  One banker commented that  everybody is chasing  deals.Turning  to the national economy,  a  year ago we were looking  at  a near-term forecast  forthe fourth  quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of this year that looked satisfactory, with  nominalspending growth  in the 4-1/2  to 5 percent  range.  Of course,  that did not happen.  We were  verysurprised  at how much stronger than expected  nominal  and real growth  were in that period.  Thatwas a pleasant  development because,  at least in that period,  the rapid growth  was  not yet associatedwith an  acceleration  of inflation.  With  the advantage  of hindsight, we can  see that that condition9/30/97was  being  signaled by an  acceleration  of money growth.  We got  a lot  more growth  in broad moneybut also in the base,  sweep-adjusted Ml,  and MZM than was projected at the time of the  Septembermeeting.  Nominal  spending growth needed to  slow down,  and it did  slow  down in the  springquarter.  Money growth  also slowed down, providing a little  respite.  But money growth thenstarted to accelerate  again,  and we are now getting  upward revisions in the third-quarter  GDPnumbers, both real  and nominal.  I was out in San Francisco a  couple  of weeks  ago and LarryKlein,  who was on Bob Parry's  program, reported  that he uses a high-frequency  model to make  anew estimate  of the economy  every Monday.  He  has been revising  his forecast successivelyupward,  and at that point he  already had growth of 4 percent  in real and  6 percent  in nominal GDPfor this quarter.  He  said that each time he  makes this estimate,  the economy  looks a little stronger.That concerns  me because we again are  looking at a rather good  forecast in theGreenbook.  If this forecast turns  out to be correct with or without the policy adjustments it implies,I would be comfortable.  But I am more  and more concerned  that we are  likely  to be surprised  againin the near term by just how much stronger nominal  spending is than we are anticipating.  So, whenthe money numbers  accelerate  as dramatically  as they have  over the last couple of months, I see aneed for those increases  to slow and I am not comfortable that our policy  is right.  I cannotvisualize  the conditions  that  would allow me to accept  growth of the sweep-adjusted  monetary baseon the  order of 7 percent--and  that  growth is currently  accelerating--at  this stage  of the cycle.  Itsays to me that we more likely have  calibrated  the nominal  funds rates too low rather than too high.The way we usually look at real interest rates--the  real funds rate or some  other  realshort-term interest  rate--abstracts  from the idea that real interest rates have to be thought of in  arelative context.  If people in their decision-making  are  adjusting upward their expectations  aboutreal returns  on productive assets  in real estate markets,  equity markets, or elsewhere,  then real9/30/97short-term  money market interest  rates have  moved down in  a relative  sense even  if consumer priceinflation  has moved  down.  There  were references  earlier to the possibility  that boom conditionscould emerge.  If boom conditions  are starting  to  emerge  in the  minds  of people,  then the stance  orthrust of policy has become  progressively more expansionary  even with an  unchanged nominalfunds  rate.

MR.  HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  Tenth District economy  continuesstrong.  Our manufacturing  sector is still  operating  at very high levels of capacity.  District retailersare again experiencing  good sales  after a  slowdown this  summer.  The energy sector is strong.  TheDistrict farm economy is in  uniformly  good condition;  that includes  both our grain and  cattleindustries.  The construction  sector has shown some slowing  over the last several  months but fromelevated levels to more  moderate levels  of activity.  We have  seen some slowing  in our laboranywhere from 2 percent to 4 percent across  the  District.  In the circumstances,  our labor marketsremain  quite tight and we are  continuing  to see  some evidence of wage pressures  across the board.That  includes entry-level  workers,  technicians,  engineers,  and so  forth.  Wages  for entry-level jobsare now  reported  as  starting  at about  $10  per hour in the  Denver  area, and entry-level  wages  arerising elsewhere  in  the District.  Mike Prell  and others have mentioned  that  medical costs areexpected to increase,  and we too are  seeing evidence  of that.  In fact, who is  anexecutive  with said that they expect premium  increases  of 4 to 6 percent orhigher and  that half of the health plans in Colorado are now losing money.  So, they are  going topush to recover  their rising costs.9/30/97On the inflation front we have not  seen widespread increases  in prices, but there  areindications  of higher prices in  some  sectors  such as the transportation  industry.  Some of our majorrailroads  have pushed  through price  increases.  Their customers  have  complained, but since thetrucking industry  is doing  the same thing,  competition is not forcing the railroads  to back off.On  the national  level, I would be skeptical  about pushing  the concept  that we  areexperiencing  a new paradigm.  I do think, though, that business  cycles do not repeat themselvesexactly as we have  seen  in the past.  A host of special factors  seem to be affecting various  parts ofthe economy, but fundamental  economic  forces may well come back to bear on the course of thiscycle.  I am alerted to that possibility when I look at the level of resource utilization throughout theeconomy,  and that makes me skeptical  of the explanation  that we have a new paradigm that willlast.  I do not mean  to ignore some other developments,  which I will keep in mind when  Don Kohnpresents  his alternatives to us a little later.  These include  a real fed  funds rate that remains  high inan  historical context,  core CPI inflation that has been  trending lower, pipeline inflation that isessentially absent  right now, inflation  expectations  that continue to be stable for now, inflationindicators  that are pointing  downward,  a dollar that is higher at this point, and long-term rates  thatare  lower than they were  somewhat earlier.  That  is the  other side of the coin  that everyone  istalking about and debating,  and  we have to keep  it in mind as we raise concerns  about the level ofresource utilization and its implications  for inflation.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

MR. BOEHNE.  The economy  in the Philadelphia District currently  is performing muchas it has in recent months.  It features  steady growth  at a moderate  pace, tight labor markets,  andlittle or no upward pressure  on prices.  In commercial  real estate, vacancy  rates  are low  and rentsare  rising.  More  capacity is in train, however,  and rents  are expected to be under less pressure as9/30/97more  space is completed.  As yet, there is  surprisingly little  speculative  building going on in theThird District.  Although  wage  increases  seem to be holding at  around 4 percent,  there are morereports  of additional  perks,  signing  bonuses, and other incentives  to attract  and retain  skilledpeople.  With business  activity generally  favorable,  attitudes  are positive  but tough competitionseems to be providing  a restraining influence on the development of a boom mentality.Turning to the nation, we are in a reasonably  comfortable  position for now.  Actualperformance  at the macro level  continues  to be  surprisingly  good, and the risks to that favorableperformance  are largely  unchanged  from  recent months.  Like some of the rest of us, I didappreciate  the confessions  of a tortured staff.  Perhaps  the time has come for all of us to tortureourselves  less.  Most people  like to be right rather than wrong;  most would rather have the outcometurn out to be  better than worse.  The  problem here  is that things  have  turned out  to be better, butmost of us have been wrong.  [Laughter]  Depending on  one's mindset, each  of us will respondeither by saying,  "The  old model is still true; just give it time;  it will reassert  itself,"  or by saying,"There  is a new  model at work  and the world is indeed different."  My  guess is that the truth isprobably somewhere  in the  middle.  We just do not know  where  in the middle at this  point.  But Ithink the time has come for us to be less defensive,  and the way  we do that is  to adopt the stance  ofbeing  open  minded and alert and let the truth, whatever it is, fall out wherever it might.  In themeantime,  we make the best judgments  we can.  If we are right,  we are  right;  and if we are  wrong,we are  wrong.  But I do not think  we ought  to torture ourselves  any longer.

MR. PRELL.  I should  say that the word I used to describe  the Greenbook forecast  was"tortuous."  [Laughter]  I hope we did not torture the readers.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.9/30/97

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I have  little new to  report on  the Eighth  Districteconomy.  On balance,  economic  performance  has  improved  in the third quarter, as we hear  hasoccurred  in  other districts.  Sales  exceeded the  expectations  of many businesses.  District  laboremployment  growth.  For example,  the latest  Manpower survey  as well as  a recent survey  of smallbusinesses  in the District  show continued  strength  in labor demand relative to  the  supply ofqualified  workers,  resulting  in some pressure  on wages.  The market  for high-priced homes hasweakened  somewhat in  the District, but overall residential building has been held back more bysupply than by demand factors.  District  banking data are broadly  consistent with an  overallstrengthening  in  activity recently,  as reflected  in the apparent  year-over-year  growth in bank loansat a double-digit  pace in  the second quarter.  One problem  with this assessment,  however, is that thedata exclude what was the District's  largest banking institution,  now part of another District forstatistical purposes.The outlook  for the nation continues  to improve.  The substantial  upward shift in theGreenbook's  outlook for economic  activity in  1997  is consistent  with our view from the EighthDistrict.  Perhaps the most important reason for this  good outlook is that inflation  and inflationexpectations  have declined, facilitating  sounder economic  decisions and avoiding imbalances thatoccurred  in past expansions.  When the recession  started in the third quarter of 1990, inflation  asmeasured by the CPI had  accelerated  to 7 percent.  By the first quarter of 1991,  the CPI inflationrate had dropped  to 3  percent,  and it stayed near that level until recently.  This year the inflationrate has dropped  to an  annual rate of  1.6 percent through August.  We  should view  thisunanticipated  development  as  an opportunity  to take a step  closer to price stability, a  step thatwould put our inflation  performance  much more in line with that  of other  industrial countries.9/30/97Longer-term inflation  expectations  appear to have come  down  a bit in financial  marketsas well, perhaps reflecting  the view that we will lock in a rate  of inflation  lower than 3 percent.However, we have not  taken any important steps to do so as yet.  If anything, and Jerry Jordanmentioned  this in  a very  clear fashion,  monetary policy may be getting more  accommodative  asgauged by the growth  of money  and credit.  The broad aggregates,  M2 and M3,  surged  in the last12  weeks  and remain above  the upper bounds of their target ranges  for  1997.  We see a  similarsurge in the narrow monetary  aggregates  after adjusting for sweep  accounts.  These indicators  of anexpansionary  monetary policy stance  are consistent  with the continued  rapid growth  in bank creditwe  have  observed and  a readily available  supply of loans  for both consumers  and businesses.The Greenbook  is forecasting a  substantial acceleration  of inflation  and a significantincrease  in the federal  funds rate target in  1998.  If such actions are judged by the Committee  aslikely to be needed in  1998,  then why not adopt a tighter monetary policy stance  in  1997?  Policyactions while the  economy is  robust, as it is now,  might be  less disruptive than they would be  in asituation where  real  growth  is slowing  and inflation is accelerating,  as is  forecast for next year.  Alittle preventive  medicine  sooner, which is not a new theme in light of some  of the comments madehere today,  might avoid  such a dilemma later.  I realize  that markets would be surprised by such anaction because  we have not laid the groundwork  for it.  We have  not been explicit  about ourinflation  objective.  If we had been, markets  would  not be caught  completely off guard by monetarypolicy actions  to preserve the inflation gains we have experienced this year.  For all intents andpurposes,  those gains have brought us to price stability.  Indeed, markets  might react favorably  tosuch actions  since low and stable inflation  is  sound economic  policy.  Thank you.

MR. STERN.  Thank you.  The Ninth District economy remains  quite healthy,  and I haveasked  myself what has changed  in our area that might provide  a clue as to  the  future performance  ofthe national  economy.  The short answer to that is  "not much,"  but let me comment  on a fewaspects of the situation in any event.  District  agricultural conditions  are  mixed.  Livestockproducers  find themselves  in better  shape than they expected  and  are having their best year  in sometime.  On  the other hand, producers  of wheat  and other small grains  are finding themselves  in evenworse shape  than they anticipated,  both in  terms of the  size of their crops and the prices they  aregoing to get.  As Mike Moskow  commented,  the paper  industry  is doing better and probably betterthan it expected at this point in  time.  The  scramble  for labor continues in the District and,  ifanything,  it has intensified.  I would  say that there  is more commentary  among business peopleabout wage pressures  than I was hearing  a few months ago.  For the most part, that has nottranslated into price pressures  or price  increases  yet.  I have come across  a couple of reports offirms that, after not raising prices or at least not making price increases  stick in recent years,  havedone so recently,  and it appears  that those  increases  will stick.  So, there may be  something goingon there,  but I would say it is premature to conclude very much.As  far as the national  economy is concerned,  given the momentum that appears  to beunderlying  what is  going on, I have  some  sympathy for the changes  to the Greenbook  forecast.  Weare looking  at more real growth and lower inflation,  and  that is sensible.  But it does strike me thatchanges  to the forecast  could almost as easily have been  made in the opposite  direction on thegrounds that the unemployment  rate has fallen more rapidly than we anticipated, capacityutilization rates have risen, employment  gains have been larger  than can be sustained  in the longrun,  and all of that might lead us to believe that we are  going to see more inflation  and less growthin the  future, even  in the relatively near future,  than is envisioned  in the Greenbook.9/30/97However  that may be, my concerns  are heightened  a bit by some  analysis  we have doneon what I would  describe  as  proxies  for imbalances.  Of course,  these variables  are not infallible,but they all have moved into ranges  where  they are beginning to  flash some warning  signs.  Inparticular,  we have been  looking at the quit rate, capacity utilization  in manufacturing,  and the termstructure  spread.  Based  on historical performance,  all these indicators  are  now in ranges  where  wemight  anticipate  slower real growth and/or more  inflation  than in the Greenbook  forecast  some timein the next  12  months.  Again,  I would not want to make too much of that at this point, but for thoseof us who still have  some  faith in the old time religion, I do think that there may be some warningsigns out there.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Our Sixth District economy looks much theway it did  six weeks  ago,  and District activity  finished the summer at a pace that  looks much thesame as that for the nation.  The regionally important  tourism and hospitality industries could notbe stronger, and this is despite the  added capacity  that I reported at previous meetings.  At the sametime, we have seen some impact on tourism from  a stronger dollar.  Traffic  from Europe,  especiallyGermany, is down,  but that has been  offset  by a pickup in visitors  from other areas of the worldsuch as Latin  America.  Manufacturing  seems to  have slowed  somewhat after a  strong summer.Activity remains solid in  shipbuilding and energy.  Further expansion  from present levels  in the oiland gas drilling business is limited by the availability  of rigs, many of which are  being refurbishedafter having been written off earlier as unusable.  Our people tell  us that inventories  remain in goodbalance for the most part.  There is growing anecdotal  evidence  suggesting that continued  strengthin investment spending is motivated more by the  desire to cut costs  and improve  productivity  thanthe desire to increase  capacity in anticipation of future  growth.  In Alabama, where many  small9/30/97towns  dependent  on apparel  manufacturing  have been hard hit in recent years as I have said at acouple of meetings, we have  seen a welcome  influx of light manufacturing,  especially electronicsand high-tech.  Much  of that seems to be driven by the new southern  auto industry in that part  ofthe country.  Residential  construction in  our area appears  to be moving sideways rather than fallingoff to some extent as we expected  would occur by now.  Retail  and industrial construction  haspassed its peak, but office  construction is  still showing  some  acceleration  in the Southeast.  Retailsales were good  in July but slowed  again in August.No one is surprised  that labor  markets in our region  remain tight, although I would notcharacterize  them  as tighter than a year ago.  Perhaps that is because  our growth  was relativelystronger early in this expansion.  An interesting story that matches  some others  comes  from one ofour businessmen  in a very small meter-reading  business.  He said that he  was having a verydifficult time recruiting  young people  with good  driving records to run around  the community  andread meters.  His solution was  to hire two people in the place of one:  a retiree with  a legitimatedriver's license  and  a good driving record  who needed  something to  do and a young person withgood legs to do the running between  the houses.  He said the experiment has  worked quite well.This  is an interesting way to get around  the labor shortage in that area.  Despite  tight labor markets,we still are  not hearing  any reports  of significant wage increases.  Retailers  continue to tell us thatthey expect to get no meaningful  price increases  over the next six months.  And whilemanufacturers  say that their margins  continue  to narrow  at least  a little, even  small increases  inprices  are tough to pass  on, a now-familiar  story.At the national level,  we see the picture much the  same as most of those who havecommented  this morning: higher-than-anticipated  growth  and lower-than-anticipated  inflation.Like the Greenbook,  we too expect economic  growth to slow in the latter  part of the year and into9/30/971998,  partly due  to inventories  but  also reflecting moderation  in the  growth of investment spendingand in  the contribution  from exports.  We are not anticipating any  significant  new price pressures  inthe near term, but we  do expect an upward drift next year to the extent that energy prices  increaseand we lose  the moderating effect they have exerted  this year.I am not looking  at  Ed Boehne's notes,  but I too believe that we continue  to be in aperiod where  we should allow  ourselves  to enjoy the happy  combination  of developments  that  haveoccurred,  even if we do not fully understand  them.  My instincts, like almost everybody else's,indicate that the risks are  still somewhat on the upside and  that we are still likely to need to tightenat some later point down the road.  If I were more  confident that the economy would  play out aslaid out in the Greenbook,  I would be beating  the table for an early policy move.  I believe thatwhat probably has been  at work is not just the  good fortune of positive  shocks but rather the moresubtle and hopefully more lasting effect  of some years  of good monetary policy  and, in more recentyears,  of better fiscal policy and expectations  of more  of the same.  I think there is  at least areasonable  chance we  could continue  to be happily  surprised for  a while longer.  Thank you, Mr.Chairman.

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The rate of economicgrowth in the  Second District has held fairly steady since the last meeting.  The latest  figures onpayroll employment  suggest a third-quarter  acceleration  in the pace of job creation,  though thefigures were held down  a bit by the UPS  strike.  The job growth in New  York and New  Jerseyaveraged  an annual rate  of 0.9 percent  over the last three months, but if we remove the strike effect,the rate of growth actually  would be  about  1.7 percent despite  some drag from the public sector.Consumer spending  in our area is reasonably  good.  The retailers  are  happy and report that sales  are9/30/97a  little ahead of their plans.  In the real estate  area, the main characteristic  continues to be weaknessin upstate New  York and  some  further tightening of the space  markets in various parts ofManhattan.  Manufacturing  in the area continues  to be fairly good, again  with some drag from theupstate New  York area.  That was dramatized  recently  by Eastman  Kodak's  announcement  that  itwill cut at least  10,000 jobs; they did  not specify  where the cuts  would occur, but a  third of theirworkforce  is in upstate New York.  Within the District, consumer price inflation  averaged  2.2percent during the  12  months ended in August,  about matching  the national rate.On the national level, we do not have quite the drama in our forecast  of a 20 percentcorrection  in the stock market  or a 100 basis point tightening, but our forecast  is a reasonablyattractive  one  in any event.  We  look for GDP growth of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent in  the third quarter,but we then  have growth  slowing to about the trend  rate both at the  end of 1997  and into  1998.  Thebig variable, of course, is  the consumer.  We anticipate  that consumer spending will settle  down toa trend  growth  rate of about  2-1/2 percent,  and for reasons  related to the  question I asked  earlier, wethink that inventory  investment will be  a significant drag  on GDP growth  as will  net exports.  Wehave been happily surprised,  as has everybody  else, by the performance  of inflation  and actuallyhave reduced  our trend  inflation rate somewhat  for the balance  of 1997.  But we have inflationpicking up gradually  in 1998  and  1999,  hitting about  3.2 percent  in 1999.  That is measured  as itwould be today,  though the reported numbers  will presumably  be lower  as various technicalimprovements  are worked in.  We think the real  threat to the inflation  forecast  would be a strongereconomy induced  by higher-than-projected  increases in consumer spending.  We do not particularlyexpect that to happen,  but it does  make us believe  that the risk to the forecast is that the economywill be stronger than we  anticipate, and therefore  the inflation  risk will be somewhat  greater.9/30/97Since  some members  are wandering  into the  policy area,  I will  refer to our view  which isthat we do not need to tighten quite yet.  However,  we think the time  is coming  somewhat closerthan we thought  it was  a meeting  or two  ago.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Like Ed Boehne  and a few  others, I feel moved  to say a few things  aboutnew and old paradigms.  If one  listens  to the  economic  and financial  press and  sometimes  to theconversation  around this table,  one  gets the impression  that there are  only two possibleexplanations  for what is  happening  at the moment.  One  is that the economy's  functioning has  notreally changed  much over  the last 20 to  30 years.  In this  view, economists'  models  with theparameters  fitted to the  data of the last couple of decades  are  still good predictors;  it is just thatsomething temporary  or several temporary  factors are  giving us  more favorable  results right now.When these  temporary factors  turn around, everything  will  snap back into  place.  In particular,inflation  and low productivity  growth,  the bugaboos  of the U.S.  economy  since the late  1960s orearly  1970s,  will be  plaguing us  as much  as ever.The alternative  explanation  is that there is  a new  era or new paradigm, which actuallyseems to mean no paradigm.  In this view,  it is possible "to  have the cake  and eat it too" withoutworrying  about  productivity or inflation  because  the former  will be rapid  and the latter nonexistent.In  this  view,  economists are  to be  ignored if they say anything cautionary  about overheating  orbubbles  in asset values  or wages  outrunning productivity  growth.  The atmosphere  has  gotten alittle like the  policy discussions  of the early  1980s, which  I remember very clearly.  In that period,the  so-called supply side  economists  overwhelmed  the essential kernel  of truth in their thesis  thatincentives,  including tax incentives,  matter to economic  performance.  They made absurd  claimsabout the magnitude  of the likely  effects on labor supply or the saving  rate of small,  marginal9/30/97changes  in tax rates.  Those  who warned that high deficits  generated  by cutting tax rates  withoutcutting spending might  lead to either inflation or, with  a responsible Federal  Reserve,  to higherinterest  rates and a punishingly  high dollar were labeled  as  old paradigm  Keynesians  who were notto be paid much  mind.  It was not a helpful debate,  and  it led to bad policy and  an undermining ofconfidence  in the economics  profession.  Both  are things that  ought  to be  avoided.  [Laughter]At the moment, it seems to  me that we  ought to be focusing  not on new or old paradigmsbut on the fact, and it is a  fact, that while  economists  have learned  a great deal about how theeconomy  works  over the last two  or three  decades,  it is  demonstrably  functioning  better than any ofus thought it would.  Now,  good fiscal policy  and good monetary policy  clearly get some of thecredit  for this,  but there  is accumulating  evidence that the economy is  more flexible  and responsiveand less inflation-prone  than it used to be.  To my mind, one of the most gratifying charts  in theGreenbook,  meeting  after meeting, is the  inventory-sales ratio  chart, especially  in manufacturing,which keeps  trending down  and suggests that manufacturers  really  have learned  something  aboutinventory  management.More  fundamentally,  the surprising thing about the economy  at the moment is theuniformity in the activity levels  across the country  and across sectors  of the economy.  Laborsame  thing--not quite, but very close.  We do not really understand why this is true, but one has tosuspect  that there is more flexibility both in labor markets  and in production  location  than thereused to be.  Workers  move to jobs and jobs move to workers;  capital  moves more  easily nationallyand internationally;  and production  can be located  and expanded  in different  places,  includingoverseas  and across the Mexican border,  more readily than it used to be.  We have  heard some9/30/97wonderful examples  of this today--Cathy Minehan's  Bombay back office  for Boston area hospitals,as well as the maquiladora  process.The other surprising development  is the  apparent increase  in productivity  growth  at atime when the economy  has been  growing  for a long period  and the boom might be expected  to berunning out  of steam.  Economists  have  always given two reasons for the observed  slowdown  inproductivity  at  the peak of the cycle.  The first one never seemed  to me to make very  much sense,but we  all used to say to each other that we  were scraping  the  bottom of the labor market  andbringing in less  skilled, less experienced  people.  That was undoubtedly  true, but  a drop  from 5-1/2percent to 4-1/2  percent in the unemployment  rate, while a big  drop in  unemployment,  means anincrease  of only a little more than  1 percent in the employed  labor force.  And it is hard to believethat this  1 percent  of the  workforce,  however inept and  inexperienced,  could really  drag downproductivity  all that much.The other explanation that one  still hears is that old,  less efficient capacity  is brought online.  When  the old boiler  that does not  have to be used  until the firm is  facing  severe capacityconstraints  is finally brought  on line, it obviously  is less productive.  That also seems  to make lessand less  sense after  a period of very high investment  accompanied  by rapid technological  change.It  may be that the tight labor markets in the current environment  actually provide  incentives  forincreasing productivity.None of this  seems to be  a  reason for arguing that economists  do not know  anything orthat  staff is irrelevant.  It does  seem to provide a rationale  for at least  a tentative  hypothesis  that theU.S.  economy is less inflation-prone  today than it was in the  1970s  and  1980s for a lot of reasonsrelating to globalization,  information  technology, pro-competitive  developments,  and the safetyvalve that recent immigration  might have  given us in the labor market.  Econometrics  is a very9/30/97useful  thing, but it is inherently  conservative  in the sense that when parameters  shift, the equationspick this  up with a very considerable  lag.  At the moment, it is very hard  to defend the propositionthat economists  "know"  in  some sense  that an  economy  operating below 5-1/2  percentunemployment  is taking on  a  serious risk  of wage  and price increases.  We have been  operating inthat range now for quite  a while, and we  have not seen either  rapid acceleration  in wages or anyincrease in prices.  We still have  declining core inflation.The temporary factor most frequently invoked to explain  this is the high dollar, but thatis not a fully plausible explanation even  in an economy  that is much more open  than it used to be.This is  not a plea for new era thinking in  the sense of throwing caution to the wind.  It is a plea foreconomists to stop being defensive  and to try to figure out more carefully,  as the  staff here isactually  doing,  how this dynamic  economy  is really working.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  My view  of the economic outlook has changed  rather significantly  sincethe last meeting.  At that time, it appeared  that growth had slowed  more sharply in the  secondquarter than now appears  to have been  the case and that  growth might remain  near its sustainabletrend in the  second  half and into  1998.  To be sure, the risk of higher inflation remained,  but theslowdown  in growth and the recent favorable  inflation performance  removed  any sense  of urgencyto the policy decision.The crosscurrents  that underpinned  the earlier forecast,  specifically between  theprojected  slowing  in inventory investment and the  expected  rebound in demand,  seem well enoughin evidence  now  and continue  to underpin the forecast  of slower growth  in the second  half of thisyear.  But crosscurrents  do not necessarily balance,  and the crosscurrents  in question  apparentlyhave not yielded a return to trend growth.  Indeed, growth in  the third quarter appears  likely to be9/30/97about as  strong as  it was  in the  second quarter.  Perhaps  more importantly,  the ample  evidence  ofpositive  fundamentals  including,  I believe,  supportive financial  conditions  and the absence  of signsof imbalances  suggest that growth is likely to remain  above  trend for some  time in  the absence  of achange  in policy.  As a result, it now appears  likely  that the unemployment rate  will decline  to anew cyclical  low  in coming quarters.Three important changes  in  the Greenbook  forecast for this meeting  effectively highlightthe key issues in the forecast.  First, the  staff forecast for growth in the first half of 1998 wasrevised  upward to about  a  3 percent  rate, with the unemployment rate  falling to 4-1/2 percent bymid-1998.  Second,  a series of adjustments  and forecast  assumptions  were introduced  thatmoderated the decline  in  the unemployment  rate  and the rise  in inflation  associated  with a highergrowth forecast.  And third, the normal practice  of a constant funds rate, either nominal or morerecently real, was replaced  by a preemptive  policy response.  The key is the interaction  amongthese changes.  Even with the more favorable  assumptions  about the link from growth to inflationpressures,  the higher  growth path of the Greenbook forecast  yields an unfavorable  inflationoutcome, justifying  a preemptive  policy response.I believe that the risks relative to the  staff growth forecast  are  now more evenlybalanced,  and I would endorse  a preemptive  policy response to the projected  decline in theunemployment  rate and increased  risk of inflation.  I do  have some  reservations,  however, aboutthree changes  in assumptions  in this forecast, each of which worked to diminish the response  ofinflation  to the upward revised path of growth.  The staff revised upward  its projections  of bothlabor force  and productivity  growth, in effect raising the trend  rate of GDP growth over the forecastperiod and  as  a result moderating the decline in the unemployment  rate.  In  addition, the staffrevised downward  the response of wages and prices  to  the lower unemployment rate.  Mike Prell9/30/97referred  to these changes  as a flirtation  with new  era thinking.  They  are clearly  an effort to balancewhat I have called regularities  and possibilities.  Whatever  the merits of these  adjustments,  theyleave in  my judgment  considerably greater upside  risk to the  Greenbook forecast  of inflation  thanhas  been  the case in earlier  forecasts.I can appreciate  the conditions  that motivated such adjustments.  I too would like  to getthe inflation  forecast right for a change,  and I too want  to be  careful to balance regularities  andpossibilities in my forecast.  I can hardly  argue that the adjustments  that were made  are implausibleor that the productivity  path in the forecast  is unbelievable.  But this does change the balance  ofrisks,  in my view,  in relation to the Greenbook forecast.While  the policy change  is introduced in an understated  way in the Greenbook, it is  alsoan important  change in the forecast  assumptions.  It is notable not only because it is preemptive,  butalso because  the increase  in rates is  sharper than previously  assumed and begins earlier.  The policymessage  is clearer than it otherwise might have  been, precisely because  the  staff leaned so far withits forecast  assumptions  in order to limit the chance that the forecast overstated the  risk of higherinflation.I believe there are some interesting  similarities  today to the  situation we faced at theunemployment  rate had moved within a narrow range;  it was near the bottom end of that range,near  a cyclical low  and below  estimates of NAIRU.  The forecast for near-term  growth at thatmeeting was revised upward from the earlier forecast  of trend growth.  The resulting projection  ofabove-trend  growth was  accompanied  by a forecast of a decline  in the unemployment  rate to belowits recent rate.  As a result, the  forecast presented a combination  of utilization and growth risks thatcompounded  the threat of higher inflation compared  to the earlier forecasts  and  galvanized  support9/30/97for a tightening move.  Given  the changes  in the  forecast  since the  last meeting,  we  again face asimilar combination  of utilization  and growth risks  going forward,  and those risks  are  compoundedby the  fact that we begin  with an unemployment  rate nearly  1/2  percentage  point lower than was thecase  in March.  Fortunately,  we  also begin  at a lower inflation  rate.  But as  a proponent  ofopportunistic disinflation,  I want to hold  on to this  lower inflation  going forward.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The second-quarter  slowdown  was soshallow  that we could easily have missed it.  Consumer spending  did slow to less than  1 percent,but we had an  increase  in inventory  investment.  Even with that increase, inventories  are  still notout of alignment.  Growth so far in  the third quarter seems  to be quite robust.  I am particularlyimpressed  by the  uniform breadth of the  pickup.  Resource  utilization has  to be  getting rather taut,especially  for an expansion that has lasted so long.  This makes  the  recent inflation  experience  allthe more impressive.Going  forward,  there  seems to be  considerable  strength  in the economy.  Business fixedinvestment  is incredibly  impressive,  with support from falling computer  prices.  In addition,  thereare favorable  returns for fixed investment in  a wide variety  of areas,  not just computers.  Thisstrong investment performance  also is supported by strong profits  and cash flow,  providing internalfinancing.  The external financing market  also has been quite favorable,  with strong  equity andlong-term debt markets.  Bank financing  has also been available.  The balance sheets for bothfinancial  and nonfinancial  corporations seem to be  in quite  good shape.  With aggregate  demandappearing  to hold up, I do not think there  is any  reason to assume that the  nonfinancial  sector of theeconomy  is going to fade unless labor becomes the  dominant  constraint to expansion.9/30/97Turning  to the labor market,  I have  argued for a number  of months that  there is probablymore  flexibility in  that market than is implied by the  current unemployment  rate.  But at somepoint, it seems  to me  that flexibility has to  run out.  The staff's projection of 4-1/2 percentunemployment  in  1998  strained even  my optimism.  But I  have been  impressed  to hear how manypeople  around the  table  have bought into that projection.  So,  perhaps  I will have to reassess thatskepticism.Businesses  are  still  finding ways  to  economize  on their workforce  and attract newworkers  through  training  programs,  transportation gimmicks,  and  other approaches  such  as newways  of looking  at and trying  to implement  welfare-to-work  initiatives.  But it does  seem to me  thatU.S.  demographics  will not support job increases  of 200,000 per month forever.  The wagepressures  that  we now see in  the high-tech and  skilled areas eventually  will be more widespread.  Inany  case, the strong labor market  and the business investment outlook  augur well for continuedgrowth  in consumption.  This leads me to  concerns about resource  and  supply constraints.  Priceinflation has  been held down by  several  favorable  factors  including  the  strong dollar and weaknessin the economies  of international  competitors  that have been keeping pressure  off commodity andother supply  prices.  We  have not had any major supply shocks  for several years  in oil oragriculture  or wars  and  so on.  Even the much  discussed El Nino does not seem  to be having mucheffect  yet on prices.  Progress  on the deficit has helped to ease long-term interest rates, therebylowering financing  costs.  Inflation psychology  appears  to have  been considerably reduced.Businesses  and consumers  seem to be unwilling  to  accept price increases.In sum, it is hard to escape the conclusion  that the risk is on the upside for inflation.  ButI also think we  have little recent historical  experience to judge the impacts  of some of the factorsunderlying the  "new paradigm" economy.  I would also  throw in as significant in this argument  the9/30/97lower federal deficits  and  a U.S. economy  that is  now engaged in worldwide  expansion.  Otherfactors  are  global market  integration  and  few worldwide  supply shocks.  I cannot  fully buy into thenew paradigm,  but I agree  that its proponents  raise questions  for which we do not have  completeanswers.  It may  well be that we are experiencing  what is simply an elongated  cycle  and that moretraditional  strains will soon  be showing up.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  we head for coffee  in the next couple ofminutes,  it seems  to me that my notes  may be a bit of a composite of what has been  said around thetable.  As  I began  to focus on this meeting,  I asked myself first and foremost  "what is new?"  Theanswer  that came  back is "so  far, not much."  The  data story today seems to me to be  very much asit has been for some period of time now:  strong growth, tighter labor markets,  and very littleevidence of pressure on unit costs or prices.  As I look at the inflationary  pipeline to try  to get someclue of what may be  coming our way, it is very hard  to find  very much in the  way of new pressure.There  is some, but not very much.With regard to indicators of economic  activity,  we are  all very conscious  of what ishappening  in the labor market. We have  been discussing  that at length.  On the other  hand, we seeno pressure on unit labor costs.  In my view, I don't see much pressure  emerging  in capacityutilization,  except perhaps  New  York hotel rooms, Bill  (McDonough)!

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Boston,  too!

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  With respect to financial indicators,  one can find very little pressure  inthe  yield curve or in interest rate levels.  On the  other hand, household  wealth  continues to rise  andthere  is abundant liquidity  in the economy.  From the foreign side, there seems to be very little in9/30/97the way of new pressure,  and from the side  of commodities  or what one  might call goods inputs,none at all.So, on  its face, the appropriate  policy once again looks like steady as  she goes,asymmetric,  high alert.  In  short, little visibly has changed.  And yet, one has  to feel,  or at least  I do,a certain  heightening tension  driven mainly by the fact  that the  slowdown we  had been  expectingdid not happen.  It is not happening now,  and there  seems  to be very little likelihood that it is  goingto unless  it gets a boost or a jolt from here or elsewhere.  During the past four quarters,  growth hasaveraged  3.8 percent,  which is very  strong.  Unemployment has come down over that period  from5.3  to 4.8  percent.  And no matter how  guilty one  may feel about  harboring heretical  notions aboutlower NAIRUs  or higher productivity  or shifting paradigms  or whatever, one thing for sure,  asmany people have observed, is that there are  limits somewhere.  What is going to keep  theeconomy from pushing right  through them, wherever  they are?  There is plenty of liquidityavailable at reasonable  rates.  We are beginning  to worry about M2.  Household  wealth continues  torise; consumers  are very confident;  jobs are  abundant.  Our foreign  trade prospects  seem to befavorable  for more domestic  growth.  There is no meaningful fiscal drag.  The  Greenbook calls fortwo more strong quarters before  any  slowing  occurs, and when it does  occur, it is at least  in partbeing pushed by the possibility  of a stock market break and rising interest rates.Mr. Chairman,  at the  last meeting you commented  that there are  signs that we may berunning out the string, and it seems to me that those  signs are  multiplying.

MR. KOHN.  Thank your, Mr. Chairman.  The  sustained strength  infinal  demand  since the last FOMC meeting  and the staff projection of9/30/97building inflation  pressures  suggest that the  question  facing  the Committeeremains  whether, or perhaps  when, to tighten the  stance of policy.Prices in financial  markets do not seem to embody  this  asymmetry  ofrisks or potential Federal Reserve  action, perhaps  because, as Mike  noted,investors  have become  entranced  by visions of a new era.  I say investorsbecause, once  again,  a survey of economists  at primary  dealers taken inadvance  of this meeting  indicated that a majority--albeit  a  slimmer one thanin the near past--expects  policy firming by year-end.  Nonetheless,  futuresallowance  for such a rise in the federal  funds rate.  Moreover,  equity pricescontinue to  advance and  credit remains readily available,  both of which areconsistent with a lack of concern  that real interest rates  or labor costs  mightmove higher to impinge  on the growth of income  and profits  and the abilityof households  and firms to service debt.  If the economists,  including thestaff, are  right that risks are tilted toward higher inflation,  investor behavioris complicating  the Committee's job because  markets are  not acting as  anautomatic  stabilizer;  indeed, the  vigilantes  seem to have been lulled to sleepso that  financial  conditions,  if anything,  are exacerbating  any economicovershooting  that may be occurring.circumstance  would correct  itself to some extent without System action ifcost pressures  do, in fact, develop.  As  profit margins  disappoint,  equityprices will fall and lenders  may become  a bit more cautious.  However,such a reaction,  by itself, is unlikely to be sufficient or timely enough  toforestall potentially  emergent inflation  pressures.  With financial marketsdetermined  to be  optimistic, markets are more  likely to follow than to leadinflation pressures.If the Committee  sees a high likelihood that  the economy is or soonwill be producing beyond  its sustainable  potential,  action sooner rather thanlater would be  called for.  The longer  disequilibrium  is allowed  to persist,the more disruptive can be the actions  required  to correct  it.  TheCommittee has been  most successful  in recent years  and has minimizedneeded policy corrections by acting preemptively.  Following that pattern, ifthe Committee  were confident  of an intensification of inflation pressures,  itmight want to act at this meeting.But such preemptive  policymaking presupposes  a level  of convictionabout the outlook that the Committee  may not have today,  given  theuncertainties about price/output  relationships.  Allowing for the possibilitythat there may be no  disequilibrium lies behind  the arguments foralternative B.  In short, the persistent, unexpected,  favorable  behavior ofinflation of late may call  into question  our understanding  of the underlyinginflation process.  Moreover,  some of the projected  impetus to inflation9/30/97comes  from what will be, not what is already,  in the pipeline:  the projectedfurther edging down  of the unemployment rate  given  strong final  demandsand the ending of the restraining  force  of declining  import prices.  All ofthese  inflation influences  seem to have been  particularly  difficult to pindown  of late, and the Committee  may want to wait for surer indications thatinflation  will increase  before tightening.  After all, unnecessary  tighteningdoes have  costs in terms of lost output  and market disruption.  Moreover,with inflation  already fairly low, the Committee  may view the gains fromthe resulting  additional,  unintended disinflation as relatively  small.  Actiononce  those surer indications begin  to emerge may be effective  in restraininginflation, provided  such action  is prompt, and perhaps  relatively forceful,but the new elements  and uncertainties  in the current situation make  suchindicators--short  of the "smoking  gun" of a string of adverse  inflation data--difficult to identify.One class of indicators  the Committee has used in the past is earlysigns of pipeline price  pressures.  Price increases  for commodities  or goodsat early  stages of production  and the stretching out of supplier deliveriesand the like have been important not so much for their direct implicationsfor business  costs,  but rather as indications of pressures  on resourcecapacity.  They were  prominent in  1994, helping  to cue the need  for moretightening than originally  anticipated, and timely System action  did forestalla more general  increase in inflation.  However,  at this time, with industrialcapacity more  ample than labor force potential,  the cost and price  pressuresincreases in crude  and intermediate  materials  prices, pipeline pressures  maymanifest  themselves in a steady upcreep  in  labor costs  and a gradualsqueeze on profits.Another indication  that tightening  is in order might  be the continuedgrowth  of aggregate  demand beyond that of the economy's  potential.  Itwas  the threat of persisting unsustainable  growth in demand  that motivatedthe  Committee's firming in March, and the  current circumstances  closelyresemble  those the Committee faced  at that time, but with utilization  ratesin  labor and  capital  markets now higher.  Nonetheless,  the Committee maysee  some differences  in the  situations that counsel  caution.  For one, the realfederal  fund rates probably has been edging higher  without Committeeaction, as inflation  and inflation expectations  appear to have abated.  Foranother, the  flow of unexpectedly  good inflation news has been  extended,suggesting  a changing environment  or at least more uncertainty.  Despitethese  possibilities, the Committee  at some point still may want to considertightening  on the basis  of above-trend  growth and before even pipelinepressures  on prices  or labor costs are clearly  evident.  Growth that  isaccompanied  by rising utilization rates  is, by definition, unsustainable,  evenin  a new era.  If there are  no signs of moderation,  the Committee  may desire9/30/97some additional  assurance  that  it is not accommodating  a major build-up  ofinflation pressures  and subsequent  correction.In the  staff forecast, above-trend  growth  going forward  is  supported byaccommodative  financial  conditions, despite  high real  short-term  interestrates.  This circumstance  suggests  another set  of factors  that mightcontribute to  a decision to tighten--signs  that financial  conditions  werebecoming  even easier.  Unless potential  output can expand  considerablyfaster than now seems  likely, substantial  further  increases in equity prices,for example,  or a drop in the dollar, or a further  turn toward easier creditconditions  would seem inconsistent  with demand being damped  by enoughto  prevent  a further overrun of potential  output.  The  staff does expect mostnominal  interest rates to edge  higher, even  if the  stance  of policy  remainsunchanged  in coming months.  But a particularly  worrisome  sign might bean  increase in inflation  expectations  not coupled  with an  increase  in realrates.  This combination could  be read as signaling doubt about  the FederalReserve's  resolve to limit any potential  increase in inflation.  Thus  far, wehave been living  with the  virtuous part of the  circle of inflationdetermination:  Damped  inflation  expectations  have  themselves helped  tohold  down inflation  despite high resource utilization.  While the keyexpectations  in this  regard are  those on Main  Street,  a deterioration  on WallStreet that persisted could  be an  early warning  that the circle might turnvicious.Money  growth might  be one element  in assessing  whether financialconditions  have been  too  accommodative.  The  expansion of both M2 andM3  has been much more  rapid in recent months  than the  staff hadanticipated.  In part, the overage  seems to reflect  asset and liabilityallocation  decisions  unrelated  to current or future  spending:  Demand  forM2 assets  picked up in the wake  of the stock market weakness  in  August,and was reflected  in particular in rapid growth  of money market  funds; M3has been  boosted by bank  decisions to fund in U.S.  rather  than Eurodollardeposit  markets.  But  rapid growth  in M3  also is consistent  with ampleresources  being  available to the banking system to  support continuedaggressive  lending.  And  strength in M2  was  broader than just moneyfunds--nearly  all major categories  came  in above  our expectations.  Inrecent  years, with M2  demand  more  stable  and opportunity costs  notvarying  much, quarterly  variations in money growth  have been roughlycorrelated  with quarterly  variations in  the rate of expansion  of nominalGDP.  In this context, the third-quarter  pickup in M2  growth lookedanomalous  relative to the estimated  slowing of nominal  GDP, but  some ofthe latter now  appears  to be in the process  of being  revised away.  We arepredicting  a relatively  sharp  slowing  of M2  growth over the months of thefourth  quarter to keep  quarterly average  growth  from greatly exceedingpredicted  GDP.  Money  running  appreciably  above our forecast might be9/30/97one indication  that financial conditions  were accommodating  somewhatstronger spending than anticipated.At this point, a tightening would  catch markets unawares,  and  couldprovoke  a considerable  reaction.  Such a market reaction  would arise bothbecause  participants,  at least those  controlling the investments,  do notbelieve that  tightening  is necessary,  but because  they also may feel that  theyhave been  encouraged in this belief by Federal Reserve  statements.  Tosome extent market reactions,  occasionally  strong, are  desirable becausechanges  in interest  and exchange  rates and in equity prices are key links inthe transmission channels  for policy.  Strong reactions  and surprises  alsoare inevitable from  time to time in an uncertain  economic  environment  inwhich the Committee's assessment  of the requirements  of policy may notalways  match the markets'.  Moreover,  a sense that the markets  needed tobe primed for every action  could constrain  the Committee  undesirably,tying its hands to act  or not at certain  times depending  on marketpreparation.  In these  regards,  market surprise is just the counterpart ofmacroeconomic  uncertainty  and flexibility  in policymaking.  But surprisecan also grow  out of misunderstanding.  If markets  are to have a chance toperform  their stabilizing roles,  they need to understand the concerns  of theCommittee  and the risks  it sees.  These can be  clarified in  the Minutes  andelsewhere  without  pre-committing  the Committee  to particular policyactions or necessarily  expecting that  the markets will share the Committee'sviews  and expectations.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions  for Don?

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Don, you mentioned  that a  substantial slowing  in the growth  of M2 wasnecessary  for such  growth  to be consistent with the staff forecast of nominal  GDP in the fourthquarter.  The Bluebook has M2  growth  down to 4 percent  in November  and December.  Thissuggests  to me that  the growth  of overall commercial  bank balance  sheets--whether  we focus on  thedemand for credit, the supply of credit,  or some interaction  between  them--also has to deceleratevery sharply from what we have seen in recent months.  The balance  sheets  still have to balance.Given an unchanged  funds rate  and the Greenbook-type  forecast of the real economy, whatproduces that significant deceleration  in the  growth of bank balance  sheets  and therefore  moneygrowth?9/30/97

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  We have a modest  deceleration  in bank balance  sheets in the fourthquarter.  We do not have  a major deceleration.  Let me  start with the bank balance  sheet picture.We do not find the relationship between those balance  sheets and money growth to be very tight.Certainly, the  relationship between M2  growth and bank balance  sheets is not at all  tight.  There arejust too many other sources of funds for banks besides  M2  funds.  In fact, we have found that  therelationship of the balance sheets  and M3  also has  not been very tight.  One reason is that  whenbanks  substitute  domestic dollar borrowings  for Eurodollar borrowings, that  tends to boost M3growth and  vice-versa.  The  other factor has to do with the institution-only  money funds.  There hasbeen  a trend for those money  funds to compete  aggressively  for corporate cash managementbusiness.  In effect,  corporations  are moving away from the management of their own liquidity byputting it in the hands  of the  institution-only money funds.  We include the institution-only  moneyfunds in M3;  we do not include corporations'  own direct holdings of commercial  paper or Treasurybills.  Therefore,  that  substitution  also has tended to cut  the link between M3  and bank credit.  Welook at that  when we do our M3  projections.  We try to make sure the residual funding  of bankcredit, other than that provided  by the monetary  aggregates,  is sensible, but we do not force M2,M3,  and bank credit to conform  to the same  growth path.  We see a little  slowing in bank creditgrowth  in the fourth quarter, but not much.  It has been  very strong.  Business  loan growth inparticular  has been very robust,  and we think that  such  growth will slow  a little but  still remainquite  high.  We have  some further increase in business borrowing  needs  and some flattening  out, toa  certain extent at  least, in the  growth of profits.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Your  answer says that we can  get a slowing in  the broad moneymeasures without a  slowing in the growth of aggregate bank credit.  You  also suggested  in yourearlier remarks  that if we do not see the slower growth of, say, M2 that you are now projecting, that9/30/97might be evidence that  we are not getting the  slowing in  nominal demand.  If it is not anopportunity cost argument, what is the  argument that produces  the  slowing in M2 growth?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We track M2 growth  to the projected  increases in nominal  GDP.  Theslowing  in the fourth  quarter in M2 growth arises largely from our sense that there has been  a lot ofM2 built up over the months of the third quarter.  There  is enough to finance the nominal  GDP thatis forecast  for the fourth quarter.  In fact, there is  almost more than  enough because, even  with ourprojected  slowing  in M2 growth, we have  a slight decline  in velocity predicted  for the fourthquarter,  which is  an unusual event these  days.  Basically, we are saying  that there is enoughliquidity out there to finance the predicted  nominal  GDP with only moderate  further M2 growth.  Ifwe saw much more rapid further growth, we would wonder why people are  accumulating  those M2assets.  We would have to look carefully.  There could be an  asset allocation situation that was notrelated to spending, but it could also  be that people were  realizing  more income  and doing morespending.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Are there  any other questions for Don?  [Pause]  If not,then let me get started.I think the incoming indicators  are pointing more clearly  to underlying  trends  in thiseconomy, although  they are  scarcely adding to our understanding  of these  trends.  Let me start  withwhat I think is the most interesting event of recent weeks, the  extraordinary  acceleration  in capitalinvestment.  A big increase in capital investment this late in the business cycle  is really quitestartling.  If we focus on the  orders pattern,  we see  it suddenly  take off.  You will recall that thisexpansion  in capital  investment started to accelerate in  1993  after a very  sluggish period  and hasprogressed  at a fairly  pronounced rate.  This suggests that  anticipated rates  of return on  investmentshave risen.  More precisely,  prospective  internal rates  of return must be rising or else we cannot9/30/97explain why so many  firms  are  undertaking  large investment programs.  Part of the explanation  isunquestionably  the desire to expand capacity.  That is especially the case in the  high-tech areawhere  there has been very substantial  investment,  a not insignificant part  of which  has been  forcapacity expansion.  But there also is very little doubt that the plant managers  who propose thesenew  investments  anticipate  very significant improvements  in the  efficiency  of their operations,  andthat ultimately  leads to increased  productivity.  They look at it as cost reduction, but on aconsolidated  basis it  obviously nets out to a  significant drop in the ratio of hours to output, theinverse of productivity.We have several indications that the prospective productivity  improvements  may bematerializing.  First, the earnings figures  still seem to be rising.  It is too early to get a good fix  onthe third quarter--obviously  no reports  for the  quarter have come out--but security  analysts'estimates  do show  what appears  to be a seasonally  adjusted rise  in the earnings of S&P 500companies  for the third quarter.  Second, there  also is a quite surprising acceleration  inmanufacturing productivity in the data through August,  and it is now running  at an annual  ratesomewhere  around  7-1/2  percent.  To be sure, the  August figure  is a little suspect because,  as youwith a presumed  productivity number.  But that is not the case for July.  Apparently,  there  was aquite significant  and  surprisingly strong  rise in electric power use,  and all other indicators  suggestthat  July IP was quite strong.  So, manufacturing  productivity  appears to be rising  at an  annual rateof about 7-1/2 percent  for the third quarter.Third, although we have  little available data, the evidence  we do have for various typesof facilities is consistent with a general pattern  of improved efficiency  and flexibility.  I havementioned before that with the ratio  of unfilled  orders  to shipments declining in  the capital goods9/30/97area, specifically  excluding  aircraft,  we are  getting a pronounced  and inexorable decline in the leadtimes  on the deliveries  of capital equipment.  In  a sense,  this is consistent with the product cycle ina variety of other areas.  There is no  doubt that we  are  seeing  a fairly marked decline  in leadpatterns  and an increase  in the  ability of companies  to meet unanticipated demand  rather  quicklythrough  new facilities, whereas they could not do that before  in  any readily  observable  sense.  Weget confirmation  of this phenomenon  if we compare  the vendor performance  numbers of the NAPMwith the capacity  utilization  data, either  for primary processing  or for total manufacturing.  Whatwe  see is progressively  lower vendor performance  numbers  at successive  peaks  in activity.  Thismeans  that the bottlenecks  and shortages  are falling relative  to any constant  operating rate.  This is,in effect, consistent with the declining  lead times.  At the end of the day, one would presume thatwe  could keep  squeezing  and squeezing  and, as indeed the new era people like to say, capacitywould no longer be a restraint.  If we  literally stayed with the  facilities  that are  coming  on stream,there  is a strange degree  of verifiability of that.  We  can see that there  are  very few  constraints,  veryfew  shortages.  For example,  the list of shortages  we get from NAPM  now has one or two items,whereas  we used  to get  15  or 20.  Something  different is happening in the facilities area.  This hasled a large number  of executives,  mainly in the corporate  area which  is where the forefront  of thenew era issue  is arising,  to conclude  that technology is continuously  enabling facilities  to be lessand less a constraint  on activity.  Indeed, when we include the  globalization  factor, it looks asthough  inflation is dead, the  world has changed,  and the central  bank ought to  get out of businessone way or the other.The major element  that is missing in that argument is biology!  Biology is what onelooks at when we  are trying  to find the  lead time, not on  facilities,  but on people.  I know of noevidence suggesting  that that factor has been altered in any significant manner.  As a consequence,9/30/97leaving  aside the question  of the unemployment  rate, the NAIRU  or whatever,  we have  afundamental  disequilibrium in the  labor market best characterized  by the fact  that employment isrising by  2 million each  year  and the population  of people  of working age  who wish to work,including  immigration, is going up  1 million annually.  The  1 million difference  between those  twostatistics over the last three or four years may be broken down  into a net flow of 600,000individuals per year who moved from unemployment  to employment and  another net flow of400,000 people  per year who moved  from "not in the  labor force  but say they want a job" to beingemployed.  Remember, the definition  of unemployment  requires that a person be  making an  activeeffort to  secure  a job in  the previous  five weeks.  The consequence  of saying  "I would like  a job,but I have  not been looking"  is that it throws that  person out of the  labor force.The group of people  outside the labor force  who say they want a job has contributedalmost as much as the decline in  unemployment to that difference  between  employment  increasesand the growth of the  population of people  who wish to work.  This group  of people  is now at thelowest proportion to the working age  population  since  1970.  I cite the year  1970 solely because thechart I got from the  staff goes back only that far.  There  have been  some very  dramatic  declines  intheir number since  1996 as employers  have drawn very heavily  from that group.  We do not need  toconsider the NAIRU  and the unemployment rate because,  while they obviously  are  moresophisticated  approaches  to this issue, we do not have to  get terribly sophisticated.  All  we have todo is to observe where the unemployed people  are,  and there  clearly are  fewer  and fewer of them.Since  early 1996, we  have seen  a rise in average hours worked.  That is another way ofsuggesting  that the pressures  that we are  seeing in  this taut labor market are inducing employers  tosqueeze  the available  supply of workers.  If the supply were  really there,  we would not be  gettingthis type of pressure on the average  workweek.  I think this pressure has  been the equivalent of9/30/97about  500,000 additional  workers  at  an annual  rate, so that the comparison  would really be  2-1/2million  versus  1 million.I have  argued before  that  we have not seen  an acceleration  in wages  because of the jobinsecurity phenomenon.  We have seen  significant evidence  of that phenomenon  in the  last fiveyears.  The latest evidence  that has come  to my attention is data on the quite dramatic  increase  inthe number  of people  aged  25  to 34 who are  going back to  college and the huge  increase  in  theamount  of on-the-job  training.  There  is an  awareness  that  one can  no longer  count on gettinglifelong job skills just by getting  a college  degree  or even a high school  degree.  What we arelooking  at is still, as far as  I can judge,  a fear of job skill obsolescence  and a significant  shift towardjob security  in lieu of wage  gains.I have maintained  in raising this  issue over the years that there  is a limit as to how farthis job insecurity effect can  go.  We are  beginning  to see some  signs that that limit  has beenreached.  Earlier polls indicated that  from  1991  to  1995 job insecurity  or fear of job layoffs  hadrisen very  significantly  despite the  tightening of the labor market,  but the responses  in these pollshave now shaded  off in  the other direction.  The  proportion  of people in the labor force  wholong period of time, has  now popped  up, suggesting  less job insecurity.  So,  the data that tended toargue  for job insecurity  are beginning  to shift a little.  They have  not reversed  sharply,  but they arebeginning to  be shaded.The question that we are running  up against  is that all of this is plausible,  but in  effect westill have negligible  inflation  in the  system.  It may very well be  that productivity increases  arecreating enough  in  the way of absorption  of hourly  labor costs to prevent  rising prices.  Indeed,there is no  evidence  to suggest that there is any  pipeline inflation or  any other type of inflation.9/30/97The  fundamental  disequilibrium,  and I don't see how  we can get around it, is the fact thatthe rate  of increase in overall demand  is creating  a demand  for employment  that cannot be satisfiedindefinitely.  The trouble  is that  we don't know where that pressure point is located,  but it has toexist.  I think, as Mike Kelley  said, there have to be  limits.  Larry Meyer also said that  in a speechthe other day.  We do not know exactly where  the limits are  at this point, but the longer we stay onthis course, the more this disequilibrium continues to spread.  It is conceivable that  productivitycould accelerate  to the point that labor requirements  fall without a change in  overall domesticdemand.  There is no evidence  of which I  am aware  to suggest that outcome  because  employmentstill  seems to be growing  at a fairly  good clip.  It is conceivable  that we may suddenly findemployment  growth  starting to fall short  of its current trend while output growth is  maintained,which would suggest that productivity is accelerating,  but at the moment  there is no evidence  ofthat in the data.Although  it is conceivable  that we may get bailed  out by a sudden  discontinuousacceleration  in productivity growth, that is something that  has not occurred in the past to myknowledge.  There is no doubt,  however, that  a lot of the  synergies  of the new technologies  areemerging.  That development  is producing very large investment opportunities.  The joining  oflasers  and fiber optics has created huge demands  for telecommunications  investment.  Thecontinuous  breakthroughs  in the computer area in conjunction  with the new communicationssystems created and  are now fostering the extraordinary expansion  in the Internet.  So, one canargue that it is possible that we could  get enough acceleration  in productivity  to close  the gapbetween labor  supply and labor demand.  However, the gap looks so large to me that I will suggestthat  arithmetically  we would need a full percentage  point  acceleration  in productivity  increases  toclose the gap.  Is it possible?  Yes.  Is it likely?  I do not think we can depend on that.9/30/97With respect  to policy, my view is that we  are getting  repeated reprieves because  theprice level  is not changing much.  I do not think  we  should move today, but I do  think theprobability  that we will be  forced to move  at the next meeting  has gone  up quite considerably.  Idon't know how high that probability is,  and I do  not know what we would  do if we  ended up witha CPI of zero in the next report.  We  will  be  getting the ECI between now and the next meeting,and it could show  an increase  of 1 percent.  I doubt it, but who  knows?  In  any event, I think we  aregetting close to a policy  move.  It is important, for all  the reasons  that a lot of you have stated, to bein  front of the curve.  We are not arguing  that the probability  of rising inflation  has increased,  butthe possibility that we  may be wrong  is rising.  You do not need an above 50 percent probability  ofbeing wrong to take out  insurance.  I don't know what the data are  going to look like in the nextfour or five weeks, but my guess  at this stage is that there is easily  a 50/50 chance  that we willto  move is not going to be something  about which a  lot of us  are  going to be enthusiastic.  In anyevent, I am putting on the table a  "B"  directive  with continued asymmetry.  Vice Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I very much believe  that what youhave recommended  is what we  should do, and let  me briefly give  some reasons.  The  factorsleading to a combination of good  economic  growth and ever better price performance--a  firmdollar, restrained wage  demands, and the excellent  performance of health benefit costs--clearlyhave to be transitory  and cannot be  depended on to continue  to give  us the present  combination  offavorable  developments  as we move forward.  I do not think we can bet on faster productivity  gainsbecause  such  a bet would involve  a leap in the  dark.  We have a sufficient  basis in the transitoryfactors  that I just mentioned  to explain why we have  had the good economic  performance.9/30/97Therefore,  I think it would be  bad policy to maintain the  present stance  in  the expectation thatproductivity  gains might  bail us out.If that is  the case and policy needs  to be changed,  then the question obviously is, whywait?  We have been  telling the  American  people, who are infinitely more  important than theand that price stability is a  means to that end.  With sustained economic  growth clearly taking placeand with price performance  even better than anyone  had anticipated,  including  us, we need to dosome informing of the public before  we move.  Since the  likelihood is,  as you have  suggested,  thatwe will  wish to firm policy at the next meeting,  I encourage  you to seize an  opportunity in a speechor Congressional testimony  or some other avenue  where you can lay out the line  of thought thatyou just gave,  including the wonderful  news  that we have  fewer discouraged  workers,  more peoplecoming into the workforce,  and all the other favorable developments  that,  as you suggested,  can beand should be  mentioned as evidence  of the  great success achieved  in the functioning of the U.S.economy.  I think that type of presentation  to the public would make people understand, though notall would like it, why we would choose to firm policy in  the near future, and I encourage  you tomake that presentation.  In my view, that is the kind of thing that has to be done by the Chairman  ofthe Committee.  Others  can  say what they like to be supportive,  but it really is only the Chairmanwho speaks for the Committee.  Therefore,  I think it is important  that you do that  before the nextmeeting.I very much believe  that at the present time "B"  asymmetric  is the right policy choice.

If some  of our labor force is inBombay  or Mexico,  and we have much more flexibility in outsourcing and even  in calling on high-skilled people in  distant places, then this argument  is  a little less overwhelming.  I guess I also havebeen  a little more  skeptical  about the job insecurity  explanation  of why we have had such limitedwage increases.  That puts a lot  of the  explanation  on the worker side.  I think we also have  had  astrong disinclination  on the employer  side to grant wage  increases  because  of the correct perceptionthat the economy is very competitive  for numerous  reasons,  including the reasons we have  beentalking about.  That said, I think we need  to accumulate  more  evidence before taking action,  butyour policy recommendation  is the right one for today.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Could I  add a comment?  Just a brief one?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Sure.9/30/97

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  We have  been doing  a good deal of work at ourBank on where  inflation  stems  from on the wage side,  and it is not in the goods-producingindustries.  Therefore,  the  labor force that does  exist in Bombay  and Mexico does not help toexplain our wage behavior because inflation  comes  from the  services part of the economy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The Bombay  example involves  services.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  But for most services  there is no importcompetition.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The Bombay example relates  basically to the use  ofcomputer  software.  It involves  very few people.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  The portion of the workforce  that is most likely togive us the inflationary  pressure,  at least on the  basis of our analysis,  is in the services  areas  wherethere is no  possibility of competition  with imported services.  That pressure initially kicks off in thewages of service workers,  but with a not very long lag  it seems to spill  over into general  wageinflation and  over into the  price side.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  given uncertainties  about the magnitude of a possiblesupply  shock, I am somewhat  more  comfortable  with data and forecasts  of nominal GDP growththan with forecasts of the split between real  GDP growth  and inflation.  Nominal GDP has grownmoderately  over the past year  and is projected  to slow in  both our forecast  and the Greenbook.  Ithink there  is a reasonable  chance  that nominal GDP growth will  slow,  and such an  outcome wouldmake it unlikely  that a significant inflation  problem would develop.  Therefore, I am willing toleave the  funds rate unchanged  for now, and I can support Bluebook alternative  B with asymmetriclanguage to the upside.  I do believe,  however, that a  strong case can be  made to take out a small9/30/97insurance  policy against the likelihood of higher future inflation,  but delaying  such  a decision until,for example,  November is not likely to be  the difference  between success  and failure.

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  without putting  odds on  what we need to do at the nextmeeting, I think I understand where you  are coming from, and  I can support your recommendation.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I agree  with your recommendation,  and I have  an open mind about whatwill occur in November and December.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I agree  with your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman.  I do think that theprobability is higher that we  will have to move in November than I thought it was,  say, four or soweeks  ago.  I agree  with President McDonough  that it is very  important for us to alert the Americanpeople  to our thinking.  I know this is  a delicate matter because we  are waiting for data to come induring the next several  weeks before we  know for sure  what the probabilities  are  going to be.  But Ido think it is important that you  lay the  groundwork  for any move that you anticipate  theCommittee would want to make  in the future.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I thought I was  doing that in the July  Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony.  It  turned out that instead of the bond market  falling by up to a point  or so,  as I thought itwould after that testimony, it went in the other direction.  The market's response depends  on what itwants to hear.  One of the things I have learned  is that sending  a message is very  difficult unless itis absolutely  unequivocal  because  people  hear what they want to  hear.  It is  a tricky matter.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I thought you were  very effective in sending a message earlier thisyear.9/30/97Guynn.

MR. GUYNN.  I support  your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I would prefer alternative  C but I could accept  yourrecommendation.  The stage  setting is probably  very important,  although  I think we need torecognize  that at some point it may be only actions that will get the  message  across.  I think, as  wasclear in my comments today  and earlier, that the odds of our having  to act are  quite high.  Insending a message,  I believe it is very important that we  focus on the  benefits  of low inflation  andspecifically the benefits of locking in the very low rates  of inflation  that we have  as opposed  to theevils of rising inflation.  That approach has  the potential of playing better, and Bill McDonough  hadsome good thoughts  with respect to your talking about this.  We cannot come across  as takingcredit for the current economy, but we can certainly relate  some of our  argument to the benefits  weare enjoying today in this economy that  is creating a lot of jobs and opportunity.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stem.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too,  accept your recommendation  largelybecause  I think there is still  sufficient uncertainty  to warrant caution.  While it is tempting to takethe attitude that we ought  to sit back and enjoy this  economy, I see a danger  in that.  The danger  isthat we will wait too long before acting,  as has occurred  on occasion  in the past.  We ought  toremain sensitive to that possibility, and that leads  me to  view November with  a good  deal ofinterest.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.9/30/97

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree with you and I endorse  all elements  of your policyrecommendation:  no change in the funds rate today;  maintaining an  asymmetric  directive;  and,importantly, recognition  that there  is an increased  possibility,  if not a presumption, that a tighteningmove  will be justified in November,  assuming the data between  now and then confirm the thrust ofthe  Greenbook forecast.My  view is that monetary policy should continue to lean against the  cyclical  winds andbe cautiously preemptive.  In my view,  such a preemptive  move might  well be in order at the nextmeeting.  By that time, we will  have  two additional employment reports, the  third-quarter ECIreport,  and a better feel  for the  momentum of the  economy early in the fourth  quarter.  This timingis also consistent with my view that there  are windows  of opportunity for policy tightening.  We arenot, in my judgment,  at such a window  at this moment,  but I expect we  may be approaching one.  Itis easier to change policy, for example,  when the  financial markets  anticipate  a move  and when thepublic will understand  it.  It  is easier  for this reason to tighten when growth is above  trend and  theunemployment  rate  is moving  lower than when the economy has slowed  to trend and theunemployment  rate has stabilized,  whatever its level.In my view, to  maintain  a preemptive course, to sustain the decline  in inflation we haverecently  achieved,  and to take  advantage  of a possible  window of opportunity, we should beprepared  to tighten in November if the data confirm continued  above-trend  growth and  risingutilization rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I can accept  your recommendation.  I also agreestrongly with the thrust of your comment that  the probability of having to tighten  in November hasrisen significantly.  I hope that you will make some  public comment,  and I  agree  with Bill9/30/97McDonough  and others that doing so  would be productive.  I recognize  that it is difficult to deliverthe message,  but I think some comment  would be  in order.I would just add  that a principal  reason in my view  for the considerable  success  of ourpolicy  over the last three years  as  a whole is our  consistent commitment  to hold  the line on inflationbuilt largely on our preemptive  tightening actions  in  1994.  That  series of actions was one  of themost successful we have  undertaken  in recent monetary policy  history in this  country.  And it wassuccessful  precisely because  we  acted proactively  rather than reactively.  Because of that, weearned the public's confidence.  There is a lot of talk about  a new paradigm.  I think that increasedconfidence  and credibility  is a big part of that new paradigm.  But that confidence  has to benourished,  and I think there is a good chance  for  you to do that in November.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I, too,  am supportive  of your proposal,  Mr. Chairman.  I  also wouldhave  supported  a small preemptive  move at  this meeting,  but I recognize  that the lack of a realsmoking  gun in terms of inflation, either existing or in the pipeline  or guessed about,  makes thatsort of recommendation  a bit difficult to entertain  at this  point.  I agree with  Alice Rivlin that  weprobably  are facing  a less inflation-prone  economy  than might  have been  the case in earliermore transitory  than new  paradigmish  and their effects may be coming  to an end.  I think benefitcost increases,  wage  increases  in the face of increasing  labor shortages,  and the potential  for areduction  in the value of the dollar given the  large  size of our external  deficits  will  at some pointstart to work together  to make this  less inflation-prone economy  more inflation-prone.  I agree withthe comments  about being forward-thinking  and locking  in the benefits  of reduced inflation.9/30/97I have some concern  about the idea of communicating to the markets.  With respect towhat you  said in  your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony,  I told a lot of people to read the wholetestimony, not just what was  in the  headlines  of the New York Times  or the Wall Street Journal.There  was a good deal  of balance  in  that testimony.  I think it is really  difficult to communicatethese things in such a way that people  understand  the intended message.  Don Kohn  made somegood  comments to the effect that surprising  the markets,  particularly in a boom-like environmenteither existing or building, is not all  that bad a thing.  I  wonder whether we  can communicateeffectively in the absence  of real inflation,  but I think we need to move before  real inflationmaterializes.  In my view,  anyway, there  is more than  a 50 percent probability of our moving  at thenext meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I think what is going on in the labor markets  is a fascinating subject, onethat I wish I understood better.  I also wish that our friends  on the European  continent understood  alot better than I do what is  going on in our labor markets.  It does tell  us a lot about the distributionof the current prosperity  and about  how well  all the wealth creation  is being  shared by our people.But I am not sure it tells  me a lot about the  purchasing power of money,  at least not in a direct way.I also am very interested in  all the discussions  about capacity,  capacity utilization, productivity,efficiency,  and  capital formation because even  though they too don't tell me  anything directlyabout what is going  to happen  to the  purchasing power of money, they  give important informationabout things that I think directly  bear on the  purchasing power of money.  The demand for labor isa derived demand;  it is derived from the demand for goods and services.  That in turn,  as Bob Parrysays, depends  on nominal  spending, which does  have something to do with money.  I am lesscomfortable  than Bob seemed to be that  we will  get the needed  deceleration  in nominal  spending9/30/97growth.  But with respect  to the stories  about productivity,  capacity,  capital formation,  and all ofthat,  if the perceived  real return to productive  capital  is rising due  to technology,  including bothwealth effects  and  substitution effects, that  indicates  to me that  the demand for high-poweredmoney  must be declining.  But what we see is an  increased  demand  for bank credit  to finance  it all.That effect is  somewhat like that  associated with the old real bills doctrine  when it signaled  whatwas  interpreted  as  an increased demand for base money  while modern  theory tells us  the  quantityneeded  to go down.  We  should not be seeing  an  acceleration  in base  money  growth at this  stage.So,  I think that we are probably  late.  What I would be  looking for in the  next six weeks  is whatDon Kohn  alluded to,  namely the much needed  deceleration  in the broad measures of money.  If wedo not get  it, then  I will  conclude that we made  a mistake.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I agree  with your recommendation  today.  I would keep  an  open mindabout the next meeting  and wait and see what  the data show and not be praying  for bad news so  wehave  an excuse  to do something.With regard to 1994,  I do think it was a very successful  preemptive strike  experience.Two fundamental  differences  between  now  and  1994 are that we went into  1994  with a  3 percentfederal  funds rate, zero  in real terms,  and had been there  1-1/2  years.  Also, throughout  1994,  we9/30/97had pipeline  inflation  going straight up.  Commodity  prices peaked in mid-1995  and have not goneup since then.  Those  are two important  things to keep  in mind.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That explains  why we have  not moved since  March.Okay, let's have  a vote on "B"  asymmetric  after you have  read the directive.

MR. BERNARD.  I will be reading from page  13  of the Bluebook:  "In  theimplementation  of policy for the immediate future, the  Committee  seeks conditions  in reservethe  context of the Committee's long-run objectives  for price  stability  and sustainable  economicgrowth, and giving careful  consideration to economic, financial,  and monetary developments,  asomewhat higher  federal  funds rate would or a  slightly lower federal  funds rate  might be acceptablein the intermeeting  period.
