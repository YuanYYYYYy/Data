CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  first  item on  the  agenda  is  approvalof  the minutes  of  the July 2-3  meeting.  Would  somebody like  to movethem?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Peter  Fisher, youare on.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will  be  referring  tothe  two  pages  of  color charts distributed this morning.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Peter,  I think we have all  been  aware ofa tendency that  seems  to  go  against our  theoretical preconceptions.  Iam referring to  occasions when we  have seen  a significant  rise  inlong-term  interest  rates, which one  would presume would have a firmingeffect  on  the dollar.  Yet,  what obviously was happening  on  some dayswas  that heavy  sales  of  dollar-denominated securities  were made inpart against purchases  of  foreign currencies,  and the dollar weakenedas a result.  Have you been  able  to  segregate  those  episodes  in whichthe  rise  in U.S.  interest rates dominated what happened to  the dollarin  the  foreign exchange market  or  alternatively the  sale of  securitiesdenominated in U.S.  dollars  to  purchase other  currencies was  thedominant  force  in  determining the  exchange rate  for  the dollar?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We  have  not  tried systematically to  segregatethose  episodes.  We have  observed the phenomenon  that you referred to,and  that  is  something we  could try to  do,  although it  is  quite  tricky.I think the  causation  tends  to  run in both  directions at  times  such asthose you are  referring  to.  So  I am not  sure--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  is  required here  is  that  sales  ofsecurities  denominated in U.S.  dollars occur against  purchases  offoreign currencies.  The mere  sale of  U.S.  securities  does not  in andof  itself have  any impact  on  the  dollar.  Is  there any additionalevidence  related to  those  episodes  that  could conceivably give us  someinsight  into which way the  pressures  on  the  dollar would emerge  or dowe face  a hopeless  task  if  we try to  disentangle  those marketepisodes?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I do  not want  to be  quoted  as  saying it  ishopeless,  [laughter]  but  it  may be  akin  to  looking for  a needle  in  ahaystack.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You will  look nevertheless.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It will  be  quite  a challenge.  Let me  thinkabout  that,  and maybe Don Kohn and  I can come up  with ways  to  sort  itout.  It  really  is  tough  to  do  much better  than  to  talk  to as  many ofthe  major market participants  as  one  can and get  a sense of  what  theywere  seeing major accounts  doing.  Sometimes  those  accounts  areliquidating bonds and moving out  of  the dollar at  the  same time,  andsometimes  they are not  doing it  coincidentally, but  the  effect  may bethe  same  if  they  are  doing it  over a period of  time.8/20/96I strongly share  the  impression that bond markets  are  tradedmore  and more each year as  we  think  foreign exchange markets  aretraded,  that  is,  as  a collection of  currencies.  Traders  areconsistently thinking  that  if  they move  out  of  one  currency orgovernment bond maturity, they will  move to  some  other currency ormaturity automatically.  It  is  not automatic  in  the  sense  of  being byrote because  traders  do make  a conscious  decision as  to  what  to moveinto.  So,  we  think people  are trading bond markets as  if  they werecurrencies but  it  is  very hard to  pin  that down.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Could we at  least  look  at  the  Desk'srecords  to  identify these episodes  and see what proportion wereassociated with  a weakened dollar and what proportion with astrengthened dollar?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes, we will.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That might be helpful  just  to  see whatthe  trends are.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We  can certainly look at  the  daily correlations,Mr. Chairman,  to  see how the  bond and the exchange markets  weremoving.  I think  it  is  still  true,  though Charles  Siegman may want  tocomment  on  this,  that over  time  the  dollar  and interest  rates  tend  tomove  together.  But there  is  a lot  of  ceteris paribus behind thattendency, and it  certainly  does not  happen all  the  time  and every day.Certainly, real  interest  rate  differentials might be the  relevantissue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On the  famous Fridays  once  a month, weget  a lot of  evidence of  spikes  in both directions,  and  that might bea useful  laboratory to  see  what happens.

[SECTION]

MR. SIEGMAN.  Don's  comment about  real  interest  rates  isobviously  important.  If  other news  in  the market  is  interpreted in  away that  leads  to  rising  inflationary expectations,  then long-terminterest  rate movements  need not  necessarily affect  the  dollar.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You are  really confirming what  PeterFisher said.  Jerry.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I want  to  turn  to domestic  operations,  Peter.Looking at  the  daily information you reported and your problems  overthis  intermeeting period,  it  seemed to me  that  there were  at  leastthree  significant parts  of  the  story  that were not mutuallyindependent.  But  I could not  tell  from your  reports which was  themost  important part of  the  story  from  the  standpoint  of  thisCommittee.  A part  of  the  story simply seems  to  be what  is  going onwith  sweep accounts  and  reserves,  which created one  type  of  problem.We now have  a survey to  help us  figure  out  the  implications of  the  lowlevel  of  bank balances  in  reserve accounts.  But  I don't  know what  tomake  of  the  other  two parts  of  the  story.  One of  them  is  thereference  to  foreign currency outflows, possibly Russian  demand forU.S.  currency, which reduced  the  supply of  bank reserves.  But  it  alsoseemed at  times  that  there was  something  going on  in  the  domesticeconomy  such  that  the  derived demand  for bank reserves  associated withthe growth of  bank credit was  coming  out  differently than youexpected.  That  is  quite  a different matter.  If  we  failed to8/20/96interpret correctly the demand  for bank  reserves  coming from  theexpansion of  bank credit,  then we would make  the  kind  of mistake thatwas made back  in the  1970s  of misreading underlying  forces.  That  isexactly the  opposite  of a reduced supply  of bank reserves  coming fromforeign demand for  our  currency.  If we  failed to  accommodate  that,that would be  the  opposite type  of mistake.  Do  you have a sense  orfeeling of  the  relative  importance of  those?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Let me try  to  answer  that,  and I invite  Don tojump  in after  I have made  the  first  stab.  Your  three  factors weresweep accounts,  demand  for  currencies  from overseas,  and then  justgeneral  demand for  reserves.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Derived from bank credit growth.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Right.  The nexus  that we have been  looking atis  really  the  first and third  together.  As  sweep accounts  continue  to"sweep" the  nation,  the  level  of  vault  cash that  is  applied to  bankreserves  becomes much more  important.  What we are  observing here  is  aweekly, moving phenomenon, with Friday flows  in and out  for  weekends,and we are  experiencing some  difficulty in tracking  total  requiredreserves  as  vault cash becomes  a larger and larger,  and in  some casesa dominant,  share  of  the  reserves  of  major banks.  So,  I would linkyour  first  and third points.  I do not know if  we have any  sense--Ilook  to both  Sandy Krieger and Don Kohn--that  there are other  sourcesof  demand for  reserves  that are giving us  a problem of  interpretation.We are certainly  focusing on  this  one.  Don, maybe you want  tocomment.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  President  Jordan, with respect  to  the  thirdfactor, I think  the evidence  for  unexpected demands  for money andcredit or  intermediation  services  through  the banks  is  not strong inthis period.  If  anything, money growth in  July came  in  weaker  than wewere  expecting.  While  it  strengthened  in August,  it  is  still  growingalong a very moderate  track.  So  I do not  think we are  seeing asituation  in which we  are having  trouble assessing developments,  otherthan  the problems  that Peter mentioned of  the  week-to-week and day-to-day demands  for  excess  and required reserves.  I do not  think we see  asituation  in which we  are persistently underestimating the  demands  forreserves because money supplies  are  coming  in  stronger and it  looks  asif we are  accommodating a perhaps  inflationary increase  in liquidity.That  is  not  a situation  that  we have  seen,  if  that  is what you meantby your  third point.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  This  week-to-week, day-to-day problem  is  clearlysomething we  are spending a great  deal  of  time  focusing  on.  I thinkthis  episode  reflected a unique confluence  of  events;  everythingconspired  against us  at  the  same  time.  But we  are  still  focusingnonetheless  on how to  track the  week-to-week changes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions  for  Peter?  Ifnot, would  somebody like to  move  to  ratify  the  operations of  theDomestic  Desk?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.8/20/96

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  You may rememberthat  at  our  last meeting, Bill McDonough and  I were sent  on a missionto  the  BIS  to  discuss  the  issue of  swap arrangementsI thought  I would bring the  Committee up todate  on our discussions  and suggest where  I think this  leaves us  interms  of moving  forward on  the  range of  issues we discussed at  ourlast meeting.  I assume  that Bill  will want  to  make  some  remarks  ofhis  own  shortly.Based on  these  conversations,  it  is my view that  we  shouldset  aside  the  issue  of  the  discontinuation  of  the  swap  network  for  themoment.  We  should return to  this matter when  a better opportunitypresents  itself,  such  as  when the  European Central  Bank  is  establishedand we  have  to  decide what  to do  with our  swap  lines  with theparticipating national central  banks whose currency will  soon be  theeuro.  On the  current  timetable, a decision on  stage  three of  EMUwould be  taken no  later  than the  spring of  1998.  If  it  were positive,8/20/96the  European Central Bank would come  into  existence soon  thereafter,although it  would not  start operating  until January  1999.  Thus, wewould return  to  this  issue  in  the  spring or  summer  of  1998.On the  matter of  authorizing the  Desk to  do  reverse RPs withforeign central banks,  our discussion last month revealed that  thereare a number of  aspects  of  this  issue  that  the  Committee  would like  tosee  addressed  in the  context  of  a concrete proposal.  Those  aspectsinclude:  (1) the principles  that  should guide  the Desk  in using  suchauthority;  (2) procedures  that would be  followed  in activating theauthority;  and  (3) whether there  should be a pre-established list  ofcountries with which the  Desk would  stand ready to  operate.  Mysuggestion is  that  the  staff  should develop  a concrete proposal,perhaps with  some  options or  alternatives,  that would address  theseissues and others  that were raised  in  our discussion at  the  FOMCmeeting in July.  My expectation  is  that  the Committee  would be  ableto  consider  the proposal  at our  September meeting or  at  the  latest  in

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I share  the viewthat,  since  the  swap lines  are  essentially anachronistic,  it  wouldhave been better  if  we had had a more receptive  responseBut  certainly yourreport  on  our meetings with them is  absolutely accurate both incontent  and tone.  Since  those  conversations  took place in  July, theatmosphere  of  the  European  foreign exchange markets  and the  future  ofEMU have become a little more  troubled and  troubling.  I think  that  ifwe were  seen  to  be  trying  to  dismantle  the  swap network at  this  ratherdelicate time,  if  that house  of  stone  or house  of cards  should  fall,we  could be deemed responsible, which would not  be  in  our  bestinterest.  So,  I believe  that maintaining silence and assuming thatthe  swap  lines  are harmless  even in  the worst  of  cases  is very much  inour  interest.  Whereas  I was  rather hopeful  at  our  last meeting thatwe  could get  rid of  the  swap  lines,  what  has  happened in the  meantimein addition to  our conversations  indicates  that  this  is  not  the  righttime  to dismantle  them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We have  to  be  careful not  to  allow whatare  essentially financial  anachronisms  to continue  to  embodythemselves  in our  financial  system.  Were  these  swap arrangements  apotentially dangerous or malignant problem, one  could trade  off  theconcerns of not  seem to  be  the problem.  So  long  as  we  pledge ourselves  to  reviewthese  arrangements  and hopefully to dismantle  them in  an appropriatetimeframe, we probably will  have done  about as  much on  this  questionas  I think we can at  this  time.against other  considerations.  But  that does

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I very much agree with  that.  Iwould hope  that the  staff  could do  their work so  that we would be  in aposition  to  discuss the  reverse  repos  in September.  As  I mentioned atthe  last meeting, I think  the  likelihood of  our using a reverse  repocapability would be  very, very low, and we  would make  sure  that  therewere  all  kinds  of protections  against  ill-advised use of  it.  But thefact  that  the  Desk is  not authorized  to  use that  financing  instrumentwith  foreign  central banks  has taken  on  a life  of  its own  that  I thinkis  a bit  of  a problem  for our  relations with  some countries,especially in Asia.  Therefore,  our having  the power even  if  we did8/20/96not  plan  to  use  it,  I think, would serve  our  interests better  than  ourswap  lines  which are  an anachronism.  The  fact  is  that  20  years  agowhen the  Committee  considered the  use of  RPs  with  foreign  officialaccounts, nobody  thought we would need reverse repos,  and  that  is  whythe  Desk does  not have  the  authority to use them.  It  is  not becauseanybody went  through  a thoughtful  exercise and  said,  "this  is  aninappropriate power  for  the Desk  to  have."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There are,  however,  foreign policyconsiderations  involved here.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Exactly, yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Which  I think the  staff  will  address.Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman, I agree  that  this  is  not  the  timeto  dismantle  the  swap  lines, but  I have  a question as  to whether therereally  is  ever going to be  a good time.  The establishment  of  theEuropean Central  Bank  is not  a foregone conclusion, although  the  oddsall  of Europe  is  included, that  does  not do anything for  our Japaneseswap  line.  So,  I am not  sure  that we have  identified an appropriatetime  as  a target date to  get  rid of  these  arrangements.  While  thisthat  there  is  a time when we  think  it  definitely will  be appropriateto  revisit  the issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we will revisit  this  issueduring the  spring of  1998.  At  that point, we may  conclude that  theEMU  is  active,  alive, and the  ECB  is  about  to happen.  Because  so manyof  our swap  lines  are with those  EMU countries, we will  have  a windowto  reshuffle  all our  central bank  financing arrangements.  If  it  doesnot happen  that way, we will have  to  address  this  issue anyway, and  Iwould suspect we may  just decide to  drop  the whole swap  line  networkat  that  time.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Let us  think about what  the  ECB  is  going tolook like  in  1998.  I do not have  the complete  list  of countries  thatwe have  swaps  with, but  I would wager  that  some will be  in  and somewill be  out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  may be,  but  the  ones  that  will bein will provide  an  opportunity  for us  to readdress  the  issue.  We  canuse  that as  the vehicle.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Would it  not be  even more disruptive  if  westarted to  talk about getting  rid of  the  swap  lines  at  a time  when,say, there was  a great  debate as  to whether  France or  Britain met thecriteria--I  am just using that  as  an  example--and we had  some  ofEurope in and  some  of  Europe out  when the decision was made  to  goahead with  the ECB?  We would encounter  all  the  delicacies andramifications  of  European politics  if  we raised  this  issue  then.  Iwould think  that,  if  anything,  that would be an even more  sensitivetime  than  the present.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  conceivable  that you may be right.I doubt  it  myself, but  I think our conversations  with8/20/96-7-

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That  is,  not now?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Not now.It may well  be  that when we  review that  again  in thespring of  1998,  if  that  is  our plan, we will at  that point  concludethat we face  such a mess  that we will  bite  our  tongue,  so  to  speak,and say nothing about  the  issue.  My guess  at  this  stage  is  that theprobabilities  of  the  swap  network disappearing by mid-1998 are well  inexcess  of  50  percent.  If  I have my way--I have  a vote, you have avote--it will be  gone.  But  there  is  obviously more here  than merelythe  question of  financial  arrangements.  Indeed,  the  financialarrangements  would no  longer be  relevant  if  the  issue  inadvertentlyturned  into a diplomatic hassle.  Yes,  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I have  a question and a suggestion also.  Inyour recommendation  that we put  this  aside  for  two years,  could youelaborate  for  us  on Mexico and maybe Canada  too with regard to  thearrangements  that we have with  them?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  the NAFTA arrangements  areessentially  independent  of  this  issue,  and because  they involve adifferent  issue we will  evaluate  them  completely separately from theother  swap lines.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.  Then, concerning what happens  two yearsfrom now,  I know  this  Committee  cannot bind the Committee  two  yearsfrom now, but  in  the past we have been  in  the  situation where  thepresumption was,  it  seems  to  me at  least,  that we would continue  sucharrangements  unless  somebody bore the  burden of persuading  theCommittee  that  it was  the  time  to  end them.  At this point,  I wouldlike  to  have  at  least  a presumption  of  a soft  sunset provision  thatsays  the  swap  arrangements will  be  terminated two  years or  so  from nowunless somebody makes  a compelling argument  that  they  should becontinued.  Such  an understanding would reverse what  I sense is  theenvironment  that we  are in now.  I know  it would not be  binding twoyears  from now, but  it  would help my comfort  level  a great deal  if  thegeneral view of  this  Committee  was that  we  should not renew  the  swaplines  after  two  years.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I certainly do not  want to  take a voteon  this  question.  But if  you are  asking me personally, I agree withyou.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Good.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I was  going  to make basically the  same pointthat Jerry Jordan did, Mr. Chairman.  I understand the  timing problemcurrently, but  I think Larry Lindsey is  right.  It  is  very difficultto  find a convenient  time  to  do  this.  I am concerned that we aregoing  to  continue  to  drift with  this  issue, and  I was  happy to hearyour  response  to  Jerry's question.  Two years  is  a long time  down theroad.  Maybe we  can  take an opportunistic  approach to  this  issue  aswell.  [Laughter]  If  there  is  an  opportunity and circumstances change8/20/96-8-or  it  looks  as  if  we might be  able to  make progress  sooner,  I wouldnot hesitate  to  do  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  conceivable  that  something mayhappen.  The  EMU may break down.  Events may differ from what weexpect.  We all  know the  types  of  changes  that  can occur  in theinternational  financial system, both planned and otherwise,  andcircumstances  could alter  that  system.  All  I am  saying is  that  thisissue will be back on  our agenda no  later than  the  spring of  1998.Any further comments  on  this  issue?  If  not,  let  us move on  to  MikePrell.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Charles  Siegman will  start  us  off  this morning,Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. SIEGMAN.  Thank you.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  had been the  conventional wisdom inthe business  community that  a strike  tends  to be  inflationary in thesense  that  it  creates  an  artificial degree  of  pent-up demand.  Thatdemand gets  unleashed when the  strike terminates  and potentiallyinduces  some  acceleration of  economic  activity that would not  haveoccurred without  the  strike.  Are you aware of  any systematic  analysisof  that hypothesis?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I am not  aware of  any.  Certainly,  in  thisparticular set  of  circumstances, were  there not  to be a major dampingof  underlying demand  trends--and  I do not  see  why that wouldnecessarily occur  from a strike of plausible duration--the  attempt  tomake up  the  lost production to  meet  the pent-up demand  for  autos  wouldpress pretty  hard on  capacity.  The GM  strike  in March, as  we haveseen, created  some  turbulence  in  the  data, and GM had to  pressproduction pretty hard after  the  strike.  In  that  recent period, wedid not  see major price  increases  in the auto  industry.  So,  thebottleneck there  does  not  seem to  have resulted in a lot  ofinflationary pressure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  is  the  earliest  date  that  a strikecan occur?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Our understanding is  it would not  occur beforethe  expiration of  the  contract, which  I believe  is  September  14.  So,we presumably will have  some  information around  the  time  of  the  nextmeeting.  The  strike  target  is,  as  I gather,  to  be announced on August22.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  August  22.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  My memory on  the  subject  of  strikes  is  shortbecause I have  not been coming to  these  meetings  for very  long, but  Iwas  struck by  the number  of  times  the  notion of  a "strike"  appeared asa factor underlying the  analysis  in the Greenbook, particularly  inPart  II.  There were references  to  strikes  that  had just  ended and  tothe potential  for  a strike  in the  auto  industry.  I am wondering8/20/96whether  the principal  effect  of  strikes  is  not  so much their near-termimpact  on economic  activity or  inflation but rather  their  longer-termimpact  on people's perceptions  of  the  relative power of  labor unionsversus management  despite  the  decline of membership  in  labor unions  inthis country.  It's  an  impact  that  is  occurring  in an  environment  inwhich there  seems  to  be a great  deal  of  concern about whether WallStreet,  shareholders,  and management are enriching  themselves  at  theexpense  of workers'  standards  of  living.  So,  I am wondering whether,even  if  a strike  does not  have an  immediate  inflationary impact,  itspotential  to  affect  even nonunion relationships between  labor  andmanagement may be  significant  going forward.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That would depend  on how the  strike  cameout, whether,  for example,  it  was a significant management victory.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes.  But  just  the  fact  that  a strike  occurred,I think,  is  something  that  is--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well,  I wonder.  That  is  not  so  clear tome.  There  have been  significant  strikes  in the  past where evidentunion defeats had a very damping effect  on  labor unions.  For  example,the  flight controllers'  strike, which was  quashed, did more  tosuppress  union power  than almost anything  else  in  the  20th  century.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes,  but  I think  that was  in an environment  inwhich people generally  felt  that unions were detrimental  to  theoverall competitiveness  of  U.S.  industry.  They may still  feel  thatway, but  I think there  is much more  of a feeling now that  the wageearner is  the one  who is  bearing  the brunt  of  efforts  to  improve U.S.competitiveness.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I would just note  that  in  this  auto industrysituation  there also  are peculiarities  that people  will  be focusing onin  terms  of whether  the  union  is  able effectively  to  set a patternafter  they have  negotiated an agreement with  one of  the  auto makers.I think  there  are major questions  about  the mechanics  of  thisnegotiation process with the  three  auto makers.  So,  there will  be  alot  of  grist  for  the analytical mills  that  look at  how labor relationswork.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I want  to  ask Mike  Prell  two  questions.  Butfirst  let  me comment on  what we have heard on  the  strike issue  fromauto  supply companies  and competing  firms  in our area.  Maybe you havebeen hearing  some  similar or perhaps  different  things,  Mike.  Ourcontacts  tell  us  that  for  General Motors,  if  they  decide to  take  astrike,  it  will be a  "no lose"  situation  in  the  sense that  they mustbe victorious  or they will  have  to  break up  the company.  There  is  avery strongly held view among some of  the  firms  in  the  industry  thatfor  General Motors  this  is  a life-and-death  situation because  theircosts  are  so much higher  than Eaton's  and TRW's  and some  of  the  autosupply parts  companies  that they absolutely must get  concessions.  Itreally does  not matter to  them what  Chrysler and Ford get.  GM needssignificant  concessions  to  survive in  this  view.I have  two questions,  Mike,  and  I think they  are  unrelated.The  first  has  to  do with what Charles  Siegman had to  say about the8/20/96-10-second-quarter numbers.  Typically when we get  surprises  and revisionsof numbers  there  is  one  of  these  two  responses:  Either  they carryforward  in the  same direction  or  they produce mirror  image  offsets  inthe  subsequent period.  What  is  your tentative  judgment about  theimplications  for  the  third quarter  and the  second half based on  thefirmer numbers you now have  for  the  second quarter, which aredifferent  in some  respects  from what  you thought  they were going  to beat  the time  of  the May Greenbook?  If  you want me  to,  I will  let  yourespond to  that before  I ask the  second question.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  There  is  little  I can  say at  this point because  Ido  not  really know the details  of  these revised data.  One  obviousimplication  is  that,  if  our estimates  are correct,  we will  havestronger final  sales  and stronger output.  We  also will  get  the  samekind  of  inventory  level  that  we  estimated before, which  suggests  thatinventory positions may be even  leaner relative  to  sales  than we hadanticipated.  Obviously, that might have  some  favorable  implicationsgoing  forward.  Now, we are not  talking  about night and daydifferences, but  we would lean  in that  direction.  We  also want  tolook  for whatever  evidence of  export  trends  there may be  in  thesedata, and we  shall  have  to  make  a careful  assessment  of  that.Charles,  maybe  you know more.

[SECTION]

MR. SIEGMAN.  Again, we  have  few details.  For  example, withrespect  to  the composition of  the  decline of  more  than $2 billion  inimports,  about  one fourth  is  accounted for by automobiles,  andautomobile exports went up a little.  Inventory movements play a rolein  this sector.  We  just do not know how  that will work out.  Importsof  industrial  supplies  also declined  $700  million.  This  is  not  a signof  economic  strength.  Again, we  are  looking at  very preliminaryinformation, but  eyeballing the monthly trade  data  from the beginningof  the  year,  it  now looks  as  if  the  large May import  number may havebeen  the  outlier because  it was  relatively high.  The  number we haveright  now for  June is  similar to  that  for most of  the  other months  ofthe year, but that  again is  the  first impression.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  The  other question, Mike, has  to do  withGreenbook projections  for  the period.  I was  struck by the  increase  innominal  GDP  of  about  .3 percentage point  from  the  last  half  of  thisyear  to  the  end of  1997  with the  same  assumed federal  funds rate.  Inoticed  that  starting with the  fourth quarter of  1994,  your four-  tosix-quarter projections  for nominal  spending associated with anunchanged funds  rate were  remarkably stable.  This  is  the  firstinstance where you raised nominal  spending growth with a given  fundsrate.  I tried to  find in  the Greenbook or  in your briefing thismorning why you now expect, given an unchanged  funds  rate, spendinggrowth  to  be  more rapid for  the  next year and  a half.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  This nominal  GDP change  is  so  small  that  it  isgoing to  be very hard  to pin down all  the  factors  that  go  into  it  fromdifferent  directions.  I don't  think there  is  a major  story herebecause, as  I have said before,  we do not  approach the  forecast  interms  of  taking  interest  rate  assumptions  and  from  that  drawingdirectly a forecast  of  nominal  GDP.  It  is  a complex process.  Therehas  been a reassessment  of  some  of  the price series  and relationshipsthat have  crept  into  the analysis.  We do  have  a situation where wehave  a bit more  inflationary pressure because of  (1) a lower  startingpoint  for  the  unemployment rate,  (2) the minimum wage hike,  and  (3) we8/20/96-11-are  impressed by  the wage  data  in  the  first  half  of  the year  that  aretending  to push us  to  a forecast  that has  a little more of  aninflationary cast.  Given the  nominal  funds  rate,  we have  a littlemore  inflation and  a monetary policy that  is  a little moreaccommodative  as  measured by real  interest rates.  If  you put  thesethings  together,  they  end up  producing a nominal GDP path  that  is  alittle higher  even with  essentially the  same real path.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I have  thought about  that  linkage, but  theproblem with  that  response is  that  I cannot  convince myself  that  it  isnot  circular.  If  you assume that  we have  had an  inflation surprise,for whatever reasons,  and you now  think  inflation could be higher  thanyou previously thought--and as  a result real  interest  rates would belower  than you previously  thought--that  does  not necessarily lead tohigher nominal  spending growth.  In  my framework, that  means we  couldhave higher velocity growth,  and I do not  see  that happening from thisdynamic  of  higher  inflation and  lower real  interest  rates.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We have a monetary accommodation implicit  in  ourforecast.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Then you are  saying  faster money growth.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  let  the  money stock be whatever it will  be.Whether it  actually comes  out  faster  in our  forecast  is  also  afunction of  how the  recent  developments  have  influenced our views  ofthe money demand relationship.  We do not  have  faster money  stockgrowth in this  forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That  is based primarily on the  observation  thatthe  incoming money growth data  are a little weaker  than we hadanticipated.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  You have  to  have a budget constraint  and centralbank money in your  framework,  so you are  telling me  that velocitygrowth is  going to  be higher.  I don't  see  how that  follows  from  thislinkage.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  What we assume  is  that monetary growth willaccommodate  the maintenance  of  a nominal  funds  rate  in the  face of  thegrowth of  aggregate  demand.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The way we go  about  this  is  entirely endogenous.As you know, a nominal  interest rate,  particularly one  that  is  theCommittee's  target,  is  not  a nominal  anchor.  I think that  the processthat Mike described  is  exactly what  went  on.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  revisions  in the  Greenbook  forecastsprepared for  recent meetings have  been quite  small.  But  I think theyhave  been  in  the  direction  of  raising  the rate  of  inflation and  tosome  extent,  I guess,  the  level  of  real  GDP.  In  light of  that,  couldyou comment on  the  likelihood  that  the  slowdown during the  forecastperiod will be  enough to  relieve  inflationary pressures?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We do not  think  there  is  enough of  a slowdown  inour  forecast  to  relieve  inflationary pressures.  Basically, what we8/20/96-12-see  is  that  the  evidence  on wage behavior  in  the  first  half  of  thisyear  supports  the view that we are  operating at  a level  of  resourceutilization that  is  incompatible with maintenance of  a steady rate  ofinflation  in the  economy.  We  are not  in  such tight  conditions,particularly looking  at  the  capacity utilization side  of  the  pictureas well  as  the  labor market  side,  that we would anticipate,  absentexternal  shocks,  a very rapid pickup  in  inflation.  But we  wouldexpect  some gradual  updrift.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  The  change  in the  forecast  in the  last  couple  ofmeetings  and some  of  the  comments  in  Part  I of  the  Greenbook, which  Imust admit  I found  striking, seem  to  suggest  that you see  theprospects of  a more  favorable  outcome  as probably lower now than  youdid at  the  time  of  the previous meeting  or  the  meeting before  that.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think our  confidence in  our assessment of  theimplications  of  this  level  of  resource utilization has  grown with thelatest wage  figures.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I see.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Just  getting back to  the  potential  for  a strike,someone  in  the auto  industry described this period to  me as  the  calmbefore  the  storm since nothing really happens  until  later  this weekwhen a target  is  selected.  The  key issue,  of  course,  is  outsourcingfor General Motors.  They manufacture  a lot  more parts themselves,  aswe all  know, and they need to  get more  flexibility in  outsourcingthese  parts.  Of  course,  the  selection  of  the  target  is  importantbecause  if  GM  is  not  selected, Chrysler will  be.  Chrysler could agreeto  some provisions  that would not  hurt Chrysler but would hurt  GM  interms  of  this  outsourcing issue because  Chrysler does  so muchoutsourcing.  Compensation  increases do not  appear  to  be an  issuehere.  The unions  already have  a cost-of-living escalator  in  theiragreements;  no one  is  really  talking about  changing that.  They haveprofit  sharing already.  The profit  sharing agreement  for  Chryslerworkers has paid them very high benefits recently.  Of  course,  thelast  time  they negotiated, they won  a lump  sum payment and there  is  ahigh probability they will  get  that  again.  But  that  does  not go  intothe base  of  the  compensation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Mike,  I agree with  your characterization  of  theproductivity data,  but  I think the business  community would take  sharpexception  to  it.  Everywhere  I go  they talk about the  tremendousproductivity  improvements  that  they  are achieving.  I must  say  that  Iam increasingly uncomfortable about  our ability  to  reconcile  the  twosources  of  information.  I wonder  if  you have  given  that  some  furtherthought  and have  any new information?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I've  observed what you well  know, that  the  datacertainly are  supportive of  the notion  that  there  has been  in the  pastcouple of  years  a continued  quite rapid improvement  in productivity  inmanufacturing.  We  get  reports  from business executives  that  they  canproduce  as  many widgets  now as  they did a few years  ago with twice  asmany workers  then.  I think the  data are not  completely inconsistent8/20/96-13-with  the  reports we get anecdotally  from the  manufacturing sector.  Insome  of  the nonmanufacturing sectors,  we get  into  the  difficultproblem  of measuring the  output,  and it  is  conceivable  that  outputgrowth is  being underestimated.  The  only caveat in  this  regard isthat,  when we  look on  an  aggregate  level  at what  has been happening  tooutput  and what  has been  happening to  unemployment,  the  relationshiphas  held up reasonably well.  We had some veering  off  seemingly  in1995,  but we  now seem to  be pretty much back  on  track with  that basicOkun's  law relation.  Ultimately, we  think that  is  of  criticalimportance because  it  tells  us where  resource utilization  levels areheaded for  given measured levels of  output  growth.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are  there  any  further questions  forMike?  If  not, would  somebody like  to  start  the  Committee  discussion?President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the  economy in  the  Kansas CityDistrict,  like other parts  of  the nation,  has  slowed,  in our casefrom a very strong  to  a still  strong rate  of  growth;  it  just is  not asstrong as  it was  a few months ago.  Our  directors  confirm the positivetone  in  the region's  economy, with many reporting healthy gains  inbusinesses  throughout  the  District.  The rail  transportation industry,for  instance,  is  reporting  solid gains  in rail  traffic,  and  operationsare at  full  capacity right now.  The  signs  that  regional  growth hasslowed through the  summer  include  indications  in our  latestmanufacturing  survey of  slower  growth in output  than  in  our previoussurvey last  spring.  Construction contracts  and housing permits,consistent with data  for other parts  of  the  country, also  have shownsome  easing, but  it has  to be  emphasized that  the  easing has been  fromvery high rates.  On  the  agricultural  side,  grain producers  continueto  do  very well  at  currently high prices while the  cattle  industry isstill  suffering  somewhat.  Our  labor markets  continue to  be  tight.Reports  of  wage pressures, while  still  sporadic,  are becoming morefrequent  now, and we are  seeing some  efforts  to  address  thosepressures  through  improved benefits.  So,  I think  inflation prospectsare worsening  somewhat  in  our regional  economy.On the national  economy, we  continue  to  see  an  outlook forgrowth along  the  lines  reported in  the Greenbook.  I do not  see  a lotof  differences  in our projections  and  those in  the Greenbook.  Weagree with  the Greenbook that,  even  if  the  expansion slows  somewhat,the  rate of  inflation will  register  a very modest  1/4  point  increasethis  year  and maybe another  1/4 point  next year,  all  other things heldconstant.  I think that  is  the  outlook we have  to  deal with here  todayor  in the next  few meetings.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Beigebooksummary this  time  starts off  with a statement  that  the  nationaleconomy continued  to  expand  in June  and July, but  it points  out  thatthere was  some  slowing in  some areas  and in  some  sectors.  I thinkthat characterization describes  reasonably well what  is  going  on  inour  region.  There  are  signs  of  slower  growth in  some  sectors  over  thelast  month or so.  For example,  the  growth of  consumer outlays  fordurable  goods other  than automobiles  appears  to  have decelerated a8/20/96-14-bit,  and there  is  some evidence  from  one of  our  regular monthlysurveys  that  the pace  of  manufacturing activity is  a little  softerthan  it was  earlier.  But  I would emphasize  that  this moderation ingrowth  is  still  a pretty tentative  development  at  this point.  Atleast  in our region,  it  may reflect  in part the  unusually wet  summerwe have had.  At  this  point,  it  is  not  at  all  clear  how long  thistrend will  persist,  if  it  persists at  all.  Moreover,  I would make  thepoint  that  it  is  a moderation  from a very robust rate  of  expansion inthe  second quarter,  as  I know was  the  case  in many other  regions  ofthe  country.  Overall,  most  of  the  comments  we hear  from our directorsand other business  contacts  are  still  mainly upbeat.  They suggestthat  District  business activity has  settled into  a groove  at  a veryhigh  level  of  activity even  if  there has been  some deceleration  in  therate  of  growth recently.  There  are  still pockets  of very robustactivity in certain parts and sectors  of  the  District.  For example,on  the  commercial  real  estate  side,  the market  for  Class  A officespace  is  very tight  here  in  the Washington metropolitan  area.Whatever may be  happening  to  housing nationally, residentialconstruction  is  really booming  in West Virginia and there  are  a coupleof very large  resort  and hotel projects under way in  that  state.Again, the  bottom  line  is  some moderation  in  the  rate  of  growth  in  theDistrict, but  the  level  of  activity is  still  very high.I emphasize  this  point about  the level  of  District activitybecause  that,  it  seems  to me,  is  where our  focus  ought  to  be  inlooking  at  the national picture  this morning.  Given  the  greater-than-expected growth of  the  economy in  the  first  half,  it  seems  to me  thatthe  level  of  activity nationally  is  really quite  high.  It  isreflected in  a number  of  ways,  of  course, but  it  is  especiallyapparent  in the  tightness  of  labor markets and  the  recent behavior  ofwages.  Consequently, even  if  the  growth of  aggregate  demandfirst  paragraph of  the  Greenbook and Mike  Prell  has  repeated againthis  morning, the  pressure on resources  is  still  likely to push thetrend  rate of  inflation up  a bit, perhaps  to  above  3 percent over  theprojection period.To me,  that  is  the  central  feature in  the  economic  outlookthat we  really need  to  focus  on most  closely at  this juncture.  If  weget  an  outcome  like  that,  it will be  inconsistent  with our publiccommitment  to  hold the  line  on  inflation.  Moreover, as  I understoodthe  discussion  that we had at  the  last meeting about our  longer-termprice  objective, while  there was  some disagreement  around  the  table  asto whether we should try  to  push the  trend  inflation rate  below 2percent,  there was  general  agreement  that we  ought  to  move  in  thatdirection, and this  projection  is  saying  that  inflation  is  going to bemoving  in  the  opposite direction.  It  is  true,  of  course,  that  thelatest  incoming data  suggest that  the  economy may be  slowing  somewhatfrom  the  second-quarter pace.  In particular, as  we  all  know,employment  grew more  slowly in July, but as  was mentioned thismorning, there  certainly  are signs  of  strength in  some  of  the  data.Initial claims  are  at  a very low level  in recent  weeks,  as Mikepointed out.  The Greenbook is  projecting a third-quarter gain inaggregate hours  at a 2 percent  rate.  That's lower  than  the  second-quarter pace  but  it's  still  above  trend, which means that  laborturn  could foster greater job  security, and  that raises  some  questionsabout  the  extent  and duration of  the  current  softening  in consumer8/20/96-15-spending.  But  whatever the  outlook may be  and whatever the  debate maybe  about  that  outlook, the main point seems  to  me to  be that  even  ifwe do  get a fairly sustained  and marked deceleration in  growth, westill  have  an  inflation risk  that we need to  be aware  of  and come  togrips with.One final  comment  about wages:  I think we ought  to  be quiteconcerned about  the  first-half  pickup  in the  ECI.  One  can  interpretthat pickup  in  several ways.  I am  inclined to  interpret  it  as  afairly straightforward bit  of  additional  evidence  that  underlyinginflation pressures  may be increasing  at  least  to  some  extent.Obviously, an  increase  in wages  is  not  inflationary if  productivity  isrising.  Like  Gary Stern,  I hear  a lot  of  anecdotal  comments  thatsuggest productivity may be  rising, but  it  seems  to me  that we do  notyet  have any really compelling evidence that  the  trend rate  ofproductivity is  rising.  I guess  it  is  also possible,  along  the  linesof  the  argument  in Governor Yellen's paper  that was distributed at  thelast meeting, that  the  increase in  the  ECI  reflects  a correspondingincrease  in the  equilibrium real  wage, perhaps  because workers aremore  secure in  their jobs now than they were before.  If  that  ishappening, then obviously that  would not  be inflationary in and ofitself.  But  in  my view it  would still  constitute an  inflation risksince  firms will  try at  some point  to  push those wage  increasesthrough  to  higher prices  if  they can  get away with  it.  They willrefrain  from doing  so  only  if  they are  forced ultimately  to  absorb  theincreases.  For my money, that  is  where  the  Fed and its  credibilitycome  in.  I think we need to  insure  that  our policy stance willmaintain a pricing  environment  that  is  hostile  to  such pass-throughs.I think we need to  send  the  same message  that  a famous  resident  in BobParry's District,  Clint Eastwood, used to send,  "don't even  thinkabout it." [Laughter]  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  That  is  a hard act  to  follow!  [Laughter]  TheSeventh District economy  is  still  operating  at  very high  levels, butit  is  expanding  at a slower pace  than  in  the  first  half  of  the year.Housing starts  and permits  increased  rather sharply  in  the Midwest  inin  June.  Manufacturing activity in  the  District  continues  to  bestrong and  light  vehicle production reached an expansion  high  in July.Growth  in consumer spending  slowed considerably in July, butinformation  from retailers points  to  some pickup  in early August.  Oneof  our directors  said  the  Olympics had a very real retarding effect  onretail  sales,  especially during  the  first  week.  He  indicated  thatsales have picked up  since  the  Olympics  ended, though  the  tempo  isdown from  earlier this  year.  While reports were mixed, otherretailers generally noted some  sales  improvement since  July.  Reportedauto and light  truck  sales  for  July were  down sharply  from June,  butfor  light  vehicles  for reasons  that were  discussed in the  Greenbook.So  far  in August,  our  reports  suggest that  sales  have moved up  to  the14.8  to  15  million unit  range,  assuming no  special  factors willdistort  the  numbers  this  month.  This  is  consistent with  the modestslowing  in  sales  that we have been expecting  for  the  second half  of1996.8/20/96-16-On employment  conditions more generally, the  news  is  thesame.  Labor markets remain  tight  in  the  Seventh District  and wecontinue to  experience unemployment  rates  below the  national average.Future hiring  plans seem robust.  We have  an  advance  copy ofManpower's  latest national  survey, which will not be  publicly releaseduntil  next Monday, August 26,  that  shows  stronger fourth-quarterhiring plans  relative to  a year ago.  The strength  is  fairlywidespread across  industries and across  regions of  the nation.  Thesurvey indicates  the  best  holiday job gains  seen  in  13  years  forwholesale  and retail  employment.  Recent  reports  from our  contactscontinue to  show an uptick  in wage  rates.  Wages  in  the  paper industryare up  2-1/2  to  3 percent  this  year  compared to 2 to  2-1/2  percentlast  year.  Wage  settlements  in the  steel  industry are under  3percent, but  these  replace contracts  with no  wage  increases  at  all.As  discussed  in the  Greenbook,  the  upcoming  increase  in the minimumwage will  affect  entry-level and near  entry-level wages.  TheGreenbook  analysis assumes that  hourly workers  earning over  $6 an hourwill not be  affected.  However,  one major  retailer indicated  thattheir employees  with wages  of  $8.50  an hour  would be receiving wageincreases as  a result  of  the minimum wage hike.  So  I think theGreenbook  is  understating the  impact  for those  employees  earning over$6 an hour.More  generally, on  the price  front most  reports  stillindicate  that  inflationary pressures are  contained, but we have  hadsome  scattered reports  of more rapidly rising prices.  In  agriculture,this  year's harvest  may not  significantly ease  the  tight  supplies  ingrain markets, but very high grain prices  are  cutting demand fromabroad and from  domestic users.  The  related cuts  in  livestock, milk,and poultry production will  extend the  recent upward pressure onretail  food prices well  into  next  year.Turning  to  the  national  outlook, our  assessment is  similar  tothe Greenbook's  with economic growth  over  the next  year and a halfreturning  to  a pace near the  growth  in potential  output.  We expectreal  GDP growth  in  the  second half  of  1996  to  be  in  the  range  of  2-1/4to  2-1/2  percent.  But  even  this  moderation  in growth will  likelyleave  the  economy's  resource utilization  at  a rate high  enough  toincrease  inflation, as  Mike Prell  and Al  Broaddus mentioned  in  thediscussion.  In  other words, aggregate  demand will  exceed potentialoutput.  We  are  already beginning  to  see  some of  these  resourcestrains  reflected in  recent  compensation data.  In  addition  to  theanecdotal  reports  that  I mentioned,  second-quarter ECI  data  suggestrising  wage and  cost pressures,  and  I am concerned  that  the  recentlyfavorable  trends  in  benefit  costs will not  be  sustained and thatgrowth  in  total  compensation will  increase  even  further.  As  wediscussed  last  time,  the  risks  to  inflation  are  on  the  up  side.  Ithink the  information  that  has become available  since  our  last meetingsuggests  that  these  risks  remain on  the  up  side and may even beslightly higher  than  they were  six weeks  ago.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  economic growth is  strong  in  theTwelfth District.  In  California,  job growth picked up noticeably  inthe  second quarter, and  the unemployment  rate  fell  about  1/2percentage  point.  In July,  the  California unemployment rate  edgeddown further,  and payroll  jobs  continued  to  expand  at  about  the8/20/96-17-second-quarter pace.  Economic  activity in  the  State  of Washingtonalso  is  picking up as  aircraft production  rebounds and the  softwarebusiness continues  to  be  good.  Job growth has  continued to  bestrongest in Nevada, Utah, and  Idaho.  In  the  second quarter,employment  growth  in  these  three  states was about  7 percent at  anannual  rate,  twice  as  fast  as  the  accelerated 3-1/2  percent  second-quarter pace  for  the  nation.  Employment  growth  in Oregon and Arizonahas continued  in  the  3 to  4 percent  range, and we  even have seen  someimprovement in  our  laggard  state, Hawaii,  where economic  conditionswere  deteriorating until  recently.For  the national  economy, the  recent news  is  consistent withour  forecast of  a moderate slowdown  in real  output and employmentduring  the  second half  of  this  year.  Thereafter, we  expect  realgrowth  to  stabilize at  around 2 percent  in  1997,  although ourprojection is  predicated on  a slight  tightening  of  policy over  theforecast  horizon.  However,  the  recent news  is  also consistent withour  general assessment  that  the  economy faces  an  acceleration of wageand price pressures.  We  have reached levels  of  labor and capacityutilization  that are  inconsistent with steady  inflation.  Indeed, weanticipate an  acceleration of  inflation  in  1997  on  the  order of  1/4  to1/2  percentage point in  a wide variety of  price and compensationmeasures.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, while  the  economy may be  slowingsomewhat nationally,  that  is  a bit hard  to  see  in New England rightnow.  Job growth  is  steady, unemployment  rates  in  the  region are  low--a full  percentage point below the nation--and pressures  in  the  jobsome cases  even clerical  workers.  Wage  increases are picking up, withincreases  of  at  least  3 percent  the  norm, and reports  of up to  5percent  are not uncommon.  However, inflation  concerns  remain low withthe  expectation that  wage increases  will be  offset by productivityincreases.  Manufacturing conditions  have  improved.  While  jobs  inthis  sector  continue  to  decline, New England's  rate  of  decline  is  nowestimates,  the manufacturing job picture is  better now than  it  hasbeen since  the  late  1980s.  Our  contacts  in  the manufacturing  sectorare upbeat  overall,  with  areas  of  particular  strength noted in medicalsupplies,  furniture,  and  construction-related products.  Constructionjobs  also have  grown at  a good clip,  in part  reflecting an  increasedpace of  activity in  the  construction of  Boston's Central  Arteryproject, which in nominal  dollars  is  the  most  expensive highwayproject  ever undertaken in  this  country.  Residential  construction haspicked up  as  well.  At  least  in  the western  suburbs of  Boston, much  ofthis  construction  involves very high-end, high-priced single-familyhomes.  The commercial  real  estate markets  are vibrant in  many areas.There has  been virtually no new construction,  and with growingeconomic  activity,  conditions  are  markedly improved,  especially inBoston.  This  is  true  also  in Portland, Maine  and in  suburban RhodeIsland as  well  as  in a number of  other suburban  locations  around theDistrict.  Retailing  remains highly  competitive with disappointingresults  for many.  Tourism has been very strong, with a major influxof  foreign visitors.8/20/96-18-District  loan  growth, as  reflected in  the  data that  we getfrom  five  large  banks  that  report monthly, continues  to  decline as  ithas  throughout  1996.  However,  this  trend largely reflects  the  balancesheet restructuring  that has been going on  at  Fleet  since  the Shawmutand  the Nat West mergers.  Officials  at  Fleet have  indicated thattheir balance  sheet  adjustments  are over.  Loan data for  the Districtas  a whole, which tends  to  be heavily dominated by three  or  fourinstitutions, may soon  start  to  reflect  trends  associated witheconomic  rather than  acquisition  activity.Turning to  the national  scene, we  agree with the  Greenbook'sassessment that  the  expansion  will  slow, possibly to  potential,through  the  rest  of  the year.  We  also  agree  that  the  sources  of  theslowdown  lie  in  domestic demand, especially  in  the  interest-sensitivesectors  of  residential  construction,  consumer durables,  and businessfixed  investment.  We  are not  quite  as  optimistic  as  we usually  areabout the  sources  of  foreign growth  that  are  shown  in the  Greenbook.We wonder, however, whether there  isn't  a certain amount of  risk, andI think Mike addressed  this,  that  GDP growth will  be  stronger than  isreflected in  the Greenbook in  light  of  the  recent declines in  long-term interest  rates, manageable  levels  of business debt,  recentmoderation in  the  growth of  consumer debt,  the unknowable  effects  ofan inventory bounceback that may be  even larger  than  is  anticipated inthe  Greenbook, and  the  continuation of  rather buoyant  equity markets.Moreover,  the  risks  that wage cost  increases will push overallinflation higher  seem even greater  than  the risks  that  GDP growth willbe  greater than we  expect.  Given the  overall  credibility of  theGreenbook forecast,  we  find possible  and certainly credible  theassumption  that price  increases  will be  moderated by productivityimprovements at  this  point  in  the  business cycle or  by shrinkingprofit margins,  but we wonder whether  there isn't  a good deal  of riskin  this  area.  Thus,  we believe  the  inflation situation  as  measured bythe  core  CPI  is  likely  to be  marginally worse than  is  forecast  in  theGreenbook if  no  adjustments  are made  to  policy.

MR. BOEHNE.  The economy in  the  Philadelphia District  appearsto be on  a modest uptrend  that  has  tilted down from a somewhat  fasterpace earlier  in  the  year.  Manufacturing  is  growing but  at  a somewhatslower pace.  Delivery  times,  while  lengthening in  the  spring,  haveshortened more  recently.  Retail  sales  growth, quite  healthy in  thespring,  has  eased during  the  summer  months.  Nonresidentialconstruction is  flat  and the  pickup  in residential  constructionappears  to be  decelerating.  Employment  growth  is  improving  slightlyand  some  labor markets  are  tight while  others  still  have  slack.  Priceand wage pressures  on  the whole  still  seem to  be  reasonably containedin  the District.Turning  to  the  nation,  at  the  last meeting  in  early July wehoped  that more  information  would help  settle  two  questions--whethergrowth would moderate  to  a more  sustainable pace  and whether wageinflation  indeed  is  beginning  to  accelerate.  On  the  sustainablegrowth question,  I think the bottom line  is  that  the  weight  of  thedata suggests  a moderating growth trend but  how much moderation  is  farfrom clear.  On  the wage  question,  the  larger  first-quarter gain wasrepeated  in  the  second.  Once  again, however,  sizable wage  gains wereoffset  by a small  rise  in benefit  costs  so  that  total  compensation has8/20/96-19-been rising at  essentially the  same  rate  in  1996  as  in  1995.  On  thewhole, price pressures  remain remarkably subdued for  this  stage  of  anexpansion.  Reasonable people  can easily come  to  different  conclusionsabout  the  outlook at  this point.  My hunch is  that we may seeappreciable  slowing in  growth because  of  subdued personal consumption,more modest growth  in business  fixed  investment,  and some  slackeningin residential  construction.  At  the  same  time,  upward wage pressureswill  not  likely bubble up  into upward price pressures  as much  as  onemight  think because  of  continuing offsetting smaller benefit  costs  andstrong competition  for products and services.  Nonetheless,  in  thisenvironment  I think we need to  continue  to  monitor demand and pricepressures  very closely.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  economy of  theAtlanta  District  remains moderately strong.  The big news  over  thelast  six weeks,  to no  one's surprise  I'm sure, has been  the  impact  ofthe  Olympics.  Some businesses in Atlanta and other Southeasterncities  were somewhat  disappointed by  the  spillover  effects.  Ingeneral,  the  level  of  spending during the  Olympics was  in  line withexpectations  of  about  $4 to  $6 billion  spread  over  six years.  Whilethat  spending was  a nice bonus for  our region  and it  left behind somereally desirable  infrastructure  that will be  lasting  in  its  impact,  itwas  really small potatoes when  compared with  just  the  Georgia  economywhich generates over  $160  billion  in  income per year.District  residential  real  estate markets generally can becharacterized  as  healthy though activity is  now slowing after a one-year growth spurt.  Multifamily and commercial  real  estate marketsremain strong.  I mention  that because  continuing growth  in each  ofthese markets  at both  the  regional  and national  levels bodes well  forthe  Southeast manufacturing sector, where the  production ofconstruction materials  and durables  is  significant.  While  theforecast  for  durables production remains  fairly good, our region'simportant apparel  industry continues  to  hemorrhage.  In  the  secondquarter, year-over-year  job losses  totaled 42,000  for  the  combinedapparel and  textile industries.  While  the  goods-producing  sectors  areexpected to produce  some  new jobs  over  the  last  half  of  1996,  as  willbe  the  case nationally, the majority of  the new employment  positionswill  likely come  from retail  trade  and  services.  The pockets  of  laborshortages  and related wage pressures  that have continued  to bereported in parts  of  Georgia and Tennessee  should be alleviatedsomewhat by  the  tens  of  thousands  of  individuals previously committedto  Olympics-related construction and  services.  As  those  people seekalternative  employment  opportunities, which  clearly exist  in  theDistrict, we  think we should have  a smooth and rapid transition  intothe  post-Olympics period.My outlook for  the national  economy has not  changedmaterially since  our  last  meeting.  While the  economy  seems  to berunning with  little  slack  in  the  labor markets,  as  evidenced by thelow unemployment rate  and relatively high participation rate,productivity  seems  to  be  high when we  take  account  of  anecdotalinformation.  Hence,  any wage pressures  can reasonably be  viewed asreflecting those  productivity gains  rather than  an  inflationary  threatthat necessarily will  be passed on  to prices.  At the  same time  thereare  signs  of  the  deceleration in activity that  we have been8/20/96-20-forecasting, although  they may be  preliminary at  best.  Manyfundamentals point  to  slowing  investment  and there are  signs  that  thepredicted slowdown  in housing  is  finally being realized.  The earlierbuoyancy in  consumer spending seems  to  be moderating  and the savingrate  is  edging up,  at  least marginally.  I have  to admit  thatinventories  are  lean  and consequently  to the  extent my expectationsfor  slowing  in demand growth are  disappointed, we will  likely  see  animmediate  impact  on  domestic production.  All  things considered,  Istill  think we are  in  an  enviable position with no major  imbalances.Real GDP growth will,  I expect,  average  a little  over 2 percent  thisyear  and probably under 2-1/2  percent  next year,  and this  is  with thebroader-based measures of  inflation  continuing in my view under  3percent.  As  at  our last  discussion,  I'm unconvinced  that  our policystance  currently  is  tending  to make  inflation worse.  So,  thefavorable  news  on  employment and output  is  less  worrisome to me  thanit  might be  otherwise.  My  inflation forecast  continues  to  show noacceleration  for  1996  once  we take  account  of  the effect  of  earlieroil  price increases,  which seem  to  be playing out as  we had expected.Unlike  the Greenbook, when we examine  the  likely effects  of  theminimum wage  legislation, we  see no  serious  impact  on  inflationexpectations when we  take account  of  recent evidence of  thesubstitution of  capital  for  labor,  productivity gains,  competition,and  job restructuring.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. MCTEER.  The  economy in  the  Eleventh District hasremained on  a firm  uptrend throughout  the  summer.  Conversations withour directors  and other  contacts  suggest continuation of more  of  thesame,  with some minor  slowing during  the  remainder  of  the  year.  Thereare  two  and possibly three  areas  of  weakness  in  the District economy.First,  the  drought  is  still  a factor, but  overall  it's not  exerting amaterial  impact  on  the  regional  economy.  The semiconductor  industryhas  continued to  weaken  since  the  last  FOMC meeting;  unit  orders  forsemiconductors  continue  to  fall.  Some  types  like microprocessors  anddigital  signal processors  have been  in strong demand, but  this  has notbeen  sufficient  to  overcome  the weak demand  for memory chips.  SeveralTexas  semiconductor firms  have announced  layoffs  or hiring  freezes,with  the  result  that employment  at  firms  manufacturing electronicequipment  fell  at  a 6 percent  annual  rate  in June.  This  industryrepresents  about  12  percent  of  Texas manufacturing employment  and1-1/2  percent of  Texas nonagricultural  employment.  Construction  ofsingle-family housing  is  still  strong but most builders  and realestate contacts  expect a noticeable  slowing  in the  coming months  asthe  impact  of  higher mortgage rates begins  to  take hold.Several  sectors  of  the  District  economy have  continued  toimprove.  Improvements  in  the Mexican  economy have  spurred retailsales  gains  along the  border,  and we hear that  affluent  Mexicanshoppers  are back  in  large  numbers  in  the  Houston Galleria area.  Theenergy sector continues  to  expand, with every  available  rig in  theGulf  of  Mexico  reported to  be under contract.  The  anticipatedsoftening  of  housing construction may be  a good thing because  it  willfree up  badly needed resources  for  the  construction of  industrialwarehouse  space,  commercial  real  estate,  and maybe a year  from now arebirth  of  office building construction, which has been  almost  dormantin  our area  for  a decade.  Vacancy rates in  suburban markets havefallen  considerably in  the  last year  or  so,  and office  rents  are8/20/96-21-beginning to  reflect  the  shortages  of  available  space.  A similarchurning  in resource allocation  is  occurring in  electronicsmanufacturing.  Falling chip prices  have helped Texas  computingmanufacturers.  Advances  in  technology are beginning  to  reduce  thedemand for  paging devices  and to boost  that  for personalcommunications  services  devices.  This  has  shifted the  demand  for  awide range  of  workers  to  businesses located only  a few miles  away.Overall,  the  national  economy seems  to  be performing  quitewell.  I agree with  the broad outlines  of  the  Greenbook  forecast.  Therate  of  economic growth will  likely slow somewhat  in the  months  ahead,but  inflationary pressures  could begin  to  accelerate,  although  I don'tthink that  is  guaranteed.On the  question of  the  inflation  outlook,  it  is  somewhatsurprising to  me  to  see  all  the  emphasis  that people  in  this  roomplace on wage-push  inflation, which  I recall  learning  in  school wasdependent  on  an  accommodative monetary policy.  The  first  line  ofdefense  is productivity  improvements  and the  second is  ClintEastwood's  "don't even think about  it"  monetary restraint.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  Tight  labor  markets  continue  tobe  the  rule  in  the Eighth District.  The District unemployment ratewas  less  than  5 percent  in both  the  first  and  second quarters,  thelowest  since  the  1970s.  The  strike of  6,700 McDonnell  Douglasmachinists  that began June  5 remains  unsettled.  The company hasmaintained output  so  far with  replacement workers.  Anecdotal  evidencein  a survey of  more  than  200  District enterprises  indicates quitepersistent wage pressures.  About  one-fifth of  the  firms  surveyed areplanning to  increase prices  in  the  third quarter  and  few are planningcuts.  District  automotive output  is  expected to  jump appreciably  inthe  fourth  quarter, although much  of  this  increase  reflects  the boostthat  is  normally associated with the  introduction of  new models.Because  of  strong demand  for models produced  in  the  Eighth Districtand  increased capacity this  year, the  number of  cars  and light  trucksbuilt  in  the  District  by Ford and Chrysler  is  expected to  be  22percent higher this  year  than  last year.Although the  District  economy is  operating at  a high  level,  avariety of  indicators  suggests  that  growth  is  moderating, which is  apicture that we  have heard described by a number  of people  around thetable.  For example,  year-to-date growth  in District  payrollemployment  lags  behind  last  year's pace.  An exception  is  residentialconstruction where employment  continues  to  grow at  a vigorous  rate  andpermits  are  well  above year-earlier levels.  Loan  growth at  Districtbanks  has decelerated  from  the high  rates observed last year, matchingthe national pattern.  The most  recent  Senior Loan Officer  Surveysuggests  that  the  slowdown may be  partly due to  a tightening oflending  standards.  On  the  ag  side,  crops are  in  fairly good conditionacross  the  District.  The rice  crop  is  down from a year earlierbecause  land has  been diverted to  other  crops.  Overall,  harvests  areexpected to be  larger than  last year, though down  from the  records  oftwo years  ago.  Nonetheless,  District  farm  income  should  increasesubstantially this  year because  low inventories  are  holding up  pricesand  federal  outlays  for  farm  income and  price  support programs will  behigher  over  the next  few years under  the new farm bill.8/20/96-22-At  the  beginning of  the year,  the  Committee  took out  aninsurance policy against  the risk of  a slowing economy.  As  eventshave unfolded, the  outlook is  much better  today than  it  was  then.Most  forecasters  see  real  growth holding  close to  the  long-term trendthrough  1997.  In July, the  Committee's  central  tendency forecast  forreal  GDP was  a full  half-percentage point  above the  estimates  that wepresented  in January.  Because real  growth  in the  second quarter wasabove  trend,  forecasters naturally expect  some  slowing.  Earlierfigures  on  retail sales  and  factory  orders  for July confirm  that view.There  also was a decline  in  job growth  in July and a decline  in  theindex  of  hours worked.  It  is  worth noting, however, that  193,000 newjobs  in July,  though down  from  the  figures  for  earlier  months,  arestill  well  above  the growth of  the  working age population of  about110,000  to  120,000  a month.  All  said, the  real  economy seems  to  be  ingood shape  entering the  sixth year  of  the  expansion.Whatever the  outlook may be  for  the real  economy, we must  beconcerned about  the  rising inflation  trend.  This  rising  trend can beseen  in the  staff's projections.  CPI  inflation touched its  low  forthe  current expansion  in  1994,  accelerated a little  in  1995,  andaccording to  the  Greenbook, will  accelerate a little more  in  1996  andyet  a little more  in  1997.  CPI  inflation was  3-1/2 percent  at  anannual  rate  in the  first  seven months  of  1996,  up from  2-1/2 percentover  the  12  months  of  1995.  Last year, we  could see  signs  of  fallinginflation in August  that  showed up  in  the  data  in the  second half.This  year all  of  the  signs--tight  labor markets,  the prospect  forfurther increases  in  food prices,  the  pending labor  negotiations,inflation-jittery financial  markets,  fairly rapid growth  in M2  and insweep  adjusted Ml,  and high  levels of  long-term  interest  ratesrelative  to  current  inflation--suggest  that  inflation pressures arebuilding.  We have  taken  a risk  this year by failing  to respond  to  theunexpected growth  in both output  and prices.  We  should not  wantincreasing  inflationary pressures  to  get built  into  expectations ashappened  in the  late  1970s  and again in  the  late 1980s.  Absent  thekind of  inflation  credibility  that announcement  of  a firm  commitmentto price stability would give us,  we need a strong response  to  signsof  incipient  inflation pressures.  As  I read  the  Greenbook, thesesigns  are becoming  increasingly clear.  Thank you.

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The District economyremains healthy.  I have been  impressed most  recently by strength inmany of  the  natural  resource  industries.  Labor markets  continue  to betight  and if  anything they have  tightened  a bit  further.  They are  sotight  in  fact  that my kids  have found  jobs!  [Laughter]As  far  as  the national  economy is  concerned, I read thesituation much  like the  Greenbook.  Wage  increases clearly are morerapid.  They are not  offset  currently by  improvements  in productivity,and  I think  increased price pressures  are  likely  to  result.I would like  to  comment briefly on  an  issue  that  hasintrigued me recently,  though I must  admit  it  is  something  that  ishard  to  quantify.  It  is  the use  of  personal credit cards  by smallbusinesses,  by  entrepreneurs,  for business purposes.  There  is  noquestion that  this  is  going on,  and  I strongly suspect  that  it  isincreasing  in volume and breadth.  I say  that because  of  the  anecdotes8/20/96-23-that  I have  been hearing;  one  just has  to  raise  the  subject to  hearfrom  almost anybody in  the  small-business  arena how they use  theircredit  cards  for  business purposes.  It  is  not  surprising given theteaser  rates  that  are available  and the  ease  of  credit  cardapplications  as  opposed to  applications  for  small-business  loans  atbanks.  I think the  consumer credit data are being affected by thisphenomenon because  the  small-business people  I talk  to  do not  tend topay this  borrowing  down;  they tend to  roll  it  over  from  one teaserrate  to  another and  indeed to  build up an  increasing volume over time.It  does  not mean that  we ought  to be  sanguine  about credit-qualityissues.  Of  course,  that depends  on whether we believe smallbusinesses  are more  likely to  repay this  type  of  borrowing thanconsumers.  I do  not have any  convictions about  that.  But  I think itdoes mean  that when we  look at  consumer credit  data relative  tosomething  like disposable  income, we may be getting  a misreading ofcredit exposure  because  the  denominator  is  not  quite right.  What wewant to  include  in  the  latter  is business revenues,  business  income,or  cash flow,  or  something  like  that.  I have discussed this  with DonKohn and  I do not  think we have much data on  it,  but  it  is  somethingthat we may want  to  bear  in mind as  we  think about  some of  thesecredit versus income  issues.

MR. STERN.  No.  I really do  not.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  No, not  on  the  teaser rates.  These are  5.9,  6.9,8 percent  rates,  and they are  available without  any effort.Applications just  show up  in  the mail.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  By using these  cards,  small  companies  canoffset  considerable expenses  that  they otherwise may have.  Forexample, a small business may previously have had credit  cards  thatwere being charged to  the  company's  account  and may have incurredsizable  clerical  costs  to  reconcile  the  charges and various businessexpenses.  Diners  Club,  for  example, will  now give  all  of  a smallfirm's employees  a credit card against  the  employees' own credit.  Thefirm avoids  the  need to  reconcile  charges.  And if  there are  enoughemployee names  on the  list,  the  firm does  not have  to pay the  firstyear's billing  costs,  and it  can switch to  another card  and do  thatfairly easily.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  sounds  like  a decisively soundbusiness  practice!  Vice Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At  thelast  meeting  I reported that  the  Second District  economy had beenexpanding rather  rapidly.  It  has  continued to  expand but at  asomewhat  slower pace  in  recent weeks.  From May to  June, the  growth ofpayroll  employment  decelerated from 2.1  to  1.4  percent  in New Jerseyand from  2.1  to  0.1  percent  in  New York State.  June  unemploymentrates were  essentially unchanged at  6.3  percent  in New York and  6.1percent  in  New Jersey.  Our  retail  trade contacts  reporteddisappointing sales  in  June and July after a very  strong spurt  in May.8/20/96-24-Growth  in permits  for  the construction of  new homes  slowed  in June,and realtors  reported similar softness  in existing home  sales  for thecontrast,  the  commercial  office market  continued to  improve.  Growingdemand  for  office space  in the  absence  of  new construction pushed Junevacancy rates  lower throughout  the greater New York metropolitan area.Regional  price pressures  have remained subdued.  The  12-monthgain in  the New York-northeastern New Jersey CPI  was  just  2.7  percentin July compared with a 3 percent  rise  in  the national  index.  Thatcontinued a 3-year  trend of relatively lower  regional price  inflation.Going forward, we believe  that  expansion will  continue in  theDistrict.  The  government restructuring  in  our District  states  isslowing  this  year.  The drag on  job growth  from manufacturingcontinues, but  it  is  less  than  it was  in  the past.  Modest  overall  jobgrowth continues,  and as we  look  ahead to  next year, we  think that  thegovernment restructuring will  slow even further,  manufacturingbusiness and  consumer services.  So,  the  District  economy looks  as  ifit  is  beginning  to behave better  than  it  has  since  the  1990-91recession.We have, however, what may wind up being a rather difficultproblem  for New York State coming from  the  welfare reform bill  to besigned  this week.  The New York constitution is  unique  among stateconstitutions  in that  it  requires  that  the  state provide and I quote,"aid, care,  and support of  the  needy."  So,  it  looks  as  if  some  of  theeffects  of  the welfare  reform bill  simply cannot  take place  in NewYork State.  The state  is  at  least  as  litigious  as  any other part  ofthe country, and therefore  it  is  almost  certain  that because  the  stateconstitution  says  the  needy have  to  be  taken care  of,  lawsuits  willseek to  prevent  the  state  and  the  cities  from making any changes.  Thelevel  of  welfare  is  already higher  than  that  for  the  nation.  In NewYork State,  17  percent  of  all  children receive AFDC.  That compares  toabout  14  percent at  the  national  level.  The maximum benefit  in NewYork City is  $577  a month  for  a family of  one adult  and two  children.That  compares  to  $367  as  a national  average.  So,  we could have  asituation in which  the  already  fairly severe fiscal  problems of  NewYork State  and New York City could be  aggravated.  What one does  notknow is  whether  there  will be migration  caused by  changes  in welfare.The  scholarship  on  the  subject  says  that people do  not  in  fact migratebecause  of  differentials  in welfare  payments, but we  could get  into  asituation that  does  not  involve a differential  as  such but  rathermigration  from a state with no  welfare  payments for  a family to NewYork State,  which would be  constitutionally required to providewelfare  support.  We  do not  know exactly what  this  is  going to  do  tothe  state's  economy.  As  of  now, the  political  leaders of  the  stateseem  to  be  rather quiet  on  the  subject.Turning to  the  national  economy, our forecast  is  somewhatdifferent  from  that  of  the Greenbook  on both growth next year  and notsurprisingly,  therefore,  the  effect  on  the  CPI.  We  have  fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter real  growth  slowing to  1.7  percent  in  1997as  compared to  the  Greenbook's  2.1 percent.  We have the  overall CPIat  3.1  percent;  the  Greenbook has  it  at  3.3  percent;  and we have  coreCPI  creeping up  and  touching, although not passing, the  3 percentlevel  in  the  fourth quarter  of  1997.  Our  forecast  is  based  on an8/20/96-25-assumption that,  looking at  the  employment  cost  index,  there  will be agradual upcreep  in wage  inflation and  that the  sharp reduction  in thegrowth of benefits  that  the  economy has been  enjoying will  at  leastslow down.  We  have the  growth  in benefits plateauing, and I thinkthat  any model  used  for a forecast  should include  such assumptionsrather than  ones  that are more  optimistic.The board of  directors  at  the New York Fed, which  is  aparticularly  interesting board  that  includes a very good cross  sectionof  strong-minded, bright people,  is  of  the  very strongly held viewthat  the  forecasting models  are missing what  they think are  twochanges affecting  the performance  of  the  economy.  First,  with regardto benefits,  their  very firmly held view is  that  the rise  in benefitcosts will  continue  to  drop.  At  most  in their view, we will  have  arespite  in which there  may be  a bit  of  a slowdown  in the  reduction ofbenefit cost  increases.  But  they hold very strongly to  the  view thatthe managements  of  firms will have  to  continue  to reduce benefitcosts.  They will  do  it by pushing  those  employees who are not yetunder managed care  onto  that health  care  system and then  forcing theproviders  to  rationalize  further.  The net  result will be to  keepbenefit costs  dropping.  Again, we have  not assumed  that  in ourforecast,  but it  is  a very firmly held conviction by my board membersand one that  I have  difficulty not sharing.The other  thing that  they think we are missing relates  to  theview that  if  there  is  some  increase  in wage  costs,  at  this  stage  ofthe business  cycle  it  would not be wise  to  assume  that we would berescued  from its  effect by high productivity growth.  They are  verystrongly convinced that business  simply is  not being  run in  a way thatassumes  business managers will  pass  on  rising costs  by increasingtheir prices.  Quite  to  the  contrary,  the people  running businessesare aware  that  the  only shock absorber  is  a reduction inprofitability.  Since  business  executives  are not hired by theirstockholders  to have  their  firms'  profitability squeezed, they  aregoing to  work even harder,  as  in  the benefits  area,  to make sure  thattheir businesses continue  to  be rationalized.  Therefore,  costpressures will  simply not occur  and will not  be passed on  ininflation.  If  you were to  listen to  these wise people, you would saythat  the  trend in  the  inflation rate will  in fact  continue to  be  down.I do not  know if  that  is  likely to  be  the  case.  I don't think  it  iscertain enough by any means  that one  should put it  into any  kind ofofficial  forecast.  But  since  in  our  view the  present  stance ofmonetary policy  is  not creating an  inflation problem, one would nothave  to  believe any portion of  what my board members believe  toconclude  that  rising  inflation  is  not  a problem.  Thank you, Mr.Chairman.

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I had been  thinking  fairlypositively, feeling pretty good, about  things  since  our last  meetingin  early July.  Then,  over  the weekend, I got a call  from my  tenant  inLos Angeles  who  said he  had lost his  job  and was breaking his  leaseand moving  to New Jersey.  Then  I read the Greenbook and  thatdepressed me  further.  So,  I am not quite  sure whether  the  change inmy mood since July is  affecting my view as  to  what  is  the  right  thingto do  at  this  point.8/20/96-26-In agriculture  in  our  region,  this will  be  a down year  forfarm  income.  There was  a fair amount  of crop  substitution.  Farmerswere  able  to  plant more crops  than  they earlier  thought  they would beable  to,  but  the yields  are  going to  be  down and  the price  effect  isnot  going to  compensate.  So  farm income  is  expected to be  down, andthe banks  in  the  farm  areas  expect  some pressures  to  come  from that.One of  the  issues  that we kept  hearing about  through thespring and into  the  early summer,  even at  the  last meeting of  ourboard of  directors, was  concern about  speculative  excesses,  especiallyin the  high-tech  sector.  But  with the  sharp  overall adjustment  in  theprices  of high-tech  stocks on  the Nasdaq earlier  this  summer,  thatconcern has pretty much vanished  from  the  reports we are  hearing.  Wedeliberately went out  to  see  if  we  could find  stories of  other formsof speculation  that might be  symptoms  of  inflationary excesses  in thereal  estate sector, whether with respect  to  construction or  bidding upland prices,  and we  simply did not  find  evidence  of  that  in ourregion.  We  likewise have focused a fair  amount of  attention on  theauto  situation because of  the very widely held view that  GM isbuilding inventory, that it  wants  a strike,  and  that  it  plans  to  takea strike to get  some very significant changes  in work rules.  But wealso  are hearing about  a fair  amount  of militancy on  the  labor  side  aswell.  I am not  sure  how all  that will  net out.  We asked people whatwas being done by businesses  or by anybody  in  their  communities  inresponse  to  the possibility that  there will  be a GM  strike.  A lot  ofour  communities  are very heavily  influenced by General  Motors.  Theresponses  were  that nothing was  being done.  So,  I am not  sure whatthe  effects of  a strike would be  if  that  assessment  is  correct.The steel  industry says  that  its  orders  are  flat.  Orders  forsteel-producing equipment  to  renovate and expand domestic  facilitiesare  down very significantly  and are  expected to  decline further  in1997 because  of  what  is  characterized as  looming  overcapacity in  thedomestic  flat-rolled steel  sector of  that  industry.  However,  exportsof steel-making  equipment are very good.  Our  contacts  also believethat  the  recent increase  in  steel  imports will  fall  off  so  thatdomestic  demand will be  relatively  flat going  into  next year.District  employment  is mostly  expected to  be  flat at  very lowlevels  of unemployment,  and  there  is  little  talk of  wage  pressures  inspite of  continuous  reports  of  tight  labor markets  in  large  and smallcommunities.  We have  heard some  interestingly mixed views  about  theminimum wage  increase.  One  surprising response  from  two  differentsources was  that  the perceived adverse  effect  on retail  and fast-foodcompanies, which would expand less  or possibly contract  in  some  cases,would be  offset by  increased applications  for  employment at  otherfirms.  Contacts  at  investment  and bank branching  companies  said theywere  looking  forward to  the minimum wage  hike because  it  would meanthat more people would be  applying for  their  job  openings.  Inconstruction, a labor  leadersaid  that  union halls were  empty but thatwas  not  leading to  wage pressures.  He  said the  response of workers  tothis  situation  is  not  to  look  for higher  compensation.When we  asked what was  happening around the  region  as  aresult of  tight  labor markets--and we  confirmed  the responses  in  otherways--we were  told  that business  firms  simply were postponing projectsthroughout  Ohio  in particular and also  in central Kentucky and to  a8/20/96-27-lesser extent  in parts  of  eastern Kentucky.  Businesses mainly aresaying at  this point  that  they  are not  going to  get  the projectsfinished anyway before bad weather  sets  in,  so  they are  just planningahead for next  spring.  Their expectations now are  that  in  1997construction will  continue to be very good  in our part  of  the  country.In banking  there are  consistent  reports  throughout the  regionthat  loan  growth is  slowing,  including housing  and auto  loans.  Idon't know  to  what  extent the  auto  loans may reflect  the  decline  inauto  sales  that we  saw  in July--these  reports  may be  lagged--but  thereports provide consistent  indications  that bank  lending has  softened.There also  has been  some deterioration  of  credit quality.  Both thebankers  on  our three boards  of  directors  and our  community bankadvisory council have  told us  a lot  of  stories about  poor creditquality.  Some banks were  doing spot checks  on  credit ratings.  Aconsulting firm that  is  now offering  this  service went back andrescored all  the  consumer credit  files  of  a bank and found a verysharp drop  in the  scores  of  the  same  individuals  compared to  two  yearsago.  The main  reason for  the  drop  was  the  credit card debt  that  theseconsumers had incurred  in the  interim.  All  the bankers  reportedslower payments,  higher  delinquencies,  increased bankruptcy  filings,and larger allowances  for  chargeoffs  as  they  finish out  the year.  Thethinking about  1997  is  that  the  volume of  credit  extensions will  bedown, the  quality of  accounts will  worsen, and bank profitability willof  thing that Governors  Lindsey and Kelley cited as  a potentialdevelopment  earlier in  the  year.  It  seems  to  me  from what we arehearing  that  such concerns are now becoming more common.Let  me  turn  to  some remarks  about  the national  economy.  Wehave heard this  morning about  the  hope that  real  growth will  slow.  Inone  sense,  I hope  that  real growth does  not  slow down.  If  it  turnsout  that  the  investment boom that we have had  for  some  3 to  4 yearshas  strengthened productivity more  than  is being  assumed, then wecould enjoy more output  growth without  the  concerns  that we all  feelabout  inflation.  But  if  we are  going to  experience  slower outputgrowth over  the balance of  this year and  into  1997,  then  of  course weneed slower growth in  the  demand  for  that output.  The arithmetic  ofthe Greenbook  is  that  inflation  is  going  to  increase and that  is  why Iwas  disturbed by the  upward revision  in nominal  GDP.  Even  though  itis  only  .3 percentage point,  the  higher nominal  spending growthcontinues  for  the  next  six quarters.  If  we are  right  in assuming  thatoutput  growth is  going to  slow because  of  capacity constraints and  ifthe  assumption is  right  that nominal  spending growth  is  going  toincrease  for whatever reason,  then we  have baked rising  inflation intothe  cake and  that  is  unacceptable.

MR. KELLEY.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  In  the  fourth quarterof  1994  the  unemployment rate  dropped rather  precipitously from  6percent  and above, where  it  had been for  some  time previously, downinto  the  5-1/2  percent  range where it  has been  ever  since.  It  alsowas  right  around that  time  that capacity utilization in manufacturingbegan  to  drop  from its  peak  of  around 84.3  down  into  the  low 82s.  Forthe  past eight  quarters,  including this  one,  we have been pretty closeto  living  in  an economic  nirvana.  GDP growth has been right  on  trend:4 quarters over  2 percent,  1 quarter  at  2 percent,  3 quarters  under 18/20/96-28-percent.  The  economy has  been operating either at  or very close  tocapacity with very  little,  if  any, gap between potential and actualoutput.  Unemployment has been  steady at  around 5.5  percent, capacityutilization as  I noted has been declining slowly,  inflation is  flat  todown,  core CPI  has averaged 2.85 percent.  If  it  turns  out  that  thecore  CPI has  been overstated by a percentage point or  so,  that meansthat we  have been  even closer  to  an  economic  nirvana.  Other measuressuch  as  the deflator and  the  chain indexes  have been lower  in absolutelevels  but  the  trend has  looked the  same.  The expectation goingforward  in  the  Greenbook  is  for more of  almost  the same  through 1997:capacity utilization  steady at  82  percent, unemployment  steady at  5.4percent, and GDP growth right on  trend at  2.1 percent.  At  least  thatis  close enough  to  trend for  government work.  Government work, youknow,  is  defined as  measuring with a micrometer, marking with chalk,and then  cutting with  an axe.  [Laughter]  But  there  is  one bigdifference  in  the  forecast  that we have  been discussing.  That  is  thatinflation will  start  to  rise,  and that  is  projected to  start  to happenright  about now.  The  Greenbook shows  the core  CPI moving up  to  3percent  this  quarter and  to  3.2 percent  next year.  That wouldrepresent  a half percentage point jump  in a year's  time,  and I presumethat  if  the  forecast were  extended,  the trend would continue  to be  upfrom  there,  ceteris paribus.  Now, that  certainly would not beacceptable  to me  or probably to anyone  else  in this  room.  And I amafraid  that  the  .3 percent  increase  that we got  in  the CPI  in  Julycould be a harbinger of  things  to  come.If  we  are  going  to  get  this  rise in  inflation, how would ithappen?  We have been discussing all morning  that  it  would be  throughrising  compensation costs  that would get passed upstream into prices.If  that  is  going to  happen, several  things  in some  combination have  tooccur.  First,  the  rising wages  obviously have  to  drive unitproduction costs  up materially.  We do  see  that beginning to  happen,possibly through  the  ECI  and certainly the  new minimum wage  law.  Butthe  increase  in  production costs will  have  to  be  high enough toovercome  productivity growth, which  I continue  to believe  is  undermeasured, and the  flatter benefit  costs  that  the Vice  Chairman spokeabout  a few minutes  ago.  That  certainly could  occur.  There  is  nodoubt  about  that.  But  the  other  question is  whether  some pricingpower will begin  to  re-emerge  in  the  economy.  We  still  have a worldwith a lot  of  slack  in almost every economic  sector.  There stillseems  to  be fierce  competition  everywhere in  the  domestic  economy.  Ihave not  heard of  any easing  in  the  consumer's  fierce  resistance toprice  increases.  Also  for  this  to happen,  it would have  to  imply thatbusiness would be  able  to  refuse to  compromise  their very strongprofit margins.  Historically, of  course,  they have  compromised themwhen  they needed to.  I suppose  that  it  would also  imply thelikelihood or  need for  a lower  dollar.  These  conditions  for pricingpower  to  re-emerge  are  not  in view insofar as  I can  see.Nevertheless,  could all  of  this come  together and perhapsresult  in  an  inflationary surge?  Yes,  indeed;  I do not  think there  isany doubt  about  that.  But  can we  be confident  that  is  what willhappen,  especially very soon  or  starting now?  On  the  basis  of  thelong-term  historical record,  I think we probably would be persuadedthat  that  is  in  fact  extremely  likely.  But  on  the basis  ofdevelopments over  the past  two  years,  it  is  a little more difficult  tobe  convinced.  It  is  quite possible  that we could roll  on  along  likewe  are  for  some  time.  I do not  know how long,  certainly.  What8/20/96-29-happens  then  is  virtually anyone's  guess  in  such  a period.Admittedly,  that  is  a very sanguine  outlook, and frankly I am not  abit  comfortable with it.  It  is  dependent  almost  entirely on an earlyand substantial  slowdown  in the  expansion, and I have a specialconcern  in  that  regard given the possibility of  a new inventory  surge.But  the  slowdown has  to  happen  if  that happy outlook is  to ensue.  Itseems  to me  that  the  risks are  distinctly on  the  up side,  but  for  themoment  I would  say let us  continue to  give it  a chance.

MR. MEYER.  Thank you.  We clearly are  still  struggling withthe  same  two  questions  that  occupied us  at  the  last meeting.  First,is  the  economy slowing or  likely to  slow quickly enough to  trend to atleast  stabilize  the unemployment rate  at  the  current level?  Secondly,is  the  current  level of  the  unemployment rate  definitively below NAIRUso  that  it  ensures a trend toward higher  inflation?  The Greenbookgives us  an optimistic  answer  to  the  first  question and a pessimisticanswer  to the  second.  The  data available  since  the  last meeting gaveme a little more confidence  in my answer to  the  first question butstill  left me with uncertainty about  the  second.There has  been a lot  of mention  around the  table  already ofthe  risks of  higher inflation as  a result of  that uncertainty.  But  Ihope  that we won't  ignore  the  fact that  the  slowdown has  the potentialto  allow the  economy  to  sustain  trend growth at  the current  level  ofunemployment with modest,  stable  inflation at  least  for  some period.While the  persistence  of  the  slowdown  is  hardly assured, the  data  thathave  become available  since  the  last meeting provide evidence  ofslowing that we  could only anticipate then.  This  certainly  reinforcesmy confidence  in the  slowdown projected by the  staff, and  that  is  alsovery consistent with  the  consensus of  private  sector  forecasters.  So,I think a provisional  "yes"  is  in  order  for  the  slowdown scenario.  Ofcourse, what  we are  talking about here  is  really a knife edge--slowingjust  to  trend.  So we  obviously are going  to  have to  revisit  thisissue  and adjust as  necessary.The real  key is  the  second question;  that  is  the  heart of  ourproblem.  The staff  forecast  answer to  the  second question is  asfollows:  The unemployment rate  is  already below NAIRU and will remainso  after  the projected slowdown,  resulting in  a gradual, persistentdeterioration  in  inflation.  The minimum wage  increase  is  aningredient  in the  staff  forecast  of higher  inflation, but  it  is  aspice not  the  substance.  The  fundamental source  is  the  convictionthat the  current unemployment  rate  is  incompatible with stableinflation.  The problem we  face  in  acting on  this  forecast  is  that  thepattern of  rising  inflation that  it  projects going forward should havebeen under way for  some  time and  in  fact  is  not yet  evident.  The dataavailable  since  the  last meeting, while somewhat  mixed, did not alterthis  interpretation.  The  staff  views  the benign  inflation environmentin recent  quarters  as  a temporary  aberration relative  to  longer-standing  regularities.  Technically, the  excellent  inflationperformance  is  a mirror  image  of poor model  performance.  The  forecastof  higher inflation  going  forward simply reflects confidence  that  thismodel  error will  diminish or  disappear.  But  it  is  very hard todismiss  the  fact  that  the  extraordinary performance of  inflation  inrecent quarters  raises serious  doubts about  the  estimate  of  NAIRUcompared to  what  it was  in  earlier periods.  As  a result, my answer to8/20/96-30-the  question  of  whether or not  the  current unemployment rate  is  belowNAIRU has  taken  into account not  only  the estimate of NAIRU based on alonger period, but  also  the details  of  the  inflation performance overthe  last  couple of  years.  Indeed,  estimation techniques that  weighthe  more recent data more heavily suggest  that NAIRU has  declinedrecently and may be  close  to  5-1/2  percent  today.The  inflation picture is  even more  impressive than manyacknowledge.  More broad measures  of  inflation  have declined than haveappreciated;  they show no signs  of  broad-based acceleration and inmany cases  even hint of  ongoing disinflation.  Consider particularlythe  recent patterns  in  the  chain measures  of  the GDP price  index,  thegross domestic purchases price index,  and the PCE  price  index.  Theinflation rate  in each case  is  about  2 percent  over  the past  year andbelow 2 percent  if  it  is  measured net  of  food and energy  componentswhen  that breakdown is  available.  Each of  these measures posted alower  inflation rate over  the  year ended in  the  second quarter  thanover the preceding year.  At  least  for  the  available  core measures,each of  these  inflation measures was  near  its  recent  low in  the  secondquarter.  The  CPI  in contrast  is  closer  to  3 percent than 2 percent,and there  is  less evidence  of ongoing deceleration.  But  even for  theCPI, both overall  and core  inflation rates were  lower  over the  fourquarters  ended in  the  second quarter  than  over  the previous year.  TheECI  data  do  challenge us,  and we  are  seeing some  signs of  higherwages.  I think we  ought  to  take  into  account  that,  given the  slowdownin  the  rise  in benefit costs,  some  increase in wage pressures shouldbe passing forward the  benefits  that  firms  have received from thoselower benefit costs.  So,  we want  to  focus  on total  compensation, notjust  on wages.  There has  been some  edging up in  compensation;  it  isfairly small  so  far, and given  the  projection of  some  compression inprofit margins,  it  is  also  quite compatible with  stable inflation atleast  for  some  time.In  case  all  this may  seem  too  optimistic,  let me  end with acautionary note.  There has  been some  discussion around  the table  ofthe  potential,  or even  the  reality, that we  are already facing  fastproductivity growth  or  that we might  see  some  in  the  future or  thatfaster productivity growth might  offset  any increase  in  compensation.My reading of  the  data  leaves me somewhat  concerned about  thatinterpretation.  Productivity growth  over  the  last three years hasbeen very low, below 1 percent.  If we  look  at  the productivity trendover  that  three-year period--when, after  all,  the  economy has beengrowing at  a rate  averaging close  to  what we  thought was  trend overthat period--one would think that productivity growth during  thatperiod also would be  close to  trend.  In  that  case,  we might reach  thejudgment  that  the productivity growth trend is  a half  percent  ratherthan  a percentage point.  I think we need to  monitor  this path veryclosely.  But  if  the  trend rate  of  productivity growth has  in  factdownshifted, then  the  growth of  potential  will  turn  out  to be muchslower  than  the  Greenbook projects.  The  slowing in  growth  that willbe required to  reach trend will need to  be  more aggressive and lesscertain, and  the  price  inflation that we  should expect  from thecurrent trend  in nominal  compensation will be greater.  But  for now,steady as  she  goes.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.8/20/96-31-

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  At  the  last meetingI thought we  would have more  information by now.  We certainly havemore data, but  it  is  not  clear  to me  that we have much more  realinformation.  We  are  into  the  sixth year  of  this  expansion  and,depending on how we measure  them, we have had either  two  or  three softlandings.  We are now coming off  a strong second quarter.  Peoplearound  the  table have  discussed whether we are  either in  for  anothersoft  landing or  a continuation of  relatively strong growth.  I mustsay  that  I am quite  impressed by  the unanimity around  the  table interms  of  the outlook, which  seems  to be  settling on  the notion  ofmoderating growth.  Clearly, the  factors pointing to  further growththat we  have been citing  over  the  last  couple of  meetings  are  still  inplace.  In  fact,  I think some  of those  factors have  solidified.Financial markets  generally continue  to  support  growth.  With  theand more normal  alignment.  We  have had some  excitement  in  the  equityparticularly  in  the  blue chips,  has reversed itself  and there has beensubstantial  recovery.  If  we were  to  have additional  correction or  asideways movement,  that probably would be a healthy development  inthat  it  would allow earnings  to  catch up.  So, I think the  equityappear to be providing ample  credit and they seem to  be adjustingtheir credit  terms  to  changing circumstances.  Inventories  are  inreasonably good shape.  Growth  in business  investment  is  down from1994  and  1995,  but  this  sector of  the  economy  is  still  a contributorto  the  expansion.  As  long as  people are working, I do not  think thatwe will  see  a big pullback in consumption  expenditures.On  the  inflation  front,  a lot  of people  have  commented on  thesurprisingly good  inflation numbers,  and I think that  performance  isparticularly notable  in view of  the  length of  the  current expansion.We have had an uptick  in some  of  the  indexes,  although it  can be  saidthat  food and energy  largely explain  the  increases  in  the  CPI,  thePPI,  and  the prices  of  crude materials.  The core  indexes  all  showimprovement  in the  last  twelve months over  the previous twelve months.We do  not get  as many readings  on  the  deflators, which are  broader-based indexes,  but  they also  show improvement  over  the  last twelvemonths.Where do we go  from here with  respect  to  inflation?  Theoutlook  for energy prices  is  considerably improved.  I think that  foodprices  remain a risk.  Labor cost pressures  are  firming and are  likelyto  remain a risk.  With regard  to  the  recent ECI  data, it  is  hard  forme  to  believe  that aggregate  compensation costs  can be held downforever by improvements  on  the  benefits  side.  I hope  the members  ofPresident McDonough's board of  directors  are right  and that we are  onan ever  downward trending slope  in the  benefits  area, but  I have  totell you that  I am skeptical.  I can certainly understand why some ofthe  benefit costs  may go down.  State unemployment  insurance  costssurely could go down, but  improvements  in  other  components  seemunlikely to  be sustainable.  Assuming that  at  some point we do  not getfurther  improvement  in benefit  costs,  total  ECI  is  going to  beexerting more pressure  than we currently  are seeing.  The questionwill be whether business  is  going  to  absorb  these cost  pressureseither through the  traditional  squeeze  on profit margins  or  throughimproved productivity.  I am sure  that  I do not want  to  wade  into theproductivity measurement morass.  The recent performance of  inflation8/20/96-32-leads me  to  believe  that  the  economics  profession does  not  have a goodhandle  on productivity measurement.  I am sensitive  to  the comments bymanufacturers  that we must be  doing better  than  the  estimated 1percent  trend in  productivity improvement.  But  in  case  the  statisticsare  right, we  still have  the profit-margins  safety valve.  As much asbusiness managers do  not want  to  report declining profits  to  theirboards  of directors,  they have had to  do  so on  occasion.  So  profitIn  sum, we have had additional  confirmation of  an economythat  is  on  a sustainable  growth path or  even better.  There has  notbeen any significantly bad inflation news  since  our  last meeting, butI have  to  say that the  risks  remain on  the up side.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think GovernorPhillips  said it well when  she  said we have more data but not moreinformation, and maybe  that  is  good.  I have  two  observations.  Thefirst  is  on  the business use  of  credit cards,  which I think  iscertainly happening.  In  fact,  small businesses have  always usedcredit  cards  as  a means of  finance,  and that use  has  expanded.  It  hasexpanded in part because  a lot  of  the  small  businesses that  arecreated now  involve people who had lost  their previous jobs  throughdownsizings  or  are now in a relationship with their employers  thatinvolves consulting.  As  a result,  it  is  natural  for  these people  togo  to  credit  card financing.  However,  that is  not  necessarily a basisfor  optimism.First,  if  the  entrepreneur is  not  careful,  the  apparent  6.9percent  or  other low rate  of  interest  is  in  fact  quite expensivefinancing because,  if  the  entrepreneur  is mingling private  consumptiondebt with business debt,  the  IRS  will  quickly disallow the deductionof  the  interest.  For example,  for  a middle  class  entrepreneur, a 6.9percent  credit card debt  is  like  a 10.8  percent business  loan.  Thattax consequence has not  been  featured in Money Magazine  or  on  thefront page  of  the business  column  of  the Wall  Street Journal,  but  Ithink entrepreneurs will be  finding  out  about  it  soon  if  in  fact  thatis what  they are doing.Second, with regard  to  the  riskiness  of  credit  card debt,  itis  important  to  recall  that  the  proprietary type of  income  is  in thepersonal  income numbers.  There  is  no  real  capital behind what  thesepeople are  doing.  They are basically in  the  service  sector.  Therecapital behind what  they are doing.  In  a sense,  they are  givingthemselves  a consumption  loan,  but  they call  it  a business  loan, andthey pay themselves  higher  salaries  than  otherwise with the  differencein  interest.  The result  is  no different  from anyone else  running  up acredit  card debt  to  buy, say, a vacation.  So,  I think Gary Stern'spoint  is  well taken,  and  if  anything I think we  should be  a littlemore concerned about small-business-based  financing  than we  are  aboutgeneral  financing with credit  cards.As  far as  the  economic  data are  concerned, we are  going toget  more data and we may or may not  get  more  information in  theintermeeting period.  Where  I would think that we have a risk,8/20/96-33-however,  is  not  in  the U.S.  economy.  I think our risk will  stem fromthe activities  of  our good friends  located not  far  from the  FederalReserve  Bank of  New York  in  the  Second District and  our compatriotsaround the  world returning  from  the beach  and looking  for  a source ofmoney to  be made.  In  fact,  there  is  a great deal  of  money to  be madein speculating  on  the  European Monetary Union or nonunion or  whatever.In that  regard, there  are two  obvious  events  and probably a lot  morethat  are not  obvious.  One  is  the  French budget, which will be  a fakeand everyone  knows  it.  The question is,  how much of  a fake?  Thatshould cause  a little  instability with regard  to  the  franc/markconvergence.  The other  event--to  call  it  an  event really is  not  fair--is  the  Italian government,  which provides an  ongoing  spectacle.France and Italy both are risky.  I think there will be  lots  of betson both  the  franc  and  the  lira  and maybe  on  the  Spanish peseta thatwill  tend to  push money  into marks.  For  some reason  that  I am notfully comprehending, the  consequence  is  not  just  a mark/franc gain orI think  this  situation  is  risky for  us  for  two reasons.  The  first  isa long-run fundamental  reason and that  is  that  a weaker dollar willresult  in a net  stimulus  to  the U.S.  economy at a time when we reallydo  not need any extra stimulus.  The  greater risk  is  that  it willtempt policymakers  to  intervene.  I think that would be  a seriousmistake.  We  should be  ever vigilant in  watching the  data come  in, butI see  that  as  the  key piece of  information  that actually poses apolicy risk for  a potential  intermeeting move.

GOVERNOR YELLEN.  I had naively hoped that with  the  longintermeeting  interval  and so  many key data releases  that  the  fog  ofuncertainty hovering above  the  forecast might  lift by  the  time  of  thismeeting.  Unfortunately, as many of  you noted,  the body of  incomingdata  has provided only modest  illumination with respect  to  the  twofundamental  issues that  cloud the  outlook.  Those  are,  as  many of youhave  indicated, whether aggregate  demand is  poised to  slow towardtrend and whether core  inflation  is  in  the process  of  accelerating.My answers  to  these questions  really are  identical  to  those  ofGovernor Meyer.On the  first  issue,  I agree with him  and many of you and withthe  analysis  of  the  Greenbook.  It  seems  to  me  that most  labor marketand demand-side  indicators along with  the  Beigebook  and otheranecdotal  reports do  offer  tentative evidence  pointing to  a slowdownin  demand growth beginning  this  quarter.  But,  unfortunately, theextent and timing of  the  moderation in demand remain highly uncertainand  significant risks  remain.  I would enumerate  two.  With  inventory-sales  ratios  at  relatively  low levels,  a surge  of  inventory  investmentwith attendant multiplier-accelerator  feedbacks  seems  to  me to  be  adefinite upside risk.  Another risk is  from  the stock market.  Presenthighly  optimistic.  Market participants could  easily be  disappointed,particularly  if productivity performance  is  disappointing and wagepressures  intensify,  thereby setting  the  stage  for  a very significantcorrection.With respect to  the  inflation outlook,  my opinion  is  littlechanged  from  last  time.  Labor markets  clearly  remain tight,  butunemployment  has  not  decisively broken out  of  its  recent  range.  And,8/20/96-34-as  Governor Meyer  emphasized, broad measures of price  inflation arestill  declining.  If  one  smoothes  through the  noise,  it  seems  to methat  the  trend toward a more  rapid pace  of wage  and salary  growth isquite  firmly established.  At  the same  time,  growth in  benefit  costsremains well  contained, at  least  thus  far, and  I also  found the ViceChairman's comments  about the  prospects  here a hopeful  sign.  Thebottom  line  is  that we have  a very mild acceleration in  the pace ofnominal  compensation growth, which is  of  course what matters  to  unitlabor costs.  In  spite  of  this uptick, though,  nominal  compensationgrowth still  remains  well below  the pace  that  historical  econometricrelations would be predicting,  and the  uptick may thus  simply reflecta rebound toward a more normal  level.  So,  assuming that  productivitygrowth recovers  somewhat  toward its past  trend of  roughly  1 percent--and I agree  that  is  a significant  assumption--or  that profit marginserode somewhat,  I think that  the present  pace of  compensation growthshould be  consistent with  stable inflation  rates  in broad measures  ofproduct prices.Now, suppose  someone,  and that  someone  is  not  I, firmlyadheres to  the view that the  economy  is  currently operating at NAIRUand not below it.  Can one point  to  anything in  the  recent pattern  ofwage and price behavior that would provide strong  evidence againstthat view?  Here  I would agree with Governor Meyer;  I think the  answeris  no.  On the  other hand, historical evidence strongly suggests  thatNAIRU is  higher than  5.4  percent, so  it  would be both dangerous  andfoolish to  discount the possibility that  the  modest uptick  incompensation that we are now seeing is  the  beginning of  a processthat,  if  left unchecked, will  lead to  gradually acceleratinginflation.  I think  the minimum wage increase  does  compound the  risks.When  I reviewed the  transcript  of our  last meeting,  I found myself  instrong agreement  with the way Governor Kelley summarized the  situationand, of  course, with what he  said today.  Last  time,  he noted that  "itis  very correct  to  be  suspicious  of  the  notion  that  this  time  thingshave changed because assuming that  is  a classic  trap and frequently  aloser's  cry."  I completely agree.  He  then went  on  to  reason, as  hedid today,  that  there  are  actually very  strong indications  that  thingshave  indeed changed.  I also agree.  [Laughter]  In  other  words,  I am"conflicted."  I consider the  Greenbook  inflation  forecast pessimisticsimply because  it  assigns virtually no  weight  to  the possibility thatthings  have changed.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin, top that.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  Let  me put  a slightly more  positive cast  on  thesame  facts.  It  seems  to  me  that we  are being a little hard onourselves.  Actually, we  should be  fairly pleased not  only with theway the  economy is  performing, but with  our general understanding  ofit  as  expressed at  the  last  meeting.  There may have been no defini-tive data during  the  intermeeting period, but  at  least  there have beenno  surprises.  Everything  that  has  come  in  has been pretty consistentwith what we  thought.  In July, we knew  that  the  economy clearly wasgrowing  above  its potential,  that  labor  markets were very tight,  thatthere was  beginning to be  some  indication of  wage  acceleration butoffset by the  behavior of  benefit  costs,  and that  there  was  little orno  evidence  of  accelerating price  inflation.  We were all  a littlequeasy  about  the  forecast  of  a slowdown because we  could not  see  theslowdown  anywhere  in the  available  data.  It  was  not happening yet,and  there were two  big questions.  One was,  would the  slowdown in  fact8/20/96-35-occur  and begin to  be  evident?  And the  more  fundamental question was,could we  continue  to run  labor markets  this  tight without  incurringaccelerating inflation?  To put  it more  technically, was  there  a NAIRUand where was  it?  Was  it  indeed lower  than we had thought?  Theinflation risk was  clearly there.  It  seems  to me  that by August mostof  the  statistics have  come  in  on the  track that we  thought theywould.  The  evidence  of  a slowdown also  seems  to be  supported by  theanecdotal  or regional  information that  we have heard around the  table.Labor markets are  still  tight, and we have had a little more  evidenceof wage pressures but  no  evidence yet  of  price pressures.  The minimumwage  is  a new law as  of  today when  the  President  signs  it,  but  itreally is  not new information.  We knew about  the minimum wage when wewere here  last  time,  indeed since  spring.  If  it  was not built  intothe  actual  Fed  forecast,  it  certainly should have been on  our mindswhen we were talking about what  to  do because we  knew the minimum wagelegislation was going to happen.  So,  it  does  seem  to me  that westructured the problem  about right.  We  see  an  economy probablygrowing at  about what we  think  is potential.  We still  do not  knowwhether we can sustain  the  currently low  level  of unemployment  forvery long without  escalating wage pressures.I was  struck by the  fact  that  President McDonough was  theonly one who mentioned the  other big bill being  signed by thePresident  this week, namely, welfare reform.  That  legislation notonly threatens  to  put a good deal  of pressure on state  governments,and not just  in  New York, but  it  also puts  in strong relief  theproblem of  how tight  labor markets  can be.  If  we are going  to  besuccessful  in integrating  some  of  the welfare population into  thelabor  force,  it  is  important  that we keep  labor markets  pretty  tight.So,  erring on the  side of  not precipitating a recession, withouttaking on a serious risk  of  inflation,  still seems  particularlyimportant  for that  reason, not  just right  now but  over  the nextseveral  years.  My reading is  that we  still  have  the big question,given that  the expansion  is  slowing,  as  to  whether  labor markets  aretoo  tight.  The wage  information  is  inconclusive,  and I see  no  reasonfor  losing our nerve when we  see  things  coming  in about  on  the  trackthat we  expected.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Don?  If  not,  let me  seeif  I can  summarize  and review where  we are.  I think we  are in generalagreement  that  there  is  some evidence,  at  least  at  the margin, of  aslowing  in  the  expansion  from the  frenetic pace of  earlier  in thespring.  Homebuilding  is  beginning to  soften, but  I think  thesoftening  is modest at  best at  this  moment.  Certainly, the permits8/20/96-36-and backlog  data that  came  out  with the  starts  figures  for  Julysuggest  that  further significant erosion in  starts  does  not  appearlikely in August.  Motor vehicle  sales  clearly were lower  in July, aswas  pointed out  by Mike Moskow and  in  the Greenbook.  A verysignificant  part of  the  decline  in July was  the  result  of  theunilateral  action on  the part  of  General Motors  to curtail  verysignificantly its  fleet  sales.  General  Motors has been concernedsince  the  strike earlier  this year  that  its  inventory  structure  wasinadequate  to  supply both its  fleet  sales  markets and its  retailNonetheless,  motor vehicle sales  this  summer clearly are  a tad  softer;and a not  insignificant weakening in used car prices,  especially theratio  of used car prices  to  new car prices,  is  suggestive of  asoftening  market.  So,  I think a judgment  that  light motor vehiclesales will be  coming back in August,  seasonally adjusted,  is  thecorrect view, but  it  clearly is  not  one  that  implies a surge.As a consequence of  the weakness in  sales and especially  infleet  sales,  inventories of motor vehicles were  built up  at  a fairlysignificant pace  in July.  There also  is  evidence of  some  buildup ofinventories  in  the non-motor vehicle, nonfarm  area.  One  can pick upsome evidence  of this  in anecdotal  and state-level  data and also  frommodels using C&I  loans  and commercial paper  to  address  the question ofinventory  investment.  The evidence  is  still  very marginal and most  ofthe  inventory data that we have  for  the  third quarter clearly relatesto motor vehicles,  but  I think  there  is  no  reason to  disbelieve theprojection of  a significant uptick  in inventory  investment  that  showsup  in the  Greenbook  for the  third  quarter.  One potential  explanationof  the  low initial  claims and insured unemployment figures may well bethat we are getting  some  production for  inventories  in  the  thirdquarter.  We are not,  however, seeing any of  the  elements thatindicate  a rush to build because we  are not getting  the usual  signs  ofdelivery tightness,  stretching out  of  lead  times,  and shortages  ofvarious  goods  that  tend to be associated with that phenomenon.  Thoseare  the  types  of problems that would  induce  a significant  increase  insafety stocks  and bring on  the  kind of  accelerated inventoryinvestment  that creates  the major problems we have  seen  in  the past.What  seems  to  be  involved here  is not  an  increase  in safety  stocks,but  an  inadvertent  drawing down  of  inventories  to  levels  that  areexcessively  lean at any existing safety stock level.  Therefore, Ithink stocks  are being built up  at  this  stage, and that  could suggesta somewhat  higher GDP  than  one would normally expect.  Indeed, it  isprobably one  of  the  reasons why there  has been  an upward revision inthe  Greenbook's  third-quarter GDP  estimate.Consistent with a basic  slowing of  the  expansion, thoughwithout  any evidence  of weakness  or cumulative  erosion, is  the  factthat domestic  operating profit margins  finally appear to beflattening.  But  the  data do,  nonetheless,  suggest  that  those marginsremain high.  If  you were  to  believe the  individual  "bottom-up"earnings  forecasts  of  the  securities markets,  you would find  thatdifficult  to  believe.  However,  I think there  is  some merit  toGovernor Yellen's  suggestion  that  earnings  forecasts  are very likelyto  be discouraging because all  the  people who do  the  buildup  fromindividual  estimates  are getting higher domestic  operating profitearnings  than  those  who  are doing it  from  the  top  down.8/20/96-37-I think the  reason  for  this  is  that we are  getting mixedevidence with  respect  to  productivity gains.  This  is  crucial becauseif we disaggregate  the  total GDP  data and separate manufacturing  fromall  other sectors, we  end up with  the very interesting  issue  that wewere discussing at  the break.  In  the non-industrial  area  of  the  GDP,we are simultaneously getting a very significant  increase  in  unitlabor costs--in the  4 percent  area--and a very dramatic  rise  inoperating profit margins.  I suggest to  you  that while  those arereconcilable  arithmetically, and  indeed the  data will  reconcile, we donot get  the  sense that  everything will be coming out  exactly the waythat  the markets  presume.  We are getting anecdotal  reports  ofproductivity  improvements  in  the manufacturing and industrial  areaeven when we  move a lot  of  the  temporary worker hours  from theservices  area  into  the  manufacturing area, which  is where  they  shouldbe.  So, manufacturing productivity is  strong;  it  squares with  theanecdotal  information.  Profit margins are rising  in manufacturing butless  so  than  in  nonmanufacturing.  Something has  to  change in  thisdata system, and I am frankly curious  to see how  it ultimately willcome  out  at  the  end of  the  day.The  flattening of  profit margins  on  the presumption  that  thatis  indeed happening  is  consistent with the  expectation  that  theexpansion  in  the capital goods  market will gradually slow down.  Yet,there is  no doubt  in my view that  it  is  premature to assume that  theeconomy is  backing off  its unsustainable rate  of  expansion.  Productpronounced upside pressure  in  industrial  commodity prices,  lead  timesare  dull,  and  inventory shortages  do  not appear  to exist.Nonetheless,  there  exists  a tautness  in  labor markets  that has beenthere all  year  long,  and  I think,  as has been discussed at  lengtharound this  table,  the  crucial  inflation question that we  confront  ison  the  labor  side.  Our difficulties  lie with the  issue  of  tight  laborimprovements.  The  issue  that the Vice  Chairman raised with respect  tobenefits  is  one  that  I, too, hear out  on  the  hustings.  That  is,  whileeveryone  acknowledges  that  the  sharp deceleration in  the  cost ofhealth insurance benefits  largely reflects  the  dramatic  shift  fromfee-for-service  to managed care,  it  is  apparently not  correct topresume  that  the  end of  the  adjustment will  occur when we  reach thepoint where  98  percent of  workers  are  in managed  care.  There has beendramatic pressure from  the  business  community to  move  from  fee-for-service  to managed  care.  When that  is  completed, they are  going  to  gostraight at  the managed-care providers  the way  the Vice Chairmansuggests.  Whether  they  are  successful  or not  remains  to  be  seen,  asGovernor Phillips  quite  appropriately suggests,  but  I do  not  think theautomatic  elimination  of  further containment  of  benefit  costs  isnecessarily an  obvious  forecast.Nonetheless, with the  U.S.  economy operating  at high levelsand very little  evidence  of  cumulative weakness in  recent data,  therisks  are  and remain unquestionably on  the  high side.  It  would nottake much to  induce strong final  demand  that would require anaccelerated inventory buildup  coming from  safety stock concerns.  Thisis  the  type of development  that  occurred in  1994  but  is  not as  yetshowing  any signs  of  emerging.  Consumer  confidence unquestionably ishigh, and the balance  sheets  of  households,  with  the  obvious  exceptionof  the debt problems  in  some  of  the  middle-to-lower  income  households,are  in very good shape.8/20/96-38-While there  appears  little upside margin, alternatively  itwould not  take much  softening  to  reduce pressure on markets  and evenlabor markets  with a lag.  As  I indicated in my Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony, I believe  we are  at  a key juncture where  small  changes  inmacro demand can tilt  the  economy in wholly  different  directions withdifferent  outlooks.  Current  forecast  error ranges easily  encompasseither  scenario.  The  economy has  eased  since the Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony but  only marginally, and it  would not take much  to  put usback in a tightening situation.  Certainly,  the declines  in  initialclaims and unemployment  insurance  are not encouraging  in  this  regard,though that may be, as  I indicated earlier, a reflection oftemporarily higher production  in order  to replenish perceived depletedinventory levels.  I would  suggest  that  is  more  likely  the  case  ifindeed it  is  showing up in  the  aggregate  numbers rather  than  anyevident upsurge  in  final demand.  Of  course, while  it  is  true at  leastin  the  retail  area that we are  getting  somewhat better  chain storenumbers  for August,  the  sales  figures  for the  week ended August  17ththat  came  out  this morning  tilt  down again.  The  chain store numbersdo appear  to  be modestly better seasonally adjusted  for August  thanfor  July, but  it  does  not  appear to  me  to  be a big deal,  and theimprovement does not  fully reverse  the weaknesses  that were apparentin both June and July  retail  sales data.As  far  as policy is  concerned, if  the  economy is  in  theprocess  of growing  at  an unsustainable pace  or moving  in thatdirection, raising  the  federal  funds  rate  only 25  basis points  is  notgoing to help much at  this  stage.  Fifty  to  seventy-five basis pointswould more  likely be  required.  Although the  real  funds  rate  is  only  ashade off  its  peak for  this  cycle,  a much larger  increase  should notbe necessary if  indeed we have moved toward an unsustainable pace  ofeconomic  growth.  Had we been  in a firming mode  this year, it  wouldseem prudent  to me  to  tack on  an additional  25  basis  points  at  thismeeting, as we did under not  dissimilar  circumstances  in  early 1995.But any upward move at  this  point  implies  a reversal  of  trend, whichthe  markets will  quickly price  in,  reflecting our  increasedcredibility.  They believe we have  insights  that  they do  not have;  andmy suspicion  is  that  is  a dubious proposition to  say the  least.  Theone  scenario  that I would very much  like  to avoid is  our reversal  ofthe  trend and moving  the  funds  rate upward just  as  the economy is  inthe  process  of  measurably slowing down.  As  I indicated  in July, ourpolicy stance  is  not  sufficiently out  of  line currently  to  requirethat we move quickly.  I had expected that conditions  by now woulddictate the  reversal  of  trend, but  as  a consequence  of evidencesuggesting  some slowing  in  the  economy, the  case has  become  lesscompelling than I thought it  would be.  I believe  that we canprudently hold off  for  a while to  assess developments  to make  adetermination  of  whether or  not  the economy is  moving  at  anaccelerated pace  or gradually beginning  to  ratchet  down.  Nonetheless,if we  do choose  alternative  B, which  is  the  one  I would like  topropose, I trust we will continue  our asymmetric bias.

[SECTION]

PRESIDENT  BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  as  I said  earlier  today,my main focus  has been on  the  second  of  the  two  questions  we have beenlooking at.  The possibility clearly  laid out  in the  staff  forecast  isthat  the trend inflation rate  is  set  to  increase  even if  there  is  somefurther slowing  in  the  growth of  demand.  Given this  situation,  Istill  favor  some  tightening of  monetary policy.  I think  there  isalready ample  evidence that  the  level  of  economic  activity warrantswhat  I would describe  as  a moderate mid-course correction to  reverseat  least part  of  the  easing that was  undertaken last winter.  I mustsay that  I was  impressed by Don  Kohn's comments  about  inertia  and thepotential  cost  of waiting  to  take  this  action.  I recognize  that  thefinancial markets are not  looking  for  any tightening action  today andthat  such an  action would be  a surprise.  But  it  seems  to me that  suchan  action could be quite beneficial  to  the atmosphere  of  the marketsin the  weeks ahead.  The markets have been,  it  seems  to me,exceptionally edgy over  the  last  intermeeting period.  They know thereis  an  inflationary risk, and they  are not  sure  how or when we aregoing to  deal  with it,  especially given the  fact that we  have notacted to  date.  The situation  and the  atmosphere are  almostreminiscent  of  the early part of  1994,  after we made our  initial move,when  the markets were still  waiting  for  the  other  shoe  to  drop.  Onlythis  time  they are  waiting for  the  first  shoe  to  drop.  A 50  basispoint move  today would essentially drop both  shoes.  You suggested  inessence in your  comments  that  the markets would  likely conclude  thatsuch  a move would be all  or nearly all  that would be  required if  infact  the expansion  continues  to  decelerate.  So a 50  basis point movewould be what  I would favor  today.  Beyond any longer-term settlingeffect  it might have on  the markets,  a relatively decisive  action  likethis would put everybody  on notice  that we  firmly intend to keep  ourcommitment  to  hold the  line on  inflation.  It would be a very clearsignal  for anyone who  needs  it.  Finally, while  I still  think  a 50basis point move  is  the  better move,  in  this case  a quarter of  a loafis better  than  none.  So  if  1/2  point  is not  acceptable,  I wouldrecommend  that we  consider doing 1/4  point.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I believe  that  therisks  to  economic  performance are on  the high  side  in  the  sense  thatthe  stage  is  set  for more wage  and price  inflation  than  is  desirableand perhaps  than market participants  expect.  To  be sure,  the  pricedata  so far  this year can be  read favorably, but  I know  I am preachingto  the  converted in saying  that we have  to  be  forward-looking.  Therehas  been a lot  of  discussion of  productivity and,  of  course,productivity  is  important;  it  matters  for a lot  of things.  But theproductivity performance  notwithstanding, whether we have mismeasuredit  or not,  we do  know for  sure  that output growth  so  far  this year  isunsustainable because  employment  growth thus  far  this year  has beenroughly twice  the  sustainable growth of  the  labor  force.  Initialclaims  data  suggest that  this may be continuing.  There are  also  signsthat aggregate  demand,  in  fact,  is moderating.  But  the  evidence  ispreliminary on  this  score,  and  it  is  not at  all  clear that  it willmoderate to  a degree  that will  significantly change  the  labor marketconditions  I just  described.  Given  the  risks  as  I perceive them,8/20/96-40-waiting to act  might damage our  credibility, and more  importantly inmy view, might well  make it  more difficult  for us  to  containinflationary pressures.  This  could ultimately produce circumstancesthat would  threaten the  ongoing  expansion of  the  economy.  Movingmodestly toward restraint now would seem to  entail relatively  littlerisk to  economic performance  and moreover could start  us  down the  roadthat  over time would not  just  contain inflationary pressures but  couldset  the  stage  for  some  reduction  in  them.  I would  think that  would bea prudent  course of  action and  favorable  for  the  long-term health  ofthe  economy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, although  the pace of  economicactivity seems  to  be  slowing as  expected, my best  estimate  is  that  thelevel  of  activity will remain  somewhat above  its  long-run potential.The economy's  capacity and  the  effects  of worker  insecurity on wagepressures, of  course,  are  subject to  uncertainty.  In my opinion andthat  of  the  Greenbook, we  face  rising  inflation.  The  inflationincreases  projected by  the  staffs  at  our Bank and  the  Board imply thatthe  current  level  of  short-term rates  will  cause  inflation toaccelerate  through  the  forecast  horizon  and beyond.  I am persuaded bythis year's pickup  in labor costs  and the projected increase  in  all  ofthe  inflation  indexes  in the Greenbook.  Therefore,  I believe  it  isprudent to  raise  the  funds  rate by at  least  25  basis points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I am persuaded byyour explanation of what  is  going  on  and the  situation we  findourselves  in,  but  I am chastened by Don Kohn's presentation  of  therisk of  an  excessively slow reaction to  a policy requirement.  Isupport your proposal.  I think  that  a 25  basis  point  increase  in  theface  of  a market  expectation  of  no action would be extremely risky inthat  it would absolutely assure  the market  that  it  would be  25  plus  25plus God knows when that would end, and  this would tank  every marketthat  I can think of.  When we  move,  it would  seem to me  that  the moveshould be  50  basis points  and that we would  try to  explain  it  as  arecalibration  of  monetary policy.  That  is  fairly risky in  that  I amnot  sure  that  there  would be  three people outside  this  room who wouldbelieve  it.  But  at  least  to me  it  makes more sense  than  to do  25  andto  start what would definitely be  interpreted as  the  installment  plan.I think the  economy  is  at  that  balance point  at which--as yousuggested, Mr. Chairman--a move of policy now with  the  assumption  thatwe know all  kinds of  things we  really  do not  know, would be  verylikely to  produce an  excessive market  reaction, which could very welltilt  the  economy  into much  slower growth  than  is  either desirable orappropriate.  So,  recognizing that  the  risks are  on the  high side  andtherefore  the  directive  should be  asymmetric,  the  better judgment nowis  to  maintain the  fed  funds  rate  at  its present  level.  Therefore,  Isupport your  recommendation.

MR. JORDAN.  I agree with your  characterization of  thesituation and the  kind of  decision that we are  faced with, Mr.Chairman,  and I agree with  the remarks  that  the Vice Chairman just8/20/96-41-made.  I thought we were  correct  in  our use  of  the  installment plan  tolower the  funds  rate  the  last  three  times  we did so  after  it hadpeaked at  6 percent.  I do  not  think that we would be  correct  instarting off  on an  installment plan now because we would be  sayingthat we misjudged the  economy and the  inflationary pressures--that weshould not have  been  cutting the  funds  rate in  the  first place,  and wehave  to  roll  it  all  the  way back up  to  6 percent.  That would be  avery, very  strong message.I want  to  explain to  the  staff  of  this  Committee what  itwould take  to persuade me  that  they are  right about  the  outlook.  Iwill put  it  in  the  form of  a challenge.  I will  not blame you  if youdo not  like the  way I am going  to  characterize  this,  [laughter]  butwhat you have said  to  me  is  that  the  minimum wage  increase  isexpansionary for  the  economy.  You have  said that  raising  the minimumwage and other wages  carries  through  to  higher prices,  lowers  realinterest rates,  and  therefore expands  the  economy at  a faster pace.Thus,  if we  raise  the minimum wage to  $10,  we will have  a roaringboom.  This  just  defies credibility  to me.  So,  I have  to  judge mypolicy decision on  the  basis  of  a disbelief  in  the Greenbook  forecastfor nominal  spending.  I do  not  even believe  the  real part, but  thenominal part bothers me more because  of  its  direction.  I cannot  getaway from  the  idea  that  the purchasing power of  the  dollar hassomething to  do with the  dollar and  the supply and demand  for  it,  andthat what we are  trying to  do  is  to  stabilize  the value  of  the  dollar.I would like  to  have a definite  time horizon for  when we  are  going tostabilize the purchasing power  of the  dollar and keep  it  there.  WhenI see  your recent numbers  and the  projection of  central bank moneygrowth accelerating, I have to  be  concerned.  But  I have a great  dealof  trouble separating  out what  is  going on  in  the demand  for  foreignuses  of  our  currency, that component  of  central bank money, and thecontraction  in  the reserve  balance component  of  it.  I would have  toassume  that  the demand  for  reserves  is  contracting even  faster  thanthe  supply of reserves  in order  to  conclude  that we are  seeing greaterinflationary pressure.  I think there  is  no  evidence  for that.  If  youhave evidence and you can  convince me,  then  I would change my mind.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I ask myself,  what are we doing here?[Laughter]

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That's  a pretty good  question.  Do you have  ananswer?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes,  I have  an answer to  that.  We  are  tryingto  keep  the  economy  on  track.  We  are  trying to  keep  inflation low soas  to  provide  the  best atmosphere  for economic  growth.  This  is  noteasy  to  do,  and we have not  always been very successful  at  it.  But wehave  been more  successful  over  the  last  10  years  and particularly overthe  last  5 years  than we  had been  in earlier years.  Part of  that  isbecause we have  tried to  put  an  emphasis on  being forward-looking.Looking back  over  the  long  run,  it  seems  to  me that most of  the  timeswhen we  could with 20/20  hindsight  characterize  the  Fed as  having madean  error,  it was mostly on  the  side  of  waiting too  long, as  Don Kohnhas  mentioned, and  then having to  move harder  than we would have hadto  otherwise,  clamping down and  feeding into  the  business  cycle.  Iprobably have  the name  of  this philosopher wrong but  I think  it  was8/20/96-42-Santayana who  said that  "those who ignore the  lessons  of history  aredoomed to  repeat  it."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You are  correct.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Good, I am  glad.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  last  time  I spoke  to him, he  saidthat.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. You are  older and wiser  than I am, Mr.Chairman!  Now, it  may be  that the  experience of  the  last  8 to  10quarters  is  a signal  that  the  economy is  changing.  But we  arestarting to  see  wage pressures  and we are  starting to  see a flatteningout,  if not  an  upturn, in  most of  the broad measures of  inflation.  Inthis environment,  I do not  think we can be quite as  sanguine as manyhave suggested.  I think we need to  be very humble  about  our  forecastsof  the GDP slowdown being enough  to  guide  this rather  large  andcumbersome plane  totally  on  instruments without human  intervention, atleast at  this point  in  time.  I think we need a course correction.  Ithink we need to  step  in and start  steering this economy  a little bit.Now, it  seems  to me  that  if,  in  the  expectation  that  the  expansionwould be  slower, we  adjusted policy  in 25  basis point  increments,  thenwe  could start  to  steer  it  against  an upside  threat  in smallincrements  as  well.  It  might be  that  the markets will  overreact,  butI think that  overreaction would be  short-lived.  I do  not  necessarilybelieve  that  they would think we are  all  knowing because many of  themhave  seen  the  same trends  that we  see  in some  of  the  data.  I amconscious  of  the  fact  that  a lot  of  what we are  getting from therather than  how they think we  should react.  If  some  uptick in  thethem back up  to perhaps  where they were  earlier  in  the  year, thatmight be  helpful  in restraining  some  of  the  possible sources  ofovershooting  that might be  in  the  GDP  forecast.So,  I would agree with  those who recommended a coursecorrection at  this point.  I could go  with 25  basis points.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, I support your  recommendation.Although it  is  difficult  to  judge  the  stance  of policy with any greatprecision, it  is  still  my sense  that with  our current  policy and theslowing of  economic  activity that we  are beginning to  see, we  likelywill be  able  to  sustain  a pace  of  moderate growth without  a pickup  inthe  broader-based measures of  inflation.  Consequently, I would have  apreference for  keeping the  current  funds  rate  of  5-1/4  percent  inplace and giving  things  a chance to  play out a bit more.  I amcertainly comfortable  with  the  asymmetrical directive.Having said  that,  I again would like  to  join those whocontinue to  urge us  to do  additional  study and debate,  both inside  andoutside  the  System, on  the  costs  and benefits  of  a policy aimed atmoving inflation  rates  still  lower.  Current  circumstances  and thoselikely to be  immediately  ahead may  in  fact provide  us  an  excellentopportunity to pursue  such  a policy.8/20/96-43-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman, I believe  that we  should increasethe  federal  funds  rate  now at  least  1/4  percent.  As  I read theevidence,  inflation is  not  slowing.  I think  that  is  a fact  and thatthe  indications are  that  it  will rise.  I would also  argue  that  evensmall but persistent  increases  in inflation  over  time  can have afairly dramatic  effect  on the  purchasing power of  the dollar whencompounded.  Also,  in  the  context  of  our  currently strong economy andthe  objective of  sustaining growth over  the  long  term--and  I recognizethat policy involves balancing risks--I  believe that  a small  increasenow would bring more benefits  in terms  of  moderating the  inflationarypressures  that  are  facing us  than  the  risks  it would incur ofaccelerating  the  economic  slowdown  that  is worrying us  to  some degree.I think it  would be prudent  for us  to  take  this  action now.  Theeconomy can afford this  action, and  I think  the  long-term benefitswould be  greater  for us.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman.  Itseems  to  me that  to move  up now, when we did not  in July  and when wehave seen evidence of  the  slowing of  the  economy, would be a very hardthing  to explain and would risk a different  kind of  credibility.  Yousaid  in your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  that  we expected the  economyto  slow.  Now we are  seeing that  it  is,  and suddenly we would bemoving  in  a direction not  suggested by that  slowing.  Clearly therisks of  inflation are  there.  We  have to  remain vigilant.  I stillbelieve  it  is possible  that we will  not have  to move;  I do not  thinkthat  is  the  general view around this  table.  The general  view seems  tobe  that  it  is  a question of when rather  than whether.  We will  knowmore as  time goes  on.  It  is  more likely that we  will  have to  move  atsome  time  if  this economy does  not  slow more  than predicted by theGreenbook, but  I believe we have  time to  make  that decision.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  With respect  to  the  stance  ofpolicy, I would  say with some conviction  that  I do  not  think it  isrestrictive and quite  likely  it  is  accommodative, whether we  look atthe  growth rates  of monetary aggregates  or a funds  rate  that  has notmoved in  the  face  of  rising market interest  rates.  I think the  riskis  that  inflation will move  higher and perhaps more  importantly, itwill  move higher from  a level  that  I think is  already unacceptable.We ought  to  be moving  closer to  price stability, not moving away fromit.  As  a result,  I would  favor an  increase  in  the  funds  rate  todayand, for  reasons  that  have been  stated by others,  an  increase of  50basis points.Let me  just make  a couple  of  other comments  quickly.  I thinkwe are  suffering from  the  fact  that  we do  not have a nominal  anchorfor monetary policy.  We do  not  seem  to have  a way  to make  a judgmentabout what  the  stance  of  policy is  and relate  that  to  a longer-runinflation  outlook.  As  a result,  I think we have  become  excessively8/20/96-44-focused on what  is  happening  with respect to  growth as  opposed  tolooking  at  inflation.  I think our  actions have  in  fact beenasymmetric.  We have tended to  show  in our  actions  in recent monthsmore concern about  the prospect of  slowing growth  than we have  aboutrising  inflation,  let alone  getting  inflation  lower.  I think we  havegotten away with it  so  far because  a good bit  of  credibility has beenbuilt up  over the  last  5 or  10  years,  and  for good reason.  But  if  ourindicator  of  the  time  to  move is  seeing  the  whites of  inflation'seyes--I  have not heard anybody explicitly say  that, but  I worry aboutthat  sometimes--when we  get  to  that  point, we will  have  lost  a goodbit  of  credibility and will probably be  looking at  a very ugly end tothis expansion  just  to contain  inflation, as  others have said.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Mr.  Chairman, I also  support  "B" asymmetric.My suspicion  is  that  at  some  point we  are going to  need  to  tighten,but  to  me  the  timing is  not  clear.  If  the expansion  continues  at  anabove-trend pace, the  inflationary pressures  are bound  to prevail.  Onthe  other hand, if  productivity is  better than  the historical  levels,the  move  could be deferred.  So  it  seems  to me  for now  that  "B"asymmetric  is  the  right  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  your recommendation.  Icontinue  to  consider the  inflationary risks biased  to  the up  side.  Ibelieve we have  agreed that regardless of  whether we preferopportunistic  or deliberate  strategies,  we should resist  any sustaineduptick  in inflation.  I support  that  policy.  I also  think Don Kohnhas properly warned us  that  if  we are  actually below NAIRU and fail  toact,  all  we will  end up  doing  is  buying more  output  and more jobs  nowat  the expense  of  less  output  and  fewer jobs  later,  in  effect addingto  cyclical  fluctuations  rather than mitigating them.  Ordinarily, Iwould prefer  a preemptive approach to  controlling inflation  ratherthan,  as Tom Melzer put  it,  simply waiting to  shoot until we have  seenthe  whites  of  its  eyes.Nevertheless,  I think  the  current  situation  is  unusual.  Inspite of  the  apparent  inflation risk, which has been present now for aconsiderable  time,  inflation has been declining, not  increasing,  andnow demand finally  appears to  be moderating.  So,  the  level  ofuncertainty about  the  future course  of  inflation under current policysettings  is  extremely high.  And  particularly because  a move todaywould constitute  a change  of  direction and a surprise  to  the publicand  to  financial markets,  I would prefer to  have a slightly higherdegree  of confidence  that  a policy change  is  actually needed beforemaking  one.  In situations  where forecast uncertainly  is  extremelyhigh,  I, at  least,  find it  appealing  to  look  for  some  guidance fromthe  recommendations  of  sensible  feedback rules,  so  I would simplyreiterate what Don Kohn pointed out,  which  is  that  the  funds  ratejudged by Taylor's Rule  or  other  simple benchmarks  is  now at quite  areasonable  level  given current  levels  of  unemployment  and inflation.On the  other  hand, the  rule definitely calls  for  a policy  adjustment8/20/96-45-if  either of  two  things  occurs:  first,  if  the  degree of  labor marketslack declines  appreciably, presumably because  demand fails  to  slow aswe  anticipate;  or  second, if  broad  inflation measures rise.  Underthose  conditions,  I would certainly support  a tightening of policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman, I also  support your recommendationthat we make no  change in policy at  this meeting  and retain anasymmetric  directive.  This position reflects my willingness  tosupport  trend growth at  full  employment with stable  modest  inflationin  the near  term, patiently awaiting opportunity down the  road forrenewed progress  toward price  stability.  I simply am not persuaded atthis point  that  the  current policy setting  is  inconsistent  with stableinflation.  Given the  lags  in  response to monetary policy,particularly when it  comes  to  inflation,  it  is  often prudent  to moveto  change policy on  the basis  of  forecasts,  and that  is  the challengethat  the  staff  forecast presents  to  us  today.  But my willingness  tomove preemptively in  this case  has  to  be conditioned by what  seems  tome  the  inconsistency  in  the  story that  the  current unemployment rateis  too  low to  sustain stable  inflation,  given that we have  seen stableinflation  for  the  last  two years.  So  at  this point,  I think  it wouldbe prudent  to  hold  the  line and wait  for additional data.Nevertheless,  I think there  are  risks  of  higher growth and  there areundoubtedly risks  that  inflation at  the  current unemployment  ratemight move  up.  Therefore,  I think  the  asymmetric directive  is  veryreasonable.  Thank you.

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman,  I support your  recommendation fora  "B" asymmetric directive, but  as  I mentioned  in my  comments,  I amconcerned  about  the  labor  cost pressures  exceeding productivity.  Ialso  am concerned about  the potential  for allowing some upcreep ininflation  to  be built  into  the  economy  late this  year and in  1997.  Ofcourse,  waiting makes  the  September and the  November meetings verycrucial decision points.
