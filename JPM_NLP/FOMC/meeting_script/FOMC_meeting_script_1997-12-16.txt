CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I would  first like to welcome  our temporary newBank representative,  LeGrande  Rives.

[SECTION]

MR.  RIVES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Also, sadly, this is Charlie  Siegman's last meeting  afterseveral  generations  of watching the ups and  downs of these proceedings.  We are  going to missyou, Charlie.

[SECTION]

MR.  SIEGMAN.  Thank  you very much.  On  my list of things from the FederalReserve  that I will look back to, this is one of the activities that I will miss very  much.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  When all of a sudden  we begin to see  a hole in the staffanalysis, we will  infer its  cause.  [Laughter]  Would somebody  like to move approval  of theminutes of the November  12  meeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection,  they  are  approved.  Mr. Fisher, youhave the  floor.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring  to thepackage  of colored charts, which  you should find in front of you.On the  first page  are charts  covering  the same  information we  haveshown  in the past, but we have  changed the source of the data for the current3-month deposit  rates.  Traders  have  persuaded me that the LIBOR fixingprovides  a better comparison  than the Eurodollar series  we have been using,so that is  a slight change.Focusing first on U.S. forward rates,  there are  two points to which Iwould draw your attention.  One is that there has been relatively little netchange  in these rates  since the November meeting,  as shown by the redlines, but clearly  some compression  has occurred  as the money market yieldcurve has become increasingly  flatter in the period since October.  I think1 Copies of the charts used by Mr. Fisher are  appended  to this transcript.12/16/97the updrift in the solid line, the current dollar LIBOR, reflects a fairlytypical  year-end phenomenon.  I would not attach  any significance  to that.Looking at the German  forward  rates, Mr. Tietmeyer said ratherpublicly on November  14  what other Bundesbank officials  have  been sayingfor some time, namely,  that the market should not expect German  rates to goup by  120 basis points between now  and next May  to meet Italian  rateshalfway, as  the market had come to believe  was going to happen.  In effect,Tietmeyer was  saying that the German  economy is  stronger but not really allthat strong.  You can see the gentle  drift downward in German forwardrates.  If you look  at the solid blue line, the current  mark LIBOR, it is quiteinteresting that the spike in early December  parallels the spike in the yenLIBOR,  shown in the chart below, at the time of heightened concerns  aboutthe Japanese  premium.  Now,  this is interesting  for those of us in the moneydifferent.  In the British Bankers  Association panel for the yen  LIBORfixing, there  are eight Japanese  banks, whereas  in the panels  for the dollarand the mark,  there are  only three and the calculation is done by throwingout the  highs and  the lows.  So, I think the spike  in the German  moneya reflection  of the credit  premium, as it were, from  the demand  side but apushing through  of the demand coming from the Japanese banks.Turning  to the Japanese  market, we need a  little magnification of thebottom panel  to see what is going on in Japan.  So, if you turn to the secondThree rates  are traced in the top panel:  the current yen  LIBOR 3-monthdeposit fixing  in dark purple,  the 9-month forward  3-month yen deposit ratein orange-yellow,  and  the Japanese  overnight  call rate in green.  In themiddle panel, we  have plotted the  excess reserves in the Japanese bankingsystem.  I talked to Bank of Japan officials  at some  length about  theircalculation  of this measure.  It is  not quite how we would calculate it, but itis the way  they do it.  The chart  illustrates the heightened  generosity that theBank of Japan was practicing by leaving their market in considerablesurplus following  the closure  of Yamaichi  and subsequently  in the last fewdays.  The bottom panel has  two measures  of the Japanese premium indollar interest rates:  the  solid line is the difference  between  the 1-monthLIBOR rates at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi  and at Chase, and the dottedline is  the Fuji rate minus the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi  rate.  There  wassome modest differentiation  among Japanese  names  at the height of thecrisis, but clearly the dominant  difference may be seen in the comparisonbetween  the best Japanese name and Chase as shown in this  example.12/16/97Going back to the top panel, I would like to draw  out two points.  Oneis  that in  the last few  days the Bank  of Japan has  pushed the  overnight  callrate down  into the  20 basis point range.  A Bank of Japan  official  has toldme that "you may call this a temporary easing." emphasis  was on "you" because  they were not going  to call it  that out loudquite yet.  But clearly, they have pushed  the overnight call  rate down.  Thegap between the  purple line showing the current LIBOR and the  orange  linedoes tend to indicate  that the current premium  is expected to wash out on theother side of the fiscal  year.  That is, the high premium,  high demand  forfunds coming out of the Japanese banks  is thought by the market to besomething that will wash out 9-months  forward when  we get happily to theother side of the Japanese  fiscal year-end  in March.I took that to mean  that theTurning to  the third page,  I thought  I would give a little  background  onevents in East Asia.  I know Ted Truman will be speaking  more about that.The main purpose  of these panels  is to remind us that this is not just a badthunderstorm  but  something more  like the  100-year flood.  The top panelshows the exchange  rate movements  since July  1;  the middle  panel haspercent  changes  in equity indices;  and the bottom  panel depicts  1-monthinterest rates.  Focusing on the currency panel,  I think it's easy to say thatthe currencies  have overshot  their fundamental  values.  But I think it'simportant to recognize that there is still  a very large position overhangweighing  on these exchange  markets.  In effect,  a leveraged  convergencetrade as we would have called it in Europe a few  years  ago, short dollar oryen external  currencies  and long internal  currencies,  was embedded on thebalance  sheets of businesses throughout the region,  and they have  not yetcompleted hedging those  exposures.  In these thin markets, both bankers  andtraders  have a very hard time thinking of these  currencies  as  having overshotbecause  they are aware  of how much more there is yet to hedge that isweighing  on the  exchange rate.A second inference  I would draw from this page is to note that thedownward  slope of the foreign  exchange and equity  values is somewhatsteeper than the upward slope in the  1-month  interest rates  at the bottom.Another point I would note is that so far Taiwan,  the red line,  has managedto distinguish itself.  In the top panel  you can see  that its currency  haspanel, you can see that their equity market  has really broken  out of the pack.While looking at this chart overall, I think it is possible  that we will lookback and  see that the end-of-year  effect  for some of these  currencies  andvalues  provided something  of a nadir for them, given the risk aversion  thatis  generally typical  at this time of year.  But I think it would be risky tocount on a bounceback  after the New  Year  for all of them.12/16/97Turning to the fourth page,  I have  depicted  in the top panel both thehave  traded throughout the fall.  There is relatively little net change  in boththose  series from just prior to the November meeting to today.  The middlepanel shows the U.S.  Treasury constant  maturity yields  for 30,  10 and 2years.  You can see  that we have  had a  continued decline in bond yields  inthe 30-  and  10-year areas,  while the yield on the 2-year note has been moreor less flat over that  time horizon.  Clearly, this is something that is quitedifficult to interpret.  I think that with the  worsening of the Asian crisis,and more of them have  come to  adopt the deflationist  outlook or at least  aretaking it more  seriously than they did some time ago.  While point estimatesfor inflation  have moved down  a bit, I think the better explanation  is thatprobability distribution,  that is,  the risk that inflation will rise over the nextsix months.  That  is what is tending to bring down the yield  curve incombination  with the flight-to-quality, end-of-year  effect,  making marketparticipants  more comfortable  about moving their duration  out the yieldcurve in  this end-of-year  environment.The last page of charts relates to our open market operations  in thisperiod.  The top panel covers daily fed funds  trading:  the blue lines show thedaily ranges, the vertical  red lines show the  standard deviations,  and thehorizontal  red lines indicate  the effective rates.  The panel  at the bottom hasthe level of free  reserves  and  indicates our daily misses from the projections.I should point out that at the start of the  middle period,  which includedThanksgiving, we raised  the allowance for excess reserves  from $1 billion to$1.4  billion.  The demand for excess reserves  clearly has been inching up.  Ido not want to suggest that this  is a precise science,  but we are trying to geta handle on  how much it has drifted up.  I think it will be some while beforewe are  confident that  we know where it has  settled.  We had some volatilityaround the Thanksgiving  holiday and the start of December.  As you cansee,  excess reserves  averaged  around $2  billion in that period,  and we stillhad a slightly firm funds rate.  We may have  slightly overcompensated  atthe beginning of the current maintenance  period, but the market was quitetight.  Yesterday was  a corporate tax payment date,  and we tried to preparethe market for that.We purchased  a total of $15.6  billion on an outright basis since the lastFOMC meeting  and a total of  $17.2  billion since  early November.  Thetotal  included  a small amount  of bills, $1.5  billion, and those purchasesseemed to go quite  well.  I was trying to leave  something of a marker withthe market  and the Treasury--a notice  that we were not forgetting about thebill sector, that  we plan to come back to it.  In making these permanent12/16/97reserve  injections,  we did change our pattern  of operations from last year.  Ayear ago, we left  a larger need in  the market, but we reverted to ourtraditional  pattern this year by adding  a large amount  of permanent  reserves.That may put us in a position of having  to drain reserves  to a modest extenttoward the end  of January  when the Christmas demand  comes out of theoperating balances,  but I think we are ready to handle  the effects of being onthe drain  side at what are  likely to be  new lows in operating  balances.We had no  foreign operations  in this period.  Mr. Chairman,  I will needthe Committee's ratification of our domestic  operations,  and I would behappy  to answer any  questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The Southeast Asian exchange  rate patterns imply, asyou say, that a lot of market  participants  are overshooting the fundamentals  in a certain  sense.  Itis difficult  to avoid that sort of conclusion.  We cannot  get a 40 or  50 percent  decline in  anexchange rate  in a short period  of time under any realistic  assumptions  concerning what haschanged.  Stock prices can do that.  They  reflect net  long positions,  and if everyone  decides  topull out,  stock prices will go to zero.  But exchange  rates  are zero-sum games;  one person's riseis  another person's  decline.  So, this exchange  rate decrease  looks extraordinarily  large.  Youraised a question  when you  stated that the balance  of foreign  currency positions  is stilleffectively  long in local currencies  and  short in dollars or perhaps yen.  One would assume thatforward  positions  in the currency, if they  exist, would be able to pick this up.  I have never seen9-month or  1-year forwards  on baht/dollars.  Do they exist?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  They exist.  They are  quite thinly traded,  and I'm not sure how muchconfidence  people  put in them, but they are there.  They are not the kind of market instrumentsthat one can click on a Reuters  page and  see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  But the question is whether  they give us at least apartial  answer.  If we  are getting  extreme disequilibrium,  the deep  forward positions  ought to be12/16/97 6closer to minus  10 or minus  15  as distinct  from minus 40.  And if we cannot infer it from theseother positions, we could in  principle handle  the credit risk  in this situation--I haven't thoughtthis through--by  focusing on the spot rate adjusted  for covered  interest rate  differentials  to giveus an idea  of the forward  position.  I wonder whether we  know anything  about the more distanthorizon in order to answer the question about overshooting,  so to speak, in the adjustment ofbalances.  If indeed those balances  are precisely  what you say, namely,  that they are  comprisedof long positions  in the local currency  and  short positions in dollars,  that imbalance  would giveus a very significant  premium on the forward  position vis-a-vis  the  spot.  It would be veryinteresting to test that if the information  is at all available.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Are  you not just as likely to see  higher short-term interest rates, so infact it would go the other way?  The forward  foreign exchange  rates  would be more depressed.You use the word  position, which  is quite different--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I'm thinking  of 2-year  forwards,  for example.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  I don't think you can  find 2-year forwards  in these  markets.  If theyexisted, they would tend to have  higher interest rates and  would be more  depressed  than thecurrent spot rates.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think the problem  is that we do not have  a time horizon  where oneought to find fundamental  value.  There is not enough confidence  in markets that one  wouldwant to have a contract  with a maturity of that length.  That is a long duration exposure to takeon a currency  that is  declining  so rapidly now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Before the Southeast  Asian markets  collapsed,  we usedto talk about the ability of the Koreans  to fund long-term debt more  readily than short-term,12/16/97 7which goes against  everyone's  view of the  way the world works.  Was  that true then or was itjust an  illusion?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I don't know.  I have not heard that story.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If it was true, it would be an indication  that there is apremium  in a longer forward exchange  rate.  This is a crucial question because  the adjustment iseither  going to implode  down to minus  80 percent or it is going to run into downside resistance.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Peter Fisher may want  to comment, but I think it is reasonable  to saythat many people  want to cover their positions.  There are a lot of different ways  of coveringthem.  Some covering  can be done in the spot market;  some in the forward  market;  somethrough borrowing;  and  some through  lending.  How it manifests itself in individual cases  maybe quite  different.  If you have thin markets,  this continuing  activity may be depressing  spotexchange  rates and you  may get some bounceback even  though the whole process  has not playeditself out because basically  no one is in a position to provide forward cover.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think what we are  seeing is  the implosion of the intermediationprocess in  these exchange  markets.  The exchange  markets for the won and the baht havedisappeared.  There  are not a lot of people who are excited about participating  in those markets.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It  will be  fascinating  to watch  what happens.  It's likethe  tide coming in for the first time in 20 years,  and we find all the junk on the  shore that wedidn't know  existed.  This is partly what is going on in the financial system.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Also, if and when confidence  is restored orwhen greed overcomes  fear, people may suddenly  find that they are much better off to keep  a lotof those  positions that they now want to get out of.12/16/97

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If this thing turns,  it can turn on a dime.  The trouble is,it cannot turn on a baht.  [Laughter]  President Parry, bail me  out!

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Neither won!

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  A question  about Yamaichi:  It was closed on the 23rd  of November,and I guess they ceased being  a primary dealer on  December 4th.  Could you talk a little aboutwhat our financial  relationships with them were just before  the 23rd  and then between  the  23rdand the 4th?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We had been  monitoring  their trading exposure  to us rather  carefullyfor many, many months.  We  had an arrangement  where  if they needed  to elevate their demandfor financing in our RP operations  from the agreed  routine  amount, they would call  SandyKrieger  and give us some  advance notice  and information to  enable us to understand  their need.The process  of getting  a resignation  letter from them was really  a formality.  The lag can beattributed to all the things they had to do other than  type out a letter and  send it to us, but I thinktheir management  understood that was something  they would  have to do  in the course  of windingup their affairs.  Was that helpful?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Anyone  else?  Would somebody like to move to ratifythe  Domestic Desk operations?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank  you.  Without  objection,  they are  approved.This is a  very short agenda.  Messrs.  Prell and Truman please.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you.  Anticipating that, as last month, the focus  ofyour interest  this morning is on  the international  side, I will try again to be12/16/97brief.  I thought,  however, that  I would  offer  a few  remarks on some  of thetougher calls we  had to make on the domestic  side  of our forecast--namelythose  relating to the outlook for wages,  the  stock market,  and capitalspending.Before  that, however, just a few words  on this morning's  statistics:The  CPI--total  and core--increased  just 0.1  percent  in November.  Thetwelve-month  changes  were  1.8  percent for the  total CPI and  2.2 percent  forthe core--the total a tenth below  our Q4/Q4 forecast and the  core right on it.Housing  starts rose  slightly further last month.  We had expected  adropback.  Most  of the  upside  surprise was  in the lower value  multifamilysegment,  which  held at  a high level.  For what it's worth, I  am told that thistax breaks  on  low-income housing  projects.  We'll have to  look into thatfurther.  Single-family  starts were up  a little, but permits  were  down,  so thismore important  segment  looks broadly  in line with our prediction  offlatness.Now  back to my main theme,  some  of the tougher issues  in theprojection.  The first I noted  was  the outlook for wages.  As you  know,  wehave  forecast that wages  and  total compensation  will  decelerate  slightly inthe next year, in the face  of continued low unemployment.  We certainly  arenot arguing  that the labor market is  not tight.  We have  heard the  anecdotesand read  the surveys,  as you have, and  we are persuaded  that finding  andretaining  qualified workers  is a major problem  for employers.  While  manyfirms continue  to report that they will do just about anything they  can  toavoid raising their wage bills--including  even  forgoing expansionopportunities--wage  increases  have been  creeping  up for a while now.My  gut  tells me that the pressure is building in  this labor market pot towhere the lid could blow  off.  But, for better or worse,  our forecast  has  notbeen  shaped by this visceral sensation.  In particular,  we have given  majorweight to the observations  that wages  are rather inertial  and  that they can  besignificantly  affected  by perceived  trends  in prices.  And,  at this point,workers  and employers  are looking  at very  low inflation  over the  past year,and they should be seeing  more of the same for  a while longer,  givenconditions  in goods  markets.  The net result in  our forecast is  still  a heftyfurther  rise in real wages  and  a marked increase  in the  labor  share of theincome pie--but  not an upward  wage-price  spiral.Another tough call relates to the  stock market  outlook.  As  you know,in light of our reassessment  of the prospects  for inflation,  we  haveeliminated  our prior assumption  of an increase in the  federal  funds rate.  We12/16/97had viewed  that tightening  as  an important  trigger for  a marked downturn  inthe market  in the  first half of next year.  The question before  us, then, waswhether  disappointing  corporate earnings  alone could be  expected toproduce  a significant correction before  long.  Our answer was yes, but thatthe  decline will likely be more gradual  and  smaller overall--about  15  percentfrom  yesterday's close by early  1999.  Question marks remain,  however.To date, individual  companies  or industries  have been  punished for badearnings  announcements,  but this  seemingly has occasioned merely  arotation  to other sectors  by  determined  equity investors.  So, could thea while.  Certainly, on  our numbers,  aggregate  year-on-year profitcomparisons  will not begin to  look really poor until next summer or fall.That  said, though, I think there is the distinct possibility that,  once thedeterioration of profits  comes  clearly into view, the market could  developeven more downward  momentum than we have  anticipated.  I would notethat we are  currently projecting  a low for the Wilshire 5000 in  1999 thatwould only take  it back to where  it was this spring  and leave price-earningsmultiples at historically high levels.  A combination  of revised earningsexpectations  and  any further increase  in the  equity premium  from whatprobably  has  occurred  recently would point to a much more  sizable decline,unless interest rates were to fall appreciably  at the  same time.Finally, a  few thoughts on the outlook for business investment.  This isa sizable sector and  one that has provided a lot of propulsion  for theexpansion to date.  We have forecast a significant  deceleration  in capitalspending,  and while this  gets a little circular,  it fits well with our predictionsof rising equity capital costs  and decelerating  output.  However, most of theindications at this point are that investment plans are  very strong going into1998.  For example, the  semi-annual  survey of the National Association  ofPurchasing Managers  indicated that manufacturers  are expecting toincrease their capital  expenditures  next year by  15 percent--an  even greaterincrement than they reported for this  year.  The NFIB's November  survey ofsmall  firms  also showed extremely upbeat investment plans.These  surveys underscore  the risk that investment will,  yet again, provestronger than we have  gauged.  But, there  is some reason  to doubt theirpredictive power  in the present case.  For one  thing, even if the surveys aremerely  a few weeks old, they may still be providing  pretty stale readings.Just looking at how our own changing perception  of the internationaloutlook has altered  our GDP projection over the past few weeks, it seemsreasonable  to think that businesses  are  also reassessing  their plans  and thatmany of them will be trimming  their investment budgets.  If we are  wrong,12/16/97that  does raise  the question of whether  this capital  spending boom won'tcome to  a more jarring end sometime  down the road, with firms findingthemselves  with excess capacity  and experiencing  a deeper hit to profits.So, to sum up, we think we have  provided a realistic  baseline  forecast,but there is  still plenty to puzzle over--and  perhaps  to worry  about from apolicy standpoint.  On that comforting note, let me now turn the  floor overto Ted, who has been  doing a lot of worrying lately.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Our message  about the international  economy and theexternal  sector of the U.S.  economy is straightforward  and easilysummarized:  We  have a weaker outlook for net exports, primarily  as aconsequence  of the further  deterioration of economic and financialconditions in Asia.  While  I am tempted  to  stop at this point and turn toquestions,  there may be a bit more that I usefully can add.  It is true that weare  again projecting  slower global growth,  in particular  in  Asia.  We also  areprojecting a stronger dollar and lower  oil prices;  the  first is  associated to aconsiderable  degree,  though not entirely, with Asian  developments,  butthose developments  have only marginally  affected  our view  of oil prices.Finally, we have updated  our worse-case  scenario, and  I will say a fewwords about our  current thinking  on that  subject.With respect to the current quarter, we have  very little hard data onU.S. international  transactions;  trade data for October will not be  releaseduntil Thursday.  However,  we have written  down  a small negativecontribution of net exports to GDP growth this quarter, in contrast with asmall positive contribution  in the November  Greenbook.  This estimate  isbased primarily upon  three considerations:  first, our assessment of thethird-quarter  data that revealed  somewhat weaker exports than we hadanticipated;  second,  a judgment that the unexpected  strength  in our exportsduring the  first half of this year was coming largely  from an  acceleratoreffect  on exports  of capital  goods that has waned  with the Asian crisis; andthird, anecdotal  information, for example,  from the Beige  Book and thesupplementary reports received from Reserve Banks about the  apparentnegative effects  of the Asian  crisis  on trade flows this quarter.  Theanecdotal  information,  in turn, is consistent with our prior assessment thatthe first-round  effects of the Asian crisis  on our trade will be  felt soonerrather than later.Turning to our forecasts  for 1998  and  1999,  our aggregate projection  ofgrowth in the  rest of the world,  weighted by U.S. nonagricultural  exports, isnow 2-1/2 percent next year and 3-1/4 percent the following  year, comparedwith a trend rate of around 4 percent.  Most of the downward  adjustment isfor the  developing  economies  in Asia, where we anticipate  greater near-term12/16/97weakness  and a more protracted  return to trend.  We have  also marked downslightly further our growth forecast  for Japan, while that for the otherindustrial  economies  is essentially unchanged.Our outlook for Japan  and the other industrial countries has beenaffected by our revised  view of dollar exchange  rates.  As Peter Fisher hasreported,  the dollar strengthened against both the yen  and the continentalEuropean currencies  during the intermeeting  period.  We attribute the yen'sweakness to continuing question  marks hanging  over the Japanese economyand financial  system--questions  marks  that we  do not expect  will beremoved by the announcement,  now postponed until tomorrow,  of yetanother package  of policy measures.  Because  we do not expect underlyingconditions  in Japan to improve immediately  or  dramatically and because weanticipate  that the effects  of Asian developments  will prevent a furthersubstantial expansion  of the Japanese external  surpluses  in the aggregate, wehave  incorporated  into our projection  only a slight appreciation  of the yen/dollar rate  from its recent level.  Compared  with our September projection,we now have  the yen more than  15  percent weaker  at the end of 1999.With respect to continental  Europe,  we  are no longer expecting  afurther  increase in German official  interest rates  prior to the start ofmonetary  union, and  the market appears  to be gradually coming  around tothe same conclusion.  This has contributed to the weakness  of the DM andits  associated  currencies,  and we expect  that recent lower exchange ratesagainst the dollar will persist, on balance,  over the forecast period.  We  alsoanticipate  in our forecast  that sterling  will depreciate  somewhat  against thedollar as U.K. economic  growth and interest rates ease but that the Canadiandollar will  strengthen  somewhat as interest  rates continue to rise in Canada.With respect to the currencies  of non-G-10  countries,  in particular inthe  Asian region,  our crystal ball is murkier.  The Asian currencies,  exceptfor those of China  and Hong Kong,  have declined substantially  further overthe  intermeeting period.  We are not expecting further depreciation,  onbalance,  from the current  highly depressed  levels, nor are we expecting arecovery.  To borrow  a term  from the politics of 1884, I would characterizethis as a mugwump position with regard to the nominal  exchange rates ofthese  economies--our mug is on one  side of the fence  and  our wump is  onthe  other.  However,  real  dollar exchange  rates of these countries  shouldappreciate somewhat  due to inflation  rates that in many cases will  approachor exceed double  digits.The  net result of these  assumptions is that the dollar is stronger in  bothreal and  nominal terms  throughout the forecast period  against both G-10  and12/16/97non-G-10 currencies,  with an  associated negative  impact on our outlook fornet exports.Turning to oil prices, we  have reduced our assumption  about  the priceof imported oil by about $2  per barrel in  1998  and  1999.  Our revisedassumption is based  on the substantial  increase  in official  OPEC  quotas(which has led us to boost our projection  of OPEC  production  by 900,000barrels  per day in  1998),  the easing--at least for the moment--of tensionswith Iraq and  Iran, and  the slowing  of global growth, especially in Asia.The market  appears  to have adopted  a more cautious  interpretation  of thesedevelopments.  Although  futures prices  have  declined, the implieddownward  adjustment in import prices over the forecast period is  about halfthe  size embodied in our assumption.  We believe that the difference reflectsprimarily continuing concerns  about the  availability  of supply from Iraq  and,perhaps,  a different  assumption about the increase in  actual  OPECproduction--in  particular by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United ArabEmirates--under  the new  quotas.In terms of our overall forecast,  lower  oil prices,  of course, imply  lowerU.S.  inflation.  The principal impact  on our external  forecast  is with respectto  the nominal  balances:  Our assumption of lower oil import pricestranslates  into a projected  reduction in the  value of U.S.  oil imports in  1998and  1999 of about $7 billion a year compared with the NovemberGreenbook.  Lower oil prices  have only marginal  effects  on net exports  inreal terms, boosting real imports slightly.In total, the estimated drag from  the external  sector in the DecemberGreenbook  is about 0.9 percentage point over the four quarters  of 1998  and0.4 percentage  point during  1999.  As  a rough approximation,  the dragfrom net exports  would be a bit less than half this  amount in the absence  ofthe  effects of the Asian crisis  and the weaker  outlook for Japan  and the yen,using the September Greenbook  as the basis for comparison.  I wouldcaution, however,  that it becomes increasingly  difficult to disentangle  causesand effects in successive  forecasts.  For example,  in the case of effects thatare transmitted  through third countries,  establishing the counterfactualassumption is problematic.  As  an illustration, in the  November andtrajectories  for monetary policies in  the major foreign  industrial countries aswell as  in the United States,  and these assumptions  have affected  ourthinking about the path for the dollar.  No doubt some, but probably  not all,of these adjustments can and  should be attributed to the generally weakerglobal  outlook and in particular to the effects  of the Asian crisis, but it isincreasingly  tenuous to try to separate out how much is due  to developmentsin Asia and how much is due  to other underlying factors.12/16/97Some of the same  qualifications  apply to the interpretation  ofalternative  scenarios.  For this  meeting, we  have updated  and circulated tothe Committee  a "worse  case"  scenario  for the global  economy in which thealready seriously affected  Asian economies  experience  deeper  and moreprolonged recessions  and less recovery in their real exchange  rates.  In thisscenario,  the crisis  also spreads  in a major way to China  and Hong Kong,and it impacts with greater ferocity  on Latin  America, Eastern  Europe, andthe countries  in the area  of the former Soviet  Union.  On our assumptions,such a worse case would further reduce the  growth rate of U.S. real  GDP byabout a  half percentage  point next year and about a quarter point in  1999,compared  with the Greenbook forecast,  with comparable effects  on otherindustrial economies.  An important  qualification  to this analysis  is that itassumes  that the authorities,  in particular  those in the major industrialcountries, would respond  under the  hypothesized circumstances  by takingappropriate  countercylical  actions, primarily in the area  of monetarypolicy--that  is, they would lower interest rates.  As I noted earlier,  inpreparing  our Greenbook  forecasts,  we  have already incorporatedassumptions  that go in this direction;  we are no longer assuming muchmonetary  tightening.  It is another matter, some might  argue,  to assume thatpolicymakers  will act aggressively  and on a timely basis to damp  a globalslowdown  in growth that is having  differential effects  on their economies.Policymakers  in Europe, preoccupied  with the  transition to monetary union,might be less than poised to take prompt, decisive action.  On the otherhand,  this alternative  scenario  is one that combines both lower inflation andlower  growth, which  would facilitate  easing  action, at least  in the area  ofmonetary  policy.Although our revised worse  case scenario  is possible, and you mighteven  see it in February  as our base case,  I do not believe at this point thatthis scenario is the most likely outcome.  No doubt, Asian financial  marketsand economies  will continue  to experience  substantial downs  and ups  forsome  months, but my view of the  situation is one of optimism combinedwith realism.  I am optimistic that the political  leaders in  Asia, on balance,are  acting  and will continue  to act constructively  to stabilize  their economiesand  financial systems  and that the  support they receive from theinternational  financial community  will help to bridge the gap untilconfidence  in their policies  and underlying economies  returns.  On the  otherhand,  it is  clear that the crisis  is not over, and there is plenty of scope  foradditional  errors or negative surprises.Mr. Chairman,  I will conclude our presentation  on that note.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions for either  gentleman?12/16/97

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Ted, on the  worse  case  scenario,  do you  have  any  sense of whatprobability  you would put on that given  what  you know now?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  I am never quite  sure how to answer those questions  aboutprobabilities,  but I would guess  a fifth  or something like  that.  How  seriously should  we  take thatscenario?  I would say moderately  seriously.  This is  not a meltdown  scenario  because  it assumesthat action  will be  taken by others to prevent  a meltdown.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I was  going to ask Al's question, but  I will ask a  follow-up.  Is therea better case?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Yes,  I think there is.  That's partly  because we  are in  December andthis crisis  has been  going on  for some time.  As Peter said,  we  have  the  sense of a flood ratherthan  a severe  rainstorm.  The psychology  is pretty  gloomy, though one might  say it has  beenslightly less gloomy  in the last couple of days.  It is  slightly less so  only with respect  to  Korea,not with  respect  to any of the  other countries.  But there  is a  scenario in  which we could  have arebound in that situation.  For example,  their exchange  rates  could move back up in  nominalterms--we are  assuming essentially  that they will not--and the global  economies  could pick upfaster than we  anticipate.  I think this  scenario  is equally  likely, though  I would argue that it isnot completely  symmetrical.  I think a better case  would be associated  with a series  of the  rightpolicy steps in the right order, rather than  two  steps forward  and one step  back as  is often  thecase in these  situations.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  When you say it is not symmetrical,  do you mean the  better case  hasa lower probability?12/16/97

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  No, I would say the better case  has the same probability,  but itprobably is not as  good  as the worse case is bad.  We have  a somewhat skewed  distribution  inthat regard.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Ted,  I have a  question  about China and Hong Kong.  In early  1994,China abolished  its official  foreign exchange rate,  and I guess that produced  a depreciation  ofabout 40 percent in their currency.  That obviously  had  an adverse impact on the relativecompetitive position of Southeast Asian countries.  The real appreciation of the  Southeast Asianand Chinese  currencies  since early  1994 and the  problems in their banking systems  led lastsummer to depreciation of their currencies and  related capital outflows.  We now have China'srelative position very adversely  affected by foreign exchange developments.  What adjustment islikely to occur in China and Hong Kong?  China's currency  is not convertible but  I guess therecould be capital flight out of Hong Kong.  In fact,  we could get a depreciation  of both currencies.It seems to me  there is  the possibility of a rather  significant adjustment in these areas, and we donot seem to be  focusing on that.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That possibility certainly is incorporated  in the worse case  scenariowe  have laid out, though the effect may not be as big as some would argue  it could be.  Let mego back to one  of your premises.  Although there was  a 40 percent  adjustment in China's  officialexchange  rate in  1994, most of China's trade--some  80 percent  of it--was  already beingconducted  at the unofficial  exchange rate.  So,  although the  sign certainly was right, we, unlikesome commentators,  do not think the depreciation was  a major cause of all these developments.Moreover  it came in early  1994, not in 1997.  The Chinese  financial  system is very weak  and has12/16/97 17many of the  same problems,  if not worse,  as the  financial systems  in these  other economies.  Theimportant  difference  is that the Chinese financial  system is not as  integrated  into the worldfinancial  system  so it is not a major source  of external weakness.  It may be  a source of internalweakness,  but one  can debate  that point.  Clearly,  it is not the same  source  of external  weaknessthat we  find in  some of these other countries.That having been said, there certainly  is scope for continuing  capital flight fromChina.  I know some  analysts, including  colleagues  on my staff, who estimate that capital  flighton the order of $10  billion a year probably  is occurring  today from Mainland  China.  It isdisguised  in the trade account  and  so forth and there are  errors and  omissions in the data.  Therecertainly is plenty of money in that economy  and there always  are ways of getting it out, thoughthat may require some  patience.  In my view,  the  Chinese authorities  have taken  a fairlyresponsible and nuanced  position to date  with regard to the yuan.  In fact, at the meetings thisweek in Kuala Lumpur they basically said that they were  not going to devalue their exchangerate, but they  also indicated that they were not going to go out of their way  to help neighboringnations financially  any more  than they already were.  As  you know, they have  a fairlycomfortable international  reserve position  of well over  $130  billion--the  latest number  that Iremember seeing.  So,  there is a risk there.  Setting aside the Chairman's  view about thepossibility  of a downward  limit to declines in other  Asian exchange  rates,  which seems to beright to me, there  is a point at which the competitive pressures  on China and the differentcompetitive pressures  on Hong  Kong  would be felt.  Therefore,  I think we cannot rule out thepossibility  that that pair of dominoes, to use an  old metaphor, could  affect other Asian economiesand likely have  a  secondary ripple effect  on the  United States  and other parts  of the world.  That12/16/97 18is a risk,  though if I were to  assess the risks, I think there  is a higher probability  of a problem  inBrazil  associated in the  short run with  a spread  of the Asian disease  and a  lower probability  of aproblem  in Mainland  China and  Hong  Kong.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  It seems to  me that,  without getting into specific  probabilities,  if onewere  constructing  another worse  case, Brazil  would be  an interesting  dimension to add to it.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It  is in this  scenario;  it just may not  be in the outline  that we sent toyou.  We assumed  that the Hong  Kong  peg goes and,  as I remember,  that economic growth inChina drops  from  essentially 4 or 5 percent  to zero or close to it next year and similarly  in HongKong.  That  aspect of the scenario  could be worse,  if you want  to put it that way, and in somesense it is just illustrative  of what would be happening.  Any of these developments  could be

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Okay, thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions for these  two gentlemen?  If not,do  you want to start the go-around?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I will not commentto any degree  on the economy  of the Second  District, which  actually is a little better than it wasat the time  of our last meeting, nor  on the  national economy because  we agree essentially  withthe viewpoint  of the Greenbook.  Since  I have  spent a little more than four decades  on theinternational  side of things,  I thought  I would devote some  comments  to my feel  for the politicaland economic  situation  in the world.  My views  are not significantly  dissimilar from those  thathave just been shared.12/16/97It  seems to  me that the world economy is walking  along  a rather narrow  ridge.  To theright, we have  a pleasantly  upward  sloping meadow  and  to the left,  a rather  large precipice.  Theforecast essentially  has the world economy continuing to  walk successfully  along that ridge.  It isnot very likely to begin to enter the meadow  and experience  better conditions  nor is it likely tofall into  the precipice.  What are the dangers?  If we look at the three  economies  in Asia thatalready  are in  the hands  of the International  Monetary Fund--Korea,  Thailand,  and Indonesia--wesee that even  though they are  very  different in many  ways, they all have  command economies  inwhich resources  are  allocated by  politicians and bureaucrats  and  not by the  marketplace.  Thetool  that the politicians  and bureaucrats  have used  to allocate resources  has been  the financialsystem, and  the financial  systems  in all these countries  are extremely  weak.  The process ofallocating  resources  by politicians  and bureaucrats  through the banking system means  that acountry  does not produce  good bankers  and it does  not produce good bank supervisors.However,  the leaders  of these countries  have had  very long records of success.  Accordingly,  it isvery  difficult for them to believe  that the  leadership they have  provided, which has takenadvantage  of some very  real virtues--such  as very  high saving  rates and tremendous  investmentin education  that have created a dedicated,  hardworking,  and well-educated  labor force--hassuddenly become  wrong.  They really  were not wrong  during that long period of success.  Whatthey  miss is that the world has changed, just  as a number  of years  ago the  leaders  of the SovietUnion missed  that the  world had changed.The  command economy  simply does  not work today  in a more integrated  world withvery rapid technological  developments.  That means that the leaders  in those countries  do notunderstand,  either emotionally  or intellectually,  how the new economy in which  they must12/16/97 20operate now  functions.  This  is where there is a  great deal of confusion  that leads  to equatingthese Southeast Asian situations  with that of Mexico  in  1994  and  1995.  The  differences  are  thatMexico  has had political leadership  that very  deeply understands how  a market economybehaves;  it has had  the good luck of having a president  who is an outstanding  economist  andunderstands  markets very well  and, after a short  adjustment period, it  has had  an outstandingfinance  minister who  also understands  very well how markets  work; it has  a much better, moreexperience  with hardship and thus has the ability to  adjust to this new hardship  with patience.Therefore,  the Mexican  economy,  with some very creative  help from the United States  and theInternational  Monetary  Fund, improved  rather quickly.  It began to turn upward in March andcan have great  confidence that the  same favorable  outcomes  will prevail  in Korea, Thailand,  andIndonesia.Among the other countries  in Southeast Asia, Malaysia certainly  has a very similareconomy,  but I think it is involved  in an  advanced exercise  in denial.  Even  countries that havemanaged  themselves  particularly well,  Hong Kong  and Singapore,  are being  battered, as theSingapore dollar was  today, by people who view them  as command  economies.  They have beenmuch better managed, certainly  in  the case of Singapore  with a very  high degree  of integrity atthe official  level, but they are  still regarded  as command  economies  that may have  the sameproblem in adjusting to the real  world.The Chinese leadership,  as Ted Truman  suggested, has thus  far behaved extremelywell.  Overnight, the  spokesman  for Jiang  Zemin, the chairman  and  president, said that they12/16/97 21would not  devalue  their currency.  Their vice premier  for economic  management,  Zhu Rongji,who is generally  deemed  to be  the premier-to-be,  provides very  effective  leadership  especiallyconsidering  that he has lived  all  of his  life in a command  economy that is  still under  CommunistParty leadership.  He understands  rather well  how  the world economy  works.  One  can  hope thatChina will not add  to the  problems  by making some  unfortunate policy mistakes.  As PresidentParry  suggested  in his questions,  the  temptations certainly  are  there.The major command  economy in  Asia is that of Japan.  It is after all the Japanesemodel  that Korea  followed.  Japan  basically  has the same  structural  problem:  Resources  areallocated  by bureaucrats  and  politicians.one has to hope that certain  steps will  be taken that  recognize that the  way they have beenmanaging  their economy may have  been  grand for a while,  but it no longer  works.If we were to  have a continuing  contagion  from Asia,  I think it is very  likely, again assuggested  by President Parry  in his question and Ted Truman  in his  answer, that the  next countryabout which  one would  have to  worry is Brazil.  The Brazilian  real is overvalued  in  the exchangeexcept  when there is  a feeling  among the politicians  that they are  about to be infected  by Asia.After some improvement in  facing reality  a couple  of weeks  ago when the  Asian  flu seemedparticularly  virulent, there appears  to have been  a return  to politics  as usual.  Fortunately,  Brazilhas a very good government  team at the levels  of the president, the finance minister,  and  thecentral bank  governor.  Argentina  continues  to do  well, but because  of its Mercosur  involvement,it would not be  able to withstand  a shock from Brazil.12/16/97If we  look at Europe, there were dire warnings  at the recent BIS  meeting of thedangers  from Russia.  Every central  bank governor  took us aside--Alice  Rivlin,  Ted Truman,Peter Fisher,  and me--and  said they hoped  we were not concentrating  so much on  Asia and onour own hemisphere  that we were  unaware  of how precarious  the Russian economic  situationwas.  That situation  is exacerbated  somewhat by the most recent  illness  of President Yeltsen.The leadership  that we normally  share with Europe  is adversely affected, though one  shouldnot overstate this, by the fact that they are  heading  into the  most crucial  six-month period for thecreation  of the euro.  The  concentration  of European political  and economic  leaders  is very muchfocused  on their own affairs and that of the United  Kingdom.  Even though the United  Kingdomis going to be an  "out"  initially,  though  an "in"  later, it also  is going to concentrate  on Europeaneconomic  affairs by the historical accident that its prime minister is the president  of the EuropeanUnion for the first six months of next year.Therefore,  it would appear that we have  a world that is not likely  to slide into  theprecipice,  but that risk is  very considerable.  In my view,  what  would bring about such  a slidewould be the implosion  of the financial  systems in  some  of the Asian  countries,  as happened  in anumber of well-developed  economies  in the  1930s.  That is not likely to happen  but it remains apossibility.There  is  a positive side.  As we have  been suggesting,  markets probably haveoverreacted  in relation  to fundamentals.  I think it is less  likely but not at all  impossible that, ifthe Asian financial  systems do not implode,  the markets would  decide that the risk is behind us.there could be a recovery.  The  latter probably would be accompanied  by a certain  amount of12/16/97 23euphoria, which could have  us entering  the meadow  that I described.  There might be  a very bigquestion,  if that happened, about  the degree  of realism that  would accompany the  euphoria andwhether  we would be preparing  ourselves  for an even  more difficult situation a year or two downthe path.In the  middle of all this, the United States should continue  to do rather well,  as  MikePrell and Ted Truman have  suggested  and certainly  the New  York Bank agrees.  Therefore,  Ithink we, the central bank of the United States,  are in the very  fortunate position of being able topursue our primary  long-term goals of sustained economic  growth and price stability.  However,I believe there is a tactical aspect relating to what I have described as  the precipice  on the left.Tactically, I think we  should maintain  an extremely flexible view of what  we need to do, and thatapproach  should characterize  at least our operating  view of our responsibilities  in the comingmonths.  Thank you.

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  the pace of economic  growth in the Twelfth FederalReserve  District remained solid in recent  months, although down  slightly from  its trend  duringthe first half of the year.  Despite  the slowdown,  economic  activity is expanding more  rapidly inmost District states than in the nation  as  a whole.  Employment  growth in the District continuesto outpace  growth  in the labor force,  pushing unemployment  rates  down and  creating very tightlabor markets, particularly  in urban areas.  The District-wide  unemployment rate fell nearly  1percentage  point over the  last twelve months.The generally  positive outlook in the District is tempered  by reports of tight labor12/16/97 24competition  for employees  has become  so fierce that employers  reportedly  are convertingtemporary  part-time jobs to permanent  full-time jobs in  an effort  to attract workers.  Shippingbottlenecks  associated  with  the Union Pacific  rail scheduling  problems  reportedly have causeddelays in deliveries  of both final  and  intermediate  goods,  with the most affected  sectorapparently  being agriculture.Initial  reports from District states  indicate that recent developments  in East  Asia havereduced the demand  for exports  of some commodities,  primarily raw and  processed  agriculturalgoods  and lumber  and wood products.  At this  early stage,  other vulnerable  industries  such  ashigh-tech equipment  reportedly  have  not been  greatly  affected,  although we recently  heard thatMicrosoft  is talking  about some  weakness  as a result of problems in Asia.  Data on  merchandiseexports  indicate that in percentage  terms the Twelfth District  exports  about  twice as much  of itsestimated gross  product to East Asia as  does  the United States  as a whole.  Thus,  the effects  ofrecent developments  in East  Asia on economic  growth likely will be larger in the TwelfthDistrict than in the nation.Turning to  the national  economy,  the data certainly  indicate  that real  GDP growthremains  robust  in the current  quarter and that inflation continues  subdued.  But traditional  macromodels  strongly  suggest that growth will  slow next year.  We expect real  GDP growth  of justabove 2 percent in  1998.  Our pure  model forecast actually  showed a more pronouncedslowdown than this, but  we boosted it a bit to  reflect the effect  of a possible favorableproductivity  shock.  Just to mention  very briefly a couple of the factors behind the projectedslowdown:  First, the  dollar's  appreciation  over the last year and the projected  slowing  in foreigndemand in  1998  certainly  should reduce demand for U.S.  products.  Of course,  both of these12/16/97 25factors  are being reinforced  by recent developments  in  Asia.  In addition, real  short-term  interestrates appear to have  been nudged  up by recent declines in expected  inflation.  I must add,however, that there is plenty of room for skepticism  about  whether  a slowdown  this big willactually occur next year.  Traditional  models have  been incorrectly predicting  slower growth forthe past year and a half.  As I mentioned, it is quite  possible  that economic  activity  is beingboosted to some extent  by a positive productivity  shock, but it is certainly too  soon to tell howmuch of an effect  this factor may be having or how long it may last.With regard to  inflation,  we have  reduced our forecast since  the November  meeting.Certainly,  the continued appreciation  of the dollar  will help to hold down  prices.  Secondly,  theresults  of the last Philadelphia Fed survey  of inflation expectations  were impressive.  The sizabledrop in long-term expectations  provides  an important confirmation  of the evidence  that we haveseen from the inflation-indexed  Treasury  bond market.  And third, recent  productivity data havebeen encouraging,  and it may be reasonable  to build in a modest reduction  in future inflationfrom faster productivity  gains.  There is, of course,  one major  factor that goes in the oppositedirection.  The unemployment rate has continued to fall and is now well below the natural  rate.Given  all these considerations,  we expect  that price  inflation  will hold steady in  1998and  1999  at about this  year's rate.  At our last meeting,  it seemed more likely that there wouldbe some upward tilt to inflation.  I must add,  however, that the risk to this forecast  may beskewed to the upside.  If economic  activity does not slow as much as we expect, labor marketscould tighten  further and  add upward  pressure on inflation.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  economic  conditions in the  Seventh  District are quitesimilar for the most part to what  I reported at our last meeting, but the Asian  situation  has left asense  of greater  uncertainty  about the outlook.  In terms  of consumer  spending, retailers  haveused the  terms "sluggish"  and "soft"  to describe  recent sales trends.  That may be partly  due  towhat  has become  a bimodal holiday  sales season,  with sales relatively  stronger around  Thanks-giving  and the week before  Christmas but weaker in-between.  While it is possible  that we willsee the same  pattern this year, at least one large retailer in  our District has trimmed expectationsfor industry  sales from  a rise of 4 to 7 percent to one of 2 to 3 percent.Light vehicle sales  this month  seem to be tracking around the  15  million unit rateaccording to our contact  at the Big Three who also noted that incentives  are  a very importantfactor in maintaining  sales  at this level.  Overall manufacturing  output in the District has beenexpanding  at about the same pace  as in the nation, but trends are  mixed across  industries.Demand for heavy  trucks has been very  strong, with order books  filled through  the middle ofnext year.  One truck  manufacturer  believes  that there has been  some double ordering,  althoughcancellation  rates have been low thus  far.  A number of District industries  including  steel,cement,  gypsum board, container board,  and housing have  not experienced  as much strength  asseen nationally.In terms  of any impact  from the Southeast  Asian situation, it is  still too soon  to knowall the direct effects  on the region, let alone the indirect effects.  On the export side,  the SeventhDistrict is likely to be directly  affected less than the nation  as a  whole because the SoutheastAsian countries account  for a smaller  share  of our export markets,  a flip side of the situation  inthe Twelfth District that  Bob Parry  was describing.  Contacts  in the  food equipment, paper, and12/16/97 27plastic laminate  industries  already  have  seen  some reduction  in export  orders  to  Asia, but theyalso note that business has been  good  in Europe.  Depreciating  foreign currencies  and  sloweconomic  growth in several  Asian markets  may account for part of the  sluggishness  in  our cornexports, but an  increased supply  from China, Eastern Europe,  and  the former  Soviet Union  maybe a more critical  factor there.On the other side of the trade equation,  auto and steel imports could rise  as  Asianproducers  attempt  to find replacement  markets in the  United States  for their products,  and  thatwould  affect our region relatively more  than the  United States  as  a whole.  One  of our directorsin the  steel industry believes  that steel  imports will surge  and that the  quality of selectedcategories  of imports  will be quite high relative  to the more  common imports from EasternEurope.  Steel  and auto  industry contacts  said  that they were  moving ahead with plans  toaccelerate  their cost-cutting  measures  substantially  over  the next year,  perhaps  spurred in part byprospects  of more intense  import competition.  As  I have been reporting for some time now,labor markets are  very tight in our District, with the unemployment rate  at or below  4 percentsince  May, and we  continue to hear many  anecdotes  of various  ways that firms  are  dealing withworker shortages.Turning to the national  outlook, my view  at the  last several  meetings has been  similarto that  expressed in past Greenbooks.  GDP growth and inflation  could only be  contained bypolicy tightening  in  1998.  The  question now is whether  the  deteriorating international  situationwill have the major consequences  for the U.S.  economy that  the current Greenbook  envisions.Of course it could,  but I don't see the  balance of risks pointing in  that direction.  Considering  thestrength  of the underlying  domestic economy,  we  tend to think that real  GDP growth in  199812/16/97 28will be closer to 2-1/2 percent  than to the  1.7  percent  rate in the  Greenbook.  Our figure  factorsin  a substantial  degree  of pessimism based  on the Asian crisis.  Net exports  subtract about 0.7percentage  point from  1998  GDP growth  in our projection.  Combined  with some  furthercollateral  effects on U.S.  financial markets,  this takes us to the 2-1/2 percent  forecast.  This  is nota worse case  scenario;  it is  our best guess  given  the information  to date.  Regarding  prices,  I, too,am  concerned that the favorable  inflation  shocks  that  we anticipate  from the internationalsituation  in 1998  will  be transitory  and their reversal  will have  to be addressed  later at  a timewhen  action  will be more  difficult.  In summary, I  see the upside risks  for  1998  to besubstantially greater than  the Greenbook  portrays.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall,  it appears  that aggregatedemand  remains relatively  strong in our region,  although  reports  are  a little more mixed thanthey were a month  ago.  Regarding  a couple of the details, general  retail and  service-sectoractivity picked up  sharply  in November  according  to our latest monthly  survey.  However,  wealso heard  a number of reports  of weaker  auto sales  over the course  of the  last several  weeks,  andrecent  anecdotal  reports indicate that housing may be  softening a little from a very  high level.Commercial  real  estate activity,  in contrast, appears  to remain  very  strong, especially  in theWashington  area but generally  around the  District as a whole.  Elsewhere,  manufacturing  activitymoderated  in November  according  to our  survey,  but there is some  evidence  of a firming in thissector so  far in December.  Labor markets--what  can I say?  They are  at least as tight as theyhave  been in our region,  perhaps even  a little tighter than they were if that's possible.  We havereports  of record-breaking  job vacancy  backlogs at a number  of temp agencies.  Labor shortages12/16/97 29apparently are  resulting in some  buildup in  wage  pressures  in at  least some  sectors of theregional  economy, especially  construction and retail.  Typically, seasonal  workers  earn theminimum wage on  average during the  holiday  season.  They are now making $6.00  an hour oreven more  in some  cases.Turning  to the  national picture,  I have to say that I found the  abrupt revisions  in theGreenbook  projections  surprising,  at least their extent.  Actually, this month's real  growth andinflation forecasts  are not all that different from  last month's.  But in this Greenbook,  themoderation in the rate of real  GDP growth  and the containment of inflation take place  withoutany  tightening of monetary policy.  In the November  Greenbook, a significant  tightening wasassumed to occur over the  course of 1998.  I understand, of course, that this change reflects  thepotential  negative  fallout of Asian problems  on the U.S.  economy, but it is not at all  clear to mefrom the discussion in the Greenbook  that in terms  of the most likely  outcome recentdevelopments have  changed  the outlook as  substantially as the projections  indicate.Let me make four observations  about  this very quickly.  First,  at our Novembermeeting I  expressed concern that the widespread view in financial  markets that Fed policy wason hold,  at least for the time being, was preventing  long-term interest  rates from playing theirusual  automatic  stabilizer role.  In my view,  the market reaction  to the November employmentreports  was very  strong evidence  for this point of view and  this concern.  That report was muchstronger than expected.  The strength  was  across the board, and the report included  an hourlyincrease  in wages  that was well above  any reasonable  projection  of productivity gains.  Theus react is a fairly substantial jump in CPI inflation.  With labor markets as tight as  they are,  I12/16/97 30think this absence of the usual  stabilizer mechanism  coming  from long-term interest rates  is  asignificant upside risk in the outlook,  and I believe  that needs to be given considerable  weightalong with whatever weight  we give to the  Asian problem.Second,  a key element  in the Greenbook's  new projections  is the estimate  that theAsian crisis  will double the decline  in U.S.  net exports  in  1998  from what was  projected in thepoint next year.  I don't know  exactly how that estimate  was arrived at.  More  importantly,  I donot have a clear  sense of what the staff would say about the confidence  interval  around thatestimate.  I think it would be helpful to know  that, given the extent of the changes in theprojections,  although Ted's  answer to my question  helps  to put a little more of a  quantitativedimension  on  it.  The basic  point is that net exports clearly present downside  risks, but we needto be careful not to overstate  them when weighing  them against other risks  that we face in theoutlook.  For all of the talk about globalization, the U.S.  economy is  still self-contained  to a veryconsiderable  extent.Third, the  flip side of the prospective  widening of the U.S. current account  deficit is  awidening capital  account  surplus.  The Asian crisis,  as I think we all know, has redirected capitalflows away  from emerging economies  back toward industrial  economies,  especially the U.S.economy.  This is certainly part of the reason  for the recent declines  in bond rates  in U.S.reflow that is  occurring has some  of the effects  of an easing of monetary policy.  I don't think theGreenbook mentions  this, and  I wonder whether  the projections  take  account of it.12/16/97Finally, while  the appreciation  of the  dollar obviously will reduce  export demand,  thateffect will  be partially offset by the restraining  effects of the  dollar's appreciation  on prices.  Thebetter inflation  performance  will bolster real  wage gains in  the U.S.  economy  and probablyincrease household  confidence  that those wage  gains will continue.  That could well keepconsumption  expenditures  on an  above-trend  path and  add further to the tightness  in laborIn short, while events  in Asia  obviously are  serious and present  significant  downsiderisks, the upside  risks that were in  the outlook before the Asian crisis  emerged have  notdisappeared.  We should not discount  them in our assessment  of the outlook.  Thank  you.

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy in the Philadelphia Districtis operating  at  a high level,  with most sectors  doing well.  Labor markets,  as elsewhere,  are  verytight, but inflation remains  subdued  despite some upward pressures  on compensation.  We  talkabout the tight labor markets, but business  people are  doing a lot more than talking about it.They are being rather creative  in terms of attracting people who ordinarily  would  not beavailable to  work.  For example,  along  some  of the  main arteries  in the Philadelphia region, wesee large signs  advertising job  opportunities  at ABC company or XYZ company.  Local  theatersadvertise jobs in their film clips.  Instead  of just getting previews  of the next film, the moviegoergets a  film clip  about working for specific  companies.  Flyers  about available jobs are beingdistributed  at senior citizens'  meetings  and in grocery  stores.  I am told that serious  considerationhas been  given in  some schools  to sending  flyers home  with  school children  to invite theirparents  or other caretakers  to call  a number or come  to a particular place to discuss available12/16/97 32jobs.  The subways,  buses, and  taxis also  are getting advertising  from employers.  So, business isresponding to this labor scarcity  and is exercising  some flexibility in  terms of enticingunemployed people to  accept jobs.  Clearly, there  are limits to this process,  but I think thoselimits  are being pushed back.In the consumer  spending area,  holiday retail sales  seem to be  doing reasonably  welloverall.  However,  one can  get quite a mixed message depending  on whom one  talks to.Competition is fierce,  and  the patterns  of retail  sales are changing.  Sales through  the TVmedium  and catalogue  sales are taking away  some business from traditional retailers.  The largemalls with the more established  stores  seem to be doing well,  whereas  the big box retail  storesand strip malls  tend to be having a tougher time.  We  can get  any story we want depending  onwhom we talk to on any  given day, but if we put it all  together, I think we come  away  with asense  that holiday sales are doing reasonably  well.The commercial  real estate market continues  to tighten  and office vacancy  rates aredropping.  Home builders and real  estate agents  report that demand  for both new  and existinghomes  is quite healthy.  At this point, manufacturers  report some moderation  in demand  andoutput, but they do not point  in particular to the  Asian situation,  although they may well do soover the next  several weeks.We in the Fed  and  other central  banks focus  on inflation  and the goal of price  stability.Being  a good central banker, I always warn people of the risks of inflation and the virtues ofprice stability.  When  I finish that talk, the first  question I get now concerns  what I think aboutdeflation.  In my view,  this deflation talk is  not something one  can just dismiss.  That's mainlybecause  it is coming from fairly sensible  people, the  same people who told us not to worry  a12/16/97 33whole  lot about inflation  in  1996 and  1997 when  we insisted that there  was  a big problem.  Inpart, I believe these comments  are reflecting the  fierce  competition that businesses  face, and theyalso reflect  the fact that most businesses find deflation harmful.  I think they would rather  have  alittle inflation  than a little deflation.  Nonetheless,  while we do not have to buy into it and  wewant to be sure to keep it in perspective,  this is  something that we ought not to dismiss out ofhand as coming from people who are ill-informed.On  the international  side  I want  to compliment President McDonough  on his analysis.It was a very insightful  analysis  of what is  happening  and I appreciate  very much having it.As far as the national  economy goes,  we are  in  an enviable  position in terms ofunderlying  demand  in the economy, in terms of job creation,  and in terms of benign  inflation.There clearly  are risks and we have talked  about those risks for months.  I think  we need  to beflexible  both in our assessment  of where the  risks  lie and what  monetary policy might or mightnot have to do over the  next  12  months  or so.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Sixth District economy continues  toexpand at a moderate  rate.  Tourism remains a real  strength for us, with flights to Florida alreadybooked  up earlier and faster than last year and  with above-average  attendance  at touristattractions  for the holiday period.  In particular,  the influx of tourists  from Latin America isreportedly boosting retail sales  in south Florida.  Hotels, car rental  companies,  cruise lines--allindicate  that current and  advanced bookings  are  strong.  Similar patterns prevail along theMississippi and the Gulf Coast.  Production and new manufacturing orders  have  declinedsomewhat  recently  in our area, according  to both  anecdotal evidence  as  well as our December12/16/97 34regional manufacturing  survey.  However, expectations  are  for a pickup in both production  andnew orders looking six months out.  Not unexpectedly,  orders for textiles  and  apparel  arereported  to be  declining.  Also, the rig count in  the Gulf slipped back a tad in the last month.The picture  for housing has changed  very little since  the last FOMC  meeting.  Homesales remain mixed,  and housing  inventories  are reported  to be in good shape.  Single-familyhome construction  has  been essentially flat and multifamily  construction has begun  to slacken.Occupancy  rates are expected to stabilize  by the first of the year.  As  was the case at the time ofour last meeting,  commercial  real estate  markets  remain healthy, as evidenced by  increases  inboth occupancy  and rental rates.  However, the  industrial real estate  sector has  shown  some  signsof a slowdown.  Overall,  both developers  and real estate  agents remain  optimistic  about theperiod immediately  ahead.With regard to the now familiar  story that everybody is talking  about, labor markets  inour area remain tight.  Reports  of wage increases  have been  occurring  with some greaterfrequency recently.  In certain  hot areas like  Atlanta, finders fees are  being offered to employeeswho recruit family and friends.  Overall, however,  prices generally  are remaining  steady.  Thereare  scattered reports,  some coming from our District manufacturing  survey, of a slight rise inmaterials prices.The impact of Asian problems  on our region does not appear to have been great  todate.  Like President Parry,  we have reports  of citrus shipments, mainly grapefruit,  that are eitherbeing cancelled or are down considerably,  especially to Japan.  Port contacts  in both Miami andNew  Orleans  report some decline  in the overall volume  of shipments  to Asia, while the port  ofSavannah  indicates a slight reduction in shipments  of wood pulp.  The big Georgia Pacific12/16/97 35Company states  that it has seen some slowing  in shipments  of pulp and  paper to the Pacific  rim,but the  company had  expected a seasonal  slowdown in  any case.As for the national economy, the consumer  sector is  a little stronger than we expectedat the time  of the last FOMC meeting.  Because of the deepening  difficulties  in Asia, the foreignsector has been a bit weaker  than we anticipated.  Business investment spending has beenmaintained  at strong levels longer than we had forecast.  I continue  to be  heartened by the goodbalance  we continue  to  see in the  economy and the fact that inflation remains moderate and  isshowing  a slight downward trend.Four developments  have led us to modify our projections:  the  stronger-than-expectedrates of growth in industrial capacity,  and the view  that the weakness in Asian economies  may begreater  than initially was  thought.  As a result, we project  the consumer  sector to be  somewhatstronger, the  international trade  sector somewhat weaker,  and capacity utilization  somewhatlower,  with inflation marginally  more  subdued in the near term.  Both our judgmental  forecastand our VAR policy model suggest that real  GDP growth will be  a bit smoother than thatreflected  in the  Greenbook, with near-term growth  being somewhat lower  and longer-termgrowth  somewhat  stronger but with an inflation  path closer to the Greenbook alternative  with nostock market  decline.  Indeed,  our VAR model, which  does  not consider  the effects of the Asianflu, implies  that if one wanted  to hold the rate of inflation  at about current  levels, a smalltemporary increase  in the federal  funds rate would be necessary  sometime next year.Considering  that to be a warning signal  and in light of my desire  not to  lose the gains we havehad in bringing inflation to  its current level, I regard the likely drag  that the Asian problems12/16/97 36imply for the  economy  as  equivalent to a slight policy tightening, but with a  more immediateshort-run impact on the  real economy,  an outcome that  seems  desirable  at this time.  Projectedresults  should take some of the heat off both production  and labor markets  and may even havethe desirable effect  of taking inflation  down  another notch.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The economy in the Dallas District continues  to  grow considerablyfaster than the nation's.  Growth has remained broad-based  through  all segments  of the privatesector.  The  strongest employment  growth  has been in oil  and gas extraction,  followed by thefinance, insurance,  and real estate  sectors.  The only industry running  at or beyond full capacityis oil and gas  drilling, where supplies of all key inputs have constrained  activity.  A few meetingsago,  I mentioned that  some oil  companies  were  going as far as Great Britain to find machinists.More recently,  we have heard reports of a company  recruiting welders  from India.  In  spite of thesomewhat bearish  outlook for oil prices  over the next year or two, most companies  expect toremain profitable and  are  trying to expand exploration  and production.All  sectors  of the real estate market  remain quite  strong, especially  the industrial andoffice markets.  Both the Dallas and Houston  office  markets  have had falling vacancy  rates  andsteeply rising rents throughout  1997.  In Dallas, it is expected that over  11  million square feet  ofoffice space will  become  available next year.  That is the equivalent  of about  15  Dallas Fedbuildings.  In Houston, plans  for the construction of the first downtown office  tower since  1986have just been announced.  Class A space in Houston's central business district is now about 90percent  occupied.  Prices  of existing homes in Texas are  up 3 percent  year over year, with somemetropolitan  markets  such as  Dallas  showing  gains of more than double that.  The president of12/16/97 37the  largest single-family  real estate agency  in  Dallas told  us that October and November were thetwo best months  in  the  firm's history,  and she expects December  to be  the  same.  Normally, theywould be practically  shut down at the end of the year for the  holidays, but  demand has beenmaking that impossible  this year.Not all sectors  are  this robust.  Employment  has been  weak in  the apparel industry,and the announcement by Levi  Strauss that it will close  three El Paso plants has increased  thelevel  of concern  in that  community.  More recently,  Hasbro  also announced  a plant closing in ElPaso that, together with the big decline in wages  in Southeast  Asia, has begun to underminesome of the confidence  that had been  returning to  the border  economy.  The  last year has notbeen  such a good one for  our manufacturers  of semiconductors,  electronic  equipment, andinstruments.  While they are  anticipating  a better  year in  1998, recent financial turmoil in  Asiahas damped  near-term prospects.At our board  meeting last week,  our director from  the retailing  industry reported  thatChristmas sales  were about on track so  far this season  and that retailers  were  expecting  a "ho-ho"year rather than a "ho-hum"  or a "bah-humbug"  year.  Labor markets remain  extremely tight.Sizable wage increases  are reported for highly  skilled technical  workers.  Salaries  have soared asmuch as $20,000  in the last year for workers  such as  software engineers,  though the more typicalincreases have been in the $7,000  to  $10,000  range.  The greater the shortage, the moreextraordinary are  the measures  taken to find workers.  For example, Intel  is building a chipfactory in Fort Worth and is reported  to have mailed letters to  14,000  engineers  working atcompeting  companies  with offers of a  week-long trip to Hawaii for two if they joined Intel.  Onetelecommunications  company  has been  helping Asian  students to get visas  after graduate school.12/16/97 38Consequently,  11  percent of their  workforce  of 2,500 is Asian.  The company also has begunrecruiting  in Canada.  Another large  Dallas-based firm offers  telecommuting  to engineers  whowish  to live in  Austin and work in Dallas.  To  increase  the future supply of engineers,  a numberof leading  telecommunications  companies including  Motorola, Southwestern  Bell, AT&T,  andTexas Instruments have joined  forces with  several leading  Texas universities  to form the TexasTelecommunications  Consortium, which  will fund research  and educational programs.Turning  to the national  economic outlook, it is clear that the risks have shiftedconsiderably since  the November meeting.  The Greenbook  does a good job of reflecting thisincreased uncertainty,  both on the downside and the  upside.  The  so-called  "worse  case"  scenariois a highly  plausible and unnerving one.  We  must be concerned  that a serious slowing  of worldeconomic  growth would  imperil the ability and  willingness  of countries  in Latin  America,Eastern Europe,  and Asia to continue their transition to more democratic,  market-basedeconomies.This seems to be a  time that calls  for economic  diplomacy on our part  and an excellenttime not to "rock the boat."  Against  the backdrop  of continued  disinflation  stemming from lowerenergy prices,  a stronger dollar,  and plenty of domestic and worldwide industrial  capacity,  theinflation risks  seem small indeed  and may be shifting rapidly toward the other end of thespectrum.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, the New England  region continues  its recent trend ofsolid growth, low unemployment  relative  to that for the nation, tight labor markets,  but onlymoderate price  and wage  pressures.  There are  exceptions  in specific job categories  where12/16/97 39workers  are  in extremely  short  supply, especially in information technology  and engineering.Like Atlanta,  the First District is experiencing  a boom in tourism.  We, too, have  some largemanufacturers  who are  concerned  about deflation  as  in the Philadelphia region.  But my sense isthat their concern  reflects a  long period of very  strong  competition within  their industries ratherthan  any real expectation  that the economy will experience  broad-based  reductions in  prices  andwages.While it has been  a short period  since our last meeting, we have  seen a change  inattitudes regarding  the sustainability  of this favorable economic  situation.  On  the one  hand, thereis the Asian crisis,  which will both limit the  exports of some of New England's  fastest growingcompanies  and increase  domestic competition  because  of lower import prices.  However, we alsoare told that some  New England  companies  outsource production  to Southeast  Asia and may nowbe getting  cheaper components,  thereby keeping costs lower  than would otherwise  be the case.The  other area that has called into question  the sustainability of the regional  expansionis speculative  commercial  real estate  construction.  I have  been reporting for  some time thatwhile the Boston  commercial real estate  market  was very tight, with only small  amounts  ofcontiguous  Class A space available,  there  also were no reports  of plans for major buildingprojects  or much new building under way except for that related to the Artery  Project  goingthrough the center of the city.  That has now changed.  Senior city  officials  told me recently thatplans have  been submitted for 40 new  hotels  in Boston proper.  We also have reports  of  11.3million square  feet of speculative  office  space being proposed  for construction in  the greaterBoston area within the next  12 to  18  months.  At current  absorption rates, this additional  officespace will take about four years  to fill.  Commercial loan data support  stories of an increase  in12/16/97 40construction plans.  First  District loans  are  growing at better than twice  the national  rate, withreal estate  lending  at  our two largest  banks leading  the way at  over three times the national  pace.Commercial real  estate  lending is  seen as a growth  opportunity for the first  time since the late1980s,  raising regulatory  as well as economic  concerns.  We understand  that a  Systemwide  effortis under way to investigate  lower lending  standards  of banks.  We would  suggest that somefollow-up  be done  on commercial  real estate lending  as well,  as we  are doing in the First District.Finally,  one of our  directors, the chairman  of State  Street,  sounded  a warning  of adifferent nature at our  last meeting.  As you know,  State Street has extensive  and highlymission-critical  information technology  systems.  As a result, it has been  a leader in century  datechange  planning.  Recently,  State Street was  asked  to speak to eight  very large European  banksto discuss  Year 2000 problems  and ways  to work together to  solve them.Our  director believes  it would be helpful  and in the national  interest if the FederalReserve  were to raise  this issue  more forcefully.Turning  to the national  scene, we had prepared  our own forecast prior to receiving theGreenbook.  Our assessment for GDP growth  in  1998  was  in the area of 2.8  percent,  followinggrowth of about  4 percent  in  the fourth  quarter of  1997.  We had unemployment  trending  downby year-end  1998  and the core CPI trending up, even after adjustments  were made  formeasurement  changes.  Obviously,  in terms  of broad trends this  is quite different  from theGreenbook  scenario though it is in line with  several private  forecasts.  In preparing this  forecast,12/16/97 41we incorporated  between  .50 and  .75  percentage point of negative  impact on GDP as a result ofthe Asian crisis  and a few tenths  more reflecting our expectations  of a general slowdown  in thedomestic  economy.  The result is that  we had projected  a bit less of a  slowdown  in  GDP growththan the  Greenbook.When I looked at the Greenbook  forecast this  weekend to assess the progressivelygloomier Asian  prospects,  I could accept  the Greenbook  estimates of the effects  of the externalsituation.  However, I am more  agnostic about the impact of smaller additions  to inventories andthe gradual decline in stock market prices,  both of which contribute to a Greenbook GDP outlookthat is well below our forecast in Boston.  Inventory  and stock market levels are  difficult toproject, and I worry that they are expected  to play such an important role in reining in  thedomestic  economy.  I believe  there is a  good probability of growth being stronger,unemployment levels  more stable,  and pressure  on prices  greater than is  evident in theGreenbook, though I do agree  that the Asian  situation  is a wild card.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stem.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The District  economy continues  to grow ata healthy pace  as usual.  I will not dwell on much  of that in  detail; it is not an unfamiliar story.We recently  had a couple of meetings  with business leaders,  and I would say the  generalinformation gleaned  at those meetings  indicated no major surprises.  Business  people areuniformly  positive about the  1998  outlook.  Construction  is a particularly  bright sector.  Theyclearly  expect economic  growth to continue.  All  in all,  I would say the forecast  is generallyfavorable.  It is  also clear now, at least in our region, that wage pressures have  become pervasiveboth geographically  and by job and skill categories.  It is very, very hard to find workers,  and12/16/97 42there are more reports of larger wage  increases.  Some business people believe that they canoffset the higher wages  with productivity  improvements  or other actions.  Some  say that theyexpect profit margins  to be squeezed  in  1998 and presumably  beyond.  That was the generalthrust  of the commentary  at those  meetings.  All in all,  the District economy continues  toperform very nicely.As  far  as the national  economy  is concerned, my view  is that the risks  are on thedownside at this stage.  But in making that statement, I would not start with the currentGreenbook forecast.  If we compare that forecast  with, say, that in the September Greenbook, wedo not have any tightening  of policy  in the current Greenbook  in contrast to the  staff assumptionin  September.  While I certainly recognize  that Asia and its repercussions  represent a significantshock that was  not anticipated  in September,  we also have had  more sustained  aggregate  demandthan was anticipated.  We now have tighter labor  markets.  We have an  economy  that displays  agood deal of momentum.  So, if I were  going to write  down a baseline  forecast based  on all ofthis,  I would put in more real growth  and more inflation than is in the Greenbook.Against that background,  I think the risks  are on the downside.  I say that because ifthe Greenbook is right that there will be no appreciable  acceleration  in inflation, and if I am rightthat wage pressures  are  now pervasive, which is pretty well baked in the cake, then  it seems tome that the implications  or at least the risks for profit margins, stock prices,  and ultimately realactivity are  on the  downside.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy  in the Kansas City Districtcontinues to do well.  Reports from our directors  and other contacts suggest a healthy business12/16/97 43environment throughout the region.  Manufacturing  activity remains  strong, especially in ourdurable goods  sector.  Our manufacturing  employment  has grown  about  1.6 percent over the pastyear, and that is  quite  a bit higher than the national  average.  Our most recent survey  ofmanufacturers  found that production,  shipments,  and new orders  are all increasing  at leastmoderately.  District exports  of manufactured  goods to  Asia represented  less than 3 percent  ofour total shipments  in  1996, so we don't think there will  be a strong  direct effect on Districtmanufacturing from developments  in that  part of the  world.  Retailers  reported higher sales  lastmonth and expect a very robust holiday season  across  the District.  Our regional  farm economycontinues to do  well.As  strong as this District report is, there are some  signs of slowing.  Constructionactivity has been  flat, as are  indicators of future  construction  activity.  Housing permits grew  at arate of only 2 percent  in October,  down  from a  13  percent rate the  month before.  The value oftotal construction  contracts fell 6 percent  in October,  resuming a downward trend  from earlier  inthe year.  District energy  activity has edged down  somewhat  for three  consecutive months.Actually,  the rig count  in our District is now only about  1 percent higher than it was a year ago.Business loan activity  is only modest throughout the  District.Labor markets,  though, remain  tight in most of the  District, and reports  of wagepressures  have become more common in the last couple  of months.  However, there is  still noevidence  that these  pressures  are showing  through  to prices.  The District's unemployment  rateremains  a full percentage  point below  the national  average.  Almost  all the firms we havecontacted  are reporting  labor shortages,  and a  substantial  majority say they are raising wages  andbenefits  in an effort to attract and  retain workers.  The labor shortages are  especially severe for12/16/97 44some  skilled positions.  As one rather frustrated  Kansas  City employer said, he now  feels  verymuch like  the owner of a sports team in his efforts to set salaries for data processing  workers.  Heis being told to negotiate  with the workers'  agents,  and he  is only half joking about that.  But, asI said, the higher wages  are not enabling firms to raise prices.On  the national front,  like others, I expect to see strong economic  growth for thisquarter followed by a slowing  toward trend over the next year.  This slowing  is caused  in part bythe restraint  on some economic  activities  in the United States  stemming  from the Asian financialcrisis.  However,  domestic economic  fundamentals  remain  quite healthy,  and  I think  they willkeep  the economy  growing  at a pace around trend  through next year.  At this point, I expectinflation  to remain  modest over the next year or two despite the tight labor markets,  partlybecause  the appreciation  of the dollar will keep import prices down  for a while.  I think thedownward  revisions in the utilization rate of manufacturing  capacity  also suggest  less pricepressure  than we might have  thought previously.  Inflation  continues to be low and  stable, andinflation  expectations remain  subdued  and are  declining at the moment.  Low  inflation andinflation  expectations in fact may help damp future  wage demands  as we  face these tight laborFinally, although  I recognize  the upside risks and  I believe they  are real  for both thegrowth forecast  and the price  environment,  I do not see any evidence,  at least not anyoverwhelming evidence,  that  action is required at this time.  Thank you.

MS. RIVLIN.  I think it was brave  of the staff to produce  a Greenbook forecast at all.The increased uncertainty  about world events  in the short interval between  meetings  certainly12/16/97 45has widened our confidence  intervals  quite a lot, even  though we don't know exactly  what ourconfidence  intervals  are!My own hunches  are that  the domestic economy  may prove stronger  and moreresilient than the  Greenbook  suggests,  and others  around  the table  have voiced that  feeling.  Isense that  we now have  some momentum in  wage increases,  especially at the low  end of thewage spectrum, and I'm not sure that declining inflation  matters  that much for wage  increases.We may have achieved the Chairman's  definition  of price  stability:  It occurs  when inflation  doesnot play into business  and consumer  calculations.  I also am more  skeptical  than the staff that theminimum  wage has had a lot to do with the wage increases that we have  seen.  I'm more inclinedto  attribute the increases  to tight labor markets.  If that is true, the absence of another  minimumwage increase  going forward will not have as much of a  restraining effect  as  the staff seems toanticipate.  I also  think we could see health cost increases  adding more to labor costs  than theGreenbook  predicts, though we  have not seen that  happen yet.  Especially  with somewhat higherwages,  consumer spending  may prove  stronger  than is projected  in  the Greenbook.  I am a littleskeptical  of a significant negative  wealth  effect if the stock  market does  what we all hope it willdo,  namely, reflect  real  earnings prospects  company by company  and drift down  at a moderaterate.  That kind of outcome  may not have  a major  negative  wealth effect.  There also  may be alittle more momentum in business investment than the staff is estimating.  I would not expect,however, that  a slightly stronger  economy would give us significantly  higher inflation.  Cheaperimports,  including the flood  of goods we  will be  getting  from Asia, are certainly going to holddown  price increases,  and  productivity  growth may hold up a little better than  the Greenbooksuggests.12/16/97I, too, am mystified by the  deflation question that  we get every time we make aspeech.  I have concluded, unlike Ed Boehne, that  the question should not be taken too seriously.That's because  when  I ask those  who pose the question what  they really mean by it, I often donot get  a very good answer.  They may have  in mind something they read on the front  page ofthe Wall Street Journal  that sounds like a good question to  ask a speaker  from the FederalReserve.  The  prospect that prices actually  will go down in the  face of what we normally  see  ascontinuing  strength in the economy strikes  me  as bizarre.On the foreign  front I, too, thought  Bill McDonough's  analysis  was extremely cogent.I spent  a weekin  Europe listening to the remarks  of Japanese  finance ministry  and central  bank officialsconcerning  what they are going to do about their economy.  The explanations  were notreassuring.  One of our European  colleagues  asked  me if I thought  they didn't understand  theproblem  or if they just didn't have the political  will to do what was needed.  I said that I did notknow.  But, there  is still a great deal of uncertainty  about whether they can come  to grips  withtheir problem.  There  are,  of course, possibilities that we  could fall off the precipiceinternationally  or even  conceivably  domestically  if an  international  rout had a sudden  effect  onthe  U.S.  stock market and consumer  confidence, the  kind of Gulf War phenomenon  that nobodyexpected but that did happen.  I think that is unlikely.  On balance,  I am not that far from theGreenbook  forecast,  although  my confidence  interval  on anything that might be said about thenext few  weeks is  very wide.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.12/16/97

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  What a difference  a month makes!  Thestock market  has recovered  from its  500 point decline.  The economy seems to be marchingahead.  We have an incredible  labor market and  generally benign aggregate  inflation, althoughthere is quite  a split between inflation  rates  in the goods  and the services sectors.  Servicesinflation, largely  affected by wages,  more than offsets price  stability or deflation  in thecommodity and  goods sectors.  I think that managing in  this dichotomous  situation is going to bea challenge  for monetary policy.  So far, demand  and growth  are holding up  quite well thisquarter.  We even  hear debates  about how to  spend the federal surplus.Under normal conditions,  we would expect the current momentum  to carry theeconomy forward  at a rather high level  of activity well into  1998.  However,  the depth of theAsian problems is still unknown.  What is certain  is that no one can say that the Asian turmoilhas bottomed out or that the situation  in that part of the world  is under control.  I expect  that theupcoming debates  about funding  the IMF  and the use of the Exchange  Stabilization  Fund willnot shore up confidence  in contemplated  solutions.  In the near term, the  apparent inability orunwillingness to make changes,  particularly  in Korea  and Japan, makes  the prognosis  somewherebetween uncertain and  grim.  The terms "denial,"  "haven't got a clue,"  and "no political  will"seem to crop up continually  in  assessments  of the Asian  economies.  The high Asian savingrates, the culture or Asian way of doing business,  and their economic  growth  history appear to bedulling corrective response  actions.In the  United States, we see  only the beginnings of an awareness  of the potentialproblem and its effects  on U.S.  economic  activity.  Firms are  now starting to assess salesforecasts,  profit outlooks,  and related  investment plans.  In any case,  a widening of the U.S. trade12/16/97 48and current  account  deficits is certain.  More generally, we have been  expecting  slower growth tooccur in the United States.  We may be seeing  some very tentative  signs of developments  thatcould lead  eventually to  a slowdown.  As mentioned, net exports clearly will be diminished  bythe Asian flu and by the  strength  of the  dollar.  Labor  shortages may  directly curtail  expansionplans  in some cases.  In  other  cases, firms that  are unable to raise  prices to pass on higher laborcosts  may find that  expansion or investment plans  simply will not pencil out.  Profits seem to becoming under pressure.  Classic bottlenecks  also are  showing up,  for example, in transportation.In short, the staff forecast of a reduced rate of business fixed  investment makes sense.  Althoughthe fundamentals  remain reasonably  strong in  terms of current  cash flows and sales  as well as thecost of capital, the risk  to investment has risen considerably.  The flattening of the yield curve  isanother indicator that some slowdown  is likely.  Inflationary expectations  appear to have abated.Looking at the  stock market  volatility, I am hoping that it is reflecting  a fundamentalreassessment  of prospects  by investors.Turning  to inflation  and productivity,  despite press debate  on the subject, theproductivity  picture appears  to be getting a bit clearer.  We have seen some  improved statisticsrecently.  There is  some recognition  of improvement by economists.  More  attention is nowbeing directed to trying to understand what is going on in different  sectors of the economy.Capacity  increases  help to explain the performance  of inflation to some  extent.  We may now bewitnessing  some  of the benefits  of a low inflation  or stable price environment:  persistingeconomic  growth, strong balance  sheets, and  sufficient confidence  in forecasts  to carry lowinventories  and make capital investments.12/16/97In  sum, international  uncertainty  has heightened, but the U.S. economy  is doing  quitewell for the  moment.  It is better to  be facing  this higher-risk international  situation  with a U.S.economy  that is not fragile.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  we meet today, both internationaland domestic  developments  give us obvious  food for thought.  I believe,  as  others do, that ourwatchwords  at this point should perhaps be  a "cautious"  and maybe even  a "nervous"wait-and-see  stance.  The trend of the  domestic economy,  as others  have  said, is clearly quitestrong.  The latest figures  indicate  continued  tightness  in some  sectors  of the labor market,particularly  in  the area of information technology.  I also am impressed by indications  ofwho can be  pulled into the labor markets  by the creative  solutions that  others have mentioned.  Iam not an expert on how  an employer  can pull in workers  internationally, but the need to attractsuch workers  may increase.  There is also  some obvious  strength in industrial production.  Therecent numbers indicate quite clearly  a widespread  increase in production  activity.  There  is alarge backlog of unfilled orders  suggesting  some continued  strength  in manufacturing output.I also see evidence  pointing to some moderation.  If we look at the real  adjusted ordersmeasures,  we see an indication of possible  slowing in growth,  admittedly at still very  high levelsof activity.  While we are  observing  tightness in the labor market, I continue to believe  that theevidence indicates an increase  in productivity  above the  anemic  1 percent  trend that we haveseen thus far.  It is quite  clear that  some capital  deepening has occurred.  We  should continue towatch that.  Obviously, there  have been changes  in capacity utilization measurements  that12/16/97 50indicate  some room for continued  output growth without  taxing productive  resources.  Othershave already  talked  about recent  indications of some  slowing in inflationary  pressures  stemmingfrom lower oil prices,  which I think will continue  to be important.With respect to financial  markets, it is  clear that credit  conditions  are not overly  tight.In  addition,  some of the evidence that President Minehan  referred to with respect to investmentsin Boston, discussions with other bankers,  and even  this morning's  American Banker continue toindicate  some loosening of lending standards.  We should be mindful  of that  as we go forward.Finally, with respect to the international  situation I, too, commend the analysis  that weheard earlier with respect  to international  markets.  The  major issue we are  dealing with there isthat  the recovery periods of these countries  and the potential  impact on U.S.  prices  and exportdemand  are still very unclear.  At the time of the previous Greenbook  forecast, I believed that theactual outcome  might end up being closer to the so-called  "worse  case"  scenario  than to theGreenbook forecast.  This time, I am more convinced  of that.  The anecdotal  evidence,  at least,suggests that the Greenbook  forecast as it stands  now is about right.  Secondly, we should alsoconsider our own financial  markets.  A number  of different  forces evidently are  driving them, butit is clear  that we have declining  inflation expectations,  which we should continue  to keep inmind.  The financial  markets  apparently  do not perceive  that  monetary policy is behind thecurve in terms of fostering  our price  stability goal.  I do think the dichotomy between  goodsinflation  and services  inflation will start to come  more into play going forward,  but at this pointneither of them  is pressing  us to do anything  dramatically different.In summary, there  are some clear stresses, particularly in  parts  of the labor market.There are  signs of a pickup  in wage-induced inflation, but there also  is room to believe that12/16/97 51productivity  gains will preclude  significant wage pressures.  I will  admit that there  are few  clearsigns  of moderation in economic  growth  or price pressures.  And, finally, I think the staff has thelikely impact of Asia on our economy about  right in  the Greenbook,  and I commend them forthat.  I conclude that this is a period to wait and see.  In my  view,  any other posture risksupsetting  a fairly complex economic  and financial  system that is looking  for a new equilibrium.Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The forecast  to which  policy must respondis now being shaped by three powerful forces.  The first  is the  strong cyclical  upturn over the lasttwo years.  The second is the diverse  set of factors--some  combination of temporary  influencesand  longer-lasting  structural  changes--that have  restrained inflation  and resulted  in a virtualdisconnect  between the real sector and the wage/price  sector.  The new ingredient,  alsothreatening  to be  a powerful player  in its own right, is the Asian turmoil.  In terms of monetarypolicy, we mainly have  watched  as the first two forces have  battled to a near draw.  We haveremained  alert and asymmetric  to be  sure, but mostly unmoved.  Our inaction  has been rewardedwith exceptional  macroeconomic  performance.  However,  the  further decline in theunemployment rate over the past two months and the evidence of growth  at a pace still wellabove  trend in this quarter have  begun, in my judgment, to tilt the balance  toward  policy actionto lean against the cyclical winds,  notwithstanding  the continued excellent  inflation performance.Simply put,  an economy growing  at a pace near 4 percent  and  operating at a 4.6percent unemployment rate  deserves to have  a little sand thrown into its wheels.  The Asiancrisis  will throw a heap  of sand into the wheels of the economy.  This should, in my judgment12/16/97 52substitute  for at least part of any  monetary policy tightening that otherwise might have beenappropriate.  This  suggests the use of a comparison.  How  much  monetary tightening would berequired to  yield the same  slowing in  growth over the next two  years  as the  staff now expectsfrom the Asian turmoil?  Between the  September  and the December Greenbooks,  the forecast forgrowth over  1998 was revised downward  by almost a full percentage  point  and over  1999 by 1/2percentage  point.  The September forecast  in this comparison  is adjusted  to reflect the samemonetary policy  assumptions  as in December.  The  effect of the Asian turmoil with allowancefor a multiplier  effect accounts  for most of this revision.  We can compare  this effect with that ofa  100  basis point tightening  over  1998  as  shown in the December  Greenbook.  This tightening isestimated to  slow  growth 0.3 percentage  point over  1998 and 0.7 percentage  point over 1999.The dynamics  of the two  shocks  are quite different.  Nevertheless,  this comparison suggests thatthe effects  of the Asian  turmoil might easily  match or exceed  the outer end of any monetarypolicy tightening  we might  have contemplated  over the next year.  That is a lot of sand to throwinto the wheels of the economy.  The dynamics of the response  to the Asian crisis  are  more frontloaded,  and that  may be even better suited to policy objectives  at the moment than a policytightening.The  next questions  are whether the staff may have  overestimated  the spillover fromthe Asian crisis  or underestimated  the momentum  in the economy in the absence  of an Asianshock.  The reality is that there  is a great deal of uncertainty  about the dimension of the Asianturmoil.  First, the situation  has not stabilized in the region.  Second, it is  very difficult to predictthe effect of the  crisis on growth in that region.  And third, the degree  of spillover to otherdeveloping  economies  remains in question.12/16/97The good  news is that  we may not have  to wait  long to grade this forecast.  The staffexpects the  effect of the Asian  turmoil on the  United States to occur very quickly.  It may behinted at in a downward revision  to the forecast  for net  exports and  the less favorable  mixbetween  inventory investment  and final  sales now projected  for the  fourth quarter.  It will beclear for all  to see, according  to the staff, in  the halving  of growth in the  first  quarter relative  tothe fourth  quarter.  Nevertheless,  most of the data we are likely  to see between now and the nextmeeting will  be dominated  by the monthly  data for November and December  and the NIPA datafor the fourth quarter.  These data will more likely, in my judgment,  signal momentum ratherthan  slowdown.  So, we are  likely to have to be  patient and wait for the  data that will come  outafter our next meeting to see more clearly the effects  of the Asian  turmoil.The degree  of the slowdown will,  of course,  dictate the nature  of the challengemonetary policy will face  going forward.  The  staff forecast,  now close to  where private sectorconsensus  forecasts have  been for some time, presents  one  vision, a remarkably gracefulversion of what I would  call a reverse  soft landing.  We begin from an economy  alreadyoperating beyond  its point of sustainable  capacity,  with the prospect of a slow progressive  updriftin inflation.  Growth  slows immediately to below  trend where it remains  over the  next two years,ending  1999 close to NAIRU.  Inflation is restrained  over the interval  by a variety of factors;  itrises  only modestly,  and the cumulative  increase is  limited by the return  toward NAIRU by theend of the period.  This scenario  allows monetary  policy to remain on hold and permits theeconomy to move into the year 2000 near full employment and with inflation  still low.  Maybe!But given the more  balanced risks  going forward,  I certainly cannot rule out that the next movemight be toward ease if the Asian  shock turns out to be even greater than is  now projected.12/16/97Let me  offer an  alternative  that I believe is at least as likely  as the  staff forecast.  Thisis  a forecast that  already has been presented today by Presidents  Moskow, Broaddus,  andMinehan.  The economy  slows  only to  trend.  The unemployment  rate stabilizes near its currentlevel,  having declined  by 1/2  percentage  point recently without any response  from us,  andinflation  begins to edge upward over time.  This would be a  challenge for monetary policy--totighten into an economy  that already  has slowed to trend when the updrift of inflation is  still  onlya forecast.  It is a challenge  I believe we may still  face.  Certainly,  as Presidents  McDonough  andBoehne have noted, flexibility should be our key word, both in respect to the outlook and todemands  on monetary policy going forward.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  At our November meeting,  at least  someof us were thinking hard  about tightening  policy in the face  of very strong economic  growth, butwe were deterred  from doing so by the  problems of Asia.  The Asian turbulence, the  severity  ofwhich was and still is difficult to judge, introduced major uncertainties,  and we  felt it unwise tostir that bubbling pot further with a shift in policy.  Basically,  I believe  that constraint  still holds.The domestic  economy  still looks quite  strong, with what  has come to be a rather  standard arrayof driving factors.  Those  factors  still seem to shift about but not to weaken  on balance.Inflation,  of course, remains  dormant at this time.  However, we do face  some importantchanges.  The  Asian concerns  have intensified  substantially,  and their likely impact  on our GDPappears  to be growing.  I, for one, would bet that the news  is likely to get worse before  the  crisisis over.  For the domestic  economy,  the Greenbook  and  many analysts  see  a slowing in prospectthat goes well beyond the Asia impact.  It is driven  by reductions in rates of growth in12/16/97 55investments  by businesses  and  households  and  a slowing  in inventory accumulation.  To makethis bet,  I would ask for somewhat  better odds, but there is  a good probability of such anoutcome.So, I find myself once again favoring  a "steady  as  she goes policy" but with theseadded  thoughts.  Number one, upside risks seem to me to have moderated  a bit while, numbertwo, significant downside concerns  have  now emerged.  Taken together,  while quite substantialin both directions,  those risks seem roughly  in balance.  This is indeed  a remarkable  time.  Thankyou.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  Last week we held a joint meeting  of our three boards ofdirectors.  I had asked our directors  to come to the meeting to  convey their own views and thoseof other companies  or organizations with  which they confer.  I asked  them in particular tocompare how  1997  was now finishing in relation to their expectations  a year ago and then tocharacterize  their outlook  for  1998.  The word I wrote  down  afterwards  in summarizing  all ofthis was one that  Governors  Phillips and Ferguson  already have used this morning,"dichotomy."  It  was quite obvious that the economic  evaluations  were  similar to the  story of theblind man and the elephant in that the economy looks  and feels  differently to different people.Clearly,  for firms in  some sectors, such as  metals  and energy  and those that compete withimports or are  engaged  in exports,  the year  1997  was  disappointing and  the prospects  for  1998are not as  good as previously  anticipated.  In other areas,  retailers  and  especially importers  saythat business conditions are terrific  and can only get  better.  One  director  reported that a real12/16/97 56estate developer  who operates  in  Ohio  and Kentucky  said that his  industry  was starting toexperience  the super boom of the century.My concerns  are  more along the  lines of what Cathy Minehan  and Gary  Sternindicated earlier  about where  some of the risks  lie.  A realtor said  that activity  cannot increase  in1998 because  his firm barely could handle  all the work that was available in  1997  and it has nocapacity  to handle more transactions.  Construction,  at least in our region,  cannot grow verymuch simply because  there  are no additional  workers to be found.  A union director  said thatemployment  in every segment of construction  could increase  if workers  were available, but hedoes not expect to be able to find them  and he anticipates  that employment  will be close to thecurrent level  a year from now.  He said that even though union contracts  are  going to increaseworker compensation  only about  4 percent in  1998,  nonunion  compensation  is rising much morerapidly.  He indicated  that the unions are trying  to recruit and retain  members by offering themmore  training  and a  focus on lifetime considerations  because  they cannot keep up with thecompetition for workers  on the basis of compensation  alone.  A new problem  for the unions  ishow to  stop subcontractors  on a site from pirating  employees  from other subcontractors.  Theunions could provide  some discipline  if the  subcontractors were  both union employers, butotherwise there really was no discipline  left on projects.  Most directors  said that they and otherpeople they talk to were  concerned about the cost of attracting additional  workers.  One directorcommented  that to keep  employees under current conditions,  an  employer did not give them araise within the current pay grade but jumped them two grade levels.  Another  argued that it wasimpossible  to discipline workers because  of the hot job market.  If an employer tried to tell aworker that there were policies  about showing  up on time or the length  of the lunch hour, the12/16/97 57worker simply  left and went someplace  else.  There  is no accountability.  The paradox  for ourregion  of the  country is that employment growth is so slow.  We probably  will reportemployment  growth of about 0.6 percent  this year in  Ohio.  The increase is so low  becausepeople  are  going elsewhere or there is not enough labor force  growth.On  the national  and international  situation,  I remember  a meeting  with my directorsabout six months ago  and hearing them talk about  how great the U.S.  economy was.  I said, yes,but the paradox  is that the rest of the world is a mess.  We spent  quite a bit of time talking  aboutthe  rest of the  world.  Oddly enough, the foreign economies  have  gotten worse  and are likely toget worse yet.  So, again the word  "dichotomy"  seems  to fit the international  context.  The U.S.economy is doing very  well while much of the rest of the world  is very troubled.  This is not thefirst time that that  has happened;  we  have been in  that situation before.While we all recognize  the problems  that exporting  and some import-competing  firmsare having, people  generally  are optimistic  about the next year or two.  Americans  are  gettingricher.  This is  a period of prosperity.  Last week in preparing  for the  directors'  meeting,  I lookedat the  Blue Chip forecast that had just come out for December.  It had  some special  questionsbecause  of the Far East.  Consistently, every participant  in the forecast revised down theirforecast  of real growth  and inflation because  of what  was happening  in Southeast  Asia.  How is itpossible that  we are worse  off in the sense  of anticipating slower growth  and simultaneouslybetter  off with low inflation,  higher real  incomes,  and wealth rising at a faster rate?  Everybodyagrees that net capital inflows  are  going to be even  larger than they were before.  That word"dichotomy"  has  to be applied to asset prices  as  well as to goods prices.  Some Board  membersreferred  earlier to the  dichotomy between  the prices  of services  and the prices of goods.  That12/16/97 58clearly is  the case, but the notion of dichotomy  also  has to be applied  in the case of asset pricesbecause  we would not say that we have  had deflation  if we think in terms  of what has  happenedin the stock market in the  last three years.When  I get that question  about deflation,  I usually remind the audience  that in theearly  1990s we had a  lot of people,  including some reputable  economists,  writing about assetdeflation because  of what they saw happening  in commercial  real estate.  They were notreferring  to deflation  at all;  they were simply talking  about the  prices  of certain types  ofmanufactured  goods  that were falling,  as was the case in the  1920s.  I was reading some  materialabout the operations of the FOMC  in the early  1930s.  This involved a discussion of the concernabout the international  situation in Britain, Germany,  and Japan.  As  we know, some countriesturned to militarism because  they experienced  a depression while we enjoyed  a boom in the1920s.  I decided  to go back  and look at A Monetary  History of the United States, written byFriedman  and Schwartz.  They say at one point that U.S.  monetary policy was  too restrictive forgoods prices and too expansionary  for asset prices.  That observation  may strike some  assomewhat curious.  I think that it's a useful  reminder  of what can go wrong if we  are too narrowin thinking about words  like  "inflation"  or  "deflation."  When people use  the term "deflation"today to refer to the price  changes of certain types of manufactured  goods  caused by foreigncompetition, innovations,  product enhancements,  productivity  gains, or some  combination  ofthose factors,  that does raise  some questions.  What do they mean by the word "inflation?"Clearly,  it cannot refer simply to the current  prices of goods,  whether domestically produced  orimported.  We have  to think in terms of the present price of future consumption.12/16/97Three  years  ago, Mexican officials  said that their monetary  policies  were notinflationary  as conventionally  measured  in terms  of peso  goods prices  or peso wages  in  1994.That was too narrow  a way to think  about it.  One would not have  found  warning signs  of theproblems  in Southeast Asia by  looking  at prices  of goods  available  in the marketplace  in theseSoutheast  Asian economies  or wages  paid in domestic  currencies.  That is not where  the problemwas manifested any more  than it was  where  one would have  found  the problem in the  1920s  inthe United States,  when the wholesale  price index  fell  and the CPI rose  at a  1 percent  rate, or inJapan  in the  1980s,  when wholesale  prices fell and the CPI did  not increase  at all.  But  that didnot  mean that they did not have  a problem.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Gramlich.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the last meeting,  I felt that from thestandpoint of domestic  considerations  alone,  it was time  to raise  the funds rate.  I was dissuadedfrom actually voting to  do so by the worrisome  situation in Southeast Asia.  While I still favor nochange this month, my reasoning  has changed.  On  the one hand, events  in Southeast  Asia havebecome  much more  worrisome.  Last  month's worse  case scenario  has now become  the bestguess  scenario, and this month's  worse case  scenario  has  gotten quite bad indeed.  The  impact  ofthe  Southeast  Asian crisis  on the U.S.  economy already  generates  all the demand  restraint thatanybody  should  want.  More tightening,  I think, would not be  called for.  Moreover,  there is  stillthe question of what  I will call  international leadership.  The United States  does not want  to betaking monetary  actions  that will  drive up  the dollar and  drive  down Asian  currencies  any morethan  at present or actions  that reduce the growth  in overall  world demand  any more  than atpresent.12/16/97Domestically,  too, conditions  have changed.  While the economy may still be on theinflationary  side of the  NAIRU,  that is not quite as  clear to me.  Recently,  the Board revised itscapacity  utilization figures  showing  much more  productive  capacity than was apparent  earlier.Evidently, the respondents  to the survey do not feel that much  capacity  tightness,  and the overallutilization rate  is now close  to its historical average.  It is not clear whether the state of demand  isbest measured  by labor market  statistics or by the capacity  statistics.  Indeed, the capacitystatistics  seem to be explaining price  and wage  changes better at present.  Moreover, otherleading  indicators  of price increases,  such  as commodity prices, gold prices,  and term-structurespreads,  are remarkably  quiescent.  All that refers to where the economy  is now.  If the staff isright and  we are looking  at a weakening  economy as  we peer ahead,  it may be even less  wise tobe tightening now.  Hence,  I would favor no change  in current  policy.Several  speakers  around the table used the word  "flexibility"  and I think that is a verygood word  for the present time.  It is  frankly quite hard for me  to know  where the predominantrisks are,  whether  they are up or down.  Thank you.

MR. MCTEER.  I will not insist on doing it before the break unless you want to dothat.  I want to follow up on the  Vice Chairman's parable  of the meadow  and the precipice.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Better to do it now.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Okay.  He did not mention the  role of the  IMF, and I thought I wouldask him about that and you, Mr. Chairman,  as well.  I know  that the IMF does  a lot to promotemovement  toward market  mechanisms in command  economies,  and they do a lot to bringgovernment  policymakers  out of an attitude of denial.  But it also  seems that IMF officials12/16/97 61promote  a lot of austerity wherever they  go.  They have  a root canal  theory of the  way to get  outof difficult  situations by canceling  projects and  so forth.  If one  watches  CNN frequently,  onesees  a lot of Asian people  on the street  talking about how they are  going to do their patriotic  dutyand stop  spending money. It seems to me that there is  a psychology  that presupposes  that theway out of this problem situation is to  stop spending.  It is hard to save your way to prosperity inan environment  of collapsing aggregate  demand.  I wonder  what we really  think about the  role ofthe IMF in  all of this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think the IMF has pulled back a good deal from someof its previous  statements.  In addition, there  has been  a lot of talk suggesting  that implicit in theIMF  agreement with Korea  is a 3  percent  growth limit.  Such  a limit does not exist.  There  is aseries of recommendations  with respect to policy, which essentially rest on the issue ofdisbanding the dirigiste-type  of activities, the command  economies  that  the Vice  Chair wastalking  about, and a series of other types  of deregulatory,  market-opening type initiatives  fromwhich the IMF  forecasts  that the growth would be  3 percent.  But there is no directive  on theissue of growth.The interest rate issue  is also noteworthy.  I think there is a recognition  that when  wehave  a degree of instability  in exchange  rates, which suggests  very rapid  changes in  expectations,small increases  in the  annual  rate of interest  are going to be overwhelmed  by changes  inexchange rates.  You will  recall that in  1992 the Swedes tried to curb a run on their exchange rateby raising their overnight interest rate to 500 percent.  They discovered  that when they dividedthat rate by 365, the  daily interest rate was small relative to  the fluctuations they wereexperiencing  in their exchange rates.  I believe  that lesson is  understood by the IMF at this stage.12/16/97 62The issue  really is not  about raising interest  rates  for the purpose  of affecting  the exchange  rate.It  is essentially  a balancing of market  forces and  an effort to keep the money  supply fromgrowing  too fast and  potentially engendering  undermining  inflationary  pressures.So,  I do question  the IMF and their tendency  to use language  relating to this SoutheastAsian  set of actions that  sounds very similar to that used to  describe  actions taken  to counter theinflationary,  government-debt  type  of problems  in Latin  America to which that language  wasapplicable.  Fortunately,  when we look at the details  of what the IMF is doing in Southeast Asia,it turns  out to be significantly  less that  kind of issue.  The IMF  is dealing with a  different  regimefrom  that associated  with the problems  in  Latin America.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Committee's  decisionsat this meeting,  with  respect both to its immediate  posture  in reserve  marketsand to the symmetry  or asymmetry in  its directive,  entail weighing  actualevidence  of strong domestic  economic  activity against  the prospectiveeffects  on the U.S. economy of financial  and economic  developmentsabroad and the possible  interaction  of any Federal  Reserve  action withconditions  in foreign markets.Incoming  data have  indicated on balance that the  U.S. economy  hascontinued  to grow at  an unsustainable pace.  Labor markets  have tightenedfurther and give more  suggestions  of mounting pressure on  wages.  Whilethere are  hints on the  spending side of some slackening  in demand,  this12/16/97could  well be another brief pause  in inherently  noisy statistics; judging fromcontinuing  low levels of initial  claims, employers  have  not yet trimmedtheir hiring  in response  to actual  or prospective  softening  of growth in  sales.Moreover,  with the  important exception  of the dollar, financial  marketconditions remain at least as  accommodative  as those that have beenassociated  with persistent rapid  expansion this year.  In fact, bond yields  arenoticeably lower than they have been  for some  time--including  rates oncorporate  bonds  despite a slight rise in risk premia.  Although  much of theaccounted  for by lower inflation  expectations,  real bond rates  likely are  nohigher than  they were over recent quarters,  and they could be  lower.  Equityprices remain  near the much higher levels reached  over the  spring  andsummer,  holding down  the cost of capital  and boosting  wealth.  And we  seeno signs of additional  caution by banks and other lenders  in advancingcredit.  The ample availability  of credit and liquidity is reflected in robustgrowth of late in broad  measures  of money.  In the staff forecast,  althoughthe economy  slows substantially, the level of output remains  beyond itsestimated long-run  potential,  and the resulting updrift in underlying  inflationbegins  to emerge in the second half of next year.  Taken  by themselves,these circumstances  might  suggest  serious consideration  be  given to firmingpolicy.But developments  overseas provide the  important  counterweight tothose  at home.  The  dollar is higher against a broad  array of currencies,  asTed discussed.  Appreciation  against the Asian  currencies  transmits aportion  of the negative  spending shocks those economies  are  experiencing  tothe United States.  Demands  from Asia for our exports  are further dampedby lower incomes  there and possibly  by financing  problems  that will alsoconstrain  their ability to import until  confidence in their  financial  systemsreturns.  And the  dollar has risen against  the currencies  of industrialeconomies  of Europe, putting even  more downward  pressure on  demandand prices in the United States.  Lower oil prices will  reduce  near-terminflation,  though they will also boost aggregate  demand.  Changes in thelevel  of the dollar and oil prices  can leave  a more lasting imprint on  inflationby reducing inflation expectations  a little.  Altogether, these  influences  willoverride  any increases  in  underlying  inflation pressures  in the next fewquarters  and could  well help to keep  inflation  relatively subdued  over alonger period without  policy tightening, as now embodied  in the staffforecast.By the way the financial  markets have  shaken off incoming  data, itappears  that investors  have placed  much more weight on the potentialeffects  of weakness  abroad than on current pressures  on resources  at home.Not only have long-term rates  fallen half a percentage  point since  the12/16/97turmoil intensified  in October, but commodity  prices have  droppedsubstantially in  reaction  to the stronger  dollar  and prospects  for weakerglobal demand.  However, markets  do not seem to be anticipating  thatproblems  abroad will  on balance  weaken U.S.  economic  performancesubstantially.  The  resilience  of equity markets  indicates that,  aside fromcompanies  with high  Asian exposures,  investors  do not see the foreigndifficulties  as exerting  enough  restraint  on demand  and prices  in  the UnitedStates  to impair earnings  prospects  materially.  Some of the decline  inlong-term interest rates,  probably impossible  to quantify, is  associatedwith a flight to quality.  Even  allowing for such distortions,  however, theflatness of the yield curve  suggests that  market participants  expectshort-term rates  to remain  near current levels  well into  the future,  implyingthat they do not anticipate inflation  pressures--or economic  weakness--thatwould require much  action on your part.Notwithstanding  the assessment of the markets and the staff, theCommittee still may view policy  as somewhat more accommodative  thandesirable at this level of labor utilization.  It could be concerned  that  thestaff and the markets  have overestimated  the impact of foreign difficultieson the  United States.  Or the Committee could  view as  inconsistent with itsown long-run  goals the uptilt of inflation  in the  staff forecast  or level  ofinflation expectations  still embodied in long-term market interest rates.Nonetheless,  there would seem to be reasons  to consider postponing acorresponding  tightening  action.  One reason  would be the  effect  anytightening might have on global  markets.  To be  sure, several  countrieshave tightened  policy since the problems intensified in  October, includingthe United  Kingdom, Canada, and Sweden.  But their combined GDPs donot approach that of the United States  and, more importantly,  theircurrencies  do not play the lynch-pin role of the  dollar, which is,  among otherthings,  the currency  of denomination  for many of the debts of troubledAsian countries.  By  itself, a 25  basis point  increase in  short-term dollarrates  would  not add  appreciably  to the burdens of these  borrowers, whoseprincipal  problems  center around doubts they can roll  over their debts.  Buthigher rates  and the associated strengthening  of the dollar would not maketheir task any easier.  And, unexpected  tightening  in tender markets doesrisk an  outsized response, here and  abroad,  especially  if markets extrapolatefurther policy action.In addition, the cost of waiting for economic  and market conditions tobecome clearer  could  be  viewed as rather small,  even if foreign and  U.S.economies turn out to be stronger than the  staff expects.  With inflationalready low  and declining and  with inflation  expectations, by  somemeasures,  still above  actual inflation,  these expectations  are unlikely to turnaround  very quickly.  Moreover, some  of the influences  that will be12/16/97restraining  prices in  the near term should persist  in any  event.  The  dollar isunlikely  to roll back  soon all of its recent increases,  even  if foreign  marketsbegin to  recover, because  the level  of demand  overseas  will remaindepressed.  And oil prices should  be held down  for some  time by greaterOPEC production  and  smaller world demand, even if not by as  much  as thestaff is  forecasting.  It might be important to firm policy promptly if growthin  the United  States appeared  to  be continuing at a rapid enough  pace totighten labor  markets further, but in the current circumstances  it seemsunlikely  that the Committee would  find itself seriously "behind  the  curve,"in  the sense  of chasing rising inflation expectations,  if it waited  until it hadadditional  information  on foreign markets  and the domestic  outlook.There  is always  a temptation  to await more  evidence on the  state of theeconomy, and the inertia  this can  impart to policymaking  can lead to policyerrors that end  up creating or accentuating  business  cycles.  However,  therange of possible  outcomes for the  economy would appear especially  largeat this  time, given  conflicting  signals from data and projections  and the  fluidstate  of foreign markets  and economies.  Among those  outcomes is thepossibility that problems  abroad could exert sufficient  restraint on the  U.S.economy to warrant monetary policy  easing.  This possibility is what led usto reintroduce  an easing alternative in the  Bluebook after a prolongedabsence.  In that regard,  some outside economists  have marked down theirforecasts  for the United States  by more than Board staff owing to theseevents.  And, even if the staff's baseline is the  best modal forecast,  theCommittee  might perceive some odds--albeit  small--of an even  worsethe U.S.  economy  and financial  markets.  In  something like the  "worse case"scenario  presented by Ted, it would be important  for you to ease  to cushionthe effects  on the United States  and other economies,  as was assumed  in thatexercise.  And the  worse case did not encompass  a freeze  up of markets  andcredit availability  in affected  countries,  which could constrain  their importseven more  for a time.If the Committee,  like  the market  and the staff, now sees a morebalanced  set of risks going forward,  including the possibility of needing  toease, it might  want to reconsider the asymmetry  in its directive.  Retainingthe  current asymmetry  could be justified on the  grounds that in  afundamental  sense the balance  of risks remains  tilted toward  higherinflation.  Persistent strength  in domestic  demand  is likely to keep theeconomy producing  beyond most estimates  of its potential  for some time.At some  point, escalating  labor  costs should begin to pressure prices,  andthe  sooner this situation  is addressed,  the less  disruptive will be thecorrection.  Moreover,  of course, the  Committee  could ease its policy stancefrom  an asymmetric  directive  toward tightening  if circumstances  changed12/16/97 66enough.  But the Committee  may view  the odds on tightening  over theintermediate  term as  having receded considerably,  especially  with priceincreases  likely to be  damped for a  while.  And it might want to put someweight on the original purpose  of the  sentences  in question--that  is, possiblepolicy actions  over the  intermeeting  period--if it considers  there to be somepotential that a worsening situation  would call  for a prompt  response.  If theCommittee shares  these  perspectives, symmetry  might better represent  thecontingencies  it sees confronting  policy.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions  for Don?  If not, let me  warn ofour talking about the  "worst" case  or "worst" around-the-world  scenario because  everyone herecan contemplate  a case,  which is far more negative  than the so-called  "worst"  case.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Ted Truman, to his credit, did not say "worst"  case.  He referred to a"worse"  case.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  This time we  did it right; we  did not call  it  "worst!"  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Oh, "worse"  case.  Sorry about that.  There  is a "worst"case,  but I don't even want to contemplate  it.There  is not terribly much I can add with the exception  of one  area that I think has notbeen fully addressed  in  our deliberations  today.  We  are  looking at a November  CPI increase  of0.1  percent.  In  prior months,  the changes  in  the CPI and the PPI clearly exhibited  a recedingtrend in the rate of inflation,  no matter how these measures are  affected  by technical  adjustments.In  fact, we have been observing that trend for quite  a long period of time in  the context of stillrising profit margins, as best we can judge the latter from the most recent data.A distinctive  feature of the Greenbook  forecasts in the last two  or three  years,  which ithas shared  with other forecasts,  has been the projection  that profit margins would begin to fallimmediately from the  base period of the forecasts.  This is important  because  arithmetically,  aswe all know, if prices  are not  changing and profit margins  are  rising, unit costs  are going12/16/97 67nowhere.  As we saw  in the third-quarter profit  data for nonfinancial corporations,  that wasindeed the  case.  We do not have  such data  for the  fourth quarter as  yet, but  the presumption  thatunit cost increases  are  low and productivity is  accelerating  seems  rather difficult  to supportconsidering the  size of the increase  in the hours  input, adjusted  or otherwise  for hours ofself-employed  workers, in  the available data for the fourth quarter.  It will  be difficult  to get  asignificant increase  in productivity  in  the fourth quarter with the data we  already  have  seen forsoftening  is implicit in the  Greenbook  because there appears  to be  a very substantial  aberration  inthe 400,000 plus  increase  in the payroll  employment number for November.  In particular, theseasonal adjustments  are dubious,  not to mention  the hours figures, as  was  explained in Part  II ofthe Greenbook.Leaving  aside the measurement problems,  there is no  way of getting  around the  factthat, on average,  productivity  has been accelerating  over the past several  quarters.  We can argueat great length about how businesses  are managing  their operations.  Obviously,  if thetechnological  capabilities  are not there, the potential real  rates  of return  on facilities  are notachievable.  I don't care  how assiduously businesses  try  to contain costs.  If they don't  have thenecessary  underlying  infrastructure,  they will not be  able  to do so.  But they have  succeeded  indoing so, and the reason,  as we have  discussed on numerous  occasions  in the past, is that theopportunities  to improve  profits clearly  have been  expanding.  I don't know  what the  real gainsin underlying productivity  will turn  out to be in  the fourth  quarter.  I don't know  what they willbe in the first, second, third,  and fourth quarters  of next year.  I do know that the currentGreenbook  does the same thing it did last time,  namely, it takes the  growth of so-called total12/16/97 68factor productivity--the  residual  in the  decomposition  of labor productivity  growth--and  turns itsignificantly  negative.  The staff forecast  of a pickup in capital  deepening  implies a  fullpercentage  point  slowing  in output  per hour between  1997  and  1998  from what it would be iftotal factor productivity  growth were held at its  1997  pace and another quarter percentage  pointslowing for  1999.  I don't think any of us knows  what that number can or should be.  All I cantell you is that  we keep getting reams  of ever lower CPI readings  that seem  outrageous in thecontext of clearly accelerating  wages  and  an ever-tighter labor  market in which employers  arerunning out of people they can hire.  Yet, prices are just locked  in.  Indeed, as Don Kohn  pointedout, if we  look at the  underlying price structure,  we see falling  prices.  The Journal  of Commerceindustrial price  index,  which every deflationist and  every bear uses to make  this case,  doesindeed show  prices  going down  significantly.  That is noteworthy because  this is not aparticularly biased  commodity price index.  It may well be the best among comparable  indexes.Something very different is happening.  I think the  only way  we can explain it is fromthe  output per hour  side.  Unfortunately,  that is where  our data are  weakest.  The behavior ofinflation  suggests to me that potential  output is  a lot higher than we tend to assume.  Leavingaside the mismeasurement  of prices, the  notion that we  are on the brink of a major accelerationof inflationary pressures  is correct arithmetically  if we assume a stable rate  of growth  inproductivity.  It  is not correct  if we leave open the potential  for an acceleration  in productivity.The  price data are telling us that the hypothesis  that productivity  is accelerating  cannot bedismissed unless the profit figures we are  looking at are  all wrong.  I am merely indicating  thatthere  is something  quite unusual  going on here, and we  have been  aware  of this for  aconsiderable  period  of time.  As  I have  argued  many times in the past and despite the latest set of12/16/97 69employment  data, employment  cannot increase  indefinitely  at the rate  it has been  increasing.Leaving  the Phillips curve  aside, leaving  NAIRUs  aside,  leaving everything  aside,  I do not knowhow one can  put negative  people in an  equation and then run it out.  At some  point, somethinghas to  give.  We  cannot increase  productivity  merely by  an act of will.  There are  upside  limits,so  that if effective  demand continues  to grow as  it has,  there is no question  that inflationarypressures  have to  emerge.  To paraphrase  St.  Augustine,  yes,  but not  yet.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  He  said,  "God,  make me pure, but not yet."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I didn't want to  say the first part of that!  [Laughter]There is  something going on here  that we  have not  observed in decades,  and  maybe decades  istoo  short an  interval.  I was  startled  by this morning's  CPI report.  We cannot  keep getting  suchnumbers  and continue  to  say that inflation  is about to  rise.  As  we keep projecting  a higher rate ofinflation,  it keeps going down,  and  there has to be  an admission at  some point that somethingdifferent  is affecting  prices.  The  growing  recognition  of that is the  reason why  markets arereacting as they are  to incoming  economic  information.  That is why the big November  surge of400,000 in payroll  employment  had only  a very slight  market impact.  I don't think the  surgeaffected  policy expectations  and economic  forecasts.  The markets  are responding  to  somethingthat  they perceive  as  important.  We  don't know  fully what it is;  we do not have  any data;  andwe probably will  not for a while.As  I said last  time,  I do not  deny that the  Asian problem is a crucial  issue  with respectto policy.  But  I think it is a mistake to say that we  should be  moving  at this  stage, absent  theAsian  difficulties.  That is at least a debatable  issue.  I probably would come  out in favor  ofmoving if  for no other reason than  that this economy  has been  undergoing  a powerful  surge and12/16/97 70we could not do much  to harm  it by moving rates  up 25 basis points.  It is very hard to make thecase that  we have tight money when the housing  market  is behaving  as well as  it is,  including thestarts figures,  granted the  seasonal  factors, that came out this morning.  So, we  have experiencedunusual developments,  which get compounded  by the Asian situation.  The Asian problem is afascinating  one for macroeconomic  evaluation  because,  as those of you who have been involvedin building models know,  there  is virtually no way that we can infer  a very large  impact on theAmerican  economy  from the  Asian developments  in light of our fairly limited trade connections.We cannot  get a very  large number using the existing model  structure because the latter in effecthas coefficients that essentially reflect the level of confidence  that has existed over the period forwhich we are  fitting the model.  We have to bring in a  confidence-deterioration  factor as anexogenous  variable to get  a different  result.  It is very difficult to infer it in any material  sense.In theory, we  can get virtually  any impact we want if we remember  that what we meanby psychology  is the degree  to which  people withdraw or reach out.  In effect,  it is a timepreference type of issue.  When people  get  frightened,  they disengage or pull back fromwhatever they  are doing.  If they are  involved  in markets and  are net  long, then disengagingmeans that prices  go down.  If they  are net  short, prices  go up.  In most markets, participants  arenet  long.  There  are very  few  historical periods like  the Northern Pacific  panic  early in thiscentury  when everyone decided  that there  were more  shorts than there were  stocks  outstanding.That led to a  panic and everybody ran for cover;  they  disengaged.  If people disengage  enough,the  payments system  begins to freeze  up, intermediation  is curtailed,  and all forms  of lendingcontract.  There  is no  downside in any model that is  structured  to pick this up, but a huge12/16/97 71implosion can nonetheless  occur.  I don't  think any  econometric model  would have picked up the1929-1932  debacle without  a major exogenous  evaluation of how human beings  behave.There  is something going  on out there,  and  I ask myself where its  impact is being felt.Can it be  on consumer confidence  in  the United States?  I would  say, hardly.  There is noevidence  of it; that would require  a far greater  disturbance.  We are just beginning to see reportson the Asian  crisis on the front pages  of our newspapers.  It is  still not in our mindset;  it is notsignificantly  affecting  attitudes.  Is bank lending pulling back  here?  I do not see any  evidence ofthat  whatever.  A significant  pullback cannot be based  on the notion that there are  a lot of losseson loans to Southeast  Asia, because  our financial institutions  have not lent that much toborrowers  in that part of the world.  Even  if they lost 90 percent of those loans,  it would not be abig deal.The only place  a material  effect  can occur is in the combination  of asset prices  andcapital  investments.  For example,  one can  envisage  a significant  change in  the equity premiumin the  American  stock  market.  The calculations that people are currently making have the equitypremium  at the low end of normal ranges with very significant further increases  in earningsembodied  in the  relationship.  At any  realistic earnings  forecast,  stock prices  will be substantiallyovervalued.  It is conceivable that we could  get a  significant implosion here.  I believe the oddsare small but not zero.  What that  essentially does is to create  a high level of uncertainty,  as theVice  Chair was mentioning.  It gives us the much wider ranges  of uncertainty  that GovernorRivlin referred  to.  A lot of us were gradually  becoming concerned  about the range ofpossibilities,  not the probabilities but the tails of the  various types of distributions, which  veryclearly seem to be  getting more extended.12/16/97It  is useful  to think in  terms of the Vice Chair's  analogy  about the  meadow  on the rightand the ditch on the left.  Some of the  market changes  in Asia have been overdone.  If financialconditions there  stabilize, the economies  in that region could  very easily  recover, putting us backin much the  same  place that  we were in the sense  that our economy  would still be experiencingquite strong demand.  There  would be some  lessening of export demand  because it is veryunlikely, given the trauma they have experienced,  that the Asian economies  will suddenly returnto 8,  9,  or  10 percent  rates of economic  growth.  If they achieve  2, 3,  or 4 percent  rates for awhile, that is not going to be a bad outcome.  They  have been subjected  to  a tremendous  shock,and economies  do not recover from that sort of shock readily.  It is  going to take  a while for themto recover.  But that is not the critical  issue.  The issue is whether  their economic performancewill be severely  negative  or whether these  countries just will  not be the Asian  tigers that theyonce were.As  I indicated before,  the IMF is facing  a different type of model  in its efforts  toaddress  the Asian  situation.  It is not clear  that the problems  are going to be resolved readily.  Ido not  think the issue here  is  one of propping up  a number of institutions.  I believe there is afundamental  flaw in the Asian economic  model that is only becoming apparent  now as theirtechnologies  move closer to the cutting edge of technologies  in the world and they begin to runinto problems because  government-directed  investment cannot work in highly  sophisticatedeconomies.  I do not think they believe  that.  They  have had  an extraordinary  run for threeyou can do  a lot of things to get them to say things that  sound more12/16/97 73forthcoming;  but you do not change  a people's view of how the world  works  in  a matter of twoor three weeks.If there is a big flood of IMF money into Asia,  I think we will  find that they are goingto continue  doing whatever they did before.  They are going to behave  the way they think theyought to, which is what  got them into trouble.  Injecting a lot of IMF  money would just prolongthe problem  situation, but I don't believe that is going to happen.  I think that there has  been aconsiderable  increase  of realism in the IMF.  I do not anticipate  a crisis, but I do not expect aquick recovery.  The problem is going to be with us for a  good while,  and I think it is going tohave generally negative  effects,  the extent of which I do not have  any way to evaluate.I have gone on longer than I expected.  Where I come out on policy is that I  continueto believe that we will  have to move rates  up  at some point.  I see that as the most probable  nextmove.  This assumes  that the  Asian problem will diminish and that the tremendous  underlyingthrust that we have  in our economy eventually will run into limits stemming from productivityconstraints.  But if we focus  on the very  short run, it strikes me that  the probability of our havingto move in the  next month or two is exceptionally  low, given  the price  numbers  we have beenlooking  at.  The only move that we might make in this period, if we  move at all,  might be tolower rates  as  a consequence  of some substantial  asset  deflation, a prospect  that has a lowprobability.Accordingly,  I would be marginally in favor of alternative  B  symmetric this time. Onthe basis of the  price indexes  for the last couple of months, that probably is the right policy untilwe  see some evidence,  not necessarily  of consumer prices,  but at least of commodity  prices orthe prices  of intermediate goods  starting to move or some evidence  of declines  in profit margins.12/16/97 74All of these  developments  will precede  an acceleration  of the  CPI, but we are  seeing none ofthat, and  it is going to take several months  for anything  like that to emerge.  I think the  market, inlooking at central bank policy, probably is saying  that the Fed will not move until we see somepressure  on prices.  It is  not sufficient  evidence  to argue that the economy is running  hot, that thelabor markets  are  very tight, and that  there is  evidence  that wages  are accelerating.  That isnecessary  evidence, but it certainly  is not sufficient for a policy move unless one  argues  thatproductivity  is not accelerating,  that profit margins  are  not expanding,  and  that the  total unitcosts structure  is  beginning  to exert  greater pressure  on prices  that we are  able to observe.  As faras I can see, none  of that  is occurring.  So,  I would argue for "B"  symmetric.  Other membersChair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I think  that "B"  is the right calland  that it is a clearer choice than the intermeeting  adjustment decision.  I agree with you that,absent the international  events,  this might be  a rather good opportunity  for  a 25 basis pointmove that could do very  little harm in present circumstances  and probably  some  good towardachieving  our  goal of price stability.  But given  the international  considerations,  I believe such amove would be very ill-advised at this time.  The financial markets  are thin, both because theas we  get closer to the end of the year.  So, this is not a good time for a policy move, whichclearly would be a great  surprise in the financial  markets.I believe I have become something of a resident theologian on the  meaning ofsymmetry  and asymmetry.  We have been using asymmetry  since the May meeting essentially  to12/16/97 75indicate  that  the central  bank of the United  States remembers  that its primary  responsibility  is tofoster sustained  economic  growth  through price  stability and that the  balance of risks has  been inthe direction  of rising inflation  even  though  there has been  no evidence  in the  inflation numbersto that effect.  However, I think the  international  situation currently demands  that we be  flexibleenough to respond as  appropriate  to  unanticipated  developments,  so that  signaling  our generalanti-inflation  intent with a bias in the  intermeeting  adjustment instruction  is not desirable  at thispoint.  We may wish to return to asymmetry  at some  later date.  I certainly do not think we  havereached  a point where  we would want  an asymmetric  directive  toward easing.  That would haveto be based  on the assumption of an international  crisis that we are  not in fact  assuming.  On  theother hand,  I also think a tightening move  would not be appropriate  at this time. In my view,there is almost a zero possibility that we would  tighten between now  and the next meeting.Therefore,  the best choice is to move to symmetry,  largely to avoid  an emotional  or intellectualbias that might make us feel that we could not  respond appropriately  to any critical  development.With that  interpretation of what symmetry  means, I believe that "B"  symmetric  is the rightjudgment.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  In thinking about the current  situation, I ask myself, where  are  therisks to the forecast?  Last month, I was more  negative  than the staff on  the Asian situation,  butmy sense now  is that the  Greenbook has it about right, although  there certainly is a  lot ofuncertainty  about potential developments  in Asia.  It is possible,  of course, that a "worse  case"situation could materialize.  The  Asian situation could  get worse, spread to Latin America,  affectHong Kong and in  turn China more significantly,  and the contagion  could develop  into a12/16/97 76worldwide  downturn.  On  the other hand, it is  also possible that,  given the strength  of the currentdata, domestic  growth could fail to slow  sufficiently  despite retarding external  effects, feedinginto a cycle of more intense wage  and price pressures  and ultimately into higher  inflation.  Tome, these risks  seem fairly balanced  right now, but I think the costs  of being wrong are notbalanced.If, in fact, international  developments  occur along  the lines  of the Greenbook  forecastor even get worse, we will  not be  in such a bad situation if we do nothing now.  Monetary  policyis not overly tight.  We have  inflows of capital  to the United States that are reducing  interestrates.  We have  low inflationary  expectations.  There is not a lot to be lost in waiting  in that case.On  the other hand, if resource use  is tighter than we think and economic  growth is  stronger thanprojected in  the Greenbook, we could be waiting too long.  Wage  inflation could get embedded.It would  then cost more to root it out,  and it could cost more  at a time  when the  strength  of theU.S. economy  is more rather than less important  to the worldwide  situation.  In thinking aboutthese alternative costs, I conclude  that the right  decision is probably not to do anything now.  Theunderlying  situation is  too uncertain  in Asia.  I also  believe that  it would be desirable  to see theprice data stabilize, if not tick up, before  we move on the inflationary front.  But because  I thinkthe costs of being  wrong in the direction  of greater  inflation  are more  significant than if we  arewrong in the other  direction, I would have  a  slight preference  for staying  with the  asymmetricdirective.  I would interpret  symmetry and asymmetry  a little more broadly  than simply lookingat what is likely to  happen over the next several  weeks.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  in  view  of the situation  in Asia,  I certainly  wouldrecommend  against a change in rates  at the present  time.  So, I would support alternative  B.  Ihave a  slight preference  at this point for asymmetry  because  I do  not think the distribution  oflikely outcomes  with regard  to inflation  is unbiased.  In my view, it is biased toward higherinflation, but in the short run--at least in  the very short run--it may be less biased  than it was  inthe  past.  Therefore,  I would not object to symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  My policy preference  today, Mr. Chairman,  takes account of thenew Greenbook projection,  which  assumes no action  on our part and  has the growth ofemployment  barely getting down  to a  sustainable trend over the projection  horizon.  Given thatforecast  and for the reasons I outlined earlier today,  I still think there  is a significant upside  riskin  the projection, even  taking account of Asia.  I mentioned  a number of things  earlier, and oneof them was my concern  about the  impact of rising real wages on consumption.  Some of thecomments  around the table have  reinforced that point for me.I recognize,  of course, that there  are arguments for not moving at this point.  There areclear reasons for lying low.  Don Kohn laid them out well, and you summarized  them  also, Mr.Chairman.  But I continue to believe that there  are considerable  risks to delaying  action further.Cathy Minehan  mentioned  some of those.  Weighing the reasonably  hard information we haveabout current U.S.  economic  conditions against  the softer projections,  I still think, stubbornly nodoubt, that a modest  1/4 point increase  in the  funds rate  today would be a prudent step  for us totake.  It is  a form of cheap  insurance.  In my view,  not only would a small rate increase todaybetter position policy for unanticipated  strength in the economy if domestic demand  should fail12/16/97 78to slow, but it would signal  that we  are prepared to take  whatever  actions we need  going forwardto contain inflation.  That in itself would help longer-term  interest rates resume their role asautomatic stabilizers.Let me make one  final comment  about flexibility.  A lot of people  have used the  wordflexibility today.  I know I  am shifting the context a little here,  but flexibility  certainly  does notapply to our management  of the funds rate.  Over  much of the  last year, that rate has been parkedat 5-1/2 percent.  That  is not the way  one would expect short-term  interest rates to behave  in anadjusting,  fluid economy.  I worry  that we may be introducing  inflexibility by the way  we  aredealing with this policy instrument.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would support your recommendation  onthe  "B"  alternative, and I certainly would not disagree with  you  on symmetry.  I will tell you thatI, like  others,  remain concerned  about the tight labor markets  and the possible effects they mayhave on inflation, but I do not conclude  that  monetary policy has necessarily  been overlyaccommodative.  I say that partly because,  as has been noted,  the real  fed funds rate  has beenabove its long-run  average.  I know that average should not be  equated to the real long-termequilibrium rate, but  still it has been relatively  high.  I would also mention that while M2 growthhas been above the upper bound of the Committee's  range, it has not been  substantially abovethat range  and it is projected  to moderate.  As  I mentioned earlier, the utilization  ofmanufacturing  capacity  is near its long-term average  after the latest revisions.  Perhaps  mostimportantly,  as you also noted, inflation has been quite stable.  Core inflation has been stable  or12/16/97 79long-term inflation expectations  are  stable or declining.  Long-term rates  have fallen in thisenvironment.  So, I do not think that right now we are in  a position  to change monetary  policy.Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I support your recommendation  of "B"  symmetric.  There  is nopressure  to act now.  It seems to me that there is time  to see how things play out.  Given  theshape  of the yield  curve, the recent inflation  experience,  and the inflation  outlook, I have toquestion  the direction  and timing of the next move.  This seems to me  to be  an argument  forremoving  the asymmetry  from the directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I support your recommendation  for "B."  I think the  case for stayingwhere we are is  overwhelming today.  The issue  of symmetry  is a more marginal  decision,  and Idon't have strong feelings  about it one way or the other.  In my view,  the major case forremoving the asymmetry  is that  symmetry is probably  a more  accurate  description of wherepolicy is.  Now and then, I think we ought to be accurate.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, the economy is quite strong currently, but I believethe situation  in Asia is likely to be  a key restraining factor going forward.  I agree  that no oneknows  for sure exactly  how severe the  Asian problems will be  and how they will  play out.  In hiscomments,  Ted Truman  did not rule out the possibility of a better case.  It  was not the bestpossible  case, but it was  a better case.  So, there is  another side to this in that adverse12/16/97 80developments  in Asia may not be as  severe as we now tend to anticipate.  I agree that  we shouldbe  cautious until more  of the  uncertainty  is resolved.  While I do not favor changing  policy atthis time, I do think that the  risks are tilted to the upside.  So, I would personally favor  retainingthe  asymmetric directive,  Mr. Chairman,  although  I could live with your recommendation  forgoing  back to a balanced  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman,  I support the  recommendation  for no change thismorning.  After trying to sort out the  crosscurrents we  have  discussed in the  last three and a  halfhours, I still have the  sense that the Asian shock represents  something of a  substitute  for amodest policy move.  I, too,  could support a symmetric  directive, but on balance  I would be alittle more  comfortable with  an asymmetric  directive  for a while longer to make sure that thestrength in  the domestic  economy is not overwhelming  the drag we are  getting frominternational  developments.  But, again, I can support  a "B"  symmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support your recommendation  both interms  of alternative B  and  a symmetric  directive. I do  so principally  because  I believe there  ismore  than enough uncertainty to go around.  We  do not know how severe the Asian problem  isgoing to be.  We  do not know how far it is going to spread.  We really do  not know what itmeans for the United States  in terms of quantifying  it.  In light of all that, it seems  to  me that nochange in policy  and a fair amount of flexibility are appropriate  at this point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.12/16/97 81

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I, too,  support the "B"  symmetric.  I don't think there is  any case  formoving rates  down.  Were it not for the Asian problem,  one could make  a case for moving ratesup, but I'm not sure I would be  totally persuaded by  that case,  given the CPI and  theproductivity  information.  But we do have the Asian  problem and  we do not know  how severe itseffects will be.  So, it  seems to me that  "B"  symmetric is the right thing to do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  I, too, concur with your  "B"  symmetric  proposal.  I agreeparticularly  with what President  Stern has  said.  We are in  an era of significant uncertainty,  and Ithink it is important  to signal  to the markets  that as a responsible  central bank we  are prepared  tobe  flexible in our effort to address whatever  challenges may emerge.  I  also recognize  that this isan intermeeting  approach,  and we will have a chance to rethink this in the near future.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  After  our action to increase  the funds rate  last March, we had  a debateat the May  meeting concerning  the desirability  of a further increase--whether  we should drop theother shoe.  In an environment  of decelerating  real growth as evidenced by  an assortment  ofmeasures,  related expectations  of a fairly  soft second  quarter, and slowing money growth, weexpectation that  growth in employment, real  output, and other measures  was going to  be a lotslower  in the second half of the year in the context of fairly benign money growth.  That did nothappen in the third quarter, but at the September meeting  we were still  looking for muchslower money and economic  growth in the fourth quarter.  So, we  decided not to tighten policythen either.  My guess is that if we had been focusing on nominal  spending  growth last May  or12/16/97 82any  of the other measures of demand  people  want to focus on, such  as real  output growth,employment  growth,  the unemployment  rate,  or various  measures indicating  capacity  pressuresin the economy,  we probably would have raised rates at that time  and we probably would be gladtoday that  we did.  We would  not have financed  so much  demand  over  the past six months thatinduced  a lot more imports  and enabled  the Asians to get  themselves into  a deeper hole.However,  of the  various  reasons for not acting  now, I think the Far East  crisis is among the betterreasons.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  as I said earlier,  I think this is a remarkable  time in thesense that we face  very substantial  risks, both up and  down.  This  leads  me to support  stronglyyour proposal  for a "B"  symmetric  directive.  But there is another interesting reason forsymmetry this time.  It relates to some  asymmetries  that I see  in terms of the time  frames  withinwhich these different  sets of risks might present  themselves.  The  downside  risks primarilyrevolve  around the Asian  situation,  and if that situation  blows up and forces  some  kind of policyeasing move,  that is  liable to happen  reasonably  soon and probably  fairly  dramatically.  On theother hand,  the upside risks  that have  been with us  for a long time  are liable to emerge  over thelonger term  and more slowly.  As a consequence,  we would have a better opportunity  to respondif that is the  way to go.  So, the short-term risks  seem to me to  be more on the downside,  and  wepresently  have  an  asymmetric directive  toward tightening.  I would prefer not to face theprospect,  should it emerge,  of going all  the way from an asymmetric  directive  toward tighteningto an  easing move  in an  intermeeting period.  If we  were to adopt a symmetric  directive now, I12/16/97 83believe we would then be very  well positioned  to respond  to whatever  might emerge  as  time  goeson, whenever it might emerge.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given the  expected effects  and  uncertaintyrelated to the  Asian turmoil, I agree  that we  should hold policy  unchanged today.  Because  therisks are  better balanced,  I also  support a move to a symmetric  directive.  It is,  as PresidentBoehne  suggested,  likely to  be a much better description of our intermeeting posture.  I believe  asymmetric  directive  has the  advantage of signaling our flexibility to respond  quickly to a worsecase scenario,  should it materialize,  without changing our view that the  next move is  still likelyto be in  a policy tightening  direction.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I supported a symmetric directive  before Governor  Kelley talkedabout the  relative timing of the various risks,  and I support such a directive  even more afterhearing  his comments.  It  is doubtful that we  will have to ease in  the near future, but it certainlywould be embarrassing to ease  with an  asymmetric  directive toward tightening.  So, I supportyour recommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Gramlich.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I am for "B"  with symmetry.  I say that both from an  internationalstandpoint and a domestic  standpoint.  The one thing that gives me pause is  that if we wait to seeevidence of inflation, given  that there are lags in monetary  policy, it could be too late.  I thinkthat is a cost that we need to keep  in  mind, but I still conclude,  given the  current data on the12/16/97 84economy and the international  situation,  that "B"  with symmetry is the most logical course ofaction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  First Vice  President Rives,  do you  want to add anythingto this discussion?

[SECTION]

MR. RIVES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Real GDP growth through the  first threequarters  is above  most estimates of potential  growth.  Fourth-quarter estimates  and forecasts  aresharply higher than they were  earlier in  the year.  Personal  spending and credit  growth  areexpected to end the year on  a high note.  The broad monetary  aggregates, M2  and M3,  aregrowing  at or above the  announced  target ranges.  On balance,  it appears  that the surprisinglylow rate of inflation in  1997  may give way to higher  inflation in  1998  and beyond.Nevertheless,  continued  turmoil in the  Asian markets  argues  for a steady policy  prescription atthis meeting.  In my view, the  FOMC continues  to face  the challenge of when and  how to lock inrecent gains on inflation.  We would support  "B"  asymmetric.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There  seems  to be  a very  substantial  majority for "B"and a modest majority for symmetry.  Would you  read the directive  in that context?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The directive  is  on page  14  of the Bluebook:  "In theimplementation  of policy for the immediate future,  the Committee seeks conditions  in reserveIn the context  of the Committee's  long-run  objectives for price stability  and sustainableeconomic  growth, and giving careful consideration  to economic,  financial, and  monetarydevelopments,  a slightly higher federal funds rate  or a slightly lower federal  funds rate  might be12/16/97 85acceptable  in the  intermeeting  period.  The contemplated  reserve  conditions are  expected  to beconsistent with some  moderation  in the growth of M2  and M3  over coming  months."
