[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Finally, while  Bill  Conrad  has been herebefore,  this  is  the  first  time  he  is  representing the Chicago  Bank.So  I have many announcements--more  than  usual  for  this  organization.Let's  start by having somebody move  to  approve  the minutes  of  the  July5-6  meeting.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Peter  Fisher, wouldyou take  us  through the  foreign  operations Desk report?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  [Statement--See  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On  that thereare  two  ongoing  thoughts  that  are  supposed  to  be  insights  into whathappened.  First is  the notion  that  the moves  on  the part  of  those  twocentral  banks were suggestive of  the  fact  that  declines  in Europeanrates  had come  to  an end.  The  other  is  that  because  the publicdebt/GDP ratio  in both  countries  is  exceptionally high, the  rise  ininterest rates  was  suggestive of  the  fact  that  the deficit  might bemore of  a problem.  To  which of  those  two,  if  any, do you  subscribe  toexplain this  phenomenon, which scares  every central banker  I know?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think  the market's  immediate reaction  was morethe  first  of  the two you mentioned.  I think that  the extremity of  thereaction, if  I can  distinguish the  fact  of  the  reaction from  theextent of  the move once  it  got  going, was more  of  a gnawing anxietyabout  the  general  fiscal  condition of  Europe--of all  the  Europeancountries put  together.  But untangling  those  two  anxieties  in  arelatively short  time  is  quite a problem.  I would point out,  ifyou'll  forgive me, Mr.  Chairman,  that  the very technical  aspects  ofthe  announcements were not  handled as  elegantly as  they might  havebeen.  The  Italian announcement  came with  60  seconds  left  in  tradingon LIFFE  futures.  There were many people  in  London with very bloodyfingers  trying to  cut back their positions.  That  certainly8/16/94contributed to  the  very extreme  reaction on  that day.  Clearly, thosetwo  countries  are  the  outliers  on  the  fiscal  side  in  Europe.  No  onein  Europe had been anxious  about a general  backup  in  short-term ratesbeyond the  fact  that  everyone  expected the  UK  to  begin raising ratessometime soon.  As  the market  digests what happened and distinguishesthe  stronger countries  from  the weaker  countries,  there may be someimprovement, but  I wouldn't  expect  that very soon.  The markets mayhave  a hard time  digesting and untangling whatever  it  is  theBundesbank does  on  Thursday.  I think  that  there  is  likely to  be aperiod of  continued gnawing in  European bond markets  for  several daysto  come.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I have  one,  Peter;  it's  sort  of  in two  parts,but  they are part of  the  same  question.  Markets  tend to  latch on  tothings  in  faddish ways.  Something was  almost  implicit  in what yousaid, and  I want  to  see  if you want to make  it  explicit--it's aboutthe  fad that  dollar/yen dances  to  the  U.S./Japan  trade talks  orevents,  that  is,  to  monthly announcements  of  the  trade  figures or  tothe  talks.  It  was  almost  implicit  in what you said that  the marketseems  to  be getting  off  that  fad.  Did you mean to  say that?  And thenthe  second part  is  related to  the  looming date,  September 30th.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think  the market  is  faddish;  I'll  agree withyou on  that.  I think  there  is  an  opportunity  for  the market  to beless  anxious about  the  trade  talks.  I'm of  the  school  in  interpretingthe  market's reaction  to  trade talk  announcements  that believes  theexplicit,  mundane, and mechanical,  however strongly articulated, e.g."we are  imposing a 60-day deadline,"  the  foreign  exchange market,dollar/yen, can  shake  that  off  fairly easily.  What  is  harder  tointerpret  is  what happens  when the  announcements  come  in  a setting orcontext  that  the  overall Japan/U.S.  relationship or  the  overalleconomic  relationship  including exchange  rates and trade  flows  is  atstake,  and that's  what  is  being argued  about here  or  that's why thisannouncement  is being made.  That  then  tends  to  undermine  theconfidence  in dollar/yen and the  confidence  that  the  Administrationwould  stick to  a stronger dollar rhetoric.  So  I think  that  there  is  anuance that  the market  is  really very quick at picking up  on, whetherthe  announcements  are  couched  in  this  broad overall  relationship orwhether they  are couched in  the  specifics  of  the  trade announcement  athand.  I think that  on reflection,  the  end of  July announcement by theU.S. side was  seen  in  the  mechanical  context.  The  market  reactednegatively actually to  the  Japanese announcement  that  they would walkaway on  September  30th  if  sanctions were  imposed.  Now, thatannouncement  fell  on what probably is  the  thinnest  foreign exchangein early August.  [Laughter]  The big reaction we  got was  clearlyrelated to  the fact  that  no  one was  trading  there.  Some  people  stayedin New York Sunday  afternoon  to  sell  into it  and  see what was  there.I think everyone  then realized that was  60  days  away and 60  days  iseternity for  the  foreign exchange markets,  so we will worry about  thatin  the period to  September.  I will  say regarding  the period tonumber  of  members  of  Congress  write a letter to  the Administrationsaying they hoped  the Administration would be  tough in  the  tradetalks.  I think  the  foreign  exchange market  could very easily  focus  on8/16/94a date, but  that  is  the  sort of  thing  the  exchange market  can getriled up  about.  If  there were  even a modest  shift in  a few members  ofCongress choosing to run  on  a trade  issue  rather  than  a health  careissue,  that  could get  the  foreign  exchange market very engrossed  inthe  run-up  to  that  date.  I think that  could be  difficult.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let  us  move on  tothe  economic  situation  and Mike  Prell.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--SeeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In  looking  at  the  divergence between  thepermits  and the  starts  in  this morning's  release,  as  you know,  itcould possibly be  that  we had a significant  increase  in non-permitsingle-family  starts.  Do we have  those data  yet?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  No,  I don't have  information on that.  It's veryclear  the ratio  of  starts  to  permits  for  the  single-family sector isextended well beyond the  norm.  Given  the better  statisticalreliability of  the permits  series,  I think that  this  argues prettystrongly  for  starts  likely to have  been less  robust  than  this  reportsuggests.  But  we had a  level  of  single-family  starts  for  this  quarterin  the  forecast  that would still be  below any  reasonable adjustment,  Ithink, of  that  single-family  starts  rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions  for Mike  or,  Imight  say  for  that matter,  for  Ted Truman who has  no  formal  remarks  tomake?  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  in  the  Greenbook forecast  inventoryinvestment comes  down to  more traditional  levels.  And I think as  aresult  the  inventory/sales ratios,  if  I remember  them from Part  II  ofthe  Greenbook, also  come  down.  Would you  comment  on  the risks  to  theassumptions  about  inventory  investment because it  seems  to me  possibleat  least  that we  could see more inventory building  in  the  forecastperiod  than  is  incorporated  in what may be  a conservative  forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  it's  a reasonably balanced  forecast,given my  suspicion that  inventory investment  in  the  second quarter mayhave been overstated.  But  I wouldn't want  to make  too big a point  ofthat.  The  May  figures held up  very well;  they were  raised in  the8/16/94-4-revised  figures.  To  date,  there hasn't  been any evidence  there.  Butwe have,  in essence,  carried through  a slightly higher  level  of  theinventory/sales ratio,  that  having been achieved  in  the  secondquarter.  We  do  not have a  significant movement;  the  ratio begins  totrail  off  very slightly in  the  latter part  of  1995.  In  a sense,  atthat point we are beginning to  get  a  little  improvement  in  final  salesand we begin  to  see  the hint  of  a  restoration of what we  think  is  thesecular downward  trend  in the  overall  ratio.  We have anticipated inthis  forecast  that  the  adjustment  in  stock  levels  relative  to  salestrends  is  going  to  occur  in the  distribution sector, particularlyretailing.  We have  allowed in  effect  for  a  substantial degree  ofmanufacturing  inventory  accumulation, which  is  the  area  where we  mighthave anticipated  the upside  risk to  have  existed because of  thetightening  in  supplies  and  some of  the  pressures on prices  ofmaterials  and  so  on.  Certainly, no  inventory  forecast  is  without  itsrisks,  but  I think  in  this  case  the balance  is  not distinctly  on  oneside  or  the  other.  We  really are not uncomfortable in  that  respect.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I'm a little puzzled by  the projected levels  ofconsumption  expenditures and am  trying  to  reconcile  them with therelatively high  continued levels  of housing  starts projected in  theGreenbook as  well  as  the  further increase  in  light  motor vehicle  salesto  the  highest  level  since  1988.  That  just  doesn't  seem consistent  tome.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  A  compound question here,  I think.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  A confounded  question, I guess.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  No.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I'm confounded  at any  rate.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Let  me  try to  be  helpful with a  few, briefcomments.  I think if  we had  to  do  the  single-family housingconstruction forecast  again  today, we would still  have  in  essence  thekind of pattern we have, with some  further  erosion of  single-familyhousing construction  in the  near  term and  then  some  firming  over thecourse  of  1995--the  levels  in  the  two  years being pretty comparableand quite  decent  by historical  standards.  A  fairly high  level  ofexisting home  sales  is  also  likely  over  that  period.  We  have  seenvery strong  sales  of  appliances  and  furniture.  Even  through July,  theretail  sales  report  shows  considerable  strength  there.  We wouldexpect  to  see  some  ebbing  of  that  strength and  some deceleration  innon-motor vehicle  consumer durables outlays  over  the  coming quarters.At  the  same  time, we  think we've  reached a rather  low  level  relativeto  the plausible  trend in motor vehicle  sales,  in  good part  because  ofthe  shortage  of  some  of  the more popular models.  We  see  a  substantialramping up of  production  going  on currently and we  are anticipatingthat  sales  will move up  significantly in  the  next  few months,  and thenwe have a  slight upcreep  during  1995  with  the  continued moderategrowth of  income  and employment.  Our  sense  is  that  there probably  isstill  some  element  of  pent-up demand  in  the motor vehicles  sector,just  looking  at what  has happened  to  the  stock of  cars  relative  to  thenumber of  households  and  the aging  in the  stock  and so  on.  Ourforecast  for next  year,  at  just a  little  over  15  million  for  light8/16/94vehicle  sales,  is  certainly not high  by the  standards  that we  see  inprivate  forecasts  and certainly not  relative  to  the  hopes  of  theautomobile  industry.  I think  they will  have  the  capacity  to  supplythat many cars  and  this  is  not  an  extraordinarily high  level  ofdurables  expenditure  overall  relative  to  income  or GDP.  In  fact,  it'srather moderate  in  that  sense.  So  I think there  is  a reasonablerationale  for  this  path.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I have  a  couple  of  questions, Mike.  The  firstone has  to  do  with  the price  forecast.  How much  of  that  is  empiricalas  opposed  to  judgment?  I ask because  some preliminary work we'vedone  suggests  that  if  you  look  at  capacity measures  versus  measures ofprice  or wage  inflation,  they look pretty good into  the early  1980sbut  then  the  relationship seems  to  deteriorate rather  significantly.I'm curious  what you see  going  on  there.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  we have  at  least  59  varieties  of,  or  is  it57,  I don't know,  [Laughter]--57 varieties.  The  number  has crept  upover  the years,  of  econometric models.  So,  we probably  can encompassa pretty wide range  of  outcomes,  given  the  conditioning assumptions ofthe  degree  of  slack in  labor  and product markets,  the  acceleration orrising,  the  implications  of  exchange rate  changes  for  import prices,and so  on.  Our models have  not  done  that poorly  in capturing  thegeneral  trend of  things.  Our analysis  is  that  we  are  generally  in  theball park  of  the natural  rate,  I think our  forecast  looks  quiteplausible.  We have  sort  of  a  stabilization  of  the  core  inflationrate.  One  could say  that  there might be  some  offsetting influenceshere  of  abatement of  the  speed effects  and  the pressures  on materialsprices  that we've  had recently and some  of  the  shifts  in  the  influenceof  the  exchange  rate.  I think  this  is  not hard to  justify  at  all  interms  of  a pretty wide  variety of  econometric models,  but asignificant element  of  judgment  has  gone  into  this.  As  I indicated,we  simply  do perceive  a leveling out  of  things  that  have  occurred  inthe  last  several  months,  the  last  few quarters.  We  foresee agenerally stable  labor market  and level  of  industrial  capacityutilization  if  the economy  slackens  as  we have forecast.  And so  thebroad macro  conditions are  sort  of  stable  in  this  picture.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  My second  question--as  I understand the  forecast,you have  long-term interest  rates  coming  down next year,  is  thatright?  [Mr.  Prell:  Yes.]  How much precedent  is  there  for  a declinein  long  rates  like  that  in  circumstances  where you have  stable short-term rates  and a continuing expansion?  Obviously, we had  some periodsin  the  1980s when  long-term rates  came down  in  the middle  of  theexpansion but  short-term rates  were  declining through at  least  some  ofthat period as  I recall.  So  I'm trying to  look  for history and mymemory  isn't  that  good about  all  that.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think you probably cited  one period  in which wecould find  it  in  the  1980s,  but  I'd have  to  reexamine  that  record.I'm not  sure what  precedent one  would  look for:  What we areanticipating in  this  forecast  is  a moderation of  economic  expansionthat  extends  this  cyclical upswing with  inflation not picking up atall.  We  think that  the  implied real  rates of  interest,  given  the kindof  inflation expectations  that  presumably could prevail  in  1995  with8/16/94the  continuation of  3 percent  inflation, are  fairly  ample byhistorical  standards.  Even with  the nominal  rate decline  we have,these real  rates might  be regarded as  generous by historicalstandards.  Some might  say it  poses  the possibility of  a downsiderisk.  We  think that  there  is  probably still  an  element  of  extraliquidity premium in  the market--some  trepidation on  the  part ofinvestors.  People who  had been  throwing money into  bond mutual  fundswith abandon  until  a  few months  ago are perhaps  a  little more cautiousnow.  I think we  can get a  combination of  some  reduction  in  theinflation premium and  some reduction  in  the  liquidity premium  that  isprobably still  embedded  in  the  long  rates.  The yield curve wouldstill  have  an upward slope  of  some significance and  certainly wouldn'tlook  strange  in that  regard.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Of  course, we  did have a period  in the  second  halfof  1988  and  early  1989  in which  short-term  rates were moving upsmartly and  long-term  rates  were doing nothing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mike,  I'm interested  in your confidence  levelsfor  various parts  of  the  forecast.  Where  are the  surprises  likely  tobe?  If  one  starts  a year ago,  in  your  assessment  in August  andtalked  about  was  a middling expansion  and maintenance  of  the  lowinterest  rates necessary to  support  it.  You were more  optimisticabout long  rates  coming down  than was  the marketplace.  Your  forecastfor  growth wasn't  that much different  in real  terms  than  the  Blue  Chipor  others, but  you had more confidence  on  inflation and  long rates.What's  happened  since  is  that  we had a  lot  more real  growth, a  lotmore  employment growth, and a much different  structure of  interestrates, yet  your  inflation  forecast has  come  out very  close.  Whathappened to  inflation  in between has been very close  to  what  you weresaying  a year  ago  it  was going  to  be even  though  the  othercircumstances  associated with  that  inflation  didn't  obtain.  If  younow project  out a year  from now, what  in your  thinking  is  the mostlikely vulnerability of  the  forecast and where  do you  think thesurprises  are going  to be--on  the real  side  or  the  inflation  side?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I suppose  I should have  thought  ahead to  thiskind of  question;  it  comes up  frequently.  I don't  really have  anyclearcut  answer  jumping  into my mind at  this  point.  I think  there  arerisks  that  one could  identify in  every sector  and  I could  identifythem as having potential  on both  the upside  and downside.  So  I don'tthink there  is  any key  number here.  On  the  inflation--sort  of  thePhillips curve--side  of  things  given  the  outlook path,  we certainlyare  somewhat  at  sea still  about what  the  unemployment  rate truly  isright now.  There  is  still,  because  of  the  change  of  surveys,  anunusual  degree  of  uncertainty about  the  seasonal  [unintelligible]labor  force participation would change  radically  from where  it  is  now.We  noted that  we  tried to  come  to  grips  with the  news  that  we've  seenrecently, but  that  news  involves  a lot  of  interpretation.  And  so evengiven an  output path,  the  degree  of  labor market  slack that  thatimplies  is  uncertain.  Looking back  at  the  recent  experience  and maybeleaning  toward a slight  degree  of  pessimism, one  could argue  thatthings  really began to  firm--the  end  of  the  deceleration in wages,  thelack of  evident  further  deceleration  in  core CPI--earlier  this year,before we  got  the  drop  in unemployment  that  we've  seen recently.  This8/16/94might  suggest  that  more pessimistic  views  of where  the NAIRU  is,  suchas  those  embodied in  the  famous  Kansas  City Fed  estimates,  might becorrect and that  one could  see  some pressure  emerging  fairly promptlythat we  don't have  in  our  forecast.On the  other hand, as  I said,  the  range  of  estimates we couldcome  up with  in this  regard certainly  embodies NAIRUs  that  would bebelow what  we perceive  the  current  level  of  unemployment to  be  andthus  might give  us  a little more  room to  run.  We've got  a sustainedstrong  investment pattern.  We  think that  makes  sense, but  it  is  onthe  strong  side perhaps  of  what  some models  would  suggest.  There  isuncertainty about  inventories,  and certainly  in  the near  term,  ifthere were  enthusiasm  about building  stocks because  of  concerns  aboutsupplies and price  increases,  that  could  give  some  impetus.  We arecontinuing to  see  the  evolution of  the  recoveries abroad,  and in  thatkind of  dynamic  one  could be  off  the  mark in gauging just  what  impetuswe are  going  to  get  one way or  the other  there.  Given  our ownexperience  in the United  States  and maybe  once  things  settle  down, onecould see  a sequence  of  surprises  in a positive  direction.  Onhousing, as  we  saw this  morning, we've been  surprised;  and so we  couldbe right  or wrong  there.  I don't  feel  that  this  is,  on balance,  farout  of  line with  the Blue  Chip consensus  in  the  sense  that  they havemore growth  and more  inflation.  They have  higher  nominal  short-terminterest rates,  I think, ultimately perhaps.  But again,  that  is  alsoconsistent with more  inflation.  So  there  is  not  a glaringinconsistency  of  our view with  a lot  of  the private  forecasts.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Mike,  I have  just  a  simple question  about  thenews  since  the  last  Greenbook.  You mentioned  that  June and Julypayroll  employment came  in  stronger  than you  expected.  Do you happento  recall what was  built  into  the previous Greenbook for June  and

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  My recollection is  that we were  anticipating  thatthe  increase  in  the  latest  month would have  been 50,000  or so  less.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  July?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Including the  30,000  rise  in  the biasadjustment?  If  I'm not mistaken,  the bias  adjustment  changed from Q2to  Q3.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Without  an explicit  view about  the biasadjustment.  I think  the bigger  surprise was  in June where we  got awhopping  increase  in  employment,  and we  were, as  I recall,anticipating  something again more  in  the 200,000  area.  So  I think, wehave had a  substantial upside  surprise  for  those  two months.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Say, more  than  150,000  jobs  or  something?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions  for Mike  or  Ted?If  not,  would somebody  like  to  start  the  round table?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman, the reports  we have been gettingon  the  District  suggest  that  overall  economic  activity in  our regionis  still  growing at  a healthy pace.  My personal  sense is  that  therefrom earlier  this  year,  but not much and  there may not have been anyat  all  in  some  areas.  Some parts of  the  District, particularlycentral  and western North Carolina  and northwestern South  Carolina  canonly be described  as  booming in my view.  Moreover, some  of  the  recentcommentary we are  getting suggests  that  the northern part  of  theDistrict  and  the West Virginia  economy, which had  been  lagging behindthe  Carolinas  earlier  in  the  expansion, are now catching up.  At  ourboard meeting  last  week, directors  from both Maryland and WestVirginia gave particularly bullish reports  on  conditions  in  theirrespective  state economies.  In  this  regard,  I might  say  that  theadverse  effects of  cutbacks  in defense  spending, which of  course  areconcentrated primarily in  the northern part  of  the  District, while  notnegligible by any means,  seem  to have been somewhat  less  severe  thanmight have  been expected  earlier.  Residential  construction  is  offsomewhat  in the District as  elsewhere,  although there are  still  areasof very  robust  growth in housing,  again  especially in North Carolina.Offsetting at  least  some  of  the  softening we are  seeing  in  residentialactivity,  there  is  a  real  surge in  commercial  real  estate  activity.Leasing  is  strong  and in  many District  markets vacancy rates  are downand  there  are a number of  sizable  new construction projects  under way.Elsewhere,  activity  in manufacturing, retail,  and the  services  sectorcontinues  to  expand, according  to  the  reports we  have,  although  againperhaps  at  a  somewhat more moderate pace  than  a few months ago.  Onthe baseball  front,  we have  bad news and  good news  in  our  District.The  bad news  is  that  somebody has  estimated that  the  state  of Marylandwill  lose  about  $3 million in business  for  every Orioles  game  that  isnot  played.  The  good news  is  that  the  Richmond  Braves  are  stillplaying. And  if  anybody needs  tickets,  let me know  and I'll  see  what  Ican  do!Nationally,  it  seems  to us  that  the  economy is  still  quitestrong and we don't  think either  the  apparent  softening  in  consumerspending  in the  second quarter  or  the  recent  slowing  in residentialconstruction poses  a  significant  threat  to  the  expansion at  thispoint,  given what we know now.  Deceleration in housing--I  guess  thereis  some question  now with the  data  this  morning  as  to  how muchis  not  unusual  I would argue  for  this  stage of  the  business  cycle  andprobably reflects  the  satisfaction  of  pent-up demand  to  some  degree aswell  as  the  increase  in  mortgage  rates.  And the  slowing  in growth  ofreal  consumer  spending, after  all,  follows  three  consecutive  quartersof very  robust  growth  in consumer outlays;  and  it  seems  clear now, asMike  Prell  said,  that at  least  some  of  this  weakness  reflects  supplyconstraints,  especially with respect  to  domestic  automobiles.Moreover,  the  latest  reports  on  consumer  sentiment  suggest  thatconsumers  are not  backing off  in any big way.  As  Mike  said, thecontinued  strong  gains  in jobs  presumably are  going  to  support  growthin  income  and spending  in  the  period ahead.Against  this  background, the  Greenbook  forecast  certainlyseems  reasonable  to  us.  Our  guess  is  that  nominal  GDP may grow8/16/94somewhat more rapidly  in  the  second half  of  this  year than  the  4.7percent  annual  rate  of  increase  that  the  staff  is projecting.  Lookingahead to  1995,  the  key number  as  far as  I'm concerned  is  the  staffforecast  of a 3 percent  inflation rate next year.  As we  all  know thatforecast  is predicated  on  the  assumption that  the  Committee will moveshort-term  interest  rates up  on  an order  of magnitude  of perhaps  apoint by  early next  year.  I think the  staff is  right  in assuming  thatsome  additional  restraint  of  this  order  is  going  to be necessary tocontain  inflation going  forward, and personally  I think it's  importantto  begin that process  now.

MR. FORRESTAL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activityin  the  Sixth District  is  expanding moderately and we  continue  to  out-perform  the nation as  a whole.  The contacts  that we have  had sincethe  last  meeting indicate  that  their businesses  really are  doing  quitewell and  there  is  very clearly  an attitude  of  optimism both among thebusiness people and  the  consumers  that we have  talked to.  I thinkthis optimism is  borne out  and  confirmed by the numbers.  For example,retail  sales rebounded  in both June  and July and  they are  expected toremain healthy.  Apparel, which had been weak for awhile, has  beenespecially strong and again is  expected to  remain so.  On  the  otherside,  sales  of  durables  are beginning  to  moderate.  We have not heardof any unexpected  inventory buildup  in  the  retail area.  As  a matterof  fact,  some retailers are  telling us  that they plan  to  add to  theirinventory stock.  On the manufacturing side,  we did have a taperingoff  over  the  summer, but  this  appears  to  be  seasonal  in nature.  Thecontacts  in our  survey have  indicated  some optimism about  orders aswell as  production  six months  from now.  Inventories  here also  appearto be  in  line with  the desires  of  manufacturers, and several  contactsplan increases  in  their  stocks  of  materials  over  the next  severalmonths.  In  the  energy sector we  are  seeing better activity,particularly in  Louisiana.  The rig count  was up  from 127  to  136  inthe month of  May.  We  did have  some  tapering  off  also  in  single-familyhousing, but  this  has  been affected by unusually wet weather.  We  dothink that  there will  be  a continued deceleration  in  this  area.  Wehave had some unexpected strength in  multifamily housing  in  theDistrict.  There has  been a lot  of  in-migration to  the Southeast,  andrental markets have  tightened in many areas  and rents  are  rising.  Onthe  commercial  side,  absorption  is  reducing  inventories  of  space  andeffective lease  costs  are moving up.  Tourism remains  a strong pointin  the  local  economy.Since the  last meeting, Mr. Chairman, I've  spoken to  severalgroups  of  business people  around the  District  and there  are two  themesthat  seem to  emerge  from those  meetings.  The  first  is  that most  ofthem  are  reporting some  input  price pressures and,  for  the  first  timein  a long time,  I've  heard that  now to  some extent  they are  able  topass  those price  increases through.  The  second theme  is  that  they areexperiencing  labor  shortages, not  only  for  skilled people but  forsemi-skilled and unskilled.  In  our District  at least,  it's  across  theboard and  some  firms  are  actually paying  signup bonuses  even forunskilled people.  I thought  that  only applied  to baseball  andfootball players,  but  in  fact  clerks  are  getting them as  well!  As  anaside,  their  problem with  labor  is  exacerbated by the  fact  that asmany as  50  percent  of  the applicants  fail  the drug  test  that  the  firms8/16/94-10-are giving.  That  is  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  firms  have noticesup  on  the premises  that  they will  test  for drugs--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  suggests  that  the  literacy rateisn't  very high!

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  This may be  unique to  our District,  I don'tknow;  but  certainly  it's  been reported  almost  universally among  thepeople  that  I've  talked  to.  It  hasn't  translated  so  far  into a  lot  ofwage  increases,  but  I'm sure  that  will  come.  Just  a word on  thefloods:  The damages  from the  floods  in  south Georgia and  a few partsof  Florida and Alabama appear  to  be  on  the  order  of magnitude of  about$750  million, that  is  about  $250 million  less  than was  originallythought.  The  estimate  assumes  rebuilding and  replacing all damagedproperty and  infrastructure  but  it  does  not  include  an allowance  forlost  business  activity.  Most of  the  losses were  in  the  agriculturalarea.  The  flooding, of  course,  was  extensive  and  it  created manyhardships  for  the people  involved, but  the  economic  impacts were  quitelimited because  of  the  sparse populations  in  the  areas  affected.With respect  to  the national  economy,  I think  that  things  aremoving  along  at  a  fairly reasonable  rate.  Our  forecast  hasn't  changedvery much since  the  last  meeting.  We  continue to  differ with theGreenbook on  two  counts.  Except  for  the very near  term, we havesomewhat  stronger  growth  for  the  forecast  horizon than  does  theGreenbook.  And our  inflation  forecast  in  line with the  GDP  forecastis  somewhat higher  as  well.  We see  inflation  creeping up by the  endof  1995  to  the  3-1/2 percent  level.  In general,  as  I just  indicated,Mr.  Chairman,  I'm really quite pleased with the  outlook.  Of  course,our  forecast  also  assumes  some  tightening of  policy as  well.  If  wecan emerge  from  this  current  expansion with a somewhat  lower cyclicalpeak  in  the  inflation rate  and we  can successfully avert  a recession,I'd be  quite  satisfied.  Thank you.

MR. PRELL.  Mr.  Chairman, may  I simply improve upon my answerto  Governor  Blinder?  In  the  latest  data,  there were  upward revisionsto  April  and May payrolls  from what we were aware  of  at  the  time  ofthe  June Greenbook, a  total  of  about  100,000.  The  increment  to whatwe were  expecting  in June  and July  is  about  150,000.  So  the  totalincrement we have had  is  considerably larger than  what  I suggested.But  the  June-July increment  is  about  150,000.

MR. BLINDER.  Thanks.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  trends  in  the  Twelfth Districteconomy are  little  changed since  our last  meeting.  Employment  hasgrown  1 percent during  the past year with strong  gains  in many partsof  the  region offset by  flat  conditions  in California.  Idaho, Nevada,and Utah remain  the  three  fastest  growing states  in the nation  interms  of  employment.  Moreover, Arizona  and  the  Pacific Northweststates  are  reporting year-over-year  employment  gains  ranging from  2 to4 percent.8/16/94-11-Unfortunately, California's  economy still  shows  few signs  ofgrowth.  Employment  in the  state has risen  only  .1 percent on anannualized basis  since  December, and July's  level was  off  .5 percentfrom  a year earlier.  Moreover,  the  change  from a declining economy  in1993  to  a flat  economy  in 1994  has  followed a pattern that  does  notsuggest  an  imminent rebound.  The  flattening is  due more  to  acessation  of  large  employment  losses  in areas  such as  construction,wholesale  trade,  and local  government  rather  than  to  rising  strengthin other  industries.  In  fact,  there  is  only one  sector,  businessservices,  that  has  shown consistent growth.  Meanwhile, defense-related industries,  banking, and  communications continue  to  experiencesubstantial  job  losses.As  I'm sure  you  know, we  are at  the  current  time  sufferingfrom many fires  throughout  the  District.  It's  a  little early toestimate what  the  impacts  are  likely  to  be.  I don't  think  there willbe major  impacts  in  dollar  terms,  but we are just  entering the  fireseason, so  it  is  something to  keep  a watch on.Turning  to  the  national economy, our  outlook differs  somewhatfrom  the Greenbook for  the  latter half  of  this year.  We actually havea little more of  a slowdown  than was  incorporated  in the  Greenbook  forthe  second half  because  of  the  effects  of  the  tightening moves  so far,and also as  a result  of a decline  in  the  amount of  inventoryinvestment.  However  at present  levels  of short-term interest  rates,we  clearly would see  a strong bounceback  in real  GDP  growth next  year.Even with  slower growth  in  the near  term,  I have  significantconcerns  about  the  longer-term inflation  outlook.  Although estimatesof  slack are  subject,  as  we all  know,  to  considerable uncertainty, itseems  likely that most  if  not all  of  the  unused capacity in  labor andproduct  markets  has  been used up.  That  point  certainly was  emphasizedin  the Greenbook.  Given  the present  stance of  policy, we  are  runninga substantial  risk  that  the  future  trend  of  inflation will  be  in  anupward direction.  Inflation accelerates  in  1995  in  the Blue  Chipconsensus  and  in both the  structural and vector  auto-regressive  modelsused by our  staff.  In  our  structural model,  a significant rise  in  thefunds  rate  in  1996  is  required through  the nominal  income  policy rulethat  is  built  into  our  structural model.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman, the  Tenth District  continues  togrow at  a very healthy pace.  Construction activity remains  strong,although perhaps  somewhat  slower  than  the boom environment we  saw justa  few months  ago.  Manufacturing continues  to  improve,  especially  indurable goods,  and we have  seen  continued employment growth  there.Oil  activity appears  to be  strengthening  due  to  the  firming  in prices;that  is  no  surprise.  The  agricultural  sector will be  okay, as  recordyields  in  a couple  of  the  crops will  be  offsetting the  lower pricesthat  are  expected.  And the  cattle market  has  strengthened as  well.From what we  see,  our  economy in the  region  should continue  to  bestrong going  forward.I want  to  share with you some  data and anecdotal  informationthat  we  have on  bank activity  in our  District.  We  have  seen  someincreased  interest  in  the  use  of  the  discount window in  the  lastseveral  weeks.  For  all  District  banks,  loan-to-deposit  ratios have8/16/94-12-increased  from  about  56 percent  in March  to  an  estimate of  about  65percent  in  June.  At banks  that  inquired about borrowing,  loan-to-deposit  ratios  have  increased  from  around  60  percent  to  almost  75percent.  So we are  seeing some  liquidity  interest  there.  Thisreflects  loan  growth of  about  14  percent  in our District.  The reasongiven by banks  for  this  growth  is very strong  loan demand across  theboard, not  just  in agriculture.  It's  interesting  that  this  also  istrue  of our  larger banks;  some  of  the  smaller banks  that  have  come  andasked us  about borrowing have  indicated  that  their upstream banks havebeen  less willing  to  lend to  them because  of  their own liquidity needsassociated with outside  lending, which  is  reflected  in  their  increasein  loan-to-deposit  ratios  as  well.  This  is  supported  to  some  extentby  the  fact that  deposit growth  in  our banks,  on which  they relyheavily, has  grown at  about  half  the  rate  of  that  for  loans.  Also,both  the  larger and  smaller banks  around  the  District  report  that  theyhave  eased their credit  standards,  that  the  loan demand is  there,  andthat  the banks want  to  make  loans.  We  see  some heavy competitionthroughout  the  District  for  loans.  So  the  banking environment  haschanged,  I think rather dramatically, in  the  last  two years.On the  national  front,  we  like  others,  see GDP growth goingforward above  its potential  if we  leave policy unchanged and we  alsosee  the  inflation rate  pushing up well  above  3 percent next  year.  Sobasically, we are  in  agreement  with the  staff's  forecast  and see  someincreasing pressures  in  the  future.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr.  Chairman, the  New England economy continuesto  grow.  June employment  was  about 2 percent above  the  year-earlierlevel,  and  the  regional  unemployment rate  is  about  the  same  as  thenational  average,  with  rates  in  several  states well  below the  nationalfigure.  Looking  at  the  region,  there are  big differences  state  tostate.  Massachusetts  and New Hampshire  are  growing  above nationalrates  while Connecticut  bumps  along not  growing much at  all,  at  leastin  terms  of  employment.  Job  growth has  been concentrated in  theservices  industry, especially business services.  Construction  andwholesale/retail  trade  also have been  expanding reasonably  strongly.Services  jobs  are commonly characterized in highly pejorative  terms,at  least  in  the  First District.  And this  pattern of  recovery has  leftmany consumers  and businesses  skeptical  that  the  recovery is  for  real.Even more  sophisticated observers  of  the  regional  economy whorecognize  the  high quality of many services  jobs  find  themselvesfrustrated at  their  inability to  determine what  is  driving  theexpansion  of  these services  industries.  In  constrast  to historicalexperience, manufacturing employment  in New England has  fallen duringthis  recovery.  In  the  last  few months,  however,  the  job decline  seemsto have  ended and  our  informal  conversations  with regionalmanufacturers have had  an  increasingly positive  tone.  Firms  areseeing some  materials  cost pressures  and,  for  the  first  time  in a  longwhile,  some companies  are  passing these  price  increases  along.  Retailsales  are  fairly  strong,  though  the  environment  is  highly promotionaland margins are  flat.  Inventories  are said to  be  lean.  Our  littlecontribution to  the  inventory story here  is  that  one  major catalogdealer  just  ran out  of  the  items  that  everybody wanted this  summer.This  really puts  them  in quite  an embarrassing position  since  theysell  themselves  largely on  their ability to  deliver  things  in  acertain  short period of  time.  The one  area  that  is  showing  signs  of8/16/94-13-slowing  is  housing.  Contacts  report  that  sales  agreements have  fallenduring  June and July  in response  to  higher  interest  rates.  Statisticson  sales  and  construction still  look  quite good, but  of  course  theyreflect  decisions  that  were made  some months  ago.On the  subject  of  the  national  economy, based on  the  strengthof  the  employment  data over  the  last  several  weeks, we  think that  theeconomy may well  be  stronger  in  the near  term than  the  Greenbookforecast.  We would  expect  to  see  some  overshooting of  even ourestimate  of  the  NAIRU in  the  short  run  as  a result  of  that,  and wewould expect  also  to see  the GDP numbers  for  the  second quarter  at  4percent  or better when  they are  finally revised.  That  could meanstronger  third-quarter  numbers.  Over  the  longer  term, we  have  alittle different view than  the Greenbook  forecast,  particularly sincethe  Greenbook  incorporates  a degree  of  tightening that we  are notquite  comfortable with.  We are  interested, Mike,  in  whether you  ranany numbers  on what  a somewhat  slower rate  of  tightening might producenext year  in  the way of  inflation and GDP  growth.  I am  looking,  forexample,  at  the  DRI  forecasts, which tend  to  have  less monetarytightening, somewhat  similar  if  not  lower GDP growth, and  just  aboutthe  same  inflation numbers built  into  them.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think DRI  is  perhaps  in  the  lower part  of  thespectrum right now.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I think they have about  a half  percentage pointincrease  in the  funds  rate  in  the second half  of  this  year and nothingafter  that.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes,  they actually have  rates  backing  off,  Ithink.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Right,  I think they  have  some  modest  easing nextyear  and bond yields  come  down a bit more  than in  our  forecast,  andyet  they have somewhat  weaker  growth  over  the next  six  quarters.  Interms  of  what  a more gradual  rate  increase would produce  if  one  usedour quarterly model,  the distinctions,  as  I hinted in  my remarks,would be modest.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Too short  of  a period  of  time  perhaps?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well, we  are  talking  about  rather  smalldifferences.  A  1 percentage point  change  in  the  funds  rate  doneimmediately according  to  our  quarterly model will  only  take  severaltenths  off  GDP growth by the  second half  of  1995.  And  it  only means  acouple of  tenths or  so  on  the CPI.  So,  if  you  simply select  a moregradual  rise,  the differences  are  going  to be  even  smaller.  I guesswhat  we are  suggesting is  that,  in  our  judgment,  the  tilt  begins to  bemost  likely in  an upward  direction  in  terms  of  inflation right  now,that  is,  given  that we  feel  we  are  essentially at  full  employment.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes,  and  I think we  would agree with  that.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Faster growth will mean some  additionaltightening and  the probability at  least  of  an upward  tilt,  but  onlyvery gradually;  it's  a question of  degree.8/16/94-14-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Okay,  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The PhiladelphiaDistrict  economy continues  to  grow modestly, although  still  less  thanthe nation  as  a whole.  Retailing, bank  lending, and manufacturingreflect  this  general  assessment.  Employment  growth  in  fact  hasstrengthened some  in  the  District.  The perception, however,  is  stillone  that  jobs  are hard to  get,  and high profile  layoffs  are a majorcontributor  to  this  perception.  There  is  a  fairly widespread feelingthat  the  second half will  be  slower  than  the  first.  There  is  alsosome  anxiety about  how much  slower.  There  is  in  addition  some  of  theskepticism  that  Cathy has picked up  about  the  durability of  theexpansion.  Our  survey of  manufacturing  is  picking up  stronger pricepressures, particularly  in  the  metals  area.  More  generally, however,wage and price pressures  remain  largely  contained with most  firmsstill  emphasizing  cost containment  to  stay competitive.The national  economy, while  slowing,  in my judgment  is  stillgrowing  solidly.  The  growth in  employment plus  strength  in  equipmentspending and a  stronger outlook  for  exports  are major pluses.Negatives  or question marks  are  in construction  and inventories.  Onbalance, while  slower-paced growth  is  likely, the  risks do  seem to  bemore on  the  up  side  than  the  down side.  Likewise  for  futureinflation,  the risks  also  seem  to  be more  on  the  up  side  than  the  downside.  The  capacity utilization relationships, I  think, point  toward askewed upside  risk  for  inflation,  and also  the  signs  in  the pipeline--commodity prices,  prices paid, prices  received--and the  attitude  insome  industries  that  one  can indeed pass  along  some  cost  increases,  Ithink, are  blinking  caution at  this point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  With  respect  to  the  national economy,  I thinkthe view  that  GDP might  slow  to  a sustainable  pace without  furthertimely Fed action has  been resolved in  the negative.  Employmentgrowth continues  to  be  strong, retail  sales  held up well  in  the  secondquarter, and  inventories  remain low relative  to  sales.  At  the  sametime,  there  is  increasing evidence  of  inflation not  only in  the  narrowareas  that  Ed mentioned, but  I think in  the  broader measures  of wagesand prices  as  well.  For example,  the  implicit  GDP deflator  rose  byabout 2.8  percent  at  an annual  rate  in the  first  half  of  1994  comparedto  1.2  percent  in  the  last  half  of  1993,  which  is  a marked  increaseindeed.  Looking ahead,  for what  it's  worth, the  Greenbook expects  theCPI  to  rise  at  a  4 percent  rate  in  the  third quarter  and theemployment  cost  index at  a 4-1/2  percent  rate, albeit  there  are  somespecial  factors  affecting  the  latter  index.  Such  increases,  shouldthey materialize, will not  go  unnoticed  in  the  current  environmentwhere  there  are  increasing concerns  about  price pressures.Accordingly, as  I have  felt  for  some  time,  the  risks  are  clearly onthe  side  of  rising  inflation.  I would  also note  that  the  recentincreases  in bank credit  are  striking, with business  and  consumerloans  up  at  annual  rates  in July of  17  and 23  percent  respectively,and  that  is  a trend  that  has been building  for  some  time.  Growth  ofthe  broad aggregates has  picked up as  well,  suggesting money andcredit  conditions  that  are  quite consistent with  rising  demand  andinflation.8/16/94-15-With respect  to  the  District,  activity continues  to  expand ata solid pace,  albeit more  slowly than nationally  in  contrast toearlier in  the  expansion when we were  outpacing  the nation.  Asignificant  sector evidencing weakness  recently has beentransportation equipment.  However, following their annual  two-weekshutdowns during July, the District's major auto plants have resumedproduction at  or above  June levels.  While production  is  slated toslow again later  in  the year, this  is  attributed to  model  changeoversor plant refurbishings  and modernizations.  Recent declines  in  sales,according  to  industry  sources,  result  from exceedingly low  inventoriesin  certain models,  not  from  slowing demand.  It  seems  to me  that  thepricing behavior of  auto companies  confirms  this view.  Housingactivity remains at  relatively high  levels  in  the District,  with manyareas  reporting  shortages  of housing  for  sale  and rising prices.Commercial  real  estate activity continues  to  improve.  In Memphis,  forexample,  the  office vacancy rate  is  at a 6-year  low, and  industrialconstruction is  headed toward a 10-year peak.  Crops are generally  ingood condition  throughout  the  District, with  record or near-recordcotton and rice  crops  in some  District  states.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The Eleventh District  economy is  essentiallyunchanged from my last  few reports.  The tone  in  our directors'meetings  is  essentially unchanged.  The  tone of  our Beigebookrespondents  is  slightly stronger  this  time  than  it  has been recently.Price pressures  in  the District  seem to be concentrated inconstruction-related materials,  paper and packaging products,  and verylittle price  pressure  is  noticeable  in retail  stores.On important national  issues,  our  economists  tell me  that weare at  full  employment,  that  the  inventory buildup  is  largelyvoluntary, that  the slow growth in  the monetary aggregates  that wehave been having is  largely benign,  and that  the  risk  in  the  forecastis  on the  upside rather  than the  down  side both  for  real growth  andfor  inflation.  On  the weakness  in  retail  sales  that we have  had inthe  past  few months,  I might  mention that one  national  retailer basedin  Dallas reports  that  in  the  last  few weeks, particularly in  the pre-school  season, their  sales  have been excellent;  they have been  aboveexpectations.  They also  report  that price  increases  are  hard to  comeby.  I give you an  early warning, at  a couple of  our board meetings,our  banker directors, who all  tend to  be  representatives  of  smallerbanks  in  our  District--[Laughter].  Well,  it's  a long story, andhopefully  the  story  is  not  repeating, but what  they are  reporting isthat competition for  loans  is  getting very aggressive  and the  largebanks  are  so  aggressive on pricing and credit  standards,  that  theywonder  if  they aren't making  some  loans  that  should not be made.

MR. STERN.  The Ninth District  economy continues  to  berobust.  The strength remains  broadly based whether you  look atmanufacturing, construction,  natural  resources,  or  to get  the demandside,  consumer  spending and  so  forth.  Both the  objective measures  ofactivity  and the  anecdotal  evidence,  I think,  are  consistent with thekind of  performance we  saw in  the national  economy  in  the  first halfand  suggest  to  me  that we will  see  pretty good  strength  continuing  inthe  second half  of  this  year as  well.  Jobs  are plentiful  in many,many areas  both geographically and across  different  industries  andskills.  I'm struck by--business people  are usually anxious  to  sharetheir problems when  they  come across  a Federal Reserve  official,  butthey haven't had  a  lot of  problems  to  share  apparently.  There  are  twoexceptions  to  this  generally positive picture.  One  is  that  some  ofthe wheat producing  areas have  a problem with too  much moisture  andthat may affect  things there  and may back up  into  the  condition  ofsome of  their  lenders  as  well.  And home  sales  have  slowed a bit,particularly in  the  Twin Cities,  but  that  has  to  be put  in  the contextof  having come  off  two very  strong years  of home  sales  in  themetropolitan area.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  In parts  of North  Dakota and Minnesota where  theyhave  had a fair  amount of  moisture, yes.  It's  going  to  affect  bothyield and quality.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Does  that  spill  over into  Saskatchewan,do  you know?

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I don't  know.  With  regard  to  the  nationaleconomy, the  incoming data  haven't  affected my view of  things  from  thelast  meeting.  I think we  do have continued strong  growth  in demand.In  the  second half,  I see  the  economy probably  growing a bit  slowerthan  it  did  in  the  first  half,  but  I'm not  expecting  a  lot  of  slowingbased on what  I can  see  going on  here.  As  I hinted earlier,  I'muncertain what  this  means  for  inflation because the  relationshipsbetween capacity and price  or wage pressures  don't  seem  to  me to  be asrobust  as  they were in  the  early  1980s.  In  those  circumstances,  Itend  to  fall  back on  a few  things that  I think  I do  know having  to  do8/16/94-17-with what we  might  expect  for  labor  force  growth and  for  hours workedper employee.  When  I go  through  that  kind of arithmetic  in my head,  Icome  to  the  conclusion that we will  have  to  be  lucky  to avoid abuilding  of  inflationary pressures  here  if  I'm right  about  thestrength of  demand.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I noticed in  theGreenbook projection a  substantial  decline  in the  rate  of  growth  indomestic  final  sales relat ve  to  GDP, and  I think  that  will  come  true.I have distributed a  table  that  I've  based on  something I've beenplaying with  for a number years  since  I didn't  know what washappening:  It  involves  distinguishing NIPA personal  income  from  themoney that  households  actually have  to spend.  It's  based on  a  fairlyaccurate  theory that  you can avoid  taxes  nowadays, but  to  do  so  youcan't  spend the money.  [Laughter]  To  show  the  adjustment--I'm goingdown the  chart,  line  by line--wages basically pass  through to  cashflow.  Interest  does,  if  you  receive  it,  but most household  interest-bearing assets are  actually held  in  such  things  as  401Ks  and neveraccrue  in a cash  form directly  to  the  household.  And so  theadjustment  here  is  that  I  take  both  taxable  and  tax-exempt  interest,which obviously does  flow  through  to  the household, as  a share  oftotal NIPA interest.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  are you doing with imputedinterest?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  With imputed  interest?  Imputed  interest is  notcash  flow.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  I understand that,  but  it's  in  theNIPA.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  But  it  is  in  the NIPA,  that  is  correct--inproprietary income.  The same  thing would be  true  for dividends.  It'sa  little challenging because  a  lot  of  what NIPA considers  to  beproprietary income  actually may take  the  form of  business-typeconsumption.  And so  what  I do  again  is  to  take  the  share  that  thetaxpayers actually  report as  the  share  of  total  NIPA-based proprietaryincome.  With transfers,  I'd like  to  thank  the  Research Division here.I learned a  lot  about medical  transfer payments  which  turn out  to  be asubstantial  portion of  transfers.  I'm  taking  those out  because  ifMedicare reimburses your doctor  or  if  your  insurance  companyreimburses your  doctor,  you really  don't  see  the  check, so  that  istaken out  of  transfers.  The  same  thing  is  true with other  laborincome which  is  paid  into  pension plans  or health plans.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  are also directors'  fees  in  thatline  which should be  in  the  cash  flow.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It probably would feed  through  to  cash flow andI'm willing  to  stipulate  an  adjustment several  points  to  the  right  ofthe  decimal point  for  that.1. A  copy of  the  table  discussed by Mr. Lindsey  is  appended  to  thistranscript.8/16/94-18-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Barely.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Rent  and  farm  income--most  of  this  number  isactually  income on  owner-occupied houses.  I always  reassure  Susanthat we have  a higher  income  than  we thought  because we  live  rent  freein  the  house,  and  she  just  laughs  at  me because we  can't  spend  themoney and indeed  I believe her  when  it  comes  to  assessing  ourhousehold cash  flow.  The other point  on  this  is  farm  income.  Farmersgenerally have no  income.  It's  amazing that  the  industry  still  existsgiven how much they  report  on  their  tax returns.  The  government wouldregularly make money  in a budgetary sense by making  the  farm sectortax exempt.  But  the  easiest  thing to  do  for  this  purpose, as  far  asI'm concerned, is  just  to  zero  it  out.  I take  out  social  insurancecontributions  and personal  taxes,  and what's  left  is  the differencebetween disposable personal  income,  on  a NIPA basis,  and disposablepersonal  cash flow.  You'll  note  that  one  is  substantially below theother.  I  then compared that  to personal  consumption  expenditures.And, indeed, looking  at  NIPA we might  take  a rather  sanguine view ofthe household position because  in  fact  during  the  last year, which wasa very strong year  for household employment,  income actually grewfaster  than  expenditures.  But  if  you compare  it  to  cash flow,  andhere  I think it's  important  to  take out  the  third-party medicalpayments  that pay for part  of medical personal consumptionexpenditures,  the number  to  compare would be  205.2  in  spending versus155.1  in  cash  flow.  And it  suggests  that  in  fact  the  increase  inhousehold spending was much more  than  the  increase  in  the  actual  cashthat  they are seeing.Now, households  could do  this  for a  long period  of  time.Where  I see  this  as  of  concern  is  that  it  can't  go  on  forever.  Thedifference between cash  flow and  income,  in fact,  I  think  isconsistent with  the  double-digit rates of  growth we have been seeingin installment  credit.  The question  is  why are households  doing thisto themselves.  I think  the Michigan survey had good reasons  for  it.We created for  other good reasons  a great  buying opportunity in thelast  year  for houses  and cars.  The  survey  asked people why,  forexample,  now is  a good time  to  buy cars.  Well,  back in July of  1993,38  percent  said it  was because prices  are low, and  that percentage  hasfallen  to 28  percent, meaning prices  are  not  seen as  good  today asthey were a year ago.  On  the  other hand, a year ago  7 percent  ofrespondents  said now is  the  time  to  beat  price  increases.  That hasdoubled  to  14  percent  currently.  Another reason  to  buy now was  theexpectation  that  interest  rates would go up,  and that  number hassimilarly increased.  So  households  a year  ago  or  in  the  last  yearthought now is  a good  time  to buy cars  because prices  were  low andwere going  to  go up,  and  interest  rates  were  low and were  going  to  goup.  I don't  consider  that  a good indicator  for  the  future.  The  samething was  true with houses,  but  even  stronger.  The argument  thatprices  are  low  for houses  has  fallen  from  33  percent  to  19  percent  ina year.  The  expectation, on  the  other hand, that  now is  a good timeto  borrow  in advance  of  rising  interest  rates has  risen  from 6 percenta year ago  to  21  percent  currently.  For houses  as  well,  consumershave been  spending money they don't have  because we have had a bargain8/16/94-19-basement  sale  for  the  last  year.  That  is  not  going  to continue nomatter what we do  today.  Similarly,  I think businesses  have beenhaving a good time  in  the  last  year.  If  you  look at  the  differencebetween cash  flow  for businesses  and plant  and equipment  expenditures,it's  been running with cash  flows  substantially above plant  andequipment  expenditures  since  about  1992.  At  the  same  time,  there havebeen record-setting net  increases  in nonfinancial  equities and bondsoutstanding.All  that  put  together suggests  that  there  are a  lot  ofexpectations  of  inflation  in the  household sector;  there  is  asubstantial accumulation  of  cash, which presumably can  feed inflationin the  business  sector.  The question  is whether  or not  it  will  cometo pass.  So  I  think we are  in a very bad dilemma.  I think nominalGDP  is  growing  too  fast;  I think the  mix is  going to  worsen;  I thinkthe  consumer is  going to  spend less;  and we  are going to  have  lessreal  growth.  But  at  the  same  time,  I believe we  are  going  to  seeaccelerating inflation and  that  means  the good  times are  over and wehave to  stop  celebrating  and we have  to  make a  tough decision.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  First Vice  President  Conrad.

[SECTION]

MR. CONRAD.  Thank you.  The pace  of  business  expansion  inthe  Seventh District,  I think,  is  a bit more  subdued than  earlier  thisyear,  but we  feel  that  considerable momentum remains  when  the  supplyshortage  in  the auto  sector  is  taken into  account.  In  looking at  theauto picture,  the July seasonally adjusted annual  rate  of  sales  wasabout  13.7  million units.  That was  down from May and June,  but  it wasconsiderably  above June  1993--by about  7 percent.  That  continued toreflect  the  strength  in  light  truck sales  and also,  I think, benefitedfrom a boost  in  imports.  We  agree with  the  assessment  that  the weaksales  are  largely due  to  supply shortages  and not  to  a decline  inoverall  demand.  When we  talk to  the  auto  companies,  their build planswill  likely only stabilize  the  supply  situation.  Third-quarterproduction, which was planned  at  2.7 million units,  actually  isbeginning  to  seem a little  out  of  reach based on what  we see  in  termsof  start-up  delays.  We  think  that,  reasonably, production could beabout  50  to  100  thousand units  below that  estimate.  If  sales  doapproach  the  15  million unit  annual  rate,  which analysts areforecasting,  inventories will  probably remain below  the  55  days  thatexists now and could be  more  in  line  with a 40-day supply  for  some  ofthe more popular models.  On  the price  front  as  far as  autos  areconcerned, the  announced price  increases  from  the  Big Three  are  in  the1-1/2  to  3 percent  range;  that  is  about  $250  to  $500  per vehicle.  Butif  you look at  a weighted-average price  with respect  to  the  morepopular models,  3 percent seems  to  be  at  the  low end of  the  range  andit may be  a  3 to  4 percent  range.  If  you  look at  that  in  combinationwith the  reduction in  incentives, which  have been  reduced by as  muchas  40  percent, price pressures  have most  assuredly increased in  themotor vehicles  area.Not  all  segments  appear to  be  as  strong as  autos.  Reportsfrom District retailers  suggest  that  little has  changed  from thesecond quarter when  growth slowed  somewhat.  In  talking  to  our  largestretailer,  they looked at  second-quarter  sales  as  a small  setback, butthey  expect what  they  saw  as  a boring,  slow, middle-of-the-road upwardtrend  to  continue.  We  don't  sense  any concern about  retailinventories  at  this  point  in  time,  but  as  has  been mentioned by8/16/94-20-others,  intense competition  continues  to  hold down price increases  inthis  sector.  On the  manufacturing front,  steel  shipments have  sloweda little,  and that mostly seems  to be  coming  out  of  some  of  the plantsin  Michigan.  In  Chicago and northern  Indiana production and shipmentsare  holding up well.  Shipments  of  major home  appliances, which havebeen  strong, are  expected to  post  only a modest year-over-year gainfor  the  second half,  and  that would represent a small  decline  fromfirst-half  shipments  on  a seasonally adjusted basis.  Heavy truckproduction,  after operating  flat  out  for  the  last  two years,  isexpected to  decline  by a modest  amount  in  the  third and  fourthquarters.  There  are  some  slots  or  openings  for  truck production thatcould be  accommodated in  that  quarter, although overall utilization ofthe  stock continues  to be high  and rates paid by shippers  continue toincrease.  The housing  sector  is pretty much as  others have  reported.We have  seen a small  uptick  in multifamily construction.  In  the  labordownward during the  second quarter  and remain below the  nationalaverage.  A major  temporary help firm  reported paying  higher wages  toattract better qualified workers.  Another  firm suggested the  sameresult,  but also  indicated  that, because  of  competition,  they wereunable to  pass on  higher wages  to  their  customers.  On  the ag  side,District  crop  estimates  for  corn  and soybeans confirm  the  prospectsfor  a large harvest  this  fall.  Corn yields  are  likely to  be  thesecond highest  ever  and  soybeans will probably set  a new record.  Thisprospect has weighed heavily on  corn and soybean prices.As  for  the  national  outlook, our GDP  forecast  is  a bitstronger  than  the  Board staff  has suggested.  Employment  remainsstrong.  There  appears  to  be  little  slack, and we view the risk  astilted to  the up  side as  far  as  the  national economic  picture  isconcerned.  Thank you.

MR. JORDAN.  We contacted some  of  the  retail  operationssaid they had only a very smallheadquartered or  having  significant operations  in  the Fourth  Districtand asked  them about  inventory  situations.  Basically,  the  pattern wasthat  everything  is  okay. rise  in  their national  operation  inventories  and  it  was  allintentional;  they  felt  they  entered the  third quarter on plan.had  a very  large  increase because  they  said they were operating  toofar below desired  inventories,  and  they now feel  that  they are  onlyslightly below.  They entered  the  second  quarter 11  percent belowwhere  they wanted  to be,  and after  a very  large  buildup and goodsales,  their  inventories  are  only slightly below where  they want themto  be. but  they didn't  get  as  much  as  they wanted because  sales  growth turnedout  to be  stronger  than  they had expected--in the  double-digit range.said that  they wanted to have  a big  inventory buildup,had a more modest  increase  in  inventories,  about  4 percent,and  feel  that  they are comfortable.  So,  we got no  negative  storiesfrom the  retail  side on  inventories.  The  steel  sector  is  quitestrong.  They put  through a 5 percent price  increase at  the  beginningof  July  and it  has  held.  They are now looking  for a  further  3 percentincrease  in the  first  quarter.  They  are operating basically with a90-day delivery  schedule  and running at  capacity.  Nonresidentialconstruction  is  picking up  and that  is  helping  to push up  steel  demandas  well.  Companies  are  saying that  those construction managers  thatare  able  to  compete  in  the  dollar-based foreign market,  mainly Latin8/16/94-21-America and Asia, are  getting  significant increases  in  constructioncontract  awards,  and that  is  helping  exports  also,  especially capitalgoods.  Overall,  capital goods  and machine  tools  are quite good, bothdomestically and  exports.  Residential  construction is  characterizedas  having  leveled off  in most of  the  District, but  at  good levels  ofactivity.The bankers  talk  about big  increases  in C&I  loans--double-digit  increases.  Some  of  that  is  inventory  financing;  some of  it  isbusiness  expansion;  but  they also  report  that  consumer  and mortgagelending has dropped  sharply.  Smaller banking companies increasinglytalk about  being loaned out, and  the bigger banks  are happy to  hearthe  small banks  say that.  As  Bob Forrestal reported for  theSoutheast, we had an  advisory council meeting a couple weeks agoinvolving  a variety of  companies  from all  over  the  District  and  thesame  kind of  stories was  coming from all  of  them about  the difficultyof  hiring unskilled or  semi-skilled workers.  Companies  that  providetemporary workers  said  they have  a lot of  available positions  thatnobody applies  for.  On  the  other hand, upper-end positions--onecompany  said  that  they were  looking  for  a new chief  financial officer,and  they got  300  applicants.  They also were  looking for  truck driversand warehouse workers  and got virtually no  applicants;  maybe  thefinancial  types  ought  to  drive trucks.  High-tech  employment continuesto  be reported up, offset by healthcare  employment which continues  toRegarding  the Greenbook  and the Blue  Chip  forecast,  the  BlueChip  is  higher  for the  next year, as  it  typically  is,  for nominal GDP,real  GDP,  inflation, and  interest rates.  All  I can say  is  that  I hopethey are wrong on  some parts  of  their  forecasts and  I hope  theGreenbook  is  wrong.  I am still  troubled by  the  idea that  increasedemployment  or  increased output causes  inflation.  I think  if you wentback a year  ago  and took most of  the  forecasts,  whether it  is  theGreenbook  or  the Blue  Chip  or the Wall  Street Journal  forecast,  and  ifthey had  forecast  the  job growth and output  growth that we  have  had,they would have  said we were going  to have  a lot  more  inflationarypressure than we  have  seen.  This  idea  that we  need to  see a slowdownin  the  growth of  output  and jobs  in  order to  avoid price increases--Iam very skeptical of  that.When we look at  the  relationship between the narrowermonetary aggregates and  the  opportunity costs--the Board staffoccasionally gives us  a chart  on this  using M1  and we can  do  the samething with monetary base measures  and so  on--a year ago we were  in  asituation where  the historical  relationship was holding up very well.Looking ahead, we had four possibilities:  the  historical relationshipthat  simply stopped functioning;  a 25  percent drop  in  intermediate-and long-term  interest  rates--that didn't happen;  the other  twopossibilities were a sharp  acceleration  in nominal GDP growth or  asharp  drop  in narrow money growth.  We had actually a combination ofthose.  The historical  relation  today still  holds;  there  is  simplynothing that  has  broken down.  Now we  have a very sharp decelerationin reserve growth, the monetary base, and M1,  and with the  kind  ofinterest  rate increases  we  already have  had  let  alone  any furtherincreases,  that  leaves me with a feeling  that we  may be closer  to  ouridea  of  neutral  than some  of  the  other  comments  that  I'm hearing wouldimply.  I think  that  the  question of  whether we have moved early  andsubstantially isn't  as  easy  to  answer as  one might  think.  I happen  to8/16/94-22-think  that  the National Bureau's  timing of  July, 1990  as  the  cyclicalpeak was  simply wrong, and  that without  the  Gulf War, we might noteven have had what  qualifies  in  the usual  sense as  a contraction  orrecession.  Much of  the  last  three years,  four years  now, has  been aperiod of,  first,  the Gulf  War  and then  this restructuring phenomenon.Then  coming off  a level  of  3 percent  federal  funds with  the  kind ofinflation  that we are  experiencing,  a 125  basis point  increase  issubstantial  in what  in a different way  of  thinking  is  an early phaseof  the  cycle.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  With  respect to  the real  economy, I may be  ina position similar  to  Jerry Jordan's.  It  does  seem to  me  that we aremoving into  cycle maturity.  In many ways,  the  economy's  performanceis  about as  good as  it  gets;  the  economy seems  to  be hitting on allfours.  The  growth in  the  last  four quarters has been  above potential.We have had upward revisions  for  the  last  two  quarters,  and this  isdespite  an earthquake,  blizzards, and now  floods  and fire.  So we havehad plenty of natural  disasters.  We are  at  low unemployment, perhapsat  the NAIRU  if  it  really exists.  If  it  exists, we are  there.  Withrespect  to  inflation, the  recent  experience  clearly has been  good.  Ifgrowth is  close to  potential,  then it's  feasible  for  us  to  stay withina 3 percent  CPI.I thought I might  talk a little  about  the  financial markets;they haven't  been mentioned quite as  much  today.  The markets havebeen buffeted significantly this  year.  The  stock market,  I'd have  tosay at  this  point,  is  showing a great deal  of  resilience.  We  clearlyare off  the  January highs,  but we  are not  in  the  state of  fragilitythat we  experienced earlier  in  the year.  There  has been significantportfolio  adjustment,  so  I think that people  are  lined up on  bothsides  of  the  market now.  We  are not seeing  everybody lined up on  oneside of  the market, which I think was  the  situation  at  the beginningof  the year.  The bond market has withstood considerable volatility,and  I think one of  the  significant things  there  is  that we  haven't hadany major accidents.  I think  that a number  of  the players  havelearned how to  operate  in some  of  these  changed environments.Currency markets  also  have withstood significant volatility, althoughI'm not  sure  that  all  the  players have  learned as  much as  there mightbe  to  learn  in  the  currency area.  Banks  are aggressively  financingthe  expansion.There are  some  signs  that  the  expansion could continue  forquite  a while.  In  spite  of  the  recent runups  in  inventories, we arestill hearing  that businesses went  into  this  last  quarter in  a plannedposition, and many are talking about  adding to  inventories.  We areseeing  continued strength in business  investment.  The  order books areshowing considerable  depth.  We  are  finally getting enough  confidencein  the business  sector  to  see  significant  additions  to payroll.  Evenon  the  construction side,  although we  are seeing  some  slowdown inhousing, nonresidential is  taking up some  of  the  slack.  Earnings areholding up  significantly and  that,  of  course,  is  helping  to  keep  thestock market  fairly  resilient.  We may  even start  to  see  exportscontribute a little more  to  GDP growth.  On the  household side,  I doagree  that  expenditures are  likely to  level  off  somewhat.  Even so,  weare  seeing  credit use  up, and with employment  up,  that  is  likely tokeep  consumption  levels respectable  or  at  least  close to potential.8/16/94-23-It  seems  to  me that  the  risks  at  this  point  are  on  the up  side.  Wecould be  understating the  strength  in  the  economy.  I agree  that  thereare  still  some  downside risks  and  they certainly  exist  in  some partsof  the  country, but  they appear  to  be  outweighted by the upside  risks.The pundits,  kibitzers,  and Fed watchers  seem to  suggest  thatthe  Fed really doesn't  need to  worry about  inflation because  it'smild--3  percent--and it's  not  increasing, although many of  theforecasters  are now at  least  starting  to  show some  increase beyond1994.  But  all  that  means  is  that  the  Fed  is  either  at  the  curve  orthe  inflation  front.  We have  heard a  lot  of  stories  around the  tabletoday  about businesses now being able  to  pass  on price  increases.  Wehave seen  strong  increases  in the producer price  index forintermediate materials  for  the  last  four  quarters.  The core  CPI  forthe  second quarter actually  edged up  to  3.1  percent,  although theoverall  CPI  has  been  flat  thus  far  in 1994.  So  at  best, we  arestalled out  on  inflation and we  are  starting to  see  oil  priceincreases work their  way into  the  system.  I continue  to  suggest  thata  3 percent  level  of  inflation, even  if  you make  the  adjustments forthe  errors  in CPI  measurement,  still  does  constitute a  form of  tax  andsomething that we  should continue  to  be  concerned  about.  I think  thatone  of  the  reasons  that  we have been  able  to  see  inflation stall  outat  this point  is  productivity increases.  This has been  one  of  themajor  factors  that  has  kept wage  increases  from  infecting the CPI,  butthat  depends  on  a continuation of  this  supposed new trajectory forproductivity increases  that  we have seen  in  the  1990s.  So,  if  theproductivity increases  are not  continued,  that  will be  anotherpressure  that we will  start  to  see  on  inflation.  In  sum, I think thatthe  economy is  doing quite well.  We have a  chance  for  this  to  be acontinued expansion but  it  is  putting pressure  on  inflation.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I'd  like  to  pick two  nits with  the Greenbook.One  is  a  small  nit,  one is  big  as  nits go,  I guess.  [Laughter]Still,  I think  it  is  a nit  in  the  sense  that  the basic  outlook of  theGreenbook, subject  to  a qualification  I'll  come  to,  seems  about  right.The  first,  which really is  a nit, has  to  do with  inventories,especially retail  inventories.  I think  there  is  a hazard--althoughI'm  somewhat  reassured by some  of  the  comments  I heard  around thetable,  especially from Cleveland--that  the  retail part of  thisinventory buildup  is potentially dangerous.  Perhaps  I overstated;this  is  a cause  for  concern not  for  panic.  I don't  think  it's  goingto  snap  back up  in  any huge way, but  let  me  just  read you  two  phrasesthat  capture  what  I mean.  This  one  is  from  the Greenbook, page  4 andit  says  "there is  no  evidence  of  an  inventory overhang  at  this  time."This  one  is  from  the  DRI  report  that  came out  about  two  days  ago  andit  says:  "the  sharp  inventory accumulation of  all  goods  in  the secondquarter creates  an  inventory overhang."  It's  not  so  much anillustration  that one  organization knows a  lot  more  than  the  other,although  I guess  if  I had  to put  all  my chips  on  one  table,  I'd betwith Mike  Prell  over  Roger Brinner.  It  is  meant  to  illustrate thatreasonable people can  look at  these  data and have different  views.  Ifyou decompose  the  inventory buildup  over the  last  three  months,  Marchto  June,  60  percent  or  so  is  at  the  retail  level  on  the Board'sadjusted  current  cost  basis,  which happens  to  be  the  way the handoutreached me  two  days  ago;  I could have  computed  this  another way  as8/16/94-24-well.  The number was  $42  billion  at  an annual  rate  compared to  anaverage  in  the  three previous  quarters  of  $14  billion, and  the  $42billion is  the biggest  number  in a  long  time.  When I see  a numberthat  big on  quite weak sales  growth--negative  overall  on  retail  salesover  that period and 0.3  percent on  average per month  if  you take  outautos,  which  are  a special  case--and with the  inventory/sales  ratioscreeping  up not down,  I'm a little  less  sanguine  than  the Greenbookabout  the  amount  of  forward momentum  in  the very near  term.  Now, as  Isaid,  it's  not  a very big  deal.  I'm not  talking  about a  qualitativechange  in  outlook, only a quantitative change, but  it  is  potentiallyin  the  negative direction.My much bigger nit  to  pick came  in  the  second paragraph ofthe  first page  of  the Greenbook where  it  says  "labor and capitalresources  currently appear  to  be quite  fully employed."  I would havepreferred to  say  "not quite  fully employed, though  close,"  I pickedthe  words  carefully,  "not quite  fully employed, surely  close."  We areunfortunately at  one  of  those points  in  time  where even though we  knowwe don't  know these  things with precision and cannot  fine-tune  theeconomy, we  have to  make a decision  on  that  because we are very  closeto  capacity;  there  is  very little  doubt about  that.  It  matters,  inthis  context,  whether you  are  close on  the  down side  or  close  on  theup  side,  even  though it  is  hard to  tell  the  difference.  The view inthe  Greenbook--"quite  fully employed"--colors  a lot  of  what  comesnext.  It  is  reflected  in particular in  the NAIRU estimate, which inthe  Greenbook  forecast  is  implicitly, on  the  new measure,  6.3  or  6.2percent,  something like  that.  You  could subtract  .2 percent  for  thechange  in measurement, which is  the  Board staff's  current  estimate ofthis  very elusive number  and a number  that  keeps  on  shrinking.  Youwill  remember  the BLS  thought  it  would be  .6 percent back in January.I think reasonable people  couldn't  rule  out  zero  at  this point, but  .2percent  seems  a reasonable  estimate right now based  on what we  know.If  you  take  that  .2 percent off,  to  convert  to  the  old basis,  which isnot  only the way  I think but  the  way the  econometric  evidence  speaks,that  translates  to  an  old basis NAIRU of  6.1  or  6.0  percent  implicitin the  Greenbook  forecast.  To  me,  that  is  at  the  high  end of  thereasonable  range.  I don't want  to  say  it  is  an unreasonable  estimate;it  is  a reasonable estimate  but  definitely at  the high  end.  Myreading  of  the  evidence  is  that  a better estimate  of  the  NAIRU on  theold basis  would be  something closer  to  5.6,  5.7,  5.8  percent.  Irepeat  again,  these  kinds  of discrepancies  only matter when you arereally  close  to  the  NAIRU.  A  year and a half  ago,  it  didn't muchmatter which  of  those  numbers  you  thought was  more accurate.  I'd justlike  to  say I don't  think 6.3  percent unemployment  should be  theFOMC's  aspiration  level.  I have a  strong  feeling  that we  ought  to  beshooting  for  a lower  unemployment rate  than  that.  We had a  lowerunemployment  rate  than  that  for  the  last  three  months,  notincidentally.  As  I said, this  colors what  is  in  the  Greenbookbecause, commensurately with  that,  the  average  growth  rate over  thenext  five  quarters,  that  is  the  last  quarter of  this  year and all  of1995,  is  between 2.1  and  2.2  percent  in  the  Greenbook forecast--which,again,  I would have  thought  is  slower  than we would really like  toproduce.  It  is  not  slow if  you  think we actually have  had a smallovershoot and we  need  to  nudge  the  economy back down,  because  2.1  or2.2  percent  is  a nice  small  amount  lower  than,  say,  2-1/2  percentwhich would nudge  the  economy down a  little.  My  feeling  is  that  thatis  not  quite  the  appropriate policy given where  I think  the NAIRU is.8/16/94-25-However, while  in  some  sense this  is  a  "fundamental"  difference,  Icharacterized  it  as  a big  nit.The Greenbook  forecast  is  not  at  all  unreasonable given  thestaff  assumptions  about monetary policy  from here  to  January, that  is,another  100  basis  points  on the  funds  rate  built  into  the forecast.  Ilooked  at what  the  econometric models,  the  Board's  and others,  sayabout what  100  basis points  are good  for,  given  the normal  historicreaction of  long  rates  to  short rates.  Now, as  I think Mikementioned, with the  first  125  basis points we had much more  than  thenormal  reaction of  long  rates to  short  rates.  I  think all  of us  hope,and at  least  most of  us believe,  that  we  have a good chance  in thenext  ratcheting up  of  short  rates  to  get  less  than the  normalreaction.  But  just  taking the  normal  historical reaction,  100 basispoints  of  further  tightening  on  fed  funds would, after about  a year,knock  .7 percent  off  of  GDP, and after  two  years about  1-1/3  percent.So  on growth rates,  something  in  the  range of  .6 to  .7 per year  forthe  next  two  years would be  taken  out  by that  amount  of  tightening.If  you  add that  back in  to  2.1,  you're playing with a number  thatlooks  like  2.7  or 2.8  percent  on current  policy, and  that  seems  quitereasonable.  So,  I think the  staff  forecast  is  consistent  with thepolicy  that  is  built  in,  which  I've  already indicated I think producesgrowth that  is  too  slow.  I was going  to  say too  slow  for my  taste,but  I should  say too  slow  for  the  economy's best  interests.  I think--and  I'm taking  this more  from  the Greenbook of  six weeks  ago,  where  ifI remember  it was  quite  explicit while  it  was  more implicit  in  thisGreenbook--that  this  comes  from a very literal,  for my taste  tooliteral,  interpretation of  not wanting  to  let  inflation accelerate.We  don't want  to  let  inflation  accelerate.  That  doesn't  necessarilymean we have  to  stand against  a  10  or  20  basis point  increase  ininflation, especially given the  unwinding of  a variety of  factorsincluding the  speed effect  that Mike mentioned.  If  you  look  at  thecore  CPI numbers  in  this  Greenbook, it  is  3.1  percent  in  1993--this  isfourth-to-fourth--3.1  percent  in  1994,  and 3.1 percent  in  1995.  It  isa quite  literal holding  of  the  line  exactly where we  are,  and thestaff  estimate  is  that  it  would take about  100  basis points  more onthe  fed  funds  rate to  do  that.  I don't  think we  have  to  interpretthis  quite as  literally as  all  that,  and  this  is  a reason  that  I thinkwe should be  aspiring  to  a bit higher  growth  than  is  in  the Greenbook.Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I think  this  has  beena good session  in getting  most  of  the  factors  out  on the  table,  andI'll  try to  be  brief.  First  of  all,  I still  have  some  question  in mymind as  to  just  how much danger we  are  in here  as  to  inflation  beingin  sort  of  a scary take-off  zone.  I think there  are  still  someimportant  factors  that  are holding  it  in  check.  I would particularlynote  that  the  forecast  for unit  labor  costs  is  still  very  low.  Evenout  through  1995  it  never gets  much  above 2 percent, which  should be abig deterrent.  In  that  regard, even  though my bullish  forecast  onproductivity has  got  a little  egg  on  its  face  from  the most recentnumbers,  I'm still  optimistic that  productivity is  going  to  continueto  increase at  a significant  secular rate.  Certainly,  I think  it'sfair  to  say that we  haven't  seen much in  the way of  an increasedthrust  in  compensation, construction probably being an  exception  tothat.  Secondly,  foreign  inflation and  its  influences  continue  to  be8/16/94-26-low.  Inflation  is  low in  the  countries  that  basically have high costsbecause  they  still  have  big production gaps  that  are apparently goingto  stay in  place  for  the  indefinite  future.  Those  countries  that havehigher  inflation  tend to  have very low cost  structures  in  the  firstplace,  so  they ought  to  be  able  to  keep the  pressure  off prices.  SoI'm not  sure how much  imminent danger we  really are  in,  that  there  ismore  than  just  a troughing  or perhaps an upcreep  in prospect.  But  forall  of  that  having been said,  it  is  clear  that  we  are  either at  orvery, very near capacity, however that  is  defined, and  there  is  a  lotof  momentum present  that  shows  every prospect  of  carrying  us pastthat.  As  a consequence,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  risks  are clearly  onthe  up side both  for  activity and  inflation.  I'm put  to mind  of anold  saying of my mother's  who used to  like  to  say to her  children,  "astitch  in  time  saves  nine."

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let mespeak briefly about  the  economy in  the  Second District;  it  continuedto  expand over  the past month, but  we are  seeing  some weak  spots,especially in  the  state of  New York.  Payroll  employment  declined atan  annual rate  of  1 percent  in  June in New York State  and  2 percent  inNew York City.  There were  some rather  large  declines in manufacturingjobs  in many areas  throughout New York State.  Continuingannouncements  by manufacturers  of  additional  cuts  suggest weakness  inNew York State manufacturing employment  for  some  time  to  come.  Thelatest  announcements,  each referring  to worldwide  staff,  were a  10percent  cut  at Bausch  and Lomb and  further paring at  IBM and  a majorpharmaceutical  company.  Trading  losses  and dampened bond marketactivities  spurred  layoffs  in  fixed income  departments  at  three majorsecurities  firms  and additional  cuts  appear  likely.  Multiple  mergersand acquisitions within the  thrift  industry also  are  taking theirtolls  on  the  job count.  In contrast, New Jersey added  another 10,000jobs  in June,  and  I'm not  sure  what  the  split  is  between  Ed Boehne'sDistrict  and mine,  but  that  is  an  annualized gain of  2.9  percent.Manufacturing  employment has been  stable  for  the  past  three months,and  small  job gains accrued  in most  other sectors  of  the  economy.  Sowe now have  an unemployment rate  that has  fallen  to  6.4  percent  in NewJersey, just  above  the  national  figure,  an unemployment rate  in NewYork  State of  7.1 percent  and  in the  City 8.8  percent.  One  of  thethings  that  I've been  learning  as  I have been traveling  around NewYork State  is  that  there  is  a growing malaise  in  the  businesscommunity, a belief  that  New York  State  is  not  a particularly goodplace  to  run  a business.  That  has  led to  some  of  the moves  toConnecticut  and to New Jersey by  the  financial  industry.What  I think  is  a somewhat  greater  concern, but  I don't  knowenough  about yet,  is  that  in the  tier  of  the  State between Albany andBuffalo where  there had been a rather  successful  transition  frommaking carpets  and clothing  to  rather  more computerized activitieslike  check  clearing both by  the  Fed and  by the major New York banks,one  of  the major attractions  of  that part  of  New York State  was  thequality of  life.  If  you  don't mind a  lot  of  snow, it  has  kind of  anidyllic  climate,  a beautiful  countryside,  and a very  fine  lifestyle.That  has  changed or  is  in  the process  of  changing  largely as  a  resultof people doing what would appear  to  be good  things,  and  that  isputting correction  facilities  and prisons  in  that part  of  the  state.However, the  families  of  the  prisoners  and  the kids  in the  correction8/16/94-27-units  also move  into  the  community and  it  has  transferred  something  ofan  inner city to  unlikely places  like Rome, Utica, Rochester,  andSyracuse.  That  is  switching  off  the businessmen  from thinking  thatthis  is  a particularly  friendly place to  situate  themselves  in orderto grow, and  they don't  have to  go particularly  far because  they areseeing Pennsylvania, which  isn't  too  far away, as having  a somewhatfriendlier environment.  I think if  there are  two  states  in  thecountry where you wouldn't wish to  have  a malaise,  they would beCalifornia and New York, or at  least  those  would be  two  of  the  threecandidates  with Texas probably.  We  are  going to  have  to  continue  towatch what's happening  in the  State of New York because  the  trend isnot  a very happy one.On  the  national  level,  our  staff  forecast  is  so  close to  theGreenbook  that  it  is  something  of a rounding error  even  to  talk  aboutit.  Our  staff  forecast  is  somewhat more  benevolent on  inflation  inthe  second half  of  this year,  but that  appears  to be more  thananything else  that  the  Greenbook is  somewhat more  concerned aboutincreasing energy prices  than we  are.  So,  for  example,  next year wehave  real  GDP growing at  2.1  percent  and the  Greenbook  is  exactly  inthe  same place.  The main  difference  is  that we don't  think  it's goingto  take quite as  much  official action:  We have  the  same macro resultswith  a funds  rate of  5-1/4  percent whereas  the  Greenbook, as  you know,has  a funds  rate  of  5-1/2  percent.  We have  the CPI  at 2.9  percent andthe  Greenbook has  it  at  3.0  percent.  In  looking at  these  forecastsmyself,  I'm somewhat more  optimistic  than either  the  Greenbook or myown  staff,  and I think the  difference  largely is  that  I am really verystrongly convinced that  by historical  reference this  FOMC  is wellahead of  past experience  in taking appropriate monetary policyactions.  If we  continue to  do  the right  things, perhaps evenincluding  today, at  some stage  that  is  going  to become more apparentto  the practitioners  in  the  economy, and  I think  that  we have  a prettygood shot  at  that.  If  that  is  true,  although  the numbers would not begreat,  the  significance  I think would be  substantial.  I think wecould get  somewhat better economic growth of  the  kind that AlanBlinder was  talking about  at  a somewhat  lower  rate of  inflation.  Irecognize  that that  would be  a very happy outcome and one  always  hasto  try to  abstract  one's wishes  from one's  analysis,  but I do  thinkthat  there  is  a significant possibility  that we could  achieve that.

MR. LAWARE.  Mr. Chairman,  the  learned comments  of  ourcolleagues  have been so  encompassing  that  they leave me with  littleadditional wisdom  to  share with the  Committee.  My personal view isthat  the economy may be  more  robust than  the Greenbook  forecast wouldimply.  I continue to  believe  that consumer  uncertainties about  jobsecurity and about what  government  is  up  to  tend  to be  a dampinginfluence  and a counter to  runaway growth.  However,  I think  thecurrent brisk  rate of  growth  argues  for  some further  braking frompolicy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Two  issues are  of  importance  to me  in  assessingthe  current  economic  situation.  First,  how much momentum is  there  inthe expansion  and second how much slack  is  in  the  economy, how closeis  it  to  potential  output?  With respect  to  the  issue  of momentum,  I8/16/94-28-find myself  largely  in agreement with  the  staff  analysis presented inthe Greenbook.  Real  growth is  slowing, but  I do  think there  remainsenough momentum to keep aggregate  demand growing at  a rate  somewhat inexcess of  the  growth  rate  of  potential  output long  enough  to push theeconomy  above potential  in  the  absence  of  some  further monetaryrestraint.  My own  estimate  of  the  degree of momentum  in demand hasincreased over the  last  few months.  Most  important  in my  thinking,the decline  in the  value  of  the  dollar and upward revisions  inestimates  concerning the  strength of  foreign economies will  bereducing  the drag on demand that  stems  from net  exports.  In  line withthe  staff  forecast,  I also  expect  the  declining dollar to  feed throughto  some mild upward pressure on  import  prices.  Now that  the economyis  close  to  potential, higher import prices  should create a bit morescope for American producers  of  import  substitutes  to  raise  their  ownprices.  I don't want  to  overemphasize  the  impact of  the  dollarin the  context  of  an  economy  that  is  nearing potential,  this  seemslike a source of momentum.  And I see  these  international  factors  asoffsetting to  some  extent  the moderating  influence  of higher  interestrates  on housing  and consumer durables  spending.  The  strength of neworders  for  durable goods and  the  strong profit projections  suggestcontinuing strength in investment,  and the  staff  analysis  convinces  methat  there  are risks  that  the  slowdown  in demand  could beinsufficient,  absent some  further  tightening to prevent  overheating.With respect  to  the  issue  of how close  the  economy is  topotential,  I confess  uncertainty here.  Nevertheless, on  the basis  ofboth econometric  and anecdotal  evidence,  it  seems  to  me  that  outputhas  not yet passed potential,  although we are  approaching  it.  I don'tyet  see  strong enough indications  of  tightness  in  labor markets,  orenough signs  of  increasing wage pressure,  or sufficient  indication ofa pickup in  the  growth of unit  labor costs  to  conclude that  we haveventured beyond potential.  Capacity utilization is  high by historicalstandards, but  investment  also  is  adding  to  capacity at  a rapid rate.I see  only  scattered evidence  of  lengthening  lags  in  filling  orders.On balance,  I'd  say my sense  is  that  the  economy could stay where  itis  in  terms  of  unemployment  or  even shave a few tenths more  off  theunemployment  rate without risking significantly a pickup  in  inflation.This  inclines me toward the  feeling that  there  should be  sometightening  of policy  to  reduce momentum, but  somewhat  less  than  theGreenbook  assumes.  The  Greenbook  forecasts  for  real  growth in  1995are  somewhat  too  low  in my  opinion to  end up with an  economy  in  1995that  is  operating near enough  to potential.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Don?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Don,  I interpret  the  recommendations  you makevis-a-vis  the  arguments  that  go with it  as  implying disagreement with8/16/94-29-the  Greenbook.  The  reason  I say that  is  because  if you  accept  theGreenbook  projections--the output  and  the  inflation numbers  through1995--the  objectives  of  the  Committee and the  logic  that  we are at  orclose to  capacity and  the  NAIRU and that  a 5-1/4  percent  funds rate  isneutral  in the  sense  of maintaining  the  inflation  rate  let alonebringing it  down,  that would lead you  to  recommend  100  basis pointstoday, and you don't do  that.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  First  of  all,  I think  the  function  of  the Bluebookis  somewhat different  from that  of  the  Greenbook, at  least  I conceiveit  as  such,  and  that  is  to  take  the  alternatives  that  I think  theCommittee will be  seriously considering  and  say what we think  theshort-  to  intermediate-term consequences  of choosing  thosealternatives will  be in  financial  markets  and to  a lesser  extent  inthe  economy and give  the  Committee pros  and cons  on  each of  thealternatives.  The  latter are  then amplified in my briefing to  giveyou some  things  to  think about  leading up to your  decisions.  It  istrue  that one  alternative might be  to  take  the  funds  rate up  100  basispoints  right now.  I didn't  see  that  as  a viable  alternative.  I'm notsure,  given the  uncertainties,  that  even  the Greenbook would be  infavor of  something that  large  right  away, surprising the markets by asmuch as  that.  But  I can see  your argument;  it's  like  the  argument  oflast  February.  If you think you have  to  go  a percentage point andyou're reasonably confident  in  that,  the  longer you take  to do  it,  themore uncertainty  there  could be  in  the market  and the  less  likely youmight  be  to  get your  outcome.  But  it  just  didn't seem  to us  to  be oneof  the  alternatives  that  the  Committee would be  considering seriously.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any other  questions  for Don?  If  not,let  me get  started.  Let me  just  say first  that after  listening to  theroundtable discussion  and  looking at  the  usual  long sets  of  figures,what  I come  away with  is  that despite  the  longevity of  this  recovery,there  really are  few signs  of  aging.  There  are marginal  evidences  ofimbalances, marginal  evidences  of  pressures, but  in  general  it  stilllooks  as  though this  recovery has a considerable set  of  momentumsassociated with it.  First  of  all,  profit margins  are  still  rising andindeed, they are  coming in  above expectations.  That  is  anextraordinarily rare characteristic  for  the  latter stages  of  abusiness expansion.  Inventory/sales ratios  are  low, especially if  onestrips  out  the  trade markups  to produce  constant  dollar  factory valuesof  inventory/sales  ratios.  Those ratios have been coming down verydramatically as  the  "just-in-time" processes  have accumulated at  afairly substantial  pace.  I suspect  that  we  finally hit bottom in  thespring with  "just-in-time."  That  is,  the  room for  further declines  ininventory/sales ratios  has become very significantly  limited and, as  aconsequence  of  that,  the process of  going to  zero  change means  a boomin inventory  investment.Unquestionably an  important concern here  is whether we  arelooking only at  the  end of  "just-in-time" or  looking at  inventoryinvestment  that  is  substantially unintended and  that  could back up  asthe  DRI  overhang analysis  suggests.  First  of all,  we  do know  that  asubstantial  part  of  the  inventory change,  especially in  the  tradearea,  is  imported goods.  Internal  estimates by Board staff  indicatethat  imported goods  accounted for  roughly  1/3  of  the  inventory changein April  and May.  This  obviously means  that  to  the  extent  the  addedinventories  came  from imports,  to  the  extent  that  there  is  anyunintended inventory accumulation there,  it  is  the  imports and the8/16/94-30-foreign producers  that get  backed up, not  domestic.  Secondly, ifthere were a significant  element of  unintended inventory accumulationhere, we really would expect  to begin  to see  it  in  the new ordersseries.  A goodly  chunk of  the  inventory  accumulation is  clearly verydirectly  intended inventory accumulation, because a lot  of  it  is  incapital  goods  areas  where  the order patterns have been very strong.But  from anecdotal  evidence on  orders  and the  actual detailed CommerceDepartment data on  orders,  it  is  very difficult  to make  the case  thatthere  is  any  significant  element of  unintended inventory accumulationin  these numbers.  I think there  is  some evidence on  the  basis  ofinventory numbers  that orders  for  furniture  did back up a little, butit  is  really at  the margin  and very little evidence  suggests  that wehave  a particular problem  there.  We  also  are not  seeing evidence  inthe  inventory structure  of  any serious  difficulty even  on  the  otherside.  It's  true  that  there  has been slowing down  in deliveries,  butlead  times  on new orders have  shown very little  evidence of  rising,especially in the  production materials area.  And so  it  is  suggestivethat we neither have an  exceptionally  tight  inventory situation  or  aloose  one.  That  seems  consistent with a middle  stage  of  the businesscycle, one  that  is  neither negative nor particularly positive.I do  think we  are getting some  slowdown in  the rate  ofgrowth, but  the  crucial question is  from where?  We  tend  to  look atthe  gross  domestic product as  the  measure of  what  the  economy  is  doingand there  is  some  serious question in  the  last  two  or  three  quarterswhether  or not  that  is  low-balling  the  rate  of  growth.  As wediscussed previously,  looking at  gross domestic  income, which  isconceptually equivalent and  leaving aside  the  issue  of very weak datafor  the  second quarter,  the  growth in  gross domestic  income wasseveral  tenths  above  the  growth  in gross domestic  product  in  thefourth quarter and  the  first  quarter.  Disaggregating the  grossdomestic product  into  the value of  industrial production and  "allother" and  substituting the  industrial  production index  for the  valueof  industrial production as  a conceptually equivalent measure  ofaggregate  growth,  again we get  stronger  growth than  is  in  the  GDPnumbers.  What  this  is  indicating  is  that we have  to  be  a littlecareful  about  these measurements.  For example,  I find utterlynoncredible  the probability that,  in  the real  world, productivityget  an  expansion in the  economy, leaving aside  its nature, and you  getrising profit margins,  you begin to  wonder where  the profit  marginrise  is  coming  from.  It  clearly  is not  through  increases  in prices.The  question basically is  how to  reconcile  this  situation  in which weget  this  huge  increase  in work hours  and therefore  in  compensation ofemployees  against a slowed GDP  that  suggests,  other  things equal,  thatlittle  suspicious  of  the GDP  figures,  although  I grant  that  theunderlying work hour  figures  themselves  may be  exaggerated in thesecond quarter.  But  it  is  very hard to  reconcile  the  anecdotalevidence and the  basic  data with which we  deal  to believe  thoseproductivity  data, and  that  is  one more  reason at  least  to wonderabout  some  of  the GDP  figures.In  the  current period,  there  is  very little  doubt  that we arenot  getting a significant  amount  of  deterioration.  I think it  iscertainly the  case  for  the  interest-sensitive  sectors--residentialconstruction  and to  whatever extent we  can say that  weakness  in motorvehicle  sales  is  other  than  shortages.  I think there  was  a very8/16/94-31-persuasive case  put  forward by Mike  Prell's  associates  at  a Boardmeeting the  other day that  a very large part of  the  decline  in motorvehicle  sales  is  the  result of  shortages  and not  a basic weakness  indemand.  Nonetheless,  I think one  must  argue  that there  is  a slowingdown  in that particular  area, and  it  is  being offset, probably notfully, by expansions  in  the  capital goods  markets,  which I suspect mayagain be underestimated in  the GDP  sense  in constant  dollar  termsbecause  the  communications  equipment prices  just do not  lookrealistic,  as  a number of people  are beginning to  conclude.  Thissuggests  that real producers  durable  equipment  is  probably rising at  afaster pace.  It may also  imply,  I might say parenthetically, that  thecapacity measures may also  be affected on  the  up  side.  However,  Ithink we  are  getting  clear evidence  of  improving world economic  growthvis-a-vis  our earlier views,  which suggests  that  the  export marketsare  moving and doubtless  the  exchange  rate will  have  some  impact  thereas  well.  The drag from nonresidential  construction  is  clearly at  anend.  The  indications  that values of  commercial  real  estate arebeginning to  stabilize  and are  beginning to  move up  in certain localareas  are  consistent with  the  beginning  of  a turn  in  office and othercommercial  construction.  We  are  running  through  the backlogs  of  verymajor deterioration in  the  nonresidential building area,  and  I thinkthat  sector will  cease  to  exert weakening pressures.  Very currently,we  are  seeing  initial  claims  for unemployment insurance  that  are quitelow,  and that  suggests  that  the  labor markets  are  doing rather well.Growth in employment  seems  quite significant.  Not only are  ordersstrong but  there  is  impressive  evidence  that  unfilled orders  areaccelerating  on  the up side both in  current  and constant  dollars.  Astatistic we  don't  talk about  very often, but  it  is  not irrelevantbecause it  is  a leading indicator, is  the  extraordinary rise  in  netbusiness  formation, which BEA  shows as  a fairly sharp  upswing--againsomething not  consistent with a late  stage  of  the business  cycle.  Soit  strikes me that,  as  Don Kohn puts  it,  with  the  reverse head windscoming  in the bank credit  data,  loan data,  and the  like,  it  isbeginning to  get  a little nervous-making,  I must  say.  This  stuff  isreally beginning  to move.All  in  all,  it  is  very difficult  to get  around the  generalnotion  that,  even  though  there  is  some  evidence of  a slowdown  in  therate  of  growth, it  still  appears to be  coming in  at a somewhat  higherlevel  than I suspect we are  used to  looking at,  if  all we  are  lookingat  is  the  gross  domestic product  figures  themselves.  Also,  there  isan underlying momentum here  that  suggests  there  are  a couple of  biglegs  left  in  this business  cycle.I think one has  to  conclude,  as  far as policy  is  concerned,that  another upward notch  in  rates  is  clearly called for at  somepoint.  Therefore,  the question we have  to  ask ourselves,  which is  notinconsistent with what  Jerry Jordan was raising,  is  if we  believethat, why not now?  I think  the question  really gets  to  a notion ofwhat we  expect we will  ultimately have to  do.  I frankly don't  knowwhether or not  the  staff's estimate of  a 100  basis point  increase  isthe right  number.  I do  know that  there  is  a not  insignificantprobability that  50  basis points may be  enough  if we do  it  now.  Idon't know what  the  probability  is but  if  somebody said,  is  it  .1, I'dsay  it's  a lot higher  than that.  Is  the probability greater than  50percent?  I doubt  it.  I think  it's  a third, maybe 40  percent, but whoknows.  I do  think  that  if we move  50  basis  points now, theprobability that  we will not have  to move  before  the  end of  the  year8/16/94-32-probably is  greater than  50  percent.  One  of  the  reasons  I say that  isthat  implicit  in the  100  basis  points that  they have  in  the  Greenbookis  the  fact  that  long-term rates  are  coming down and we are  getting anew sort  of  dynamic  in the  system coming  from residentialconstruction.  In  that context,  we need an upward adjustment  of  short-term rates  because the  shape  of  the yield function  is beginning  tomove closer  to  normality.  I'm not  sure  about where  long-term ratesare  in  that particular context.  But  I do  know that  as  we  look at  thesituation now, unlike where we were  in  the  early stages  of  ourtightening moves,  where remember I was  terribly concerned--maybeoverly concerned but  I doubt  it--that  if  we did more  than  25  basispoints we were risking the  stability of  the  system.  With  the Maymove, I think we  clearly demonstrated that  the  bubble  for allpractical  purposes had been defused, and that we needn't worry aboutlarger  increases  at  this  stage.  With the passage of  time,  I think themoving  of  securities  from weaker hands  to  stronger hands has  now madeit  far  less  likely that a 50  basis point move  at  this point wouldshake the  markets  in any significant  way, if  at  all.I'm a little  concerned  that 25  basis points  would merelyraise the  issue  of when the  other  shoe  is  going to  drop.  I am alittle nervous  about  raising  the  rate more  than  50  basis pointsbecause  frankly I'm not  sure we need it.  If  we don't need it,  thereis  no point  in doing it  and it's  an  element  of  risk  that  I don't  thinkwe need to  take.  My own view--I'm being  a little  more detailed than  Iusually am so  I hope people will  excuse me in  this  respect--is  thatit's  very important  if  we were  to  do  50  basis points,  that we  not givethe  impression  that  somehow we  anticipate major accelerations  and thisis  just  the beginning of  a long  series  of  50 basis point  increases.If  the markets believe that,  then  I think we have a very seriouspotential  of  creating a major negative market  reaction.  I think wehave  to  be very careful  to  avoid giving  that impression.  The onlyrealistic way we  can avoid  that  is  to  issue  some  type of  statementwith any move  that we make  that  implies  that we  are  in the  process  ofreassessing where we will  go--in other words,  our intention  to  holdfor a while without  tying  our hands, which we  cannot do.After  talking to my colleagues  on  the  Board of  Governors,  Ithink there  is  a sentiment on  the  part of  the Board  to raise  thediscount rate  50  basis  points  in line with what  a number of  theReserve Banks  are requesting.  I think  implicit  in  that,  in  the viewof  the  Board, is  to  request this  Committee  to  allow all  of  theincrease  to  pass  through.  Also,  I might  add, implicit  in  that generalpolicy view is  our adoption of  symmetric  instructions  to  the  Desk.The more  I think about  that as  a potential  sort  of  policy package,  theless  I like  all  of  the other  alternatives.  I started  off  at  either nochange and asymmetry  or 50  basis  points with  symmetry on  the  groundsthat  25  basis points  struck me  as  risking the  other  shoe  droppingsyndrome.  But  I must say,  the  more I listened to  this group  and yourcomments  on  the  elements  involved and  such  things  as  the  housingstarts  figures  this morning--incidentally, Mike,  the adjusted permitsif we  add back the  nonpermit  issuing areas are  down only  .8, not  1.7.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I just  got  these  numbers  at  the break  and I thinkthe picture  in  the  adjusted permits  and the  single-family  starts  isreally one  of  rough  stability  in the  past three months.8/16/94-33-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In other words,  if  we had a very weakresidential  construction area or  a weak motor vehicles area, I wouldsay we might want  to pause and do nothing.  But  I think  the  evidenceis  increasingly convincing that we probably need to do  50  basispoints.  I must  admit  that  I was  going  to  start  out more  even-handed  --on the  one hand, on  the  other hand,  if you will--but  I convincedmyself  to  steer  away from  that.  [Laughter]  So with  those  apologies,I open up the  discussion.  Bob.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman,  I think your  conclusion aboutthis  expansion having  life  in it  is  exactly right.  I certainly agreethat all  the numbers  and  the  anecdotal  information  that  we have  seenand heard this  morning would  indicate  that the  momentum is  stillthere.  As  a matter of  fact,  in our  forecast, we built  in  a 50  to  75basis point  rate  increase  and we produced a 1995  GDP  of  2.6  percent,which I think is  a desirable  kind of  deceleration in the  economy toappropriate  levels  much nearer  to potential.  On  the  other  side,  if  welook at  what  is  happening with  inflation, what  is  likely to  happen, wehave  strong consumer demand,  strong loan  demand, and the  economy isvery close  to  capacity.  We  have higher oil  prices  that  are  likely  toremain  at current  levels  unless Iraq gets  back  into the picture,  aweak dollar, and  the beginnings  of  labor  shortages.  All of  thesedevelopments,  I think, make  a very compelling case  that we  have  tomove.  I think the  sooner we  move the better.  I certainly support  thenotion  of  50  basis  points because,  like you,  I think 25  basis  pointsreally is  not going to  have  the desired  effect, and  it's  going tocause uncertainty in  the markets.  I also  am pleased that  the  Board isconsidering  a discount  rate  increase because  I think the  combinedpolicy actions  will have very desirable  effects.  So,  I'm completelysupportive of  what  you are  suggesting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman, I, too,  agree with your policyrecommendation.  Given my comments earlier,  I think  that  it  is  theappropriate action to  take.  I also  agree that  if  we only did 25  basispoints,  it would create uncertainty rather  than what  I think we  canaccomplish with this  move.  So  I agree.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I'm also  supportive of  the package  that yououtlined.  I just  want  to  take two minutes  to  emphasize  that  it  reallyis  a package.  If  we  are  going to make  this  kind of  policy credible,it has  to be with a symmetric directive.  It has  to  be with astatement  that  indicates  as  clearly as  we  can state  within the  limitsof  Fedspeak that  our oars are  out  of  the water.  That does not meanthat we have thrown  the  oars  overboard;  we  still have  the  oars,[Laughter]  but we  have pulled  them out  of  the  water.  I think  that wasimplicit  in what  the Chairman said,  and I think it  is  important.  So  Iwanted  to  emphasize  it.  I think, as  he  did,  that  the  choice comesdown to  zero  or  50  basis points  for  the  reasons that  everybody has  nowindicated.  The  crucial  thing  for us,  one  of  the reasons  I eliminated25  basis  points,  is  that  that  is  likely to  engender  the  belief  that weare  starting up a staircase--not  just another  shoe  to drop,  but maybeImelda Marcos'  closet.  [Laughter]  By the  same  token  if we move  50basis  points,  it  is  crucial--that  is  why I come back to  a statement--not  to  engender a belief  that we are  starting up  a shorter  staircase8/16/94-34-but  one with  risers of  50  basis  points.  Like the  Chairman,  I thinkthere is  at  least  a fighting chance  that  50  basis points  would beenough.  So with such a strong statement,  I not  only support butsupport enthusiastically the  suggestion of  the  Chairman.  Without  it,I would not.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I came  in on the  fence between  "B" and  "D."  Inever did like  "C" for  the  reasons  that  you described.  I'm not  at  allconvinced that  the  100 basis  points  is  ultimately necessary.  My staffis more  convinced, I guess along with  the Board's  staff,  than  I am,and I think going 50  basis  points now with the  kind of package you  aretalking about  reduces  the probability that  ultimately we will have  togo  the  full  100  basis points.  And so  for  that reason  I support  the  50basis points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan, I came  in  favoring alternative  D coupledwith at  least  an  increase  of  50  basis points  in  the  discount rate.  SoI, too,  support what you have recommended.  Just  a couple of commentson how aggressively  to move,  though there  seems  to  be  support  for yourrecommendation:  I think that  both to  contain emerging inflationarypressures  and to demonstrate our  resolve with respect to pricestability  in the  long run,  we have to  move  aggressively now.  I shareyour concerns  about  the potential  of  "the other  shoe dropping"syndrome with respect  to  doing  only 25  basis points.  I think, aspeople have said earlier,  temporizing now  just makes  our job  tougherlater.  With respect  to  credibility, I think there  is  evidence  infinancial  markets  that we have  a ways  to  go before we really do  havecredibility with respect  to  our longer-run  inflation  intentions.With respect  to  the  statement,  the  only concern  I would raiseand hope you  take  into account  in  drafting it  is  to  make  sure youincorporate what you said  about  not  tying our hands.  We really  can'tknow today what could transpire,  and we have  to  have flexibility  toevaluate  incoming data and move  further  if  necessary.  If  financialrest  of  the year, we could set  in motion speculative  forces  thatactually accelerate  the  need  to move  again.  So  it's got  to  be donecarefully;  I trust  your  judgment on  how to  do  that, but  it  is  tricky.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.8/16/94-35-

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  There  is  not  much  I can  add  to what  I think hasbeen  a shared  sense  that  there is  some risk right now, mostly on  theup  side,  and  that we need to  deal with that  risk.  We  agree  furthertightening  is necessary.  We would go with the  50  basis points;  wewould  follow  it  up with a  discount rate  increase.  We are  getting  intothe  area  of  nuances  here.  I think our belief  on  the  nuance  side  is  alittle  closer  to Governor Blinder's  than perhaps  to  PresidentMelzer's,  that whatever  the  nuances  are  in  this  statement,  they oughtto  be  in  the  form  of  sort  of wait  and see  if  anything more  isnecessary--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  read a  suggestion that hopefullycaptures  what  is  involved here  so  that nobody  is  blindsided  on this.The potential  statement  would read:  "The Federal  Reserve will  continueto  monitor economic  and  financial  developments  to  gauge theappropriate  stance  of  policy.  But  these  actions  are expected  to besufficient  at  least  for a  time  to meet  the  objective of  sustainednoninflationary growth."  That  is  as good a crafting as  I think  can bedone  to  capture what  it  is  we  are  trying  to  do and yet  not  tie ourhands,  because  tying our hands  would be  a terrible mistake,  and Idon't  think it's  credible  in any event.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I would fully agree with  that  and I would be  infavor of  that wording.

MR. LAWARE.  I support  your recommendation, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I also  support  the package.  If  we were  todelay, I think  it  would be  a roll  of  the dice,  because  I don't  thinkthere  would be  any new information that  would be  coming  in over  thenear term  that would make a difference.  The economy  is  moving  fastenough  that  I think we  are in  "drive,"  not  "neutral,"  right now.There  is  a chance that  a 50  basis point move  could sideline us  for  awhile and  it  may in  fact be enough.  I don't  think we  know.  I thinkthat  your wording does  capture that.  There  is  a possibility of  beingsidelined, that  our  next move may be next  spring  and may even be aneasing move.  I just  don't  think we  know.

MR. STERN.  I certainly support  the  recommendation and, asseveral  people have  already commented, I think the  statement  and anyother  discussion that  occurs  in the  next weeks are very important.The  facts  of  the  matter  are  that  we don't  know what  is  going  to comedown the  road, and  if  and when we may have  to move next.  I think weought  to  make  that clear  to  the markets, and  I believe  the  statementdoes  a pretty good  job of  that--that  this  is  not  a permanent position.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  support  the  packagevery  fully.  This may well  be  all  we have to  do  in  the  adjustment  ofpolicy that  began the  fourth of  February.  We may have  to  tighten somemore  next year, but we have  seen  that  the  effect  of  monetary policysince February  4th, because  of  the  steepness  of  the yield curve, hasbeen  somewhat  greater  than  it  was  in previous  periods.  If  thatcontinues,  we could very well get  into next  year and  decide, asGovernor Phillips  has  just  suggested,  that  the next  policy move  shouldbe  an easing  of  policy.  I  think a  very  forthright  statement,  like  theone  that  you have read  to  us,  is  most  important.  A  nuance  that  I  feelabout  it  is  that  it  is  an  indication of  self  confidence  on your  partand  the  Committee's  that  such  a  statement  be made.  A  self-confidentFederal  Reserve  that  is  seen as  doing its  job well gains  the  kind ofcredibility  that makes people  think when  the next move  is  appropriatewe will  take  it,  whether  that  is  up or  down.
