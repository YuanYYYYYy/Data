For Chairman of  the  Committee  I nominate  Alan Greenspan and forVice Chairman, William J. McDonough.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you.  I move the  nominations  cease.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  You're a  little  slow but  thank you!  It's beenmoved and  seconded and the nominations have  ceased.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  nominations  have ceased and whathappens  now?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I guess we vote.  All  in  favor--do  I do  that?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  please  carry on.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  All  in  favor  say  "Aye."

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Aye.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Opposed?  Mr. Chairman,  it  unanimously passes.Congratulations  on your  election to  another  term as  Chairman  of  theFOMC,  and congratulations, Mr. Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I thank you, Governor.  It's always  awonder  how the democratic process works  in  this  organization.  I thinkwe want  to go  next  to  filling the  staff  officer positions  and I callon  our  distinguished Deputy Secretary.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.Secretary  and Economist,  Donald Kohn;Deputy Secretary, Normand Bernard;Assistant  Secretaries,  Joseph Coyne  and Gary Gillum;General Counsel,  J. Virgil  Mattingly;Deputy General Counsel,  Ernest  Patrikis;Economists, Michael  Prell  and Edwin Truman.Associate Economists  from  the Board  of Governors:David Lindsey;Larry Promisel;Charles  Siegman;Thomas  Simpson;  and2/3-4/94-2-David  Stockton.Associate Economists  from the  Federal Reserve  Banks:Jack Beebe, proposed by President  Parry;John Davis,  proposed by President Jordan;Richard Davis,  proposed by  President McDonough;Sheila Tschinkel,  proposed by President  Forrestal.That's  the  list,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Are  there  any objections  tothat  listing  of  officers?  If  not,  I will  assume  that  they have beenselected by the  Committee.Before we  go  further,  let me  just indicate  that  we have  aproblem that  emerges  as  a consequence  of  our meeting on a Thursday andFriday as  distinct  from the middle  of  the week.  I don't know what wewill  eventually decide tomorrow, but  it's  clear  that we  may decide  totake  some  action with respect  to  rates.  Should  that be  the case,  weare caught  in a position where under  our normal procedures we would begoing  into  the weekend with a very important  decision having been madeand without  public  disclosure  thereof.  So, what  I would  intend to  doat  the end  of  our  session today is  to  discuss  contingency plans  in theevent  that we  decide  tomorrow actually to move  toward tightening.  Ifthat policy issue has  to  be  resolved, we clearly have  to  do  it  in  themorning, which means we would have to  reverse  our  agenda  and  firstdiscuss  the  regular short-term policy  issues  that  we  usually discussand  leave  the  long-term  target  issues as  the  second policy item on  theagenda.  In  the  event  that we  choose to  do  nothing, all  we'll  do  iscreate a minor difference  in  the  order we usually  handle things.  ButI think it's  probably a worthwhile precaution  in the  event  that wewe  won't know for sure,  but  I think  the point at  issue here  is  that wenot be  in a position where we  are restricted  in  taking action becauseof  concerns  about  security.  So,  later  this  afternoon I would like  todiscuss a hypothetical  case  of what we might  do  even though  it  mighttake  a few minutes  to  do  so  and it  may not  prove  to be necessary.  Butit's probably a worthwhile precaution.Let's move on now to  item 2, which is  the  selection of  aFederal Reserve  Bank to  execute transactions  for  the System Opento make such  a motion.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there a second?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Similarly, we  needto  select  the Manager  for Domestic Operations  and the Manager forForeign Operations.  Our incumbents  are  of course  respectively JoanLovett and  Peter  Fisher.  I would ask whether there are any objectionsto  their  selection with the understanding  that  the  decision made bythis Committee  is  still  subject  to  agreement  of  the directors  of  theFederal  Reserve Bank of  New York.  So,  would  somebody like  to movethat?2/3-4/94

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there a  second?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.Item  4 is  the  regular review of  the  Authorization forDomestic  Open Market Operations.  That authorization has beencirculated and if  there  are no  comments,  I will  ask whether there areany objections.  Hearing none,  I assume  that  there are  no problemsthere.Next,  we have  the review  of:  (1) the  Authorization  forForeign Currency Operations;  (2) the Foreign Currency Directive,  and(3) the Procedural  Instructions with Respect to  Foreign CurrencyOperations,  including  a review of  the  "warehousing" authorityincorporated in  the Authorization and in  the  Directive.  Copies  of  allof  these have been sent  out  to  the  Committee,  and I believe that  Mr.Truman dispatched a memorandum  on  the warehousing  issue  a few daysago.  Are  there any questions  or  comments on  those particular issues?Yes?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  All  those  issues  including  the  "warehousing"?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I have  some comments  on  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sure, please go  ahead.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Warehousing  is  a loan by  the  central bank  to  theTreasury.  That  issue  is  one that's  general not  only to  this  centralbank but  to  central banks  around the world.  Central  banks around  theworld are moving toward more  arms  length dealings with Ministries  ofFinance.  Certainly, the  "accord" between  the  Federal  Reserve  and theU.S. Treasury over 40  years  ago had that  in mind.  As  I understand it,warehousing was  proposed by Secretary Bill  Simon  in a letter  toChairman Burns  about a week or  so  before the  Ford Administration  leftoffice,  and I can't  for  the life  of  me  imagine why he  did that.  Ihaven't asked him yet, but  I am going  to ask him what was he thinkingwhen he  did that.  Subsequently, in  1979,  there was  legislationproviding for temporary  lending  in effect  by the  Reserve  Banks  to  theTreasury because  of so-called  liquidity problems having  to do  withdebt  ceiling  limitations  and all  of  that.  That  authority wascontroversial  at  the  time;  it  lasted for only  two years.  It  waswarehousing continues as  a practice, or  at  least  the authority isstill  on the  books  for us  to make a loan to  the Treasury Departmentwhen it was generally agreed going back  80  years  that  that  shouldhappen only under very, very exceptional  circumstances.  I would takethe  latter  to  involve conditions warranting a full  discussion by thisCommittee.  So  I think it's not  appropriate for us  to  have a standingauthority for  a line  of  credit  for  the  Treasury to get  us  to  lend tothem up  to  $5 billion.  And I think we  should not  authorize this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I call  on Ted Truman.2/3-4/94

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  let me  deal  with the  historical  issuefirst.  The reason why Secretary Simon proposed this  arrangement in1977 was  to  establish  a mechanism  that would allow the United Statesto participate  in  the arrangementAs  I remember,  the arrangement was  in  effect  for  a periodof a year or  two.  It was  a joint  operation that  had been negotiatedby the Treasury and the Federal  Reserve.  The System was very muchinvolved, but the  Treasury was also  very much  involved and thearrangement was  linked toThe warehousing  agreement was very much  in  that context.It was very well  thought  out;  it wasn't a casual  action.  Thewarehousing facility had existed before  that  time,  but  it  had beenmore ad hoc.  It  had existed  in  similar  circumstances  in  the late1960s when  there  also was  a special arrangementThe issue  of whether warehousing is  a loan is  obviously aquestion primarily for  the  lawyers.  This  Committee  faced that  issuein  1990.  There was  one group who  felt  that  it  was a loan  and shouldbe regarded as  a loan.  The  lawyers have  informed me  that  it  shouldnot be  considered a loan.  It  is  a market  transaction  that's carriedoff  at market  rates.  Although people can disagree with  thatinterpretation, that  has been  the  interpretation  of  this  Committee todate.  That  is  a matter of public  record.  That's  the majorityinterpretation of  the Committee,  and it  hasn't been challenged by  themajority of  Congress  or even  a substantial  minority of  Congress.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  issues  or discussionrelative  to  the  three  items  I mentioned?  If  not,  let's  take a singlevote on all.  Would somebody like to  move their  approval?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All  in  favor  say  "Aye."

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Aye.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Opposed?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  No.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, the  "Ayes" have it.  The next  itemon the  agenda is  updating the Managers' titles  in  the  Committee'sRules of  Organization and other documents.  A memorandum  from Mr.Gillum was distributed a week or  so  ago.  Any questions?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.2/3-4/94 -5-

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I'm sorry, there  was a resounding silence  onthe  last  vote.  I  think  that may  reflect  the  fact--frankly, I didn'tunderstand the  issue and that's why I didn't  say anything.  I think wehad two  "Yeses" and one  "No."  While  I agree  it  passed, could we  atleast have  some  kind of  document  laying out  the  pros and cons?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Was  that  sent?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Not  the pros and  cons.  A  document  summarizingthe history was  circulated earlier.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Well,  I  suppose what I really want to hear  is--I'm asking Jerry Jordan--you  said we had a  letter outlining  whatSecretary Simon  said.  At  some point,  perhaps next year,  I'd--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sure,  certainly.  Ted, why don't youarrange  to distribute  some  information on  this?  Actually, we've beenover  this  a number  of  times  over the  years,  and it's  an  open dispute;there  has not been unanimity in  this  Committee  on this.  Jerry Jordanhas  raised  these issues  before.  Perhaps  it  would be useful  to  get aset  of  documents  that would cover  this,  and Jerry you could possiblyadd a piece  of paper  to  that package.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  we  can recirculate the documents.  Thedocumentation was  circulated to  the Committee  in  1990;  not  all  of  youwere here  then.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I was  not here  in  1990.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We'd be glad  to  recirculate  that  document  to  theCommittee,  and we will remind you  of  it  next year when the  topic  comesup.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay?  On updating  the managers'  titles,is  there  any question on  that?  Is  there  any objection to  it?  If  not,I will  assume  it's  passed.  We now move  to  our  regular pre Humphrey-Hawkins  meeting and  I will ask somebody  to move  the approval  of theminutes  of  the  Federal  Open Market  Committee meeting of  December  21.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  We'll now move  toPeter Fisher on  foreign  currency  operations.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do we have  to authorize  the oralintervention?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Peter?  If  not,  let's moveon  to Joan Lovett  and  the Domestic  Desk.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions?  President  Forrestal.2/3-4/94well?

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Joan, do you have an  "add need" tomorrow as

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  For  the  entire period that  begins  today--whichis  the first  day of  the maintenance period--both  the New York andBoard staffs  estimate  a need to  add something  under  $1 billion  for  thefull  period.  The distribution of  those  reserves  in  the  first  coupledays of  the  period  is  such  that  today is  sort  of  straddling  "flat"  ifyou will.  Tomorrow  is  flat  to  a modest deficiency,  although  I have  tosay there's  some difference  of  opinion  about  the  estimates  of  theTreasury balance,  and that  difference  of  opinion  is  $3 billion betweenus  and  the  Treasury.  If  we  are  right,  there will be  a modestdeficiency  tomorrow;  and if  the  Treasury is  right,  there will be  amore  considerable surplus.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mr. Syron.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Joan, just  on  that  point.  This  apparently willbe  germane  to  the discussion  that  appropriately we will  be havinglater  about  how we announce  one way or  the other.  What  does  thethe need  to  stay  flat?  What  would they  think we would do  if  we werestaying neutral?

[SECTION]

MS. LOVETT.  In  the market  it  will  depend on where  thefederal  funds  rate  is.  I guess  people will assume  that  if  the  fundsrate were  firm we would signal  something  through inaction--by notproviding reserves.  However,  I  think most of  them  feel  that  ourpreference would be  to  signal  something  through  an assertive  actionand  therefore a funds  rate  anywhere  in the  range of  3 or 3-1/8  percentwould  evoke a draining action on our part.  I think  that  is  how peoplewould  see something  like  that  conveyed.  We are  coming  off a periodwhere  there has  been some uncertainty in  the  reserve numbers.  About  aweek  or  two  ago,  the market might even  have viewed this  maintenanceperiod that  we are going  into  today as  a drain period.  But  given allthe  variabilities,  they might  see this  as  what  I would call  a modestadd.  So,  for us  to  drain reserves within the  right  federal  fundscontext would get the message  across,  presuming funds  are  trading atthe  appropriate  level  for us  to  do  that.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Would we  conclude  correctly, Joan,that  as  far  as you can  see  today, if  the Committee decided that  actionshould be  taken  tomorrow, the  technical  condition of  the market  issuch  that  it would not  create  a problem  for us?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  I  think that's  correct as  far as  the technicalcondition of  the  money market  in  terms  of  getting the  rightconstellation  of rates.  Yes,  I think that's  correct.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other  questions?  If  not, would somebodylike  to  move  to  ratify the  actions  taken by the Domestic Desk?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Second.2/3-4/94

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  I think we can nowmove on  to  the  Chart  Show and Messrs.  Prell  and Hooper.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Peter and I will  bereferring  to  the  chart package  that's  been placed in  front  of  you.[Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I want  to  note  that  revisions,  if  any,on  the  forecasts  that  everyone  submitted should be  sent  to Mike  Prellby the  close  of  business next  Friday, February  11.  Questions?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I have two  questions.  The  first has  to  do withpersonal  income numbers.  Do you have  a breakdown  for personal  income,a forecast by source  of  income?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes.  I wouldn't want  to  put  too  fine  a point onany of  the numbers, but  we do  go  through a reasonably detailedexercise.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Could I get  a copy of  that  breakdown?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  You're  trying  to  get  inside  the  factory here.  Icertainly will  share with you our  major numbers.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Horrors!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  is  known as  the  statistical  sausagefactory!

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I think  one has  to  recognize  that,  when we getdown  to  these  levels  of  detail,  there  are potentially a whole  lot ofoffsetting  factors  and we don't necessarily have  strong convictions.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I realize  that you need more details  to  developforecasts.  I'm not going to hold you ex post  to  the  forecast,  believeme, but  I do  want to  have  some  sense particularly about whether thefunctional distribution  of  income  is  going to  change  from  1993  in yourforecast.  And that's  why I'd  appreciate more  details.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Interest and dividends versus wages  andsalaries?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Yes,  and  small  business  income.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I can share with the entire Committee  in broadterms  our expectations  in  this  regard.  In personal  income growth, wehave a substantial step-up  in  regular salary disbursements.  Nonfarmproprietors'  income is  expected to  rise  somewhat more than  in  1993,but  it's not  a dramatic  change.  Wage  and salary disbursements  aremuddled by all  that  income  shifted  into  1992  out of  the  first quarterof  1993.  I would caution  everyone that our  expectation  is  that  onceagain sometime during  this  year there will be  a revision of  thefourth-quarter  income  figures  that  will  show at  least some  shiftingfrom the  first quarter.  Otherwise, we have  a significant pickup  individend income.  We've  already seen  some upward movement in  thatcategory in  recent quarters;  in  fact,  quite rapid in  recent quarters.2/3-4/94-8-Also, we  have an acceleration in personal  interest  income.  Again, weare  beginning to  see,  as  the  rates have bottomed  out,  some  firming  inthat  category.  Otherwise,  transfer payments  will  increase pretty muchthe  same  as  last year.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  What  you've  told me  is  that  everything is  goingup.  I believe  that  is  true.  I would just  appreciate  seeing  the  dataexpressed as  relative  increases  at  some point.My other  question was  on housing.  I had a consumer groupallege that  a  third of  all  new single-family housing starts  aremanufactured homes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Beats me.  I just  don't know.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Are trailers part of  that?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  That's  not  in manufactured homes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's  not mobile homes;  this  is housingthat  is prefabricated  at  the  factory.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Prefabricated?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  a  lot  of  that  type  of  constructiongoes  on;  I don't  know what  the number  is.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  They may be including prefabs  plus mobile homes,in which case--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  I think usually when they talk  aboutmanufactured homes  they talk about  the  fact  that they build thevarious  structures  in a  factory and bring them on  site  for assembly.The  trouble with the  concept  is  that  it  varies  in  so many differentinstances  as  to what  degree  of prefabrication goes  on.

[SECTION]

MR.  SYRON.  This prefabrication  total  has  to be  awfully high.You  see these  structures  coming  in  on  the  trucks--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  it's  a  third,  it  has  to  be  far more--

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  That  seems  high.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  if  they were  including mobile  homes,  thenthat might be  a quite  plausible number.  Mobile homes  run a  quarter ofa million a year,  so  if  you  tacked on  100,000  or  200,000  houses  asprefabs  or whatever, that  third would be easily attainable.  I justdon't know.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You are  quite right.  It  is  attainableif  they include mobile  homes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I'll  try  to  get more precise data.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  The  other  question  I had was  on the  homeowner-ship rate.  If  you  take  out  seniors,  the homeownership  rate  declinesmore precipitously  than it  does here.  But  suppose you also  took outtwo-adult households?  You mentioned the role  of demographics  in here.2/3-4/94Knowing  the home maintenance  that's  involved, I couldn't  imagine doingit  by myself.  I wonder if  that  adjustment would  change yourconclusions about  a rebound  in homeownership?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  I've never  seen figures  broken out  thatway.  I've  seen  it by age  groups.  Are  you suggesting  that  there  is  afinancial impediment  to--

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It's  more  a  time  impediment  or  a hassleimpediment.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  No,  I don't have any real  insight.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Do you know if  data exist?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I've  not  seen them, but  there  are  lots  of  data  inthis  area;  perhaps  they have them at  the  Bureau of  the Census.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I call  the phrase  "two-adult"  households  asopposed to  "single-adult" households--homeownership  by two-adulthouseholds.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There may be  information  in the  housingcensus  on  those  owning their homes.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  In the  housing census,  okay.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  I suspect  that  somehow  there's  a cellburied in  the data that  could address--

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  There  is  a cell  in  the  sample.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  estimate are you  using internallyfor  the January CPI  change?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think we have  about  .3 percent  for January.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And the  core?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  It's  .4 percent  for  the  total  CPI.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  And  .3 percent  for  the core.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's  .4 for the total  and  .3 for  thecore?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes.  Again,  there's  some uncertainty relating  tothe  seasonal  adjustment  factors.  The  latest  word we  received just  aday or  two ago is  rather  encouraging on  how aggressive  they may be  insolving  this  problem.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  seemed  to  be the  case about  10  daysago.2/3-4/94-10-

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well, we  thought  they were going  to  go  a longway.  They may go even  further, so  that  the  seasonal  adjustmentproblem will be  largely eradicated.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  You were talking  about  the  influence of  thelength  of  the workweek on  the  growth  in  employment.  I have  arecollection that when I read Part  II  of  the Greenbook, it  said thatthe workweek  in manufacturing had reached a post-World-War-II  high  of41.7  hours.  Is  it  conceivable  that  the  length of  the  workweek mayactually fall--so  that we might  get  an  even stronger rate  ofemployment growth?  It  seems  as  though  as an extreme point  we mightjust envision that employers,  though  they have been very reluctant  tohire workers, may do  so  if  they believe  that  economic growth  is  goingto continue,  and they may actually try to  shorten the  workweek.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  thought  that  a couple  of  tenths  ago!  Thetendency has been remarkable here.  I guess  the  conventional wisdommight be that  at  some point workers  get  tired of  putting in  that muchovertime on  a persisting basis.  They  like  it  for  a while becausetheir paychecks  are padded, which makes  up  for  the  lean  times.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  It's  rather  impressive when  the length  of  theworkweek is  at a postwar peak.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The incentives  at  this  point  look  very strong  foran employer.  The  additional worker means a batch of  fixed-cost  fringebenefits plus  the perceived costs  of  hiring and possibly  firing,including  legal  expenses.  Then on  top  of  that  they  fear  that  somemedical  insurance costs might be imposed  that  they don't  face now.Our expectation  is  that  the workweek  is  probably going to  remain  quitehigh.  But  there's certainly a risk  that  it  will  shift  back some  andthat we will  see more  of  a slant toward employment  growth.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Syron.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Mike,  just  two  technical questions.  On  thiselusive business of potential,  there's  obviously no  clear answer, butdo you have  any  feel  for where  the  likelihood of  an error  is  on thepotential?  We  are getting  to  really  fine points here, but  if  you weregoing to  guess,  is  the risk  that your point  estimate on potential  istoo pessimistic  or  too optimistic?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't  see a very  obvious asymmetry in  therisks.  I might note  that  the CBO, using different  techniques  to  somedegree, arrived at  the same  numerical  conclusion as  our pointestimate--2.4 percent.  I think in  the  Bluebook there was,  as  Irecall,  some  reference  to possible risks  that  one could perceive.  Onepossibility on  the positive  side  is  that  the productivity trend  iseven  stronger than we've anticipated, but offsetting that  is  thelanguishing labor  force participation.  As  I noted, whether we'regoing  to  get  even the modest  growth  in  the  labor  force  that we'veanticipated is  a question mark.  So,  I can point  to risks  on bothsides and I think we  feel  comfortable  that  this  is  a workable basisfor  forecasting  over the  intermediate  term.2/3-4/94-11-

MR. SYRON.  I know you said that  when one  tries  to  explainprice performance, one  can do  it with  the  traditional model prettymuch without  taking  the external  sector  into account  in  a differentway than  it  has traditionally  been done  through  the import  and exportchannels.  So, you don't  think there's  very much  to this  issue ofwhether  there  is  excess  capacity overseas?  Your view is  that  capacityutilization numbers broadly can be looked  at  now  in the  same  way asthey could be  looked at before?

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  With a proviso  that  as  the  economy has  becomemore  open, these normal  channels that  are put  in  the  model  become moreimportant.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  Certainly, import prices have  a greater  effectas  the  share of  imports  has  grown over  time.  I think  the  share hascome  close  to  doubling over the  last  25  years.  But  in  addition to  theeffects  of  import prices  on  aggregate demand,  there's really  not muchcomparative  evidence although we've really only begun  to  lookcarefully at  the  statistical evidence  there.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  President  Syron,  I want  to  turn this  aroundslightly and emphasize  that we  see significant  external  impacts  on thedomestic  inflation.  Our  econometric models  do  incorporate  importprices  through the  aggregate  demand channel.  Weak economies abroadmean demand for  our  exports  is  weak.  Other things  equal,  that  tendsto  damp activity and inflation here.  So  we think  they're veryimportant  channels,  as  Peter was  emphasizing.  If  you look  at  thosetwo  factors,  that pretty much captures  it  as  best we  can judge.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Well,  that's  right.  You are  capturing  theexternal  capacity utilization  effect through  those  channels.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  But  I was  just wondering whether  independent  ofthat--thank  you.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mike,  on  the unemployment  rate, the new and theold series,  am I correct  that our  rule  of  thumb is  that  the  new willrun about  1/2  percentage point  higher?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well, two  things are  going to  happen withtomorrow's  numbers.  One  is  the  introduction of  the new survey ofhouseholds.  Looking at  the  sample  that  they used and  comparing it  tothe  official unemployment  rate,  the experience of  the past year wouldsuggest that  it was  almost  .5 different.  On  top of  that,  theseadjustments  to the  census  introduce  enlargements  in  the  labor  forceand unemployment that  add almost  a tenth to  the unemployment rate.So,  between  the two  of  them  the difference  is  somewhere  between  .5 and.6.  For  the purpose of  our  solicitation  of your  forecasts, wesuggested a number  that was  rounded  to  .6.  But  this  is,  as  I said, avery uncertain matter.  When they move to  the  full-size survey andthere's more  experience, we may find that  the  implicit  differential2/3-4/94-12-we  have that  nailed down after  the  fact  because  they won't  becontinuing a  large parallel  survey against  the old questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I want  to  get  some  guidance  on how to  interpretthe  last  table.  You made assumptions  about policy without  anyindication of  the appropriateness  of  that  policy.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Except  that  we  try  to be  sensitive  to  theobjectives  of  the  Committee, and  so we  are swayed.  The reason  that  weput  the  interest  rate  increase in,  as  I noted, was  that  we  thoughtthat  at  a minimum you  folks  had expressed  a view that  the  inflationtrend  should be pointed down;  we  just  have  it  pointed barely down.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay, well  that's  helpful.  For  '94  for  instancecompared to  '93--from the  very preliminary numbers we  have for  '93--you have nominal GDP  increasing a little  faster, actually a lot,  butthe  CPI  a little  faster.  Based on your  chart on page  8, I understandyour core rate of  inflation  for  '94  would be  slightly below this  3.3percent  that you have  in here  and  then  for  '95  you have a decelerationof  nominal GDP,  real  output,  and the CPI--again with  the core  ratebeing slightly below.  Our objective  for  each year's  inflation  is  tobe below the previous  year.  Of  course,  in  the  last  two years ex-foodand energy  the  rate  has been above  that  for the previous year;  you'vegot  it  slightly above,  so we're  back to  the  3.1  percent.  Then when  Ilook  at  the  submissions  from  the Committee members,  I'm puzzledbecause  in  the memo we got  from Gary Gillum our  instructions were  thatthe projections  for  1994  and 1995  should be based  on  the assumption  ofwhat in  our judgment would be  an  appropriate monetary policy.  Then  Isee projections  of nominal GDP  this  year with a range  up  to  7-1/2percent,  a CPI  up to  4 percent,  and nominal GDP  for  1995  with a rangeup to  6-3/4  and the  CPI  up  to  4-1/2  percent. I have  to  interpret  thatas  being a submission based on  somebody's assumption  of what  anappropriate monetary policy would produce.  Is  that yourinterpretation?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  That  was  the  instruction that went  out  to  theCommittee members,  and I thought  I would not  try to  read the minds  ofthe  Committee.  But  let me just  say--

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  But you said you did read the minds--

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Well, one  possibility I can imagine  is  thatCommittee members may feel  that  there will be  developments  in  food orenergy prices  that may obscure  an underlying trend and that  theunderlying  trend is  better than these numbers  may suggest.  But  Idon't know, and I didn't  interrogate  each person to  find out  exactlywhat his  or her objective  function is  and what  special  factors mayhave played a role  in  these numbers.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr. Chairman  and President  Jordan,  I'll  beaddressing  this  issue  a little bit  in my own briefing when we  talkabout whether  the  1995  forecasts  should be submitted  to  the Congressat  this  time.  I think your point,  President Jordan, is  well  taken  inthe sense  that  there would be  a temptation to  interpret  the  1995results  as what the Committee members  on  average desire  to happen.Although the  lags  of  policy are  long, one assumes  that  they're not  so2/3-4/94-13-long  that  you  couldn't  take  some  actions  in  early 1994  that would moveyou  a good ways  toward where you wanted to  be in  1995--given theconstraints  of  where you are  starting and the  underlying structure  ofthe  economy, which give you  sort  of  a policy  frontier as  to  the bestyou  can do.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  didn't look  at  these  numbers before wecompleted our  forecast;  in  fact,  we didn't have many of  them before wecompleted the  forecast.  When  I looked at  them a day or  so  ago,  I saidour  assumption that  the Committee might  consider a baseline with justa slight down  tilt  in  the  inflation  rate relevant  to  their discussiondidn't  seem to  run head on  into  the  forecasts  you  submitted.  So,  Ifelt  more comforted  than anything else by  this  in  terms  of  whether wewere  presenting to  you a forecast  that was generally in  the ballparkyou were  thinking about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Normally  in an economic  expansion,  developmentsin  the  real  sector are  mirrored at  least  to  some  extent  in thefinancial  side.  And this  report  is  relatively thin on  the  financialside.  Yet, we  tend  to  explain  rising  interest  rates  in  an  expansionby rising demand  for credit,  loan demand, and that  sort  of  thing.  Isthe  lack of very much on  the  financial  side  simply a continuation ofall  the dislocations and distortions  that we  find there,  or is  thisgoing to be  an expansion without very much of  an  increase  incommercial  loan demand, or what is  the  complication?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  our  expectation is  that as  the  financinggap  of  the nonfinancial  corporate  sector widens,  as  I indicated,  therewill  be  an  increased need for  credit by business  firms and aconsiderable  segment of  that will be  satisfied  in  the  shorter-termincrease in bank credit.  You  have  a flow of  funds  forecast  thatportrays  these  flows.  In  the  household sector we're anticipating,  asI said, that  the  growth in  borrowing will  exceed the growth  in  income.We  are anticipating  that  consumer credit will  continue to  grow  fairlyrapidly in  the near  term, but  that  it will  trail  off  a bit  as  theintensity of  demand for durables  wanes.  Mortgage credit will  continueto  grow apace,  in line with  our forecast  of  residential constructionactivity.  Otherwise,  we have  the  Federal government's borrowingrequirements  tailing off with the deficit,  and State  and localgovernments continue  to  borrow significant amounts  of  funds  to supportthe  investment  that I referred to.  So,  overall,  we have  debt growthrunning pretty much in line with nominal  income.We don't see  great  strains  developing over  the next  two yearsin  this  scenario.  We do  see  real  interest rates  increasing  slightly,but  at  the  long end we have nominal rates  coming down a little in  thenear  term and then backing up  slightly and  in general remaining  closeto  their recent  levels.  This  is  a rather mild experience compared toprior cycles.  Maybe that calls  into question whether we've  got  thisright,  but we do  see  fiscal policy  in an unusual  contractionary mode.That's  one  factor here, and  it will be a while before the  externalsector  is  exerting a lot  of  positive  force on  the  economy.  And withthe pent-up  demands probably relatively limited coming out  of  a mildrecession, we  think we'll work our way through  those pretty rapidly;we've  already gotten  to  a period of  high-level housing activity.  We2/3-4/94-14-don't  think we're going to  have to  see  sizable  increases  in  interestrates  in  order to  keep the  economy  on  a growth path that  is  consistentwith some  slight  downward pressure  on inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Well,  I was  going  to  include  it  as  part  of  mybriefing and  it's  up to you  after  that!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The answer  to  your question  is  that wehave not been required to do  that.  But  the  issue,  as  Don may haveindicated, is  largely an endeavor  to  respond  to  the  Senate  BankingCommittee's  question  of whether  the M2  targets  are  ceasing to beuseful.  If  they are,  the Banking  Committee  is  looking  for  a vehiclewhich would enable  them to  make  judgments  about  what  it  is  we  aredoing,  which  is  an appropriate question  on  their  part.  One  endeavorto  respond to  that  is  to  go  out  another year  in our  forecasts;  that'sthe main  reason that's  in here  for Committee consideration.  This  has,however, been put  together tentatively pending  the discussion by  theCommittee  of  whether we want  to  do  this.  But  should the  Committeetrouble.2/3-4/94-15-

MR. PRELL.  I think  simply having the  numbers may give  someadditional  context  to  the discussion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions  for  the gentlemen?If  not,  would somebody like to  start  our roundtable?  President Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Mr. Chairman, with regard  to  the  nationaleconomy, in  terms  of  growth at  least  for  this  year  our forecast  isreally very close  to  the  staff  forecast,  especially  for the mainsectors  involved, and any difference is  really not worth talkingabout.  Our overall  CPI  forecast  is  a little  lower  than the  Boardstaff's;  part  of  that  I think is  due  to  seasonal  adjustment  factors.Offsetting this,  our core  rate  of  inflation is  just  a little higherthan  the  staff  forecast,  so  there  is  a little difference  in  ourexpectations with regard to  energy prices.With regard to  the District,  the  level  of activity  and Ithink  the general  tone  of  things  and the underlying  strengths  arebetter now than they were at  the  time of  the  last meeting.  Anddespite  the  really miserable weather  that  we've been having  in  theMidwest, so  far  I don't  sense  any dropoff  in  the level  of  underlyingactivity  this year of  the  magnitude  that we  had last year.Admittedly, it's  early  to be  coming  to  this  conclusion, but  certainlyin  the Midwest we've not had the  same kind of  dropoff.The auto  business,  of  course,  continues  to  lead the way.Production schedules  for  the  first quarter--it's  hard to believe  thesenumbers--have been set  some  15  percent  higher  than  the  levels  of  lastyear or little more  than  that,  and of  course last  year was  a strongcomparative period.  So  the  first-quarter production  is  going to  bevery, very heavy.  And  in fact  for  some models, manufacturers  are nowexperiencing some  capacity constraints.The  outlook for  the  heavy truck  business has  been  improving.Producers are  raising their  forecasts  some  5 to  10  percent above  lastyear's  sales  and production levels,  and again  last year was  a prettygood year.  And related to  this,  the  truck-trailer business  isreported by one  company to  be  absolutely on  fire.  The  shortage  oftruck  shipping capacity is now a decided problem.  Shippers  havebecome  concerned and are pushing  the  large  companies  to add  to  theirequipment and also  to hire more  drivers.Despite the  adverse  growing conditions  last year  in the  agsector,  farm  incomes were good.  Certainly  farm attitudes  coming intothe new year are positive, and this  is reflected in  continued strengthin  the production and sales  of  ag  equipment.  The production schedulesfor one  large manufacturer have been raised  some  16  percent abovetheir earlier expectations  for  this year.Retail  sales  are  surprisingly strong.  Christmas,  of course,was  just  terrific.  Sales  limitations, at  least  for  some stores,resulted from  the  inability of  suppliers  to deliver and not  fromresistance from customers.  Again, despite  the miserable weather, wereally have not  seen  as  adverse an effect  on  retail sales  as  we mighthave  expected.  And  to  state  the  obvious,  sales  of  snow shovels  andbatteries have been phenomenal!2/3-4/94-16-In  talks with representatives  of  various  companies,  I thoughtI'd mention three differences from what I noted the  last  time.  First,despite  higher  sales  levels--and  I think Mike  Prell had a chart  thatdemonstrates  this--inventories  remain under very, very tight  control.One  large manufacturer  reported that  this  is  the  first time  in  thehistory of  their company that  they've  had a significant  increase inproduction  and sales  and yet have not  had an  increase  in  inventories.They are  obviously managing their  inventories  very carefully.  Butthey  are managing them on  an absolute  basis and not  on a relativebasis.  Second, while the now almost macho  "I'm not hiring  any moreemployees"  statements continue to prevail,  this  time  there were  twoheavy manufacturers who  said they are adding employees and this  is  asharp  shift  from their earlier  "not ever"  statements.  Third,  I'msensing  some price pressures out  there,  and I think it's  more now thanjust  steel.  Several  contacts reported that  the prices  for theirpurchased products are  edging up  just  a little.  Also,  in  terms oftheir prices,  though marketplace pressures remain competitive,  theysaid they have  been able to  raise  some prices  and those  increases  aresticking.  That  is  by no means prevalent  nor are the  increases  large,but  at  the margin a subtle change  seems  to be  occurring.  So,  I thinkthe  outlook here  is  a little different  than  it has been.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, while economic  activity is  healthyin most of  the Twelfth District, weakness  in California persists.Payroll  employment, usually what we  consider to  be  the most  reliableshort-term  indicator of  economic  activity for  a state,  continues  tothe  California economy is  finally bottoming out.  Following earlierlosses,  real  retail  sales have  stabilized during the  past year or  soand construction  employment  seems  to  have bottomed out as well.  We'realso  starting  to see  some  encouraging signs  in  the housing  sector,although it's  still  too early in our  view to  tell whether this  is  thebeginning of  a true housing recovery.  For example,  the number  of homesales  has  been rising for  the past  several  months and there  was  asurge  in  sales  in the  month of  December.  The number  of  home permitsalso has risen  in the  last  two months,  although it  is  still  very lowby historical  standards.  However, when we  looked at what  otherforecasters  are  saying about  the  California economy, no one  expectsany significant  improvement during the near term.  Most  forecastersexpect  the  California economy to be  flat  during the  first half  of  thisyear with only very minimal growth during the  second half  of  the year.Preliminary damage estimates  from  the earthquake put  theproperty losses at  $15  to  $30  billion, depending  on who  is  making theestimates.  This  makes  it  one of  the worst  U.S. natural  disasters onrecord.  Still,  the quake probably will  not change  significantly theoverall pace  of  economic  activity in the  Los Angeles area.  In  the  SanFrancisco area  after the Loma Prieta  Earthquake,  earthquake-relatedreductions  in business activity were  largely offset  by demolition,construction, and engineering activity associated with rebuilding.President  Clinton has  asked Congress  to  authorize  $9.5  billion  forearthquake relief and the  California  government ultimately willcontribute to  the  rebuilding efforts  as well.  It's  a little  difficultto estimate how much money will  be  coming  from the  state, but  theexperience we  had with the  7.1 Loma Prieta  earthquake  in  1989  suggeststhat  it will  cost  the  state between  $1 and  $2 billion.2/3-4/94-17-If  I can now turn  to  the national  economy, the strong growthin  the second half  of  last  year certainly, as  we  all know, hasnarrowed the  gap between actual  and potential  GDP and has broughtunemployment down close  to most  estimates  of  the natural  rate.  We'rebasically in  agreement  with the Greenbook  forecast for  real GDP growthin  the neighborhood of 3 percent  for  1994  which, of  course, wouldnarrow the  gap  further.  I was  struck when Mike  Prell  referred to  thestubbornness  of  wage  inflation in  Chart 8.  Growth  in  the  employmentcost  index  as  was  indicated by that  chart  has  been stuck at  3-1/2percent  for  quite a while.  At  current  interest rates,  it  seems  asthough we  would not  be  able  to  expect any  further progress  in bringinginflation down  in 1994  and clearly not in  1995.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Little has  changed  in  the Eleventh Districteconomy since our  last meeting.  Growth remains  in  the range  ofmoderate  to  strong and employment growth  is  strongest  in  theconstruction and durable manufacturing sectors.  For context,  jobgrowth has  been positive for  the  last  11  quarters and  for  26  of  thepast 27  quarters.  To  echo  Si  a little bit, we  do  have some  reports  oflabor shortages, particularly in  the  trucking  industries  and in  someconstruction trades.  There is  also  some  evidence of  upward pressureon construction prices, but  the  low  level  of  interest rates  seems  tohave offset  that in  keeping housing affordable  and  fostering robusthousing performance  in  the  District.Regarding the  national  economy, we're very close  to  theGreenbook projections;  we're just  a little  stronger on real  growth,  Ibelieve, but  less  on  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Syron.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, conditions  arelegitimately better  in our District.  The region's economy  showsgenuine  improvement;  I think  it's  cumulating.  The only  state  that'san  exception  to  that  is Connecticut.  Manufacturing--particularly indurables, products that are  tied to  autos and capital goods--lookspretty strong.  Exports  are  still  soft,  however,  and medical  equipmentis  one area where you might expect  this.  Producers  of medicalequipment  indicate  that  low ticket  items  are  still  doing all  right,but  that  MRI machine  orders,  for  example, are  off about a third, whichagain  it  follows the  national pattern with autos  and high-tech goodsbeing better  and some  retailers  in  soft  goods  feeling  that things  arerelatively weak.  The residential  real  estate  market is,  I would say,very strong.  In fact,  realtors tell  us  that  in  certain pricecategories  in  the  low end of  the  market  inventories  are  getting quitethin now.  For New England, given the  time  of  year, there's  a lot  ofconstruction activity going on  that hasn't been  reflected  in pricesvery much yet.  But we will have  tight  labor  conditions  in  thebuilding trades this  spring, particularly since  there are  so manyroofs to  be replaced, ceilings  to be put back in,  and other repairsmade necessary as  a result  of  the  cold weather.  Other  than that,there is  some  improvement in  employment.  Prices  generally  are wellbehaved except for  items that  Si  mentioned--shovels and salt,  whereprices can  be over  $1 a pound for salt.2/3-4/94-18-As  far  as  the U.S. economy goes,  we  tend to  agree  quite  a  lotwith the  Greenbook, but  I  must  say we're  somewhat more optimisticabout  this  1994-1995  period.  We  expect  output  to be  somewhat  strongerin  1994,  though not  enormously  so,  which  is  also  reflected in  somegreater attenuation  in  the  unemployment  rate.  We  also are  slightlymore  optimistic  on prices, but  that  is  because  at  least  in  the  shortrun  I  think we're more  optimistic  on potential.  Well,  that's  where weare.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  The  tone  in  the District  is  positive, and Iwould  say  tentatively optimistic,  going  out  for  the  balance  of  theyear.  Except  for  commercial  real  estate,  most  sectors  and  areas  ofthe District  are  growing, and  the  growth appears  to  be  self-feeding,although  the  District  is  still  growing more  slowly than  the  nation  asa  whole.  One  of  the  indicators  I  use  is  how vociferously businesspeople  complain.  I  was visiting with a  group of  20  or 25  businesspeople  in  central  Pennsylvania  a  couple  of weeks  ago and didn't  hearany complaints.  It  was hard to  keep  them  focused on  talking about  theeconomy.  There  is  a  sense  that  an  increase  in  interest rates  isalmost  a  foregone  conclusion, all  of  which  I  interpret  to  mean  thatthings  are  going well  and  they just  don't want  to  talk about  it  verymuch.  It's  that  Pennsylvania  Dutch reticence,  I  think, on  their part.There  still  is  a  reluctance to  hire, but  hiring is  going onnonetheless  in many parts of  the  District.  I,  too,  have picked  up  ahint  of  perhaps  a  little more  in  the way of  price increases--particularly in prices  paid by business  firms.  It's  not  a  lot,  butthere  wasn't much of  a  hint  a  few months  ago.As  for  the  nation as  a  whole, I  think the  momentum of  lastyear has  spilled  over.  I  don't  think the  type  of  slowdown we  saw ayear ago  is  very likely.  The  3  percent  growth  rate or  thereaboutsseems  about  right.  My  sense  is  that  if  there  is  any asymmetry interms  of  the  risks  to  the  forecast,  it  is  probably  that  the  economyreal  quarrel with  the  rest of  the  staff's  forecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Well,  the moderate  expansion that we've  beenexperiencing  appears  to be  continuing  in  our District.  Looking atsome  of  the  sectors,  retail  sales  have been quite good  since Christmaswith the  exception of  apparel  and particularly women's  apparel  thatrequired a  lot  of  heavy discounting over  the  holidays.  Retailers aregenerally keeping  their  inventories  quite  lean;  they are waiting forindications  of  continued consumer  interest  before  they build up  theirspring inventory  lines.  If  sales  don't  taper  off,  many of  them aregoing  to  find themselves with  stocks  that  are  actually  too  low.Tourism is  fairly healthy around  the  District with theexception of  Miami,  which is  still  suffering  from bad publicity.  Inproduction,  our  latest  survey would indicate  that  compared to  lastmonth  things  are  looking quite good  currently as  are  expectations  forsix months  from now;  that's with respect  to production, volume  ofshipments,  volume  of  orders,  and  the  backlog of  orders.  In  the  miningsector,  the  rig  count  is  up to  119;  that's  up two  dozen  from a  yearago  and that's  almost  exclusively  in the  natural  gas  area.2/3-4/94-19-In  the  real  estate  area,  residential  construction is  quitestrong.  Reports  of possible overbuilding have  completely vanished,lumber prices  are now adjusted  for  in many construction  contracts, andsub-contractors  are  still  in  short  supply.  Multifamily housing  isalso  improving and occupancy rates  are  edging  somewhat  higher.  Butnew development  is  practically nonexistent  at  this point.  On  thecommercial  side,  I think we've probably hit  the bottom and vacancyrates  are beginning to  fall  a little.  But,  again, new development  isalmost  always build-to-suit with no  speculative development  apparentat  all.On  the  employment side,  the  Sixth District widened slightlyits  lead  in  employment  growth over  the nation  in  the  fourth quarterwith strength in construction, services,  trade,  and government.  Joblosses  in manufacturing have  stopped almost  completely and some  gainsare  evident, particularly on  the durables  side.  I might mention portactivity;  it's  apparent at  least  in New Orleans  and perhaps  in  some ofthe  other ports  around  the District  that  NAFTA is  beginning  to  have  apositive effect  already.On the  price  side, for  the  first  time  in  a long  time  ourdirectors have  talked a little  about  seeing some price  increases.This  was  basically in  concrete  and lumber,  so  it's  evident at  thispoint only  in housing and construction more generally.  Where  there isimport  competition, prices  seem to be  feeling  no pressure.  But  Ithought  it  was  interesting that we got  those  reports  for  the  firsttime  in many, many months.  I would say  that  the  sentiment  in theDistrict  is  really quite  good and what's  interesting  to  me  is  thatthere no longer is  this  expectation that  growth will be  very robust.There  is  now a recognition that  growth is  going to be  more moderateand perhaps more  stable  over the period.With respect  to  the national  economy, we don't really haveany  differences with the  Greenbook  forecast.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, our  District continues  to  grow ata very steady pace  on  the whole.  Within  the District,  though--as  Imentioned I think  in November and I'll  say it  again  today--there  is  alittle more  of  a boom-like atmosphere  in  the western and  the northernportions.  There  is  very strong housing  and a shortage of  labor  inthat  industry.  Manufacturing is  doing better, especially  in thenondurable goods  area.  The slow areas  are  energy, except  for naturalgas, which  of course  is  a little more  on a roll  right now.  Also, wethink we will  have modest  activity in  the  agricultural sector becauseof  the  floods and the effects  from  that.At the  national  level,  our view is  that  inflation may run  alittle  higher than  in the Greenbook  forecast  for a couple  of  reasons.Our GDP projection  is  a little  stronger  than  the Greenbook's,especially in the  second half of  the  year.  But also we have estimateda little  lower unemployment  rate and we have  a little higher,  I guess,natural  rate  of  unemployment  in  our  thinking than the  Greenbook  andthat  is generating added price pressures  as we  see  it  in  ourprojections.  I would add to  that  on the  other  side a point  that maybe  of  interest  in  terms of  the  amount of  liquidity that  is  in  thesystem.  In talking  with some  fund managers,  it  seems  to  us  that an2/3-4/94-20-attitude  is  developing--almost a bandwagon effect--in terms  of  theflows  of  some  of  these  funds  into  investment opportunities  they areseeing.  We  are  hearing a lot  of  this  going on--emerging markets andthose sorts  of  things--from these  fund managers,  and we  take note  ofthat.  I think it  is  having  some  impact  on attitudes  in  the economy.That,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  how it  looks.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr.  Chairman, at  the  last  meeting  I talked alittle about  the  differences between the  rich  and  the poor,  and  Ifocused primarily  on how  taxes would affect  the  rich  and how thatmight  affect our  forecast.  I got  some  compliments,  so  at  the  risk ofdiscouraging all  praise,  I thought  I'd  try it  again and this  timefocus  on  the  other  end of  the  spectrum--the bottom 99  percent  of whichI am clearly a part.  The  thesis here  is  that  demographicallydifferent people  have  different  tolerances  for borrowing.  The  twogroups  that  I have  separated out  were  individuals over  65,  who  areunlikely  to  incur  additional  debt  for  life-cycle reasons,  and  those  inthe  top  1 percent  in  terms  of  income,  which is  roughly people  makingover  about $225,000.  I would imagine  that debt may be  a conveniencefor  them but it  is  not  subject  to  their  economics.  The  data  that  Ihave  come  from  a number of  sources.  Generally,  they are  from  the  P60series  the  Labor Department  puts  out  and also  some  tax  data.The first  chart  in my handout, which  I think was  distributed,shows  that we have  a trend  that  has  developed over  time  where theshare  of  income  going  to  the  old has risen  since  the end  of  World WarII;  it  has more  than doubled.  And  the  share  of  income going  to  thesetwo  groups,  the  old  and  the rich, has  just about  doubled.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Netted out or what?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Netted out--taking out  the  old rich.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So,  it's  the old plus  the young  rich.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It's  the  old plus  the young rich.  Actually,the way I did it  was  the rich  plus the  poor old.  [Laughter]  That'sbecause  getting  the data was  a bit  easier  that way.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Could you  call  us  the  "no longer really young"instead of  the  old?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  John, you're not  in this  group!

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  You've  got  to  get politically correct!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That's  right.  Well, we  struggled with thatlabeling.  I started with the  "middle-aged middle  class"  and  thatdidn't  sound  too  good.  So,  we ended up  calling  it  those  likely toborrow of  the non-rich, non-old.The next chart  shows  the  debt  service adjusted  for Chart  1which is  the rise  in  the income  share  of  the  old  and the rich.  Thebottom line with the  triangles  on  it  shows  the  regular  series  that  ispresented by the  staff  and  the  top line  shows  the  adjusted  series.The  adjustment  seems  to make  some difference, particularly  in  recent2/3-4/94-21-trends.  If  you  apply debt service  to  those  of  us who  actually have  toborrow, it's  quite high.  The  same  is  true  on the debt  outstandingshare,  on  the next chart,  which again assumes  that  debt  is  being borneby those who  have  to  borrow.  It's  now up  to  110 percent  of  disposableincome, whereas  the more  standard measure puts  it  around 75 percent.So,  I would say  that  those who  actually have  to  borrow to  expand  theirspending  are probably more  constrained  than  the  data that  we've lookedat  indicate.  I might  say  that  these  are not publication-qualityanalyses,  but what  I did  to  see  if my thesis worked was  to  tryapproaching  it  from  an entirely different  angle.  So,  rather  than useP60  data,  my next  approach was  to go  to  the NIPA data  and see  if  thatshowed  the  same  effects  based  on a functional  distribution  of  income.The  first thing  that's  important  to  realize  is  that the NIPAdata do  not mean income  earners  actually get  the  money.  I convincemyself  of  that  every year when I do my  taxes,  when  I also  compile  formy wife  a breakdown of  our  income  and where  it  was  spent.  I find  thatuseful  because  I always  tell her  we never have  any money but we end upmanaging  to spend  lots  of  it  and she never believes  me.  So  I presentthe  actual  breakdown and  she  is  forced to  concede  the  facts.  Theinteresting point  that  I want  to  make here  is  that  not  all  NIPA incomeis  actually spendable by households,  and that's particularly true withregard  to  interest  and dividends.  For  example,  the  income  thataccrued  on your 401K plan  is  counted as  interest  and dividend incometo you, but you  really can't  get  at  it.  And that  actually is  a veryimportant phenomenon  in the  economy.  So,  I broke down the NIPA incomeinto  a number of  areas.  Cash  income--excuse me  the  chart  says  "cash"but  it  should  say wages--wages  are basically  all  paid in  cash.  Onlyabout  8 percent  is  received by  the rich and 3 percent by  the non-richelderly.  So,  89  percent  is  received by those  of us  who  are  likely  toborrow.  Of  interest  income, only about  45  percent  actually finds  itsway to  the  households where  it  can be  spent.  And the way  I got  thisnumber was  to  look at  the  ratio  of  what  is  reported on  tax  returns  towhat is  reported  in NIPA.  The  tax return  data probably are  fairlyreliable  at  the moment,  since paying  institutions  are now required toput out  a  statement  for  everything over  $10.  So,  only about  45percent of  interest  in  the  economy actually  is  received by households.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Excuse me,  the  Commerce  Department doesbreak that  down into  imputed  interest and dividends--interest  imputedat random  from the cash  flows,  so  they  are using  the  same data.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  They are using the  same data,  yes.  I had  toget the  income  for  the elderly  too,  so  I had to  go back  and look  attax return data where people  used an  exemption  for  those  over 65;  thatflagged the  returns  to  be used in  the  tabulation.  It  turns  out  thatonly about  14  percent  of  total  NIPA interest  is  actually  received bypeople  likely to borrow.  The  same  is  essentially true  of  dividends--16  percent--and  of  small  business  income at  27  percent.  The  incomeretained by small businesses  includes such  things  as  inventoryappreciation, capital  consumption allowances,  what have you, whichwhile  income  really can't be  eaten or used  to pay a credit  card bill.That's  why the distinction  is  here.  The  reason  I think  that'simportant  is  that what  we're  seeing is  a big change  in the  functionaldistribution of  income  away from wages, particularly  in  the  last  twoyears.  For a  comparison period, I took  the  change  in personal  incomefrom 1983  to  1988  which was  of  course the heyday of  Reaganomics whenwe all  know workers were  being  stomped on by  the  capitalists who were2/3-4/94-22-in power!  Still,  in  spite of  that,  56  percent  of  all  the  increase  inpersonal  income was paid in  the  form of  wages.  If  you turn  to  thelast  chart,  of  the  increase in personal  income in  1992  and 1993  only47  percent was  paid in wages.  During  1993  that  fell  to  38 percent.And even  during the  fourth  quarter  of  1993,  when everyone was  sayinghow good  the economy was and optimism was  rising,  only  38.4  percent  ofthe  increase  in personal  income actually was  in  the  form of  wages.So,  the way I would talk about  the  last  three  charts  is  that  the non-rich, non-old live paycheck to paycheck, quite  literally.  That'swhere all  their  income  comes  from.  Remember, virtually none of  thecapital  income or  business income  goes  to  them.  They have  to  live  ontheir wages  and that wage  share  is  also  declining.  So,  whether youlook at  the  aggregate numbers  from NIPA or  at  the aggregate numbersfrom the  P60  series,  the middle-class, middle-aged people who  areborrowing are  really getting their  income squeezed.  What that  wouldsuggest  to me  is  that  unless  the  trends  change  and employment picksup,  the  capacity of  households  to  take  on ever more  debt  is  going tohave  to  stop at  some point, and perhaps  sooner than we  think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  My report  is  going to  be pretty bland afterthat, but  developments  since  the December meeting have  simplyreinforced my view that  the  economy  is  moving ahead nationally at  agood clip.  Also,  the  recent national  data show that the  economyfinished 1993  on a high note,  and it  seems  clearly to have  entered thecurrent  year with a lot  of momentum.In our  District our  directors and other  business contactsreport  that economic  activity is  continuing to  strengthen and improvepretty much across  the board.  There may be a little more  strength inthe  southern part  of  the District--in  the Carolinas--wheremanufacturing  is  dominant and  a little  less in  the  northern part  ofour  region where  defense and other government activity is  moredominant.  But, clearly, the District  is  in good shape  overall.  Intheir comments  at  all  three  of  our board meetings  in  January severalof  our directors  described conditions  in  their respective  local  areasas booming.  Even  the  Charleston, South  Carolina area,  for  example,which has  been hard hit by naval  cutbacks is  described as  doingreasonably well  under the  circumstances.  This  is  not  to  say thateverybody in our District is  happy about  the present and optimisticabout the  future, but  I think  it's  fairly accurate to  say that  theoverall  tone  of  the  information we're getting  is  about  as  good as  itever gets  on  average  in  this business.  The outlook and attitudestoward at  least the  near-term future  among most  of  our business peopleare pretty optimistic.  I don't  think  they are expecting  anysignificant slowing  in  activity.  The severe winter weather  in recentweeks has been disruptive,  to put  it gently, and it may havesuppressed activity a little.  But I think much of  that  loss  isexpected to be  temporary and made up  in  the months  ahead.  Also, mostpeople around here don't deal  with the  sub-zero  temperatures  verywell,  so  plumbers and body shops have been doing quite well  latelyalong with cab drivers  and electric utilities  and franchises thatdeliver pizza!As  far as  the national  situation is  concerned, the  Greenbookprojections  for  1994  certainly seem reasonable  to us,  not  that theyneed our blessing, but  they  impress us  as  fully defensible.  We  are  a2/3-4/94-23-little  stronger  on real  GDP growth  and a little  lower  on  inflation.Our projections have GDP growth at  3.2 percent  and  a CPI  of  2.9percent.  I would say  that  the  risk  of  error  on  those numbers--I'm notsure my staff  would agree with me  on this--is  probably  tilted to theup  side.I don't want  to  jump  the gun  on  the  policy discussion  again,but  I do need  to  say  just by way  of  explaining--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Wait  a second, what do you mean?[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN(?).  He  read the memo!

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Yes,  I did read  the  memo.  Just by way  ofexplaining our  projections  and  in particular  our projection  thatinflation may be  about  1/2  point  lower than  the Greenbook  isexpecting:  We base that  projection  on an  assumption  that  theCommittee will  move quite quickly to  do whatever  it  needs  to  do  tokeep actual  inflation under  control  and keep inflationary pressuresfrom rising  significantly in the months  ahead.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's pretty  good!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I ought  to  stop  there.  But  just  one  finalstatement:  I really  think the  System's  anti-inflationary  stance  hasdone a great  deal  to  increase our  credibility  in recent  years,  and interms  of  the  forecast  I think  it's  quite  likely  that  that  will  give usa better breakdown of  nominal  GDP between real  growth and  inflation  ifwe  follow through.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Business  conditions  inthe District  remain  quite  positive  and the  strength  is  widespread bothby sectors  of  the  economy and geographically.  I'm certainly hearingfewer comments  of  concern about  the  future  or  about  the  fragility ofthe current  expansion;  that  has diminished.  One  aspect  of  the  economythat  I have commented on before and  I'll  just  reiterate briefly isthat we  have  had steady employment  growth  and we have  low unemploymentrates  in most  of  the District  states now.  That  tends  not  to  beremarkable  in heavily agricultural  states,  but we  have  lowunemployment  rates  in most  of  the major metropolitan areas  as well,which I think is  a more significant way of  looking at  it.  And we  arehearing a variety of reports  of  labor shortages  now--not  at  theunskilled  end of  the  labor market, but  at  levels  above  that  clearlythere are  growing  reports  of  labor  shortages.  That does not  seem tohave  translated  into discernible wage pressures  yet.  But  that  seemsto me  almost  inevitable.  At  some  point along  the  line  here  one of  thereactions  is  going to  have  to be  some  wage pressures both  to attract,but  maybe more importantly  to retain, some  of  the workers  who are  inshort  supply.With regard to  the national  economy, in  looking at  theGreenbook and  listening to  Mike Prell's  comments,  I took  the  staffforecast  to be  a sort  of  "more of  the  same  only less  so"  forecast.What  I mean by that  is  that  the  economy grew over  the second half  ofthe  year somewhere between  4  and 4-1/2  percent  in  real  terms.  If  we2/3-4/94-24-get  away from disturbances because  of  the weather and auto  schedulesand so  on, I conclude  that we're  going  into  1994 with a good deal  ofmomentum, more momentum probably than  the Greenbook  forecast seems  toincorporate.  So  I feel pretty good about the  state of  the  economy,but  that  also implies  that  at  least under current circumstances  we'renot  going to bend  inflation down further  from here.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  In  spite  of my own doubts about  the matter,  Iconsistently run into  the  expectation throughout our  District thateventually it  will  thaw out!  It's  an  the area  of  the  country wheresevere winter weather seems  to  have  absolutely no  negative  effect  onpeople's mood and outlook.We also hear  the  stories  of  shortages  of  certain  classes oflabor and the difficulty of hiring.  Some of  our major manufacturingareas  are reporting under 4 percent unemployment.  I hear  the  sameexpressions  of  reluctance  to  hire that  others  apparently still  arehearing although Ohio,  for  instance--whatever  the  credibility of  thedata--showed a 3-1/2  percent  increase in  employment  last  year.  So,they  "reluctantly" hired a lot  of people.  The  last  time  I saw boththese kinds  of  numbers  and  this  rather pervasive mood of  "everything'sokay and getting better" was when I lived in southern  Californiaduring the  roaring boom in  the  latter  1980s  before  the bust.  Si  hasalready mentioned a lot  of  the  region-specific and  the  sector-specificdevelopments  that  also  relate  to  our  area.  I'm not  going  to gothrough  those  in  detail.  One  thing that  I could add on  the motorvehicles  side, after  calling around to various  plants  in  the District,is  that  they are  estimating  that  the weather  reduced production bysome  60,000  to  70,000  vehicles  in  the  quarter and not  all  of  that willbe made up.  Industry contacts  tell  us  that  some  of  the  plants, byrunning overtime,  can make up  lost  output by the  end of  March;  othersare telling us  that  their production schedule  for  the  quarter wasalready such that  they are not going to  be  able  to make  it  up;  theyview these  as  permanent  losses  in production.  Some  of  the plants wereshut down  totally for as  much as  four  days.  All  of  the  lenders  in  theDistrict  are  talking about  very strong  credit  demands--commercial,consumer, and residential.  I haven't  heard any reference  to  thenotion  of a credit  crunch  in  some  time now.On  the  national side,  my forecast is  that  the  numbers  for  thelast two  years will  be  revised substantially and that  once we get  thatrevision  three  or  four years  from now and  look back  on the period, alot  of  these  intra-year patterns will  go  away.  A smoothing processwill  indicate  that we  didn't have a weak first  half  last year and aboom in  the second half, but more or  less  that  the  economy in the  lastcouple of  years has  grown somewhere in  the 3 to  4 percent  range, andthat won't look quite so  odd.  When I look at  year-ago  expectationsabout  1993  and then  look at  the  numbers  that we had on balance,abstracting  from the  intra-year pattern, real  output growth was aboutwhat was  expected a year ago  and the CPI  came  in about  as  wasexpected.  Yet  during the  course  of  the  year, the numbers  for  1994generally continued  to  show an upward revision for  inflation.  And nowthe numbers  for 1995--we've  only had a couple  of  forecasts  that  go  outto  1995--are  already showing higher numbers.  In  fact,  the numbers wenow have  for  1995  are  higher  than  the numbers we had for  1994  a yearago;  1993  similarly was progressively moved up.  So,  it's  a pattern2/3-4/94-25-that  implies becoming  accustomed to  accepting no  further progress  oninflation, and  I find  that  very disturbing.  If  those numbers  areaccurately based  on  current policy or  the  assumption  about what policywill be,  then  I think  the  conclusion would have  to be  one of  twothings:  Either  we have  changed our objectives with regard  toinflation or we have  to  change our policies.  Otherwise we're going  tosend the wrong message  to people  who  look at  these numbers to  gaugethe  Committee's  real  intent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Our  outlook  for real  growth next  year issomewhat more optimistic  than  that  of  the Greenbook,  but  in  the  caseof  inflation  our outlook  is  considerably more pessimistic.  Nearly allof  the macroeconomic  indicators  have become  increasingly  favorable  andpoint  to  a strong  and sustainable  expansion.  But  the  down side  ofthis,  of  course,  is  that  both capacity utilization and unemploymentare approaching  levels  that  raise  concerns  about how  long the economywill  stay in the  disinflationary mode.  In  addition, recoveries  in  theeconomies  of  U.S.  trading partners  as  indicated in  the  Chart  Show'salternative  scenario might also  generate  demand pressures  that wouldlead to  price  increases.Like  the  national  economy, our District  economy continues  toimprove  and  in  some  sense has been outperforming  the  national economy,at  least  in  terms  of  employment  growth.  Many firms  have  reportedincreases  in  sales  and  employment.  In fact,  in  at  least  two parts  ofthe District  that  I've heard about  recently, northwest Arkansas andnortheast  Mississippi,  labor  shortages have  curtailed  industrialexpansion.  District  retailers report  good-to-strong sales of  mosttypes  of  merchandise during  the holiday  and post-holiday periods.Single-family home building is  unseasonably strong  in  many parts  ofthe  District,  largely because builders are  scrambling  to  start  andfinish projects  that were  delayed in  the  latter half  of  1993  becauseof wet  weather.  After  several years  of  stagnation, multifamilyhousing  construction appears  to be  on  the upswing, as  apartmentoccupancy rates  and  rental  rates  edge up.  And as  is  the casenationally,  sales  of new and existing homes have  been relativelystrong  lately and  average  selling prices  continue  to  rise.  Inagriculture,  soybean stocks  nationally are  down 49  percent  from  lastyear and corn  stocks  are  down 62  percent.  The  stocks/use  ratios  forthese  crops are  only 7.6  percent  and 10.4 percent  respectively, whichare  the  lowest  levels we've  seen  since  the mid-1970s.  So,  clearly, inthose  areas we are  quite vulnerable  to  any kind  of  weather  shocks.One  final  comment:  Loan demand both nationally  and at  the  Districtlevel  seems  to  have  increased.  At  a number  of  our  large Districtbanks, we have reports  of  a  significant increase  in all  majorcategories  of  loans during  the  last  two months  of  the  year  relative tothe previous  two  months.Let me  just  end up with some comments  about  inflation.  Weproject  that  the  CPI  will move  up sharply in  1994  and will be evenhigher  in 1995.  Indeed,  there may be some  early warning  signs  thatthe economy's  disinflationary course  has  already come  to an  end.  Whenits  volatile food and  energy components  are  removed, the CPI  rose at  a3.4  percent  rate  during the  last  three months  of  1993,  upsignificantly  from the  2.4  percent rate  of  increase  during  theprevious  six months.  The  CRB  futures price  index  is  up by nearly 132/3-4/94-26-percent  from  its  level  a year ago  despite a very significant  declinein  energy prices.  An even sharper  increase  is  seen  in  the Board'sexperimental  commodity price  index when the  food  and crude  oilcomponents  are omitted.In  addition,  long-term interest  rates have  risen  somewhatfrom their October  1993  lows.  In  our view, measured either by thegrowth rates  of  M1  and reserves  or  the ex post  real  federal  fundsrate,  the  stance  of monetary policy has  been very expansionary  forabout  the  last  three years,  and we weigh  this  sustained stance  ofmonetary policy heavily in making  our  forecast  of  longer-run  inflationtrends.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman, my sense  of  the course  of  eventsis  in  flux.  As  far as  the  strength of  the  economy goes,  I had beenthinking up through  the  time  of  the  last  meeting that  we were indeedgoing to  have a strong  fourth  quarter but  that  we would be  looking  atsome  substantial moderation  after that.  The  fourth quarter now doesappear to  have come  in meaningfully stronger  than I had thought andthat  seems  to be  accompanied by considerably more momentum  than  I hadanticipated.  The  new data that we've  been receiving recently  lookquite strong  to  me.  The purchasing managers'  report  across  all of  itscomponents  looks  strong--in new orders,  the deliveries  stretching out,and the  prices  paid.  We  also got  very strong  housing numbers  and verystrong new orders  data.  In  short,  the  new data  suggest  to me  that  theeconomy has more momentum than  I would  have thought;  and  in  fact  itstrikes me  that  it  wouldn't  take  a whole  lot  for me  to  begin  to  usethe word that  I've  heard a  couple of  times  in  this  go-around--anemerging  "boom."There are a couple  of  concerns  that worry me.  Number one  isthat  consumer debt  seems  to  be accelerating, and  this  is  at  a  timewhen the  ratio of  consumer debt  to worth  is  still  at  an  all-time  high.It never  came  off;  it  just  flattened out.  The  debt  service rate  camedown with lower  interest  rates but not  the  level  of  absolute  debt.And if  we get  a surge  from here, we are  going  to  be  setting all  kindsof  new records  for  the  ratio  of debt  to  income.  That  is  of particularconcern  as  it  would relate  to  the  data  that Larry Lindsey  gave us  awhile  ago.  That's pretty worrisome  in my mind.  Also,  we  seem  to meto be  experiencing a rather  euphoric  stock market;  it's  up  11  percentin  the  last  four months  and  6 percent  since  our  last meeting,  forgoodness  sake!  These  kinds  of  developments  give  me  concern that  wecould possibly be  heading  for something  that might  look  distressinglylike a bust  somewhere down  the road.On the  inflation  side, if  we  look at  things with  a fairlylong-term view, they  still  look pretty good.  But  like Tom Melzer--Ihad written down  in my notes  a couple  of  things  he  just mentioned--Ihave concerns.  Number  one  is  that  fourth-quarter CPI  of  3.4  percent,which looks  a bit  ominous.  Also,  in a world full  of  capacity, justabout  all  of  the  commodity price  indexes  that  I've  had access  to,  bothdomestic  and international,  seem to  have  a rather persistent upwarddrift.  I certainly wouldn't  try to  say  that  an  inflationary surge  isupon us  or  is  inevitable.  But  as  John Wayne used  to  say  in  his  Indianmovies,  "There's dust  on  the horizon!"

MR. LAWARE.  Well,  it  seems  to me that  the  fundamentals  ofhousing, autos,  capacity utilization, new orders,  inventory levels,and increased loan activity of  banks are  all pointing toward continuedgrowth, even stronger  growth than we  previously expected.  But  the  taxshock and the  health care uncertainties  are  still  unknown andunmeasured and are  probably the governors which will  keep  the economicengine  from running  amuck.  Perhaps even  corporate  re-engineering isnow ho-hum, at  least  for those  not getting the heave-ho.  [Laughter]Inflationary pressures  may currently be masked  and  the  resultingeuphoria in  the  financial markets probably has bloated stock and bondprices beyond rational  values.  That may be built more  on profitexpectations  than on  actual profit performance.  In  short,  I think weare now in a period where  the expansionary  forces  in  the  economy  seemto  be emerging  as  the  reasons  for caution  rather than thecontractionary forces  that  I had reasoned were  fundamental  before.Moderate growth seems  to be  the  consensus  forecast,  but  thepossibility of  inflationary behavior triggered by inflationaryexpectations  in  terms  of  anticipatory price increases  rather  thandemand-driven price  increases  creates  for me  a mood for  caution.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank  you.  The  sustainability of  the  recoverycertainly seems  considerably more assured now.  Leading the way arehousing, autos,  durables,  clearly reflected  in  the IP  index.  Peopleare spending  and they're dissaving  to  do  so.  Inventories  are  lean  sothere probably will be no  surprises  on  the supply  side.  Productivityimprovements  can still provide  opportunities  for competitiveness  andgrowth.  I think most  encouraging  has  been consumer  and businessconfidence;  even  the  earthquake and the  cold didn't provide muchdisruption.  So  there  is  less  chance  that we're going to have  anotherfading spell,  and I don't think that  this recovery  now can beconsidered as  fragile as  it was  a year  ago.  At  the  same  time,  strongfinancial markets  are  continuing  to provide  financing, and banks  arebetter positioned to  contribute.  We are  even making some progress  onthe  debt  side.  The  risks  and structural  adjustments facing  theeconomy are  still  there,  but I think  it's  fair to  say  that no newinsurmountable ones  are  appearing.  People may have  gotten a  bittired, as  John LaWare  mentioned, of  talking about  corporaterestructuring and defense restructuring, and the pace of  balance  sheetrestructuring appears  to  have  slackened.  On  the  international  front,there's some  glimmer  that  the  economies  of  our major trading partnersare beginning  to  bottom out,  so we may see some  improvement there.The  labor market  is  still  showing  some  signs  of  stress due  to  thelayoffs and re-engineering,  resulting  in part-time  and temporaryemployment  and downward mobility.  On  the fiscal  policy side,  I thinkthe  focus  on  the deficit may well contain  many of  the new initiatives;even the health care  proposals now appear to  be open  to  negotiations.So,  I think  there's  a bit less  to  fear  there,  and there were no greatsurprises  in  the  form of major new expensive  initiatives in  the  Stateof  the Union message.On  the  inflation  front,  the  recent numbers  certainly lookgood, particularly the  PPI  and the  deflator, and  I think the  Committeeshould be very pleased with that.  Progress  on  the underlying rate  ofinflation, while it  may still  be feasible,  certainly  is  going to  be  at2/3-4/94-28-a reduced pace at best.  I'm  a bit  concerned, though, that we arelikely to  hit  a stone  wall  over the next  few months with respect  toinflation, given the problem with  the  seasonals,  obviously, and  short-term supply distortions.  Many  of  those were mentioned around  thetable with respect  to  labor  shortages  and supply  shortages  in areaswhere demand  is particularly strong.  We may well  start  to  seecommodity price increases working  their way into  the  PPI  and CPI.  Ithink that  we're now seeing some  major risks  on the  inflation  front.Certainly,  the  Greenbook acknowledged  the  food price increases  and therisks with  respect  to  the upcoming harvest, which Tom Melzer mentionedin particular.  On the  energy front,  it's  hard for me  to  see  that weshould be  depending on  a cartel  to  keep  the  CPI  in  check.  And, ofcourse, precious metals' prices have been elevated.  Certainly, themoney numbers  are difficult  to  read but  I agree with those  around  thetable  today who  mentioned that  credit has picked up,  so  I think all  ofthese things  highlight  the  risk we now see  on  the  inflation front.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Well,  after some extended period ofa very flat  regional  economy,  economic activity in  the  Second Districthas  actually been improving  at  a moderate pace  for  about the  lastthree or  four months.  The  December establishment survey showed modestjob  gains  in New York State,  New York City,  and New Jersey.  Over  theknow are  an advance  indicator  of  personal  income, were  growing  at  amoderate  to  strong pace.  The  cold weather  conditions  seemed to  havedelayed some  output, but our  sources  feel  that  it  is  not  any worsethan  that.  The  inability of  consumers  to  get  to  the  sales  takingplace  in January slowed down some  of  the  activity at  the  retail  level,but again  our sources  feel  that  retailers can recoup  that  over  thePresident's  Day weekend, assuming  the  weather  is decent  then.  I thinkwhat's particularly  good about  the  District  is  that,  despite  the  factthat  we have  the  corporate  giants  like  IBM, Citibank, and Kodakdownsizing, New York State  gained  15,000  jobs  from November togains  in  the area.  New York  City also had some  growth  in  jobs  as  didour part,  the northern part,  of  New Jersey.With regard to  the  national  forecast, we are rather  similarto  the Greenbook with  some  exceptions.  We have  stronger real  growthin  the  second half  of  1994.  Some  of  that  comes, as  does  somewhatstronger growth  in  1995,  from  our view  that residential  constructionwill be  somewhat  higher than  the  staff  forecast has indicated.  That'san area  in which there  are  some  capacity constraints,  so  it  could bean additional  cause of  some  inflationary pressures.  In general,  wethink the  gap between  actual  and potential GDP  is now quite small,  andcertainly  that which remains will  be used up  in the  course of  1994with our  forecast,  the Greenbook's,  or  any  of  those we've heard aroundthe  table.  Consequently, with the  unemployment rate  coming down towhat we  think is  a reasonable estimate of  the NAIRU--in  the low  6percent area--we do  have to  be  considerably concerned about  inflation.And  our  inflation forecast  is,  in  fact,  somewhat higher  than  that ofthe Greenbook.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank  you.  We've  completed  the  generaldiscussion that  we usually have  on  the  first day of  Humphrey-Hawkinsmeetings.  As  I mentioned earlier, we're  going to  reverse  the  schedule2/3-4/94-29-tomorrow to deal  with the  short-term monetary policy questions  firstand  then go  to  the long-term ranges.  The  question  I want  to  raisethis  evening before we  close  is  one  that has  been tugging  at me  forthe  last number  of weeks.  This  really gets  to  the  issue  that  when wemove  in this  particular  context, which of  course  will be  the  firsttime we have  moved since  September  1992,  we are going  to  have  to makeour action very visible.  It's more  the  equivalent of  a discount  ratemove  than the  incremental  federal  funds  rate  changes  that  we have beenembarking on  for  quite  a  long period of  time.  I am particularlyconcerned that  if  we  choose  to move  tomorrow, we make  certain  thatthere is  no  ambiguity about  our move.  My understanding  of  thetechnical  conditions  in  the  funds market is  that  it  looks  as  thoughthe  funds  rate will  probably be  edging above  3 percent,  and  in  thecircumstances  a draining  action will be  unambiguous  to  theprofessionals.  But  I'm not sure  that  more widespread recognition willcome  out very quickly;  it  will  sort  of  dribble  out.  Under  ordinarycircumstances,  that  is  not  only fine  but  desirable.  One  of  the  thingsthat we have  argued,  and  I would continue  to  argue,  is  that  there  is  adistinction between a  discount  rate  and a  federal  funds  rate  action  inthe  sense  that  we  don't want  an announcement  effect  ordinarily  on  thefunds  rate.  It  gives us  a much more  calibrated instrument.  But  afederal  funds  change in  this  particular instance  is  a discount ratechange,  as  far as  the  Federal  Reserve  System  is  concerned.  I'm  verystrongly inclined  to make  it  clear that  we  are doing  this but  to  finda way to  do  it  that  does  not  set  a precedent.I understand that  that is  not  at  all  easy to  do, but  if  weare  going to  make changes  as  to how we structure  our  Minutes  and ourannouncements  and responses  to various  developments, we need a  lot  oftime  in  this  Committee  to  discuss  the  pros  and cons.  There  really arelots  of  pros  and cons,  of  which  I think we are  all  aware.  But we  aregoing  to have  to  deal  with this  issue  in  conjunction with  the  questionof  transcripts  and tapes  and all  of  the  other disclosure  issues.  Oneof  the  reasons  that  I  thought  it  was  not  desirable  to  discuss  it  atthis  meeting  is  that  there  is  clearly a  time problem.  There  also willbe  a lot  of  significant,  useful  evidence  for us  in our  deliberationswhen we  see  how everyone responds  to  our  releasing the  last  fourtranscripts of  1988 meetings when they are done.  We'll  get  a muchbetter  sense  of  the  reactions.  So,  I'm caught  in  this particularsituation where  I  would  feel  very uncomfortable  if when  we make  amove--whether  it's  tomorrow or  next  month--we do  not make  it  veryclear that  we are moving.  The  only  issue  on  the table  tonight  is  thatif  we  decide  to  move  tomorrow--and that we will  get  to when we resumethe  meeting at  9:00  tomorrow morning--I  would very much  like  to  havethe  permission of  the  Committee to  announce  that we're  doing it  and  tostate that  the  announcement  is  an  extraordinary event.  The majorreason would be  that  it's  a  Friday and we  rarely meet  on  Fridays.This  is  a very unusual  circumstance.  So  I'd  like  the permission ofthe Committee  to  try to  formulate  a  couple  of  sentences which  state(1) that  we have moved,  assuming we  do  that,  and  (2) that  thisannouncement  of  the  move  is  not precedential.  We will  try to  find  away to  say what  is  special  about  this  particular day and  thisparticular  event.  So,  I open  it up  for  everyone's  comments.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Mr. Chairman,  I have a  lot  sympathy with what  yousuggest,  and  it  strikes  me  that  there's  another information-gatheringadvantage--2/3-4/94-30-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Excuse me,  could I just make  one finalcomment before you go  on?  While  I myself,  as you know, have beenstrongly opposed  in  the past--and  I have testified  against  announcingwhen we are making a move  since  it  does  reduce our  flexibility--thatissue  is  still  on  the  table  and  it's a much broader issue.  The issueof whether  something  is precedential  or not  is  under our  control.  Wedon't have  to  announce our policy moves;  there's nothing forcing us  todo  so,  and  I cannot believe that  there will  be  legislation requiringthat.  So,  the  issue  is not whether  if  we  do  something, we will beforced  to do  it  again.  I think we  can avoid that.  We may decide forreasons  other  than basic  policy to  continue, but  I see no  reason forsuch an announcement  to be  a precedent nor do  I see any likelihood  oflegislation requiring  that  because  the  thrust of  what's  been happeningon  the Hill  doesn't  strike me  as  leading  in that  direction.  Anyway,sorry  for  the  interruption.  Go  ahead, Mr. Syron.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  All  I was  saying is  this:  Just  as you thought,appropriately,  that  it's worth  seeing when we put  out  the  transcriptswhat  the  reaction is  going  to be,  we'll  also get  information  if wefollow this  course  from what  the reaction is  to  it.  There will beinformation  in  terms  of market and Congressional  reactions,  and soforth.  If  essentially we  tell  the  financial  markets what  our policyis  at  11:23  of  the morning after our meeting--if  it  is  really the  casethat  by our market  operations we  generally do  that--I  have a lot  ofsympathy for  doing it  more  explicitly the  evening before.  My own viewis  that by  doing this  once we will  get  some  information  on reactionsand we may  find out  what its weight  is.  My own  forecast would be  thatthis would pull  the  teeth  in  a longer-term sense,  which we are  notresolving now, on a lot  of  these  issues about  disclosure.  I knowthese  issues wouldn't  all  go away, but  the essential  information  iswhat  the  final  score  of  the  game  is.  The rest  of  it  is  akin  tofinding out what play  Emmitt Smith was  asked to  run  on third down.  SoI think there  is  a lot  to  be  gained  from  this without  locking  us  intoa longer-term arrangement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Si.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  I'm not  quite  clear  on  the precedential  side ofthis.  Are you saying  this would be  an announcement  that we havetightened without  a discount rate  change or with  a discount ratechange?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  answer  is  no discount rate  action.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But  the point here  is  that when we movethe  discount  rate, we're hitting  a  "gong."  What  I'm  saying  is  thatthe  first  time we move  the  funds  rate  after this  extended period, weare  hitting a  "gong."it.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  That's right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And I think we ought  to  stand up and hit

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  I agree with  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other  comments?  Bob.2/3-4/94-31-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  I would very much  support  issuing a statement.  Ithink it's  very important  that  the  statement exactly  coincide  with ourtaking action  in  the market  and not  be  either before  or after  takingaction.  I also  feel  that  we  ought  to have  a discussion as  quickly asis  feasible  about the  desirability of  similar statements  in  the  futurebecause  I  think some  of  us  believe  there  is  some  advantage  to  doing  iton  a continued basis.  Perhaps  we  could deal  with  this  issueexplicitly  in  the not-too-distant  future  along with  the other  issuesthat  you mentioned.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You don't  mean in  a special  meeting butas  part  of  the  next meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes,  but  I really  think that  there  is  an urgency.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Bob Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I understand your rationale.I'd  just  like  to  express  a couple of  concerns,  and you've hit  on  themalready.  One  is  with respect  to  the  process  and  the other  issubstance.  It  strikes  me  that  this  is  a very major  change  in  the  waywe  are  operating and we haven't  had very much  time  to  reflect  on  this.As  Bob Parry  just  indicated, I  think  it  is  essential  that  we  do  havethat  discussion as  soon  as  we  can.  My more  serious  concern  is  whetherwe  can keep  this  non-precedential.  I have a real  concern  that  there'sa risk that we're going  to be pushed by pressures--not necessarilylegislation but  other pressures--to make  this  an  ongoing  operatingprocedure.  If  that's  the  case,  I think we would  lose  someflexibility.  The  other thing  that  occurs  to  me  is  that  if  we  areforced by this action  to  do  it  on  a regular basis,  the  discount  rateis  going to  lose  its  effectiveness  and along with  that  theeffectiveness  of  our  directors.  So,  those  are  concerns  that  I thinkwe  need  to  reflect  on,  if  indeed our  announcement does  for  some  reasonbecome a precedent.  However, having  said that,  if  we can  draft  astatement  that clearly  indicates  this  is  not  a precedent but  a  one-time  event  because  of  the peculiar  circumstances,  then  I would  supportyour recommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I thought your  Congressional  testimony  lastMonday was well  constructed and made  the points  that  you needed  tomake in  the right  way.  I was  initially quite  discouraged with thewire service  stories  as  they came  out,  which seemed  totally  to missthe point you were  trying  to  convey.  But  then the  stories  that  cameout  in  some  of  the major  dailies  restored my confidence  that maybewe're  making a little progress  in conveying our views.  I thought  boththe New York Times and  the Wall Street  Journal--or at  least  one  of  theWall  Street  Journal pieces--treated  it  as  we would have  hoped.  Basedon what you  said there  and  the way  that went,  I would trust  that  youwouldn't  be  saying that  "the Committee  tightened,"  using  that kind  ofjargon but  rather that  because  of  the  nature of  the  change beingcontemplated--and it  doesn't  matter whether it's  tomorrow or  at  theupward direction on  interest  rates.  And it's  not  just  that  it  wouldbe  the  first  change  since  September  1992;  it's  the  first change upwardin some  five years.  Without  repeating all  the  discussion  that we  hadin December  about  the  importance  of  a  rate  increase being  clearly2/3-4/94-32-understood as  being an action  of  the  Committee,  the  rationale for  itas  a growth-sustaining move  is  extremely  important.  Only by puttingout  a  statement can we  get  that  message  out  there,  or at  least make  aneffort  to  say that  this  is  not  an  anti-growth move but  one  that  isdesigned  to  enhance  the  longevity  of  this  expansion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  was  actually the  closing paragraphin my testimony.  Tom  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I understand the  sensitivity  ofthis.  I have a hard  time understanding how this  would not  beprecedential.  If  we  say it  is  desirable to  announce this  time  becauseit  makes  sense and we've got  this  issue  of a Friday  and  so  forth,  Ithink  it will  be difficult  from a credibility point  of view to  argueagainst  announcing  in  the  future  should we want to make that  argument.Even  if  we have  to  start  our meeting earlier tomorrow,  I'm wonderingif  we  cannot  position  ourselves to  know whether we want  to  take  anaction  tomorrow, and  then do  so.  Then, as  the  questions  come  in,  wecan validate  that we did  in  fact  take  an action so  that  we're notmaking  a  statement  which  sets  a precedent.  I think we  are going  toset  a precedent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well,  I certainly agree  that  there  is  arisk  involved, but  I disagree  that we  can be forced  to do  it  for  otherthan  legislative reasons.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Well,  we may not  be  forced but  I think thecredibility  of  our position will  be  compromised.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We're  saying there  are  different  typesof  changes.  For  example,  in  1979  there was  a major  change.  ChairmanVolcker  and his  staff went out  and had a big press  conference.  Thereare  certain  individual  events  where periodically  the Federal  Reservehas made  special  statements;  I'm merely  stipulating that  this  is  oneof  them.  Frankly, with the  exception  of  the  stock market  crash inassume,  for  example, that we  decide  to  move tomorrow and we make  anannouncement,  and  then we decide  to  move  again, say,  four weeks  later.I don't see  any reason why a  statement  would be  appropriate  at  thatlater  time.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I'm uneasy  about  that, but  I understand whatyou're  saying.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Look,  I'm  not naive  enough  to believethat  it  doesn't create precedential  issues when we  do  things  that aredifferent.  But  I think the  question  is  can we  control  it,  and in myjudgment we  can.  Tom Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  On  the  precedent point, Alan,  I would just  saythat  another  point to  consider here  is  the Treasury  funding next week.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  If  we wanted another rationale, namely thatthere be  no  confusion  in the  marketplace,  that might be  another.2/3-4/94-33-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  I think that  is  one  of  the possiblepoints  for  discussion.  Joan wants  to  think  about  that.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Okay.  Well,  there  is  at  least  one audience  outthere that wouldn't  like  to  hear  that.  I think there  is  a risk of  aheadline along  the  lines of  "In  an unprecedented move,  the Fedannounced...,  saying  it wasn't  setting a precedent."  But where  I comeout  is  that  in  the  climate we're in  and  in view of  this  inflectionpoint  after  five years,  as  Jerry Jordan  pointed out,  these  are uniquecircumstances.  And  openness,  given what we've been  through  in generalduring  this  period, is  probably a pretty good course.  I think howmuch  is  said is  important.  I personally would  favor  saying,  "The Fedabout  it.  It  would trouble me  if  we got  into  expectations about  wherethe  funds  rate  would trade.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me read what Don Kohn handed mebefore.  "The Federal  Reserve  announced  today a  slight  increase  in  thedegree  of pressure  on  reserve positions."

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Then he  went on  and  said,  "This actionis  expected  to be  associated with a small  increase  in short-term money

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I think  that's  all  right.  I don't  think weshould be  giving a  target range,  though.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mean  the  actual  number?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  No,  that  is  not  our  intent.

[SECTION]

MR.  MELZER.  That  has been  advocated at  times  in  otherdiscussions here.  Also,  if  we're  announcing  a decision--and  thiswould be  a legal question--are  we  obligated to say anything  about  thevote,  for example?  I'm not  sure.  Again,  I'd prefer  just  to  say whatthe  action was.  It's  a decision of  the  Committee, but  if  we  get  intodisclosing the  vote, that  begins  to  set  other  types  of precedents  thatcould be  relevant when we  get  to  the point  of deciding  this  issue  on apermanent basis.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Look, the  main issue  here  is  that,  asfar  as  I'm concerned,  I would like us  to stand up and be  counted.  Weare  the central  bank and we are making  a major move.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Right,  I agree.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  And to  do  it  in an  ambiguous manner  Ithink is  unbecoming of  this  institution.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  No,  I didn't  mean to  suggest  otherwise.  I  agreewe  should do  that,  but  the point  I was  raising is  that  there may be  alegal  question.  If  we have  announced a decision, does  it  follow  thatwe have  to  disclose  the vote?2/3-4/94-34-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN. I  don't  see  why. Is  Virgil  Mattinglyhere?

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  No, there's  no  legal  question.  The  Chairmanbefore  in Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony has  said something about policyand  what  the  Committee  has  done  without  announcing  a  vote.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  correct,  isn't  it?  Were we  tocome  out  and make a  statement  that  the Committee made a decision,  arewe  obligated to  stipulate what  the vote  is?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  If  somebody  asked, you would have  to  tellthem.  In  other  words, it  would  be  subject  to  disclosure.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Why?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  The Freedom of  Information Act.  The  legalissue  is:  Why  is  it confidential?  What's  confidential  about thevote?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  It's  confidential now.

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  Yes, but  if  you disclose  the  action--

[SECTION]

MR.  SYRON. Then  you'd  have  to  disclose  the  vote?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN. You  know, there  is  an  interestingdifference here.  The  difference is  that  if we  are asked after  theaction has been disclosed.  That's--

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Very different.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well,  you may be  right;  there may be aSo  long  as  we  don't  disclose  it  and  dolegal  question  of  disclosure. so  only in  response  to a question--

[SECTION]

MR.  MELZER. Of  course,  we  might  not  get  asked.

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  Oh, believe me, you will  get  asked!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  the reason  I'm bringing  it up--and  this  ismore relevant  to  the  discussion we're  going to  have  down  the road--isthat  if  we go  this way, the  effect of  that  is  to  place the minorityrather  than  the  majority  in terms  of  who  the  pressmight be  interested in talking  to,  which might  not  be  optimal.  Justone  other point:  I agree with Bob Parry.  I agreed with deferring thediscussion  of  our  recordkeeping  issues  and  so  forth,  but  I  think  weshould  get  to  that  promptly. if  we  could  getto  that  at  the  next  meeting,  that  would  be  highly  desirable.From  my  point  of  view, the  limelight  in 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't  see any  reason why we  shouldn'tbe  able  to  get  to  it. meeting  from  the  1988  transcripts  that  we  should  know.We  should  have  enough  reaction  at  the  next

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  The mini-series will be out!2/3-4/94-35-

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Committees  could do  mortal  damage  to pressreleases, but  I really wonder if  we  want  to use  the  term  "smallincrease"  rather  than  just  "increase."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would stay with small.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  We're not writing a press  release.

[SECTION]

MR.  SYRON.  We're  not writing  a press  release and  if  we  don'tsay  "small,"  people will  think we've made  the  announcement becauseit's  a  1/2  point  or 3/4  point  increase  or  something like  that.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  It  sounds  like we've made  a policy decisionalready!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I think that's  a  little premature.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can  I make  the  following request?  I'mnot  asking the  Committee  to make  a statement.  I'm  asking  theCommittee  to  give me  the authority  to make  the  statement  so  that  ineffect  it's  one  step removed.  As  announcements  go,  it's  very short.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  I was  going  to  take  a word out!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I'm  supportive of  what you want  to  do.  I thinkthis  is  one of  those  special  times,  and I think we  have  to  be  carefulthat  we  don't become captive  to  our own procedures  when we are  calledupon to  do  something.  There  is  a precedent  for  our making  these kindsof  announcements  for special  occasions.  They don't  happen very often,but  I believe  this  is  one  of  those times.  While  clearly the precedentis  there,  and we'd all  be naive  to  think that  this  doesn't  tilt  thescales  in that  direction,  there  is  also  a risk in  not disclosingtomorrow.  If  there were  a premature  leak  or any  confusion ormisunderstanding about  any action taken  tomorrow,  it  seems  to me  thatthat  would be  far more costly  than whatever  the  precedential  risk isin going  forward with  this  as  you suggest.  I agree with you that  itought to  be your  statement  as  the  Chairman rather than an announcementof  the  Committee.  I sympathize with your desire  to make  it  short.However,  I think  it  is  good  to  get  the right  focus  on this,  and Iliked the way you ended your  testimony on  Monday about putting this  inthe  context  of  being pro  sustainable growth rather  than  fostering thisnotion  that we are against  growth.  I would urge  you in the  statementto hark back to  your  testimony on Monday;  I have  forgotten  the precisewording  in the  last  sentence  or  two  in  the  last paragraph but  Ithought  that captured  the  essence  of what  we're doing very well.  Atthe risk  of  this  statement  being a little  longer  than you may want,I'd just put  in  that  last paragraph--or  the  last  couple  of  sentences--from your  testimony.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I actually had two  questions.  When are the1988  transcripts  to be released?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Donald Kohn.2/3-4/94-36-

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We've done  a  few of  them;  Norm, where are we?Let's  toss  the ball  back down there.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I feel  like  I'm in  a tennis  match here!

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  We have  about  three of  them just  about  done.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Really?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The  last  three  of  1988?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  No.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The  first  two  and  the  last  one.  Work on

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  When do  you guess  1988  will becompleted?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The  third week of  February.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Then they have  to  go  through  an  international  andlegal  redaction process.  But  I think  it's  reasonable  to--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Our  next meeting  is March when?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  22nd.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  I think we  need two  to  three weeksof  response  time.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Right.  What  if  we put  out part  of  the year?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  The  first  six months?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You know we could put  out--you  see,  theproblem is  that  in  the middle of  1988  there  are  garbled transcripts;The  taping  system broke down.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Why  is  it  that  life  can never be simple?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  are  18  minutes of  tape missing!

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  So  it's  not  next week that  these are  comingout?so?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  It's probably going  to  be at  least a month or

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Maybe;  probably  about a month.  If  it'smore than  a month, I  think we may want  to reconsider  getting outwhatever we've  completed because we can  certainly do  the  last  threemeetings  in  1988.  That's  the most  recent.  In  fact,  in  a sense  that'swhere  our obligation  is;  the most  recent  is  really the most  important2/3-4/94-37-in  that  respect  as we move back.  I think  there will  be a  lot ofinterest  in the  stock market  crash discussion.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That would be  the  end of  1987.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  A point  of  clarification related  to  what EdBoehne  said:  It  seems  to me  that  it  would be beneficial  if  yourstatement were made on behalf  of  the  FOMC.  Is  that  what you werethinking?  It  didn't  sound  that way  to  me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would not  do  that.  I don't  thinkthat's  a good idea.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  You don't?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  "Chairman Greenspan  said  today."

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Yes,  that's  exactly right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Now, if  we  decide  to  do  it  on  apermanent  basis,  then  it's  a Committee  issue.  But marginally it's  ofa less  precedential  nature  if  I do  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  If  it  doesn't work,  the  Committee  could  fire  theChairman!

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Well, maybe we  ought to  bring  that  issueup before  that  vote!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I wanted to  ask Joan, or  Bill  from your  formercapacity, what do  you  think the  market  reaction would be?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Well,  it  certainly would remove  any  ambiguityabout  the move.  [Laughter]  People don't  have  to  guess about  the  sizeof  the  move and that  kind of  thing;  I guess  if  there's  a pro,  that'sthe positive  outcome.  In  terms  of  setting  a precedent,  I think itvery much depends  on  the wording  that's  used.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Is  this  going to be  helpful,  do you  think,  ornot  helpful  in terms  of  the market absorbing what  is  occurring?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  I  think that  it  can't  be harmful.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Another word for  "minimal."

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  No,  it  tells  everybody what's happening and  itleaves  no room for  ambiguity, and if  it's  phrased the way you aresuggesting,  it's  not  setting a  stage  for people  to have  expectationsof  an announcement  every time  there  is  a policy change  going forward.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree with you completely.  Ithink that  it's  right  for  you  to make  the  statement because you havethe authority.  The  Committee  is  not  establishing  a precedent;  wealways can  fire  you.  And you  are making  the judgment  that  this  is  an2/3-4/94-38-instance where  you want to  speak.  In  fact,  I would go  so  far  as  tosuggest,  although you know what  we want--we've  already  said  it--thatwe  not dictate  to you what you're  going  to  say because  it  should beonly your  statement.  That  way there is  absolutely no  precedent;  youare  simply acting  as  Chairman of  this  Committee.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I very much  support what  GovernorLindsey just  said.  I  think this  is  something  that we  absolutely mustdo  because of  the  importance of  this.  As Jerry Jordan  said, thiswould be  the  first  time  that we've  increased--if  we  do  so--interestrates  since  1989.  And,  therefore,  it  is  something that  we  should stepforth and  state.  I believe  as  Larry said that  you should be  doing  itin your  words.  We might  have  to think rather  carefully about  theprecise  timing  of  the Desk's  action in  relationship  to  anyannouncement  that may be made  tomorrow.  I'd be very worried if  theDesk's  action were  first.  Then we would be giving  some  essentialwas  informed.  So,  if  you can't  do  it  simultaneously, I would  favorany  statement by you  coming  out  marginally ahead  of  that  time,  butdefinitely not  behind  it.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I think simultaneous  is  risky, frankly.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  I agree with  that.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Why don't  you put  it  out  at  11:00  a.m.  orsomething  like  that?  Is  11:30  a.m. when you conduct  your operations?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  If  you did  it  by  11  a.m.--

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  It's  very risky sometimes  to  try  to  time  thingsdown  to  the  wire and hope that  people pick up  the press  releases.

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  I  think it  just  takes a couple of  minutes  for  thewires  to  get  it  on.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Gary.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I'm  comfortable with what you  are proposing.  Ihappen  to  agree with those who  think this  will  turn out  to beprecedential  and from my perspective that's  fine because  I think we'vebeen  in an  awkward situation where we  have kind of  acknowledged thatpeople  in  the markets  get  the news  and the  signal  immediately, but  forthose who  are not  close  to  the  markets  the news  kind of  dribbles  outdepending on how quickly  they read the  financial press  or  consultother  sources  of  information.  But  I mention that now only toreemphasize  the point  that Bob  Parry and Tom Melzer made, which isthat we  really  do need  to  come  to  grips  with this whole host  of  issuesabout what records  we keep  and what we disclose  and when we discloseit,  and so  on and  so  forth.2/3-4/94-39-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mean they are  all  related issues  inother words.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's  all  one package.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  And I think we  better get  on with thatdiscussion.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr. Chairman, the  former Mullins Subcommittee,whatever  it  is  now, is  to meet  on this  issue  tomorrow after  the  FOMCmeeting,  so  I don't  think there's  any reason why  the Subcommitteecan't  put  the  finishing touches  on whatever  recommendations  it  isgoing  to  make  in  the very near  term and get  them out  to  the  members.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman, Ed Boehne  really made my point.There are  certainly risks  of  doing  this  and they have been well  statedhere.  But  there  are  risks  of  not doing  this.  If  there were  anyconfusion tomorrow going  into  the weekend  or  this  thing gets playedout  in  the New York Times  on Saturday and  Sunday  or on  CNN,  I think wewould have a real  mess.  I certainly also  agree  that  this  should beyour  statement  and you ought  to  say whatever you're  comfortable with.My  feeling is  it  ought  to  be  as  brief  as  possible.  I don't  think youneed  to  say a  lot;  if  we  do  it,  this  is  not  going  to be  an unexpectedmove.  If  there  is  an effort  to  defend it  or  explain  it  in  any detail,then  I think  it  would exacerbate  the problem of  precedent  before wetry to  figure  out what we're  going  to  do  in  the  longer run.  I alsosupport Gary Stern and Tom Melzer  and Bob  Parry on  the need to  decideas  quickly as possible.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The purpose  of  accepting  the  JointEconomic  Committee's  invitation  to  testify before  this meeting wasprecisely  to move ahead  of  the  curve  on  potential explanations  in  theevent  they were  required of  us.  In a  sense  that  statement was, as  faras  I can  judge,  the  basis of what we've  been doing.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  You  can reference your JEC  statement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  I possibly  could.  PresidentMcTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Just  for  the  record, Mr. Chairman,  I agree withyour  suggestion and all  of  its  details.  I personally wouldn't  mindseeing  it become  a precedent.  I've  argued before  that  quick releaseof the  decision  is much more  desirable than verbatim minutes  ortranscripts,  and  I  think that quick release of  the decision might  takeoff some pressure  for early release  in  these other areas.  I knowthat's  something  to be discussed  later and  I agree with yourrecommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman, I think this  is  a very importantquestion.  It's  had a very good airing,  and I don't  have  anything to2/3-4/94-40-add to what has  been said.  I fully support your  request  andrecommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Does  anybody else  want to  raise an  issueor  question?  Well, why don't we  adjourn  this  evening.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr.  Chairman?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  Don.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  You  asked me  to  remind you  to  remind the  Committeeof  the highly confidential  nature  of  the  subjects  being discussed, andthe  fact  that you would take drastic  measures  if  something wereleaked.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Nobody would want  that!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  just  reiterate basically what  Donsaid.  If  we end up tomorrow morning with anything  in the  newspapers,one  way or  the  other, or  any public  indication of what  it  is  we'vediscussed  today  in any respect,  I think it will  do  very grave damageto  this  institution.  And the Wall  Street Journal  the  Post,  and theTimes  all,  of  course,  know that we  are meeting;  they know  it's  acrucial meeting.  There will be all  sorts  of  endeavors  to  get  someinformation,  directly, indirectly,  or  otherwise.  I just  beseech youto be  as  careful  as you possibly can and not even tell  your doormanwhere you've been!

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Maybe you  could just  have some  jam andhamburgers  sent  in;  we  could  spend the night here.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mike  Prell has  some  information for uson  the employment  statistics.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Earlier  this morning I had a brief  discussionwith a senior  official  at  the  Bureau of  Labor  Statistics.  Thecivilian unemployment  rate  for  January was reported at  6.7  percentunder  the new survey.  They have two  econometric  models  that  they areusing  to  try  to give people  some  guidance  about how the  month-to-monthmovements  in  the unemployment rate might  have  looked if  the new surveyhad been  in  place  in December or  if  the old  survey had remained ineffect  in January.  On  the  basis  of  their model  of  what the  old surveywould have done,  they estimate  that  the unemployment  rate would havedropped  0.1  percent  in  January.  Their model  of  what  the new  surveywould have done  is  that  it  would have dropped  0.3  percent.  There is  aconsiderable  range;  the  household series  is  clearly subject  to  a lotof  uncertainty.  There was  a huge  increase,  1.3  million, in  thehousehold  employment total.  As  I indicated,  there are  both the changein the  new monthly  survey plus  an adjustment  for a Census  updateinvolved here.  A rough guess  is  that,  if  you took out  those  twospecial  effects,  the month-to-month change might  have been in  the  areaof  150,000  or  maybe  a little  higher, but  that  is  a very crude guess  atthis point.  The  labor  force  participation rate was  66.7;  it  had been66.3  in  December.  One  might have expected  an upward movement from  thechange  in  the  survey of  1/2  percent  or more.  And  so  on  that  basis  itlooks as  if  the  labor  force participation rate might have  dropped andcontributed  to  that decline  in  the unemployment  rate,  all  other thingsequal.  Again, this  is  very difficult  to read.  The nonfarm payrollincrease was  62,000--72,000  for private  industry--well below marketexpectations  and below what we had been expecting  for  the near  term.Manufacturing was  up 26,000  but  construction was  down 3,000  andprivate  service-producing  industries had an  increase of  51,000.  Therewere no  large revisions  to  the prior  couple of  months.The  Labor Department believes  that weather had a seriouseffect on  the  payroll  increases,  particularly in  construction.  Theynoted that  in parts  of  the  country that  we wouldn't expect  to  be muchaffected by weather at  this  time of  the  year, construction  was up,whereas  in parts  of  the north central  and eastern regions, where theweather ordinarily is  very cold, they found  that  construction wasdown.  They also pointed  to weakness  in  a number  of  other  industrygroups that  they think might have been  affected by weather, such asrecreational  amusement,  and  they mentioned that  some  collegesevidently had to  cancel  athletic events.  In  their minds  all  thesethings  evidently contributed  to  the  low increase  in payrollemployment.  Now, this may also have affected the mix of  full-time andpart-time  employment for  the  month.  The average  workweek is  estimatedto have  risen to  34.8  hours,  a relatively very high workweek,  from the34.5 hours  figure  in December;  that  was  revised down  from  34.6 hours.This  does  look fluky;  we've seen  ticks  up  to  this  level  sometimesrevised away a bit  and in  other  cases  just reversed.  So  this  rise mayprove  ephemeral.  The  index for  the overall  increase  in productionhours went  from  125.2  to  126.3  reflecting that workweek increase.Actually, the way  the arithmetic  goes,  they report  the hours,  thenderive  the  average workweek.  But  that's  the  better part  of  a2/3-4/94-42-percentage point.  That's  a much  stronger  start  on the  quarter than wehad anticipated.Overall,  taking all  of  these  things  into account,  my readingof  this would be  that  there  are  signs  that perhaps  the  outlook is  abit  stronger  than we had anticipated in  the Greenbook  and wouldprobably imply  our  leaning more  toward raising our  first-quarter GDPforecast  rather than  lowering  it.  Given the  very strong car  salesthat  were reported yesterday, that  gives  some greater  credibility tothe production  schedules  for  February and March.  That  output will beneeded to keep  inventories  from being utterly depleted even if  salesdon't maintain their January pace.  That,  too,  argues  for some upsiderisk to  the  4 percent  GDP  forecast we made.One  final  note on  average hourly earnings:  They were up  .7in  January.  Again,  this may have been affected seriously by the  shiftin  the  industry mix and more  importantly in  all  likelihood the  shiftin  terms  of part-time/full-time employment  and so  on.  So,  I don'tthink one would want  to read that  number  too  closely either,  but  itcertainly does  look as  if  it's  on  the  firm side  of our  expectationsfor  the  start  of  the quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  How are  financial  markets  interpreting  that?

[SECTION]

MS. LOVETT.  Initially,  the market moved up by almost  a pointat  the  long end--at  the 30-year  mark--as the  headline news  on  thenonfarm number came  across  the wire.  There has  been  some  backing awayfrom that.  The market  is  still  up;  it  was up  about  3/8  to  1/2  when wecame  in here.  It may be that market participants are trying  to readthrough some  of  the  underlying  data in  terms  of  hours  and  so  forth.So,  it's  lost  some  of  its  initial  gain, but  it  is  still  up

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  just go  get  the  latest  report.[Secretary's  note:  Chairman Greenspan left  the meeting very brieflyat  this  point.]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The other  interesting aspect  was  that  bill rateswent down 3 or 4 basis points  and the  funds  rate,  which had opened at3-1/8  to  3-3/16,  went  down to  3 to  3-1/16  and remained there.  So  insome  sense at  least  the certainty of  firming today was  taken  out bythe  employment numbers.  Now, maybe  as  the bond market  and everyoneelse reassesses  them, the  adjustment  will be  reversed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  long end is  now down 3/32.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  They got  to  the  last page  of  the  release!

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I was  just  handed Commissioner Abrahams'sstatement  and she  indicates  here  that  "weather appears  to  have playeda major role in  the relatively  small rise  in payroll  employmentbetween December  and January.  The  reference week for  the  survey wasthe week before  the  California  earthquake and the East  coast  snow andice  storms;  the  extreme cold over much  of  the nation during thereference week held down employment.  Indeed,  the weakness  in  thepayroll  survey was  quite  concentrated in weather-sensitive  industriesin January, while other industries  continued the  pattern of moderategrowth that has prevailed for  some time."  And then  she goes  on toprovide detail  for  some of  these  industries.  I guess  the person I2/3-4/94-43-talked to  at  BLS  was  reading  from  this  or had written  this!  One  otherpoint  I might make  is  that,  looking at  the manufacturing  data, theworkweek remained at  its  recent  high level.  The  workweek employmentincrease  was  in motor vehicles;  outside  of  motor  vehicles  there  wasn'tany  gain.  But  overall  this  looks  consistent  with a moderate  increasein  industrial  production.  That's  even  allowing for what  we  thinkwould have been  some  loss  during  the month  from the  freeze  and  theearthquake.  I think the  industrial  production picture  for January  isat  least  as  strong  as we  anticipated when  we prepared  the  Greenbookforecast.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I didn't  quite catch what you  said about  theold survey;  is  that  down 0.1  for  the month  of  January?

MR. PRELL.  The  econometric  model  that  they have used wouldhave predicted  that.  If  I'm  looking at  the  right  place  in the  pressrelease,  it  says:  "Another tool  that we  are providing analysts  is  ourmodel  of  what  the  January 1994  unemployment  rate would have been underthe  old methods  based on  the historical  relationships betweenemployment,  the unemployment  rate,  and other  economic  indicators:  thatrate  is  6.3  percent."

MR. LINDSEY.  I notice  that  the hours  were way up,  from 125.2to  126.3.  Is  that  the basis  of your  higher  GDP  forecast?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  that's  the  key element  in my judgment  thatwould probably raise  the  forecast.  But  these numbers  are  all  beingaffected by weather;  evidently, we're  going  to  have  to  sort  throughthe  data  to  get  a more refined assessment.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If  you  take  those hours  that were givenand you  assume that  the average workweek didn't  change,  payrollemployment goes  up about  700,000.

MR. KOHN.  I just  got  a market  update.  The  long  end is  nowoff  5/32,  which puts  it  about  2/32  below what  I had written down at8:29  and  59  seconds  a.m.  [Laughter]  But  the  funds  rate  is  still  at3-1/16;  bill  rates  are  still  down 4 basis points.  We  took a readingon the  fed funds  futures  market  at  8:55  a.m. and  that  suggested, atleast  at  that  time,  a substantial  lessening of  expectations  aboutFederal Reserve  action.  For  example,  the  one month  ahead futures  ratewent  from 3.26  at  the close  last night  to  3.19  at  8:55  a.m. thismorning.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?  If  not,  let me  getstarted.  Much of what I would usually say  I stated  in my testimony  onMonday before  the Joint  Economic Committee, and  I won't  belabor any ofthat.  The one  issue  that  I didn't  raise, except  in a very minor way,is  what  I consider to  be potentially dangerous upside problems  in  theinventory area.  In  looking at  inventory/sales  ratios, we  tend tocombine wholesale,  retail,  and manufacturing  at book value  levels andput  them in constant  dollars.  The  interesting  question that  thisprocedure raises  is,  does  this  appropriately capture what  is  going  on?And my answer  to  that  is  "no."  The  reason  the  answer  is  no  is  thatwhat basically determines  the  relationship  of  orders, production,consumption, and  the  like are units  of  inventory.  So,  if  you were totake  the  wholesale and retail  inventory data, whose  inventory/salesratios  are  trending upward much more than  in manufacturing, strip  outthe markups  to  put  them back to  factory level  values  and  adjust themanufacturing data  to  factory level  values, which  is  essentially  athree major components.  But  since manufacturing has been  going down,it  all  of  a sudden has  a big  impact  on  the  total.  Even when you stripout  work-in-process, what you get  in  terms of  gross  days'  supply  is  aNow, the  one  thing  we know about  forecasting  is  that wheninventories  go  to  zero,  the  rate of  change  cannot remain negative!There  are models,  incidentally,  that  don't necessarily have  thatconstraint!  But  the  reason I raise  this question is  that  we're seeinga very tranquil  inventory situation.  The use  of  just-in-timeinventory management  is  becoming increasingly evident.  The  lead timeson  the deliveries  of  materials  ordered are  flat  and  low.  There  hasbeen  some minor  increase in  the delays  of  deliveries,  which is  usuallya sign  of  some  tightening.  But we have  a very  interesting problemhere:  How far down can  inventory/sales  ratios  continue to  go?The  forecast that  we  saw yesterday in  the Chart  Show showed agradual  flattening out.  The  truth  of  the matter  is  that  I don't knowhow they did it,  but  I know what  they don't  know.  And what  they don'tknow  is  what's going  to  happen  to  that particular ratio.  If we  beginto get  any evidence  of  either a pickup  in materials  costs--and ananticipatory  element is  involved--or any evidence of  a tightening oflead times  on  deliveries, which occurs when  the operating  rates beginto move  up, purchasing managers will  start  to  increase their  inventoryrequirements.  It  is  apocryphal  that  everyone's  inventories now, intoday's  computer regimes, are  only  in  transit and that nobody hasanything.  That may be partly true,  but  it  can't be  wholly truebecause there's  still  a huge  amount  of  inventories  sitting in variousplaces.  Everyone may say  that  emergency stocks  in  the system rightnow are probably at  the  lowest  level  in history and  the reason  is  thecomputer  technology.  But what  I'm trying to  get  at  here  is  that  ifthere's  one  element of  tranquility  in  our forecast, which wasgradually lulling us  into  considerable complacency,  it's  on theinventory side.  That's basically what concerns  me and what veryreadily could end up as  the problem if  suddenly we  find that  insteadof  slipping back to  3 percent  GPD growth, or  2-1/2 percent  orsomething like  that,  the  numbers  stay up  there.  And the  reason  theywould stay up there  is  the  same reason they've  always  stayed up  in abusiness  cycle  expansion--that  inventory accumulation  turnsinventory/sales  ratios higher,  and that's ultimately a source  of2/3-4/94-45-business cycle  instability.  That  is  a fact which has  a great deal  ofhistory associated with it.I am still  puzzled by  the  fact  that  the balance  sheets  do notseem to be  restraining  activity by as  much as  I thought  they would,considering the  fact  that  they have not  yet  fully adjusted,  if  I mayput  it  that  way.  Clearly, balance  sheet  relationships are not back  tothose typical  of  the mid-1980s  and  I always  presumed that the  desiredrelationships  would be  more conservative,  considering what we wentthrough.  That  hypothesis  is  hard  to  hold  in  the  context  of what'sgoing on in  purchasing and new orders,  and I must  say  especially thequite  a surprise.  The chain  store  retail sales  figures were weak,weaker than expected.  However,  the  correlation that  exists  betweenthose  data and total  retail  sales  is  very low, and I'm not  even surethe  sign is  right.  So  really, those  data don't tell  us  anything.  Themotor vehicle  sales are  inputs into  the  GDP;  they are real;  theyinvolve  full  coverage;  and they do not present  any statisticalproblems  of  great  moment.So,  I concluded,  as  far  as  policy is  concerned, that  we  areat  the point where we  finally have  to  start moving  toward a somewhatless  accommodative path.  I think we  have had an extraordinarilysuccessful run  in  restoring balance  to  a disturbed economic  system.We haven't raised interest  rates  in  five years, which  is  in  itselfalmost unimaginable,  especially in  the  context  of  strong economicconditions and historically  low inflation.  I must  also  say that  thepresumption that  inflation  is  quiescent  is  getting  to be a slightlyshabby notion.  We are  seeing  things  like  the purchasing managers'reports  in January, which  showed not  a big  spike  in prices,  but  somespike.  Listening to  our  roundtable  discussion yesterday, I wasimpressed by the  fact  that  labor  shortages  still  were mentioned--notas  a big deal  but  in  a number  of  different  areas--and that  several  ofyou cited some  evidence  that  price  increases are holding.  So,  whilewe may not  find it  in  the  broader price  indexes,  there  was  at  least  aninkling that  the presumption that  inflationary  indicators are  allquiescent is,  as  I said,  sort  of  fraying at  the  seams.  I don't knowwhat  to make  of  this  0.7  increase in  average hourly earnings.  I tooka look at  the  details;  it's  basically in  the services  area;manufacturing is  up  0.3  on straight-time  earnings and 0.1  on average.That  is  consistent with part-timers  going out  of  the  system, giventhat  their average rate  is  considerably below that  of  full-timeworkers.  There may not be much there but,  as Mike  said,  thepresumption that  inflation  is  staying down is  very hard  to maintain.That doesn't  necessarily mean anything;  I suspect productivity isprobably doing better than we would expect and hence unit  labor  costsare not  going up all  that much.In  any event,  I would put  on  the table  my preference  that  atthis meeting we move  up 25  basis points.  But  if  that's not the viewof  the Committee,  I would urge  that we at  least  go  asymmetric.  ViceChairman.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I believevery strongly that we  should firm policy and that we  should do  sotoday and announce  it  today in  the manner  described in  our  lateafternoon  conversation yesterday.  Let me  give  some  of  the  reasonsthat drive me  to  this  conclusion.  We are very near potential  GDP  and2/3-4/94-46-all  of  our  forecasts,  whether  they are  fine-tunings of  the Greenbookor  right on  it,  say that we will  reach full potential  this year.  Thatwould mean that  labor market  pressures  should  show up  relatively  soonon a more  generalized basis,  and as  the  Chairman just described, theyalready  are  showing up in  some areas  of  skilled  labor.  I agree  thatan  inventory cycle  could well  be  at  hand, especially in  certain areaswhere  there are  resource constraints  already--those  involvingresidential  construction,  automobiles  and light  trucks,  and homedurable goods.Therefore, it  seems  to me  that  the  question is  not  so muchwhether we  should tighten but by how much.  And rather than  comment  onthe  alternatives of  an  asymmetric directive  and a move  of  25  basispoints,  let me  evaluate my own view of  whether the move  should be 25or  50  basis points.  Why would one  think  that  a firming  of  50  basispoints might be  appropriate?  Well,  it might be  deemed to  be closer  toa true  adjustment away from what by our  forecast  is  now excessiveaccommodation.  However, I think  there are  two  downside aspects  to  a50  basis point  firming.  First  of  all,  it  could be  interpreted--and inmy own view would be  interpreted by a fair  number of  marketparticipants--as a one-time  fix,  a one-time  adjustment which would befollowed by a  "Fed-on-hold" period.  Secondly, I think it  could bedeemed, especially  in  light  of  some  of  the discussion  in  this  town  andothers,  a macho  response, and I've  always  thought macho  responsesconfused brains  and bravado.  A 25  basis point move,  on  the  otherhand, I believe would  send the  right  signal  in  the  sense  that  theFederal  Reserve,  the central  bank,  is  being watchful,  as  it  should be.And we would be moving earlier  in  the  economic cycle  than the  Fed hasdone historically  and, therefore,  we are  doing our  job even betterthan in  the past.  I think it  would be  interpreted as  the  first  of  aseries  of moves  and thus  would be deemed,  in my view, to be a strongersignal  than a 50  basis point  increase--if  the  50  basis point  increasewere seen,  as  I believe it  would be,  as  a one-time adjustment to  befollowed by the  "Fed on hold."  So,  I support  the  recommendation ofthe Chairman that we  tighten.  My own preference  is  for  a 25  basispoint  firming  today.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Well,  as  I stated yesterday, Alan,  the  stance ofmonetary policy has  in my view been very expansionary  for the  last  twoor  three years.  Accordingly, as  I've  also mentioned, the St.  LouisBank expects  that  the  CPI will  move up  sharply  in 1994  and will moveeven higher  in  1995.  Indeed,  as you mentioned, there  may be someearly warning  signs  that the  economy's disinflationary course hasalready come  to  an  end.  It  is  my view that we  should act  now toreduce the  growth  rate of  reserves and M1  and signal  this  change witha 50  basis  point  increase in  the  federal  funds  rate target.  I favor50  basis points  rather than  a more modest amount  at  this  juncture  forthe  following reasons:  (1) I think the  stage  has been well  set for achange in policy;  (2) in my view we  are  late  in  acting;  (3) too smalla policy shift may not  convince markets  of  our  resolve  to  keepinflation  low;  and  (4) I suspect that  each successive action  couldbecome more  difficult  to  take.  That's my view on policy.Let me make  just  one  other  suggestion with respect  to  thelanguage  in  the  directive where  we describe economic and financialconditions.  I would suggest  that we  include  in  that  some  mention of2/3-4/94-47-the  behavior of M1,  the  adjusted monetary base and/or reserves  overthe  last year.  I think that  that may mitigate against  some  incorrectinterpretation of  relatively weak M2  and M3  growth and what  some mightthink  that  implies with respect  to  the  thrust of monetary policy.That's all  I have, Alan.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  For some  time,  just viewing things  from myDistrict,  I have started  to  get  the  feeling  that  it's not  a case  ofworrying about  head winds  but rather of  building tail winds.  Andafter  listening to  the  discussion yesterday,  it  sounds  to me  as  ifthat's  true  to some extent  around most  of  the  country now.  For any ofyou who have  ever tried either to  pilot a light aircraft  or  sail  asailboat, you know that  trying to  steer with a tail wind is  much moredifficult  and much more  dangerous  than with  a head wind.  And  if  welet  tail  winds build up,  where we  wind up  on  the course  is  moreproblematic.  So,  I think  an  adjustment now is  appropriate.  I wouldcome  down on  the  side of  50  basis points  even though Bill McDonough'sargument about  that being viewed as  a one-time adjustment  followed bythe  "Fed on hold" is  interesting.  The other  side of  that would bethat  25  basis points  would be viewed clearly as  the  first  of  a seriesof  moves.  And if  the market quickly built  in pricing and expectationsof  the next  25  basis point  move, then  the equilibrium rate  would moveat  least  as  much as  our move, implying  de  facto  that we easedconditions relative  to  where  the market  is  if  it's  ahead of  us.  Idon't know what  the  timing might be  as  to market  expectations,  but  ifit's  a fairly short  horizon--maybe no  further  out than  the  next FOMCmeeting--we may find that  25  was not  enough to  restrain reserve  growthand  that we would have been better going  50,  or will need  to give  themthe  other 25  fairly quickly.  I would also  support Tom Melzer'ssuggestion about references  to  reserves  and narrow money measures  ascontributing to why we  think a move is  appropriate at  this  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me raise a question.  I thoughtabout  50  basis points,  or  I thought  about it  in the  sense  of  trying tomove  the rate  to where  we want  to put  it  and  then sticking with it.But  I think  it may be very helpful to  have anticipations  in  the marketnow that  we are going  to move rates  higher because  it will  subduespeculation  in the  stock market;  at  this particular stage havingexpectations hanging  in  the market that  we may move  again,  and movereasonably  soon, could have a very useful  effect.  If  it  is  in  any waycontemplated  that we have moved  and are going to stop,  that  couldcreate  the  type of  erosion  in  the economy  that  I've watched over thepast decades,  which is  precisely what we  don't want.  If  we have thecapability of  having a Sword of Damocles  over  the market we canprevent it  from running away.  If  somebody suggested 50  basis pointsand then another  50  and then another  50,  that's  an argument Iunderstand and it's not  inconsistent  with my position.  What  I'm alittle concerned  about  is  that  a number people  might expect thatthat's  in fact what we  are  trying to  do.  If  we're going to  move, Iwould not mind moving again at  the next meeting  or the meeting afterthat,  for  example.  That  depends  on  the evolution of  events,  frankly.In  order  to  simmer down  this process,  I think we should just  verygradually tighten into  it  if  the  evidence suggests  that  that  is wherewe  should be going.  On  the question of whether  it will  become moredifficult  to  tighten,  I presume that  that means  there  are non-monetary-policy reasons  for that,  and  I think  this  Committee has2/3-4/94-48-indicated no  inclination to be affected by  that.  I have no  reason tobelieve we will  be.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Would your preference be  for  25  basis points  andsymmetric  language  or  25  coupled with  asymmetric?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  a good question.  At  this  stage  Iwould tend to  stay with symmetric  if  for  no  other reason than whateverit  is  we do  the  first  time  out,  I think we  send  a very importantmessage.  If  the  economy continues  to  run ahead of  our expectations,  Iwould for  the next  move go  asymmetric.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Well,  just  to  follow up:  My own preference  isalways going  to  be  for  symmetry,  and what  I would like  to  see  donewould be  to do  25  now but with  an  understanding that  there may be  aconference call  if  conditions  seem  to warrant  another  25  even beforethe March meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well,  I don't  think we have  to  have  anunderstanding.  That's  an ongoing  issue  and I wouldn't want  to  implythat  that's not always  the  case because  I think  it  is.  PresidentBoehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  As  far  as  the  economy  goes,  this  is  as  good asit  gets  in terms  of  convincing evidence  to move.  There always  areuncertainties;  there always  are  reasons why we  shouldn't make  achange.  But what  I see  is  a self-feeding  expansion and I thinkcapacity and price pressures  are not  all  that  far away.  So,  as  far asthe  economy goes,  I think we need  to move.  On the  credibility  side,there's  a time  to  talk, a time  for speculation,  and a time  to  act.We've talked, we've had speculation, and I think now is  the time  toact.I came  into  this meeting  somewhat undecided between a 1/2  anda 1/4 point rate  increase.  I think there  are  some  good reasons  for a1/2 point move.  It  is  more  difficult  to tighten  than  to  ease, atleast  it  has been historically.  So  there  is  an  advantage  to  gettingthe job done with fewer moves  rather than more.  Historically, thereis  also  the  tendency to get  behind  the curve rather  than stay ahead ofit.  And I think a larger move  does  compensate  for  that risk.  On  theother hand, I do  think that  a 1/2 point  move may be just  too  strong atthis  point.  There  is  a risk  that we  could appear too  eager.  I'veseen  this Committee  operate  in  the  1970s;  I've  seen  it  operate  in  the1980s  and the  1990s;  frankly, my confidence  in  our willingness andability  to move promptly, to  move as  needed,  is high  enough that  Ithink  that  a 1/4  point move makes  sense.  I also buy the  notion thatit  is  important  for  the market  to anticipate  further moves.  I thinkwe need to be  forthcoming when that  is  called  for.  So,  while historyand the  risks do weigh heavily  on my mind, on balance  I come  out  infavor of  a 1/4  point move and I support  the  symmetrical  directive.  Ithink we  really need full  Committee  support  on this  action;  and toreiterate my point  of yesterday, I think we  ought to make  thisannouncement  sometime before Joan Lovett would normally go  into  the

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.2/3-4/94-49-

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I certainly  think that  the  timehas  come  to move and  that we need  to  take  action today.  If  we  don'tmove, we would put  our credibility seriously at  risk because  there'sno question really that we need to move.  If  we  don't,  I think we willfall way behind the  curve.  In  terms  of  the  amount, my preferencewould be  for  a 1/2 point move.  At  this  stage of  the  game,  given  thesigns  of  strength  in  the  economy and  the evidence  of  some nascentupward price pressures  in at  least  some places  like the purchasingmanagers data,  I worry that  if  we  just  do  a 1/4  point  at  this  junctureit's going to  be seen  as  a rather  timid move.  I think  there's  somerisk that  even  after making that move,  pretty shortly we will  still  bebehind the  curve.  A 1/2  point move,  in contrast,  would be  a decisivemove.  It  would help us  get  out  in  front  of  this  thing as  it  developsand would strengthen our position.  And I guess  I have a littledifficulty understanding  the argument  that  that's  going to  create anexpectation  that we  are not going  to move again  for  some  time.  Ibelieve  those  expectations  would be  determined by unfolding events.Also,  it's worth noting that  if  we were to move  the  funds  rate  to3-1/2  percent  on  a nominal basis,  the  real  funds  rate would  still bequite low and one  could still  make an argument that policy even  thenwould be quite accommodative.  So,  I think the  case  for  a 1/2  pointincrease  is  not  a weak one,  and that  would be  my preference,  althoughI could accept  the 1/4  point  increase.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman,  this  decision is  not  altogetherclear-cut  in my mind.  As  a matter  of  fact,  I view it  as  a difficultlittle,  and that argument would revolve  around the  uncertainty in  theeconomy.  We  certainly had a demand surge in  the  fourth quarter and  itwould appear that  that  is  going  to  continue  to  some extent.  However,there  is  always  the  question before us  as  to  whether  that  level  ofactivity is  going  to  continue.  And I think  the uncertainty isengendered by the  income/debt ratios  that we  see,  the uncertaintiessurrounding  the  economies  of  our  trading partners,  the question  ofwhether  capacity utilization rates  given global competition  are  asmeaningful  as  they were,  and the possible effects of  fiscal  policy--including  the uncertainty  surrounding the health plan which  could beannounced, I suppose,  before our next meeting.  So,  I think all  ofthose things do present the  case  for  staying where we  are  for themoment and waiting.  I just want  to make  sure  that we  don't  lose  sightof  those  arguments.  But  I did indicate  that  it's  a close  call  in myown mind, and on balance  I think  the arguments are more persuasive  onthe  other  side by some marginal degree.  So  I would support  moving atthis meeting.  The credibility of  the  central bank  is  a very, veryimportant element at  this time,  and  I think we will  gain credibilityby moving now even  though there  might be  some marginal  risk  that wemight have to  reverse  course.  Clearly, there  are  signs  that  inflationis  heating up a little,  and we have to  be vigilant about  that.  So,  Iwould support your recommendation.  I would go  for  25 basis pointsbecause  I think the  gradual approach is  better at  this  point,  and Iwould support a symmetric  directive.On  the question of  inflation,  I would just put  something onthe  table, not  for discussion now but as  something  that perhaps weought  to  think about.  And that  is  that  I, for one,  am not  reallyclear what our  objective  is  with respect  to  inflation.  We talk about2/3-4/94-50-price stability and  lower  inflation and  inflation being quiescent  andso  on, but  I don't know what our  level  of  tolerance  is,  what we  findacceptable  as  a Committee  for  inflation.  Now,  I know we  don't want  todesignate  a point reference  of  2.6  percent  or  something like  that,  butI wonder  if  perhaps we  ought  not at  some point  think about  and havesome  discussion about  where we really want  to  be  in  terms  ofinflation.  Is  it  zero  or  is  it  somewhere between  2 and 3 percent  orexactly what  are we aiming  for?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And which price  index are we  using, thatsort  of  thing.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  And over  what  time period.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I throw that  out  as a suggestion  for  theCommittee  to  think  about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I agree  it's certainly  the  time  to  move.  Ihave three  thoughts on why I would prefer a move of  1/2 point  over  1/4point.  First,  the  staff  in yesterday's  presentation said  that  tomaintain not  price stability but  constant  inflation we have  to  raiseinterest rates  150  basis  points by mid-1995.  We have to make  a choiceas  to whether we want  to move  six  times  in the next  year and a half  orthree times.  My answer  is  that  I have  a strong preference  for  threetimes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Suppose  they are wrong?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Well,  if  anything, I think the  risks  are  thatwe  are  going to  have do more than  150  basis points  to  lower  the  levelof  inflation.  I think the bias  of  the  Committee  is  that  if  possiblewe  want  to  bring inflation  down a little more.  Furthermore, the  staffnoted today  that  GDP momentum seems  stronger than  they thought whenthey came  up  with the  150  basis point  estimate.  So,  based on whatwe've learned since  they did their  forecast,  it  seems  that  the  risksare  on the  up side,  and that would  suggest  even more actions  totighten.  I appreciated very much  Bill McDonough's  analysis  of  the"Fed on hold" versus  the  first  in  a series  of  moves.  If  I think aboutit  this way, though, what we  are out  to  do  is  to minimize  the  effecton  long-term growth,  for  a given amount  of disinflation.  If we  go a1/4  point, we are  telling the  markets  that  this  is  the  first  in aseries  and we're going to  be raising rates over  a long period of  time.That would  seem to me  to be a signal  that  over an  extended period oftime  the average  short-term rate  is  going to be higher  than  it  wouldbe  if we did it  quickly.  And since what  affects  long-term growth isequity prices  and long-term bond prices, a slow  gradual move--becauseit  means on  average higher  long-term  rates  for  a longer period--wouldbe more damaging to growth.  So  that would be another  reason, I think,to move  suddenly.Finally, I don't  have  any personal memories of  it  although Iwas alive  at  the time,  the most  successful Fed move against  inflation,as  I recall  from what  I read of  history, was back in 1966.  At  firstthe  data  showed a recession  then, but  that  recession was revised away.2/3-4/94-51-The  Fed was  able to  overcome an  inflationary condition by a short,sudden rise  in interest rates.  The downturn was actually not  adownturn but  simply  a slowing in  the  rate of  growth that  lasted  atmost six months  and  it  brought  the  country another  two years of  highrates  of  economic  expansion.  I think  the  1966  model  is  really what wewant to  emulate  today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  just  interject.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  You want  to  correct  my sense  of  history?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The history was  that  the Fed  took  the  10percent surcharge  as  fiscal  deflation and  didn't act.  The Fed waswrong and had to act  more rapidly  in order to  offset  that,  so  I  thinkthat  was not  a period when the  Fed excelled  in policymaking.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But the  10  percent  surcharge wasn't  enacteduntil  1968  and didn't  take  full  effect  until  1969.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes,  but  there was  the  expectation  thatthere would be  fiscal  drag, and I  think the Fed responded  to  that.That's not  a major issue;  I don't  want  to  prolong  the discussion but  Ihappened to  be  reading about  that  episode recently.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Okay.  In any case,  if  we have  to do  150  basispoints  or more,  I think  the  greatest  "bang for  the buck,"  with minimumharm to  long-term growth, would be  to move  50  basis points  today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think yesterday's  discussion andthis morning's  indicate  that we  really need to  take  action now.  Asfor  the amount,  there  is  an  economic  case for doing  50  basis pointsnow and  I think it would in  the  longer  term give us  a more  stableenvironment.  Bill McDonough's  arguments  are valid to  some  extent  interms of  what kinds  of  reaction we  would get, but  I think  those  wouldtake  care of  themselves and we would really be better  off with  50basis points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I agree with  all  the  comments  that  have been madeabout  it  being the  appropriate time  to move, and I won't  go  throughthe  rationale  for that.  On the question  of magnitude, I have a mildpreference  for  a  50  basis point move  basically on  the grounds  that  Ibelieve short-term interest rates  have to  move pro-cyclically.  A  1/4point  increase  at  this  point  just  doesn't seem  to me  to  be an actionof  much magnitude at all.  My guess  is  not  that  it  would get  lost  inthe markets--that  certainly won't  happen--but that  it's  not going  toturn  out  to be  significant relative  to  the  job ahead  of  us.  And ifI'm  right that  short-term rates have  to  move pro-cyclically, it  seemsto me  that  we ought  to  get  started.  Therefore,  as  I said,  I wouldhave  a mild preference  for a 50  basis  point move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I too would  favor  tightening atthis  point  for  the reasons  that have  been mentioned.  I might note2/3-4/94-52-that  I found your  discussion of  inventories  quite  interesting.Yesterday, I characterized our  forecast  as  being very similar  to  thatof  the Greenbook.  One difference  is  that we have somewhat  greaterstrength in the  early part  of  the period  largely as a result  of muchhigher nonfarm inventories  than  assumed in  the Greenbook forecast.With regard to  the  amount of  our move,  I do  favor  50  basis points.  Ithink  it's  the  appropriate move for  some of  the  reasons  that have  beenmentioned.  I'm not  in  favor  of  25  basis  points.  But  if  one wanted 25basis points,  communicating as  best we  can that  other increases  arecoming, I think  that would  drive one  to  asymmetry.  It  seems  to methat  25  basis  points and  symmetry just  doesn't  represent what most  ofus  think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Syron.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  To  start  out,  I guess  I disagree with Bob Parry.I came  into  this meeting  thinking that we  should do  something.  As  Iread expectations and where things  are,  I would have  thought  that  25basis points  would not be  seen by  the market  as  something that waslacking in  courage  or  testosterone on  our part.  I want  to make  someother observations, but  could I ask  a question of  Joan just  as we  arein  this  comment process?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sure.

[SECTION]

MR.  SYRON.  And the  question is,  Joan:  What  do you think theexpectations  in  the market will  be if  we are  to  do  something?  What  doyou think  the  market reaction would be  to  25  basis points  as  comparedto  50  if  either were  announced about an hour  from now?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  When  the market was anticipating  the move,  Ithink most  of the  expectations were  for  25  basis  points.  Some  of  thatgot built  into  the rate  structure yesterday;  I think by  the  time  theday was  over about  80  percent reflected  that a 1/4  point move mightoccur today.  This morning's  numbers  on  the January employmentsituation may have moved some  of  that pricing  back out  of  the market.So,  certainly a move  of  50  basis points would have  to be  reflected inthe market.  Since  25  basis points  is  not  fully in  there  now, the  next25  basis  points would clearly result  in  some rate back up;  rates  wouldhave  to adjust much more  than they have.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Well,  let  me just  continue.  I think policy hasbeen stimulative but  I don't  think it  has  been inappropriatelystimulative.  I don't want  to  argue about  a month or  five  or six weeksone way or  the other, but we  went through a period  in which we neededto  do  something.  What we all want  to  do very clearly  is  to maximizelong-term growth  in  the economy, controlling  real  growth.  As  LarryLindsey said,  controlling prices  is  a mechanism  for doing that.  Butthe  reason we're concerned about prices  is  that we care  about  long-term real  growth, not for  some abstract  reason.  While  there's nolong-term  tradeoff, in  the short  term the way things work--at least  inmy model--is  that we  can't  avoid some lost  output  at  the edges;  andwhat we're  trying  to  do  is  minimize that  interval  of  lost  output  overtime.  I'd be cautious  about doing 50  basis points  because  I'm notsure that  we have to  raise  rates  150  basis  points.  And at  this  pointI wouldn't want to  start  down a path with fairly  fixed notions  ofwhere I'm going at  the  end of  it  in terms  of  rates or  in  terms  ofmonetary policy.  I have a notion of  where  I want  to  get  in  terms of2/3-4/94-53-the  economy, but not necessarily on what we need  to  do  to  get there.I think policy over  time  has been pretty effective.  We're alreadywhat  I might  call  orally asymmetric  in  a sense,  given what  theChairman did rather  effectively  in his  testimony.  I would stronglysuggest doing 25  basis points now with  this  accompanying change  inprocess.  And don't  forget  this will  have a big  announcement effectboth  in  the way it  is  done  and the  fact  that we haven't  done  anythingin  17  months and we haven't  tightened in  60  months.  I would alsosuggest  that  it's not  terribly long until  the  Humphrey-Hawkins hearingand there's  going to be plenty of  opportunity to  be  orally asymmetric,if  I may use  that  phrase  again, or  to  indicate how we  see  things.  So,I think going  50  basis points would be depreciating a little  too  muchthe  opportunity we're  going to  have  to  put this  in  context and may notbe  fully taking  into consideration  the announcement  effect  of  doing  25basis points and announcing it  after this  long  a period of policyinaction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well,  I've  been  around a long timewatching markets behave  and I will  tell you  that  if  we  do  50  basispoints  today, we have  a very high probability of  cracking theseeasier  for us  to  start  the process with a smaller move.  And, as  DickSyron says,  there's  a very large  announcement  effect.  Having stuckwith an unchanged policy  for  so  long,  it  is  going  to be  far  easier  forus  to  get on  an accelerated path  if we need to  at  a later  time.  To  gomore  than 25  at  this point  I think would be a bad mistake.  It  couldgenerate surprising  counterproductive  responses  in  this  market.Strangely, it  is  far  easier  to  do  50  basis points  in  the  second move,not  in  the  first  move.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That's right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  is  a very big move, not because  ofthe magnitude but because  of the  announcement  effect,  as  Dick Syronpoints  out.  I would feel  very uncomfortable if  we  tried to  do more atthis  stage.  I think it's  the wrong pattern and  I must  say it wouldmake me really uncomfortable.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Could  I make a comment?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Certainly.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I very much share  the view that  theeffect  of  a 50 basis point move  today  in the marketplace  is  highlyunpredictable.  It's  sufficiently likely to be  damaging in crackingthe  markets that  I think it's  a step we  should not take.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Look, the  stock market  is  at  an  elevatedlevel  at  this  stage by any measure we  know of.  We  could set off  asequence of  events  here that  I think could make the policy path  thatwe have been developing here a difficult  one.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Well,  I do have  a preference to  tighten 1/2point  immediately.  It's probably too  strong to  say that  a 1/4  pointmove  is  following the  market but  a good deal  of  that  is  already builtinto  the market.  I do  think that  because of  the  cyclical  influences a1/4  point move won't have  as much effect.  I don't  see  anything on  thehorizon that would warrant an asymmetric  directive.  Now, having said2/3-4/94-54-that,  I will  say that  I can live with a 1/4  point  on the  "Fed on  hold"theory and the  expectation of  more  to  come.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman, I'm  in the  camp  that prefers  25basis points.  I am not  sure  whether we  are early  or  just  right  orlate;  I don't  know how history is  going  to  judge  that.  But  I amreasonably confident  that we're not  seriously late  and that  conditionsare not  in  the process  of  running away  from us  on  the up  side.  I justdon't  see  the  economy as  overheated now.  I see  it  as  in  the  processof  approaching  full  employment  but  still  with some  meaningful  softspots.  President  Parry among others  mentioned some  important placeswhere that's  still  evident  in  the economy.  I just  don't  think we needa strong shock.  What  we need is  a new policy momentum.  We have beenin a momentum of  rest  for  a long time;  I think we need to  change thatand now is  the  time to  do  it.  But  I believe the  25  basis points wouldestablish  that;  it  would put a new framework in the  marketplace and anew orientation  to policy.  In my view  that's what  is  needed at  thispoint rather than  a more  serious  move than  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I certainly buy the  fact  that  this  is  the timeto make a change  in policy  toward more  constraint.  But  I really favorthe  50  basis point move  at  this  point,  and I respectfully disagreewith the assessment  that  such  a move would crack the markets.  I thinkthe markets  have already discounted a 25 basis point move and  arestill  burning away at  a great  rate.  I would like  to  see a strongermove  than 25  basis points  simply to  damp  down without a crash  thestock market particularly.  I think it  is  getting  increasinglydangerous because  of  the way it  has been running.  I believe  a 50basis point move will  send an unmistakable message  that will  damp  thisenthusiasm  in  the  stock market  without  causing it  to  crash.  If  itsuccessfully  scotches  the  inflationary  expectations  that may be partof  the  structure  of  long-term rates,  that  may have  a very salubriouseffect  in bringing down  long-term rates,  and I don't  think 25  basispoints  will  do that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly favor moving and,  likeothers,  I have  debated in my own mind  the difference between a move of25  and 50  basis  points.  I was  impressed with the  tone  of  the  commentsyesterday.  It  does  seem to me  that there  has been a very significantshift  toward strength  in  the  reports  that we heard yesterday ascontrasted with December.  But despite  all  that,  I must  say that  someuncertainties  still  remain.  Things  are  looking awfully good but  thereare some questions  that we've all  talked about  that  still need to beanswered.  So,  I come  down  favoring 25  basis points.  It  does  seem tome  that  25  basis points with  this  announcement--which may turn  out  tobe precedential but at  least  this  morning would be unprecedented--willhave  a very strong signal  effect.  Therefore,  I think in  effect wewill  get more  than  25  basis points  out  of  the  action  that wecontemplate.  With regard  to  symmetry versus asymmetry--and this  is  adifferent  thought--I've come  to  the  conclusion  that  we  ought  to  getrid of  the  asymmetric  language  forever.  It  seems  to me to  cause  farmore  complications  than it's  worth.  If  we  are going  to move,2/3-4/94-55-particularly over  the foreseeable  future,  I think we ought  to  do  it  asa result  of  a conference call where we  are all  participating asopposed to getting  all  wrapped up in  asymmetric  language.  So,  I wouldstrongly favor symmetry now on a continuous  basis.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  To me  the  question remains:  If  you're  going tocut  off  the cat's  tail,  what  is  the optimum number of  snips?  Normallythe  answer to  that  is  one.  In  a policy  context,  I think  thattranslates  to  the  50  basis  points,  but  I could certainly live withyour recommendation of  25  basis  points plus  the  announcement effect.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You know,  I rarely  feel strongly aboutan  issue,  and I very  rarely sort  of  press  this  Committee.  But  let metell you  something about what's  gnawing at  me here.  I am verysympathetic with the view that we've got  to  move  and that we're  goingto have  an  extended period of moves,  assuming the  changes  that  aregoing on now continue  in the  direction  of  strength.  It  is  veryunlikely that  the recent rate  of  economic growth will not  simmer downlargely because  some developments  involved in  this  particular periodare  clearly  one-shot  factors--namely, the very dramatic increase inresidential  construction  and the  big increase  in motor vehicle  sales.Essentially the  two  of  those have  added one-shot  elements  to  growth.In  the  context  of  a saving rate  that  is  not high,  the probability isin the  direction of  this  expansion slowing  from its  recent pace, whichat the moment  is well  over 4 percent  and, adjusting  for weathereffects,  may be  running  over  5 percent.  This  is  not  sustainablegrowth, and it  has nothing  to  do with monetary policy.  In  otherwords,  it  will  come  down.  And the  way a 3 percent  growth  feels,  if  Ifeels now.I would be  very concerned  if  this  Committee went  50  basispoints now because  I don't think  the  markets expect  it.  You want  tohit a market when it needs  to be  hit;  there  is  no  significant  evidenceat  this  stage  of  imbalances  that  require the  type  of  action that  anumber of  us  have discussed.  Were we  to  go  the  50  basis points withthe  announcement effect and  the  shock effect,  I am  telling you  thatthese markets will  not hold  still.  I've been in  the  economicforecasting business  since  1948,  and I've  been on Wall Street  since1948,  and  I am telling you I have  a pain in  the pit  of my  stomach,which in  the past  I've been very successful  in alluding to.  I amtelling you--and I've  seen  these markets--this  is  not  the  time  to dothis.  I think there will be a time;  and if  the  staff's  forecast  isright, we  can get  to  150 basis points pretty easily.  We  can do  itwith  a couple  of  1/2  point  jumps  later when  the markets  are  in  theposition to  know what we're doing and there's continuity.  I reallyrequest  that we not  do  this.  I do request  that we be willing to moveagain  fairly soon,  and maybe in  larger increments;  that depends  on howthings  are  evolving.I also would be  concerned  if  this Committee were not  inconcert because at  this  stage we  as  a Committee are  going to have  todo  things which  the rest  of  the  world is  not  going to  like.  We haveto  do  them because  that's  our job.  If  we  are perceived to be  split  onan  issue as  significant as  this,  I think we're  risking some veryserious problems for this  organization.  I don't  think there  is  a2/3-4/94-56-philosophical  difference  anywhere  around this  room.  If  somebody askedme  if  I think there  is  an economic  case  for 50  basis points, my answeris  "most certainly there  is  a case."  Do  I think  there is  a  case  inthe  full  context  of  where the  financial  markets  are at  this  stage andwhat  the  expectations  in the markets  are at  this  stage?  I would  sayemphatically  "no."  It's  far  too risky.  We don't  need to  take  thoserisks.  If  I could see  a very  significant  benefit  from doing 50  basispoints,  I would  say let's  do  it;  I just  don't  see  it.  Bob.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, you  certainly made  your points  verystrongly and  they are points  that  one wants  to  take  into  account.  Ithink the  concern  of  some who  are  favoring  50  basis  points may berelated to  the  long  time between now and  the next meeting.  Is  itpossible, as  something of  a compromise,  that  we could have anagreement  to  have  a  telephone meeting at  some  intermediate pointbetween the  two  meetings  to  see  if  things have changed to any extent?We  certainly would have  the benefit of  seeing  the market  reaction tothis  25  basis point  move.  In  addition to  that,  we'd have  some moreinformation on  the  economy, particularly  the  inventory  side,  and maybewe  could discuss  these  developments again.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  perfectly fine with me.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman,  if  we could make  it  specific,  Iwould recommend that  we  do  25  basis points  today  and have a conferencecall  within  two  days  after your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Upon what  evidence?

[SECTION]

MR.  SYRON.  May  I ask  a procedural  question?  I favor Bob'ssuggestion.  I would be  a  little  concerned about  setting a precisedate  just  because  we're  in  this  process  of  change.  The  announcement,for  example,  is  a change  and  these are  all  things  that we will  openlydiscuss  later  on.  I think we  have to  be  careful  that what we'reannouncing today is--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me put  it  this  way.  I've  beenChairman of  this  Committee now  for  over  six years.  I hope  I haveenough  credibility to  know when a  telephone call  is  appropriate.  I'mwatching the  same  developments  that  you  are.  I'd  just  as  soon not  seta date.  It  may turn out  that  way, Larry,  but I don't--

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  But  there will  be a phone call?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  I wouldn't put  a  fixed date.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I would very strongly prefer  thatwe not  set a precedent  that  the Chairman, particularly this  Chairman,has  to agree  in  advance  on the need for  a phone  call.  His  record  isthat  he's  going  to  call  us  if  there's  something  to  talk about  or  if afew of  us  call  him and say we  think there's  something to  talk aboutand  request  a  telephone  conference.  I think  it's  demeaning to  theprocess,  to  the  nature  of  this  Committee,  to  say  to  the Chairman,"I'll vote  for what you want but  we've  got  to have  a phone call."  Ireally think  that's  a  terrible precedent  to set.2/3-4/94-57-

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  I agree with  that.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  I agree with that and  I also agree  with that  fromanother perspective.  In  being fully  open  and honest, which we  shouldbe,  in what we discuss when we  release the  minutes  for  this meeting,we  don't want half  a picture  conveyed.  We don't want  to  say  thatthere  has been a dramatic  change in process  and that we went  alongwith  this policy but  it  was with a contingency--that  it was  really anod and  a wink.  It's  fine  if  there's  a call,  but  it  has  to be  on yourvolition without  essentially a nod and a wink agreement  that,  yes,we'll  do  this  but with  a strong presumption  that  we'll do  another  25basis  points  in  a call.  I think that  would be  wrong.  I think  itstill  has  to be  an  open  issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  I think Bob is  saying precisely thesame  thing.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I'm willing  to  defer  to  your judgment  on  thepoints  really would be  the  correct move  except  for  constraints  of  theconcerns  about market  reaction we would come  in with the  secondinstallment  fairly promptly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'm of  the belief  that if  this  economybehaves  as  strongly as  it  has been behaving recently, it means  thatour  forecast  is wrong  and that more  is  required rather than  less.  Ithink it's  too  soon  to  make that  judgment.  But  if  this  economycontinues  to move, especially  if  the  inventory issue which  I raisedbegins  to  show its  head, I would be  strongly supportive  of  much morerapid and, frankly, larger moves.Let  me make  the  suggestion then  that we move  25  basis pointswith symmetry,  that we watch  this process very  closely, and that  ifevidence  suggests  that  this  situation  is  not  simmering  down,  that wehave a telephone  conference at  the  appropriate  time.  At that point  wecan  decide to  do nothing, move  further,  or  suggest  another telephoneconference;  we  can do  a number  of  things.  But  it would effectively  bea continuation of  this meeting.  So,  I would request  that.  I don'trequest  often that  we  try to  stay together.  That's not what  isrequired here.  I think we're all  very much on  the  same  focus.  It'snot  as  though some  of  us  think we  shouldn't do  anything,  some  think weshould ease,  and  some  think we  should  tighten.  We've had thoseoccasions  in the  past and  that's  a legitimate difference  reflected  inthe nature  of  the  Committee  itself.  As  I listened these  last  twodays,  I didn't  sense any significant  difference within  the  Committeeon the  purpose and the  goals  of what  we're doing.  I would requestthat,  if  we  can, we  act unanimously.  It  is  a very potent message outin  the  various communities  with which we  deal  if  we stand  together.If we  are going to  get  a split  in the  vote, I think it  will  create aproblem  for us,  and I don't know how it  will play out.  I rarely askthis,  as  you know.  This  is  one  of  the  times  when we really aretogether  and  I'd hate to  have  our vote  somehow imply something otherthan  the  agreement  for  a tightening move  that  in  fact  exists  in  thisCommittee.  With that  I would  ask--I'm sorry, Governor Lindsey, didyou want  to  say something?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  You  answered my question.2/3-4/94-58-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With  that  I would  request  that you  reada symmetrical directive  with a somewhat  tighter--

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I'll be  reading from  the Bluebook on page  24:"In  the  implementation of  policy for the  immediate  future,  theCommittee  seeks  to  increase somewhat..."

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I would say  "slightly,"  Norm.

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I will  be  referring  to page 8 in  the  Bluebook inthe  course of  my report.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  As  I understand it,  we  have basicallytwo ways  of  looking  at  the monetary aggregates.  Either we're going  tolook at  them and make them usable  and useful  in policy determinationor  we are not.  If  they come back into vogue and they are working,what we  want  is  a range  that  is  consistent with price  stability.  As  Iunderstand it,  that's  1 to  5 percent  for M2,  if  it's  working.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right,  assuming a  flat  velocity.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The monetary aggregates  could come back in a  senseof  predictable velocities.  In  fact, we haven't  done  that poor a  jobof  predicting  them in recent years,  but we believe  it's  not  a  stablesituation.  But  you're  right;  if  the M2  velocity  comes back  to  its2/3-4/94-60-flat path, the  1 to  5 percent  range would be  approximately the  rightrange.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  that's  the right  one,  then thequestion  is  what do we do  in  the interim?  We  have a choice  of makingthem  lower,  in which case  we're basically saying  that M2  doesn'tmatter.  As  Paul  Sarbanes  said, we've  shot  the bullet  and  then drawnthe  circle  around  the bullet  hole.  If  M2  starts  coming back and wehave  a  0 to  4 percent  range,  do  we want  then  to  raise  the range  to  aprice  stability range?  It  raises  an  interesting  game  theory questionhere.  I'm almost  inclined to  say we  ought  to  leave  it  where  it  is,and  if  it's  not working it's  irrelevant,  and  if  it  starts  to  work weare  where we  want  to be.

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  Why  lower  it  and have to  raise  it?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I  think raising  it  gives  the wrongsignal.  We've been  trying  to  get  the M2  range to  price  stability, andwe  finally got  it  here.  It  may be true  that  M2  isn't  working, but  therange  is  working!  [Laughter]  And if  M2  comes  back, we  actually willnot  be pressured to  move on  it.  Anyway,  that  was  supposed  to be  aquestion!

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Mr.  Chairman, a possible  answer may be  that whenwe made some  of  those recent  adjustments,  we  did  emphasize  theirtechnical nature  in  response  to  some  recent  developments  in  thebehavior  of  the  aggregates,  so  there  might be  some  feedback.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  but  I have  this  technical problemwhere  if  it's  technical  we're not  using it,  and if  it  works we want  itto  be  right.  And to make  it  right  by raising it,  I find difficult.Governor  Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr.  Chairman, I agree  with you  completely on  a1 to  5 percent  range  for  exactly the  reason you  gave.  My question  ison debt,  however.  If  you  look at  Chart  4,  the world was  lovely untilabout  1981  or  1982,  then  it  fell  out  of bed.  And unlike  M3  and therest  of  them,  it  didn't  even change  course.  It  looks  as  if  during  the1980s  we moved to  a new secular plateau.  We know what  happened duringthat  period:  There  was  corporate restructuring  in  favor  of  debt  forlots  of  reasons;  there were  lots  of  learned papers  to  explain  thatdevelopment.  Similarly, households  moved toward debt.  Not only havethose  trends  stopped in  the  corporate sector, but  they are nowreversing themselves.  Equity is  now being issued to  replace debt.Wouldn't  it be  reasonable  to  expect  that,  if  anything, the velocity ofdebt would accelerate  in the  years ahead largely as  a result  ofresponses  in  the  corporate  sector?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think it's  a balancing of  a  couple  of  thingshere--the  federal  government  versus  the private  sector.  The private-sector  debt  growth as you know was very  low and total  debt growthactually was  close to  GDP,  as you can see  by the  flatness  of  thatline,  largely because  the  federal  government was  such a heavyborrower.  Now, federal  government  borrowing is  being cut back but  webelieve  the private debt  growth will  be picking up  a bit;  in  fact,  itdid over  the  second half  of  last year.  The projection  for 1994  isbasically that  the pattern  of  the  second half  in  terms  of  householdand business borrowing--there  are  tradeoffs between  the  two but  taken2/3-4/94-61-together the  total--will  be about  the  same  as  it was  in  the  secondhalf  of  last year.  We're not  predicting an acceleration of  that.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  You are  basically predicting an  elasticity ofone  with respect  to nominal  GDP and debt  spending.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Although I think that's  what works  out  of  acomplicated underpinning in which we  say,  as  Mike pointed outyesterday, there will  be more  corporate  use  of external  funds  over  thecoming year or two because  their  cash flow  is  slowing relative  totheir spending.  Household borrowing growth, on  the  other hand, isexpected to  slow a little.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  there has been a secular change  in  therelative  costs  of  debt and equity in  the  corporate sector.  They arevoting with their  feet  now and issuing new equity, particularly  IPOsand what have you.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  You  could greatly overstate  these  trends.  We aretalking about  $20  to  $25  billion a year  of  net  equity  issuance, whichis  a very small  part  of  the  overall  external  financing  activity in theeconomy.  So  that  isn't  a major  element  of  the  financial  flows  at  thispoint.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  In  the  takeover of  Paramount, what  I findstriking about  the  composition  of  that  offer  is  how heavily equityoriented it  is  compared to offers  five  and six and seven years  ago.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  But  it's  less  so  than a lot  of  the othertransactions.  In  fact,  that  one includes  some  cash, whereas most  ofthe major transactions have  just  been stock or  stock swaps.  So,indeed in our  forecast we're assuming we're  going to  see  some  trickleof  cash buyout  transactions  over  the  coming years because  our  sense  isthat  the  firms probably have gone  a long way  in adjusting  theirbalance  sheets  and trying  to  get  the mix that  they will be  comfortablewith.  Our tax system, with an  increase  in corporate  income  tax rates,tilts  even more  in the  direction of  favoring debt  than  it  did a yearago.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Well,  I don't know if  I would make  thatconclusion  for  the  aggregate effect  of  the taxes.  I might argue  theother way.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Well,  okay,  I was  just  looking at  the  marginaltaxes.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But while  I agree with the  alternative I M2  andM3  target ranges,  I prefer alternative  II  on  debt.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I have  a question.  I'm probably the  next  to  theoldest person in  this  room  and I remember Ml.  The precipitous  declinein M1  growth  shown on  page 13  puzzles me.  What's  the  rationale  or  thereasoning behind  that?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Going from  1993  to  1994,  we have  two  specialfactors.  One  is  the mortgage-backed securities  situation, which  added2/3-4/94-62-whicha couple percentage points to  M1  in  1993  and will  subtract a little  in1994.  We  are assuming  that  the  refinancings of  mortgages will  settledown or  actually decline, and  they have, and that  subtracts  fromdemand deposits.  Number  two  is shifted a bunch of  deposits,  about  $7 billion or  so--we're not quitesure how much yet  but  in  that  order of  magnitude--from NOW accounts  toMMDAs.  It  doesn't  affect M2,  but we  think  that  subtracted about  3/4of  a percentage point  from M1  growth.  For M1  growth, when you go  from1994  to  1995  the principal  effect  is  interest  rates.  We've assumedthat  the  short-term interest rates  consistent  with the  Greenbookforecast  start  on an upward  trend in  the  second half of  1994  andcontinue  that way through 1995.  One  thing we  have  found about M1  isthat  it  is  a very interest-sensitive  aggregate.  There's  the  issue  ofcompensating balances  and  the  earnings effects,  but  even more  so,  Ithink, there's  the  issue  of  NOW accounts.  When time deposit  rates  orrates,  some  of  the  funds  that  had been shifted  into NOW accounts--because  rates  on NOW accounts  and small  time  deposits were about  thesame  or not  much different--may well be  shifted back to  time  deposits.So, we  think  the NOW accounts  in particular have become  extremelyinterest  sensitive.  And that's  why you  see  the  velocity of  M1--onChart  5--has become  highly variable,  especially after 1980.  It'sbecause  of  the  interest  rate  effects.  Primarily what's happening,going  from 1994  to  1995  in  particular,  is  the effects  of  the  risinginterest rates.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  So,  the  major effect  is  in  the demand depositssegment  of Ml?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Demand deposits but  the NOW accounts as  well.  Wethink  that  rising interest  rates  will pull  funds  out of  the NOWaccounts  into  small  time deposits which would have,  obviously, noeffect per  se  on M2  but  would have  a major  effect on M1.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  What  is  the underlying assumption about  thespread between a NOW account rate  and a CD rate?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We would assume  that  that  spread would widen.  Ourexperience  is  that  the NOW account  rates adjust very slowly andsluggishly whereas  the  small  time deposit  rates  in  recent years havecome  to  adjust  fairly rapidly.  We would think  that  the  retail  CD ratewould rise  with a lag  but  fairly promptly as  the  fed  funds rate  roseand other market  interest rates  adjusted higher, but that  the  NOWaccount  rate would be  quite  sluggish.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  A couple  of questions, Don,  about your  table  onprojections,  but  the  first question relates  to  the  Chairman's  remarksabout  the ranges.  As  I understand your M2  projection in  the  outeryears,  under all  three  of  these alternatives M2  is  in the  upper, upperhalf of  all  of  them,  even  the  1 to  5 percent.  That would assume thatif  we went  to your  alternative  II,  0 to  4 percent  for M2, we would atsome  point have  to  raise  the  range  if  the idea was  to have  the rangecenter  around what  we would wind up with in equilibrium.2/3-4/94-63-

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes, although  I think the baseline  is  a littletoward  the  upper  end,  but  we  are  assuming  that  these  special  trends  invelocity do  come  to  an end.  We do have  some declines  in  short-termrates  in  1996  and  1997  in the  tighter  and  easier alternatives, whichpush up money growth  a  little.  We have  long-term rates  coming down  sowe  have the  yield curve  flattening.  So,  there  are  a few  specialfactors,  which  are  pushing  up  money  growth  out  there.  But  theunderlying assumption  is  consistent  with what  the  Chairman said,  thatis, the yield curve,  in  the  out  years we assumed--without  any evidence  yetthat  it's  happening--that  the big shifts  in money demand did cease.aside  from  those  special  factors  having  to  do  with  the  shape  ofMR. 

[SECTION]

JORDAN.  When  I look  at  your  nominal  GDP  projections  andthe  M2  out  at  the  end  of  your  projection,  I  notice  your  velocities  arezero  for  all  three.  It's  the  constraints  that you  impose;  you'veassumed that  by that  point--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes.  When the  interest rate  effects  die  down  in1998  and 1999,  we  have assumed  that velocity growth will  be  zero  asyou  said, that  the  special  shifts will--

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.  It  struck me,  when  I looked at  the  topand the  bottom of  the  federal  funds rate  projections for  the  out yearsand  the  top  CPI  projections,  that  you  have  under  all alternatives  either  4  or  4-1/2  on  the  funds  rate.  That  means  thefunds rate--I  don't  like  the words tighter  and easier  so  I won't  usethem--on  the  less  inflationary path is  above  the  inflation  rate.three

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  And even substantially above  the  nominal GNP.In  Street  jargon,  policy  is  becoming  relatively  more  restrictive forward in  that  the  inflation  rate  and inflation  expectations arecoming down more than  the nominal yield  and you're  leaving the  fundsrate  above  nominal  GDP  six  years  out.going

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It's  two  things.  One  is  that we  recognized whenthe  out  years. we  talked about whether  we  should fine-tune this  strategy, inparticular when we  got  out  there,  that  in  fact real  interest  rates  arerising  in  this  tighter  strategy.  We have  the unemployment rate  stillat  7 percent.  I think  that  in  fact  if  the Committee  were to  engage  inthe  tighter  strategy--that  is, raise  rates  higher  now--it  would  end  upreducing  the  funds  rate  in degree of  fine-tuning  that perhaps  wasn't  needed.  But we  recognizedthe  problem  you're  raising,  which  is that  the  real  rate  is  rising  outthere,  and  the  Committee  would  have  to  bring  it  down. isimportant  to  emphasize  that  to  get  the  kind of  disinflation embodiedin  this  scenario and  without  credibility effects--as we pointed  outwe're  just  working  off  short-run  and  long-run  Phillips  curves--you  doneed to keep  the real  interest  rate a bit  above  its  equilibrium levelin inflation rate  pointed down.  So,  it's not  surprising that  the realrate  in  the tighter strategy  is  above  the  real  rate  in  the baseline  orthe real  rate  in  the easier  strategy;  that  corresponds  to  the variousunemployment rates  in  the model which you need to  get  the  inflationrate--tighter  policy  to  keep  slack  in just  seemed  like  athe  economy, to  keep  theI  think  it this It 2/3-4/94-64-

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Well,  there's no doubt  the  lack of credibilityhas  effects  on this.  But  the  last  time we were  running for  asustained period at  2 percent or  less  on  the  CPI--as  in  the periodfrom 1997  through  1999--we had a lot  lower  short-term rates  than youare  suggesting here.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I don't  have any questions  on this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  Any further questions?  If not,would somebody  like to  start  the roundtable  on what you want  to  do?

[SECTION]

MR. SYRON.  I agree with what  I think was  implicitly  theChairman's  suggestion, which  is  that  I would leave  these  ranges  alone.I understand the  point that  Larry raised  on debt,  and  I could goeither way with that.  But my own personal view is  that  it risksputting a little  too  fine a point  on this.  That's  a tactical  issue;it's  not  a substantive  issue.  I think the  comment was  correct,  butgiven our  level  of knowledge on  these  things  and the disruptions  thatwe  are  and have been  subject  to,  I'd be very wary of making  arelatively small  change in  one  of  these  ranges because  I think  itcould imply an  ability to  forecast  and to understand these things  thatis  greater than we have.  I don't know if you want my view now onpresenting a forecast  for  1995,  but  I would have  fairly seriousreservations  about going ahead with  that.  As has  been said, that  isfar  enough out  that  it  certainly  incorporates as  much an  objective  asit  does  a pure forecast.  And I think that  suggests we need to  thinkvery carefully about whether we want to  do  that or not.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Well,  I don't  think we  should change  thetargets  for  the  reasons  that  Dick Syron just went  through.  I agreewith him.  Given the  kinds  of uncertainties we're  facing with M2,especially now,  I do  think that  that  raises a problem.  Not having  anominal  anchor  in  some explicit  way raises a problem for monetarypolicy, but  I don't  think that putting out  the  1995  forecasts wouldsolve  that problem.  It would raise more questions  than  it wouldanswer  about preferences  and tradeoffs  and a lot  of  other  things.  So,I think  that  would be  a bad  idea.  To me the  way to  deal with  thatproblem basically  is  just  to  continue publicly to  communicate  our  firmcommitment to price  stability over  the longer haul, no matter howtired people get  of  listening to us  say that  and how tired we  get  oflistening to  ourselves  say it.  But  that  I think  is  our best  option inthat  sense.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Well,  Mr. Chairman,  I think there  are  so manyuncertainties  at  this point with respect to M2  that we  shouldn'tchange the  range.  And those uncertainties  are magnified by the  factthat  if  we do have  an  increase  in rates, M2  could grow much morequickly, with defections  from asset  funds;  this  effect  could in  factbe heightened if  there is  concern about  the  safety of  these  uninsuredassets.  If  we're confident about  our  current  estimates,  I thinkthere's  enough  scope in  the  current  ranges to  adjust policy  the way wewant  to.  With respect  to  a tighter alternative,  I would find  it very2/3-4/94-65-difficult  to  assume a policy path that  shows  a rise  in unemploymentfrom  the current  level  that  is  basically sustained over  a  five-yearperiod.  So,  I would  favor retaining  the provisional  ranges  that  wehave.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, I think  our current  ranges  areconsistent with our  longer-term objectives  and I would not be  forchanging  them.  In  addition,  I would not  favor using  the  1995projections.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I'd adopt  the provisional  ranges  shown inalternative  I.  And I agree with your logic,  Alan.  I've always  feltthat we  ought  to  get  those  ranges where  they  ought to  be  in  terms  ofsome concept  of  long-term  price stability and  then not move  themaround,  even though they're not useful  right now.  I wouldn't providethe  1995 projections.  My reason has  to  do  with the  fact  that  theyincorporate different  underlying assumptions.  They really are  notcomparable.  People have  made different  assumptions about monetarypolicy in particular.  If we were going  to  do  anything along thoselines,  although I wouldn't  suggest  that we  are ready to,  we'd bebetter off  to  set  a nominal  GDP  target which, of  course,  implies  aninflation  target.  That's  something we might want  to  explore  inconnection with setting provisional ranges  for  1995,  but we'recertainly not  ready to  talk about  it  seriously right now.

I'm reading  from page 23  now in  the  Bluebook.The  first  sentence is  unchanged,  and continuing:  "In  furtherance ofthese objectives,  the  Committee at  this meeting established ranges  forgrowth  of M2  and M3  of  1 to  5 percent  and 0 to  4 percent  respectively,measured from  the  fourth quarter  of  1993  to  the  fourth quarter of1994.  The  Committee anticipated  that  developments  contributing tounusual  velocity increases  could persist  during the  year and  that2/3-4/94-67-money growth within  these  ranges  would be consistent with its  broadpolicy objectives.  The monitoring range  for  growth  in  total domesticnonfinancial  debt  was set  at  4 to  8 percent  for the  year."  Then  at  thebottom of  the page,  "The behavior  of  the  monetary aggregates  willcontinue to  be  evaluated in the  light  of progress  toward price levelstability, movements  in  their velocities, and developments  in  theeconomy and financial  markets.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'd like  to  take a moment before weadjourn to  note  the impending retirement  of  one  of  the  System's  mostdistinguished economists, Dick Davis.  During his 33  years  at  the  NewYork Bank he's  provided important  service not  only to  that  institutionbut  to  the  System  as  a whole.  Repeatedly when  there was  a major  issueregarding monetary policy--for  example,  the  role  of  the  monetaryaggregates  or what  our operating procedures  should be--we  all  lookedto  Dick for  leadership  in our  research  efforts.  Dick has  alwaysexhibited an  extraordinary  ability to blend  sophisticated, technicalanalysis with common  sense  and an  understanding of  institutionalrealities.  In addition, he  has  been a model  for  all  economists  in  theSystem.  We thank you very much  and wish you well  in  your  futureendeavors.  [Applause]
