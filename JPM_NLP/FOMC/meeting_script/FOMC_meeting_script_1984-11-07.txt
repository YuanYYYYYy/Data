MR.  CROSS.  Well,  they  don't  sell  only  on  those  celebratedoccasions  when  they have  come  in  and  hit  the  market,  of  course.  Theydo  put  some  of  this  in  over  time.  For  a long  period  of  time  they  hadfollowed,  in  varying  degrees,  the  practice  of  putting  these  amounts  induring  periods  when  it  seemed  sensible  to  them  or  when  they wanted  todo  it.  They  don't  follow  and  have  not  followed,  as  far  as  I know,  thepractice  of  consistently putting  these  amounts  in  the  market  on  aregular  basis.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  If  I remember  correctly--Ted Trumanmight  know--when  I was  at  the  Treasury  the  amount  of  the  two  itemsthat  Henry  mentioned was  $1 to  $2  billion a year.  And we  did  not  urgethem  to  follow a  policy,  Henry,  of  immediately  selling  it  out  as  theygot  it  in,  but  they  did  try  to  follow  an overall,  longer-term  policyof  averaging  out  that  way.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  They've been  doing  this  for  many  years  and  havealways  done  it  in  this  way.  The  amounts  I think  are  larger  than--

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  It  sticks  in  my  mind  that  troop  payments  weresomewhat  less  than  $100  million a month.  That would  be  somewhat  morethan  $1 billion  just  on  that  score  alone  in  a  calendar  year  and  thenthey  would  have  a couple  of  hundred  million  in  income.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  Troop  costs  certainly  used  to be  at  least  thatmuch;  that  may  have  declined.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any  other  discussion?  Well,  I take  itthat  there  is  a willingness  to  renegotiate  all  the  swaps  or  to  renewthem  for  another  year.  There  is  not  much  renegotiation  involved.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Questions?

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  On this  foreign  issue:  If  the  spread  firstwent  down  and  then went  back up  to  where  it  was  at  the  time  of  theissue,  is  there  any  justification for  any  bank to  say  that  they wouldhave  lost  money  had  they  gone  in  on  that  and  that  they were  smart  notto  go  in  on  it?11/7/84

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Well,  I think some  who went  in  on  it  feltthat  it  was  worth  something,  just  for  the  prestige  or  the  advertisingfactor.  One  had  that  sense  on  the  bids  that  came  in,  and  I think  thatsome  modest  losses  probably were  taken  in  the  course  of  doing that.Certainly, one  hears  that  the  next  time  around  the  spread  is  notlikely  to  be  as  large  as  that  32  basis  points--that  maybe  half  thatwould  be  justifiable.  That  was  the  feeling  I was  getting.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The  Japanese  felt  an  obligation  tocooperate.  I think  that  was  a  significant  factor  that  wouldn'tnecessarily  be  there  in  the  future  to  such  a  degree.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I would  like  to  inquire,  Peter:  When  did  wedrop  the  borrowing  level  from  $750  to  $700  million?  I must  tell  youas  a preface  that  I was  surprised.  The  first  time  I  realized  it  wasfrom  the  Bluebook, which  I thought  was  a mistake;  I went  back  to  thedaily wires  and  there  was  no  indication  that  I could  find  that  theborrowing  level  had  been  dropped.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Just  a week  ago,  I believe.  I am  confidentit  was  mentioned.  Well,  I can't  say  I read  the  wire  of  the  call.  Iknow  that  it  certainly was  reviewed  at  the  conference  call.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  If  it  wasn't  in the  wire,  it  should  have  been.It  must  have  been  an  oversight.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Last  Thursday  or  Friday.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I think  I went  back  over  [the  wires  of]  the  lastweek.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  It  was  right  after  that  first  week  of  the  two-week  period.  We  ended  up  at  $700  million  right  about  that  time  forthe  average  borrowing  level  and  it  seemed  sensible to  make  it  $700million,  given  all  that  had  happened.  It  should  have  been  in  thememorandum  of  the  call.  If  it  wasn't,  it  was  certainly an  oversight.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Well,  I could  be  mistaken,  but  I don't  think  so.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  It  has  been  an  interesting market.  Ithink  that  the  range  of  short-term interest  rates  is  predicated  moreon  a market  anticipation  of  a fed  funds  rate  closer  to  9-1/2  percentthan  the  10  or  9-7/8  percent  that  it  has  been  averaging  lately.  So,there  is  a  question--not  that  we're  getting  into  that  now--butassuming  there's  some  further  easing,  the  question  is  whether marketswill  assume  that's  the  last;  I doubt  that  they will.  They'll  probablyassume  there  will  be  a  discount  rate  cut  later  on  and  the  markets  willthen  take  it  even  further  and  we  may  continue  to  get  some  lower  ratesthan  the  projections.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You  say  the  economy was  expanding  morerapidly  in  September  and  October.  This  is  what  the  employment  figuresfor  October  show as  I understand  it.  That  does  not  seem  to  be  matchedby  industrial  production  or  by  consumption necessarily.

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  We  said  more  rapidly  in  October  than  in

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  In  employment.

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  That's  true.  The  gains  in  employment  inyear.  I think  that's  unsustainable.  It  looks  a  little  odd.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I understand  the  number.  How  do  youinterpret  the  unemployment  claims  figure?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  To  start  out  I mentioned  conflicting  signs,and  that  indeed  is  one  of  them.  Initial  claims  for  unemploymentinsurance  have  been  edging higher,  including  those  for  the  week afterthe  labor  market  reports  were  taken.  We  are  estimating,  as  I noted,that  industrial  production was  up  about  a quarter  of  a percent  inlevel  of  production  is  still  below what  we  saw in  the  summer.  Thereare  many what  I would  view as  conflicting  indicators  of  what  ishappening.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  a  lot  of  that  increase  in  employment  in

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  The  bulk of  it.  I think  industrial  productionis  related  [more]  to  the  manufacturing  employment.  But  for  somereason,  people  are  going  out  and  hiring  lots  of  new employees  inservices  and  trades.

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  I met  yesterday with  the  chairman  of  theI asked  him about  the  October  retail  sales.  He  saidthat  their  sales  were  lower  than  they  expected  and  as  a  consequencethat  their  inventories  are  up  about  5  percent  from  where  they  thoughtthey  would  be.  He  attributes  it  largely  to  the  fact  that  Octoberweather was  unusually  warm and  that  people  just  don't  buy winterclothing until  the  weather  turns  cold.  He  is  expecting  a  very  strongChristmas  selling  season.  That,  for  whatever  it's  worth,  is  theview.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  He  does  recognize  that  he  had  a very  soft

MR.  MORRIS.  Yes.  But  he  thinks  he  knows  why--the weatherfactor.  It  wasn't  something that  alarms  him.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Governor  Martin.11/7/84

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I just  want  to  underline  some  of  the  mixedsignals,  Jim.  I note  that  the Michigan  consumer  confidence  measurewas  off  a little  in  October.  I don't  put  a big  weight  on  that.  Thehours  worked  quantum  always  puzzles  me  a bit,  but  I notice  the  hoursworked  were  down  in  October  according  to  the  Labor  Department.  TheChairman  has  mentioned  that  initial  claims  for  unemployment  were up.The  purchasing  agents  survey  is  not  a good  quantitative  measure--itwas  revised  three  times  ex  post  out  of  the  [unintelligible]  data--butfor  whatever  it's  worth  it  shows  reductions  in  new  orders,  deliveryspeed,  inventories,  and  payrolls,  and  less  price  increases.  I thinkperhaps  more  important  were  the  preliminary  indications  that  thethird-quarter  real  GNP  may  be  revised  downward  due  to  the  merchandisetrade  deficit  number.  If  that  is  1.7,  not  2.7  percent,  it  may  requirea rethinking  of  some  of  the  inventory  changes.  It  already  has  beenrevised  down  once  from  3.6  percent.  I don't  know what  a  soft  landingis,  but  an  80  percent  decline  from the  first  half, when  we  had  GNPgrowth  of  8.4  percent--I  don't  know how  soft  that  landing  is.  Theundercarriage  of  the  vehicle  may be  slightly bent  in  that  kind  of[scenario].

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  it's  still  above  the  runway.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  It's  above  the  runway  but  perhaps  without  anywheels!  At  any  rate,  your  comment  with  regard  to  oil  prices,  foodprices,  and  other  indications  of  inflation  out  there  in  the  future  isreassuring.  Imports  are  still  soaring--I'm  tying  onto  the  Chairman'scomments  as  usual  here--but  those  imports  are  having  employment  andincome  effects  in  U.S.  firms.  We  know  that.  It  seems  to  me  thatthere  is  a risk  of a  growth  recession in  the  first  and  second  quartersof  next  year.  I too  have  talked  to  retailers  who  feel  they  will  getthrough  the  holiday  selling  season well  and  then  have  very  quiet  firstand  second  quarters.  And  I  see  the  risk  of  a  growth  recession, withrising  unemployment  and  very  low  real  growth  taking  off  from  that  1.7or  1.5  percent.  I saw one  model's  output  that  had  1.2  percent  for  thethird  quarter, which  I don't believe,  but  it  begins  to  get  yourattention,  I think.  The  consumer  comes  into  the  first  and  secondquarters  with all  those  new  cars  bought  on  credit  and  all  those  otherconsumer  durables  and  is  paying  the  kinds  of  real  interest  rates  onepays  today,  and  I don't  know whether  that  adds  up  to  a  snapback  ornot.  It  doesn't  to  me.  I think  that  the  risk  is  so  high  that  weshould  be  very  concerned  about  it.  If  we  get  your  [projected]  3.5percent  real  [GNP]  for  the  fourth  quarter  and  run  along  at  about  3 or3-1/2  percent  for  1985--given  the  margin  of  error,  no  disrespectintended--it  seems  to  me  that  again  gets  to  be  a  precarious  positionto  be  in  with  a substantial  downside risk.  If we  get  one  or  twoexogenous  factors  in  there when  the  economy  is  hovering around  a 3percent  level,  unemployment  can  get  started  up  again.  The  foreigncompetitor  is  still  cutting  into  those  employment  rolls.  So,  I thinkthe  margin  of  error  is  substantial.  I would  hate  to  see  the  Congresscome  back  into  this  town,  this  font  of  all  the wisdom  in  the  universe,facing  a  1 percent  real  growth  figure  and  rising  unemployment.  Wewould  just  get  some  dandy  decisions  in  the  fiscal  area  in  thatcircumstance.  I think we  are  facing  an  increasing  downside  risk.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Jim,  the  last  time  you  talked  some  about  theprobabilities.  May  I ask whether  you  have  anything  new to  say  aboutthat?  That  is,  have  you  increased  the  probability  of  something  aroundzero  compared  with  six weeks  ago  or  whenever  we  met  last?11/7/84

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  There  is  a  probability  of  negative  growth  inthe  fourth  quarter  of  19  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Are you  rounding,  or  is  that--?

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Jim, what  about  the  probabilities  in  the  firstand  second  quarters?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  This  comes  out  of  the  econometric  modelexercises we  performed.  The  model  said  19  percent  for  the  fourthquarter  and  15  percent  for  the  first  quarter;  then  it  drifts  in  therange  of  25  or  30  percent,  let's  say,  in  the  latter  part  of  1985.

MR.  KICHLINE.  Two  consecutive  quarters  is  very  low--1  to  2percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Rice.

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  Mr.  Chairman,  Governor  Martin  said  a good  part  ofwhat  I had  in  mind  except  that  I  don't  expect  a  growth  recession  inthe  first  half  of  next  year.  I don't  have  any major  argument  with thestaff  forecast.  But  I am  more  comfortable  with  the  longer-term  partof  the  forecast  than  I am with  the  forecast  for  the  current  quarter.As  was  pointed  out  in  the  briefing,  the  performance  of  the  currentquarter  is  very  sensitive  to  the  increase  in  consumer  expenditures;  wehave  to  get  a  substantial  increase--on  the  order  of  5 percent  plus  inthis  quarter--in  order  to  get  the  projected  growth  for  this  quarter.In  addition,  even  if  we  get  this  substantial  increase  in  consumptionexpenditures,  the  stimulus  to  GNP  depends  on  the  distribution  of  theseconsumer  expenditures  between  imports  and  the  rundown  of  inventory.So,  the  net  stimulus  to  real  GNP  may  not  be  as  strong  as  projected.On the  other  hand,  it  may well  work  out  that  output  does  increase  inthe  range  of  3-1/2  percent.  My  only  point  is  that  for  this  quarter  weshould  be  prepared  to  see  an  increase  in  real  GNP  of  significantlyless  than  3-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Perhaps  in  line with  previous  comments,  I'mbeginning  to  sense what  I think  is  quite  a different  tone  in  our  areathan what  I reported  at  the  previous  meeting.  I have  suggested  in  thepast  that  the  Middle  West  has  not  participated  very  fully  in  therecovery  and  expansion,  and  that  continues  to  be  the  case.  But  somethings  may  be  developing  that  signal  broader  problems.  The  badbusiness  has  continued to  be  bad.  The  backlogs  of  orders  are  runningdown.  But  those  businesses  that  have  done  better  than  others  arebeginning  to  feel  the  slowdown.  One  CEO  that  I talked  with who workswith what  he  calls  pressure  curves,  which  are  some  kind  of  regressionanalysis  on  the  rate  of  incoming  orders,  says  those  are  beginning  toindicate  to  him  that  we  are  heading  into  a downturn.  Specifically:The  appliance  business  is  noticeably weaker;  heavy  trucks,  which were11/7/84very  strong  early  in  the  year,  are  now turning  down;  and  the  trucktrailer  business  market was  up  because  of  a  legislative  change but  isclearly  turning around  and  slowing  down.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  business?

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  Truck trailer.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That  means  double  trailers.

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  There  was  a legislative  change  that  provided  fordouble bottoms  and  that  really  ballooned  the  market.  That  is  comingdown.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let  me  just  interrupt  for  a second.  I hadthe  impression  that  heavy  trucks  were  doing well--that  they  had  gonedown  and  then  gone  up.

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  Orders  booked  for  very heavy  trucks,  Class  8trucks,  are  down  substantially  and  their  production  is  down.  A  largeretailer--which  is  frankly  a  euphemism  for

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Let's  see  if  they  told  you  the  same  thing  theytold  me!

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  We  had  a meeting  of  [local]  economists  a week  orso  ago  and  their  representative,  who  had  been  quite  optimistic  aboutthe  Christmas  outlook,  is  now  a lot  less  optimistic.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  They  did.

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  They  are  expressing  some  doubts  about  the  outlookfor  retail  sales.  This  suggests  that  while  we  thought  the  softlanding--or  the  reduction  from  the  very  high  first  and  secondquarters--was  a welcome  thing,  it  may be  something  a bit  morefundamental.  I'm beginning  to  wonder  about  that.  I don't  disagreewith  the  staff  forecast,  but  it  tends  to  be  a  little  on  the  high  side,to  me  at  least.  The  GNP  numbers  look high  both  for  this  quarter  andfor  next  year.  Housing  starts  and  auto  sales  look  a little  high.  So,consistent with  [the  views  of]  Governor  Rice  and  Governor  Martin,  Ithink there  is  an  increasing  risk  of  low or  perhaps  even  negativegrowth  rates.I just  can't  let  the  moment  go  by  without  commenting  thatconditions  in  the  agricultural  sector  are  continuing  to  deteriorate.What  has  been  a very difficult  situation  has  only  gotten worse  withthe  passage  of  time.  The  rains  are  now  complicating  the harvestseason;  commodity  prices  are  down;  meat  prices  are  down;  and  landvalues  are  continuing  to  decline.  [The  latter]  is  particularly  truein  Iowa where  admittedly  they have  come  down from  pretty high  levels,but  they  are  in  a decline  that's  very  significant.  This  is  beginningto  back up  even more  with  regard  to  nonperforming  loans  in  theagricultural  banks.  The  banks  keep  saying  that  their  problems  aremanageable;  nonetheless,  these  are  the  kinds  of  things  that  can  turnaround  pretty  rapidly.  Based  on  the  calendar  we  are  at  a time  of  theyear  when  for  the  next  few months  things  [should]  only  get  better.They  ought  to  be  better  now than  they  are.  And  the  fact  that  they  arebad  would  indicate  that  in  the  next  few  months  things  are  going  to  get11/7/84worse.  Agricultural  equipment manufacturers  are  continuing  to  gothrough  just  a very  dismal  period.  The  outlook  is  poor  and  they arepulling  down their  production  schedules  very  significantly.  There  isplenty  of  tractor  and  combine  equipment  at  the  retail  level,  soproduction  is  going  to  be  very  weak  well  into  1985.  Our  agriculturaleconomist, who  is  a pretty  conservative  guy  not  given  to  extremes,said  that  in  his  view we  are  facing  the  worst  set  of  circumstances  inthis  area  that  he  has  known  in  his  whole  experience  at  the  Bank.  Idon't  think that  we  are  at  a turning  point  here,  but  I would  certainlythink  that  the  odds  have  changed  significantly  and  that  theprobability  of  going  into  a period  of  lower  rates  of  growth  than  wethought  in  the  past  is  increasing.  It  is  certainly  higher  than  it  wasat  the  past  meeting  or  two.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  In  my  District  if  you  talk  to  people who  arerunning  companies,  they  still  have  fairly  good  expectations  for  1985but  are  less  sure.  Some  doubts  are  beginning  to  creep  in  and  I thinkwe're  in  a  period  where  expectations  could  change.  The  currentresults  are  quite  mixed.  Manufacturing  tends  to  be  flatter.  Inretailing,  I find  that we  talk to  one  retailer  and  things  look  good  inSo,  the  current  indicators  are  rather  mixed.  I do  think,  however,that  if  we  continue  to  get  these  mixed  current  indicators,  the  longer-term  expectations  are  going  to  shift.  If  you  start  out  with  reallygood  feelings  about  1985,  I think uncertainty  tends  to  undermine  them.So  I think,  as  has  been  said  around  the  table  starting  with  Governorturning  point but  it's  a period  of  increasing doubts.  And  if  we  don'tbegin  to  see  some  pickup  very  soon,  attitudes  about  1985  will  shiftsignificantly.  If  you  felt  strongly  a month  ago  that  we  were  having  asnapback,  you have  to  be  a  lot  less  sure  about  that  now.  If  lastmonth  you were  leaning  toward  [an  expectation  of]  a  growth  recession,you  have  to  be  leaning more  in  that  direction.  My  own  view  is  thatI'm  fairly  uncertain.  There  is  a high  degree  of  uncertainly  aboutwhere  things  are  going,  but  I think  the  risks  have  shifted  toward  aslower  economy than  I,  at  least,  would  have  thought  a month ago.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I approach this  with  alittle  different  view  from  the  other  speakers  this  morning.  That'sprimarily,  I suppose,  because  of  where  I live  and  work.  To  be  sure,economic  activity  in  the  Atlanta  District  did  go  through  a  period  ofmoderation  in the  summer  but  we have  seen  some  pickup.  Generallyspeaking,  I think  that  economic  activity  is  fairly  healthy.  Most  ofthe  indicators  show  strength,  although  there  are  some  weak  areas.  Wehave  heavy defense  spending,  particularly  in  the  electronic  andaerospace  industries;  oil  and  gas  [activity]  is  even  picking up  in  theLouisiana  area;  and  the  carpet  industry,  construction,  and  housing  arepicking  up.  In  fact,  housing  surged  by  about  52  percent  in  theSoutheast  in  the  month  of  September.  Tourism  continues  to  be  good.The  weak  spots  are  forest  products  and  textiles  and  other  export-related  areas.  Now,  retail  sales  have been  off  even  in  our  area;  theypicked up  in  September  and  fell  off  again a  little  in  October.  All  ofthe  retailers  I speak  to  are  experiencing downturns  from theirprojections;  their  sales  are  not  up  to  plan.  They  attribute  this,  as11/7/84others  have  said,  to  the  unusually warm weather  in  October.  They  area bit  cautious  about  Christmas,  although  I think  most  of  them  arefairly  confident  that  they  are  going  to  have  a good  Christmas  season.Agriculture  is  a mixed  bag because  of  a number  of  factors,  includingdrought  followed  by  very heavy  rain  in  early  November.Looking  beyond  the  Southeast,  which  is  perhaps  not  typical[of  the  nation],  I tend  to  agree  with  the  staff  forecast  of  renewedgrowth  in  the  fourth  quarter  and  in  1985,  particularly because  I thinkthat we  have  not  yet  seen  the  effects  working through  the  economy  ofthe  lower  interest  rates  that  we've  recently  experienced.  On  theinflation  side,  I am  a  little  less  confident  about  the  staff'sprojection.  I still  think  that  is  a problem that  we  really have tokeep  our  eye  on.  I think the  dollar  is  going  to  come  off  although,like  everybody  else,  I won't  be  very  quick to  say  when that  willhappen.  But  I think  we  are  going  to  see  the  dollar  coming  off,  withits  implications  for  inflation.  Also,  the  numbers  that  I have  seensuggest  that  wage  settlements  in  the  service  sector have  not  beennearly  as  low as  they  have  been  in  manufacturing.  And,  of  course,  wehave  the  fiscal  stimulus,  which  I don't  see  being  removed  very  quicklywhen  Congress  comes  back.  So,  on  balance,  Mr.  Chairman,  I think wecan  expect  reasonably  good  growth  in  1985.  I view the  risk  not  as  oneof  negative  growth  but  rather  of  renewed  inflation.  Even  if  we  didn'tget  3-1/2  percent  real  GNP  in  1985,  I think that  even  2-1/2  to  3percent  growth would  still  be  fairly  decent  and  not  anything  to  beterribly worried  about.  At  this  point,  I am  not  concerned  aboutrecession  or  any  kind  of  negative  growth  in  1985.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Well,  the  staff's  projection  for  the  fourthquarter  is  about  in  line  with what most  private  forecasters have  beensaying;  it's  certainly  plausible  and maybe  even  the  most  likelyforecast.  But  I have  to  agree  with Preston Martin  and  Emmett  Rice  andEd  Boehne  and  Si  Keehn:  I believe  the  risk  has  shifted  to  the  lowside  since  we  last  met.  As  Jim Kichline  pointed  out,  there  arecertainly  some  statistics  that  suggest  that  growth  picked  up  inBut  I think  we  have  to  bear  in  mind  that  given  the  export/importpicture,  even  if  final  demand  strengthens,  that  doesn't  necessarilymean  that  we  are  going  to  have  equivalent  strength  in  domesticemployment  and  demand.  People  may,  as  you  said,  Mr.  Chairman,  belining  up  to  unload  those  imports.  Moreover,  the  lack of  growth  in  M1since  midyear  certainly  makes  it  less  likely  that  there  will  be  anysustained  resumption  in  growth  any  time  soon.  In  short,  I see  someserious  risks  in  the  near-term  economic  future  and  I think we  ought  tokeep  those  in mind  as  we  address  policy  today.

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Governor Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Well,  I am agnostic  on  the  outlook.  I think  ithas  deteriorated  somewhat.  I made  a list  for  myself  of  strong  andweak  factors  and  I stopped  when  I reached  12  on  each  side  and  had  anumber  more.  But  I think  the  nature  of  the  choices  that  we  have  is  alittle  different.  Expansions  don't  go  on  forever;  at  some  point  therewill  be  a pause--a  growth  recession, hopefully  not  a  real  recession.If  we  had  the  choice  of a  growth  recession  in  the  near  future  or  areal  recession  a year  later,  for  instance--11/7/84-10-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What's  a  growth  recession?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  When unemployment  rises  but  GNP  still  rises--inother  words,  growth  below potential.  If  we  had  that  and  it  werereversed  subsequently,  that  to  me would  be  a  less  ominous  thing  than  anew  real  recession.  And  that  might  well  be  a choice  because  thethings  one  would  have  to  do  in  order  to  make  sure  that  there  is  nogrowth  recession  may very  well  generate  imbalances  or  maladjustmentsand  set  in  motion  [forces]  that  a year  or  two  later  might  produce  areal  recession.  They  might  also,  of  course,  get  us  back  intoinflation.  Starting  from 5 percent  inflation,  it  seems  to  me  oneought  to  use  special  caution  in  dealing  with that  prospect.  It's  notas  though  we  were  starting from  close  to  zero.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  not  exactly  at  5 percent  either.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  I think  the  underlying  inflation  rate  is  ofthat  order  if  one  removes  all  the  temporary  [influences].  If  we  lookat  the  probabilities  of what  is  going  to  happen,  they  may  be  evenlybalanced between  a  resumption  of  the  expansion  or  a growth  recession.I doubt  that  it  would  be  a  real  recession.  If  we  look  at  the  risksthat  lie  beyond  that,  action  to  keep  [the  economy]  growing  at  allcosts  might  produce  a much worse  situation  later  and  might  conceivablyrelaunch  us  into  inflation.  I think  those  possible  costs  are  muchhigher  than  if  the  economy  wants  to  take  a  short  pause  and  then  resume[growth]  again.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Gramley.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  As  I look  at  the  numbers  coming  in,  I aminclined  to  agree  with  the  staff  that  they  do  suggest  there  is  someimprovement  in  activity  going  on.  When  I think  of  how the  numberswere  coming  in  a month  or  two  ago,  the  recent  figures  look  to  me  a lotmore  optimistic.  The  last  figure  on  new  orders  for  nondefense  capitalgoods  was  up  after  a couple  of months  of  decline.  Shipments  were  upquite  strongly.  The  last  figure  we  had  for  retail  sales  was  up;  wedon't  know what  October  will  bring.  I  read  the  Beigebook  and  Ithought  it  was  saying  that  the  gains  we  had  in  September  seemed  to  besustained  in  October  even  though  that  doesn't  seem  to  be  confirmed  bydepartment  store  sales.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Nor  by  the  comments  around  here.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Well,  we  haven't  heard  from  everybody  yet.  Butcertainly,  the  comments  in  the  Beigebook  did  not  reflect  what  we'rehearing today.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I think  somebody  else  wrote  the  Beigebook!

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  We're  now  looking  at  a period  of  rising  autoproduction--increasing  availability  of  models  instead  of the  reversethat  was  going on  in  the  summer.  The  last  figures  on housing  startsand  new home  sales  were  up  in  contrast  to  earlier weakness.  Thecoming  in  during  the  summer;  indeed,  we  had  a turnaround  inmanufacturing employment  from  a rather  sizable  decline  in  September toan  increase  in  October.  In  a  period  like  this  there  is  bound  to  beuncertainty.  As Henry  mentioned,  you  can  list  a dozen  factors  on  the11/7/84-11-positive  side  and  a dozen on  the  negative  side,  and  there  is  room  fordoubt  among  reasonable  people  as  to  where  things  are  going.  We'vebeen  through  this  sort  of  pause  many,  many  times  in  periods  ofeconomic  expansion.  If  you  asked what  basic  factors  were  driving  theeconomy  during  the  first  six  quarters  of  recovery--strong  fiscalstimulus,  a  lot  of  consumer  confidence,  low  inflation,  the  technologydriving business  fixed  investment--I  think those  factors  are  stillthere.  And  I'm  about  75  percent  certain,  personally,  that  theincoming  figures  a month  and  two months  from  now will  show  a morepositive  trend.  I do  not  worry  about  the  possibility  that  third-quarter  GNP  growth will  be  revised  downward.  I don't  doubt  that  atall.  That  is  what  happened  in  the  past.  Indeed,  if  it  turns  out  thatthe  downward  revision  reflects  a lower  rate  of  inventory  investment,that  would  be  on  balance  a plus  and  not  a minus.  I agree  with  thestaff  forecast.  I think we  will  see  some  strengthening  in  activity.I don't  know whether  it  is  going  to  be  in  the  fourth  quarter  and  Idon't  really  care.  It's  a question  of  whether  or  not  it  comes  alongsoon  enough,  as  I think  it  will,  to  generate  the  kind  of  growth  thatthe  staff  is  forecasting  for  1985.  And  I think they  are  about  righton  the  button.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  In  the  Twelfth  District,  the  pace  of  economicexpansion  really has  slowed  dramatically.  We  just  haven't  seen  thebounceback  in  sales  that  is  reported  in  some  Districts.  One  thingthat  is  going  quite  strongly  in  our  District  is  nonresidentialconstruction;  in  some  of  our  leading  cities  it's  almost  of  boomproportions.  But  it's  certainly  clear  that  the  reduction we've  seenso  far  in  mortgage  rates  has  been  insufficient  to  prevent  both  theconstruction  and  the  sale  of  new homes  from  falling further.  That's  aweak area.  And  as  I've  been  reporting  for  a long  time  now,  the  strongdollar  and  the  situation with  foreign  imports  are  hurting  a good  partof  Western  industries  such  as  forest  products  and  primary metals,  andthat  is  reducing  the  overall  growth of  manufacturing  employment  to  acrawl.  The  agricultural  situation  is  pretty  grim  in  a good  many  ofour  states.  In  sum,  I think  the  balance  has  changed  toward  the  enginestalling  here.  If  the  plane  is  still  in  the  air,  it's  about  to  makesomething worse  than  a soft  landing.  I agree with  much of  what  wassaid  by  Governors  Martin and  Rice  and  Presidents  Keehn,  Boehne,  andothers.  Monetary  policy  is  supposed  to  be  flexible  and  I think  thetime  has  come  to  err  a bit  on  the  side  of  ease  unless  the  situationclarifies.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Corrigan.

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  My  own  view is  that  the  staff  forecast  isprobably  about  on  the  mark.  In  fact,  I  still  very  much  lean  to  theview that  in  the  next  two  or  three  quarters  as  a whole,  there  is  agood  chance  that  the  economy will  be  stronger  than  the  staff  forecastrather  than  weaker.  I may be  a little  less  certain  about  that  nowthan  I was  six weeks  ago,  as  are  other  people;  nevertheless,  that'sstill  where  I'd  put  the  probabilities.  The  uncertainty  factor  clearlydoes  reflect  the  very,  very  near-term  outlook.  What  is  this  mishmashof  statistics  and  anecdotes  really telling  us?  On  the  retail  salesside,  we had  meetings  last  week with the  CEOs  of  all  the  big  companiesin  Minneapolis--and  there  are  two  very  sizable  retailers  headquarteredthere--and  they,11/7/84-12-remain  extremely  bullish  about  the  outlook  for  retailsales  in  the  near  term  notwithstanding this  pronounced  slowing  in  thelast  two  weeks  of  October.On  the  other  side  of  the  picture,  a  couple  of  the  companiesin  the  Twin  Cities  that  are  major  manufacturers  and  suppliers  ofelectronic  gear  and  happen  to  be  thought  of  as  computer  companies--infact,  they make  lots  of  components  that  go  into  both  commercial  andresidential  construction--reported  a  surge  in  industrial  bookings  inthat  they  manufacture  and  sell  is  associated  with  housing,  they don'tknow  whether  it's  related  to  new  housing or  renovation,  of  course.But  in  October,  or  I  should  say  the  30  days  ending  last  Thursday,  theyhad  an all-time  record  30-day  pace  of  activity  for  bookings  andshipments  of  electronic  components  that  go  into  residential  units.rates  that  we've  seen  is  beginning  to  take  hold  a  little.  While  thehousing  sales  figures  in  the  last  set  of  numbers  were  somewhat  mixedgeographically,  there  was  some  spark  at  least  for  one  month  evident  inthose  statistics  as  well.  When  I put  it  together,  again,  I wouldagree  with  many  of  the  comments  that  the  immediate  situation  is  harderthan  usual  to  read.  I personally  do  not  see  a  recession  in  sight  oranything  that  would  remotely  qualify  as  a  recession.I have  two  quick comments  on  imports  and  agriculture.  Thisimport  phenomenon,  as  I think  I said  once  before,  is  really  off  thechart.  There  is  no  doubt  that  that  makes  it  extremely  difficult  tofigure  out  where  the  driving  forces  are,  but  I will  just  try  to  putthat  in  perspective with  a  couple  of  concrete  examples.  For  example,one  of  these  companies  told me  that  just  in  the  past  six  or  sevenmonths  they  have  started  buying  disk drives  for  floppy  disks  forsmaller  computers  from  a Taiwanese  supplier.  They  are  delivered  inMinneapolis  for  $60  a unit  whereas  the  cheapest  they  can  make  themwith  no  markup--the  cheapest  they  can-manufacture  them  themselvesanyplace  in  the  United  States--is  $140  a unit.  Another  very  largehigh-tech  company  reported  to  me  that  within  the  time  frame  of  thisyear  they  started  buying  transformers for  their medium  size  main  framecomputers  from  Far  Eastern  sources.  Again,  the  price  delivered  tothem  in  the  United  States  is  one-third  of  the  cheapest  price  they  canmanufacture  that  type  of  component.  Indeed,  one  of  these  companiesreported  to  me  that  the  situation has  reached  a  point  where,  no  matterwhat  one  assumes  about  exchange  rates  or  anything  else,  from  the  pointof  view of  their  corporate  long-term  strategic  planning  they  have  nowfound  themselves  forced  for  the  first  time  to  consider  seriously  goinginto  off-shore  supply  in  a major  way  through  their  own  facilities.They  find  that  very  distasteful  but  the  economics  of  it  are  such  thatthey  find  themselves  compelled  to  think  in  those  terms.On  the  agricultural  situation,  I would  just  echo  what  SiKeehn has  said.  It  is  not  pretty.  And  I think  it  is  now  starting  toback  up  in  a way  that  you can  see  the  implications  of  it  on  the  smallbanks--all  these  darn  small  one-bank holding  companies  that  aresitting  out  there  and  are  leveraged  to  the  hilt.  It  could  be  verytroubling.11/7/84-13-

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  The  situation  from the  vantage  point  of  theCleveland  District  isn't  much different  from  what  has  been  expressedby  a number  of  people  around  the  table.  The  Fourth  District'sdifficulties  are  probably  due  to  a  [concurrence]  of  circumstances.First,  there  are  the  ongoing  structural  problems  and  the  intenseimport  competition, which we  feel  so  strongly,  together with  the  pausein  economic  activity.  Most  of  our  capital  goods  industries,  excludingmachine  tools,  have  noted  a flattening  in  orders  and  shipments.  Insteel  we've had  a few more  furnace  shutdowns.  Housing  in  the  Districthas  been  flat  at  best  for  several  months  and  our  bankers  continue tocomment  on  the  difficult  income  situation  that  farmers  find  themselvesin  and  the  problems  they  will  have  servicing  their  debts.  The  result,as  has  been  pointed  out,  is  increased  uncertainty  about  the  outlookfor  next  year.  In  our  District  we  still  have  the  basic  view  that  theconsumer will  lift  the  economy  into  growth  next  year;  around  theDistrict  a strong  Christmas  is  widely  expected.  Expectations  are  alsofor  a  continued  thrust  from business  investment,  although  presumablyat  a  slower  pace.  We  have  a basically  positive  outlook  but  a  lot  ofconcern  is  expressed;  I think the  concerns  of many  people  arise  inpart  because  of  how discouraged  they  are with  the  very  strong  importcompetition.  Others  focus  on  the  long-term  problems  of  the  economy:the  need  for  fiscal  policy  changes,  the  inflation  problems,  and  soforth.  Also,  expectations  are  generally  damped by  the  pause  that  wesee.  Although  expectations  are  for  growth  next  year,  they  are  veryshaky,  and  sometimes  I wonder  if  they  are  held  with enough  confidenceto  get  us  over  a few  disappointments  that  we  might  see  in  the  comingmonths.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Boykin.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOYKIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think  it  is  fair  to  characterizethe  situation in  the  Eleventh  District  as  one  where we  are  continuingto  see  some  improvement.  Employment  is  increasing,  industrialproduction  is  still  moving  up,  and  retail  sales  look fairly  good.  Iwill  say  that  we  have  had  slowdowns  from earlier  in  the  year.Weakness,  of  course,  continues  in  the  energy  industry,  and  that  mightbe  getting  a little  worse.  We  also  have  had  a downturn  inconstruction but,  as  I indicated  last  time,  I really don't  thinkthat's  all  that  bad.  I would  pretty well  agree  with the  Board  staff'sforecast.  I would  expect  the  fourth  quarter  obviously to  look  alittle  better  than  the  third  quarter.  At  least  from  the  people  I'vetalked  to  down  our  way,  I have  not  picked  up  any  real  concern  about  arecession  on  the  horizon  as  we  go  into  1985.  The  confidence  factor,at  least  my  own  confidence  factor,  is  not  quite  as  strong as  it  wasearlier.  So,  I'm  not  really  complacent.  On  the  other hand,  my  degreeof  discomfort,  if  you will,  is  probably  not  as  great  as  that  expressedby  a number  of  people  here.  It  seems  to  me  that  we're  just  cominginto  a period  when there  is  uncertainty  and  when  decisions  become  verydifficult.  I think  there  is  an  awfully  great  risk of  overreacting  towhat might  or  might  not  happen.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Ms.  Seger.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  I have  been  somewhat  concerned  about  slowingbusiness  conditions  for  several months  and  I still  am.  I won't  repeatall  the  signs;  I heard  them  earlier  and  you have  also.  I will  just11/7/84-14-add  two  things  that  I haven't  heard  mentioned  so  far.  One  is  that  intalking with  a number  of  business  economist  friends  who  are  neitherkooks  nor  politicians  I sense  a big  change  in  their  attitudes  in  thelast  six  weeks  or  so.  In  general  their  confidence  in  their  forecastsfor  next  year  seems  to  have  diminished.  Frankly,  if  I had  to  point  myfinger  at  one  factor  that  is  responsible  for  this,  it  would  be  thesignals  that  we  have  been  sending  from  this  building.  They  arelooking  at  the  slower  monetary  growth  in  the  last  four  months  and  as  agroup  are  not  interpreting that  as  poor  marksmanship  or  the  inabilityto  hit  our  targets.  They  are  interpreting  these  numbers  as  an  actualtightening,  particularly when  they  saw the  fed  funds  rate  shoot  backup  in  August.  So,  I think that  has  led  to  some  of  the  changes  inattitude.  Secondly,  I was  talking  to  a top  economist  for  one  of  theBig  Three  auto  companies  who  said  that  when  they  were  doing  theirmodeling  and  trying  to  forecast  auto  sales  for  next  year  they  lookedat  the  usual  relationships  among  employment,  income  growth,  creditavailability  and  all  the  things  that  they  know influence  auto  sales.They  came  up  with  a particular  forecast,  yet  because  of  their  lack  offaith  in  that  number,  they  peeled  off  about  300  to  400  thousand  unitsfrom  that  because  in  the  pit  of  their  stomachs  they  didn't  think  theycould  hit  the  number  that  came  out  of  their  model.  I am mentioningthis  to  suggest  that  if  there  is  a  risk,  I think  it  is  that  thesenumbers  [forecast]  for  the  fourth  quarter  and  for  1985  will  be  toohigh  rather  than  too  low.  I am not  saying  that  there  is  a  recessionaround  the  corner;  I am not  that  good  a forecaster.  But  I think  thereis  the  risk.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  One  thing  that  worries  a person who  looks  at  thebusiness  statistics  all  the  time  is  a  situation that  can't  very wellbe  explained  on the  basis  of  past  experience.  And  I  can't  very wellexplain why  business  is  as  weak  as  it  has  been  in  the  last  few months.That  makes  for  considerable  discomfort  in  a professional  economist.  Iam  very  nervous  at  the  present  time.  I felt  confident  that  therewould  be  a resurgence  in  the  economy this  fall  because,  like  Lyle,  Ithought  that we  had  just  a temporary  spell  of  reduced  consumption.  Ithought  the  economy would  come  along  in  the  fall  because  incomes  andexpectations  and  confidence  and  the  real  financial  value  of  assetswere  all  there  to  support  strong  consumer  spending.  I  guess  I stillthan  I am  tofeel  that.  I am  closer  in  view to  the  guy  from the  guy  from Christmas.  Nevertheless,  there  is  no  real  indication  of  such  aresurgence  in  attitudes  of  manufacturers  and  business  peoplegenerally.  The  one  thing  that  I have  never  dealt with  is  the  problemof  a steadily  rising  proportion  of  total  markets  being taken  up  withimports.  Because we  haven't  had  that  in  the  35  years  that  I have  beenan  economist,  it  does  occur  to  me  that  it's  possible  that  retail  salescan  look  good  and  strong  and  that  plant  and  equipment  spending  canlook  good  and  strong  and  it  won't  do  anything  for  the domestic  economyif  an  important  increment  of  that  demand  is  going  into  imported  goods.Therefore,  it  is  quite  possible  that  we  could  have  strength  in theindicators  of  the  kind  that  Bob  Forrestal  talked  about--retail  salesand  so  forth--but weakness  in  the  underlying  performance  of  theeconomy.  I think that's  a big  change  from  the  past,  and  it  seems  tobe  a  trend  that  is  still  persisting.in  thinking  that  we're  going  to  have  a  good11/7/84-15-The  other  thing that  may have  occurred--and  it's  very,  veryhard  to  know--is  that,  in  fact,  inflation  expectations  may  havesubsided  over  the  last  six  months.  We  are  getting  some  indications  ofthat  from  these  horseback  surveys  that  people  do  on  inflation.  But  Idon't  think  they  are  much  good;  they  really  just  reflect  what  hashappened  most  recently.  But  it  may be  that  we've  had  a period  of  lowincreases  in  wages  and  low  increases  in  profit  margins  for  a longenough  time  that  people  are  now beginning  to  believe  that  by  gollyinflation  isn't  going  to  go  back to  7 or  8 or  9 percent!  You mayremember  in  the  spring  that  it  wasn't  hard  to  find  outliers  likeMilton  Friedman who  thought  that  inflation  would  be  at  double  digitsby the  end  of  this  year.  That  has  disappeared  entirely.  That  also  issomething  that  could  affect  attitudes  and  the  speed  with which  plansare  put  in  place  in  order  to  beat  price  increases,  because  now  peopledon't  expect  the  price  to  increase whereas  before  they  did.I would  point  out  that  the  staff  forecast  is  nothing  to  writehome  about  in  terms  of  great  strength.  The  forecast  is  for  a littleover  3 percent  real  growth  over  the  next  five  quarters.  That's  not  ahigh  number.  I would  also  point  out  to  you  that  there  is  an  importantpresumption  in  that  forecast  and  that  is  that  real  imports  go  nohigher  than  they  are  now--that  the whole  import  thrust  is  behind  us.In  the  Greenbook,  if  you  look  at  constant  dollar  net  imports  on  a GNPbasis,  there  has  been  a deterioration  of  $35  billion over  the  pastfour  quarters.  Over  the  next  four  quarters  there will  be  nonewhatsoever,  if  that  forecast  is  accurate.  And  that  goes  into  the  GNPforecast.  If  you don't  believe  that  the  import  surge  has  ended,  thenyou  can't  really believe  a  forecast  as  strong  as  the  one  the  staff  hasshown.  I don't  know what  you  think, but  I think  that  imports  arestill  rising  pretty darn  rapidly  and  that  the  growth  in  imports  willnot  be  over  until we  can  change  the  terms  of  trade  in  which the  UnitedStates  deals.  So,  the  forecast  of  a little  over  3 percent  assumesthat  net  imports  stopped  growing  as  of  the  third  quarter,  which  isalready behind  us.  That's  not  such  a very  strong  forecast.Henry  speaks  about  inflation.  He  says  a  base  rate  of  5percent;  I would  say 4  percent.  It  is  [not]  zero.  But  unemploymentisn't  zero  either.  As  a matter  of  fact,  we  have  7-1/2  percentunemployment;  it  has  been  hanging at  that  number,  Henry,  and  I wouldargue  that  a  7-1/2  percent  unemployment  rate  gives  us  room for  furthergrowth  in  the  economy  in  the  sense  of  looking  at  the  performancecompared  with  some  kind  of  norm--what we  would  like  to  see  ideally.The  unemployment  rate  is  about  as  distressingly  above  where  it  oughtto  be  as  the  inflation  rate  is  above  what  it  ought  to  be.  As  I seeit,  it's  a  situation  in which  one  can  say  inflation  has  done  betterthan  one would  expect  based  on  recent  track  performance.  Unemploymentis  worse  than  it  ought  to  be  at  this  stage  of  a cyclical  recovery.Therefore,  although  I'm  not  sure  what  is  going  to  happen  in  theimmediate  future,  I think  that  the  economy  is  not  going  to  go  into  agreat  resurgence  in  terms  of  output  and  employment  and  I think  thereis  room for  some  more  growth than  seems  in  prospect  in  the  numbersthat  we  have.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  May  I just  correct  one  comment  on  the forecast?I don't want  to  dispute  the  basic  thrust  of  your  argument,  but  on  theimport  side  we  have  identified  a couple  of  areas--textiles  and  steel--where  it  is  pretty  clear  that  there  was  a buildup  in  imports  inanticipation  of  trade  policy  actions  that  did  occur  and  are  going  to,11/7/84-16-at  a minimum, put  us  back  toward  the  trend  of where  those  imports  wererelative  to  GNP.  It  is  partly  because we  have  taken  out  that  smallpiece--$2-1/2  billion in  1972  dollars--which  is  not  trivial  in  termsof  the  numbers  we  are  looking  at.  It's  2 or  2-1/2  percent,essentially,  in current  dollars.  We  have  taken  that  piece  out  andallowed  some  payback  of  it  so  that  we  get  the  absolutely  flat  picturethat  you  so  accurately  described.  So  we  do  have  a continued  rise  inimports  at  least  to  the  middle  of  next  year  absent  that  factor,  whichtells  us  the  dollar's  depreciation,  putative  depreciation,  takeseffect.  But  the  reason you  get  the  picture  in  the  Greenbook islargely because we  have  that  offsetting  payback  in  the  short  run  onimports.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  am  I looking  at  this  table  correctly?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  No,  that's  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  A  year  ago  you  had  a plus  $12  billion;  in  thethird  quarter  of  this  year  it's  a minus  $22.6  billion.  That's  achange  of  $34-35  billion.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  No,  no--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And  now, with  this  little  $2  billion  difference,you  have  essentially  stability  from  now  on  out?

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Is  this  imports  of  goods  or  goods  and  services?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  The  only  one  they  have  in  constant  dollars  isgoods  and  services.  I am  looking  at  page  1-21.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  But  I think the  staff's  forecast  is  for  someincrease  in  the  constant  dollar  value  of  goods  counterbalanced  by  ainvestment  income.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Well,  but  the  basic  story  is  correct.  Third-quarter  [imports]  of  goods  were  something  around  $100  billion  1972dollars,  which  is  close  to  $20  billion higher  than  it  was  a year  ago.[Unintelligible]  another  $3 or  $4 billion  in  goods  because  you haveoil  in  there  over  the  forecast  period.  So,  imports  of  services

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And that  is  in  the  GNP  forecast.  Am  I right,Jim?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  Correct.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Roberts.

[SECTION]

MR.  ROBERTS.  I am  seeing  in  my  District  some  of  the  changein  attitude  that  has  been  commented  on  by  others.  I had  a meetingwith  about  a dozen  chief  executive  officers  of  large  companies  lastweek  and  their  consensus was  that  business had  turned  toward  the  softside.  They  were  generally  concerned  about  inventory  levels;  it  wasnot  that  inventories  had  gotten  out  of  control,  but  the  focus  of  theseCEOs  had  moved  to  the  control  of  inventories.  The  retailers  spoke  ofa  good  Christmas  instead  of  their  previous  very  optimistic11/7/84-17-expectations  about  the  Christmas  season.  They  are  reassessing  theirprospects  in  the  retail  area,  and  this  group  included  four  nationalretailers who  had  a  pretty  good  feel  of  conditions  nationally.  Theywere  focusing  particularly  on  [sales  in]  recent weeks.  In  themanufacturing  sector,  one  thing  that  struck me  was  that  withoutexception,  none  of  them  sees  any  inflation anywhere  either  in  whatthey buy  or  in  their  ability  to  change  prices  of  what  they  sell.  Theyrelate  this  principally to  the  import  competition, which  seems  to  bepervasive.  All  of  them  one way  or  another  seem  to  be  experiencingthat  across  the  board.  The  other  thing  that  impressed me  was  thatthey  all  felt  that  wages were  under  complete  control--that  settlementsthat  had  occurred were  very modest  indeed,  and  their  expectationsabout  wage  settlements  were  of  the  same  variety.The  housing  area  has  been  fairly  stable;  we  have  had  somesoftness  in  single-family  starts  offset  by  multifamily  starts.  In  theappliance  manufacturing  area,  we  have  seen  specific  reductions.  Forexample,  the  GE  manufacturing  facility  in  Louisville  has  justannounced  another  1400  layoffs,  including  about  300  white  collarworkers.  In  the  textile  area,  where  import  competition  has  a bigeffect,  four  plants  in  Arkansas  have  just  been  closed  involving  about22,000  workers.  The  shoe  industry  in  Missouri  is  in  extremis,  as  theysay,  in  terms  of  import  competition.  Agriculture  in  particular  ishurting  now because  of  rains  that  are  delaying harvesting  and  causingsome  problems.  We  are  getting  reports  that harvesting  of  animals  isincluding breeding  stock  and  that  is  an  indication  of  problems  there.So,  when  I put  the whole  thing  together,  I  see  a  change  of  attitudeand  conditions  from a  slowing  in the  economy  to  an  economy  that  hasflattened  out.  My  judgment  is  that  the  staff  forecast  is  probablyoptimistic  for  the  fourth  quarter  and  for  next  year  as  well.  My  bestguess  is  that,  absent  a  significant  change  of  policy  soon,  the  nextmove  in  the  economy will  be  down.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  On  the  other  side  of  Missouri--

[SECTION]

MR.  ROBERTS.  It's  a  very  thin  edge.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  But  an  important  thin  edge.  In  the  TenthDistrict  there  has  been  no  improvement  in  those  areas  that  I haveexpressed  concern  about  before--principally  agriculture,  energy,  andthe  aircraft  manufacturing  industry.  There  are  a  couple  of  factors,however,  that  may  influence  the  future.  One,  in  the  agriculturalsector,  is  the  Administration's  program that  was  announced  a month  orso  ago  for  delaying  or  setting  aside  some  of  the  debt  of  theproducers.  That  is  now being  put  into  place  and  they  hope  to  have  itoperational  by  January  1.  For  your  information,  it  involves  amongother  things  setting  aside  25  percent  of  a  producer's  total  debt  up  to$200,000  and  delaying  that  for  a period  of  5 years  with  no  interestand  no  payback.  It  is  a  guarantee  program also  with  respect  to  thecommercial banks  that  are  financing  agriculture,  if  that  comes  about.It's  a pilot  program  in  five  states--Missouri,  Kansas,  Nebraska,Minnesota,  and  Iowa.  There  is  some  mixed  reaction from  theagricultural  sector,  but  it  is  something  positive  and  they  are  tryingto  assess  what  the  impact  will  be.  After  it  is  in  place  in  these  fivestates,  they  expect  to  expand  it  nationwide.11/7/84With  respect  to  the  energy  area,  OPEC  and  the  lowering  ofcrude  prices  have  damped  the  enthusiasm,  which was  not  very  great,  inenergy  discovery.  Another  factor  that  has  come  to  pass  most  recentlywas  the  announcement  by  Canada  that  they  were  going  to  reduce  theprice  of  natural  gas  imported  into  the  United  States  by  25  percent.  Alot  of  the  Tenth  District  is  very  heavily  engaged  in  natural  gasproduction,  so  that  could  further  depress  any  interest  in  discovery  orexploration  in  that  area.  There  is  a fairly  large  segment  of  theDistrict  involved  in  high-tech  business,  particularly  on  the  easternslope  of  the  Rockies.  Most  recently  there  have  been  rathersubstantial  layoffs--about  2,000  people--in  that  area  who  were  engagedin  the  production  of  semi-conductors.  I'm  told  that  the  demand  forsemi-conductors  worldwide  has  diminished  but  it  has  impacted  thisparticular  area  more  dramatically than  I think any  of  us  realizes.  Onthe  positive  side,  auto  assembly  [activity],  in  which we  have  a verylarge  number  employed,  is  going  full  out.  Everybody  is  back  andemployed.  Nonresidential  construction is  experiencing boom conditionsin  several  areas  in  our  District.  Recreational  activity  is  very high,with tourism  and  the  ski  industry  looking  forward  to  a very  good  year.I'd  just  note  that  in  New Mexico, which  is  a very  small  part  [of  ourDistrict]  population-wise  but  very  important  in  the  defense  industry,is  experiencing a boom  particularly  in  the Albuquerque  area  simplybecause  they  are  deeply  involved  in  the  production of  defenseequipment.With  respect  to  the  outlook,  I would  agree with  those  whothink  the  Greenbook  is  about  right  or  maybe  not  optimistic  enough.  Idon't  see  the  dangers  that  everybody  expressed  around  the  table  thatwe  are  going  to  drop  into  a  growth  recession,  if  you will,  in  thefourth  quarter  and  the  first  quarter  of  1985--or  even  if we  did,  thatthat  would  be  all  bad.  In  other  words,  I don't  see  the  potential  ofrecession as  a very  high  probability  or  any  probability  at  all.  Onthe  national  level,  I would  accept  the  staff  forecast  as  being aboutright.  And  if  we  get  it,  I would  be  delighted.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Morris.

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would  like  to  associate  myselfwith  the  Lyle  Gramley  school  of  predicting where  we  are.  I think  it'svery  typical  toward  the  second  year  of  an  expansion  to  run  into  aslower  rate  of  growth  in  the  economy  as  the  economy  shifts  to  a  lowerrate  of  inventory  accumulation.  And  I think  that  is  exactly  what  isgoing  on  right  now.  I would  assess  the  risks  of  a recession  as  closeto  zero.  I think  the  underpinnings  of  the  economy  are  very  strong.The  most  surprising  statistic  of  the  last  month was  the  440,000increase  in  employment.  That--particularly the  55,000  increase  indurable  goods  manufacturing  employment--was  much  bigger  than  I hadexpected.  These  are  not  the  kinds  of  numbers  that  one  sees  associatedwith  an  early  stage  of  going  into  a  recession.  Furthermore, we  havehad  a big  decline  in  interest  rates.  I think this  economy  is  going  tobe  very  responsive  to  that.  We  haven't had  enough  time  yet  to  assessthe  impact  the  interest  rate  decline  that  has  already  taken  place willhave.  We  see  one  sign  in  the  increase  in  new home  sales  and  anothersign  in  the  strength of  the  stock  market.  Another  sign  is[unintelligible].  But  I think we  haven't  yet  seen  the  full  effect  onthe  real  economic  activity  of  the  rate  declines  that  have  alreadytaken place.  So,  I find  the  pessimism that  I have  heard  around  thetable  from  many  sources  hard  to  understand.  And  I  don't  think  this11/7/84-19-comes  from  the  fact  that  I am  living  in  a  state  that  has  anunemployment  rate  of  3.7  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [Unintelligible.]

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  I am  living  in  a state  which  hasdouble  that  rate  of  unemployment  and  yet  I share  your  view,  Frank.  Idon't  quite  understand  the  level  of  concern  that  I hear  other  thanthat  it  is  the  inherent  nature  of  central  bankers  always  to  look  atthe  gloomy  side.  And  I think  the  sense  of  balance  would  be  not  amajor  shift  of  policy  as  Ted  Roberts  is  saying,  but  some  modest  thoughlimited  easing.  I won't  repeat  the  reasons  why  I think the  staffforecast  for  next  year  is  on  balance  probably as  reasonable  as  one  canexpect.  In  our  view it  might  be  somewhat  weaker  in  the  fourth  quarterbecause  of  inventory  adjustment.  But  the  general  feeling  in  myDistrict--what  I hear  from  business  leaders  and  from members  of  ourboard--is  that  there  will  be  good  Christmas  retail  sales  and  thatmanufacturing  is  not  showing the  earlier  growth  but  is  not  showing  anysignificant  softening  either.  I also  share  Henry  Wallich's  view--Idon't  always  agree  with Henry, but  I must  say  I do  this  time--that  thebusiness  cycle  is  still  with us  and  we  should  not  be  excessivelyalarmed  about  some  tapering  off  and  moderation.  And  even  though  3percent  isn't  high,  Chuck,  it  seems  to  me  that  that  is  a veryappropriate  level--if  that  is  what  we  actually  get  next  year.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  we  could  easily  afford  more.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Well,  I tend  to  assume  that  thedollar  is  going  to  come  off  more  and  I assume  there  will  beinflationary  pressures  that  will  result  from that--although they  won'tshow  up  too  immediately,  I suppose.  And  I would  be  concerned  aboutmuch more  than  a 3  percent  growth  rate.  I think  our  capacity  isgrowing  around  3 percent  and  it  may very  well  be  that  the  structure  ofthe  economy  and  our  comparative  advantage  has  changed  in  the  world  andthat  we  cannot  expect  to  go  back  to  a  level  of  unemployment  as  low  aswe  had  in  previous  recoveries.  Also,  in those  previous  recoveries  wegot  to  double-digit  inflation  so  we  then  tended  to  overreact  the  otherway.  It  seems  to  me  that  a steadier,  more  prudent,  balanced,  calmerpolicy would  be  in  the  direction  of  easing  which  does  not  reflect  asmuch concern  about  the  economy  as  I heard  around  the  table.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  why don't  we  hear  from Mr.  Axilrod.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are  there  any more  or  less  technicalquestions  or  comments?

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I have  a  technical  question.  As  you  try  to  sortout  what  is  behind  the  weakness  in  M1  and  whether  it's  from the  demandside  or  from  the  supply  side,  if  you look  at  reserves  over  the  lastcouple  of  months--which  is  on  the  supply  side  and  can  be viewed  insome  rough  way  as  a  [base]  for  creating money--reserve  growth,  as  youpointed  out,  has  been  quite  weak.  I wonder,  as  we  go  into  Novemberand  December  and  try  to  guard  against  the  continuation of  thisweakness,  if  there's  any value  in  looking  through  the  nonborrowedtarget more  to  reserve  growth  to  try  to  reduce  the  odds  of  continuedslow  growth.  Now,  that  presumes  that  part  of  the  problem  comes  from11/7/84-20-the  supply  side.  I just  wondered  technically if  you  have  anyreactions  to  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  President  Boehne,  say  the  Committeewanted  to  achieve  something  like  the  alternative  B path  or,  say,  7percent  growth  in  total  reserves  in  November.  [While]  it'stechnically  not  impossible  to  conduct  operations  in  an  effort  toachieve  that  if  the  Committee  wanted  it,  it  is  impossible  to  tell  youwith any  certainty,  other  than  the  way we  do  it  in the  Bluebook, whatis  likely  to  happen to  the  level  of  member  bank borrowing.  If  thedemand  for  those  reserves  doesn't  happen  to  be  there,  we  would  have  tokeep  throwing  nonborrowed  reserves  out  there  until  we  force  the  demandon  them--force  the  banks  to  create  the  required  reserves.  And  thatcould  take  a  very  substantial  drop  in  interest  rates  if  the  demanddoesn't  happen  to  be  there.  Our  best  guess,  as  is  in  the  Bluebookimplicitly,  is  that  it  would  not  take  a  substantial  drop  in  interestrates,  though  I would  [modulate]  that  a bit  if  the  latest  money  supplyfigures  I have  seen  hold  up  after  a  day  or  so.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I guess  I am  just  getting  at  this  supply/demanddivision  that  you mentioned.  Does  that  give  you  any  reading  as  towhether  more  of  the  problem  lies  with  the  supply  side  or  the  demandside?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  No,  I think  you have  to  look  at  therelationship  between  interest  rates  and  velocity.  Obviously,  therewould  be  more  money  out  there,  if  we  put  in  more  reserves  and  therewould  be  less  money,  vice  versa.  The way  I would  look  at  it  would  beto  try to  explain velocity.  That  is  what  I was  trying  to  do.  Doesthe  fourth-quarter  rise  in velocity  indicate  that  people  didn't  reallywant  the  money  and  that  they  are  quite  happy?  Or  does  it  indicatethat  people  simply  didn't  get  the  money  they  really  wanted  and  we  hada temporary  --in  effect,  arithmetic--rise  in  velocity  and  we're  goingto  see  that  reflected  later  in  income  as  they have  to  adjust  to  thefact  that  they  don't  have  as  much money  as  they want?  I don't  thinkjust  looking  at  the  reserve-to-money  relationship  can  tell  you muchabout  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Steve,  you  commented  on  the  possible  impact  ofthe  MMDA  alternative  to  less  interest  [on]  transaction  balances.  Itake  it  you  were  referring  to  the  surprise  in  October?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  But  why wouldn't  that  kind  of  impact  occur whenthe  rates  first  dropped?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  MMDAs were  rising  in  the  first  four  months  ofthe  year  at  a  slightly  faster  rate  than  they were  rising  in  October.And  then  they  stopped  rising  as  market  rates  went  up  and  banks  didn'tfollow  them all  the  way  up.  Then, with  this  recent  very  sharp  drop  inshort  rates,  banks  have  lagged  in the  extent  to  which  their  MMDA  rateshave  dropped.  And,  according  to  the  figures  we have  for MMDAs,  afterare  observing  in  the  figures--although we  have  problems  with  seasonaladjustments  because  we  don't  have  them  seasonally  adjusted--a  drop  inNOW  accounts  and  in  the  very  recent  figures  also  a drop  in  Super  NOWaccounts.11/7/84

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How big are  Super  NOW  accounts?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  The  level?  The  level  of  NOW  accounts  is  $140billion approximately.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Super  NOWs  are  what  level?

[SECTION]

MR.  ROBERTS.  $43  billion.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I think  I have  that  number.  They're  about  $45

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Is  that  included  in  that  $140  billion?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's  included;  so  there  is  $100  and  some  oddbillion.billion--

[SECTION]

MR. ROBERTS.  Steve,  are  you  saying  that  as  the  differentialbetween NOW  accounts  and  MMDAs  declines,  there's  a percentage  thatshifts  [to  MMDAs]  instead  of  the  contrary?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  [we  were]  reaching  for  hypotheses  toexplain this  back  in  the  second  half  of  1982  when  interest  ratesdropped  sharply  and  there was  a  sharp  rise  in  NOW  accounts.  At  thattime  there  were  no  MMDAs.  MMDAs  have  a  lower  reserve  requirement thanNOW  accounts  by  a lot.

[SECTION]

MR.  ROBERTS.  But  that's  an  interesting  thesis:  that  someonewho  accepts  a lower-than-market  rate  gets  more  interested  in  changingto  the  market  rate  as  the  spread  declines  instead  of  as  it  widens.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  I was  thinking  of  these  as  monies  thatare  in  the  market  now  that  shift  back  into  bank  deposits  as  rates  godown.  And  what  bank  deposits  do  they  shift  back  into?

[SECTION]

MR. ROBERTS.  Not  from NOWs  to  MMDAs  but  from  the  market  toMMDAs.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  And  instead  of  going  back  into  NOWs,  as  weexperienced  in  1982--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Why would  that  make  NOW  accounts  go  down?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  there  are  other  things  going  on  at  thesame  time,  obviously.  But  I was  thinking  mainly  of  shifts  from  the

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  keeps  them from  going up.  I  see  the  point.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  But  my  question  is:  Why wouldn't  that  haveoccurred  earlier  than  October?  I am trying  to  figure  out  October  andI can't.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  that  I really  can't  give  an  answer  to.The  banks'  MMDA figures  were  running  negative  between  5 and  6 percentand  then minus  1 percent  in  September.  Then  they  rose  to  an  8.8percent  rate  of  growth  in  October.11/7/84-22-

[SECTION]

MR.  ROBERTS.  For  a while  the  money  market  funds  were  moreattractive  than  the  bank  funds  and  that  spread  has  declined  morerecently.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  But  why  banks  have  chosen  to  lag  their  rates  atthis  point  is  hard  to  answer.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Guffey,  did  you  have a  question?

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Yes.  With  respect  to  the  October  number--and  Iknow this  won't  make  a great  difference--do  I remember  correctly  thatlast  year  when we  did  the  seasonal  adjustment  those  figures  for  thefourth  quarter,  including  October,  were  revised  up  substantially?Would you  not  expect  a similar  event  this  year?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  What  I have  readily  in  mind  is  that  for  thesecond  half  of  last  year  the  rate  of  growth  of  M1  was  raised  1-3/4percentage  points  at  an  annual  rate,  of  which  1 percentage  point  wasseasonal  and  .7 was  benchmark figures.  This  year,  we've  run  throughit  assuming  that  money  grew  7 percent  in  November  and  December  andthat  changes  the  configuration  somewhat  in  that  the  slowdown  occursmore  gradually  over  the  course  of  the  year.  But  you  still  would  get,of  course,  a much  slower  growth  in  the  latter months  of  the  year  thanin  the  first  several  months  of  the  year.  But  it  will  raise  July,percentage  points  depending  on  November-December.  There's  no  doubtabout  that;  it  goes  in  that  direction.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  That's  making a  substantial--

MR.  PARTEE.  What  if  November-December were  less  than  7percent?  If,  say,  November  and  December were  at  4 percent  rather  than7 percent,  would  that  have  changed  the  seasonal  distribution  and  inwhich  direction?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  I assume  it  would.  I assume  a lower  growthrate  would  tilt  a little  more  of  the  growth  into  the  second  half.  ButI didn't  run  it  for  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  I have  a  question about  the  contention  that  theincrease  in  velocity  in  the  fourth  quarter  might  be  explained  by  asupply  side  phenomenon  rather  than a  demand  side  phenomenon.  I knowthere  are  differences  in  speeds  of  adjustments,  depending  on  themodels,  but  if  you had  a  stable  money demand  function and  arestriction  of  supply  and  the  short-run  elasticities  of  demand  withrespect  to  interest  rates  were  a lot  less,  what  you  would  have  is  aphenomenon  in which interest  rates  rose  much more  than  they would  haveto  to  equate  money  demand  to  money  supply.  Well,  that's  not  theproblem we  are  looking  at  now.  Interest  rates  are  going  down,  not  up.It  seems  to  me  you have  to  argue  that  if we  have  not  had  a  downwardshift  in money  demand  either we  don't  really  understand  the  factorsaffecting money  demand,  which  is  possible,  or  that  our  estimatednominal  GNP  figure  for  the  fourth  quarter  is  way  too  high.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  The  only  thing  I would  add  to  that,  GovernorGramley,  is  that  apart  from the  fact  that  the  model  [unintelligible]relationships,  one  could  also  argue  that  interest  rates  are  higher11/7/84-23-than  they  otherwise  would  have  been,  obviously,  if  you had  reallyforced  in  the  money  now.  That's  pretty much what  I had  in  mind.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Do  you have  something to  say,  Mr.Sternlight?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  I was  going  to  add  a comment  on  the  questionSteve  was  raising  earlier  about  why  the  banks  have  lagged  in  bringingdown  their  rates  on  MMDA  accounts.  I think  one  reason  might  be  thatthey  see  that  as  a  rather  easy way  to  get  in  some  more  retail  moneyand  lessen  their  dependence  on  day-to-day  liability managed  funds.  Ithink some  of  them  are  conscious  of  the  problems  the  big banks  havehad  and  wanted  to  strengthen their  deposit  base  that  way.  That  couldhave  been  a factor.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  I'd  just  like  to  ask  Steve  a question  about  theuse  of  his  phrase  "searching for  hypotheses"  here  in  view  of  theunexpected  and  unwelcomed  decline  in  M1  in October,  which  seems  to  begetting worse.  If  there had  not  been  a  downward  shift  in  moneydemand,  are  there  alternative  plausible  explanations  such  as  that  wedidn't  provide  enough  reserves?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  that's what  I was  trying to  deal  with.Reserves  did  drop  somewhere  around  15  to  18  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Then  interest  rates would  have  had  to  rise.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Or  drop  a  lot  more  to  get  the money  in.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I mean  if  you  didn't  supply  enough money  anddemand was  constant.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  The  other  hypothesis  that  I tried  to  [test]  wasthat  if  the  demand was  weakening  in  any  event  and  if  you  supplied  moremoney,  interest  rates  would  go  down  even  more.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  We've  had  enough  hypotheses.  We will  goand  drink  some  coffee.[Coffee  break]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let  me  express  a  few thoughts  afterlistening  to  this  conversation this  morning,  which  I thought  had  quitea  different  tone  than  a month  ago.  The  big  surge  theory  seems  to  havedisappeared  or  has  strongly dissipated  at  least.  Similarly,  theeconomy has  not  been  expanding  very  rapidly  in  recent  months.  We  hadthat  very  large--and  confusing  to  me--figure  on  employment  in  October.I would  emphasize  one  point  that  a lot  of  people  have  emphasizedalready:  The  impact  of  imports  on  the  manufacturing  sector  of  theeconomy  is  pervasive.  I won't  go  on  at  great  lengths  because  it  wasexplored  earlier.  But  there are  signs  that  what  was  happening  earlierwas  that  the  expansion  in  demand  was  so  great  you  could  knock off  2percent  of  it  for  imports  and  nobody  felt  the  difference.  Now, whendomestic  demand  goes  down,  it  makes  a big  difference.  And  I  guess  theimports  actually have  surged.  You  do  get  a  sense  of  spreading  layoffsamong some  pretty  big  areas  in  manufacturing  industries  right  in  the11/7/8424-middle  of  this  expansion.  You  mentioned  textiles,  shoes,  lumber,  andsome  others.  And  I think  that  affects  the  manufacturers' moodsanyway--not  just  in  terms  of  the  current  competition but  I think  theyare  looking  at  some  of  their  investment  plans.  Some  shoe  businessesare  going  out  of  business,  for  instance.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Textiles  too.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And  it  is  leading to  some  moderationthere.  But  enough  was  said  about  that.  As  I look  at  the  businesspicture,  I think we  have  a  rapid  rate  of  inventory  accumulation.  Thatdidn't  look  so  bad  when  the  economy  was  rising  rapidly,  but  as  soon  asthe  economy  stops  rising  so  rapidly  that  rate  of  inventoryaccumulation has  to  come  down.  One  senses  that  that's  whatbusinessmen  feel.  And  I think  the  short-run  question we  have  is:  Howwill  that  happen?  If  retail  sales  are  strong  in  the  next  few months,we  can  get  a declining  rate  of  inventory  accumulation  in  a very  smoothway  and  have  a  good  setting  for  business  next  year.  If  retail  salesdon't  pick  up  in  the  next  few months,  I think we  have  a quitedifferent  kind  of  problem.  The  GNP  figure  for  the  fourth  quarter  maynot  be  a bit  different  in  total  but  it's  going  to  include  moreinventories  and  less  sales,  and  that  has  quite  different  implicationsfor  next  year.  And  I don't  think we  know.  Everybody  reports  ontalking  to  retailers who  seem  to  change  their  minds  every  two  weeksabout  their  feelings  about  sales--for  good  reason,  I suspect,  becausethere  is  some  instability  in them.  I surely  don't  know, but  if  I hadto  guess  I'd  say  the  retail  sales  figure  in  October  is  probably  goingto  be  weak because  autos  presumably were  down.  The  explanation  thatthere  are  not  enough  cars  [in  dealer  inventories]  is  beginning  to weara little  thin  on me.  Maybe  it's  all  true;  there  is  something  curiousin  that  industry.  I don't  think  the  industry  wants  to  produce  manymore  cars.  I am beginning  to  think they  get  a nice  profit  marginwhere  they  are.  The  dealers  like  it,  manufacturers  like  it,  and  solong  as  they  have  the  Japanese  shut  off why  take  on  another  workerwith  all  the  pension  obligations  and  everything  else?  Although  we'llget  some  expansion  in  production  there,  I guess  it  will  not  be  verymuch.  We  are  in  a period  of  great  uncertainty, particularly  aboutwhat  retail  sales  are  going to  do.  I think  plant  and  equipment[spending]  is  holding up  fairly  well.  I feel  more  comfortable  abouthousing  than  I did  a while  ago  simply  because  interest  rates  are  goingdown.  I would  comment  that  I don't  have any  particular  quarrel  withthe  forecast,  but  I think we  ought  to  put  a  good  deal  of  uncertaintyaround  any  forecast.  I would  point  out  that  the  forecast  level  hasbeen  successively  lowered  in  recent  meetings  at  the  same  time  thatinterest  rates  have been  declining  fairly  precipitously.  We  have  alower  forecast  now for  economic  activity  for  the  next  year  than we  hadin  August  or  in  previous  meetings,  with  interest  rates  2 percentagepoints  lower.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Is  that  right?  I thought  the  level  of  real  GNPat  the  end  of  1985  was  almost  exactly  what  it  was  in  the  previousforecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  No.  I don't  know what  the  previous--

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  It  was,  but  the  near  term--11/7/84-25-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  But  two  forecasts  ago  we  had  a  5 percentincrease  in  the  third-quarter  GNP  and  we're  now  going to  have  1-1/2  to2 percent.  That's  a difference  of  almost  1 percent  [in  level  terms]in  the  estimate  of  one  quarter's  change.  I think  it  was  still  higherin  an  earlier  estimate.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Then  it  has  been  coming  down?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  has  been  coming  down by  whatever  theright  amount  is.  In  a perverse  kind  of  way,  maybe  compared  to  thecomments  that  I heard  from  a  lot  of  people  earlier,  I feel  morecomfortable  about  the  forecast  this  month than  I did  last  month,partly  because  interest  rates  are  down  and  I think  the  housingforecast  is  better  based.  We  have  the  exchange  rate  at  least  movingin  the  other  direction;  we  are  not  under  the  same  pressure.  We  havehad  some--it  is  so  brief  it  is  hard  to  tell--firming of  commodityprices  in  recent  weeks  which  is  quite  in  contrast  to  the  trend  we  hadfor  several  months  prior  to  that.  And we  do  have  that  surprisinglygood  employment  figure  in  services  and  retail  trade  in  October,  whichI don't  understand.Last  month  I saw  no  danger,  frankly,  that  we  could  overeasewithin  the  practical  scope  of whatever  we were  going  to  do.  This  timeI am not  so  sure.  Beginning  at  the  level  of  interest  rates  that  wehave  and  given  the  feeling  I have  about  the  economy,  I could  conceivethat  we  would  get  overly  enthusiastic  in terms  of  easing,  whereas  Ididn't  think that  was  possible  last  month.  In  terms  of  generallyposturing  ourselves,  I think we  are  in  a far  better  position  for  avariety  of  reasons,  given  all  the  risks  that  exist,  to  not  be  too  farbehind  the  curve  in  easing  if  that  is  the  way  things  develop.  That'spartly  because  we  have  the  risks  of  the  dollar;  I would  hate  to  haveto  do  a  lot  of  aggressive  easing  in  a  situation where  the  dollar  isalready  declining more  than  one  would  like  to  see.  I would  rather  bein  a position  where,  if  anything, we  have  the  easing  done  and  are  in  aposition  to  tighten  up  a little  if  the  dollar  does  get  in  real  troubleat  some  point.  But  in  terms  of  our  general  posture,  it's  partly--andthe  point  has  been  made--that  there  is  room,  obviously,  for  theeconomy  to  grow more  than  3 percent  next  year.  I am  talking  about  theprobabilities.The  inflation  picture  looks  under  enough  control  so  that  Idon't  think we  have  to  worry  about  an  explosion  on  that  side  apartfrom  anything  that  would  develop  on  the  exchange  rate  end  itself.  Itis  not  a current  concern but  could  be  a concern  almost  at  any  timelooking to  the  future  depending  upon  how things  develop.  And  giventhe  experience  we  have  had,  I don't  feel  any  great  sense  of  inabilityto  prevent  the  economy  from  bursting  out  on  the  up  side  in  theforeseeable  future.  If  we  had  to  tighten  some  down  the  road,  so  beit.  I don't  have  the  feeling  that  it  would  be  an  impossible  job  tokeep  the  economy  from  an unfortunate  and  overextended  surge  ofactivity  if  we  faced  that  possibility  rather  than  the  opposite  one  ofcumulating  excessive weakness  in  the  economy,  given  all  the  risks  anduncertainties  that  I see.  And  one  factor  I might  mention  in  thatconnection  is  that  in  the  rest  of  the  world  I still  do  not  see  manysigns  of  ebullient  economic  activity,  to  say  the  least.  The  Europeaneconomy  still  seems  to  me  to  be  in  a very  sluggish phase.  I  guess  thelatest  information  from  Japan  is  not  so  bad,  but  it's  on  the  slowerside  rather  than  on  the  stronger  side.  And  that  has  been the  one11/7/84-26-economy  that  has  been  showing  a pretty  good  rate  of  advance.  Theproblems  in  the  developing world  are  obvious  enough.Where  that  all  leaves  us,  I don't  quite  know.  But  I think wewant  to  do.  But  I don't  know  that  we  want  to  go  overboard  about  it.I might  say  that  in  view of  the  monetary  developments,  I think  theonly  question  in  the  past  few weeks  was  whether we  should  have  beeneasier  and  put  in  more  reserves  and  reduced  the  borrowing  level.  Thereason that  was  not  done  was  simply  because  I judged  that  the  tone  ofthe  discussion  and  the  instructions  last  time  clearly  reflected  someconcern  if  interest  rates--and  the  federal  funds  rate  in  particular--were  to  go  down  around  the  10  percent  level  or  below and  other  rateswere  declining  rapidly.  There  wasn't  much  eagerness  for  being veryaggressive,  so  we weren't  very  aggressive.  In  fact,  interest  ratesobviously  did  get  to  those  levels  and  in  those  conditions  it  didn'tseem all  that  urgent.  But  I don't  know that  I personally  had  thefeeling  that  the  interest  rate  developments  were  disastrously  rapid  interms  of  lower  rates,  given  all  the  conditions.  And  I am not  sure  Iwould  want  to  conduct  a  policy  that  I thought  would  actively back  themup  again  as  a deliberate  matter  of  policy.  But  with  that  muchdiscussion,  let  us  proceed.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I would  like  to  propose  that  we  moveto  an  area  between  alternatives A  and  B.  I think  we  get  halfway  thereif  we  only  bring  the  borrowing level  down  to  $600  million.  If  the  fedfunds  rate  is  running  now  at,  say,  9-7/8  percent  on  average  and  wereduce  the  borrowing  level  by  $100  million,  the  rate  is  likely  to  comedown  to  9-1/2  percent  or  a  shade  above.  I think  the  markets  then willexpect  a  discount  rate  cut  at  some  point  following  that;  and  if  thatwere  a  1/2  point  reduction,  that  would  bring  [the  funds  rate]  down  to9 percent.  It  seems  to  me  that  to  go  all  the  way  to  alternative  Bwould  be  a great  mistake.  Therefore,  borrowing  somewhere  in  the  areaof  $600  million  makes  the  most  sense.  We  probably  ought  to  adjust  thefed  funds  range.  I forget  what  it  is  now--8  to  12  percent?  Maybe  weought  to  make  that  7 to  11  percent.  For  the  monetary  target  figures  Iwould  probably  take  numbers  halfway  between the  [A  and  Balternatives].  I don't  have  a clear  view on  M1;  it  seems  to  me  lessreliable than  it  has  at  other  times.  But  the  target  figure  is  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  By  going halfway  in  between you  are  makinga final  judgment  of  1/2  percentage  point  on  a figure  that we  may  comewithin  5 percentage  points  of  if  we  are  lucky.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  We  did  this  past  time;  it  was within  5.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Within  10!

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  I am  pretty  limited  by  10.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I understand.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  That's  all  I have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You mentioned  something  about  reducing  thediscount  rate;  I have  a  comment  on  that.  That  may  be  a market11/7/84-27-expectation,  but  I don't  think  there  is  anything  technical  that  wouldraise  the  question  of  a  decline  in  the  discount  rate  if  the  funds  ratewere  9-1/4  or  9-3/4  percent  or  so.  We  can do  it  if  we  want  to,  but  Idon't  see  any  dynamic  in  the  situation  that  forces  that  decision.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  But  if  the  Board  were  to  take  themove  and  cut  it  by  1/2  point--I'm not  saying that  it  would--the  fedfunds  rate  would  go  down  by  1/2  point  with that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I might  mention:  Somebody  tells  me  thatCitibank  reduced  the  prime  rate  by  1/4  point--a  small  move  on  the  downside,  considering.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  They're  trying  to  influence  thesedeliberations  here!

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  They'll  [unintelligible]  one way  or  the  otherhere.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Martin.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I don't  want  to  put  too  muchemphasis  in  our  discussion  on  M1  in  a  single month,  despite  themagnitude  of  that  surprise  decline  of  7 or  7-1/2  percent--I  thinkthat's what  I heard  Steve  say--in  October.  If  it  carries  over  intothis  month,  though,  I think  it  deserves  some weight  given  that  thereare  so  many  uncertainties  from  the  real  economy  that  we've  all  beensharing  with  one  another  here.  It's  so  difficult  to  forecast  not  onlythe  fourth  quarter  but  the  first  and  second  quarters  of  next  year  whenI think there  is  a high  probability  of  some  difficulties.  Yes,  eventhe  third  quarter  is  still  [uncertain].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let  me  just  say a word  about  that  M1number.  If  I understand  it,  given the  fragmentary information  we  nowhave  for  the  beginning  of  the  month, we would  have  to  get  a bigincrease  in  the  second  week  of  the  month--

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  I realize  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I will  make  an  empirical  comment  that  bigincreases  don't  ordinarily  come  in  the  second week  of  a month.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Even before  these  figures,  we  had  beenforecasting  a  fairly big  increase  in  the  second week  of  the  month.But  that  is  an  unusual  time  for  that  to  occur.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  You have  a 7 percent  projection  for November?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's  what we  had  before  the  very  latestfigures.  I feel  confident  it  will  be  lower  now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.  A figure  that  pulls  down  growth  forthe  month  of  October  at  the  end  of  the  month  by  1 percentage  pointmeans  that  November  is  starting  appreciably  lower  than what  they  wereassuming.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Yes,  the  level  is  roughly  $3-1/2  [billion]lower  than we  were  assuming.11/7/84-28-

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  So  the  7 percent  for  November  in  alternative  A--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It's  not  going  to  happen.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Of  course,  it  is  now way  out  on  the  curvesomewhere.  I take  it  so  is  the  7 percent  in  alternative  B.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  it  is  harder  to  get  those  figures  inif  we  get  some  momentum, it's  not  hard  to  get  a big  one-month  figure.figure  in November.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  If  it  were  a perfect  world--which  it  isn't,  ofcourse--the  ideal  targeting would  be  something  around  the  midpoint  forM1  and  M2.  We're  getting  somewhat  different  information  from M2.as  from  M1.  But  [the  midpoint]  obviously  is  not  a  potential  in  eitherof  the  alternatives  as  regards  what  could be  done  the  rest  of  the  yearand  beginning  in  the  first  quarter  in  terms  of  getting  levels  up  to  apoint  that  would  be  consonant  with  a  reasonable  rate  of  real  growth  inthe  economy.  There  is  no  point  in  belaboring the  lessons  from  thereal  side  of  the  economy.  And  you  are  tired  of hearing me  talk  aboutrisks  in  the  financial  system--in  thrift  institutions,  agriculturalbanks,  and  all  the  rest.  I won't make  my  usual  [comments]  and  take  upyour  time--all  this  overhead  sitting  around  the  room--with  that.  Butstill,  it  seems  to  me  that  we  can  pay  some  more  attention  valuably  tothe  aggregates,  particularly M1  and  M2,  now.  I am not  clear  withregard  to  M3.  The  risk  of  a growth  recession  is  greatly  enhanced  ifM1  is  allowed  to  decelerate  sharply  for  the  whole  fourth  quarter.  Andeven  if  we were  to  set  an  operating  procedure  and  some  short-termtargets  in  which we  overshot  the  midpoint,  I don't  see  under  thesecircumstances--with  inflation  being  under  control,  the  low M1  figurewe  have  had,  and  the  uncertainties  in  the  economy--that  that's  asubstantial  risk.So,  I come  down  for  alternative  A.  Given  what  Steve  and  theChairman  have  just  discussed  with  regard  to  the  growth  of  M1  and  M2for  the  fourth  quarter,  those  are  not  modest  figures  but  they're  along  way  from  getting  us  to  the  midpoint  [of  our  long-run  targets].As  I understand  it,  very  temporarily--hopefully  very  temporarily--theM1  figure  is  almost  at  the  bottom  of  the  range;  it  is  within  $400  to$600  million  of  the  bottom.  So,  it  seems  to  me  that  alternative  Adoesn't  produce  any  kind  of  configuration  vis-a-vis  the  midpoint  ofeither  of  those  two  ranges  to  have  any  implication  of  overstimulationor  the  revival  of  inflation.  Given what  Steve  and  his  colleagues  havelaid  out  here  in  terms  of  borrowing  getting  down  considerably belowTony's  number,  it  seems  to  me  it  would  be well  to  go  for  the  $400  to$500  million  level.  If  that  results  in  a fed  funds  rate  rate  below  9percent  or  in  the  9 to  9-1/2  percent  range,  that  doesn't  seem to  me  aproblem.  It  was  well  said  that  we  don't  know what  the  implicationsare  of  the  decline  in  interest  rates  that  has  already  occurred.  Iagree  with  that.  We  also  don't know  the  implications  of  4 or  maybe  5months  of  decline  in  the  growth  of M1  particularly  and  to  a  lesserdegree  of  M2.  We  don't  know what  the  aggregates  track  will  turn  outto  be  going  into  the  first  quarter,  so  it  seems  to  me  that  we  are  in  aposition  of  being  able  to  change  our  targeting  in  an  accommodativedirection without  any  substantial  risk  of  reigniting  inflationary11/7/84-29-factors.  I say  again,  at  the  risk  of  turning you  all  off,  that  if  afiscal  policy  question  is  going  to  confront  the  nation  early  nextyear,  I would hate  to  see  that  confrontation with  1 percent  realgrowth  and  unemployment heading  for  8 percent  or  something of  thatsort.  I vote  for  "A,"  Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Roberts.

[SECTION]

MR.  ROBERTS.  I would  like  to  reinforce what  Governor Martinsaid.  I think we  are  testing  our  luck by  having  had  no  growth  in M1for  five  months.  And  based  on  our  inability  to  meet  our  past  targetsfor  M1  growth,  I have  no  confidence  that  the  projected  November  andgrowth  instead  of  interest  rates,  which  is  what  I think we  should  havedone.  I think  the  reason  M1  has  not  expanded  is  that  we  have  beenwilling through  our  policy  of  targeting  borrowing  to  resist  thenatural  market  declines  in  interest  rates  that  otherwise  would haveoccurred.  I noticed  that  the  growth  in  total  reserves  and  M1  from  thefourth  quarter  [of  1983]  to  October  are  essentially  the  same,  forexample.  But  in  recent  times  we  have  had  this  precipitous  drop  inreserves.  So  my  view would  be  that  this  is  a time  to  effect  asignificant  easing  and  to  accomplish  a  growth  in  reserves  that  willresult  in  a growth  in money--without  concern  about  the  level  of  marketrates.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would  like  to  make  a comment  onour  operating  procedure.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  events  of  thissummer  uncovered  a  significant  defect  in  our  current  operatingprocedure  in  that,  as  a consequence  of  the  Continental  situation,  thebanks'  borrowing  behavior was  very  much  different  than we  had  assumedat  the  time  of  our  meeting.  They  had  a  propensity to  bid  up  thefederal  funds  rate  rather  than  come  into  the  discount window  and  as  aconsequence we had  a higher  level  of  interest  rates,  which  also  fedinto  long-term bond  yields,  than  the  Committee had  expected  at  thetime  of  the  meeting.  If we  have  an  excessively--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  What  meeting are  you  talking  about?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  it  was  the  July meeting  [or  perhaps]  twomeetings  ago.  You  recall  we  were not  contemplating  a  federal  fundsrate  that  would  go  up  to  the  11-1/2  to  11-3/4  percent  area.  I don'tthink  anyone  around the  table  was  talking  about  that  high  a level.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  My  memory  is  that  that  happened  beforethat  meeting  or  very  close  to  it.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I would  have  to  look  back  and  find  out  whichmeeting  it  was.  But  I think  it  is  clear  that there  was  a meeting  inwhich  as  a consequence  of  this  change  in behavior  we  got  a tighterfederal  funds  market  than  any  member  of  the  Committee  had  talkedabout.  And  it  seems  to  me  that  if  we  have  a slower  economy  than wewant  now,  perhaps  part  of  it  at  least  could  have  been  produced  by  thathigher  level  of  interest  rates  than we  contemplated.  It  seems  to  methat  is  the  fact,  and  there  may be  a  recurrence  of  this  kind  ofsituation in  times  to  come.  I just  wonder  whether  we  shouldn't  takethat  into  account  in  how  we  structure  the  directive.  Since  the11/7/84-30-borrowing  [level]  is  not  a key  factor  in  the  implementation  ofmonetary  policy,  if  that  borrowing  [level]  produces  unexpected  resultsin  interest  rates,  it  seems  to  me  that  perhaps  we  ought  to  have  theCommittee  take  a  look  at  the  situation  by  conference  call  rather  thanjust  staying with  it  and  accepting  whatever  rate  comes  out  of  it.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Frank,  one  of  the  problems was  thatnobody  could  be  sure  how  long  that  unpredictable  behavior was  going tocontinue.  We  didn't  know  how long  that  reluctance  to  borrow wouldcontinue  and  we  certainly  didn't  want  to  take  care  of  it  in  thedirective  because  then  we  would  have  ended  up  [targeting]  the  fedfunds  rate  more narrowly  than  I think--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  After  hearing  the  discussion  last  month,  Iwas  almost  tempted  to  raise  the  question  on  the  agenda:  Do  you wantto  target  the  federal  funds  rate?  That  is  what most  people  seemed  towant  to  do  last  meeting.  I wouldn't  recommend  it,  but  that's--

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  I  recognize  that  there  are  a lot  of  hazards  intargeting  the  federal  funds  rate.  I think the  question  is  whether  weought  to  have  a procedure  under which,  if  the  borrowing  level  isproducing  a significantly  different  level  of  rates  than  the  Committeeexpected,  the  Committee  should  at  least  take  a look  at  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think you're  misreading  this  history  abit,  if  I may  say  so.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  funds  rate  gothigher  than  was  anticipated,  given  any  particular  level  of  borrowings.But  this  happened  over  a period  of  4 or  5 months;  we  had  severalmeetings  when  the  interest  rate  was  higher  than  we  expected  it  to  beand  there was  a deliberate  decision  not  to  do  anything  about  it.  Whenit  first  happened,  the  money  supply was  rising  very  rapidly  in  May  andebullient  forecasts  that  people  weren't  objecting  to  as  to  the  rate  ofeconomic  growth.  So,  under  those  conditions  people  sat  there  andsaid,  rightly  or  wrongly:  "The  interest  rate  is  higher  than  weexpected  it  to  be  but  it  looks  all  right."

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  Sure.  That's  precisely  the  point.  If  it'scoming  from  a strong  economy  and  is  expected,  that's  one  thing.  Ifit's  coming  from a  deviant  behavior  on  the  part  of  the  banks,  that'sanother  thing.  It  seems  to  me  that  our  procedures  ought  to  be  able  todifferentiate  these.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  If  we  can  distinguish.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Well,  the  economy  was  visibly  strong.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know whether  you  have  a particularproposal.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I have  a  proposal  that  we  ask  the  staff  to  takea look  at  this  problem--if  you  agree  that  it  is  one--and  to  design  aproposal  for  dealing with  it  in  the  future.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  is  not  operative  for  today's  meeting?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  No,  I'm  not  talking  about  today's  meeting.11/7/84-31-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  perhaps  we  can  return  to  that  point.

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  Beyond  that,  in  line  with my  previous  comments,I would  prefer  to  stand  back  at  the  moment  with alternative  B until  weget  further  information.  I would  be  perfectly willing to  support  amove  to  a  still  further  lowering of  interest  rates  if  the  incomingevidence  suggests  continued weakening  in  the  economy.  But  it  seems  tome  that  we  ought  to  stop  and  take  a reading  with  respect  to  whatimpact  the  rate  declines  we  have  already  seen  will  have  on  the  economybefore  we  go  further.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How  long  a  time  period  are  you  talkingabout?

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  A  few weeks.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  information  are  we  going  to  get  inthe  next  few weeks?  We  know  roughly what  industrial  production  isgoing to  be.  The  big  information  we're  going  to  get  is  retail  salesfigures;  there's  nothing  else  of  any  significance.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Next  Wednesday we  will  get  the  retail  sales.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Is  there  anything  else?  When  are  durablegoods  orders?  Is  there  anything  else  big  coming  out?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  No.  We have  personal  income  on  November  19th;housing  starts  on  the  20th;  revised  GNP  figures  on  the  20th;  anddurable  goods  orders  on  the  21st,  which  will  be  the  following week.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  So  we  get  retail  sales  and  durable  goodsorders  two  weeks  from now.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  We  are  pretty  sure  that  retail  saleswill  be  somewhat  on  the  weak  side.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think the  retail  sales  figure  isgoing  to  tell  us  much  unless  it  is  quite  strong.  If  it  is,  I wouldthink it  significant.  Myself,  I think  it  is  likely to  be  weak.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And  the  GNP  revision  is  likely  to  be  downward.So  the  first  possible  good-size  plus  number  we  could  get  would  be  ondurable  goods.  That's  hanging  an  awful  lot  on  durable  goods  orders.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  And  if  the  purchasing agents  are  right,  we'renot  going  to  get  a plus  number.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  [Unintelligible]  initial  claims,  basic  commodityprices--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Black.11/7/84

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think  it  is  important  that  we  tryto  get  M1  back  on  a moderate  growth  path  as  quickly  as  we  can.  Unlesssomeone  is  prepared  to  make  pretty  heroic  assumptions  [about]  shiftsin  demands  for  money,  then it  strikes  me  that  a zero  rate  of  growthover  a four-month  period  is  just  about  the maximum  that  we  ought  totolerate.  But  I think we  have  to  be  very  careful  here  and  inparticular  take  account  of  these  lagged  relationships  thattraditionally have  existed  between  short-term  rates  and  M1.  We  havepushed  short-term  rates  down  some  200  basis  points,  and  in  the  pastsuch  a move  usually has  led  to  a very  sharp  spurt  in money  growth.  Itcould  be  that  this  lagged  response  to  the  rate  reductions  we  havealready had  will  produce  a fairly  good  pickup  in M1  in  November  andM1  close  to  the  6  percent  midpoint  at  the  end  of  the  year.  But  at  thesame  time,  we  have  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  actions  we  take  now affectreserve  pressures  over  the  next  few weeks  and  are  going  to  affect  M1in  the  early  part  of next  year.  I  can  see  a danger  that  an  overlydetermined  effort  to  try  to  get  near  that  midpoint  could  start  us  offin  1985  with  an  unacceptably  rapid  rate  of  money  growth.  But  if  youlook  at  the  quarterly  rates  of  growth  in M1  or  the  other  aggregatesfor  1984  and  see  how  much M1  in  particular  has  decelerated,  a fairlyrapid  growth  in  the  first  quarter  of  next  year  would  not  look  all  thatbad  to  me.  The  bottom  line  is  that  I think  our  reactions  should  berather  cautious  and  measured.I  prefer  the  aggregate  outcomes  anticipated  by  "A,"  but  atthe  same  time  I am  not  at  all  sure  that  it's  necessary to  push  theborrowing target  immediately  down  to  $400  million  with whateverreduction  in  the  federal  funds  rate  that  might  imply.  I would  feelmore  comfortable  if we  moved  somewhat  more  slowly with  a higherborrowing target  initially  for  the  next  couple  of weeks  or  so;  if  itbecomes  clear  at  that  point  that  M1  is  still  below  path,  then  I wouldbe  prepared  to  reduce  the  borrowing  target  accordingly.  I would  favor[the  language  in  the  Bluebook under]  alternative  Roman numeral  II  withcertain  changes  in  the  second  sentence  for  the  wording  of  that  and  Istrongly  endorse  Frank  Morris'  suggestion  that  it  really  is  time  forus  to  look  at  our  procedures.  I think  everybody wants  to  get  themoney  supply  growing  again,  but  we  have  no  earthly  idea  how much wewill  have  to  reduce  the  borrowing  target  or  how much the  federal  fundsrate  will  have  to  come  down  to  accomplish  that.  And  I think  thatmeans  that  our  procedures  are  pretty  faulty.  I doubt  that  I would  endup  with  the  same  recommendation as  Frank but  I certainly  do  endorsehis  idea.  In  view  of  all  these  unexpected  things  that  have  happenedthis  year,  our  control  mechanism  leaves  a  lot  to  be  desired  and  Ithink we  can  improve  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Corrigan.

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  From  my  perspective  what  we  have  seen  hereover  the  past  several  weeks,  and  indeed  months,  has  been  somethingthat  I would  consider  an  orderly  adjustment  in  policy  and  interestrates  and  so  on.  There  was  at  least  a fleeting moment  when I thoughtit  might  become  a little  messy  but  that  did  not  materialize.  In  thebroad  context  of  the  situation that  we  are  looking  at,  I would  not  betroubled  if  interest  rates  went  down a  bit  more  in  a context  notunlike what  Tony  spoke  about  earlier.  But  let  me  turn  to  that  in  aminute.  My  view  of  the  economy  is  a  little  different  from manyothers.  That  is  a factor  in  my  thinking.  But  I would  also  caution11/7/84-33-against  too  much  of  a  reaction  to  M1.  We  have  been  through M1problems  and we  are  going  to  go  through  them  again.  It  seems  to  methat  all  of  these  fine  arguments  that  Mr.  Axilrod  and  others  makeabout  M1  really  come  down  to  the  question  of  how many  angels  can  danceon the  head  of  a  pin.  I don't  know how many.  I do  know  that  seasonaladjustment  factors  alone  can make  a big  difference.  We  have  looked  atthese  data  using  a seasonal  adjustment  technique  that's  veryrespectable--I  don't  think  it's  any  better  than  any  others but  it'svery  respectable--and  it  produces  almost  a  $7 billion  increase  in  themoney  supply  from  the  first  week of  June  to  the  second  week of  Octoberrather  than  a decline.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Better  use  that  seasonal,  Mr.  Axilrod!

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  We  need  to  have  several  seasonals  and we  can  usethe  one  that  fits  best!

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  50  seasonals!

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  The  point  isn't  that  any  one  is  better  thanany  other.  The  point  is  that  this  series  is  notoriously  noisy and  wedon't  really understand  it  in  the  short  run,  and  I think  to  pretendthat  we  do  is  a mistake.  The  only  thing we  can be  sure  about  in  termsof  M1  is  that  if  it's  surprising  us  on  the  down  side  right  now, it'sgoing  to  be  surprising us  on  the  up  side  at  some  point  in  the  not  toodistant  future.  So,  while  I recognize  the  very  special  psychologicalif  not  political  significance  of  M1,  I must  say  I would  be  verycautious  about  going  too  far  too  fast  in  response  to  it  even  in  thecontext  of  everything  else  that  is  going on.  My  thoughts  on  specificswould  be  somewhere  between  "A" and  "B." I have  no  great  concern  aboutthe  money specifications  themselves.  Borrowing  of  $550  to  $600million  wouldn't bother  me.  I would  prefer,  at  least  for  now,  toleave  the  federal  funds  range  at  8 to  12  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  no  one  can  take  first  place  away  from mein  recognizing  the  volatility  of  the  M1  numbers.  And  I agree,  Jerry,that  the  best  thing  to  expect  when we  get  a  decline  is  a  rise  in  thenext month.  But  we  have  been  sitting  here  looking  at  surprisinglyweak  numbers  for  quite  a while  and  I think  there  is  a cumulativeeffect  that  most  people  do  feel  has  a significance.  I think enough  ofM1  as  an  indicator  that  I am inclined  to  be  considerably impressed  bythat  or  I presume  that  I am  going  to  be  impressed  by  it  unless  someonegives  me  very  good  evidence  as  to  why  I shouldn't  be.  As  I review  it,M1  has  been  surprisingly weak  over  a period  of  time  and  probablyerratically weak  in  October.  I just  don't  see  how  we  could  have  suchan  economy  that would  produce  a 7-1/2  percent  decline  in money  as  anindication  of the  future.  But  when you  put  it  all  together,  it  doesamount to  quite  a bit.  Because  of  that  and  the  great  damage  thatthat's  going  to  do  us,  as  well  as  what  I said  earlier  about  theeconomy  falling  short  and  having  room for  further  growth,  I would  notbe  opposed  to  alternative  A  as  the  way  to  go.  I think it's  time  for  afairly  pronounced  further  adjustment.  And  it  won't  hurt  us;  I agreewith  Paul  that  if  it  turns  out  to  be  wrong, we  can  tighten  up  a  littlelater  on.11/7/84-34-But  right  now  it  seems  to  me  that  the  risks  are  such that  weought  to  be  guided  to  a degree  by  this  weakness  in  the  M1  numbers.One  advantage  of  a Wednesday  meeting--maybe  it  isn't  an  advantage--isthat  at  least  we  get  the  most  recent  figures  that  way.  And  I wouldpoint  out  that  Steve has  indicated  that  with these  most  recent  figuresit  seems  very  improbable  that  we  could  get  the  M1  specs  of  alternativeA.  So,  we  ought  to  use  something  like  the  specs  of  alternative  Bsince  we  already  have  fallen well  short  of  what  was  put  in  theBluebook  for  us  last  Friday.  I also  think  that  means  we  have  to  go  toa different  kind  of  description  of  our  policy  than  just  a  repetitionof  the  past  one--focusing  on  what  we  would  hope  to  see  and  would  beprepared  to  tolerate  in November-December  following  the  surprisingreasonable  thing  to  be  talking  about.  I would  reduce  the  federalfunds  rate  range  from  8 to  12  percent  to  7 to  11  percent,  as  Tonysuggested;  and  I would  regard  the  midpoint  of  that  range,  9 percent,as  entirely acceptable  for  the  funds  rate.  [On  borrowing],  $400million  seems  a  rather marked  change  in  operational  targeting.  Iwould  put  it  at  $500  million but  I would  not  be  prepared  to  accept  afigure  as  high  as  $600  million,  as  I think Tony  suggested.  It  is  timefor  a  little  "oomph" to  get  into  monetary  policy.  One  final  point:If  in  fact  it  is  true  that  it  is  becoming  the  very  general  view outthere  that  the  inflation  rate  is  going  to  be  much  calmer  than waspreviously  expected,  that,  of  course means  that  nominal  rates  have  todrop  at  least  as  much  as  the  expected  inflation  rate--maybe  a littlemore--in  order  to  offset  the  deflating  effect  of  that  change  inexpectations.  So,  I don't  know that  we  have  gone  too  far  at  all  interms  of  the  indicative  real  rates  that  would  be  associated  with  the

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  given what  I  said  earlierthis  morning,  it's  probably  not  difficult  to  predict  where  I come  out.Of  course,  this  behavior  of  M1  throws  up  some  red  flags  and  doessuggest  a cautionary  attitude.  But  there  are  a couple  of mitigatingfactors  that  I would  like  to  put  on  the  table.  One,  the  debt  numberis  still  relatively  high  and  that  ameliorates  my  concern about  the  M1the  influence  of  the  lower  rates  that  we've  had  in  the  past  severalweeks.  Indeed,  M1  might  still  be  reacting  to  the  higher  rates  that  wehad  during  the  summer.  So,  given  those  lags  and my  view of  theeconomy--which  is  that  it's  basically  coming  down  to  a  sustainablelevel  and we're  going  to  get  some  pickup  in  the  fourth  quarter  andinto  1985  as  suggested  by  the  staff--I  think we  just  ought  to  pause,rest  on  our  oars,  and  let  the  easing  that  has  occurred  filter  throughto  the  economy  and  the  money  supply.  M2  and  M3  are  behaving  quiterespectably  and  I am not  at  all  uncomfortable  with  adopting  a policythat  would  allow M1  to  be  in  the  lower  end  of  the  range  for  thebalance  of  1984.  I would  be  very  cautious  about  continuing  to  easetoo  much or  pushing  too  hard  in  the  direction  of  ease  at  this  point.With  respect  to  the  directive,  I would  prefer  alternative  B,which  as  I interpret  it  is  a status  quo,  wait-and-see  alternative;  andI would  keep  borrowing  at  $700  million with  the  funds  range  where  itis.  As  for  the  directive  [language]  I would  prefer  the  secondalternative  in  the  Bluebook,  although  in  the  second  sentence  of  thatalternative  there  is  reference  to  M1  being  in  the  lower  end  of  the11/7/84-35-range  and  I'm  not  sure  that  it's  necessary  to  flag  that  for  the  publicgenerally.  The  bottom  line  for  me,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  that  I think  wehave  time  and  I would  stay  where we  are.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Gramley.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  Bob has  given my  speech;  I am with him.I would  like  to  suggest  that  there  is  a case  that  we  could  look  at,Chuck, where  the  money numbers  were  giving  us  the  same  kind  ofmisinformation  they  are  now  and  that  was  in  the  late  spring  and  earlysummer  of  1980.  Now, the  situation  was  quite  different.  But we  werelooking at  very,  very  large  declines  in  real  GNP  and  so  we  wereexperiencing weak  growth of  money  because  we  were  moving down  themoney  demand  function.  And  at  the  same  time  the  money  demand  functionwas  dropping  a  ton.  Signs  that  the  economy  was  going  to  come  out  ofrecession were  beginning  to  emerge but  that  was  very  uncertain.  Sowhat  we  did--and  I have  to  say  that  I participated  in  this--is  that wekept  pushing  the  interest  rates  down  far  enough  so  that  finally we  gotthe  money  growth  that  we  had been  contemplating;  but  when we  got  it  wefound  that  the  economy  was  roaring upward.  So  money  growth began  totake  place  at  horrendous  rates  and  we  pushed  interest  rates  way, wayup  again  and  got  involved  in  a  situation  of  volatility  of  money  growthand  of  interest  rates  which  I think was  neither  necessary nordesirable.  Now,  this  is  a totally  different  situation  than  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  You  can  get  whipsawed.  There's  no  questionabout  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Yes,  and  that's  my  point.  I am  optimistic  thatthe  economy  is  going  to  turn  around;  the  signs  of  emerging  strengthare  there.  I am  not  certain,  but  I am  reasonably  confident  thatthat's  going  to  take  place.  I would  not,  therefore, want  to  seeinterest  rates  drop  much  further  from where  they  are  now.  In  thisconnection  I would  note  that  the  staff  forecast  implies  a federalfunds  rate  for  the  end  of  1985  in  the  10-1/4  percent  plus  range  and  ifwe  let  the  rate  drop  too  much  further,  we  are  going  to  be  looking  atthe  need  for  a significant  increase  in  interest  rates  to  keep  both  theeconomy and  money  growth under  reasonable  control.  One  point  I wantto  make  is  a more  or  less  technical  one:  The  staff  has  been  tellingus  that  seasonal borrowing  is  a very,  very  large  part  of  the  totaladjustment  plus  seasonal  borrowing.  I think  the  number  for  theseasonal  component  is  $300  to  $350  million.  If  we  adopted  a borrowingtarget  of  $400  million,  we  are  talking  about  $50  to  $100  million  ofpure  adjustment  borrowing.  I don't  know where  the  federal  funds  rateis  going to  go  but  it  could  go  down  a  lot  further  than  to  the  9percent  number  that  the  staff  is  talking  about.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I would  assume that  we  are  dealing  with  a timewhen  seasonal  borrowing  would  drop.

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  my  thought  would  be  that  some  of  it  woulddrop.  Seasonal  borrowing  is  running  well  ahead  of  where  it  runs  witheven  much more  total  borrowing.  We  don't  know  for  sure  how much  of  itis  going  to  stay  because  it  is  seasonal  or  distress  borrowing  and  howmuch  really  represents  the  response  to  the  rate.  I think  it  will  endup  a little  higher  than  one  would  normally  think  in  any  event.11/7/84-36-

[SECTION]

MR.  ROBERTS.  A  good  part  of  the  seasonal  is  arbitraging thediscount  rate.  That  was  certainly  true  in  my  District.  People  justtook  advantage  of  the  opportunity  and  they  will  stop  doing  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  That  [borrowing]  will  drop.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  The  conduct  of  monetary  policy wouldbe  better,  I think,  with  a mix  of  a  partial  movement  in  the  fed  fundsrate  and  a  cut  in  the  discount  rate  in  order  not  to  get  the  borrowinglevels  too  low.  If  the  borrowing  level  gets  too  low,  I think thereare  complications.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I interrupted  Lyle.  I  really  was  just  thinkingthat  we  are  at  the  time  of  the  year  when we  ought  to  get  a drop  in  theseasonal.  That  is  all.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Well,  that  could  happen.  I think  the  problemswith  the  agricultural  banks  make  it  less  clear  that  most  of  them  havebeen  playing  the  rate  spread  and  that  what  we're  likely  to  see  is  thenormal  seasonal  decline.  In  any  event,  I would  stick with  alternativeB.  If we  wanted  to  shave  the  borrowing  level  down  to  $650  million  orso,  that  would  be  fine.  I would  want  the  federal  funds  rate  to  stickin  the  range  of  9-1/2  percent  plus  or  minus  a little  and  wait  and  seewhat  happens.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Rice.

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  As  has  been  pointed  out  several  times  here,  we'veseen  a good  deal  of  easing  since  the  last  meeting.  As  a matter  offact,  the  easing  is  just  about  the  amount  that  I had  hoped  for  at  thelast  meeting,  so  what  has  been  taking  place  in  the  easing  of  policy  isgetting  very  close  to  my  comfort  level.  I think  it  is  important  notto  allow  short-term  interest  rates  to  fall  too  far  too  fast.  In  thissense,  I  share  Bob  Black's  feeling  of  the  need  for  some  caution  in  therate  at  which we  ease  policy.  Having  said  that,  I think we  have  to  dobetter  than  alternative  B.  I would hope  for  something  between  "A"  andI would be  very"B"  and  I am  not  uncomfortable  as  we  move  toward  "A." happy  to  go  along with  Tony  Solomon's  recommendation  of borrowing  at$600  million  and  adjusting  the  fed  funds  rate  range  down to  7 to  11percent  and  hope  that  the  aggregates  show  some  improvement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  In  view  of  what  I perceive  to  be  the  weak  spotsin  business  that  could  be  spreading  rather  than  about  to  improve,  andgiven the  sustained  undershoot  in  M1  since  the  middle  of  the  year,  Iam  getting  quite  concerned  about  that  problem.  The well  knownvolatility  of  M1  on  a monthly  basis  begins  to  wash  out  when  it  has  hada weak  performance  for  four  months.  I take  no  comfort  in  the  factthat  M2  has  been  rising  steadily  because  it  did  so  preceding  the  lastmajor  recession that  we  had.  I would  be  ready  to  err  on  the  side  ofease  for  a while  and  if  that  proves  to  be  too  much,  we  can  alwayscorrect  it  later.  By  and  large  the  one  alternative  that  to  me  atleast  would  be  unwise  is  alternative  B,  since  that  anticipates  aborrowing  level  of  $700  million  and  an  expected  federal  funds  rate  of10  percent.  In  sum,  I would  be  happy  to  see  alternative  A  or  possiblyAnd  if we  were  to  go  for  "A,"  I would  behalfway between  "A"  and  "B." a  little  cautious  in  going  down  to  a borrowing  level  as  low  as  $40011/7/84-37-million  right  away;  I would  prefer  to  start  at  about  $500  million  formuch the  same  reasons  Governor  Partee  has  already  set  forth.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  On  cyclical  grounds,  I really find  it  very  hardto  make  an  argument  for  any  kind  of  easing.  I see  the  risks  of  makingthe  same  old  mistake  of  easing  in  the  latter  stages  of  an expansion.But  the  discussion  of  M1  may  provide  a justification  for  how I canperhaps  get  myself  off  the  hook  of  being--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I didn't  know we  had  that  problem  ofeasing  too  late  in  an  expansion.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I think  that  has  been  what  has  often happened.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  We  always  got  accused  of  the  opposite.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Cyclically,  I see--maybe  it's  inadequatetightening.  But  your  remark,  Mr.  Chairman, that  if we  overshoot  onthe  down  side  we  could  catch  it  again  and  tighten,  does  encourage  me  alittle  in  a different  interpretation  of  the  situation.  We  obviouslyhave  very high  real  interest  rates.  As  Chuck  said,  each  timeinflation  expectations  come  down  real  interest  rates  go  up.  Over  timewe  have  to  bring  these  down.  The  main way  of  bringing  them  down  is  toreduce  the  budget  deficit.  But  I think  it  also  has  something  to  dowith monetary  policy  in  the  sense  that  there  isn't  enough money  in  theeconomy  to  allow interest  rates  to  be  lower.  Now, the  difficulty  isgetting  that  money  into  the  economy without  going  to  a  very highgrowth  rate  of  the  aggregates--which  looks  terrible,  sends  the  wrongsignal,  and may  never  be  caught  up  with  and  never  be  stopped.  Whenyou  have  a temporary  reduction  in  demand  for  M1,  or  maybe  a permanentreduction,  that  does  provide  an  opportunity  without  seeming  to  gun  theaggregates  to  increase  the  amount  of  money  in  the  economy  in  a limitedway  and  thereby  put  pressure  on  real  rates.  So,  with  that  analysis,  Icould  go  somewhere  between  "A"  and  "B." I think  $600  million  would  bethe  maximum,  given  the  danger  that  borrowing  could  become  too  low andthe  funds  rate  might be  destabilized.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  [You  mean]  $600  million  would  be  theminimum.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's  as  far  as  you would  go?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  That  would  be  as  far  as  I would want  to  go.And  for  the  funds  rate  range,  if  this  is  an  effort to  bring  rates  downby  increasing  the  stock  of  money  and  not  the  rate  of  growth  of  moneyin  the  economy,  7 to  11  percent  would  be  acceptable.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Although  there  is  some  uncertainty  as  to  wherethe  economy  is  going,  from the  earlier  comments  it  does  seem to  methat  on  balance  the  tone  has  changed  very  substantially  from our  pastmeeting and  that  we  are  in  an  environment where  some  easing  is  areasonable  expectation.  I wouldn't  make  too  much  of  the M1  number  forone  month  but,  as  has  been  pointed  out,  this  [weakness]  has  beenpersisting  for  some  period  of  time  now  and  just  maybe  it's  telling  us11/7/84-38-something.  I would  not  in  turn  overreact,  but  as  I look  at  the  dotson  the  charts  it  seems  to  me  that  neither  alternative  A  noralternative  B  is  an  overreaction.  Rather,  I would  think  we  ought  tobe  aiming  toward  the  middle  of  the  range  over  a longer  period  of  timeas  we  look  into  the  next  year.  And  that  leads  me  to  alternative  A.  Iwould  reduce  the  federal  funds  range  to  recognize  a  reduction  that  hastaken  place  in  the  market--not  so  much  because  I  think that  7 percentwould  be  an  operative  rate.  But  if  the  federal  funds  rate  were  to  getback  into  the  11  percent  area  with  any  persistence,  I certainly thinkthat  would  be  an  opportunity  for  a  telephone  call.  With  regard  to  theborrowings,  I think  going  down  to  the  level  suggested  in  the  Bluebookunder  alternative  A  is  pretty  severe;  therefore,  I would  think aborrowing  level  of,  say,  $500  to  $550  million would  be  appropriate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Seger.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  I am  voting  for  alternative  A  for  two  basicreasons.  One,  of  course,  is  what  I see  as  the  slowing  in  the  economyand  the  sobering  of  the  moods  out  there  in  the  business  world.Secondly,  although  I am  not  obsessed with what  happens  to  M1,  I amdepressed  with what  has  happened  to  M1  growth  in  the  four  months  fromthe  final  quarter  this  year  does  not  look  like  red  hot  growth.  Also,looking  at  M2,  whose  expected  growth  in  the  fourth  quarter  is  7-1/2percent,  which would be  the  midpoint  of  the  long-term  range,  thatdoesn't  seem  excessive  either.  And  then  getting  to  where  this  wouldput  us  at  year-end, we  would  be  below the  midpoint  though  within  thelong-term  ranges  for  both  M1  and  M2.  So,  this  doesn't  strike  me  aseasing  irresponsibly.  Also,  when  I look  at  the  reserve  figures,  I amnot  surprised  that  monetary  growth was  as  slow as  it  was  in  October.I guess  I am  surprised  it  wasn't  slower when  I  see  the  dive  innonborrowed  reserves  and  total  reserves.  So,  I would  vote  foralternative  A.  In  terms  of  the  directive,  I would  use  the  number  IIalternative.  I don't  feel  that  the  relationship  between  borrowing andthe  fed  funds  rate  is  clear  enough  to  me  to  know what  kind  ofborrowing  numbers  would  come  through.  It  seems  to  me  this  is  somewhatof  a crap  shoot;  there  is  obviously  a number  out  there  some  place  thatis  the  right  one,  whatever  that  is,  and  it  will  give  us  fed  funds  inthe  range  of  7 to  11  percent  and  would  satisfy  me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mrs.  Horn.

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  In  my opinion  the  pause  in the  economy  and  severalmonths  of  flatness  in  the  money  supply  argue  for  active  support  ofgrowth  in  the  money  supply.  Both  "A"  and  "B"  accept  a shortfall  inmoney,  which  I favor,  but  of  the  two  I would  favor  moving  towardalternative  A.  I would  like  to  see  that  kind  of  growth  rate  inI wouldn't  want  to  jump  to  a  $400  million borrowing  level.  And  as  wetest  borrowing  levels  below  $700  million,  I would  like  to  see  a  9percent  plus  federal  funds  rate  and  something  around  9 percenttriggering  a call.  I am  assuming  something  quite  far  towardalternative  A.  In  that  assumption  I assume  no  change  in  the  discountrate.  I am  sympathetic  with the  people who  have  said  that  we  havecome  a  long way  with  regard  to  interest  rates;  they  are  downconsiderably  and  we  ought  to  wait  and  see  [the  impact  of]  what  we  havealready  done.  In  addition,  I  still  believe  that  the  long-termunderlying  problem  in  the  economy,  and  our  top  priority,  is  inflation.11/7/84-39-So,  if  we  adopt  something toward  alternative  A,  we  may have  to  reverseour  actions  if  the  recovery  comes  on  as  strongly  as  I think  it  mightor  if  the  growth  in  money  resumes.  But  I prefer  to  take  the  risk  ofthe  reversal  to  the  risk  of  waiting.  That's  where  I come  out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  With  respect  to  thedifference  between  alternatives  A  and  B,  given  the  money  numbers  thatwe  have  looked  at,  clearly  a move  to  alternative A would  suggest  somefurther  easing  immediately  after  this  meeting.  We  don't  have  a  lot  ofhope,  judging  from  the  comments  around  the  table  and  from  the  staff,that  we  will  reach  the  level  of  money  growth  that  is  incorporated  inalternative  B;  therefore,  if  we  move  to  alternative A,  we  are  going  tobe  easing  more  aggressively  immediately  after  this  meeting.  Thesecond  point  is  that  in  accordance  with  the  staff's  projection,alternative  B  suggests  a federal  funds  rate  in  the  neighborhood  of  10percent  with  a  $700  million  borrowing  level.  I think  there  is  fairlygood  evidence  that  there  has  been  some  shift  in  the  demand  forborrowing  and,  therefore,  the  relationship  between  the  borrowing  leveland  the  federal  funds  rate  is  perhaps  less  precise  than  in  the  past.Let  me  just  make  two  points  in  that  regard.  One  is  that,  clearly,  theunwillingness  of  large banks  to  borrow following  the  Continentalsituation has  reversed  itself.  They  don't  seem  to  be  experiencingthat  unwillingness  and  as  a result  have  come  back  to  the  discountwindow.  The  second  and  more  important  thing  is  what  Lyle  Gramley hasspoken  of  and  that  is  the  relationship  of  the  borrowing  level  to  thefederal  funds  rate  when you  incorporate  seasonal  borrowing  into  thatborrowing  level.  Traditionally,  seasonal  borrowing  has  commencedgrowing  around  the  first  of  the year,  grows  through August,  and  thenthat  pattern  did  hold,  but  at  a much higher  level.  Seasonal borrowinghas  been much  higher  than  in  the  past.  And  there  has  been  little  orno  decline  from  August  forward,  as  we  would have  experienced  in  thepast.  We're  now  in  the  $300  to  $325  million  range  for  seasonalborrowing;  if  you consider  that  that  has  become  less  sensitive  tointerest  rates,  there  is  very  little  room.  If  you  take  that  away  fromthe  total  borrowing  level  of  $700  million, we  are  at  a frictionallevel,  it  seems  to  me;  adjustment  borrowing  would  be  virtuallynonexistent  if  we  go  to  the  $400  million  level  and  at  the  frictionallevel  if  we  remain  at  the  [current]  level.The  conclusion  that  I would  draw  from  all  of  this  is  that  Iwould  opt  for  alternative  B because  we  don't  know what  relationshipswill  come  to  pass  as  the  result  of  the  interest  rate  drops  that  havealready  taken place.  I would  consider  those  fairly  aggressive--1-1/2to  2 percentage  points  over  the  last  five  weeks.  Secondly,  I wouldalso  anticipate  that  if  we  adopted  "B" as  specified  in  the  Bluebookwith  a  $700  million  level  of  borrowing, we  would  see  some  furthereasing  in  interest  rate  levels,  maybe  to  the  9,  9-1/4  or  9-1/2  percentarea.  It  would  seem  quite  appropriate  to  me  that  we  get  to  that  9 to9-1/2  percent  area,  but  I think  we  can  achieve  it  with  a  $700  millionborrowing  level.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Why  do  you  say  that,  Roger?

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Simply because  a good  part  of  the  seasonal  isinelastic  now  or  unresponsive to  interest  rate  levels,  which  I think11/7/84-40-the  record would  reflect.  Then you're  really  operating  on  a borrowingfunction  of  something  in  the  neighborhood  of  $400  million  and  that  iscloser  to  a  9 percent  federal  funds  rate  than  a 9-1/2  percent  rate,  assuggested  by  the  Bluebook.  Alternative  A would  get  you there  with  a$400  million  borrowing  level.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Well,  I agree  with  you  on  the  $400million.  I am  just  a little  surprised  that  you  said  to  continue  the$700  million  level would  bring  fed  funds  down  to  about  9-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I think  fed  funds  right  now  are  probably  at  the9-1/2  percent  level  or  thereabouts.  If  we  don't  do  anything,  I thinkwe  will  see  them  come  on  down  to  that  level.  The  last  point  I want  tomake  is  that  if  I were  running  policy  by  my own  prescription,  I wouldrather  take  "B" and  a $700  million  borrowing level  for  the  reasons  Ihave  just  expressed--expecting  fed  funds  to  come  down  to  the  9-1/2percent  area.  Then,  if  we  saw  a need  for  further  easing,  I would  doit  with  a discount  rate  decrease  rather  than  letting  the  fed  fundsrate  run down  to  9 percent  or  maybe  even  below  9 percent  and  thenmaking  a  1/4  or  1/2  point  cut  in  the  discount  rate,  which could  push[rates]  down  to  a level  that  I would  not  want  to  see  occur.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  May  I just  ask Roger  a question?

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Roger,  I've  never  looked  all  that  closely  atthese  seasonal  borrowing  arrangements.  Do  they  have  a terminal  date?

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Yes,  there  should  be  a terminal  date  on  seasonalborrowing;  it  can  run  out  as  far  as  11  months,  Chuck.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And  you  said  it  started  in  April?

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Historically,  such  borrowings  start  at  the  firstof  the  year.  Just  to  give  you  the  figures  from  '81  to  '83:  Onaverage,  they  would  go  up  to  a  $250  million  peak  level  in  July  andthen  decline back  down  to  about  $60  million  in  December.  The  patternthis  year  was  that  they  started  out  at  about  $80  million in  January,progressed  up  to  a  $350  million  peak  in  August  and  are  currently  inthe  $310  to  $325  million  range;  we  don't  see  that  falloff  in  the  lasthalf  of  the  year.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That  was why  I asked  that  question.  I  justwondered  whether  there would  come  a point  where  you would  want  toclean  up  and  call  them  off  and  say  the  year  is  over.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  If  you  consider  that  it  is  inelastic  and  thatthere  has  been  a shift  in  demand  for  borrowing,  then  those banks  thatrun  out  of  their  seasonal  privilege  are  going  to  come  back  in  foradjustment  credit  or  they  are  going  to  be  illiquid.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Then  it  will  be  adjustment  credit  at  that  point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I came  into  this  meeting with  a lot  ofuncertainty  about  the  economy  and  the  outlook  and,  as  it  draws  to  a11/7/84-41-close,  I really  don't  feel  as  though  I have  been  overwhelmed by  anabundance  of  clear  vision.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  clearest  vision we  may have  is  thatwe're  uncertain.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I think we  are  all  pretty  much  in  the  same  boatof  uncertainty.  It  really  comes  down,  then,  to  how  you  postureyourself when  you aren't  sure  and  where  you  have  more  room  for  error.I think there  is  considerably more  room for  error  on  the  expansionside  than  on  the  slowdown  side.  So,  for  all  the  reasons  that  havebeen  given  in  support  of  that  position,  I come  down  on  the  side  ofalternative A.  I think  it  is  easier  to  undo  a mistake  on  thestimulative  side  at  this  point  than  to  undo  a mistake  of  not  beingstimulative  enough.  I do  think  $400  million on  borrowing  is  a  littlelow;  $500  million makes  sense  to  me.  Initially, my  main  concern  isthat  it  is  a  long  time  between  now and  the  next  meeting.  If  we  tackon  to  the  four  months  or  so  of  slow  growth  in  the  economy  and  slowgrowth  of  the  money  supply,  we  could  end  up  with  six months  of  thewrong  kinds  of  numbers.  I am  not  a  great  fan  of  money but  I think  itdoes  tell  us  something  when  it  begins  to  cumulate  like  this.  So,  Ithink we  ought  to  be  awfully  careful  as  we  go  through the  intermeetingperiod.  And  if  it  turns  out  that  the  incoming  figures  on  the  economyare  weaker  and  money  continues  to  be  weak  and  we  don't  have  any  reallygood  reasons  to  explain  it  other  than  a weak  economy,  then  I think  weof  the  year.  I don't  have  strong  feelings  on  the  directive  language;I have  a slight  preference  for  alternative  I.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Boykin.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOYKIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  as  I indicated  a  little  earlier,my  view  of  the  economic  outlook  is  not  quite  as  pessimistic  as  some.I find  myself  in  a dilemma because  I find  myself  agreeing with  thelast  speaker  regardless  of  what  he  has  said!  Intuitively,  theuncertainty  that  we  all  share,  which  is  obvious,  tells  me  that  weshouldn't  do  very much  that  is  different  from what we  are  doing  atthis  point.  I  really agreed  with  Karen  Horn's  description of  thesituation  except  that  I come  to  a different  conclusion  about  what  todo  about  it.  I would  remain  where we  are,  alternative  B asprescribed,  and  then  as  events  unfold  move  to  a little  more  ease  ifnecessary  as  opposed  to  going  the  other  way  to  a bit  more  ease  now  inthe  recognition that  we  could  move  policy  back.  I would  not  go  thatway.  On  the  borrowing  assumption, however,  I would  not  feel  asstrongly  that  it  has  to  remain  at  $700  million.  I rather  agree  withRoger:  Alternative  B as  prescribed  but  with  an  initial  borrowingassumption  of  $600  million  would  be  all  right  with me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Since  I have  not  looked  at  thesedirectives  very  closely,  the  first  one  is  just  like  last  time,  right?We would  have  to  put  in  different  numbers.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  We  are  going  to  have  to  put  in  a  lower  Ml.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I ordinarily have  a  strong bias  toward  notchanging these  directives  in  mid-quarter,  but  this  time  we  are  so  faroff  on  M1  that  maybe  it  would  be  better  to  change  the  whole  thing  thanto  put  in  a funny  number,  which  leads  me  to  alternative  II.  A  number11/7/84-42-of  people,  but  not  everybody,  mentioned  II.  Let me  ask whether  weshould  work  from  II.  I am  not  saying  every  dot  and  tittle  of  it,  butthe  difference  is  that  it  involves  saying  something  special  about  M1.That's  the  substance  of  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  I see  a  case  for  alternative  I because  I don'tthink we  want  to  show  a very  high  rate  of  money  growth.  If  we  do  easesome,  we  would  be  doing  enough.  I don't  think  one  would  want  tosignal  on  top  of  that  that  something  is  being  done  that  is  reallyirrelevant  [to  our  decisions],  which  is  the  sense  [of  the  difference]between  alternative  I and  alternative  II.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  I am  a little  concerned  also  aboutthe  market  speculating  as  to  why we  gave  two-month  instead  of  three-month  growth  rates.  A  lot  of  [market  observers]  will  presume  thereare  reasons;  and  if  so,  I wonder  if  they're  worthy  ones.  If  thenumbers  add  up  to  what  they  add  up  to,  then  I  don't  see  why we  shouldput  ourselves  in the  position  of  treating M1  specially  in  order  tocome  up  with  a higher-sounding  number  when anybody who  really  is  a Fedwatcher  is  going to  know  exactly what  it  will  mean  and  that  it  willsay  the  same  thing  for  the  quarter  as  a whole.  I have  a mildpreference  for  alternative  I.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I have  not  really  examined  this  closelybut  the  thought  just  occurred  to  me:  Suppose  we  combine  alternative  Iand  II  and  avoid the  two-month  number.  It  may  be  a bad  precedentsince  we  haven't  the  vaguest  idea  whether we  are  going  to  come  closeto  it  for  two  months  and  part  of  the  two  months  is  already over.  Butsuppose  we  said  something  like:  "This  action  is  expected  to  beconsistent  with  growth  of  M2  and  M3"  at  whatever  [rates  we  decide].Those  rates  are  not  changed  in  substance  or  even  not  changed  at  all.put  in  a  special  sentence  about  M1. in  October  it  is  anticipated  that  the  quarterly  figure  would  be"--whatever.  And  then  maybe we  should  pick  up  this  part  "More  rapidgrowth would  be  acceptable  in  M1  in  view of  the  substantial  decline  ofM1  in  October  which  brought  that  aggregate  in  the  bottom half  of  itslong-term  range."  Or  we  could  leave  that  last  part  off.  Maybe  that'sthe  way  to  do  it:  Just  put  in  a quarterly  figure  and  a  sentence  on  M1and  then  say,  just  as  you  say  here,  that  more  rapid  growth would  beacceptable  in  view of  the  substantial  decline.  Make  that  the  thirdsentence  of  alternative  I."In  view  of  the  shortfall  in M1

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  My  objection  to  leaving  it  the  way  it  is  isthis:  It  seems  to  me  that  either we  make  a mockery  of  having  hadtargets  or  we  have  to  ease  an  awfully  lot  more  to  get  growth  up  to  6percent.  How can  you  reduce  it  from  6 percent  to  2-1/2  percent  justbecause  you  have  had  a bad  month?  Paul's  way  of  dealing with  that  atleast makes  it  understandable,  I think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  At  least  we  are  admitting--

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  But  the  number  that  we will  put  in  there  withthat  change  will be  something  in  the  neighborhood of  1-1/2  to  2percent  for  M1  growth  in  the  fourth  quarter.11/7/84-43-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  will  be  pretty  small.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  think  it  is  going  to  changewhatever we  put  in  anyway.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  That  is  the  reason  I would  opt  for  alternativeII,  so  we  don't  have  to  deal  with  it  in  mid-quarter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I presumed we  were  going  to  put  in  2-1/2to  3-1/2  percent  or  compromise  between  them  and  put  in  3 percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  alternative  II  is  only  focused  on  the  twomonths  for  M1.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I know, but  I presume  that's  the  same  assome  quarterly figure.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  it's  2-1/2  or  3-1/2  percent,  depending  on--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it's  going  to  take  1/2  percentbigger  growth  for  the  two  months  because  we  are  one  percent  lower  in

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  So  we  can't  really  put  in  more  than  3 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Three  is  a nice  round  number  and  thatimplies  a little  over  seven  percent,  I take  it,  for  November-December.I don't  even  know what  you  have.  What  are  you intending  to  put  inhere  on  the  two  alternatives?  You  said  7 percent  for  "B." it  for  "A"?What  was

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  "A"  had  8-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [Unintelligible.]  So,  it  is  8 or  8-1/2percent,  I guess.  For  "B"  you had  7 percent  and  for  "A" you had  8-1/2percent  and  it  is  starting  out  a little  low  so  that  adds  another  1/2percent.  So  you would  have  7-1/2  [and]  9 percent  for  those  twomonths.  If  we  put  in  3 percent--if  I'm  doing this  arithmetic  right--that  implies  8 to  8-1/2  percent  for--

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Something more--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  3-1/2  percent  presumably  implies  9percent.  If  my  arithmetic  is  right,  it  comes  out  about  8-1/4  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  it's  about  8-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  that's  right;  you  need  8-1/4  percent  for

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  our  numbers  are  3-1/2  percent  for

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  With  the  new  October  figure?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  No,  I am  sorry.  That's  with the  old  October[unintelligible].11/7/84-44-

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  you  haven't written  offalternative  II  altogether,  I think  you  can  do  essentially  that  samething  fairly  easily  if  you  change  the  second  sentence  right  after  thesemi-colon  and  say  something  like  "which would  partly  offset  theunanticipated  decline  in  October."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  There  isn't  that  much  difference  betweenthese  two  [alternatives].  The  only  difference  is  that  one  sentencereally.  It's  a question  of  whether we  state  it  as  a quarterly  figureor  as  a  two-month figure.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  That's  exactly  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  The  rest  of  this  is  all  open.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Well,  not  only have  we  used  quarterlyfigures  but,  as  I  said  before,  Fed  watchers  are  going to  come  out  withthe  same  arithmetic.  Thirdly,  if  we  do  fall  short  of  this  8 to  9percent  growth  in  November  and  December--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I don't  know how you  got  that  figure.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  --it  clearly  makes  it  even  fairlyobvious  to  non-Fed watchers  and  casual  Fed  watchers  that  there  wasthis  enormous  shortfall.  I just  don't  see  why we  want  to  play  aroundwith moving away  from  the  quarterly  numbers.  The minute  we  do  thatthey  are  really  going  to  take  out  their  pencils  and  do  all  thearithmetic.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I think  the  only  issue  here, which  is  nota  substantive  issue  but  a cosmetic  issue,  is  precisely  that:  whetherwe  want  to  cite  a two-month  number--whether  that's  a  good  policy  onbalance  or  not.  I have  some  sympathy  for  saying  it's  not.  We'vepretty  consistently used  quarterly  numbers.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  We  don't  have  any  real  reason  for  the  shortfallsand  how  to  read  them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I  guess  I am  saying  that  we  might  as  wellstick with the  quarterly  figure.  In either  event,  I would  make  aspecial  sentence  about  M1  and  say  whatever  we  want  to  say  about  ashortfall  in  it.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Let  me  ask  a minor  question,  Steve.If  my  recall  is  correct,  and  it  probably  isn't,  didn't  we  always  usethe  word  "reduce"  rather  than  "decrease"  existing pressures  on  reservepositions?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Oh  heavens,  I don't  remember.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  You  think  there's  a difference?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Yes.  People  are  going to  wonder  why.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  I can't  imagine  that  they  will.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  But  am  I correct  that  we  always  used"reduce"?11/7/84-45-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I don't  know.  I can  check.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  let  me  try  to  resolve  the  problem wehave here  and  then  we  can  come  back  and  try  to  write  something.Again,  I don't  think there  is  a substantive  difference.  After  "Thisaction  is  expected  to  be  consistent  with  growth  of  M2  and  M3"  whydon't  we  put  in  the  same  figures  we  had  before.  We're within  a halfpercent  of  them,  aren't  we?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let's  say  "growth  of  M2  and  M3  at  annualrates  of  7-1/2  and  9 percent."  All  right?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  That  is,  we  are  projecting to  be  within  that;we  are  not  actually--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  do  you mean?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  the  October  figures  are  quite  different:6 percent  for  M2  and  10  percent  or  so  for  M3.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  still  a reasonable  target,  right?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  that's  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Shall  we  stick  a phrase  at  the  end  of  thatsuch  as  "as  indicated  at  the  last  meeting"  or  something  like  that?Then  go  with  another  sentence  on  M1?  Well,  maybe we  don't  need  that"as  indicated  at  the  last  meeting."

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  You  could  say  "continue  to  be  consistent."

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Except  we're  changing  the  specifications,though.  So,  "continue  to  be  consistent"--

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  No  matter  what  we  do,  they  are  going  to  grow  atthose  rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "M1  is  expected  to  grow over  the  periodby" whatever.  Let's  say  3 percent  tentatively,  which  is  halfwaybetween  and  a  round  number.  We  could  just  put  a semi-colon  and  thensay  "more  rapid  growth would  be  acceptable  in  view of  the  substantialover  the  period  by  3 percent,  less  than  anticipated earlier  in  view  ofthe  shortfall  in  October."

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's  better.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  What  period  are we  speaking  of?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  From  September.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Oh,  September  to  December.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And  then we  could  go  on  to  say  "In  thelight  of  that  shortfall,  more  rapid  growth in  that  aggregate would  beacceptable."11/7/84-46-

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Do  you  want  to  say  "In  view  of thenegative  number  in  October"  rather  than  "the  shortfall"?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  "decline  in  October"  is  all  right.Then we're  going  to  say  more  generally  "Lesser  restraint  on  reservepositions would  be  acceptable  in  the  event  of  significantly  slowergrowth  in  the  monetary  aggregates."  I  sure  don't  know whether we  needthat  greater  restraint  sentence.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  The  whole  thing  starts  out  with  "decreasesomewhat."  I wonder  whether we  want  the  "somewhat."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let's  get  to  that  point.  Is  that  generalframework  of  the  directive--just  in terms  of  the  language--all  right?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Mind  over  matter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let  me  take  the  funds  rate  first;  thatseems  to  be  easier.  Most  people  have  said  7 to  11  percent,  whichmakes  sense  to  me.  It's  more  centered  and  we  raised  it  not  so  longago.  I think  after  all  this  period  of  time  it  might  be  appropriate  tohave  some  gesture  toward  reducing  it.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  It's  a  lucky  number.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Generally,  we  are  at  7 to  11  percent?

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  I  guess  so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  critical  figure  will  be  the borrowingassumption.  There we  are  dealing  with a  great  deal  of  uncertainty.  Ithink  all  these  comments  about  the  seasonal  borrowing are  relevant  butalso  I suppose  it's  possible  that  the  seasonal  borrowing  will  decreasenow  that  market  rates  are  so  low.  We  had  an  experience  recently witha big bank waltzing  in  for  a large  amount  of  borrowing  for  no  apparentreason.  And  if  one  or  two  big  banks waltz  in  during  a reserve  period,that  uses  up  all  our  borrowing  here  and  we're  left  in  a  peculiarposition.  We  have  a full  range  of  proposals  here--from  $400  or  closeto  it  to  $700  million,  which  averages  to  $550  million.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  You may  have  two  groups  of  dissentingvotes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I do  think  there  is  some  danger  in  easingtoo  aggressively here.  I don't  think  that  analogy  in  '80  is  aterribly  good  one  to  give  because we  had  those  credit  controls  andother  factors  that  were  driving down  M1.  But  we  have  had  a  prettygood  decline  in  interest  rates.  I personally  feel  a  little  morecomfortable  about  the  outlook  simply because  interest  rates  havebe  the  prevailing  sentiment.  What  anything means  I don't  know.  As  apractical matter,  I take  it  nobody  would  be  very  happy  at  this  stage,contrary to  a few weeks  ago,  to  see  the  rates  backing  up  appreciablyin  the  market;  the  bill  rate  can  go  up  a  little  from  where  it  is  todayand  so  forth.  But  I don't  know what borrowing  level  providesassurance  against  that.11/7/84

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  I'm afraid  that  at  $700  million  theremight  very well  be  some  backing up.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I agree  with that.  We  don't  know  that,but  I would  agree  that  the  odds  are  substantial  in  that  case.  Itcould  happen with  $600  million but  that  is  less  likely,  depending  uponwhere  you  think  it  is  now.  Driving  it  down  to  $500  million  seems  tome  a bigger  step  than  is  appropriate  at  the  moment.  Maybe  it  will  beappropriate  in  a few weeks.  My  view  is  that  that  could  put  the  fundsrate  at  8-1/2  percent,  given--

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  If  we  have  a volatile--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I thought we  had  a staff  projection that  $400million would  be  consistent with  9 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Yes,  that  $400  million would be  9 percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  We  think  that  borrowing  of  $400  million  willkeep  the  funds  rate  slightly  above  the  discount  rate.  And  it  might  gobelow  that;  I don't  think  it  will.  A  lot  depends  on  how we  manageoperations  and  the  signals  given.  In  general,  that's  probably  right.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  But,  if  the  markets  think  that  we'regoing  to  be  easing  aggressively, they will  go  even  further,  Chuck.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  They  probably  won't  cut  it  much below thediscount  rate.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  I ought  to  add  a caveat,  Governor  Partee.With  this  two-week  reserve  period what  President  Solomon  mentioned  isperfectly right.  If  we  have  to  push  reserves  in  aggressively to  getthe  borrowings  down  or  if  some big  bank  comes  in  early  and  creates  alot  of  excess  reserves  and  the  funds  rate  tends  to  go  down,anticipations  of  a discount  rate  decrease will  come  into  play  and  theactual  funds  rate  may  actually  fall  below the  present  discount  rate.Now,  I can't  imagine  that  the  borrowing will  be  particularly  high  inthose  circumstances,  but  there  is  some  give  there.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  would  be  pretty  eccentric  to  have  the  fundsrate  much  below the  discount  rate.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Yes,  not  for  any  sustained  period.  But  it  hasbeen  for  a few  days;  it  was  on  Monday  and  Tuesday.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Maybe we  just  ought  to  provide  some  reserves  andforget  about  this  borrowing number.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  could  do  that,  but  we're  going  to  getthe--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  We  don't  know what  will  happen  then.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  If  the  money  supply  is  weak,  we  are  goingto  drive  [the  funds  rate]  way  down  and  then  you  get  into  the  '80s[situation].  That's  what we  did  in  1980--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes.11/7/84-48-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  --until  we  finally  stopped  and  the  fundsrate  got  way  below the  discount  rate.  Maybe  that's  what  we  want  to  doat  the  next  step  but  I am  not  sure  we  want  to  do  it  right  now.  Giventhe  way  this  market  has  been  acting,  my  gut  feeling  is  that  we  oughtto  be  in  the  $550  to  $600  million  range.  And  if  the  rate  shows  signsof  backing up  at  that  level--unless  we  get  some  really  good  businessnumbers--we  ought  to  let  borrowing  go  down  further  pretty  promptly  butdo  it  over  [a  few weeks].  We  have  one  two-week  reserve  period  andthen  we  have  another  two-week  reserve  period.  I'd  do  it  by  the  nextreserve  period  maybe,  but  not  all  at  once.  Are we  in  the  first weekof  a  reserve  period?  No,  we're  just  ending  a  reserve  period.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  It  starts  on  Thursday.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  The  reserve  period  starts  tomorrow.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  by  the  beginning  of  the  next  reserveperiod  we  will  have  the  retail  sales  and  the  durable  goods  ordersfigures  and  some  more  data  on  unemployment  claims,  won't we?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  We  will  have  more  flexibility andmore  options  to  move  or  not  to  move  on  the  discount  rate  if  we  go  downto  the  $600  million,  or  possibly  the  $550  million,  level.  I think  the$600  million  level  is  better,  because  otherwise we  are  going  to  havereal  problems  with what  may  be  a  psychological  situation  in  theand  so  affecting  behavior  that  we  may  feel  that  that's  what  we  want  todo  if  conditions  indicate  further  easing.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That  second  reserve  period,  if  I am  reading  itcorrectly  from  the  calendar,  starts  with Thanksgiving.  Is  that  aproblem?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  We  serve  pressed  turkey  here!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You have  a thing  for  pressed  turkey.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  We  don't want  to  end  up  being  the  turkey!

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That  second  period  may be  eccentric  because  ofthe  holiday.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  There  might  be  reserve  problems  because  ofthe  holiday  then,  but  I don't  think  it  presents  any  problem for  edgingthe  borrowing  down.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  particularly--

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  --particularly  at  the  beginning  of  the  period.It  could  at  the  end  of  the  period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  want  to  be  too  arithmetic  aboutit,  but  the  great  majority  of  the  Committee  is  within  $50  million  of$550.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I could  accept  $550  million  as  a first  step.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  What  would  the  second  step  be?11/7/84-49-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  it  would  depend  on  whether we  had  to  gofurther.  We  would  have  to  go  down  toward  $400.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  the  money  supply  is  weak  and  theeconomy  is  weak and  so  forth--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  If  everything  is  still  weak,  probably.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Or  a discount  rate  cut  rather  than  gocompletely  down  to  $400  million  in  the  second  step.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Maybe  both.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  But  that  would  be  a half-point  cut.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I would  just  remind  you  that  the  borrowing  levelwas  just  reduced  from  $750  to  $700  million  this  week.  And  federalfunds  today--although  to  be  sure  it's  Wednesday--are  trading  below  thediscount  rate.  I don't  know what  all  of  that  means  and  the  funds  rateshouldn't  remain there,  obviously, but  we've  already  taken  one  cutfrom  $750  to  $700  million  that  the  market  doesn't  know about.  Nowyou're  suggesting  cutting  it  another  $150  million.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  But  at  the  conference  call,  youremember,  there  were  some  people who  wanted  to  ease  aggressively andsome  of  us--and  I was  in  the  other  group--wanted  to  ease  only  to  apoint where  we  avoided  going down  to  9-1/2  percent  [on  the  fundsrate].  We  thought  that  the  Chairman  and  the  Open  Market  Desk might  goas  low  as  $650  million  on  the  borrowing  assumption.  Some  of  us  hopedthe  rate  would  not  go  much below  10  percent.  I think they  stayed  veryfaithfully  within  the  spirit  of  the  consultation by  bringing  borrowingdown  only  to  $700  million.  And  the  average  fed  funds  rate  recentlyhas  been  a  shade  under  10  percent.  So  I think  it  was  a  perfectlyappropriate move;  I was  a  little  surprised  it  didn't  come  earlierbecause  the  market  situation was  very  strange.  In  a sense,  that'spast  history  almost,  Roger,  and  I think--

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Let  me  be  sure  to  be  understood.  I am  notcritical  of  having  moved  to  $700  million.  I  am just  noting  the  factthat  we  very  recently  moved  to  the  $700  million level  and  to  talkabout  taking  it  to  $550  million  seems  to  me  to  be  a rather  largechange  in  policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You have  a  pretty  good  microscope  if  youcan  tell  the  difference  between  $750  and  $700  million.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Well,  to  be  sure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  was  a feeble  gesture  to--

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I cannot  tell  the  difference,  but  the  fact  ofthe  matter  is  that  there  has  been  an  overt  move  and  we  don't  know whatthe  result  is.

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  I personally  think that  whatever  we  do  theis  another  reason  I would  favor  a more  conservative  approach.  I thinkthe  market  psychology  is  a big  factor  here.11/7/84-50-

MR.  ROBERTS.  There  is  the  possibility,  of  course,  that  the[by  this  Committee],  might  react  adversely  if  we  didn't  move  enough.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  they  did,  then we  ought  to  move  more;  Idon't  think  anybody  is  talking  about  a backup.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  I  still  feel  that  $600  million  givesus  the  maximum  flexibility  to  respond  to  any  changing  circumstanceseither  in  the  market  psychology  or  in  the  real  economy  or--well,  Idon't  think we'll  see  much  change  in  the  money  numbers  in  the  next  fewweeks.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Frankly,  the  difference  between  $550  and$600  million  is  not  going  to  be  visible  in  anything  we  do.  It'swithin  the  range  of  error  that  we  hit  anyway.

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  [It's  not]  the  difference  between  $550  and$600  million.  I think  the  only  thing  that  matters  is  the  extent  towhich  there  is  an  implicit  automatic  assumption  that  you'd  go  downfurther  to  $500  or  even  $400  million.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think  the  assumption  is  that  wewould  automatically  go  down;  the  assumption  is  we  would  go  down  if  themoney  numbers  come  in  weaker  than  anticipated  and  if  the business  andgeneral  news  is  biased  on the  less  strong  side  rather  than  the  strongside.  If  we  come  up  with  a  positive  retail  sales  figure  in  Octoberand  a  strong  new orders  figure  and  the  money  supply  is  up  $3 billionin  the  week of  the  15th  and  another  $2 billion  in  the  following week,the  22nd,  I don't  think  there's  any assumption  that  we'd  do  anything.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Would  it  be  at  $550  million then?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  we  start  at  $550  million,  it  would.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  We  also  ought  to  take  a look  at  this  seasonalquestion.  I don't  know whether  we'll  get  all  that  much  detail  but  Ihave  a  feeling  that  we  may  get  the  decline  mainly  from the  seasonaldropping  off.  I'd  forgotten  about  it  until  it  came  up  today  that  thisseasonal  borrowing must  be  running  toward  the  end  of  its  period  andthat,  therefore,  there will  be  a  drop  in  seasonal  borrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Why won't  they  just  renew  it  for  thefollowing year?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Oh,  I don't  think  they  can;  it's  not  really  donethat  way.  They  have  to  have  a time  when  they're  out  of  debt,  Ibelieve.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It  may  be  a big  factor this  year.  Normallyit's  not  a big  factor  because  the  variations  in  the  other  borrowingand  the  errors  in  their  relationship  swamp  it.  But we're  getting  soclose  to  it  now  that  it  may  very  well  be  a factor  and  we  wouldcertainly  want  to  look  carefully.

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  It  has  been  a factor,  hasn't  it,  Steve?11/7/8451-

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  it's  a factor  technically  in  theintercept,  not  necessarily  in  the  slope  of  the  relationship.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Why  don't  we  compromise  by  saying  theinitial  borrowing  assumption  is  in  a  range  of  $550  to  $600  million  andleave  it  [to  you]  as  you  feel  your  way  over  the  next  couple  of  days?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  How  about  $500  to  $550  million?

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  $600  to  $700  million.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We're  getting  pretty narrow.  From mystandpoint,  if  you  want  to  make  it  $550  to  $600  million,  it's  finewith me.  I'll  make  it  whichever  I feel  like.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That's  the  actual  state  of  the  art,  I guess!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I think  everybody  is  saying we  play  this  alittle  [flexibly];  we've been  playing  it  this  way anyway.  It  dependsupon what  happens  in  the  market.  If  the  market  gets way  ahead  of  it,we  go  slower;  if  it  doesn't, we  go  faster.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I'd  just  like  to  see  you  have  the  flexibility  togo  to  $400  million  if  the  market  conditions  and  the  economy  dictate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  that  is  within  this  anyway.  Youcan  have  an  argument  as  to  whether  the  market  conditions and  theeconomy  dictate  it  but  it's  certainly within  the  range  of  where  we  cango  as  I understand  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I would  like  to  think that  we're  doing  thiswithin  the  context  of  alternative A,  but  we're--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  know what  alternative  Ameans.  That's  just  a  question  of  the  number  to  put  in,  isn't  it?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I just  say  that  to  give  a sense  of--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Frankly,  the  number  that  I thought  ofputting  in  there--but  it's  not  going  to  make  any  difference  to  me--isIf  we  do  it  onthe  round  number  that  is  halfway  between  "A" and  "B." a  quarterly basis,  I'd  put  in  3.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I have  no  problem  with  3.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  There's  a danger  in  the  sense  thatthe  market  is  so  bullish  that  they  are  going  to  seize  on  almostanything.  We're  getting  a very significant  bond  market  rally;  I don'tknow that  we've  seen  evidence  of  it  in  the  stock  market.  Whatever  wedo  they're  going to  do  more,  if  they  think  there's  more  to  come.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  To  some  extent  that  doesn't  bother  mebecause  I don't  think the  general  business  picture  is  very  risky  onthe  up  side.  And  if  it  gets  moderately  risky  on  the  up  side,  we  cantighten  up.  I don't  want  to  get  the  money  supply  [expanding  sorapidly]  in  the  next  few months  that  we've  got  a problem,  but--11/7/84-52-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  gives  you  one  more  chance  to  adjust  theportfolio  if  you're  an FCA  or  something  like  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  [Steve],  did  you write  down  the  languagethat  we  had?  I'll  fill  in  some  numbers  as  you  go  along.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Maybe  Normand  has  been writing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  In  sentence  number  one,  I don't  carewhether  it  says  "reduce"  or  "decrease."  We'll  take  a  vote  on  that."In  the  implementation  of  policy  in  the  short  run,  the  Committeeseeks..." Latin,  aren't  they?"To  reduce"  is  a better  Anglo-Saxon  term;  no  they're both

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  The  staff  sees  no  difference,  but--.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "Reduce"  sounds  better  to  me.  "...seeksto  reduce  somewhat  existing pressures  on  reserve  positions.  Thisaction is  expected to  be  consistent  with  growth  of  M2  and  M3  at  annualrates  of  around  7-1/2  and  9 percent  during  the  period  from  Septemberto  December."  We're  putting  in  there  the  same  figures we  had  before;we're  not  very  far  away.  Now  I don't  remember  what  I  said  before.

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  "M1  is  expected  to  grow  over  the  period  at  arate  of  around  3 percent...."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  3 percent  semi-colon.

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  Or  [comma]  "less  than  anticipated  earlier  inview of  the  decline  in  October."

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  The  unexplained  decline.

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  And  you  thought  about  possibly  putting  in  there"In  light  of  that  decline,  more  rapid  growth  would  be  acceptable."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  In  light  of  that  decline more  rapid  growthof  Ml  would  be  acceptable.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And  then  "More generally..."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  and  then  it  would  go  on  to  say  "Moregenerally  lesser  restraint..."  Instead  of  "acceptable"--we just  usedthe  word  "acceptable"--let's  say  "Lesser  restraint  on  reservepositions  would be  sought  in  the  event  of  significantly  slower  growthin  the  monetary aggregates,  evaluated..."  etc.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Well,  if  you  go  that  far  and  use  theword  "sought"--which  is  all  right  with  me--then  I think we  ought  toleave  in  the  counterbalance sentence.  Otherwise,  if we  leave  that  outtoo,  then  it's  really  going to  look  silly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  it's  all  right  with me.  The  othersentence  says  "acceptable,"  which  is  weaker  than  this  other  one.  Ifthat  sounds  generally  all  right,  we're  still  left  with what  level  ofborrowing we're  starting  off  with.  I am  perfectly  happy with  anunderstanding  of  $550  to  $600  million  that  would be  played  in  thefirst  week  depending  upon how  the  market  conditions  look.  We'll  stay11/7/84-53-there  if  things  are  very  equable.  If  things  come  out  on  the  strongside,  well,  we'd  stay  for  a while;  if  things  come  out  on  the weakside,  we'd  make  another  step  downward.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  And  if  you  have  to  make  a verysubstantial  step  downward,  we  could  have  a consultation  unless  you

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I think  the  second  step  is  to  go  down  to  $400million.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  might  well  want  a consultation  stayingwithin  this,  but  we  will  have  to  see  how  obvious  or  clear  it  is.  Isthat  reasonable?  Let's  see  whether we've  got  the  votes.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  7 to  11?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And  7 to  11  percent  on  the  funds  rate.

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  Not  to  stir  the  soup  but--

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  But  it  will.

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  On  this  M3  number  of  9 percent,  I'd  ask  what  thebasis  for  that  is.  Neither  alternative  A nor  B would  suggest  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  It's  the  one  we  had  the  last  time.

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  The  fact  that  we  had  it  the  last  time  I don'tfind  necessarily  compelling.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You're  quite  right,  neither  "A" nor  "B"has  that,  but  they  are within  1/2  point  of  it  and  I think  that's--

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Just  to  carry  over  the  language  doesn't  seem  tobe  a clean way  of  developing a  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We've  typically  done  that,  or  tried  to,when  it's  very  close.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Looking  back,  the  Committee  has  accepted  prettymuch  staying  there  when the  expectation was within  a percentage  point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Actually, M3  is  running  a little  high  andM2  is  running  a  little  low.  But  gosh,  we  should  be  so  close  on  thesethings  ordinarily!

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  If  we  end  up  with  interest  rates[down]  much  further  with your  second  or  third  step,  there's  going  tobe  absolutely  no  incentive  in  the  Congress  to  do  anything  about  thatdeficit.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  works  the  other  way  if  the  economy  isslowing  down  so  much.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  That's  the  problem.11/7/84-54-

[SECTION]

MR.  BOYKIN.  Governor  Partee's  comment  that  this  would  bedone  in  the  context  of  alternative  A  disturbs  me  a bit.  I canprobably  agree to  what  you're  saying  in  the  context  of  alternative  B.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I don't  know what  "in  the  context  of"means  and  I don't  think  I understand  Governor  Partee's  comment.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I'll  retract  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  in  the  context  of what we're  talkingabout,  which  is  a figure  of  3 percent  for  M1  and  7-1/2  and  9 percentfor  M2  and  M3  and  these  general  borrowing  numbers.  It  is  talkingabout  going to,  say,  $400  million,  without  making  a  great  deal  of  it,if  there  is  a  succession  of  weak  economic  or  monetary numbers.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOYKIN.  I just  could  not  let  his  comment  go  withoutadditional  comment.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  You  just  have  a  short-term attitude  ever  sinceyou  got  through--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  no  one  has  a better  proposal  at  themoment,  I think we  ought  to  vote.
