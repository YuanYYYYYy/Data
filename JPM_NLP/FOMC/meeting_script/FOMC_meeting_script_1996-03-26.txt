CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning,  everybody.  Some  of  us  areslightly blurry-eyed, which is  understandable.  I appreciate  yourcoming  somewhat  earlier.  Would somebody like  to move  the minutes  ofthe January  30-31 meeting?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Move approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Mr.  Fisher.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Thank you.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?  If  not,  wouldsomebody like  to move  to  ratify his  transactions  since  the  lastmeeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I move approval  of  the  domesticoperations.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection, thank you.  Mr.Prell.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With  respect  to your  last  remark, hasthe  decline  in cattle prices  been,  as  best you  can  judge, essentiallya reaction to  the  increased feed  costs  that  have  crushed margins  or  isthere  a broader cattle  supply  cycle  involved here?  Do we  know theanswer  to  that?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I take  it  you  are not referring  to  yesterday's--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  I am  referring  to  the  fact  thatcattle prices  have been  falling  in  the  face  of  rapidly  rising  corn  andsoybean meal  costs,  for  example,  and ranch margins  have  been comingdown quite appreciably.  The question  I am  trying  to  get  at  is  whetherthe weakness  in  cattle prices  is  the  result  of premature  unloading  ofherds,  which  in  the past  has often been  the  determining  factor  in  suchprice  declines.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I don't have  a good answer.  My sense  is  that  areduction in  herd size probably  has  not begun  in any significant way.That  remains  one  of  the uncertainties.  It  could be  that  the marketsanticipate  that  such a development will  occur  in the  not  too distantfuture.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So  a pickup  in meat prices,  should itoccur,  is  still quite  some  time  away?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes.  We  see  that  as  more  of  a risk as  we moveout  into  1997.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think that  is  accurate.  We3/26/96think  the  depletion of  herd inventories has  just  begun,  at most, andmeat prices probably reflect  that  expectation  in  the  context of  risinggrain costs.  The  dominant factor  is  a strong  supply of  red meat  thathas not  been liquidated yet.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do you have  any mad cows  in  yourDistrict?

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  A lot  of  mad ranchers,  but no  mad cows![Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike, you talked a little about  PCs,  and theGreenbook  indicated that  in  recent history we  have  all  underestimatedthe  amount  of  investment  in  that area.  I also  saw The Wall  StreetJournal  article  on Monday.  Is  your reasoning  as  to  why suchinvestment  is  going  to  be  weaker in  the  future similar  to  that  in  thearticle,  or are  there  different  reasons  that lead you to  thatconclusion?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The article  did echo  a couple  of  the  reasons  thatwe  stated in  the Greenbook.  Admittedly, we stated  those reasons  onlyvery briefly.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  One was  the  remark about  replacement  demand.  Icertainly have  heard this  from people  in  the  industry.  They feel  thatin many cases businesses  have acquired about  all  the  computers  theyneed.  The question  is  how fast  they are going  to  replace  thosecomputers,  given  the  changes  in technology.  That  was  a central  themeof  yesterday's  article.  It  also  is  clear that businesses  confront  anongoing decision  about whether  to  buy or  to wait  for  the  next  round oftechnology.  This  is  not  something we  really went  into  in  the  Green-book, but  it  is  one  of  the  uncertainties  in  the  forecast.  We  havegone  through a number of  product  cycles.  At  times  this has been asignificant  feature  in our  thinking--that perhaps people would holdoff buying  until  the  Pentium  chip became  available  or some  earlierversion.  In  this  case,  the  P6  chip  that  is  just  coming out might  leadto  another  issue  of  timing.  Basically,  though, the  industry seems  tobe mature  enough at  this  stage--its  penetration of  the businessinvestment more generally are going to  show through in  computerpurchases.  If  we  are  in a phase when  the  accelerator  effects  are nolonger a big plus, we would expect  that  to  show through more  in  thecomputer sector than  it  might have earlier when computers were  stillincreasing dramatically their penetration  in the  business  sector.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mike, when you first  gave  us  the  projections  for1997  in  the  September Greenbook,  the nominal  GDP growth  in  thatinitial projection was  a very hopeful path  to me because  it  hadnominal GDP  growing  just under 4 percent  for  the  full year.  Thatseemed about right  to  me.  But  in  this Greenbook, your upward revision3/26/96of nominal  GDP by a full  percentage point  for  1997  jumped  out  at  me.You now have  it  rising  just  under 5 percent,  and I know your  realoutput  numbers have  not changed  that  much.  Even  the  CPI  is  only about0.1  percent higher  than you  had  it  before.  As  I look at  this  puzzleand ask where  the  change  is  coming  from, of  course,  it  is  all  in  thedeflator.  What  changed your  thinking  so  that you  now have  nominal  GDPgrowing a percentage point  faster  in 1997  than you  were projecting  sixmonths,  or even  four months,  ago?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  President  Jordan,  that's  a good question.  I donot have  a ready answer  for you.  Obviously, the  deflator has  shiftedmore  than the  other price  indexes.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  By a  full  percentage point.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That  suggests  an  element  of  mix change here.  Itis  conceivable that,  on  further  investigation, we shall  find  thatthere  is  something we  are not  entirely comfortable with  in thesenumbers.  So,  I shall  take  that  question as  something  for us  toinvestigate before  the next  round.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  This  does  not answer  the  question either, butone  of  the  reasons why  the  deflator is  higher now than  it  was  back inof  tending  to  raise  the deflator and  to  lower GDP growth.  That  doesnot  explain why nominal  GDP  is  a percentage point  higher than  it  wasbefore, but  it  does  explain why the  deflator might be  a bit higher.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I should have noted  that.  Because  the nominalGDP  is  higher,  there  is  a bit  of  a mystery here  for us.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I'm glad Jerry pointed that  out.  When youconstruct  the  forecast,  do you  start with  the  nominal GDP  forecast  andwork back?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  No, but  in  the course  of  a forecast  where oneneeds  to  align both the  income  and the product  sides  of  the  accounts,the  nominal  totals are  relevant.  We should  not end up with numbersthat  don't make  sense.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Right.  I am  fairly  startled at  your answer.That  is  why I am asking  the  question as  to  how the  nominal  falls  out.I would  think that you would  start with  a monetary policy forecastthat  would determine a nominal GDP--Don  is  shaking his head, so  I haveit wrong.  Tell  me exactly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  a  simultaneously determinedsystem.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  you have  a  full  percentage point  change  innominal GDP--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It means  that  somebody's  "add factor"changed very substantially.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Well,  all  right,  this  burst  of  nominal  GDP wasthe way of  reconciling things  that  did not add up  in  the model.3/26/96

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Let  me  remind you that  the  observation was  abouta  forecast made  last  September.  That  September  forecast was puttogether prior to  a total  revision of  the national  income  accounts.Some  of  those  revisions  did affect  nominal  GDP going backhistorically.  I don't want to  go  too  far here.  I am not  certain.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But  they did.  There were  significantchanges  in  nominal  GDP.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Right.  But  the  fact  is  that  the  largest  changein these  nominal GDP  forecasts  for  1997  was between  September andsignificant difference  from September  to  now.  But  if  one  looked  atthe  changes  just  over  the past  couple  of  months,  one would see  apretty  small  creep and  it would not be quite  so  shocking.  We have  togo back and  look  at  this  in  light  of  the  fact  that,  as  Dave Stocktonpointed out,  we really did have a  total  change  in  the  accounts  in  thisperiod, both  in terms  of  data whose history was revised and conceptsthat  have  changed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Can  I just  follow up  on  that  as  regards  furtherwork?  Mike,  had you said  in response  to my initial question  that  youhad been assuming a monetary policy indexed by a  6 percent  funds  rate--or,  I guess,  it  was  5-3/4  percent at  that  time--and that  the  1/2percentage point  drop since  then  is  what did  it,  then we  could havetalked about  that,  or a  change  in  fiscal  thrust,  or  something.  Or,coming at  it  from a different  framework,  if  you had  said that monetarygrowth  is  now producing much more  total  spending,  then we  could havetalked about  that  change.  So,  the  underlying question  that has  to beembodied in your answer  once you come back to  this  is  that  at  the  endof  the day we  are still  trying  to  decide whether  a  5-1/4 percent  fundsrate  is  too high,  too  low, or  just  right.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  You  are  getting  into a  fundamental  question  aboutthe whole  forecast,  and  I am  focusing more  on  the  fact  that,  inparticular,  our consumer  price  forecast  looking  out  into  1997  did notchange a  great deal.  Our  real  GDP  forecast has not  changed mucheither,  but we have  switched from  1987  dollars  to  chain-indexed 1992dollars.  Allowing for  that,  our real  GDP  forecast  for  1997  isstronger  than  it  was  back in  September.  You have  just pointed  to  acouple  of  factors  that  would be relevant  to  thinking  about  that:  one,we have a  lower  funds  rate path than we  anticipated at  that  time;two,  we have  removed  some  of  the  fiscal  restraint  that  was  in  theforecast looking  out  through 1997.  So,  there  is  a consistency  in thatrespect.  I was  focusing more on  this  narrower  technical question  andthis  relative movement  in our  price measures.  That  raises  aninteresting question.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions?  If  not,  wouldsomebody  like to  start  the  roundtable?  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  economic  growth  in the TwelfthDistrict has picked up after  a brief  lull  at  the  end of  last  year.Over  the  past  12  months,  growth  in the  District  has been substantiallymore  rapid than  in  the  nation according  to  recently revised employmentfigures.  The  increased pace of  activity  largely reflects  a pickup  in3/26/96California, where job growth also  has  exceeded the  national  figureover  the past year.  It  is  encouraging  that  as  the  economy inCalifornia has  improved, job growth has become more broadly based.During the  early  stages of  the  state's  recovery, job growth wasconcentrated in  several sectors  that were  growing even more  rapidlynationwide,  such as  business  services.  During  1995,  these  sectorscontinued  to  grow rapidly but accounted  for a smaller share  of  statejob growth.  Several  key durable  manufacturing sectors,  primarilyelectronics,  outstripped  the  rest  of  the  country.In the  rest  of  the  District,  employment has been very robustin Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Arizona, which continue  to  be  among  thefive  fastest growing  states.  Washington's  economy slowed over  thepast year, but  the  state's  outlook  for  the  rest  of  1996  appearsstronger  in part  because  of  increased orders  at  Boeing.  Districtemployment has been particularly  strong in  the  services,  trade,  andconstruction sectors.  Manufacturing employment in  the  District hasexpanded by  just  over  1 percent over  the past  12  months.  Thiscompares  favorably, of  course, with declining manufacturing employmentat  the national  level.  However, declining  semiconductor demand mayslow District  manufacturing growth  in the  near term.Turning  to  the  national economy, as  Mike  Prell  stated,  thesubstantial amount  of  economic  news  released since  our  last meetinghas  taken us  on a bit  of  a roller  coaster ride.  Nonetheless,  itprobably has  had little net  effect  on  the  outlook  for  this  year.Assuming a constant  funds  rate  at  the  current  level,  I would expect  tosee  real GDP  growth perhaps  slightly above  its  2 percent potentialrate  in  1996.  Of  course,  the  GM strike will  have  some near-termeffect  on  GDP volatility.  What  I find most  striking about  the  currentsituation  is  the  consistency  of  many inflation  indicators.  They allseem  to be  pointing toward core  CPI  inflation remaining  around 3percent,  roughly the  same  rate  as  in  the  past 3 years.  For example,both  the  unemployment  and the  capacity utilization  rates  are nearcommon estimates  of  their natural  rates.  Also, the  employment  costindex rose  by nearly  3 percent  in  1995;  this  would be  consistent withabout  the  same  increase  in  the  CPI  if  experience  over  the past  15years  is  a guide.  Finally, inflation expectations  as  measured by  EdBoehne's  survey are around 3 percent.  This  isn't  surprising given theinflation indicators  I have mentioned as well  as  experience withinflation in  recent years.  So,  if  we maintain the  current  stance  ofpolicy, it  appears  that  conditions  in  the  economy are  likely tomaintain roughly  the  status quo when  it  comes  to  inflation over  thenext  two years.  Moreover, if  we do  end up  seeing a change ininflation,  it  is  more  likely to  be  on  the up  side  since measures  ofunemployment  and unused  capacity appear to  be slightly  on the  low sideof  their natural rates.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  the  information we  are gettingfrom  our regional  contacts  has been decidedly more upbeat  in  recentweeks.  Both  our latest District manufacturing survey and our  retailservice  sector survey showed broad-based increases  in activity for  thefirst  time  in about  five months.  Some  of  this  news  obviously reflectsthe  rebound that occurred  in  February from  the weather-relatedweakness in January, but not  all  of  it was  a rebound.  We  have madesome  inquiries beyond our normal  survey questions,  and  it  seems  likely3/26/96that  at  least  some  of  the  increase  in the  activity that  we saw inin our  area.  This  apparent  firming also  is  evident  in what  I woulddescribe  as  the noticeably more  optimistic  tone of  the  comments  at  ourboard meeting  a couple weeks  ago and  at  our Small  Business  andAgricultural Advisory Council meeting  last week.  For  example,who  is  on the boards  of  a couple of  largeretail  chains  including one  national retail  chain,  has been generallypessimistic about  the  outlook  for  this  sector ever  sincethe beginning  of  last year. acouple weeks  ago,  though, she  said she was  guardedly optimistic  aboutthe  prospects  for  the retail  sector.  That  really got our  attentionsince  it  was at  variance with what  she  had been  saying until now.who  runs  a multi-state  building materials  chainsupported her  assessment.  In  fact, most one exception  reported greater optimism  in the  retail  sector  at thatmeeting.  Elsewhere,  real estate  activity has been rising noticeablyin most  of  the major urban  areas  of  our District.  The housing marketin Richmond is  said to  be  the  strongest  in  five  years.with  onlyTurning  to  the  national picture, we would agree with  theGreenbook's  increased emphasis  on  the  upside  risk in  the  currentoutlook.  Obviously, we would not want  to put  too much store  in one  ortwo monthly economic  reports.  The  February employment  report,  inparticular, could easily be revised downward somewhat.  But  even if  itis,  I think the  current situation  is  striking  in  that  that  report andmost of  the  other  recent monthly reports  on  industrial production, carsales,  and  other retail  sales  are  stronger  than we had anticipated.That  is,  they are  all  speaking  with one voice.  Although I would  agreethat we  don't yet have  unambiguous  evidence that  aggregate  demand  isnow growing more  rapidly  than potential  output,  I think  it  is  clearthat we  don't have a lot  of  upside headroom.  By all  accounts,  theeconomy has  been operating  for  a while now somewhere  in  theneighborhood of nonaccelerating  inflation  capacity or whatever youwant  to  call  it.With respect  to  inflation,  I am not  unduly  concerned yetabout  the  uptick  in the  core  CPI  that  we have seen  so  far  this  year,since  it may reflect  continuing seasonal  adjustment problems  that wehave had with  that  series  in  the  early months  of  several  recent years.Nor would  I want  to  give  too much weight  to  the  recent  increases  insome measures of  labor compensation, which were mentioned in  theGreenbook.  But as  Bob Parry  just pointed  out,  these  indicators aregenerally moving  in the  same  direction.  That  makes me nervous,especially against  the background of  the  recent  acceleration in moneygrowth and even more  especially against  the background of  the  reallyspectacular  rise  in  both intermediate-  and long-term  interest ratessince  the beginning of  the year  including,  of  course, theextraordinary  25  basis point  jump  in  the  30-year bond rate  on the  daythat  the  February employment  report was  released.  Of course,  until wehave  an  inflation-indexed bond, we  are never going to  know for  sure,when we  get a runup  in rates  like  this,  what part  of  it  is  real  andwhat part  is  an  increase  in  the  inflation  premium.  But with theeconomy currently operating near  full  capacity, that may well be  adistinction without a practical  difference because  even if  all  or mostof  the  increase were  in real  rates,  if  the  economy is  strong enough topush  real  long-term  interest rates  up  this  sharply  in  this briefperiod of  time,  it  may not  be long  before  that  strength presses  on3/26/96capacity with  longer-term  inflation consequences.  Indeed, if  one werea pessimist on  this,  one  could actually read the  recent data assuggesting  that  something  like this  scenario may already be playingitself  out.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  What  is  remarkableabout the  economy  in recent months  is  its  resiliency.  Despitegovernment  shutdowns,  severe weather, and  strikes,  the nationaleconomy is  still  on  track for moderate  growth and low  inflation.  Theeconomy is  also  experiencing what could turn out  to  be  its  greatestrestructuring since  the  Industrial Revolution,  with all  the  attendantinsecurity  that  comes  at  the personal  level  from change  of  thismagnitude.  That,  I think, makes  this  resiliency all  the moreremarkable.  My sense  is  that  the upside and downside  risks  are aboutevenly balanced for  the  period  immediately ahead.  The  inventorycorrection  appears to  be  well  along.  The  consumer, while  somewhatstretched  in terms  of  debt, still  appears  to  have ample  purchasingpower  for sustainable  spending  growth.  And the  strengthening inresidential construction  reflects positive consumer sentiment.  Onemajor builder  told me,  for  example,  that some  of  his  strongest  salesare  in areas  heavily  impacted by the  layoffs  at  AT&T.On  the wage/price  front,  I think we need to  be watchful,  butwe also need  to  keep  in  context where we are.  We are more  than  fiveyears  into  an  economic  expansion.  We have  seen  little  if  anyacceleration in  inflation.  I must  say as  I look back through  thepipeline,  there  really are  few signs  of  an  acceleration of  inflationat  this point.  The positive aspect  of  this  expansion is  that aftermore than  five years we have not had any acceleration of  inflation.My sense  is  that  we  are not  at  the point where that  is  likely;  I thinkinflation will  continue  to  be  subdued  for  the period ahead.Turning  to  the  region, the  Philadelphia District  economycontinues  to  lag  the nation.  Pennsylvania in  particular  is  a majorlaggard.  New Jersey growth  rates  are more promising, and  I think  theoutlook there  is  brighter.  Delaware  continues  to  be  the  little jewelthat it  is  in  the  regional  economy.  What  has  impressed me most  inrecent  weeks  is  the  surge  in  new housing sales  in  the District.  Forthe better builders,  this  surge has been  apparent  for  a couple ofmonths.  Even  in  the dead  of  winter,  the  traffic  into  showrooms  wasvery high, and people were more  than  looking;  they were  signingcontracts.  Now, if you  talk to  the builders who  are  not  the mostcompetitive or  the  leading builders,  they also  are  feeling  the upturnin activity.  It  is  difficult  to  find a builder in  the  District who  isnot  feeling that.  I think low mortgage rates  and  the perception thatmortgage  rates  have bottomed out  have been  a stimulus.  But  at  leastfor  the Philadelphia District,  with existing home  sales much  slowerthan new home  sales  and population growth  slow in  the mid-Atlanticregion,  I think one has  to be  skeptical  about  the  sustainability ofthe  rapid  increase  in  new home  sales.  Nonetheless,  for  a Districtthat has been  rather sluggish  for  a long  time,  a spur  in  residentialconstruction is  welcome at  this  point.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  the  economy in  the Kansas  CityDistrict  continues to  grow at  a fairly strong pace, with recentdevelopments pointing to  greater  strength now  than  I reported at  thelast meeting.  Recent  revisions to  our state  employment statisticsshowed stronger  job gains  in  the Tenth  District  in  1995  thanpreviously  thought,  running  at  a year-over-year rate  of  about  2.7percent.  Moreover,  all  seven  states  in  the  District added  jobs  at  afairly robust pace  in  January.  Principal  sources  of  our  strength arein  the manufacturing  and construction sectors.  District manufacturingcontinues  to  operate  at high levels  of  capacity, and our generalaviation industry  is  doing very well  right  now.  Our survey offactories  throughout  the  region also  indicates considerable  optimismabout  the next  six months.  In  addition,  our directors  are  reportingcontinued  strength  in  commercial  construction and some  expansion  inhousing activity.  As  reported to  us,  loans  are readily available  atour banks  to  both commercial  and other borrowers.Although District  activity is  generally  strong, there  are acouple of  weak  spots.  The region's  energy  industry remains  lacklusterdespite  some higher oil  and natural  gas prices  in  recent months.Another weak area  is  agriculture, where a continued slump  in  cattleprices  and continued  dry weather are hurting  the  income  prospects  formany in  that  sector.  However,  those  farmers  who do  harvest  a cropshould do well  in  light  of  the  high grain prices  right now.Wage  and price pressures  still  remain modest  in  the  District,although labor  markets  appear to  continue  to  get tighter.  More  of  ourdirectors  are  reporting  tight  labor markets  for  entry-level  and  someskilled jobs  as  well.  Prices  of  raw materials  are  showing someincreases.On  the national  front,  I think  that  the  fundamentals  remainstrong, and we  expect,  as  the Greenbook does,  growth at  about  thepotential  rate  of  2 percent.  With  the  capacity in the  economy beingused at  its  current  level,  the  rise  in  core  inflation  from  1994through 1995  probably will  continue, and  I think that  is  a risk wehave to  keep  in mind as  I have  said before.  That  concludes mycomments.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  For  the most part,  the  Eleventh District'seconomy is  showing  reasonably healthy overall  growth, but  as  alwaysthere are  a few pockets of  weakness.  In  the  last  ten days,  we havemet  with our board of  directors,  our Financial  Institutions  AdvisoryCouncil,  and  our Small Business  and Agriculture Advisory Council.  Themessages we  got are pretty much  the  same.  Our urban areas--particularly Dallas,  Houston, and Austin--are  doing  quite well, butthe  rural  areas are hurting.  Cattle ranchers  and  cattle feeders  arehaving a disastrous year  so  far.  Conditions  are expected to  getworse,  and  the  fallout  is  affecting  our  smaller  communities.Once  we get  to  the  rest  of  the  economy, conditions  look  a lotbrighter.  The  stabilization of  the  Mexican economy has given  anadditional  boost  to  our  export demand.  Retail  sales  along  the borderarea have improved a little  lately.  Demand  for  computer chips  andsemiconductors  remains  strong,  and five  out  of  the  six large  chipplants  under  construction in  the  Eleventh District will  produce3/26/96-9-customized chips.  Whether we are  in  the early stages  of  anoverexpansion and excess  capacity remains  an open question, but moreand more people  are beginning  to  express  the view that  when  the nextbig shoe  drops  and affects  the  economy,  it  will be  a boot  filled withcomputer  chips.Our construction  sector  is  quite  strong  and some  markets  arebeginning  to  heat up,  particularly the  industrial  warehouse marketwhere  there  is  talk of  6 million  square  feet  of  speculative warehousespace  coming on  line  in Dallas  alone.  We also  are hearing discussionsindicating that  the  office market  is  back  to where money is  chasingoffice buildings.  While  this  may be  a  little  exaggeration, we  havebeen hearing  for  nearly a year that  the  office market  has  changed  froma tenants'  market  to  a  landlords' market.The picture for  the  energy industry has  been mixed.  Oil  andgas  extraction  continues  its downward  trend in  spite of  the  high-techdrilling  activity that  I referred  to  at  the  last  meeting.  But  the  oilfield machinery  industry is  expanding  thanks  to  drilling demand.  Thepetrochemical  industry has been adding  to  capacity  in  spite  of  recentsoft demand and low prices.  Labor  shortages  continue  to be  mentionedas  a constraint  on  further growth in  a few industries.  Wage  and pricepressures  seem to  be  contained.  Overall,  the  District  shows moderategrowth that  probably  is well  above national  growth  rates.On the national  economy, it  seems  that  we are getting  thesoft  landing we  have been striving  for,  though perhaps  the runway  maybe  a  little  shorter  than we  like.  The risks  seem reasonably wellbalanced, but  that would not have been  the  case  in my opinion  had wenot  reduced  the  fed  funds  rate  at  our  last  meeting.  With respect  tothe  Greenbook, I remain  somewhat more  optimistic  than  the  staff  withregard  to  the outlook  for both  real  growth and  inflation.

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  the New England economy  islooking more  and more  like  the  national  economy, even better  in  acouple  of  respects.  The  small  revision in how we are  looking atthings comes  about  as  a result  of  changes  in  the benchmarks  forpayroll  data, which other people  have commented on.  The changes  haveshown New England's  rate  of  growth  over  the past year  to have  beenabout  the  same  as  that  for  the  nation.  Before  that, we  thought ourregional  economy was  lagging.  The picture may change  a bit when thenational  figures are  revised this  summer,  and New England  still  hasnot recovered  all  the  jobs  it  lost  during  the  recession.  Nonetheless,the  latter episode  is  beginning  to  look more and more  like  a rathersevere,  one-time negative  shock rather  than  the beginning  of  a new,slow-growth  regime.  New England's recent  growth, while  modest,reflects  a continuation of  longer-term  trends  in  each of  the  states.New Hampshire  is  enjoying  the  strongest  growth.  Connecticut  continuesto  lag  behind the  region while Rhode  Island--the basket  case  as  I havereferred  to  it  in  a couple  of  presentations  over  the  last  severalmonths--now appears  to have been holding  its  own  at  least with regardto  job  formation over  the  past year.  Unemployment in  the region  islow, only 5 percent  for  the  region  as  a whole, with New Hampshire nowdown to  3 percent.3/26/96-10-Surprisingly, in view of  the  low unemployment,  hourlyearnings  are  increasing at  an  annual  rate of  only about 2 percentcompared  to  3 percent  for  the  country as  a whole.  Anecdotally,however, our  contacts  indicate  that  there  is  a little more  wagepressure  than these  numbers would  suggest.  Most  of  them  are planningwage  increases  in  the  3  to  5 percent range, where  in  prior months  theyhad been contemplating  2 to  4 percent.  One contact  observed  thatpeople  are  no  longer  comfortable with wage  increases  coveringinflation, and several  others  have commented on  their difficulty  infinding highly  skilled computer workers  and especially  softwareengineers,  for which  there  is  a crying need.  Unfortunately,  laid-offdefense workers  are  not always  seen  as  suitable  for  seeminglycomparable civilian openings.Defense cuts  continue  to be  a drag  on  the New Englandeconomy, with the  region  experiencing larger cuts  in defense-relatedemployment  than  the  country as  a whole.  The pace of  these  cuts  isslowing, however,  and over  the  next several  years  we believe thefallout  in  defense  employment  should be  mild in  the  region.  Despitedefense  cutbacks,  total manufacturing  employment has  fallen  less  inNew England in  the past year  than  in  the nation.  No  areas  of  strengthstand out.  Rather,  employment seems  to  be  increasing  slightly in  avariety of  traditional industries  such  as  lumber, metals,  food,  andpaper  and to  be  stabilizing  in nondefense high-tech  industries.Moreover,  conversations with  a variety of  manufacturers  suggest  that1996  is  likely  to be similar  to  1995.  Business  is  not  great,  but  anumber of  contacts  describe new orders  as  pretty good or  decent.Indeed, some companies  that pared employment  in  1995  are  now planningmodest  increases  in  staff, and  several  contacts  report  efforts  toincrease prices  of  final  goods.Retailers  continue to  worry about  competitive pressures  andconsumer  anxieties.  However,  several  contacts with  stores  in otherregions  observed  that  their 1996  results have  been better  in  NewEngland.  Moreover, some  of  those  who  complained most bitterly in  thepast now report  that  their  1995  profits were up  rather  substantiallyrather  than down as  they had suspected.Turning  to  the  national  scene,  we  agree with the  Greenbook'sassessment  that  the  likely outcome  for  the next year  or  so  is  GDPgrowth  at a  rate near potential,  with unemployment  relativelyunchanged,  and some  rather  modest upward pressure  on wages  and prices.While  I agree  that  the  risks  to  this  forecast  seem balanced right now,there may be  some  reasons  to  believe  that  it  is  marginally  subject  tosurprise  on  the  down side.  That  is  especially because  it  includesvery optimistic  projections  for both  residential  investment  andconsumer durables,  at  least when compared with several  otherforecasts,  and because of  the  upward trend in  interest  rates,particularly  since the  employment  report  released  in early March.  Iwould view the possibility that  the  interest-sensitive  sectors may beweaker  as  a potentially moderating  influence on  the upward  tick,albeit  small,  in  inflation  that  is  incorporated  in  the  forecast.  Ifin  fact  we do  see  a March employment  report  that  is  anywhere  close  tobeing as  strong  as  the numbers  we  saw for  February, I  think we wouldhave  to  take  rather  decisive steps  at  that  point  to  keep  the  expecteduptick  in  inflation  from becoming  a  surge.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.3/26/96-11-

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  economic  activity  in the  Midwestremains  at  high levels,  with  some  sectors  relatively strong  and othersshowing  signs  of  moderate weakening.  In general,  housing and retailsales  continue  to  perform well;  manufacturing  is  growing  slowly;  andlabor markets  remain  tight.  A  major  concern  has been  the Dayton  brakeplant  strike  against General Motors.  The  strike has had adisproportionately large  impact  on  the  Seventh District  where half  ofGM's  laid-off assembly workers  in  the United  States  are  located.Moreover, reports  have  been  increasing of  related  layoffs  at  Districtsuppliers  of  auto parts  such  as  engines,  transmissions, brake  systems,exhaust  systems,  and electrical  systems.  Steel workers  in  Wisconsinand  Indiana  also have  been affected.  First-quarter  production has,  ofcourse, been depressed by the  strike  and the  layoffs.  While  some  ofthe  lost  production will  be made up  now  that  the  strike has beensettled, GM will use  the  strike  to  reduce  inventories  of  1996 modelcars  and may wait  for  their new 1997  models  to  rebuild their  carstocks.  For  light  trucks,  GM plants  were already running at  close  tocapacity, so  it  is  not  clear that  light  truck production in  the  secondquarter will  be much higher  than  it  otherwise would have  been.  Thestrike  does not  appear  to  have affected sales  of  light vehiclesbecause  inventories  of most GM car models were  above what the  industryconsiders desirable,  and we understand  that  light  truck dealers  in  theDistrict have  already  sold  out  their  first-quarter allotment.Preliminary reports  indicate  that  sales  of  light vehicles  so  far  thismonth are  running at  about  a  15  million unit  annual pace or  a bitbetter, which  implies  a 14.9  or  15  million unit  rate  for the  firstquarter,  slightly above  the  latest  12-month moving  average.District  retailers  indicate  that  sales  have  improved from  theweak results  reported for  January.  Sales  in  February were somewhatstronger  than in January but  the bounceback was  not as  noticeable asit  appears  to  have been elsewhere  in  the nation.  I would note  thatthe  Midwest was  hit by bad weather  in  February rather  than January andthat  was  a  factor.  Retailers  report  that  sales  so  far  in March showabout  the  same  increases  from  last  year  as  they had in  February.Contacts  said  it  was  too  early  to  discern any noticeable  impact  onsales  in  communities with a  large  GM presence and  actually none wasexpected.  Reports  indicate  that  Midwest  consumers are  less  in debtand delinquency rates  are  generally  lower  than  those  in other parts  ofthe  country.  Therefore,  consumers  are better  able  to  take  onadditional  debt.On  balance,  it  appears  that  the  level  of housing  activity isstill  fairly  strong  in most parts  of  the District.  Housing  starts  inthe Midwest  fell  in  February, but  that  appears  primarily to  reflectcolder-than-usual weather.  Permits  have held up  and homebuildersremain optimistic.  The  District does not  seem  to  have  anoverabundance  of  either new or  existing homes  for  sale.In  labor markets,  the  issue  of  job  security  continues  to  be  afactor mentioned whenever we  try to  reconcile reports  of  tight  laborrate  in our  states  is  still  averaging  about  1 full  percentage pointbelow the  national  average.  Both  total  and manufacturing payrollemployment  increased  in January,  in  contrast  to  what was postednationally for  that month.  Reports  indicate  that  the  use  of  temporary3/26/96-12-workers  by manufacturing  firms  has picked up  since  the  end  of  1995  aswell.After taking weather differences  into  account,  it  appearsthat  manufacturing  activity in  the  District  continues  to  do betterthan  in  the  nation  as  a whole,  although  less  so  than  in  the past  as  weobserve Midwest manufacturing  activity  converging to  the  nationalexperience.  For many of  our major durable  goods producers,  activityhas  been  flattening or  edging  down from  the  record or  near-recordlevels  of  last  year.  Purchasing managers'  surveys  from Detroit  andMilwaukee  indicated expanding  activity  in both January  and February.However,  the  Chicago  survey moved  from  indicating expansion  in Januaryto  contraction  in  February.  Confidential  information we have  receivedindicates  that  the  Chicago  Purchasing Managers'  report  to  be  releasedthis  Friday, March 29,  will  show  the  index increasing  from 44.9  incontinued to  contract  in March but  at  a  somewhat reduced pace.  Theweakness  evident  in  the  Chicago report  for March does  not  appearrelated to  the GM  strike because relatively  few workers were  laid  offin  Illinois  and the  survey  was  taken before  the  strike  had gained muchmomentum.Farmers  in  the  Midwest are gearing  for a  sizable  increase  inspring plantings,  especially corn.  Analysts  expect  combined corn  andsoybean acreage  to be  the  largest  in over  a decade, up  7 to  8 percentfrom  last  year.  Crop  input  prices  are up, especially  for  fertilizers,but  supplies  are  reported to  be  adequate to  accommodate  the  increasedacreage.  More  generally, however, most  reports  on prices  still  seemto  point  to  little upward pressure  or declines  for  a broad range  ofitems  such as  aluminum, copper, paper, steel  scrap,  and  steel  millproducts.  The price component  of  the  Chicago  Purchasing Managers'survey  for March  continued on  a downward  trend and  actually  indicatedstraight month.Turning to  the  national picture,  we  do  not have  any seriousdisagreements  with the  Greenbook,  although we  still  are  slightly moreoptimistic on  inflation.  One  reason  for  our marginally  greateroptimism is  that  real  GDP  is  estimated  to  have grown only 1.4  percentlast  year.  Obviously, there  is  a  lot  of uncertainty surrounding  thatestimate,  but  our  analysis  indicates  that  the  output  gap was  about nilprior  to  1995  and if  our  estimate  of  potential  output  is  accurate,some  slack has  built up  in the  aggregate  economy, which  should reducethe  likelihood  that  inflation will  accelerate  this  year.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Looking  through theanomalies  of  the  last  several months,  it  appears  to us  that  the  SixthDistrict  continues  to  grow at  a moderate pace.  The bad weather  islikely  simply to  have  increased  the  amplitude  of  the  seasonal patternin activity rather  than  to  have exerted  some  lasting effect  on overallperformance.  When we  look beyond these distractions, we  think  thatthe  Southeast will  continue  to  outperform  the  rest  of  the nation,  butprobably by a  smaller margin  than has  been the  case  in past years.  Asbefore,  this  improved performance  is  based on  continued migration ofboth  businesses  and people  into our  region.3/26/96-13-Retail  sales  grew very unevenly  in  the  District  during  thefirst  three months  of  the year, with  a notably slow start  early in  theyear, especially  in  the  northern part  of  the  region where weather wasclearly a factor.  More recently, sales  of many goods,  particularlyapparel  and autos,  appear to  be  much improved.Home  sales  in our  area have been particularly brisk  in  early1996  after a slow  fourth quarter.  Much of  the  acceleration  isreported  to  be  in  starter homes  at  the  low end  of  the market.  Bothresidential  and nonresidential  activity remained surprisinglyresilient  throughout  the bad weather period.  Commercial  real  estatethe  industrial market  is  the most  active, with  lots  of  construction ofwarehouse and distribution  facilities.  The  retail  constructioncomponent  finally seems  to be  slowing  in  some areas  that have  reachedsaturation, and  that  is  something we have been anticipating  for  sometime.  In Atlanta as  you might expect,  Olympic activity has  keptconstruction at  a very high plateau, starting last  year.  The  entiretown  is  a mess.  Bulldozers and paving equipment have  the  right-of-wayover cars  and people.  We promise  to  be  ready when  the time  for  theOlympics  comes, but  if  you can avoid it,  please don't  visit  us untillater  in  the  summer.According to  our regional  survey of  manufacturers,manufacturing activity actually eased off  a bit  in February, but  atthe  same  time expectations  for  the next  six months  are  reportedlyimproved.  In our  District,  the  strongest sector  is  durables,  whilenondurables,  especially paper,  are lagging,  and  the apparel  industrycontinues  to  shrink.  In  fact,  the  apparel  industry  is  in  secularWe  don't  expect  those  jobs  to  come back  any time  soon.Payroll  employment  expanded moderately  in  January  followingthree months of  only modest  growth.  But  for  the  last  12  months  endingin January, payroll  growth  in  our region was  3.4  percent,  more  thandouble  that  of  the nation.  There continue  to be  scattered reports  ofwage pressures  and labor  shortages,  and those  are  in  isolated pocketsin  our District.  At  the  same  time,  both our manufacturing survey andbusiness  contacts  report minimal  price  increases  in both raw materialsand  finished goods.As  far  as  the  national  outlook is  concerned, the unusualcircumstances  of  late  1995  and  early 1996  certainly have muddied  thewaters considerably and left  us with more  uncertainty than wouldusually be  the  case.  On balance, however, I believe  the  economy hasbeen relatively resilient  after  taking account  of  those  specialfactors  early in  the year.  So,  our  forecast  of  continued moderategrowth and moderating inflation  is  essentially unchanged.  From whereI stand,  I see pretty solid underpinnings  for moderate  growth  inhousehold spending  and  investment,  a return to  inventory balance, andgood export  demand.Except  in the  details,  our  outlook is  very  similar  to  that  ofthe  Greenbook.  After  a modest  first  quarter  followed by a bounceback,I would expect a resumption of  moderate growth in  the  2 percent  range.I still  think  that  2 percent  is  probably a little  less  than potential,so  it  may not  come  as  a surprise  that  I am more optimistic  than  somewith  regard to  inflation.  In  fact,  I think there  is  a reasonable3/26/96-14-prospect  that  inflation  could moderate  over  the next  two years.  It  isunlikely  that  the  moderation will  be particularly dramatic  or  smooth,but  I  think there  is  a reasonable  chance  that  the CPI  could movecloser  to  the  2-1/2  percent  level  rather  than  the  3 percent  level  thatsome  seem  to  expect.  I continue  to  believe  that  our policies  andother  factors have  combined  to  create  a more  favorable price-settingenvironment  that  is  both  genuine and persistent.  Thank you, Mr.Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Our District  economyhas  outperformed the  national  economy  for a number  of  years,  but  I donot have  the  impression  that  that  is  continuing.  If  anything,District growth  certainly  has been  less  than  that  of  the nationaleconomy  in  recent  months.  The principal  areas  of  concern are  themanufacturing  and cattle  industries.  All  the  cattle producers  withwhom I have  talked  describe  their  industry as  an  unmitigated disaster.Having  said  that,  I think the  District economy in  general  is  stillfundamentally  sound.  Part  of  the  reason  for  the  slowing growth  is  afactor  that  I have mentioned before,  namely, labor  supply  constraints.Labor markets  remain very tight.  There  are a  few more,  but stillscattered, indications  of  increasing wage pressures  and  a somewhatmore  aggressive attitude on  the part  of  labor.  In  addition,  I wouldsay  that  consumer spending  on both  goods and houses  has been healthyin  the  last  couple  of  months.With  regard to  the national  economy, as  has  been the  case  forsome  time,  I remain  generally  comfortable with  the  contours  of  theGreenbook  forecast.  I do  think that  the  risks  to  the  outlook may haveshifted a bit  recently, and  I say this  because  as  I look  at  the  realside of  the  economy today,  it  strikes  me as  being  in better shape  thanI had earlier  expected it  to be  at  this point.  Therefore,  I thinkthere  is  probably less  risk  of  prolonged weakness  or even  prolongedstagnation on  the  real  side.  By  the  same  token,  as  I look  at  some  ofthe potential  indicators  of  rising  inflation  and in  particular thinkabout  conditions  in  labor markets  and  labor attitudes,  I sense  thatthe  risk of  somewhat more  inflation than  at  least  I had  earlieranticipated may also have  increased.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  The Eighth District  economycontinues  to  expand.  A  few contacts  noted some  softening at  thebeginning of  the year,  but many expect  a pickup as  we move  into  thesecond quarter.  Unemployment  rates  in District  states  tended  to  jumpearly in  the  year  for weather-related reasons,  but Missouri was  anotable exception;  the  state enjoyed a very low unemployment rate  of3.4  percent  in January.  About  3,400  District workers  were  laid offbecause of  recent  strike  activity against  General Motors,  andunofficially about  800  workers  in  related  industries were  affected.But  looking forward,  District  auto production  at  Ford and Chryslerplants  is  expected  to  rise  4.7  percent  in  the  second  quarter.  Loandemand,  especially  for  commercial  loans,  is  still  strong  in most partsof  the District.  Unseasonably cold weather produced significantdamage  to  winter wheat  in southern  Illinois  and catfish  in  theMississippi  portion of  the District  in  February.  [Laughter]  It's  abig  industry!3/26/96-15-Nationally, the  economy  is  displaying some  underlyingstrength.  The February employment report  was more  than  a simplerebound  from  a weak January.  The pace of  net job  creation wasaveraging  somewhat better than  100,000  per  month over  the  last  ninemonths  of  1995.  It  seems plausible  that  the January data weredepressed by about  300,000.  Even  if we  count  300,000  of  the  Februarytotal  as  a rebound and add 100,000  for  trend growth,  the  705,000about 300,000  jobs.  Maybe  some  of  that  increase will be  revised away.Retail  sales,  factory  orders,  and housing  starts  also  indicateunderlying  strength.For  those who  look at  the  latest  developments  in  the  realeconomy as  a  trigger  for monetary policy actions,  I  think  it  is  clearthat  we  moved  last  time without  much new data;  and when  the data  camein,  they were  contrary to  what  was  expected.  Some here  referred toour  lowering the  federal  funds  target as  buying  insurance,  but thiswas  not a hedge  in any usual  sense.  In  fact,  we were making  aspeculative bet on  the nature  of  the  incoming data.  It  is  a bet  thatwe  likely lost  now that  the  economy  looks  a  lot more resilient  andalso a  lot  more inflation prone.The press release  accompanying the  last move  compounded theproblem in  my view by suggesting  that  the  FOMC  is  complacent  aboutlonger-term inflation objectives.  It  read a bit  like  a victorystatement  saying in part,  "with price  and cost  trends already subdued"when in  fact we are  still  a long way  from price  stability  and Q4/Q4CPI  is  projected to  rise  in  1996.  Furthermore,  as  others havementioned, some  recent  data are  worrisome,  including the  employmentcost  index  for  total  compensation  of  private  industry workers  as  wellas  benefits  costs,  which were discussed at  some  length  in  theGreenbook.  The  long-bond yield,  as  others  have mentioned,  also hasincreased more  than  50  basis points  since  the  last meeting.  Animportant component  of  that  yield, namely, longer-term inflationexpectations,  is  a matter  of concern  for  this  Committee.  As  I havestressed before,  despite FOMC pronouncements  of  a commitment  to  stableprices, market  participants  and professional  economic  forecasters donot expect  lower  inflation  in the  foreseeable  future.  Theseexpectations  are  a large part  of what  is  standing  in  the way  offurther progress  toward price  stability.  The way to  influence  thoseexpectations  is  for this  Committee  to  announce  a  target path forinflation over  the next  several years  that  contemplates  a reductionfrom the  current  3 percent  level.  In  addition,  of course,  we musttake  actions consistent  with  that path.  An  opportunistic  approachwill  buy us no  credibility whatsoever nor market  behavior  thatreinforces  our  efforts  to  achieve  our  objectives.  Thank you.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Theeconomy of  the  Second District  continues  to  underperform the  nation asit  lumbers  along on  its  slow growth path.  Recently, retail contactsreported that  February sales  rebounded  to  plan  levels  following  thevery disappointing January and  the  record blizzard.  Senior  loanofficers  at  small-  and medium-sized banks reported  that  demand  fornearly all  types  of  loans  has  strengthened over  the  last  two months,with  the  largest  increase developing  in  the  consumer  loan  segment.  Ofcourse, we  all  know that  the  consumer  loan debt  level  is  a bit higher3/26/96-16-than we  might wish.  In  the  securities  industry, a major investmentbank  reported a three-fold  increase  in pretax profits  for  the  fiscalquarter ending  in  February compared  to  the  same period a year  ago,  andour market  soundings  indicate  that  its  competitors  also  seem to  behaving  a robust quarter.  The profits  in  that  industry are  animportant contributor  to  income  growth in  New York State.  Overall,the  District's housing  industry has  remained weak  in February andearly March, but we have  a glimmer  of  hope  in  the  commercial  realestate  market, with  continued improvement  in  the  vacancy rates  inmidtown Manhattan.  We continue  to  be  concerned  about  the  District  andwhy it  underperforms  the nation.  We  are  going to  be moving even moreof  our research  capabilities  into  that  area and  look  forward  to  havinga couple  of  meetings  toward  the  end of  the year:  one  consisting ofeconomists  will  try  to  identify  the problems  and  the  other ofpolicymakers  will  discuss what might  be  done  to  get  the  area  growing  abit  faster.At  the national  level,  our  forecast  is  very similar to  thatof  the Greenbook.  The  Greenbook, as  you  know, has  growth at  justabout 2 percent  in  1997,  and we  have  it  somewhat below that.  Notsurprisingly, therefore,  our CPI  forecast  is  more attractive,  at  2.8percent  this  year and  2.7  percent  in  1997.  We  have  the unemploymentrate moving up  some,  in  fact  to  about  6.2  percent  next year.  That  isto some  degree  related to  our view that  the participation rate,especially by adult  males,  has been unusually low,  and there  might  besome rebound  in  labor participation that  would raise  the  unemploymentrate.  So,  with  the  favorable data  recently on employment,  consumersentiment,  auto  sales,  retail  sales,  housing starts,  and net  exports,the major shift  that  we have made  in  our  forecast  is  that  we  thinkthat  the  risks  to  the  forecast are  now  quite well balanced.  At  theprevious meeting, we were concerned  about  the  risks  on the  down  sideand therefore  thought  that  the  "insurance" easing,  as  the  Chairmandescribed  it  at  the  last  meeting, was  appropriate.  Now we  think thatthe  forecast  looks  rather  good  and  that  the  risks are  quite wellbalanced.

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It  seems  to  me  thateconomic  activity  is  tracking  along the  Greenbook path about  as  we hadexpected and hoped.  I want  to  associate myself particularly with  EdBoehne's  comment  that  the remarkable  resilience of  this  economy hasbeen  the most  interesting development  recently.  This  certainly is  notsurprising, but  it  is  highly gratifying.  Perhaps  the  only surprise  isthe  very early  and rather  strong reemergence  of  strength  in  theeconomy, and  along with that  a more credible upside  risk and  itsmirror  image,  a  little  alleviation of  the downside  risk going  forward.This  seems  to  leave us  with a high  likelihood of  a quite  satisfactoryeconomic performance  in  the period  ahead.  I agree  with Vice ChairmanMcDonough that  the  risks  appear  to be  symmetric, perhaps  not  terriblystrong at  this point,  but  it  seems  to  me  that  they are moving  in theupside direction.  My main concern  at  the moment  is  that  all  of  thislooks  just  a little  too neat  and  too pat.  I can't  quite  trust  it.  Weknow  that  challenges  are going  to  emerge,  and  I suspect  they probablywill arise  somewhat  sooner rather  than  later.  We will  just  have  to  bealert  to  what  those challenges  turn out  to  be  and when they  are goingto appear.3/26/96-17-

MS.  YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The progress  of  theeconomy over  the  last  several  months  has  been reminiscent  of  "theperils  of  Pauline,"  with blizzards,  government  shutdowns,  threats  ofdefault  on  the national  debt,  strikes,  and a  frightening albeit  briefdive  in the  stock  market  threatening  the progress  of  our heroine.Nevertheless,  the  single most probable outcome  at  this  stage  is  thatthis  economy will  survive  its  treacherous  adventure and ultimatelyattain  trend growth with  stable  inflation.  I agree with the  Greenbookassessment  that  the  stage  appears  to  be  set  for  a rather  sharp  reboundin  economic  growth  from  the  average pace  in  the  fourth and  firstquarters.  Considerable progress  appears  to  have  been made  in  reducinginventory  overhangs,  so  there  is  a  reasonable prospect  thatinventories will  become  a neutral  factor  in  the  economy in  the  not  toodistant  future.  Meanwhile,  demand has held up  surprisingly well  inthe  face  of  a rather  large  inventory adjustment  in  the  fourth quarter.Over  the  longer  term, a projection  of  near-trend  growththrough  1997  with roughly stable  inflation strikes  me  as  a plausiblescenario,  although there  are  some risks.  On  the negative  side,  I amparticularly  concerned at  this  stage  about  the  possibility of  asignificant  stock market  correction.  The  current  level of  stockprices  is  not  impossible, but  it  is  increasingly difficult  to  justifyin  terms  of  fundamentals.  Disappointing earnings  reports  could easilyset  off  a correction.  I am also  concerned about  the  likely negative,albeit  lagged, impact  on  housing and consumer durable  spending of  thevery substantial  increases  in  interest  rates  since  our  last  meeting.I find  the  longer-term Greenbook projection  of  housing startsparticularly optimistic  in  light  of  these  increases.  On  balance, withintermediate-  and long-term  interest  rates  at  their  current  levels,  Ifeel  less  certain than  the  staff  that  trend growth  is  possible as  wego out  in  the  forecast  period.  But  there are  also  some risks  on  theinflation  front.  While  recent  readings  on average hourly  earningsprovide reassurance  that  wages  are not  accelerating,  the  jump  inhealth  insurance costs  evident  in the  fourth-quarter employment  costindex creates  the worrisome  prospect  that  these benefit  cost  increasesone  single  report,  but  I do  agree with  the  Greenbook's  assessment  thatthis  is  one  of  the risks  going  forward.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  fog has  liftedsomewhat  since our  January FOMC meeting,  and perhaps we  are nowoperating only  in patches  of  fog.  I continue  to  believe  that  it  willbe well  into  the  second quarter  before we  have a  clear picture  of  whathappened even  in  the  fourth  quarter,  let  alone  the  first  quarter  ofthis  year.  We  will  continue  to  hear arguments  about  whether  thegovernment  shutdown obscured  the  sampling periods  and  so on.  Therewill be  arguments about  the  effects  of  the  weather--whether or  notfirms  will make up  their  losses  and whether  or not needed  inventoryadjustments have  occurred.  I also  think that  the  new data  calculationmethods will  continue to  challenge  us  to become  comfortable with thenotion that  2 percent  real  GDP  growth  is  in  fact  what we should  bestriving  for.3/26/96Obviously,  the past  is  behind us,  but  a clear picture  of  thenear past or  even what  is  in  the proverbial  "rear view mirror" canhelp  us  understand whether or not  the  economy  is  going up,  down, orhas  just rounded a corner.  This  uncertainty about  the  near pastcertainly  has been reflected  in  the markets.  There  is  sensitivity  toalmost  every piece  of  economic  news  that  is  released, and we  seem  tobe  having  a considerable reaction, perhaps  even  overreaction,  tounanticipated  economic  news.I was  struck  by the  sizable  swings  in  the  GDP  estimates  inthe  Greenbook since  the  last meeting.  There  is  quite  a change  in  thefourth-quarter,  the  first-quarter, and  the  second-quarter  estimatesfor  GDP.  Most of  it  is  explained by the  inventory correction, whichhas  shifted  some  of  the  growth  from  the  fourth quarter  to  the  firstquarter.  That  improves  the  outlook  so  that  the second-quarterestimate  is  considerably higher.  The net  effect  is  a  forecast  that  isa bit brighter.  Going  forward,  I quite agree  that  the  best  estimateis  for  continued moderate  growth.  The  employment  report  that  we gotfor February probably was  on  the  high side  and may well  be  revised.Even  so,  it  is  a relatively strong  report.  Industrial production hasbeen stronger.  Housing may slow a bit  due to  the backup  in  interestrates, but  the  recent data  have been  surprisingly strong,  and  thefundamentals  for  continued activity  in housing  remain pretty good.  Inaddition, my brother just  sold his  house.  [Laughter]  This  is  a signof  considerable  strength  in  the  housing sector--in  the  Fifth District,I might  add.  [Laughter]With respect  to  business  fixed investment,  I think  it  ispretty unlikely  that we will  see  growth continue  at  the  same pace  asin  1994  and  1995.  By  the  same  token,  I don't  think there  is  any majorreason  for  a big pullback.  The  cost  of  capital  is  still  fairly  low,and  if  we are  correct  in  forecasting  that  aggregate  spending will holdup  and that  businesses have a  continuing commitment  to  holding costsdown, profits  and  cash  flows  should be  reasonably  strong.Nevertheless,  business  firms  already have  added a good deal  ofcapacity,  so  we  probably will  see  less  growth  in  spending  onindustrial production facilities.  As  has  already been mentioned, theoutlook  for  spending  on  computers  is  not as  strong  as  it  has been, andsuch spending has  explained a  lot  of  the  growth  in business  fixedinvestment.  So,  I think we probably will  not experience  quite  as muchstrength  in business  fixed investment  as  we have  seen  recently.Again  going  forward,  I don't  think that  the  usual  bottlenecksthat  one might  see  in  a mature  expansion  are present.  We  seem to  haveplenty of  credit  availability.  The banks  and  the markets  are  stillreasonably well  positioned to  support expansion.  We are  not  seeing  asmuch  in  the way of balance  sheet adjustments.  There  are  some  but notenough  for  us  to find  ourselves  in a windshear  situation.  I thinkhousehold spending  is  likely to  keep pace with income.  This  is  alittle  less  optimistic  than  the  Greenbook, but  I think  that  some  ofthe  hypotheses  relating  to household spending  suggested in  theGreenbook are very interesting.  These  include  job anxiety  andperceptions  of  the  shakiness  of Medicare/Medicaid.  Perhaps  people arebeing attracted  to  high stock prices.  I hope  this  is  going  to meansome  improvement  in  saving, and maybe people  are  hitting  theirborrowing  limits.  So,  while moderate growth  is  a probable  forecast  onbalance,  I think there  are risks  to  the  outlook.3/26/96-19-One  of  the big risks  that  several people  around the  tablehave mentioned is  on  the  inflation  side.  While  I believe  it  ispossible to make  some progress on  the  inflation  front  given reducedcapacity pressures,  labor market  uncertainty, and cautious  consumers,I do  think that  some  of  the  inflation risks  have  increased  since thelast  FOMC meeting.  The increase  in  oil prices  is  an  example.  Anotheryear of  bad crops  could cause  prices  to  ratchet  up.  Wage  increasescould  finally be  heading up.  Also, prospects  for major gains  in  termsof deficit  reduction have  diminished considerably even  since  the  lastFOMC meeting.In sum,  I think  the  economy  is  in  a more balanced  situationthan  it  was  in  late  January and we  can look  forward to  moderateeconomic growth  with a bit  less  uncertainty than  we were  feeling  in

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

MR. JORDAN.  The Fourth  District  is  in between  Ed Boehne'sand Mike Moskow's Districts,  but  so  much for geography.  It  is  hard toget  a reading not  only on what  is  actually happening but  on what  isexpected in our area  for  this  year and  the year ahead--the  timehorizon  that  is  relevant  for policy discussions--especially when  thenational  statistics are  so  troublesome.  An optimistic note  for  thelonger  term  from one  of  our  directors--he  called  it  an  optimistic noteanyway--was  his report  that  applications  for admission  to  law schoolthis  fall  are  down 20  percent.  In  trying  to  filter all  the  anecdotalinformation,  the Beigebook  report  for our  District was definitely moreupbeat  than  the previous  couple  of  Beigebooks.  One  director who  haslived in  the  area  all  his  life  noted that  this  change  in mood happensevery  spring.  Sometimes  it  is  a reflection  of  how bad the winter was.Since this  was  the  second worst winter  of  the century,  a rebound maynot be  too  surprising.  That  also may explain  some of  the  resiliencyof  the national  economy  that both Governor Kelley and  Ed Boehne noted,and I will  come back  to  that  in  a moment.You  may have  seen  the  other  front page article  in yesterday'sWall  Street  Journal  that  covered the  export  industries,  includingthose  in Ohio,  and  indicated how that  sector  of  the  economy has  servedas  an underpinning to  overall  economic  activity  to  an  extent  that  maynot  have received  the  attention  it  deserves.  Another  issue  that  wehave  been  looking  into  is  retail  sales.  Our  region  of  the  country  isincredibly strong  in  retailing  companies,  companies  that  operate notonly nationally but  even globally.  There  are consistent reports  ofmuch  stronger  catalog sales;  their mail  order  sales are  continuing  torise very sharply as  a percent  of  their totals,  often at  double-digitrates.  This  raises questions  about how much  of  that  is  domestic andhow much  of  it  is  what we would call  exports,  whether it  gets  reportedthat  way or not.  A new phenomenon  that people  are  citing,  though  itis  hard to  quantify,  is  Internet  sales,  ordering from  these companiesthrough the  Internet  for  shipments abroad and bypassing the  usualretail  distribution problems  that  exist  in Japan  in particular butalso  in  other places  around the  world.  The Commerce Department  saysthat at  this  point  they  don't have a good handle  on  either  themagnitude  of  this  or what  it  is  contributing  to  total  sales.  They arepretty certain  that  they are underestimating  total  sales,  but  theycan't  quantify it.3/26/96-20-Because of  the  difficulty of  interpreting  the  numbers,  I madea special  effort yesterday  to  get  the  first-quarter report  of  theNational  Federation of  Independent Businesses  that  will  be released  ina  few days.  Not unlike  the  comments  around  the  table  this  morning,the  report will  be  fairly mixed.  Employment plans  are  down somewhatfrom  the  earlier report  while capital  spending plans  are up, which  iscontrary  to  the commentary  in  the  Wall  Street Journal  column  and  thegeneral  concerns  about  capital  spending.  Small  businesses  indicatethat  they will  increase  such  spending this  year  to  what would be  arecord  level  in  the  index.The  inflation news  is  fairly  good.  Fewer  firms  are nowplanning  to  increase  their prices  this  year  than in  previous  reports.This  still  raises  in my mind some  very fundamental questions  about  theprocess  by which  an  inflationary phenomenon  is  created.  I don't  thinkof  inflation as  being  rising prices.  In one  sense,  I am veryencouraged as  regards  the national  economy.  It  is  one  of  thosestories  about  the water glass  being half  full  or half  empty.  Comparedto  a year ago,  inflation psychology seems  to  have  improved by about1/2  percentage  point.  A year ago  at  this  time,  the  general  forecastwas  that  inflation would rise  to  about  3-1/2  percent.  The currentexpansion has now lasted  several  years  and every year  the  forecast  hasbeen  that  inflation would go up.  Finally, we  are at a point  where  theforecast  is  that  inflation is  going  to  remain  the  same  this  year.  Itdown next year.  So,  we have  to go  through a transition period of  atleast no  longer  forecasting rising  inflation to  get  comfortable  withthe  idea that,  even as  we  head into  the  sixth year of  the  expansion,inflation is  going  to  remain  the  same.  The next  step  is  for people  toadjust psychologically  to  that,  and  in  the  future  inflation actuallywill  go down.I am  trying to  interpret  what has  been going  on  in  assetto  be  very careful  in  what we  think we know about  that.  What has  beenencouraging  about all  the  commentary this  morning and  the  reports wehave  seen  about  the  resiliency  of  the  economy  is  that  no  one  is  sayingthat  this  is  a  result  of  good old-fashioned, pump-priming monetary andfiscal  stimulus,  but  rather  it  is  what markets  do.  When depressantsare absent,  markets  tend to  create  a process by which an  economyexpands.  If  that  is  a valid interpretation of  the  dynamics at  workout  there, then  I don't  think we have  to  be  nearly as  concerned aboutan  increase  in  inflation as  we  would if  we  were concluding  that  eithermonetary or  fiscal  policy was pumping up  aggregate demand.  Thatrelates  to  my earlier  concern when  I asked Mike  Prell  about  theGreenbook, but we will  have  to  discuss  that  another  time.  I am stillnot  comfortable  with the  Greenbook projection  of  inflation  for 1997;  Iwould  like  to  see  it  lower.  If  I  firmly believed  that  the  Greenbookwas  correct  and we would have yet  another year of  about  3 percentinflation, I would find  that  unacceptable.  So,  I have  to  conclude bysimply hoping  that  they are wrong.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I think  the  change  in  the data,  the closing  ofthe  government,  and  the  snow have allowed us  to  forget  there are  stillthree  unresolved issues  in the  economy.  The  first  I would call  thelabor market/household sector  issue.  I think the  story is  that we3/26/96-21-can't  go  on  like  this,  but  I do  not know how  it will  change.  Theanecdotal  comments  around the  table universally have  referred to  tightlabor markets.  That  is  what  I hear  anecdotally  as  well.  I was  inIndianapolis  two weeks  ago  and,  as  they phrased it  there,  "you can'thire people  at  any wage."  I won't  comment on  their  economic  logic,but no  one was  raising wages  at  the  time  they were saying  they  couldnot hire people  at  any wage!  We have had very  low increases  innominal  and real  wages.  That  is  inconsistent  with reported laborsubstantially  faster  than wage income,  and the  gap has  been  financedby higher debt  levels.  This  situation is  going to  be  resolved eitherthrough greater wage claims  in  a more  militant  labor market, whichcould be  financed  incidentally by  foregoing any further  increases  inthe  share  of  profits but  would require  at  least  a stabilization  in  theprofit  share,  or  through  curtailed  spending at  some point.The  second unresolved  issue  is  fiscal policy.  We  thought  wewere going  to begin  to  see  it  get  resolved, but  the  fact  is  that  westill  have  unsustainable  entitlement policies  in place.  Theentitlements  will have  to  be  cut at  some point.  The market  hasto  defer  the  decision still  further.If  that  is  the  case,  I think  it will  lead  to what  I see  as  athird unresolved issue,  the  level  of  prices  in  capital  markets.  Thatlevel  is  one  of  the reasons  why we  have  been enjoying an  investmentboom;  in  fact,  the  investment boom and  rising prices  in  the  equityhas  made equity  capital  very cheap and has  allowed the double-digitrate  of  growth  that  has occurred in  gross private  domestic  investment.Focusing  on  the  computer  issue,  when we  have  a deflator that  isactually deflating, the  effective hurdle  rate  of  return needed  tojustify a purchase becomes  quite high.  That's because  the nominalprice  of  the  good  is  going  down, and  in  addition we need  a positivenominal  return  on  the  capital.  To  justify buying a computer now, wehave  to  add  the  12  percent decline  in  the  deflator to  a 6 or  7 percentrate  of  return  on  the  cost  of  capital,  a total  return  of  18  or  19percent.  There  just are  not many investments  in  that  sector  that  canbe  justified on  that  basis,  and at  some  point  such  investment  is  goingto  end.  It  will  end more  quickly if  in  fact  the  cost  of  capital  risesat  the  same  time.  That  in  turn will  depend on how the  labor marketand  fiscal policy issues are  resolved.  If we  end up with  greater wageclaims  or if  we  end up with a decision  to  defer  the entitlementsreform,  we will  see  a  substantial  further  increase  in  intermediate  andlong rates,  and  that will precipitate  a market  adjustment.  On  theother hand, if  we  see  curtailed spending  by both  the  household  sectorand  the public  sector, we probably will  see  a decline  in  the  share  ofprofits  and a decline  in  investment as  a result.I think that  the weather hiatus  has allowed us  to  forget  thatwe still  have  some  fundamental unresolved  issues.  The Greenbook  isforecasting a  sustained middle  course  on how the  economy will  resolvethose  issues.  The  risks  around that  middle  course  are probablybalanced  at  this  point,  but  I think  those  risks  are growing.  In  fact,especially  in the  sixth and seventh year of  an  economic  expansion,there  is  an  increasing probability that  the  expansion will  not be  ableto  stay on  the middle  course  but will  fall  to  one  side  or  the  other.3/26/96-22-

Asbackground  for your policy discussion,  I thought  it  might  be useful  totake  a closer  look  at  a key  development  in  financial  markets  over  theintermeeting period,  the  rise  in  long-term  interest  rates  that  anumber  of you have mentioned.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Why don't we break forcoffee?[Coffee  break]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  get started.  In  a period likethis,  it  may be  a good  idea  to  review history to  see  how we got  towhere we  are.  At  the moment,  the  economy might  be  described by anelectrocardiogram  that  does  not  say the  economy is  dead but  indicatesit  is  functioning  in a way that  suggests  something  is  going  to move--as  a number  of you,  including Governors  Kelley  and Lindsey, havestated.  The  one  thing  that  is  reasonably  certain  is  that  the  outlookdepicted by the  electrocardiogram  in  the  Greenbook is  very unlikely  toprevail.  The key questions  are:  In which direction is  the  economygoing and how is  it  going  to  get  there?  A  critical  element  in  thisoutlook  is  the  interplay  of  asset  values,  specifically bond and  stockvalues,  and inventory  changes.  What  is  really quite  extraordinaryabout  this  period is  that  despite what we continue  to  envisage  as  anincreasingly  service-related economy and  one where business  firms  areincreasingly getting control  over  their  inventories,  inventoryinvestment  has been  the most  volatile  element  and  the greatestdeterminant  of  economic  change  in  the  last  two  or  three years.In  the  early part  of  the  1990s,  as  firms  finally weretechnologically capable  of  moving  toward just-in-time  inventorymanagement,  inventory-sales  ratios  moved down precipitously.  You mayrecall  that  in  the  latter part  of  1993  one of  the  reasons we began  toget a  little concerned about  the  upturn  and potential  strength of  theeconomic  recovery was  that  inventory-sales  ratios  were getting to  apoint  that  seemed  to be  close  to bottom.  Obviously,  the  arithmetic  ofa change  from a declining  inventory-sales  ratio  to a  flat ratio  is  a"pop" in  inventory  investment.  Indeed,  it  "popped" more  than  Ibelieve we  had expected, creating a significant  surge in  economicactivity throughout  1994.  Presumably  through the  normal multipliermechanisms,  the pickup  in  inventory investment  induced  enough incomeand  PCE  to  create  fairly strong  economic  growth.  A big pickup  inprofit margins  was  superimposed on  that,  which in  turn  fostered growth3/26/96-23-in  the capital  goods markets  until we  ran  into  the wall  in early  1995when voluntary inventory accumulation  temporarily  turned involuntary.Final  demand slowed appreciably,  and you may recall  that  in June,  oreconomy was  on  the  edge  of  a recession.  The economy worked its  waythrough  that,  but  inventory investment  continued  to  fall  throughout1995  as  business  firms  endeavored to  restore  some  degree of  normality.In  the  early months  of  1996,  were  it  not  for  the weatherproblems  that  dominated  a  substantial part  of  our  economy,  estimatedat  as  much as  one-third, plus  the government  shutdowns, we  probablywould have begun  to  see  some  economic  strength after  the retardationin  economic growth  that  the  inventory adjustment  engendered allthrough  1995.  The experience  of  California, where weather  was notmuch of  a problem, suggests  that  quite possibly  the  turn occurred atthe beginning  of  the  year rather  than  in February as  shows  up  in  a lotof  our  data.  At  the moment,  we can  look back and ask  ourselves whythe  economy held up,  or as  Ed Boehne put  it,  was  so  resilient  throughall  of  this period.  I think  the  answer  is  largely that  we had a verysubstantial increase  in  stock and bond market  prices.  There hasclearly been a wealth effect  here.  As  in previous periods,  it wasquite  likely  that  the  turn in  inventory  investment  could have  tiltedthe  economy into  a recession,  considering that  the  expansion is  morethan five  years  "long  in  the  tooth"  so  to  speak.  I think the  equityand bond markets  were especially helpful  in  creating a degree  ofresilience  that  has  carried  the  expansion  into  1996.The economy  is  likely  to  be stronger rather  than weaker  inthe period  immediately ahead  if  for no  other  reason  than that  it  willbe getting  some  stimulus  from the  GM strike.  The  strike  in retrospectmotor vehicle  inventories was  held by General  Motors.  While  I don'tknow the  configuration of  the  inventory decline  in  terms  of  particularmodels, because  invariably such declines  are not  uniform nor  are  theythe  same  as  a voluntary decline,  clearly  there has been  some  signifi-cant pressure  on  the  economy  that  will  be reversed as  we move  intomembers  regard the  risks  to  the  economy  as  being  as  close  to  balanceas  one  has seen  for quite  a while.  In  looking back at  the performanceof  the  economy  in  this  period, I must  say  it  was  the most probableresult  that we  could have  anticipated, but  attaining  that  outcome  wasfraught with potential  uncertainties.I disagree with Tom Melzer's  characterization of  what  takingout monetary policy  insurance means.  As  I see  it,  taking  out  insur-ance means  that we  are  adjusting policy on  the basis  of  a risk  to  theforecast  that  has a  low probability of  occurring.  In  fact,  that  isthe basis  for  all  insurance.  We take  out  fire  insurance  because weforecast  that  there  is  some  small  probability of  fire.  I don't  thinkwe  take  out  monetary policy  insurance when we  think that  the  economictrend has  changed  fundamentally.  A  fundamental  change  in  our  forecastcalls  for  a policy response  in  the  appropriate  direction, whereas  Ithink an  insurance  takeout  is  done  largely on  the basis  of  a forecastof  something  that  we  do  not expect  to  occur.  The  fact  that  it  did nothappen  in  this case,  or at  least  it has  not  happened yet,  is  adesirable  outcome.  I would be  very much  disturbed  if  it  were  theother way around.  You  can look  at  insurance any way you want.  I liketo  take  out  insurance.  I have  a  lot  of  personal  insurance.  I have3/26/96-24never  collected on  any of  it,  and  I must  say that  I am delighted.[Laughter]  And I hope that  that  is  exactly what  we will  say laterwith respect  to  what we have been doing.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  The premium isn't  fixed  in  this  case;  that  isthe  difference.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let's  not get  into  insurance policies![Laughter]  More  generally,  to  confront  the problems  that  we  face,  wehave  to  ask ourselves what  can change.  Two  issues  have  surfaced  inthe  discussion  around this  table  that,  I think,  are quite  to  thepoint.  One  is  whether we are  going  to be  looking at  increased  labormilitancy.  The answer  is  that  increased militancy is  more  likely  thannot,  if  for no  other  reason  than that  we  cannot  expect  the  currentsituation  to  continue.  As  I indicated maybe  6 or  9 months  ago whenI hypothesized that  job insecurity was  an explanation  for why wageinflation has  been  subdued, there  is  a  limit  to  this  process  at whichpoint  it  begins  to  go back  to  normal.  It  may well  be  that  politicalissues  that  have been raised during  the presidential primary campaignplus  the  General  Motors'  strike  are  the  first  signs  that  the  limit hasbeen reached.  It  is  too  early  to  say,  and  I don't  think we  have anydefinitive data to  suggest,  that  the wage-job  security  tradeoff haschanged, but  I believe we are  getting  the  first  indications  that  itThe  second and more  disturbing  issue  is  the  question of  thestock market.  The market  is  probably high by any objective measurethat we  can  find.  We  need a lot  of  different  assumptions  to  arguethat it  will  stay  there.  It  is  being driven largely by  long-terminterest  rates,  but  there  is  more  to  it  than that.  Earnings  are  stillcoming  in  above expectations.  This  is  the Wall  Street  evaluation.It's what  a series  of  analysts  expect  earnings  to  be company-by-company.  Those  numbers have  been  coming  in better  than expected  forquite a while,  although the margin  is  now changing very materially.There  is  increasing  evidence  that  profit margins,  after  showing somesignificant  strength,  are finally  beginning to  soften  somewhat,  asMike  Prell  indicated with  his  markup ratio  analysis.  This  obviouslyhas  significant  implications  for  the  capital  goods markets  at  somepoint  and  far more  impact with  respect  to  the question  of  what  stockprices  are  going  to  do.What  I find particularly bothersome  is  that  history  suggestsmore  often than not  that  stock prices  remain high  for  a protractedperiod of  time  when they  should not;  stock prices may just  be waitingfor  us  to  move rates  up before  they go  down.  We probably are going  tofind ourselves  in  that  position one way or  another  at  some  point.  ButI do  think we have  to  be  aware  of  the  fact  that  this  may be unlike1987  when the  stock market decline  essentially took out virtually allof the  overheat,  if  I may put  it  that  way, in  the  economy,  increasedthe  saving  rate  about  a full  percentage point,  and barely affectedeconomic  growth.  In a sense,  it went  through  fat  and never quite hitmuscle.  There  is  very little  fat  left  in  the  economic system at  thisstage.  If  we get  a very  significant contraction  in  stock prices,  Ithink it  will have  a quite measurable wealth effect.  Therefore,  it  isvery difficult  to  look  into  the  future  and merely presume  that  1996and  1997  will  produce  a flat  electrocardiogram.  It  is  probably thebest  forecast and  the most  likely outlook  simply because  it  isdifficult  to  figure  out where  the  extremes  are.  But one  thing that  we3/26/96-25-can  forecast  is  that  we probably  are going  to  be  surprised by morerather  than less  volatility in  the  economy.  I do  not know  in whichdirection the  economy will  be  going,  though ultimately  it  will  godown.  It will  go  down basically because  if  we  seriously believe, as  Ithink  every one  of  us  has  said  around  this  table,  that  the  businesscycle  is  not dead,  recession  is  going  to  look us  in  the eye at  somepoint.  We  do not  know when,  but  I think one  of  the mostextraordinarily difficult  periods  for monetary policy lies  somewhereahead.For  the moment,  listening to  the  consensus  on  the  economicoutlook and the  balance of  risks,  I would subscribe,  and  I hope  therest  of you will  also,  to  doing nothing today.  This  is  what  thewe are.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  An obvious  symmetry.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  the  "B"symmetric proposal.  I agree that  the most  likely  forecast  is  the  onethat we all  agreed on,  and  I think it  also  is  highly unlikely  that  itwill materialize.  We will  have  to  adjust  one way or  the other  andstay extremely wary and  ready to move  in  the  interim.  But  certainlyfor now,  the  "B" symmetric proposal  is  the  right  one.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, much of  the  evidence  that  we havereceived since  the  last  meeting suggests  that  economic  activity hasstrengthened,  as  the  gains  in  February have  more  than made up  for  theweakness  in  January.  Even with  the  GM strike  this  month,  it  nowappears  that  there will be a marked pickup  in  real growth  in  thecurrent quarter  as  a whole.  At  the present  time,  there appears  to  belittle upward  or downward pressure  on inflation, although  I do  thinkthat  the  inflation risks  are on  the  up side.  Accordingly,  I wouldagree with your recommendation  that we make no  change  in policy atthis  time.  It  seems  to  me that  further  easing  would be  inappropriate,given the  increasing  strength of  the  economy  and  the risks  that  thiscould lead  to  higher  inflation in  the  future.  It  would also  seemprudent  to  me  to wait  for  more information before we decide  on ournext  action.  If  economic  activity continues  to  pick up,  it  might  soonbe  appropriate to  increase  the  funds rate.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I agree with your recommendation.  I havesome  concerns,  obviously, based on what  I have  said before.  It  isdifficult  to  evaluate  the  stance  of policy, but  I am concerned that  ithappening, for  example, with monetary growth  rates  and some  of  thefactors  that  Don mentioned.  I think  the  current policy stance  isinappropriate given  the 3 percent  inflation  expectations.  In my view,we ought  to  be in  a somewhat  restrictive policy stance  and be workingthe  rate  of  inflation down  in  some orderly  fashion.  But having saidthat,  I don't  think it  is  appropriate  for  policy to  go  in onedirection at  one meeting and in  the  other direction at  the  next,3/26/96-26-certainly under  the  circumstances  we have  described today.  We arewhere we are, and we  should stay there  for a while and watch.  But weneed to  be  vigilant  so  that--I am going to  stick with  this  insuranceanalogy a little  longer--the premium  on  last  meeting's  insurancepolicy in  terms  of  higher  inflation expectations  does  not becomeonerous.  That  is  what  I meant before when  I said  that,  in  effect,  thepremium  is  not  fixed.  There  is  a cost  to  it.One  other point  I wanted to make quickly refers  to Don'sbriefing.  Don, you made a statement,  if  I heard it  correctly, aboutthe  Committee's opportunistic  inflation  strategy, which  implied  thatthe Committee  had actually adopted  that.  By default,  that may bewhere we  are, but  I don't  think we ever  consciously made a decisionabout what  our inflation strategy ought  to be, whether  it  isdeliberate,  opportunistic,  or  whatever.  I just wanted to  make  thatcomment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  as  others have  said, we  oftenevaluate  the economy  and the  outlook in  terms  of  risks  and how theyare balanced.  It would certainly  seem that  there has  been some  changein  the balance  of  risks  away  from  the downside  risks  toward upsiderisks.  I don't  know whether we want  to  call  it  insurance or  whatever,but  at  the  last meeting  I think there was  a perception  that  the  riskswere more heavily balanced or  tilted toward the  down  side  than  theyare now.  That  balance  seems  to  have changed.  On  those grounds  Ithink we have  to  contemplate  the  possibility that we may need  toreverse  the move we made  last month at  some point  in  the not  toodistant  future.  I certainly would not  recommend  doing that now.  Iwould agree with your proposal.  But  if  the  data for  the month  ofretail  sales  or unemployment--show continuing strength,  I think wewill need to  consider  seriously  the  possibility of  reversing ourpolicy course at  a fairly early date.  In  that regard,  I would pointout  that we have a long  interval before  the  next  FOMC meeting, whichis  on May 21.  If  we begin to  get  these numbers  for March early inwould hope  that  we might  have  a conference call  to  consider how wemight want  to  react  to  them.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I also  agree with your recommendation, Mr.Chairman.  I would  like  to  reflect  a little on your  comments  aboutreaching  the  end of  the  business cycle  expansion  sooner or  later.Obviously, that will happen.  The concern  I would have  is  that wemight experience a pattern somewhat  like  the  late  1980s  when prior  tothe  end of  the  expansion phase  of  the business  cycle, we had a surgein  inflation  that we had to  tamp  down,  thus  feeding  into  the end ofthe  business expansion  and adding  to  the depth of  the  recession.  I ama little nervous  about that possibility at  this point  and concernedthat we  should, on  assessing  the  data as  we go  forward, be  vigilant onthe  side  of  keeping interest rates  and monetary policy restrictive3/26/96-27-enough  to  prevent  a surge  in  inflation  that ultimately would  tend toshorten rather  than extend  the  growth phase  of  the business  cycle.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I agree with  leaving  the  federal  funds rate  at5-1/4 percent  at  the present  time.  But  in  the  context  of  AlBroaddus's  suggestion about  monitoring  the  incoming  information andwhat  the  yield curve  is  telling us  and  try to  reach some  consensusabout  it.  In his  remarks,  Don traced what was happening  in  theforward and  futures  markets.  I was  on  the Morning Call  during  thisperiod  and paid more  than  usual  attention  to  daily movements  ininterest  rates.  The  yield curve at  the  end of  January and  in  earlything  that was  at  5-1/4  percent was  the  overnight  federal  funds  rate.The  rest  of  the yield curve--3-month bills  on  out  to  the  30-year bond--was priced  to  be  at  least  50  basis points  lower by Labor  Day.  Idon't  know what  people have  in  mind in the way of  a transmissionmechanism of  monetary policy  to  real  economic  activity, but  I thoughtthat  the  markets  simply were well  ahead  of us  for whatever  reason:perceptions  of  a weak  economy,  inflation expectations,  or  whatever.They simply  readjusted to  economic developments  and that  had  tohappen.  In  that  sense,  we  had a relative  movement  toward lessstimulus even  though  the  funds  rate  did not  change,  and it  should notchange  for  the  time  being.  But  as  we  interpret numbers  in  the  futureand decide how to  react  to  them,  I think we need  to be  very, verycareful  about whether  the market  is  ahead of  us,  behind us,  orwhatever.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I agree with your  suggestion.  It  seems  to methat  the need  for additional  insurance  is  less pronounced.  The costis  now simply  too high relative  to  the  risk.  The  economy  is  movingforward, and  it  does not  appear  to  need  our help  at  this  time.  I canwell  imagine  that  our  next move  could be either up  or down.

In the  context  of  the  Committee's  long-runobjectives  for  price stability and  sustainable  economic  growth,  andgiving careful  consideration  to  economic,  financial,  and monetarydevelopments,  slightly greater reserve  restraint  or  slightly lesserreserve  restraint would be  acceptable  in the  intermeeting period.
