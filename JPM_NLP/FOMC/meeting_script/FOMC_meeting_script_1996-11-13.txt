CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning,  everyone.  The  first  itemof business  is  to  welcome John Moore, who  as  you know is  First VicePresident  of  the  San Francisco Bank  and is  attending his  firstmeeting.  It  means  that  Peter Fisher has  to be  on his best  behavior!

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Why me?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But before  he  exhibits  that  goodbehavior,  I would like  somebody to move  approval of  the minutes  forthe meeting  of  September 24.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I move  it,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Now, Mr. Fisher.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter  on either  subject?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I would  like  to  congratulate Peter  on his  recordperiod of nonintervention.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I would like  to  second that.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Congratulate  the  Chairman

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  I think congratulations  are  due at  theother end of  the  table, but  since  I get  beat up  occasionally downhere,  I will  take  what  I can get!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  you had not run  the  Desk as  well  asyou  did, we would not have  had a choice  up here.  If  there  are  noquestions  on  either  subject, would somebody  like  to  move the  renewalof  the  reciprocal  currency arrangements,  which expire  during  December,and  ratification of  the domestic  transactions?  We will  votemotion on  renewing the  swap  lines?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The Committee would be giving  me the  authorityto negotiate  their renewal.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So  move, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All  in favor  of  the  authority  to  renewthe  swap  lines  say  "aye."

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Aye.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  opposed?11/13/96

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Hearing none,  they  are approved.  Thesecond motion--

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  To  ratify  our domestic operations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All  in  favor say  "aye."

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Aye.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Opposed?  The Secretary will  note  thatboth motions passed unanimously.  Would you  like  to move  to  ourdomestic discussion?  [Laughter]  Wait  a second!  Have we  ratified thedomestic market  transactions?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Yes,  we  did.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Oh,  that was  the  second vote!

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We are  just moving  too  fast!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  the  trouble  is  jet  lag,  and eventhough Peter and  I were  on  the  same plane, his jet  lag  is  differentfrom mine.  [Laughter]  Slowing  things  down, we move  to Mike  Prell.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mike, granted all  the  problems with thedata, there  seems  to be  a gradual uptrend  in  the  last  two  or  threeyears  in  the  measured personal  saving rate  in  the  context  of a veryrapid rise  in household wealth.  If we were  to  take  the publishedpersonal  saving rate and adjust  it  for  the  econometric  evidence  of  theimpact of  changes  in  household wealth on  that  statistic,  is  there anyquestion as  to whether  we would be  looking at  a secular updrift?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  there always  is  a question about thebehavior of  the  saving rate, particularly when we  are estimating  itahead of  the  annual  revisions  of  the  NIPAs.  We have  seen saving ratetrajectories  altered considerably by  those  statistical  revisions.Given that we  feel  that GDP  growth may have been underestimated, it  isnot  inconceivable  that  a part  of  those revenues  could be  inconsumption expenditures.  I do not  have any particular  insight  onthat,  but  that may be  one  aspect of  the  situation  that  should make  onecautious  about  jumping  to  conclusions.  But  on  the  face of  it--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  any correlation between  thesaving rate and the  statistical  discrepancy?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I cannot give you an  answer to  that  off  the  topof  my head.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would assume  that Commerce would bedoing that  sort  of  analysis  in  looking  for  the  causes of  thestatistical  discrepancy  and presumably making adjustments where  theycould.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Obviously, each time  they do  their quarterlyestimate,  they try  to  reconcile  the  income  and product  sides.  If  theyfind income  is  stronger,  they  are presumably going to  look  for11/13/96opportunities  to  find product  and add it  in.  But  I think they arelimited by their  source data.  And now they are running behind on  theupdating of  the benchmarking to  Census  surveys  and so  on because theywere  unable to  do  their regular  annual revisions.  That  said, andrecognizing  that  the  data may be  throwing us  a curve,  one would haveanticipated over  the past couple  of  years,  all  other  things  equal,that  the  saving rate would have  declined appreciably  in  light  of  thatincrease in  wealth.  The  saving rate  might have been depressed by 1/2to  3/4 percentage point  this  year  relative  to  a path that  would beconsistent with a stable wealth-to-income ratio,  say,  since  the  end of1994.  The apparent updrift  that we have  seen  creates a considerabledifferential  from that,  and so we  look to  other possible factors.  Oneof  them, as  we have  noted for  some time, may be the  fact  that  thewealth  gains  are not  evenly distributed across  the population.  Aconsiderable number of  households  that  have built  up  debts may now berestricting their  spending.  The  tightening  of credit availability hascontributed something,  even if  it has not been very great  to  thispoint.  Earlier we were seeing a liberalization of  credit  availabilityand that  could have been enhancing  consumption growth;  now the  crediteffect presumably is  moving  in the  other direction.  We  also  haveoffered a laundry list  of  other rumored  factors  that may be affectingthe  saving rate such  as  greater  concerns about retirement  security,particularly in  light  of  the perception that  Social  Security may notbe there  fully for people now in the workforce;  Medicare and Medicaidissues  that might  suggest  less  security about medical  coverage  lateron;  and the  general notion  of  job  insecurity.  While we  do not  seeclear evidence  that by historical  standards people  are unusuallyuncertain  at  this point  about job prospects,  there remains somegeneral  sense  that  all  is not well  and that  jobs  are not secure,  sothere  could be some rise  in precautionary  saving levels.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  one  interesting aspect of  the  forecast  isthe  strength  of  consumption.  PCE  goes up  2.7  percent  in  1997.  Iassume that  one  of  the  reasons  is  the  strong  growth of  income--youhave a strong  2.7  percent  increase  in real  disposable income.  A bitof a puzzle  to me  is why there  is  such a difference between the  growthof  real  disposable income and  that  of  real GDP.  The  0.5  percentdifference is  greater  than anything we have  seen  in the  1990s,  and Ido not  know how far back one would have  to go  to  see  that  kind ofdifference  in  the  growth of  those  two measures.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  do have  some  increase  in real wages.  We havediminishing profit shares.  So,  some shift  is  occurring  in  incomeshares.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  is  also  the  CPI-product price.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Consumer energy prices,  in particular,  rosequite  rapidly this  year and are expected to  be  flat next  year.  Theswing we  get  there acts  to  boost  growth of  disposable  income.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  They push up  real  disposable  income?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Yes.  Because we are  a net  importer of  oil,helps push up  disposable  income.11/13/96

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  So maybe what  one  is  using  for  the deflator  showsup  in disposable  income versus GDP?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  That  is  consistent with the historicalevidence.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mike,  I am particularly interested in  thesemethodological  changes  that BLS  is  making  in  the  calculation of  theCPI.  You have a table on page  15  of  Part  I of  the  Greenbook thatshows  how these affect  the CPI  going out  through  1998.  Could you tellus more  about  this?  I have a couple  of  questions.  Is  the BLSplanning other changes  going  forward?  To  what extent have  the  changesmade  so  far  chipped away at  the  1/2  to  1-1/2  percent estimate weindicated before  in  testimony about  how much  the CPI  actuallyoverstates  the  true underlying inflation  rate?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I should defer  to our  foremost  authority on  this,Mr.  Stockton.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  At  this point, President Moskow,  I think whatwe have built  into  the  forecast  through 1998  is  all  that  the  BLS hasofficially announced in  terms  of planned changes.  If we  pressed them,I am sure  they would say that  they have  an ongoing program  forimprovement  and there will be  further  changes  down the  road.  Thusfar,  we  think  the  changes  they have made have reduced the  CPI  byroughly  .2 percentage point  in  1996  relative to  the  12-month change wewould have  looked at using the  1994  methodology.  So,  we  already have.2 percent  built  into the  data  to  date, and we  are expecting another.3 percent  downward correction going  forward between 1996  and 1998.In  terms  of how that  affects  our  current estimates  of  thebias,  according  to a paper published earlier  this year  by mycolleague,  David Wilcox,  the  estimated bias  is  .6 to  1.5  percentagepoints.  That estimated bias  incorporated a number  of  the  improvementsthat we  expected the  BLS  would be making.  What we  had not anticipatedwas  the  change  that  the  BLS will be making in January  to  themeasurement  of medical  care  prices, which we think  is  going  to  reducethe  CPI by  .1 percentage point.  I guess we would adjust  that  range of.6 to  1.5  percent by  lowering  it  by  .1 percentage point,  but  that  isall.  So,  we would say a range  roughly of  1/2  to  1-1/2 percent  isstill  a reasonable estimate  for  the measurement bias.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I should note  that  our estimates  of  the effectsof  these  changes  in method, or  the  market  basket change  in  1998,  aresomewhat  conjectural.  It  is  not  a simple, mechanical  arithmeticstory, and  that  is  truer  in  some  cases  than  in  others.  But  these areestimates;  they are not  engraved in  stone.  I would remind  theCommittee  that  the  Boskin Group is  slated  to  come  out with their  finalreport  on the  bias  by December.  I do not  think we have  any insideinformation  on whether  they will be revising their estimates  up  ordown, but  there certainly will  be  considerable  focus  on  the  issue  atthat  time.11/13/96

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  But  if  it were not  for  these methodologicalchanges, you would see  a gradual updrift  in  the  core rate  of  CPIinflation?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That  is  right, yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I have a question on  the material you sent uslast  night.  On  the basis  of  the  inventory data that were releasedlast  week, I see  that  you  reduced your estimate  of  third-quarter GDPgrowth to  a rate  of  1.9  percent and  traded that  off with an uptick  infourth-quarter  growth.  How sure are we  of  third-quarter final  sales?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  final  sales  for  the quarter  could bechanged at  least noticeably, maybe  not importantly, by a possiblerevision  to  September retail  sales  to  be published  tomorrow.Moreover, we have  yet  to  receive the  net exports data  for  September,which are  always  a wild card.  At  least  some  modest change  in  thatnumber  is possible,  but at  this  point we  would not expect  a majorchange  in  the  PCE  estimate based on retail  sales.  We are talkingmainly about  September.  In effect,  enough of  the  quarter  is  known atthis point  that  there  is not  going to  be a big surprise.  In  addition,there  is  only one more month of  trade data.  So,  we  know it  was a weakquarter  for  final  sales.The  inventory  situation is  harder to  gauge at  this point.Built  into  the  estimate that we gave you is  the BEA assumption aboutretail  inventory investment.  It  is  a moderate number.  We  did not  seeany  reason to  quarrel with it,  but  the  translation of  these  data  intoreal  inventory  change  is  difficult.  There is  a further wild card herein  that  a lot  of  the  surprise  in the wholesale  trade  inventory numberswas  in  food products.  There  is  some  question about whether BEA mightstill  on  the  farm and maybe  some  adjustment  should be made  in  farminventories.  Nothing  that  we have been able  to  glean  from discussionswith BEA or  from  their previous behavior would lead us  to  assign  ahigh probability of  their making  some ad hoc  adjustment here,  but  itis  a possibility.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So you are  still  quite confident  that  the  lowlevel  of  consumption recorded in  the  third quarter, despite  changes  ininventories,  is  pretty much  baked in  the  cake?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think the  numbers will  probably hold up  fairlywell.  As  I said,  they may not be  accurate numbers,  but we have  nobasis  for  gauging a bias  one way or  the  other.  We  do not perceivethat  the  trend in  the growth of  consumption has moderated to  thedegree  that  those  third-quarter numbers  might suggest.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  My question actually was  the  same  as  Cathy's.It  was  about  the  GDP estimate.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  If  I'm asked again,  I might give  a differentanswer!11/13/96

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Well,  actually I was going to put  it  slightlydifferently.  How confident  are you about  the  1.9 percent  growth rate?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Not highly confident, given  the  statisticaluncertainties  that  I indicated.  We can  imagine  a number a littlelower;  we  can  imagine a number  a little higher.  You will  recall  thatone  of  the  fundamental  factors  in  our thinking about  the  third quarterwas  that  the  labor  input was  quite ample,  and the  income  side wouldsuggest  there was room  for  considerably more growth.  On  the otherhand, when we  looked at  the  first  half  of  this year  or  the  secondquarter, we did not  always  see  these  things  tracking perfectly;  therewas  some  averaging out.  The basic  trend of  growth  in the  mid-two'sfor  this year  seems  fairly reasonable relative to  the  behavior of  theunemployment  rate,  to  other measures of  labor  input,  and to  ourgeneral  sense  that  things had picked up and were  running somewhatabove  the  long-term trend.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions  for Mike?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  When you estimate  a consumption  function, doyou divide  the population  into  subsets?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We have  some  notional views  about  proportions ofthe population  that might  be liquidity  constrained or not  liquidityconstrained.  So,  embedded in  some models  is  a perspective on  that.But  in preparing our  forecast,  we are not  thinking of  this  on adisaggregated basis.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We also  try  to  take  account of  the  distribu-tion of  income.  For example,  there  is  a much higher propensity toconsume out  of  transfer payments  than  there  is  out  of  labor income.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Transfer income has been relatively  strong,  andto  an extent  that might  lead one  to  have  expected fairly  firmconsumption relative  to  aggregate  income.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It would seem that  the potentially liquidity-constrained or  debt-constrained population would be different from  thepeople who have had stock market wealth gains.  I would  think that  thekey  to  sorting  the  two  out  is  to  try to  disaggregate the  trends.  Thisis  just  a suggestion  for  future  research.

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  As  you know, Governor Lindsey, there  are not  alot  of  disaggregated time  series  data on consumption and saving.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions?  If  not, whowould  like  to  start  the  Committee's discussion?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, the  Twelfth District  economyexpanded briskly  in  the  first half  of  1996,  and it  remained on  trackduring the  third quarter.  Growth  in  total payroll  employment  slowedonly slightly between  the  second and third quarters,  from  3.6  to  3.3percent  at  an annual  rate.  The  District's performance  this year  isattributable  largely to  a strengthening  in  the  State of  California.For  example,  growth  in construction employment  in  that  state hasaccelerated  substantially since  the  first  quarter.  The  overallexpansion  has been  stronger  in  northern California than  in other partsof  the  state.  The northern region has benefitted  from  low11/13/96unemployment and a substantial  recovery in  housing values,  factorsthat gradually are spreading  to  southern  California.  The WashingtonState  economy continues  to  benefit  from  stepped up production atBoeing.  Twelve-month gains  in  total  employment  in  the state  haveincreased from  1 percent  at  the  start  of  the  year to  3.1 percent  inaircraft production also  spilled over  to Oregon  and added  to  a third-quarter  surge  there.  The  intermountain states--Arizona,  Idaho,Nevada,  and Utah--continued to  post  large  year-over-year employmentgains.  About  the only weak part  of  the  District  is  Hawaii,  whichshowed a decline  in  jobs  during the  third quarter.Turning  to  the  national  economy, data released since we metin September  caused us  to  lower  our projections  for near-term  real  GDPand,  to  a lesser  extent,  inflation  in 1997.  We now expect  real GDPgrowth to  fall  below its  2 percent  trend this  quarter,  in part  becauseinventory investment  should drop off  following its  strong  increase  inthe  third quarter.  At  the  same  time,  inflation  in the  ECI  and theGDP-based price measures  all  came  in below expectations.  Over  alonger horizon, underlying inflation has  shown a slight  downward trendaccording  to  most measures  despite  the  low unemployment rate.We have  updated some earlier work that  looked at  conventionalinflation  equations  incorporating historical  relations amongunemployment,  inflation,  and other variables.  These equations  over-predicted inflation by  a wide margin  in the  third quarter,  and thisnoticeably intensified  the more moderate pattern of  overpredictionthat  we have  seen for  some  time.  As  a result, we have  lowered ourforecast  for CPI  inflation in  1997  to  just under 3 percent,  in  effectputting somewhat  less weight  on upward pressure from labor markets.However,  I still  consider  the risks  for  inflation  to be  on  the  up  sidebecause  it  is  quite possible that  the historical  relationship withlabor  market conditions will  begin to  reassert  itself.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, the  Seventh District  economycontinues  to  expand at  a moderate pace.  It  appears that  pricepressures may have eased somewhat.Overall  construction activity remains  strong, with recentslowing on  the  residential  side being offset  by a pickup innonresidential  activity, both public  and private.  Retail  salesimproved moderately in both  September and October,  and the  sales gainsin  the District  generally have  matched or  slightly exceeded thenational  averages.  One  of  our  directors  characterized the recentpickup  as  representing steady gains  rather than  indicating a newtrend.  Sales  of  apparel  and other  soft goods have  been  strong, whilesales  of  big-ticket  items  such as  appliances  and, especially,electronic goods  have  been soft.  District  retailers generally expecta reasonably healthy holiday  sales  season, and the  shorter  salesperiod  this year  is  not expected to  be  a serious  constraint.  As  wehad expected, auto  and light  truck sales  recently have been runningslightly below a 15-million-unit  annual pace.  October sales  were notsignificantly  affected by  the  various  strikes against GM, but Novemberand possibly December  sales  could be.  According  to GM management,downtime  from their  new model  changeovers presents a significantproduction challenge  in  the  fourth quarter.  The  new GM-UAW contract11/13/96increased  compensation costs  by just  under 5 percent per year andfollowed a pattern  that  already had been  set with Ford and Chrysler.Manufacturing activity in  the  District generally remainssomewhat  stronger than nationally, although conditions vary byindustry.  Purchasing managers'  surveys  from around our Districtindicated continued expansion in October  at a pace that  was somewhatfaster than  for  the  nation as  a whole.  We  are hearing  about  strengthin  the  farm equipment  industry, while producers of  heavy  trucks  andpaper are not reporting improvement.  Growth in manufacturingemployment has  slowed  in District  states,  but  the  number of  factoryjobs  in  September was  the  same  as  last year.  This  represents  a betterperformance  than the  rest  of  the nation.For  employment  conditions generally,  the  news  is  still  thesame.  Labor markets  remain  tight  in many parts  of  the  District.While we continue  to have  reports  of upward pressure  on wages  in  somesectors,  the  ECI  for  the Midwest,  like  that  for  the nation, did notindicate a significant  acceleration in  total  compensation costs.Confidential  information we  received from Manpower Incorporatedregarding their recent  survey  indicates  that hiring plans  for  thefirst  quarter  of  1997  are  slightly more upbeat  than normal.  I wouldcaution everyone that  this  information will not  be  publicly releaseduntil Monday, November 25.On  the price  front, most  firms  continue  to  report  thatcompetitive pressures  make raising prices  extremely difficult.  Infact,  many of  our  contacts are  quite adamant  on  this point.  I get  thesense  from people  I have  talked  to  recently that materials  costs arecoming down rather  than rising.  Steel  prices,  for example, are  downand supplies  have  increased, in part because of  imports.  One  sign  ofthe  impact of  imports  is  that  at  least  two  domestic steel  companiesrecently have  filed anti-dumping charges under  our  trade laws.Our  latest  reports  on  livestock  and crop  conditions  generallypoint  to  larger  supplies  ahead than were previously expected, and thiswill  result  in less  upward pressures  on  retail  food prices  in 1997than were  previously expected.  Our  latest  quarterly survey  ofagricultural  banks  indicates  that District  farmers  are  in very goodfinancial  condition,  and we  see  no  signs  of ag  loan problems  in ourDistrict.Turning to  the national  outlook,  it  seems  clear  that  the  longawaited slowing  in  the  growth of  aggregate  demand has  arrived.  Wehave no quarrels with  the broad outlines  of  the  Greenbook's  outlookfor  1997,  but  we expect  that real  growth and employment gains may beslightly higher  in  1997  than  the  Greenbook forecast.  I think it  isfair  to  say  that the  risks  to  the outlook  are more  nearly balancedthan  at  our  last meeting, but  I believe  that  the  upside  risks  remainmore  serious.  The  inflation  forecasts  concern me.  As  the Greenbooknotes,  the  NAIRU may have  fallen  to  5.6  percent.  Still,  this  is  aneconomy where resource  utilization rates  are high and slack  islimited.  The outlook  is  for higher  core  inflation,  as we  discussedbefore, when we  adjust  for  the  BLS's methodological  changes  to  theCPI.  Obviously, there  is  a good deal  of  uncertainty about  theseadjustments  in the  inflation  forecasts,  but  I think  it  is  importantthat we  avoid getting  into  the position of validating an  incrementalupward creep  in  inflation.11/13/96

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, New England remains on  a solidgrowth path.  Job growth on average has been  slower than  for  thenation, but  this  is  traditional  for New England.  The unemploymentrates  for  the region as  a whole  and for  each  state remain below thatfor  the nation.  Employment  in our  region is  still  below itsprerecession level,  but  the  slow, steady job growth  that  we have  beenexperiencing is  expected to  continue  for  the  rest  of  the  decade  and tobring employment back to  the prerecession level  by the  end of  1998.Just  to  touch on  some  of  the bright  spots:  Manufacturing  joblosses  are  continuing but  at  a slower  rate.  We  see  this  especially  inthe defense  industry where downsizing  is  abating,  and we  are  beginningto  see  signs  that  defense-oriented firms  are becoming successful innondefense  lines  of  business.  Real  estate vacancy rates  are  downeverywhere,  especially in Boston.  A director on  our New EnglandAdvisory Council  heads up  the building  trades  in Boston, and hereports  that  new buildings  are actively on the  drawing boards,including six new hotels and  a couple  of  new office  complexes.  When Iarrived in  Boston five years  ago,  that was  not  expected to  happen inanyone's  lifetime.  Despite  low rates  of  unemployment,  anecdotalreports  of  labor shortages,  except  for specific  technical  skills,appear  to have  abated in  the  last couple  of months.  There is  somesense  that  the New England  labor  force may be  growing.  There  is  lessnet  outmigration and perhaps  greater labor  force participation bypreviously discouraged workers,  especially older workers.  Wageincreases  are  expected to  be  in  the area  of  2 to  5 percent,  probablycentering  around 3 percent,  but pressures  on overall prices  areconsidered to  be  low.  Business  people firmly believe,  along the  linesthat  Mike  Prell  reported  for  the nation,  that  they  cannot raiseprices.  Some are  going  to  try, but overall  the  expectation  is  thatwhatever happens on  the wage  side, businesses will  somehow accommodateto  it  within their  overall  cost structure  and not  raise  prices.Consumer  sentiment and business  sentiment  are extremelyupbeat,  even in  such formerly depressed areas  as  Connecticut.  We  havehad people  from Connecticut  talking to  us  about  business  conditionslooking brighter.  The stories  in  the  newspapers are  more optimistic,and that  is  not  because  they  just opened a new Indian-run casino  inConnecticut!  I think  the better  sentiment  has  its  roots  in  theopening of  a lot  of  small new businesses.On  the national  scene,  we do  not have  any  essentialdisagreement with  the Greenbook.  Certainly, the  risks  that  growthwill  get  out  of  hand seem  to  have  abated since our  last meeting.  Theslower  growth in  consumer  spending  in  the  third quarter,  a slightcooling  of  housing markets,  and a bigger drag--bigger  than we  expectedanyway--from the  trade  deficit all  point  to  a moderate  fourth quarter,even  assuming  a fairly good bounceback  in consumer  spending.  Therisks  to  the  forecast  for growth also  seem  fairly balanced, at  leastfor  the  coming year,  again as  compared with our  expectations at  thetime  of  the  last Greenbook.  However,  there  are  continued  upside risksto  inflation.  The  Greenbook may be  overly optimistic  about  theunemployment rate.  It  could very well  drift  slightly downward, atleast  in  our view, and we  do not  have  a whole  lot  of  wiggle room  here.The NAIRU probably  is  lower  than we expected earlier,  eitherpermanently or  cyclically, but  it certainly  is  not  centered  around 5.211/13/96-10-percent.  The Greenbook inflation  trend is  up,  even  though that  getsmasked a bit  by measurement  adjustments  and so  forth.  But  if  we wereable  to make all  of  those adjustments  going backward, we would stillexpect  to  see a small  uptick  in  the rate of  inflation going  forward.The  key question here  is  whether that  expected upward tick  ininflation  is  acceptable,  and if  it  is  not, when we  should move  toaddress  it  even  in  the  presence of  moderating economic growth.

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, activity at  the  regional  levelin our District,  as  elsewhere  in  the  country, has decelerated prettymuch across  the board.  In particular, residential  constructionrecently has  softened noticeably.  Our most  recent monthly surveys,though,  do  suggest  a bit of  a rebound lately  in both  the  service  andthe  manufacturing sectors.  It  is  our  sense  that  despite thefew exceptions  like  textiles  and apparel.  In  addition,  labor marketsin our  region remain  tight  according  to  the  information  that we have,and wage pressures  are still  evident  in at  least  some  local markets,although here as  elsewhere  these conditions have  produced onlyscattered  increases  in prices  at  this point.In general,  I think  it  is  fair  to  say  that households  andbusinesses  in  our  region remain  reasonably confident  that  theexpansion  is  going  to  continue  for  the  foreseeable  future.  Onemanifestation of  this  is  continued, quite marked  strength incommercial  real  estate along the  lines  of Cathy Minehan's  comments.Mike Moskow mentioned that as  well.  As  we pointed out  in ourBeigebook report, vacancy  rates have  fallen and rental  rates  haverisen in many parts  of  the  District,  and we see  at  least  some newconstruction activity.  In Charlotte  and northern Virginiaparticularly, we  see  a lot  of  strength  in the  commercial  real  estatesector.Turning to  the  national picture,  I think  the  third-quarterGDP  report and  the  recent monthly data  are quite  encouraging onbalance because  they suggest  that  the economy  is now moving back to  amore  sustainable  growth path.  At  a minimum, it  seems  clear that  thevery rapid and  obviously unsustainable  growth rate  in  the  secondquarter  is  not  going to persist.  Moreover, and  for me  this  isprobably  the  single most  encouraging development,  the  recent drop  inlong-term  interest  rates  suggests  that  inflation expectations havediminished in a material way at  least  for now.Finally, employment growth has  moved back  closer  to  the  trendgrowth  in  the  labor  force,  and while  labor markets  remain  tight,  theyconsiderably  improved and encouraging  picture.  As  you know,  I was  notat  all  confident  that  we would get  this  kind of  outcome without  someadditional  restraint  before now on our part.  I am happy that  thingshave  worked out  this way, at  least  for  the  time being.Looking ahead, as  others  already have  noted, the  risks oferror  in the  staff's projections  are more balanced now than  they were.I did not  think  that  there was  any  significant downside risk untilrecently, but  final  demand especially  for households was  very weak  inthe  third  quarter.  I don't  think we understand this weakness  or  the11/13/96-11-related  increase  in  the  saving  rate very clearly at  this  point.  Itpossibility that  something more is  going  on, and we need  to  besensitive  to  that possibility.Having  said all  this,  I do believe,  like  Mike Moskow, thatthe  balance  of  risks  is  still  skewed  to  the up  side  on both growth  andinflation,  if  somewhat  less  dramatically than earlier.  It  iscertainly possible  that we could experience  a poor holiday sellingseason and  that  consumer demand could remain weak going  forward.  Butthis  outcome  seems unlikely  to me given what we know about  the  solidgrowth  in jobs  and incomes,  continued high consumer  confidence, andthe  behavior of  the  stock market.  Also,  the  overall  level  of  activityseems  to  remain high.  According to  all  of  the  information  that  I see,labor markets  are still  quite  tight.  The Greenbook, after all,  isstill  projecting a modest but  steady  increase  in  the  ECI  over  theprojection period  and also  in  the core  CPI,  especially abstractingfrom  the  reweighting of  the  index.  So,  again,  I  think the  risksremain weighted  to  the up  side.  Also,  even  though  the upside  riskseems  to  be diminishing  somewhat,  as  I see  it  there  is  precious  littleof  activity, and  if  we see  any  significant increase  in  aggregatedemand in  the near  term,  that  could get us  back  into  trouble  in  ahurry.  So,  bottom  line,  we need  to  remain vigilant.

MR. BOEHNE.  Economic  activity  in  the  Philadelphia Districtcontinues  to  expand,  although  the pace  of growth  has  slackened somesince  the  summer.  Manufacturing overall  reflects  this  trend.  Someindustries  like  rubber, plastics,  chemicals, primary metals,  andmachinery are  relatively stronger  than  textiles  and  furniture.Retailers are having  a better  year  to  date  than  last  year,  thoughthere has been  some  slowing  so  far  this  fall  compared to  the  summer.A number  of  retailers  have  told us  that  sales volumes  hold up  onlywhen prices  are  cut.  Construction activity generally  has  edged down,with nonresidential  construction well  under  the  levels  of  a year agoand  housing permits  somewhat above.  Labor markets  remain mixed, withsome areas  very tight and  others reporting  slack.  In  general,employers report  increased difficulty  in  finding qualified  entry-levelworkers.  A major  reason  is  that  some  minimal  level  of computer  skillsis  required for many entry-level  jobs,  especially for  clericalworkers.  There  is  also  a shortage of  truck drivers  and of  skilledtradesmen  in  construction.  In  the job  categories where  shortagesexist,  there  are  notable  upward wage pressures.  Generally, however,wage  increases  are  in  the  3 to  4 percent  range.On  the national  front,  the  economy  is  performing  according  toa script  of  more moderate, sustainable  growth and  subdued inflation.The  best-bet outlook  is  for more of  the  same,  though  something canalways  go wrong.  There  are  always uncertainties,  and there  is  alwaysroom  for  improvement.  At  the  same  time,  the macro  economy  isperforming rather well,  and monetary  tinkering at  this  point would belikely to  do more  harm  than  good.

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, many of us  indicated at  the  lastFOMC  meeting  that we were  still waiting  for  the  forecasted and hoped-for  slowdown  in  the  economy, but  as  of  that  time there were  only a fewscattered  signs of  a slowdown.  I do not  think that  is  the  case anylonger.  Indeed, while  the  Sixth District  does not  exactly mirror  thenational economy, many of  the  same  trends  that we  are seeing  withinthe  District are now appearing  in  the national  economy as well.  OurDistrict  economy continues  to  grow at  a moderate pace,  although I nolonger would suggest  that  it  is  leading  the  nation.  Signs of  aslowdown  are beginning to appear, particularly  in residentialconstruction  and manufacturing.  Tourism, a mainstay for  our District,particularly  in  Georgia and Florida,  continues  to  be extremely strong.Retail  sales  exceed year-ago levels,  and retailers  we talk  to areoptimistic  about  the  upcoming holidays.  Our real  estate  contactsreport  that  the  single-family market has begun  to  slow, albeit  from anhistorically high  level,  as both  sales  and construction activityflattened  in October.  At  the  same  time,  multifamily and commercialconstruction continue strong.  Loan demand remains  steady, withconsumer  loan  demand described as  flat and commercial  as mixed.  Banksin our  region tell  us  they  are  beginning to  pay closer attention tocredit  quality.On  the  labor market  front,  we continue to  get  reports  oflocalized  shortages, which are  in  fact becoming more  and more commonacross  the  District.  At  the  same  time,  we are hearing  of  onlyscattered wage pressures  and, as  Mike Moskow and Cathy Minehanindicated  for  their Districts,  there  are  almost no  signs  that  thistightness  is  being passed  through to  consumers  in the  form of  higherprices.  We get  few reports that  there will be  any direct  impact fromthe  increase  in  the minimum wage,  but  some  of  our business contactsindicate  that  certain wage  contracts  are  indexed  to  the minimum wageand hence  we will be watchful on  that  front.Our  outlook for  the District  calls  for moderate-to-stronggrowth well  into  next  year.  We  look  for  some  signs  of possibleslowing due  to  diminished demand.  Although  consumer confidenceremains  strong, we  see  a slight  drop  in the  willingness  to buy big-ticket  items.  And  the  regional  decline  in  loan  quality suggests  thepossibility of  tighter  loan  standards  and weaker  loan demand  in  thefuture.  Similarly, regional  capital  investment may slacken unlessmanufacturers  stop revising their capital  expenditure  plans downward.On the  national  front,  we  see  things  about  the  same  aseveryone  else does.  The  reported drop  in  third-quarter GDP growth andother more  recent monthly data  seem  to  be  signalling  the  slackeningthat  we  were  looking  for,  especially in  light  of  the  evidence thatgrowth in  consumer spending and business  investment may be  slowing.Despite  the  evidence of  some slowing  in  the  expansion, we  still  expectforward momentum to  continue  at  a good level,  with most  of  theeconomy's  fundamentals  remaining  essentially healthy.We  see  three  key question marks  for  the  forecast,  essentiallythe  same as  those  discussed in  the  Greenbook.  The  first  concernsconsumer  demand  and specifically when  it  will pick up  and by how much.We  think there  are  some upside risks  here.  As  Al  Broaddus  just  noted,personal  income  has been up, savings  have been up,  debt burdens werereduced  slightly in  October,  and the  run-up  in  the  stock market  hasgiven  consumers' holdings  of  financial wealth an added boost.  The11/13/96-13-second question relates  to  inventories,  which we have already  talkedabout.  Looking at  the  data closely,  we feel  that  a large part  of  theincrease  in  inventories  was not  a result of  an unanticipated  drop  insales but  rather  stemmed in most  cases  from attempts  to  replenishstocks.  Inventory-sales  ratios remain moderate to  low by almost  anystandard.  Of  course,  the  third factor  is  the  labor markets.  How longcan we continue  to  have  the current  job growth and unemploymentenvironment without  the  resulting  tightness beginning to  put upwardpressure  on prices?  We  think we have  been  fortunate with developmentsin  this  area  for some while  now, but  it  is  not  likely that  reducedincreases  in  benefits  can continue  to  offset wage increasesindefinitely.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. MCTEER.  The expansion of  the  Eleventh District  economyhas  slowed a little from  its  rapid pace  earlier, but  it  is  stillfairly strong.  The  strengths  certainly  outweigh the weaknesses.  Onthe up  side,  higher oil  and gas prices  are a positive for  us  at  least,boosting activity in  the  energy industry in the  Southwest.  TheMexican economy  is  rebounding,  adding to  the  demand  for  District  goodsand  services.  Nonhousing construction activity is  strong  in  theDistrict,  particularly office buildings,  warehouses, and  industrialspace.  Call  centers  are  hiring all  the people  they can get,  and thereare many reports of  labor  market tightness.  On  the down  side,  theelectronics  industry  is  weaker than a year ago.  We  have  seen about  a3 percent decline  in electronics-related  jobs  as  compared with 5percent growth over  the  previous  two  years.  Homebuilding has droppedoff  a bit.  Employment  in  motor vehicles manufacturing is  down  andmore  layoffs are  expected  in  coming months.  On  the whole,  it  isfairly clear  that growth  remains strong  in  the District,  though  it  ismoderating a little  from  its  earlier pace.Turning  to  the  question  of  upward price pressures,  the bottomline, as  other people also have  indicated, is  that we  do not  see muchevidence  of  such pressures yet.  There  has  been a lot  of  evidence bothstatistical  and  anecdotal  that  the  labor  market  is  tight  in  our partof  the  country.  On  the  other hand,  there is  little evidence  that  thetightness  is  translating  into  upward pressures  on prices.  The  laborpicture  is  interesting.  I have  heard a lot  of  stories  recently andhave  seen  some of  the problems  that  companies  increasingly areexperiencing  in  their  efforts  to  find  enough help  at  the  lower  end ofthe wage  spectrum.  We  hear of  restaurants offering signing bonusesfor new employees.  People  are  going into  7-Elevens  and getting a joboffer when they  are not  even  looking  for work.  [Laughter]

MR. STERN.  As  far  as  the District  economy  is  concerned,there  is  little to report because  the  very healthy trends  continue,  ashas  been the  case  for a long  time.  Labor markets  remain  very tight,and  I have no doubt  that  there  are outright  labor  shortages  that arerestraining activity and expansion  in some  parts  of  the  District.Anecdotes of wage pressure have  increased  and while we  are hearingmore  about  that,  the  pressure does  not  appear  to be  showing up  in anyof  the broad measures of  wages.  I am not  in a position to  reconcilethe anecdotes  in one direction  and the  data in  the  other.  Part  of  theexplanation would appear  to  be  a greater  reliance on variable pay,which seems  to  be both  larger  and going deeper  into  organizations  thanwe earlier  thought.  But  the  evidence  in  support  of  that  explanationstill  is  very  fragmentary at  this point,  and I would not  put a lot  ofemphasis  on  it.  Whatever one might  say about wages  and wagepressures,  business people remain adamant,  as  a number of  people havealready commented, that  they cannot raise  prices  and that  inflation  isnot  something  they are  confronted with or  that  they contemplate.As  far  as  the  national economy  is  concerned, I wouldcharacterize developments  in recent months  as  generally pleasantsurprises.  Inflation  has  turned out  to  be  less  of  a problem  than  Ifeared earlier, and  demand does  seem to  be  slowing along  the  linesthat we anticipated.  I am not particularly worried about  the  third-quarter  slowdown in  consumer spending.  That  story  looks  to  me likethe  dog  that does  not bark  or  did not bark.  What  I mean  is  thatretailers  are prone  to  complain and  in  fact  do  complain almost  nomatter how good  things  are.  The  fact  that  I do not  hear  themcomplaining  suggests  to  me that  sales  remain  satisfactory.I clearly do  not understand some  of  the  dynamics  in  the  laboran upward creep  in  the  rate  of  wage  increases.  But  given that weprobably have been underestimating the  rate  of  growth of productivity,it  may be  that  cost pressures  have  been offset  to  this point.  Havingsaid that,  we know  that businesses are relying  increasingly on  lessskilled, less  experienced workers  because they are  the  only  onesavailable  to  fill  vacancies,  and we may be  at  the point where  we areabout  to  run  through  the  good news  as  far  as being  able to  offsetsomewhat  higher wages with productivity  improvements.  That  is,  we maystart  to  see  real  increases  in  labor  costs  and the pressures  thatfollow  from  that.  I do  not  know how much  to  make of  that  at  thispoint because, as  I said earlier,  it  seems  to  me  that most  of  thesurprises  in  recent months  have been pleasant.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  the  economy in  the Kansas  CityDistrict  continues  to  grow moderately and consistently.  Our directorsand  other business  contacts  generally report healthy economicconditions  throughout  the District.  Retail  trade appears  to  beholding up  well  across  all  seven  District states.  A recent  survey ofDistrict manufacturers  conducted by our  Bank found that moderate11/13/96-15-expansion of  production schedules  is  in place  at  this  time.  Despitesome generally  favorable anecdotal  reports,  employment has  leveled offin recent months.  It was  unchanged  in September and up  just  a littlein August.  Improved conditions  in our  agricultural  sector have  raisedincome  levels  somewhat,  and we are seeing  some  drilling activity inour  energy sector as  well.  Overall consumer  and wholesale prices nowappear to  be  rising  slowly but  consistently across  our District.Labor markets  are  indeed  tight,  and we are hearing more frequentreports of  wage pressures  for our manufacturers as  well  as  for  ourretail  and service industries.For  the national  outlook, our projections  are very similar tothose  of  the  Board staff.  Over  the  next  several  quarters,  I look forreal GDP  to  advance at  around the  trend rate  of  2 to  2-1/4  percent.There  remains,  as  others have mentioned, some uncertainty aboutconsumption, but we  believe  that  the underlying  fundamentals  are  good.Looking at  other sectors  of  the  economy,  it  appears  that  we can expectsolid economic  growth in  the  fourth quarter.  For  example,  theindustrial  sector continues  to  expand, and housing  activity shouldremain healthy, given  the declines  we  have  seen  in  long-term  interestrates.  While we  have  a CPI  inflation rate  that  is now reported to  berunning  around 3 percent,  allowing for  the methodological  adjustmentsbeing made  to  this  measure,  that  still  reflects an  upward move  in  theinflation rate.  I think  this has been noticeable over  the  last  18months.  As  it has  in  the past,  the  rise  in  inflation continues toconcern me.  Thank you.

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  Eighth District economicconditions  continue to  be very good.  Sales  increases,  employmentgains,  and plant  expansions are  reported  far more often  than declinesand  closures.  Firms  recently  announcing plans  for  new facilitiesinclude some  in  the poultry processing, paper products,  and packagedelivery businesses.  Most  firms  report  inventories  at or  slightlybelow desired  levels.  Construction permits  for  new homes were  uprecently in more  than half  of  the  District's  12  metropolitan areas.Two District  auto manufacturers,  Chrysler and Ford, plan to  produce334,000  cars  and  light  trucks  in the  fourth quarter,  an  increase of15.2  percent  from  third-quarter  levels.  Current plans  call  for  first-quarter  1997  production to  exceed first-quarter  1996  production byabout  2.7  percent.  Also,  farm income  is  strong because  of  generallyhigh prices  and good yields.With respect  to  labor markets,  unemployment in  several  EighthDistrict  states  remains near  20-year  lows.  In  Missouri,  for example,the  September unemployment rate  was  3.9 percent,  well  below thenational  average and the  state's unemployment  rate  one year  ago.District payroll  employment  growth on  the  other  hand was  1-1/2  percentat  an  annual  rate  from June  through  September,  somewhat below thenational  average of  2-1/2  percent.  Given  other  developments,  this  mayreflect a shortage  of  qualified workers  to  fill positions  rather thanweak  labor  demand relative  to  the  nation.  District  labor markets aretight.The national  jobs  picture  is  similar.  For  1996,  the  averagegain  in nonfarm payroll  employment  has been about  209,000 per  month or2.1  percent  at  an  annual rate,  well  above  the Board  staff's  longer-run11/13/96-16-trend in  labor  force  growth of  about  130,000  workers per month.  Thenational unemployment rate,  as we  all know, was  5.2  percent  forsome  moderate wage pressure associated with these  tight  labor markets.The Greenbook notes  that  the employment cost  index  increased at  2.9percent  in the  third  quarter, up  from  2.6  percent  in  the  third quarterof  1995.  Unit  labor  costs  increased at  a 4 percent  annual rate  in  thethird quarter, about double  the  rate  in  the  first  half  of  the  year.Financial markets have  concluded that  the slowdown in  realGDP growth  has reduced the  urgency  for  immediate  action by thisCommittee.  That  may be correct, but  the  facts  are  that  in  each of  thelast  three years,  we have managed to  achieve  fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter CPI  inflation rates  a few tenths  under 3 percent.  This  year,on  the other  hand, CPI  inflation will move higher  to  an  estimated 3.2percent.  And forecasts  for next year  on a consistent  basis  are higherstill,  as was  mentioned earlier.In short,  we  are  in  the  process of violating an  implicitupper bound on  acceptable  inflation, which may cause  some  to  concludethat  the Committee's  tolerance  for  inflation  is  rising.  Furthermore,the  current  inflation rate  is  too high  in my opinion to  allow  formaximum efficiency in  the  U.S.  economy.  But because markets  believewe  are  focused solely on  short-run developments  in  the  real  economy,there  is  apparently no  rationale for  tightening unless  inflation movesup  markedly, which of  course we  all  know  is  too  late  once  it  occurs.In my view, the Committee  should develop a plan to move  inflationlower and publicize  that plan  through  an announcement  of multi-yearinflation  targets.  Lack of  transparency in policymaking  is  preventingthe  Committee  from  gaining  full  credibility and is  causing marketparticipants  to  demand  compensation  for possible  inflation  surprisesin  the  future.  While current  long-term  interest  rates  on U.S.Treasury debt  seem  low, they  could be  lower  still  if  marketparticipants were  less  worried about  inflation making a comeback.  Aclear  statement of  our  objectives and actions  consistent with thoseobjectives  could help  in  this  regard.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, the  economy  of  theSecond District advanced at  a slow but  steady pace  in recent weeks.Private payrolls  rose  at  an annual  rate  of  1.2  percent  in New York and1 percent  in New Jersey  in September.  Job growth kept  pace with laborforce  growth,  and unemployment  rates  therefore were  essentiallyunchanged.  Consumer  spending was moderately  strong.  Retail  salesgrowth remained in  its  recent range  of  4 to  5 percent.  Sales  in theexisting home market  softened a bit  but  from near-record highs  thatcharacterized recent  months.  Housing demand remained strong  and priceincreases were  reportedly in  the  range  of  5 to  6 percent.  Builderstell  us  that  construction of  single-family units  declined sharply butthat  construction of  2- to  4-family condominiums was  robust.  Thevacancy  rates  for prime commercial  office  space declined  in mostmetropolitan  areas  throughout  the  Second District,  while rental  ratescontinued  to  firm throughout  the  dominant Manhattan market.  Theconsumer price index  for  the  New York/northeastern New Jersey regionticked up  to  3.1  percent  on  a year-over-year basis.  Leaving asidemonthly gyrations,  the CPI  in our  area  has  averaged 2.8 percent  over11/13/96-17-the  last  two quarters.  That  is  about  on  a par with  the national  gainof  2.9  percent.On  the  national  level,  our  forecast  is  rather consistent  withthe views  that have  been expressed here,  at  least  those  of  theGreenbook  and of  the members who are  generally  sympathetic with  thatforecast.  The  concern we have been spending  a good deal  of  our  timelooking into  is  whether the  tightness  that  all  of  us perceive  in laborMost  economic  theory says  that  if  compensation growth does  accelerate,it will  be  passed on  to  higher prices if  labor's  share  of  costs,  laborproductivity, and the  profit margin  are  all  constant.  But  accordingto  the  research that  has  been done  throughout  the country,  the  linkagebetween the  cost  of  labor  and  the price  level  varies  from very weak  toreasonably strong.  In  fact,  the  research  that was  conducted  recentlyat  the New York Fed suggests  the  strongest  link.  But  generallyspeaking,  the  research indicates  that  the  link is  not particularlystrong,  and we have been  looking  for  the reason why that might be  so.One possible explanation we have  come up  with  in work  that  is  stillvery much in progress  is  that  expenditure categories  accounting forabout  half  the  CPI  do  not  indicate  that  changes  in  labor  costs  have asignificant direct  effect on prices.  That  is  because  either the  laborcosts  represent  a negligible  fraction of  total  costs--for example,  inexisting  housing,  food that  is  consumed at home,  or  in energy--orbecause  of  the government's  role  in price  setting as  in medical  care,tobacco, alcoholic beverages,  utilities,  and public  transportation.That  seems  to us  to  leave  the  remaining half  of  the  CPI  as  the placeto  look  for  a stronger  link between compensation and  finished prices.We find  that  labor  costs  matter  in  two areas,  but  a good dealmore  in  one of  the  two.  We  find the  linkage  quite weak  in  the  areainvolving  the production  of  goods  and the  prices of  the  goods.  Ithink that  is  the  area about  which we  hear  so  many anecdotes  sayingthat  the  labor market  is  very tight,  but  even  if  labor costs  go upbusinesses  say they cannot pass  them  on  to prices.  The  competitivenamely, labor-intensive  services  that  account  for  about  23  percent  ofthe  CPI,  where there  is  not  so  much discipline on pricing, at  leastnot any  that  is  close  to being comparable  to  that  of  the  goodsproducing  area.  So  we have  been  looking at  the  linkage between  thatportion of  the  ECI  attributable to  people who produce  services  and thecost  of  services.  There  the  linkage  is  quite  clear.  That  is,  if  welook back  over almost  any period of  time we  see  that  as  costs  go  up  inthat  area, prices  follow rather  quickly.  That  is  the  area  that wethink we  have  to  concentrate on most.  But  even  in  that  area,  therelated portion of  the  ECI has  not  been moving up.  Therefore,  thatparticular alarm bell,  which we  think  is  the  first  one  that reallyindicates  approaching problems,  is  not yet  ringing.  We have  not beenable  to  find  any convincing reason  to  think  that productivityimprovements  have  been absorbing  increases  in  labor costs.  We  are allaware,  of  course,  that  the productivity numbers  are  not  very good, butwe do  not  think that  that  is  an  area where  we can  place a lot  ofconfidence,  at  least  not  yet.The other area  that  we  in New York and most  of  us  around thetable  have  been talking  about  relates  to  whether  the  share  ofcorporate profits  in  national  income has  been producing  something  of  abuffer. One would  think  that  is  true  for  the  first  two  quarters  of11/13/96-18-this year.  As  the  data keep  coming  in  on the  third quarter  and westart  getting into  the  fourth quarter, we  are rather  inclined tobelieve  that  that  may be behind us.  Corporate profitability  is  infact beginning to  turn down  a bit  and,  therefore,  the  notion thatincreases  in compensation will  be  absorbed by  lowering theprofitability level  is  probably not  a very good bet  to make.Our  conclusion  from all  of  this  is  that we understand betterwhy there  has been better  price performance than  a lot  of peoplethought  there would be  but  that  the  labor market  still  is  tight.  Thatportion  of  it  in  the service  area  seems  to  be  tight.  Therefore,  thereis  still  reason  to  be  cautious.  Thank you.

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  In  the relatively  long  intervalsince  our  last meeting, gave us  two  reports  froman  area we had not heard much about.  He  said  ithad gotten itself  in  a bit  of  aappeared that  the jam,  but  they were  going to  try to preserve as many jobs  as  theycould.  [Laughter]  Listening  to  directors  on  a recent conference  callreminded me of  how important  it  is  to  listen very carefully.  One  ofthem very forcefully stated  that  he had  seen very strong  evidence ofweakening demand for  steel.  He  indicated that  domestic  demand wasflat,  and he thought  it  would actually be  down  in 1997  compared with1996.  Imports would continue  to  be  a problem, and the  new capacity hehas been  telling us  about  for  the  last  couple  of  years was  alreadycoming  into production and  capacity would increase  further  in  1997.He  said the  new mills were  the price  leaders.  The productivity ofthese new mills was  so  much greater  than  that  of  the preexistingcapacity that he  saw substantial  downward pressure  on prices  and somevery difficult  times  ahead for  the  older  mills.Another  report  from that  Ifound very  interesting  in  terms  of  new developments came  from  acompany  in  Columbus,  Ohio, It  is  like  a Mrs.Fields but very diversified.  The  official  from  that  firm  said thatthe  fastest growing  segments  of  her  business are  catalog orders,  asshe  calls  them,  that come  in  over  800  numbers  and increasingly  thisyear over  the  Internet.and  I asked her what would happen  if  she  came  into  the  officeon  a Friday morning  and  found a message  from  Osaka ordering pastriesfor  a Monday morning meeting.  She  said  that  her  firm gets  such ordersall  the  time because  there  are  so  many Japanese associated with Hondaand other  firms  in Ohio.  They  learn  about  the  gift  box  that her  firmsells  and  their  orders  then  start  to  come  in  over  the  Internet.  WhenI asked about  the  cost,  she  said  that  for  a group  of  15  people herfirm would arrange  for  delivery on  that  Friday afternoon.  The packagewould arrive  in  Osaka on  Sunday,  and  it  would be  delivered on  Mondayfor  about  $100,  including  transportation.  She  said that was  less  thanthey would pay to  buy the pastries  locally.  I asked if  she  everthought  of  herself  as  being  in  the  export business.  She  said, No,  andshe  didn't  care.  What difference did it  make?  She may be right  aboutthat,  too.We also  met  in  recent weeks  with a lot  of  bankers  in westernPennsylvania, West Virginia,  and all  over Ohio.  Especially with  thecommunity bankers,  the  consistent  story  in meeting  after meeting was11/13/96-19-about  the  quality of  consumer credit.  One banker would get  started onthat subject  and  then everybody would tell  stories not  only aboutrising delinquencies and  increasingly slow payments, but  thephenomenon that  most worried them was  that of  people who had neverbeen  late in  making their payments unexpectedly walking into  the bankand declaring  themselves bankrupt.  Basically,  these were storiesabout  the pyramiding  of  credit  card debts  through transfers  of  debtbalances  from old cards  to  new cards  until  the borrowers ran  out  thestring  and their  incomes  simply could no  longer service  the  debts.So,  they declared bankruptcy.  The bankers  said that  the charge-offscould be  very high  for  this quarter, but  there  was a difference  ofopinion about  the  future.  Some  said that  they  thought  they hadtightened up  enough that  this  would be the  worst quarter;  othersbelieved that  1997  was going  to  be much worse.  We met with the  seniorcredit  officers  of  about a dozen  of  the  larger banks,  and they  allsaid that charge-offs would be  much greater  in  1997.  They are veryconcerned about  the credit  quality of  their  loans  on  the consumerside,  though  increasingly they  seem to  be  concerned about  thecommercial  side,  too.  They all  believed that  their  own exposure  tocommercial  real estate  in  the  form of  shopping  center  stores--theycall  them boxes--and hotels  that  they have  financed is  going  to  be  aproblem  in  1997.I asked them about  their  earnings projections.  They were  allbudgeting  for double-digit  loan volume growth  in  1997.  I asked themto  square  that with  the nominal  GDP growth of  about  4 to  4-1/2percent,  and of  course they  said  they were  going  to  take  it  from  theircompetition.  [Laughter]  They  all confessed  concern about  marginsnext year and said  that  they simply would not be  able  to  sustain  theircurrent earnings  levels  without  the  loan volume  they had built  intotheir budgets.  So,  1997  is  going  to  be  an  interesting year  in  termsof bank earnings.On  the national  economy, the  Board staff has revised down  itsthird-quarter GDP numbers  from  those shown  in the  Greenbook.  Based onthe  latest  GDP numbers  and until  we get  new data,  I assume  that meansthe  productivity growth number was close  to  zero in  the  third quarter,which defies  belief.  We  can talk all  we want about  whether  theproductivity number is  bigger  or smaller,  but it  is  wrong.  It  issimply inconceivable  that  there was no  productivity growth at  all  inthe  third quarter.  In  fact,  the  productivity numbers  for  this wholeyear are  just  not believable.What  I am  encouraged about  is  the Board's  staff projection  ofthe nominal GDP  trend.  I was  very concerned  in March of  this  yearwhen the  staff  first  made a substantial upward  revision  in  itsprojection of  nominal  GDP  for  this  year  and out  into  1997.  I was  evenmore concerned in  August when  that projection was notched  up  further,but  since  then the upward  adjustment has  all  been taken  away.  Thestaff  now has  its  lowest nominal  income growth projections  through1997  since  around 1995,  including a growth rate  of  around 4 percent  ora little more  as  we  finish the  year,  about the  same  as  it  appears  tohave grown  in  the  third quarter.  I do not  know precisely what  thegrowth  of  nominal  GDP was  for  the  third quarter;  it was  probably below4 percent.  The  staff  has  raised  its  growth projection  for  the  firstquarter  of  1997,  but  that  is  strictly on  the  basis of  an assumedrebound in  auto  sales.  If we  take  that  rebound  out  of  the projection,nominal GDP  growth is  still  flat  at  about  4 percent.  So,  out  through11/13/96-20-1998  the  expansion  of  nominal  GDP in  this projection is  still  runningat  a rate of  around  4 or  4-1/4  percent.  These numbers  are  well belowthe central  tendency of  the nominal GDP  forecasts  that  the Committeemembers provided in July for  the year  1997,  and they are below our  ownforecast  in Cleveland, which was  at  the  lower end of  that  centraltendency.The  question, then,  is  how can we get  an acceleration ofinflation?  It has  to  result from an acceleration  in  final  demand, andwe are no  longer seeing  that.  In  fact,  each successive revision  ofthe nominal  spending forecast  has been  in a downward direction.Conceivably, if  one were  to  believe  such a forecast,  higher inflationcould result with  such nominal  GDP growth  if  real  output were  to  dropfurther  to  little  or no growth.  As a practical matter,  I do  not  seehow the  Board staff  could be wrong on  the low  side  of  its  nominalspending forecast unless  I am given different  assumptions  than  I haveseen so  far  about money growth, which has  continued to  come in belowthe  earlier assumptions,  or  I am told  it  has  something  to do  withvelocity.  But  such  a velocity story would not  be consistent with theinterest rates we are  seeing.  In  fact,  the  story goes  in  the oppositedirection.  The way I use MZM, as  I have  tried to  describe before,  isas  a contemporaneous monitoring device  of what  is  happening to  nominalspending with a consistent  set  of  assumptions  about  interest  rates  andmoney growth.  That  tells me we are more  likely to  see weaker  ratherthan  stronger final  demand in  the  period ahead.  I think that  therisks  are  growing on  the down  side,  not  on  the up  side.  That view wasreinforced by these  stories  that  bankers  tell about  their  consumercredit portfolios.I have  one  last comment  on  labor-intensive  services that  BillMcDonough was  just  talking  about.  I think there  is  a very interestingissue  in  the  linkage here that  deserves  some  further research.  If  onethinks  about  a self-employed person  in business  services,  the  price ofthe  service  is,  of  course,  going to be  equal  to  the person'scompensation because output  in  this  case  is  defined  as  the  labor inputof  one person.  That  cannot change.  There  is  no  productivity in  thecalculation.  So,  any increase  in compensation would be all  inflationsimply by definition.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  The data  available since  the  last meetingconfirmed that the  economy has  slowed to  trend growth.  They suggestedthat  an  unfavorable mix between  final  sales  and inventory  investmentin  the  last  quarter weighs  heavily against  a rebound to  above-trendgrowth  in  the period immediately ahead.  The  data also  indicated thatthe  acceleration of  wage and  compensation costs  that  is  under way  issomewhat more modest  than previously anticipated.  And despite  thestabilization  of  the unemployment  rate  at  a level  that  may yet proveto  be below NAIRU,  inflation  remains  remarkedly well  contained.  Onbalance  the  data,  if  not  precisely consistent with  every aspect ofthat  forecast,  at  least matched our  fondest hopes  and rewarded ourpatience.The prevailing  economic  environment, however,  is  not withoutrisk going forward.  The main challenge  in  my view lies  in  thesuspicion  of  many of us,  precisely as  set  out  in  the  staff  forecast,that  trend  growth at  the  prevailing unemployment rate  will ultimately11/13/96-21-prove to  be  inconsistent with  stable  inflation going forward.Nevertheless,  in  the  near  term  there may be more downside  than upsiderisk with  respect  to  GDP growth, particularly given  the absence  so  farof  any clear  evidence  that  the  collapse  of  final  sales  in  the  thirdquarter has  been reversed and given  the  restraint  to production in  theperiod immediately ahead from  the projected slowing  in inventoryinvestment.Over  the more  important  intermediate-term horizon  of  thestaff  forecast, on  the  other hand, favorable underlying fundamentalsdo  I think support  expectations  of  growth near  trend.  Such growthmight  be  incompatible  with stable  inflation, given  the  current lowunemployment  rate.  Still,  this  outcome is  far  from preordained.Given the  current  federal  funds  rate setting,  growth could easily bebelow trend,  especially  in  the  near  term but even  over  the  forecasthorizon.  The unemployment  rate  could gradually  increase  to  NAIRUbefore  the building wage pressures  are passed  through  to  higherinflation.  If  this  sounds  too  good to be  true,  one  should note thatthis  is  essentially the  Blue  Chip consensus  forecast.  The Blue Chippanel projects  2 percent GDP  growth over  1997,  measured on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter  basis.  While  this  is  just below the  2.2percent rate  of  the  Greenbook  forecast,  it  is  enough to  produce amodest but  sustained increase  in the  unemployment rate.  The latterreaches  5-1/2 percent  by the  end of  1997,  a level  almost  identical  tothe  downward revised estimate of  NAIRU in  the  staff  forecast.  As  aresult,  inflation stabilizes  at  2-1/2  percent  for  the  GDP deflator  and3 percent  for the  CPI.  Even  if  the  staff  forecast proves  to becorrect,  a more  likely prospect  in my own mind, the projectedacceleration in  labor  costs  over  the  forecast horizon  is modest,thereby containing  the  threat  to  our  long-term price stabilityobjective over  the  time period  required for  a tightening of  policy  toreverse  the  rise  in  inflation.For  the moment,  a continuation  of  remarkably subdued priceinflation  gives us  the  luxury of  waiting  for the  data  to  clarifywhether  growth will  remain at  or  above trend and whether theunemployment rate will  begin to  rise while we  continue  to  monitor wagepressures  and benefit  costs.  We should not,  however, be  lulled  intobelieving on  the basis of  the  most  recent data  on wages  andcompensation  that  the  acceleration in  wages  that we have beenmonitoring and worrying about at  recent meetings  has  abated.  Inparticular,  I find the  third-quarter employment  cost report  literallytoo good to  be  true.  Rather than  taking at  face  value  thequarter  to  a 2-1/2 percent  rate  in  the  third quarter,  I believe  it  isprudent  to  focus  on  the  gradual but unmistakable uptrend in  the  four-quarter growth rate  to  3.3  percent  in  the  third quarter  from 2.8percent  a year  ago.  Part  of  the  explanation for  this  surprisingpattern  of  deceleration  in  the  quarterly wage data  may be  thevolatility of  quarterly wage changes  for  sales  workers  associated withtheir  commissions.  Leaving  out  sales  workers,  the  uptrend  in  annualwage  increases  is  both more  consistent and  steeper;  it  rises  from 2.7percent  a year ago  to  3.4  percent  in  the year ended  in  September.  Forthe  moment,  the  slower  acceleration in benefit  costs  has  damped theeffect  on  labor costs  of  the  rebound  in wage  changes.  In  addition,the  effect  of  higher  compensation costs  on prices may be  damped for  atime by declines  in  markups,  especially in  light  of  the widespreadexpression by  firms  of  the  lack  of  pricing  leverage.  Nevertheless,  if11/13/96-22-benefit costs  accelerate  toward  the rate of  increase in wages, we willmove very quickly  toward the  staff  forecast  of  an increase incompensation per hour near  3-1/2  percent.  At  some point,  firms willexhaust  their willingness  to  accept  compression  in  their markups.  Wegrowth and the recent pattern  of price  inflation, we  still have  timeto make sure.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  Once  again we  find ourselves  in  a very goodsituation and one  that  is  remarkably uniform, as  the  stories  aroundthe  table suggest.  Tight  labor markets, which have a potential  formaking a considerable contribution  to  the  long-run efficiency of  thiseconomy, provide an  opportunity for  people of modest  skills  toincrease  those skills  and move  up to  jobs  that  provide moderateincreases  in income.  If  the  shortages  of people with computer skillsresult  in more  people obtaining  computer skills, we will be  a lotbetter  off  going  forward.  If  Bob McTeer's young  interviewer  learns  topronounce  "conservative,"  she may well  get  a better  job,  and all  ofthis  is  to  the  good.At the  same  time, we  have  the  slowing in  the expansion  thatwe predicted and little evidence of  rising  inflation.  The economy  isgenerating  the  kind of mixed signals  that we  really like  to have,although they make  us  a little uncomfortable  as  forecasters because  itis  more difficult  to  tell what will  happen next.  I could build acase, and I think we all  could,  for the  expectation that  the economywill  rebound more rapidly than  we would like  it  to  and that  themystifyingly proper behavior of  inflation, as  several members  havesuggested, may be  only temporary.  The  consumer may come  roaring backduring  the  holidays  and beyond.  I could also build a case  forexcessive  slowing, and some  have  suggested  that.  The  consumer mayremain cautious  in the  face of  rising debt,  and  the  clearly over-valued  stock market might head down, perhaps  sharply.  Much depends  onpost-election political  developments.  If  we get  strong evidence,which we might get  fairly quickly, of  a bipartisan will  to  continuethe deficit  reduction process,  that  could reassure both consumers  andthe  financial  markets  and give us  lower  long-term rates  as  a solidbasis  for  the  continuation of  moderate growth.  That would be the  bestgift  that  the newly  elected candidates  in both  the White House  and theCongress  could deliver.  But  it  will  not be  easy.  It  will  be a lotharder  to make  further progress on the  deficit  than  it  was  in the  lastseveral years.In  sum, the  Greenbook  forecast  looks  as  good  as  any to  me.The  risks,  as  several people have pointed out,  seem a lot  moresymmetrical now than  at  the  time  of  the  last meeting, but  I wouldexpect  to  be  back in a month looking at  very much  the  same  problem.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since  Thanksgiving isalmost upon us,  it  seems appropriate  to  count our blessings, which arenumerous.  Economic performance with respect  to  both job  creation andinflation has  been  excellent,  and developments during  the  intermeetingperiod have  enhanced the prospect that  these  favorable  trends willpersist.  In  the  first place,  it  now  seems probable  that  spending11/13/96-23-growth will  moderate quickly  enough to avoid placing additionalstrains  on the  labor market.  Second,  inflation remains wellcontained.  In  fact,  the data  on broad measures  of inflation  in  PartII  of  the Greenbook  suggest that  inflation performance  has been betterthan merely well  contained  since, as  Bob Parry mentioned, every broadmeasure  of  inflation other  than the  total CPI  has  been  trendingdownward since  1993.With  respect to  inflationary pressures  in  the pipeline,  thethird-quarter ECI  report  failed  to  confirm our collective  fear  thatlabor market pressures would translate  into an acceleratingcompensation  trend.  I was quite pleased to  see  that with  the passageof  yet an  additional  quarter  in which  compensation ran at  such amoderate pace,  the  staff has  finally revised down  their  estimate ofNAIRU to  5.6  percent.  I consider this  a sensible  response  to  roughlytwo  years of  evidence  that  the  dynamics  of  inflation have  changed abit.  Additional good news  from an  inflation perspective  is  thatprices  of  commodities and  intermediate goods have  turned down sinceour  last meeting.  The  outlook for  food prices has  improved, and eventhe  outlook for  energy prices is  more  favorable.  In contrast  topressures  in  the  labor market, pressures  on  capacity do  not  seemintense at  this point,  and  investment  in plant  and equipment  is  stillrapid enough  in  the  staff  forecast  to mitigate capacity pressures  evenfurther over  the  forecast period.Finally, there  are  hints that  firms  may be  stepping up theless visible  investments  that they make  in  their workers  to  createthrough training  the  skills  they  require in  their workforce but  findin  short  supply in the  labor market.  I would agree with GovernorRivlin's  comments  in  this  regard.  In particular,  I was  struck by arecent Business  Week article  that  detailed myriad ways  in  which thewith unskilled, disadvantaged workers  to  inculcate  good work habitsand  in particular to  teach  English as  a second language to  improvebasic  literacy and create  opportunities  for  eventual promotions  intomore  responsible positions.  These  investments  are on  the  flip side  ofthe  hysteresis process  that  is  believed by many  observers  to  haveraised NAIRUs  in  European countries;  that  occurred as  young peopleunable  to  find jobs  experienced deterioration  in  their  skills and lostattachment  to  the world of  work.  So,  I would agree with  the  view thatthere  are  benefits as  well  as  costs  to  tight  labor markets.In  spite  of  all  that  is  going right  in  the American economy,I too  remain concerned about  the  outlook.  My  first  worry relates  tothe  Greenbook's  assessment.  I agree  with  the  staff  that we may wellbe  living on borrowed time  and  that  inflation will  eventuallyaccelerate  if  the unemployment rate  remains at  its  current  level,  asin  the Greenbook  forecast.  Although I believe  there  is  strongevidence  that  NAIRU has  declined below 6 percent,  it  seems  difficultto  use  the  data  in  hand at  this point  to  defend the proposition  thatit  is  as  low as  5.2  percent.My  second worry relates  to  the  behavior of  aggregate  demand.Here  I have  no  quarrel with  the  staff's  estimate  of  moderation  ingrowth  to  a shade  above  trend  in  1997  and  1998,  but  I am concernedabout  the  risks.  With drags  on growth  stemming  from governmentspending, residential  spending, and  trade,  and with reduced  impetus  togrowth  from  investment spending,  the  behavior of  consumption, as  Mike11/13/96-24-Prell  emphasized,  is  critical  to  the outlook.  The Greenbook assumesthat  consumption will quickly rebound  and then  grow in  line  withdisposable  income.  As Mike  noted, consumers have greater  income  andwealth and their  confidence  is high,  so  it  is  perfectly reasonable toassume  that  the  third-quarter spending  lull was  temporary and astatistical  aberration.  Indeed,  I think one could easily justify amuch stronger  consumption forecast  than in  the  Greenbook, given  theenormous gains  in stock market wealth  and the  huge  increase inhousehold net worth that we  have seen  in  spite  of  the buildup  inconsumer debt.  On  the  other hand,  I am equally concerned about  thedownside risk  to  consumption because  at  this  stage  a rebound  inconsumption  spending is  a forecast  and not yet  a fact.  During  thethird quarter, it  seems  that  three  things occurred simultaneously:consumer spending stalled, the  growth  of consumer credit plummeted,and lending standards  tightened.  I do  not  know just  what caused what,but  with household debt  burdens--if  one  includes  leasing payments  asGovernor Lindsey  likes  to do--approaching  all  time highs  and withbankruptcies  surging  and consumer  credit charge-offs  running wellabove  expectations,  it  is  not  very surprising  that  lenders wouldtighten  standards.  It  seems  perfectly possible  to me  that  theconsequence  could be  weaker  spending by liquidity-constrainedhouseholds  than  the  Greenbook assumes.  I also  would agree that  asignificant  stock market  correction, which cannot be  ruled out,  addsdownside risk.Well, where does  that  leave me?  It  leaves me  thinking thatit  is  certainly within  the  realm of possibilities  that  growth may slowenough over  the  forecast period to  bring the  economy back  towardNAIRU under the  Greenbook assumption concerning monetary policy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor Lindsey.

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think  thisCommittee  is  going to be  facing  some  difficult  issues  in  the yearsahead.  As  if  we  don't have  enough to  worry about,  I want  to  throw oneother  issue  on  the  table  and explain why I think it  is  more  importantthan what  we  have been  talking about.  Mr. Chairman, you were  the  onewho put me  in  this pickle.  You  had to  go  to  another meeting, and so  Ihad to  talk  to  a group  after you walked around  the  table,  shook alltheir hands,  went  out  the  door,  and there  I was!  [Laughter]Interestingly, it  was  a group  of Dutch visitors,  but  there also wereJapanese  in the  audience.  One of  them  said that  15  years  ago when hewas  stationed  in New York  the Dow was  at  1,000  and now it  is  at  6,000.He  asked me how I explained  that.  Well,  that  is  a sure  way to  getoneself  in  trouble,  so  I did some  quick, fancy math and explained how6,000  was  a perfectly reasonable number.  Throw  in nominal  GDP growthand profit  share growth and, voila, we were pretty much  there.  Infact,  I got  the Dow up  to  6,600  [laughter],  and then  I stopped andjust breathed a sigh of  relief.  I had  other  things  in  the  backgroundin  case  I did not make  it!But  here  is  the problem.  Let's  take  a shorter period, 1992to  1996.  The  S&P index has  gone up  about  69  percent and corporateprofits  have  gone  up  63  percent.  That  sounds pretty  reasonable.  Thecatch here,  of  course,  is  that  if  the markets  are at  all  forward-looking,  they are presumably buying  the  next  five years' profits, notthe  last  five years'  profits.  It  is  not  clear  all mutual  fund buyersknow that,  but  that  is what  they  should be  looking at.  At  the11/13/96-25-beginning  of  an  expansion when you  are about to  face  five years  of  13percent growth in profits, you can put  a higher  evaluation on  stockprices.  Implicitly,  therefore, the  fact  that  stock prices  have  risenas  fast  as  profits  implies an  expectation of  another  five years  of  13percent growth in  profits.  But  that would be  inconsistent with  thenumbers  in the Greenbook,  and that  gets  to  the  root  of  our problem.  Ithink  that because  of  our success people have  now pushed the perceivedrisk of  a recession  so  low that  they  are putting valuations  onfinancial  assets  and--God forbid,  they are  erecting buildings  inBoston again--on  real assets  that pose a problem for  the  future.  Ithink Governor Meyer was  exactly on  target  in quoting the  Blue  Chip asan  indicator  of where people  think we  are heading.  The  consensus  nowis  that  inflation is  permanently under control  and that  we will  havecontinued moderate growth, probably permanently, though with some downquarters and  some up quarters.  As  a result  of  our great success  here,we have  low and stable  interest  rates.  I would suggest  that ourrecent well-intentioned  silence may actually be  leading to even moreof  a sense  of  security, which may be good in  the  short  run but  isprobably not good in  the  long  run.  In addition, we have world peace.The only remaining  risk in the  forecast  is  political  risk, and thegovernment.So what  is  there  to  worry about?  Well,  I have a little  listand I am going  to  go  over  it  in reverse order.  One  is  the  oil  sectorwhich I think  is  probably riskier than  is perceived in  the Greenbook,particularly when one  looks  at  the situation  in  the House  of  Saud andplaces  like that.  That  is  a low probability risk.  Then we come  tothe  consumer debt  slowdown.  Here  I think we really have  a two-  tothree-quarter story at most,  unless  either we or  the  banks mess  it up,and I do not promise  that.  Back when I first  commented on consumerdebt at  the  beginning  of  1995,  I was  looking at  1994  numbers.  Iestimated that  to  get  out  of  the  consumer debt hole,  the  personalsaving rate  had to  rise by about  1-1/2  points  from what  it was  then,about 3.8  percent  in  1994.  We  are  up  to almost  5 percent now;  alittle more  and we will  be there.  There  is  nothing  really to worryabout.  A couple more quarters  of  drag on  consumption growth and wewill  be  fine.  But  I think there  is  the possibility  that  we asregulators and  the banks will  make things worse, particularly  if  JerryJordan's story  is  true  about what  to  expect  in 1997.  I have  learnedin  this  job  that  bankers  are very predictable and  regulators are  verypredictable  as  a result.  We  have  to  be very, very careful  in makingsure  that we  do not  have a consumer  recession  that we  create byregulatory decree.  But basically  I do  not  think  there  is  that  much ofa risk  if we  leave well  enough alone.There  is  also  a political  risk.  At  our  last  FOMC meeting, Isaid  that  if  we  got  a narrow election  result, which is  what  thecourage.  The new Congressional  leadership has  signaled  that  they aregoing to  sit back and wait  six  months  for  the  President  to  come upwith a budget.  The President has  signaled that he  is  going to  supporta balanced budget  amendment, which he  is  going to  be  stuck withanyway.  So,  we have  nobody  taking action except  to  push throughsomething that  will  save us  from ourselves.  That  sounds  a lot  likewhat  I hear  in  Europe, which is  that  Brussels  is  going to  save  thepoliticians  from  themselves  in  each of  the  countries.  I think that,when the markets  recognize  that  we  are trying  to  postpone severe11/13/96-26-fiscal problems by finding commissions  or  balanced budget  amendmentsto  deal with  them, there  is  a potential  risk  for  the  bond market  andfor  the economy in  the  years ahead.The  biggest risk relates  to  the  current  stock marketvaluation based on 13  percent  growth  in profits.  It  comes back  tosimple math.  Nominal GDP growth  in  the  last  four quarters has  been4.2  percent.  As Jerry Jordan pointed out,  if we  look  at  the moneygrowth numbers,  there  is  absolutely no reason  to  expect  such GDPgrowth  to  accelerate.  I admit  that we do not  know a lot  about moneygrowth, but  everything we do  know suggests  that  nominal  GDP growth  isnot  going to  accelerate.  How we are  going to get  13  percent  growth  incorporate profits, or  11  percent growth  or  anything like  that,  tovalidate these  levels  of  the stock market  I am not  sure.  If we  have  aproblem there,  either  the market  will  stop  rising or we will  have  tointo  the process.  And, frankly,  I think that  call  is  going  to be ourtoughest  decision in  the  years ahead.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor  Phillips.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  economycurrently seems  to be  in a fairly wide holding pattern.  Theanticipated second-half  slowdown is  under way, although we do  not  knowits  extent.  As  always when we  are trying  to  look forward, it  is  hardto know whether we  are  going to  circle  for  a while  longer,  come in  foranother soft  landing,  crash land, or  resume  higher altitudes.  Atleast  for  the  near term, it  seems  to me  that  the  holding pattern  isthe  most likely scenario.  The  slowdown  in  the  third quarter nowappears  to  have been more pronounced than was  earlier  thought,  giventhe  recent  inventory numbers.  But  low inventory levels  should makethe  fourth quarter of  1996  and  early 1997  look a bit  stronger, leavingthe  outlook  on balance  for  the  second half  of  this  year at  theproverbial  sustainable  level.  Although we  are beginning to  hear somearguments  about weaker demand, I think  the  arguments  that  the  economycontinued weakness in  consumer demand  and housing, and  associatedslowing  in  the manufacturing or  industrial  sector.  It  seems  to methat most  of  the  recent  economic  indicators  are pointing to  a bit morestrength,  or  at  least to  a soft  landing,  and there may be  some  tailwinds  for higher  altitudes.With  respect  to  the  spending situation,  there will be  somepropensity  for  consumers  to  spend as  long as we  continue to  have  astrong  labor market  and people  are making money.  That view issupported by  some  of  the  recent consumer  confidence numbers  that  mayin  turn be  fueled by the wealth effects  of  the  strong  stock market.The retail  surveys are pointing  to  a reasonably strong holiday  season.It  is  even  feasible  that we  could  see  some  tail  wind action  from lowerinterest  rates;  the  housing market  feasibly could get  a modest boost.Business  fixed investment,  including nonresidential  construction, hasbeen  holding up  better  than most  forecasts.  Financing  is  generallyavailable.  At  least  for  now, we  are  seeing  continued internalfinancing  available  as  business  profits  have held up.  Maybe,  asGovernor Lindsey says,  that will  not  continue.  Even  so,  if  profitsstart  to  get  pressured, the  cost  of  external  capital  is  low as  aresult  of  low  interest  rates and  the  rise  in  stock prices.  Banks arecontinuing  to  provide  financing.  Foreign  investment  is  another source11/13/96-27-of  strength.  There  is  evidence  that  businesses  are  issuing new debtand equity and utilizing  increased bank  financing.  Maybe they  areputting  all  of  it  under  a mattress, but productive activity  is morelikely.On  the  inflation front,  we may also be  in a holding pattern.We  are  in  the middle of  a period of  gathering  the most  current data,and what we have,  I think,  is  relatively encouraging--the  core  PPIdata that  came  out  this  morning, lower commodity prices,  better-than-expected crops, and a fairly benign  third-quarter GDP deflator  andother PCE  deflators.  The recent  ECI  numbers were  surprisingly benign.There  are  some uncertainties  in  this  scenario.  Will  consumerdebt,  in  fact,  damp  spending  or will  some  of  the  labor  marketuncertainties  in  the  era of  downsizing damp consumer enthusiasm?  Ifthere  is  a stock market correction,  it  is  hard to  know how that  isgoing to  play out.  It  depends obviously on  how deep  a correction wehave.Fiscal policy has been a bit  on  the  back burner  at our  lastcouple  of meetings.  But with the  elections  over and Congress  comingback, we  are  starting  to  hear discussions of  another budget deal.Depending on  how it  is  structured or how contentious  the budgetnegotiations  get,  this  issue  may throw some uncertainty into  thefinancial markets or  cause some uncertainty among  consumers.Turning to  productivity, the numbers  do not provide muchsupport  for  increased  or continued progress  on inflation.  Givencurrent wage pressures  and  low unemployment, we  should either beseeing  lower profits  or price increases  or  improved productivity.  Weare  not  seeing any of  those.  So,  I continue  to be  skeptical  of  theproductivity numbers, but we really do not  know the  full  story.In  sum, I think that  the picture  that we painted at  theconfirmed.  And while  there  are  risks,  I think that  on balance  thebest guess going  forward is  continued growth.

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like  to  sayfirst of  all  that  comments  around the  table  at  these meetings  arealways  insightful  and very  interesting, but  I have found  that  to beparticularly true  this morning and  I greatly appreciate  it.  It  alsowould appear  that  the discussion  is moving  along rather  smartly today;we  may get  coffee at  a more  reasonable hour  than we sometimes  do!  Bymy calculation,  I am  the  clean-up hitter  and  I have very  little  to  addto  what  has  been  said.Let  me  just  summarize very briefly.  I share  the  stronggeneral  concern around the  table  that  the  tight  labor markets  and theattendant  rise  in wages  could very well  lead  to  price  increases.  Thatstill  could very well  happen, but  we see  very little evidence  of  sucha development  so  far,  and we will  just have  to watch  that veryclosely.  The  one big  thing  that  is  new this  time,  as  we  had hoped andexpected,  is  that we  now have  confirmation  that  the  expansion hasslowed.  Looking ahead, our  attention obviously  must shift  to  whetherthe  expansion  is  in  line  for a reacceleration with  the  dangers  that11/13/96-28-would be attendant  to  that, whether  it  will  rock along near trend,plus  or minus  a bit,  or  whether  indeed the  economy may be  in the  earlystages of  a somewhat  more serious  slowdown.  The  point has been made,and I share  it,  that  as  time  goes  on  and events unfold, the risks  arebecoming more  symmetric.  We cannot  tell  yet, and I am not prepared toadopt  a symmetric point  of view at  this  juncture, but  it  may be thatwe  will be  thinking quite  soon  of returning  to  a symmetric  directive.For  now, it  would certainly appear  that  the  remarkable economicperformance  that we have  seen  for  some  time  is  continuing.  We  shouldwatch  it  closely and continue to  let  it  run.  Thank you.

MR. D. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very much.  Any questions  forDavid?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I had a question all  ready, David, about  tryingto  square the  Bluebook with  the Greenbook, but your  last remarks  aboutthe aggregates go  in  the  same direction.  That's because you antici-pate M2  growth of  4 percent  for  the year,  and that means  there willhave been  essentially no  increase  or  a very small  increase  in M2velocity this  year.  As  I noted  earlier, the Greenbook has  a nominalGDP growth  forecast  of  4-1/4  percent  or  so.  I track nominal  GDP on afour-quarter moving-average and an  eight-quarter moving-average basis,and that,  of  course, produces a growth pattern  that  has been trendingdown  over  the  last  several years.  Now, if  I run  that  trend outthrough  the  end of  1998  using the  Greenbook's  forecast  of  essentially4 to  4-1/4 percent nominal  GDP growth, such  growth must acceleratebeyond the  Greenbook horizon  to  validate  the  staff  statements  aboutinflation and  a policy stance  involving  a 5-1/4 percent  funds  rate.The  staff  forecast  is  getting  close  to  the point where the  CPI  isgrowing at  the  same rate as  nominal  GDP.  That  does  not  compute.  Thatmeans we have to  have nominal  GDP  growth  accelerating beyond  theforecast  horizon, and  I do not  see the  mechanism by which a sustained5-1/4  percent  funds  rate  produces  the needed  increase  in  the  growth  ofaggregate  demand.

[SECTION]

MR. D. LINDSEY.  I will  turn  to  Mike  Prell  for  answers  tosome  of  your  questions about  the  forecast.  As  I look at  the  nominalGDP numbers on  a four-quarter basis  starting this year,  I don't  seemuch change in  the  annual  growth  rates, which go  from  4.7  percent thisyear  to  4.5 percent  in  1997  and 4.4  percent  in 1998--actually a littlethe  broader measures of  prices  is  something  I should probably pass  onto  my R&S  colleagues.11/13/96-29-

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you.  [Laughter]  Let me  just  say onceagain  that  our  forecast  is  not based on  the  monetary aggregates.Rather, we  derive what we would expect  in terms  of monetary aggregategrowth  through our assessment  of  likely patterns  of  money demandconsistent with the  interest rates  and  economic activity we  areforecasting.  That  is  a different  framework  than  I think you  aresuggesting  for  thinking about  the  outlook  for nominal GDP.  As  we lookahead, we see  an  economy that  is  operating  above potential  and agradual  acceleration of  inflation.  In  such an  economy,  the growth ofreal  output  tends  to  erode  gradually over  time.  We  anticipate  somegradual  deceleration in  real output growth  from  1996  to  1997  and  1998.I think there  is  a coherence to  this,  and nominal GDP  is  just  asummation of  these  forces  as  we see  the picture.  I do not have aparticular view about  1999,  but  certainly we  are  coming out  of  1998  inno better position with  respect to  the  alleviation  of  inflationarypressures  in  the  labor markets.  So,  we would anticipate  at  this  pointan  extrapolation  of  that gradual acceleration  of  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions  for David?  Ifnot,  let me get  started.  As  far as  I can see,  the  outlook  is verylittle changed  from what  it was  at  the  time of  the  last  meeting.  Theoutlook may have  shifted  toward slightly  slower growth, but  only atthe margin and within  the  expected range of  statistical  error.The data  are  difficult  to  read, but  labor  marketsunquestionably are still  quite  tight.  My suspicion  is  that  ourmeasures  of  labor costs  may be biased downward in  the  third quarter.This  is my  impression  for  reasons other than  those  that  have beenraised around the  table.First,  I don't  think we  have  enough data  to  verify  thishypothesis  on a national  level,  but  it  clearly shows up  at  a microlevel  in  the  sense  that,  when we  have  a very tight  labor market,  someof  the wage  increases  take  the  form of  promotions.  Consequently, weget  a grade updrift  that  does  not  show up  fully in  the wage structure,which is  essentially what  the  ECI  represents.  Compensation data  dosuggest that  some of  the  grade  drift may be  in  addition  to  the  realdrift  toward  truly higher skilled workers.There  is  also  a question about  the  average hourly earningsfor  October, which as  we  know came  in  at  zero.  But  I think  the  staffhas also demonstrated quite credibly  that  the  industry-by-industrycorrelation between average  hourly earnings  and average hours  issignificant.  This  implies  that  there  is  an  overtime  component  inthese  data.  There was  a significant decline  in  average weekly hoursin  October, and  adjusting  for that  would raise  the October  averagehourly earnings number by something  like  .2 percent.  That  is  not  abig  change, but  I think the  data  are giving us  a more benign  look atthe  wage structure  than probably exists.There also  is  the  issue  on  the  other  side  as  to  whether  theacceleration  in  entry-level jobs  suggested by  anecdotal  reports  isbeing offset  by an  increase in  the  number  of  people leaving  the  laborforce,  largely  through retirement.  I am not  sure whether  the  wagerates  of  retirees are  rising, but  because  the wage rates  of  theseolder workers are  higher  than average,  the  ratio does  not  have  torise.  The  rate of  retirements  just  has  to  be  high enough  to  overcomethe  general aging of  the  remainder of  the  workforce  to  allow us11/13/96-30-readily  to  reconcile  higher entry-level  wages  with a still  sluggishstructure  of wages  overall.Another  issue is  the  variable pay question  that  was  raisedearlier by Gary  Stern.  The  surveys  are beginning  to  show that  for aproportion of  the workforce, which is  still  relatively small,  wagesare  significantly related to profitability or  other  company results.This means  that  the  issue  applies  to  a much broader group  than  salesworkers.  It  is  an  important  issue because  to  the  extent  that we  havebig wage  increases  as  a consequence of,  or  tied to,  profitability,such increases  are not necessarily inflationary.  That  is  true becauseas  costs go  up  in  relation to  prices,  profit margins  are  squeezed andthose wages  automatically start  to  adjust  down.  So,  while  it  may betrue  that  the  wages  of  commission sales workers have been slippingrelative to the  average, which  is  the reason why the numbers  for  non-sales workers have  gone up  somewhat more,  that may be  partially offsetby the  higher wages  of  the  increasing proportion of  workers who  havetheir  salaries  tied more  closely to  profitability.What  I see  as  the  bottom line  of  all  this  is  that  the wagestructure  is  extraordinarily dynamic  and not  easy to  read.  The  onlything we  know for  sure--or more precisely for  which our  information  isfairly accurate--is  total  wages and salaries,  and probably averagehourly wages and salaries  as well  if  one is  prepared to  argue that  thedata on  hours worked are  not  all  that  bad.  But  any effort  to  isolatein  that  structure such things  as  misplaced merit  increases  or  comparatios  and that  kind of  thing,  all  of  which are  important  to  anunderstanding of  where the  wage  increases  are  stemming from,  is  reallydifficult.  Therefore,  I think we have  to be  quite  careful.  We  alsohave  to  be  careful  about our productivity data, not only  for  thereasons  that  I have been mentioning  in previous meetings  relative tothe bias  in price  indexes and  the  like,  but  also  because  there aresignificant  changes  in the  quality of  the  hours worked  that we do  notadjust  for.  Our  deficient understanding of  the  true  structure  ofcosts, benefits,  and the  like  should create a degree  of  humbleness  onour part  that we have not  yet  achieved.  [Laughter]  I merely  suggestthat we have  to  work harder.The  evidence  that  there  is  a significant  shortfall  inmeasured wages  from  the predictions  of  our wage-NAIRU  econometricrelationships  is  pretty clear.  It  is  also  clear from  the  reports  allof  you are getting that wage  increases,  no  matter how we measure  them,are  falling short  of  those  estimated  from our  equations.  They  arefalling  short  in  a way that  largely mirrors  the  rise  in  operatingprofit margins.  It  is  difficult  to  get  an  exact relationship, but  itis  rather  obvious  that we  can explain  a very significant  part  of  thiswage/price  inflation nexus  by a clear  downshift  in the  tradeoffbetween wage  gains and  job  security or  some  other  factor  for which  jobsecurity stands  as  a proxy.  This,  as  we have  discussed over  the  lasttwo  years,  is  clearly a transitory phenomenon.  Nonetheless,  theevidence suggests  that  the  third-quarter  operating profit  margins  areholding  up.  They may be revised down when we  have more  complete datafor  the  quarter, but  they  clearly will  not  be down by very much, andthey  surely will  not be  down by anywhere near what  is  implied byholding  the  statistical  discrepancy  of  the  GDP accounts constant.The  importance  of  all  of  this  is  that  if  we  are still  seeingevidence  that  the  broader  indexes  of  price  inflation  are easing,  the11/13/96-31-rate  of  inflation is  falling or at  worst  stabilizing, and profitsuggests  that whatever  is  happening  is not  happening very  fast.  And,as  I argued at  the  last meeting, irrespective of how badly we under-estimate what productivity may or may not be doing, it  is  still  thecase  that  if  wages begin to  accelerate  relative to  whatever the growthof productivity may be,  then we  will begin to  see wage/pricepressures, which we very  strongly wish  to  avoid.  Nonetheless,  I thinkwe have been very fortunate in  that  there  is  no  credible  evidence  thatsuch a process  is  in  train.If we reduce  the  size  of  the  add-factors  in our variousequations  that  relate wage  change to  unemployment  or any measure  oflabor  tightness, we will  get an  acceleration of  inflation;  that  iswhat  the  algebra requires.  But we do not  know that we have  turned  thecorner.  As  far as  I can see,  it  is not  self-evident  that we have  add-factors  that  have  stabilized and are  closing.  They are not.  If  wewanted  to  become real  deflationists,  we could argue that we arehalfway  through the  process  and we  have not  seen anything yet.  I donot believe  that myself,  but  it  is  not  outside the  purview of  ourevaluation.  The Greenbook requires  a certain  add-factor forecast  thatpresupposes  the current  transitional  phase is  in  the  process of  comingto  an end.  I think  the process  is  coming  to  an  end, but  I do  not wishto  bet  the  ranch that  that  is  in  fact  the  case.  So,  however  oneevaluates  this,  it  is  clear that  whatever is  occurring  is  notoccurring rapidly.When we  look at  the  inflationary pressures  that  are  currentlybuilt  into  the  economy as  a result of  the  tight  level  of  laborutilization, the question is  really one  of  whether  the  economy willease off  before a process  of  inflationary pressures  emerges or whetherthere has been  some  longer-term change  in  the  structure that,  as  somepeople  in  the  business community argue,  has  essentially killed theinflation expectations  bugaboo.  I think there  is  no  evidence of  sucha change.  There  is,  however, some  question  as  to  whether  in  fact  thisexpansion  can slow sufficiently to  take pressures  off  the  laborpressures moot.  It  is  much  too  early to  say that  that will  happen.My own  judgment  is  that  the  evidence  is  very mixed and highly unlikelyto  be in  that  direction in  the short  run.It  is  nonetheless  the  case  that  less  final  demand is  beinggenerated now by a net  increase  in  the  stock of  motor vehicles  or  thestock of  plant and  equipment.  That  is  the  saturation argument.  Oneshould remember  that  the  net increase  in property accounts plus  thenet  increase  in  the  stock of  consumer durables--that  is,  afterdepreciation--is  the private  capital  account  component  of  GDP.  We  cancompare it  with GDP  to  get  a judgment  as  to  the  extent  that  theelement of  saturation  is  adding to  or  subtracting  from GDP.  It  is  theissue  that  I raised when  I said  there were  two  types  of  inventories:the  stock of  capital  and business  inventories.  The  growth in  thestock of  capital  moderated in  the  third quarter,  as  best  we  can judge,putting downward pressure on GDP  and on  final  demand.I think  the  regular  inventory data  are  interesting,especially in  the  context of  their being historically low by anymeasure.  But  the  level  of  inventories  is  not  relevant  in  the  shortrun  for  the GDP  forecast.  It  is  the  rate  of change  that  is  relevant,11/13/96-32-and a change  clearly can  occur at  any level  irrespective of  where  theinventory-sales  ratios may be.  While  I think there  is  some  reasonableargument to  be made  that  a goodly part  of  the  inventory accumulationwe  are  seeing is  voluntary--in  the  sense  that  all  the  surveys  wemonitor do  not point  to particular problems--we do have  to  account  forthe  fact  that  the  underlying prices  of  commodities  and materials havetaken a big turn to  the south.  Steel  scrap prices  have  fallen  off aledge.  I think the reason in part  is  competition  from imports.  ItMoskow are both picking  up in into  the  first  quarter of  next year are coming  in below expectations.If  that  continues,  it  may reflect  some weakening in  the consumption ofdomestic  steel  or  it  may be  that  imports  are really becoming an issuethat  is  going to  be something for  the steel  industry to be  concernedabout.  In addition,  aluminum prices  are under  significant downwardpressure.  They  obviously are more  subject  to  international  pressuresthan steel  prices  in  the  United States,  certainly more  so  than steelscrap prices.  Copper  is weak.  All  the  industrial  prices are  gettingsoft.  These  are not  the  types of  numbers we usually see when  there  isa big voluntary inventory surge.  So,  the  inventory  issue  is  by nomeans  clear.order booksI think all of  you have argued quite  correctly that  theretail  market--and personal consumption  expenditures more broadly--isthe key to  the  outlook for  economic activity.  I did have  somebody onthe Board's  staff  look  at  the  historical relationships  and try  to  re-work the  consumer  credit data  to put  them back  into  gross extensionsminus repayments,  equalling the  change  in  consumer credit,  as we  infact  used to  do.  We have  some  unpublished information that probablygives  us  a leg up  on it.  It  shows,  as you might well  imagine, a verysharp decline  in gross  extensions.  When we  get,  as  hopefully we willshortly, the  ratios  of gross  extensions  to  retail  sales  for  certaingroups,  we will  have a better view as  to whether  there  is  anything tothe  argument  that particular groups  are being  liquidity  constrained.I am not  saying  this  information will  tell  us  a great  deal,  but  it  mayadd  something  to  our understanding  of  this  puzzling third quarter.  Wehave been  through  a lot  of  periods  in which consumer expenditures haveslowed and  then picked up  again.  Unless  the  business cycle is  dead,however,  there will be  a point  at which that pickup will  not  occur.The  question is  when, and perhaps  these  consumer credit numbers willtell us  something  in  this  regard.  I have been  concerned about  thelevel  of  consumer debt,  as  you know, since  the beginning of  the year.I have  taken  over  from Governor Lindsey, who  has  thrown me a lateral,and  I am running with  it  for  a while  anyway.  I gave  him the worryabout  the  stock market.  [Laughter]  This division of  labor  isprobably worthwhile.It  is  too  soon  to  tell what  is  happening  to  Christmas  sales,but  remember that  we do  not get much of  the  fourth-quarter personalconsumption  expenditures  from the  October data.  The real  action  is  inone-third, one-third.  They clearly are biased  significantly towardthe November data,  which we  do not  have.I think one of  the more  interesting unanswered questions  getsdown  to  the  housing industry.  As  Mike  Prell  pointed out,  it  isweakening but  there  are  two  fascinating  trends.  One  is  home  sales,which as  you know have gone  straight  up.  The  other  is  single-family11/13/96-33-permits  net of  cancellations, which are essentially single-familyhousing starts plus  the  change in  the permits backlog, and  that numberhas  gone  straight down.  It  is  at  its  lowest  level  in  more  than ayear.  If we  look at  a chart,  the  sales  figures  go up like  that  andthe net permits  figures go  down, with  the starts  in the  middle.  If wereconcile them  statistically, what we  find  is  that not  only does  thepermits backlog  drop very  sharply but  so  does  the  inventory  of  newhomes.  The  changes  in those  two  inventories essentially  account  forthe different  trends  in sales  and permits.  This  raises  an interestingissue.  Have  the homebuilders  decided  that  the  markets are weakening,which is  what  is  reflected in  their reports  to  the  NationalAssociation  of Homebuilders, and are  they  therefore  trying to  reducetheir  advance  commitments and inventories by pushing  the  excess  supplyout  into  the  market?  That would not be  inconsistent  with  therelatively soft prices of new home  sales.  Or  is  the  demand  for newhomes really much  stronger  than they have  committed to and consumersare  pulling out what  the builders  have been putting into  the pipelinemuch faster  than  they expected so  that  they will  be  forced veryshortly  to pick up  their permits activity and their  starts  activity?My guess  is  that  the  odds  are  still  in the  direction  of  the  firstscenario.  But unless  October home  sales  are  down, which I think isvery likely, we have a very  interesting dilemma  about what  is  going onin this market.  And since  this  is  such a big cyclical  component  inthe  current,  immediate context,  it  along with personal consumptionexpenditures will  be  a key player in determining where  this economy  isgoing.For  the moment,  I would say from  a policy point of view thatthese  developments  leave us  just about where we have  been recently.  Ithink  it would be premature  to  pull  back on  the  asymmetry.  As  long asthe  labor markets  remain as  tight  as  they  are,  inflation can turn upon a dime.  Were  we  to  go back  to  symmetry and then  suddenly have  totighten,  I think  that would put  us  in an awkward position.  So  I thinkwe ought  to  stay where we are,  at  least  through the  December meeting.I would recommend  "B" asymmetric.  Vice Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I favor  "B" asymmetric, Mr.Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  formulating policy under presentcircumstances  obviously requires  finding the  right balance betweenlikely future outcomes  in the  economy and  recent developments.  Laborside.  Even if  the natural rate  of unemployment has  decreased a bit,that  tightness would suggest  a moderate uptrend for  inflation  in  thefuture.  And as  I said earlier, we could see  a substantial  rise  ininflation  if  the  normal historical  relationship between unemploymentand inflation were to  reassert  itself.  These considerations  make  itlikely that we will need to  tighten policy in  the  future.  However,recent  inflationary developments  have been  surprisingly favorable,  andeconomic  growth slowed in  the  third quarter and may slow further  thisquarter.  These developments  suggest  that  it might  be prudent  to waita while to  see  how things  unfold before tightening policy.  Onbalance, therefore,  I would prefer to  leave  the  federal  funds  rateunchanged for  the  time being,  and  I support your recommendation  foralternative  "B" and asymmetric  language.11/13/96-34-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, it  is  obvious  from thediscussion around  the  table  today, the  latest economic  data, and  Ithink particularly the  behavior of bond rates  that  the  risk of  apronounced near-term increase  in  inflation pressures has  diminished.So,  I no  longer  think  that we need a 50  basis point  increase in  thefederal  funds rate.  But  I still  think  it  is  more  likely  than not  thatsomewhat greater restraint  is  going to  be needed at  some point  in  therelatively near  future if  we  are going  to  contain  inflation over  thelonger haul.  Beyond this,  the  Greenbook's projections  for  the coreCPI over  the next  couple of years  suggest  that  at  best we  are going  tohold the  line on  inflation, and that  is  only with the  help  of  thereweighting of  the  index.  The projections do not  show any  furtherprogress  toward our basic longer-term price  stability goal.  And ifthat were  the  actual  outcome  over  the  next  couple of  years,  thecredibility of  our  longer-term  strategy could be  reduced, at  least  tosome  degree.For  all  these reasons,  Mr. Chairman, I would  still  favor  a1/4  point increase  in  the  funds  rate  today.  Any  tightening nowobviously would  surprise the  markets.  I recognize  that  that  couldhave near-term consequences,  but  I think  it  could well help us  overthe  longer run.  In particular,  I worry about  the  possibility of  ascenario developing next year where we  finally begin to  see  somediscernible upward drift  in  the  inflation rate  at  a time when  theunemployment  rate may be moving  up  to  a more  sustainable,  longer-termlevel.  In  that  circumstance,  I think  it  would be quite difficult  tomake  a move  toward restraint.  I feel  a modest  move now could helpkeep us  out  of  that  trap.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  When people use  the word  "inflation,"  I alwaystranslate  that as  something having  to do  with the purchasing power  ofthe dollar.  I can't  get away  from  that notion.  So,  if  people  sayinflation  is  going to  be  higher,  I ask what  is  it  that  is  going tocause  the  purchasing power of  the dollar  to  erode  at  a faster rate  inthe  future than  it  has  in  the  past.  I wind up  thinking in  terms  of  anexcess  demand kind of  framework and  so  on.  I do  not believe  that  weare  in an  environment where  the purchasing power  of  the  dollar will beeroding  at  a faster  rate  for  the next  year or  two.  If  I thought  that,I would of  course conclude  that we have  to  adjust policy.  I have notseen  the  evidence  for  that,  and  I still  do not  see  the  mechanism thatis  going to produce  greater  inflation  from this point.  In  thesecircumstances,  if  we had not  already adopted asymmetry at  the  last  twomeetings,  I certainly would not want  to  go  asymmetric  toward restraintat  this  time.  I wish we  were not  already there,  but  since  we are,  Ican see  the wisdom of  not moving  to  symmetry and running the  risk  ofhaving  to  return to  asymmetry.  So,  I will  support  asymmetry towardtightening but  only because  we used  it  in the  directives  for  theprevious two  meetings.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I support  "B" asymmetric,  but  like  PresidentJordan  I do  not  feel  nearly as  "asymmetric" as  I did at  the  time ofthe  last meeting,  and  if  we were not  already there,  I think moving  to11/13/96-35-it would be questionable.  But  since we are  and we have  a winningformula, let's  stick  with it.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Central bankers worry a lot.  That  is  arequirement  for  the job.  But difficult  as  it  is  for us,  I believe  weought  to  take good news  when  it  comes.  Therefore, I think stayingwhere we  are with an  asymmetric directive  is more  than desirable atthis  point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  I do  not want  to  talk aboutsymmetry, so  I am going to  advocate a modest  increase  in  the  fundsrate.  I would be where Al  Broaddus came  out,  a 25  basis pointincrease.  My view is  basically that CPI  inflation has been  trendingup,  that  3 percent  inflation is  too high, and  that  the  risks  are  inthe direction  of  higher inflation,  at  least  if  it  is measured on  aconsistent basis.  We  should lean  against this,  and we  should do  so  inthe  context of  making clear  our  long-term  intentions.  I also  thinkthat  we should not  lull  ourselves  into  thinking  that we  can  in  factpredict  short-term developments  in the  real  economy and count  on  thesedevelopments  to  do  our  job for  us,  at  least  on a temporary basis.  Ialso agree with what Al  Broaddus  said  about  some of  the risks down  theroad.  Another  risk  is  one that Governor Lindsey pointed to;  itrelates  to  evidence of  some  speculative excesses  in  financial markets.By moving now we might be  able  to  avoid a bigger accident  in those

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Things have changed,  at  least  from myperspective,  since  the  last meeting.  I see a bit more  balance  in thefactors bearing on  the prospects  for growth going  forward.  At  thelast meeting, I saw all  the  risks  on  the  side of  faster  economicexpansion, but  I now see  some  counterbalancing developments.  Factorsthat  in my view inject  some negative prospects  into  the  growth pictureinclude  consumer debt,  the  trade  deficit,  and  some cooling in housingI tend  to  feel as  do Al  Broaddus  and Tom Melzer  that  there  areconsiderable risks  on  the  inflation side.  But I think  the perhapstemporary abatement  in economic  growth and the  injection  of  somenegative aspects  to  the growth outlook have  given us  a littlebreathing  room.  However,  I want  to  associate myself to  some extentwith what  Governor Lindsey has  said and what  Tom Melzer just  said.The  financial markets  are  acting as  if  interest  rates  only go  in onedirection, and with that  attitude  there  are  undoubtedly bets  beingmade  that are unwise now and will  grow to  be more unwise as  time  goesby.  We are  risking a major asset price bubble unless  some sense  ofcaution,  some sense  of  reality  is  injected  into  these  financialrelatively  soon.  All  of  that  said,  I could go with a 25  basis pointincrease at  this  point,  but  I can also  support your recommendation,Mr. Chairman.  We  have  some breathing  room, but  I think we need  toretain an  asymmetric directive.  So,  I would agree with you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.11/13/96-36-

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman,  I support your  recommendation foran unchanged and asymmetrical  directive.  In  fact,  I think  theasymmetrical directive  that we have had  in place,  and would retain,sends  a very important  signal  of  this Committee's  intention not  to  letinflation  creep higher.  I only hope  that  we are prepared to  move ifin  fact  the upside  risks  that we have  talked about  materialize.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman,  I support  the  recommendation for"B" asymmetric.  I think  it  is  important,  echoing what  some  otherpeople have  said here, that  we not  lull  ourselves  into  a sense  ofcomplacency.  If  we believe  the  Greenbook forecast,  the  core CPI,abstracting  from  improvements  in methodology by the Bureau of  LaborStatistics will  move up during  this  forecast period.  That  clearly  isnot  acceptable.  However, we recognize  that  there is  a lot  ofuncertainty in the  data, and we have not  seen  signs of  compensationincreases  or  of  price  increases  in  the  latest  data.  The key  in  termsof  the  strength of  the  economy, as  you point  out Mr.  Chairman, is  thelevel  of  consumer  spending going  forward.  So,  at  this point  I supportthe  recommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  As  I commented earlier,recent  developments have been  favorable,  and I believe  there  issomething  to  Ed Boehne's  observation  that we ought  to  take  the goodnews  when we  can get  it.  However,  it  still  seems  to me  that  theprincipal  risk that we  face  is  that  of more  inflation  than we haveforecast.  I laid  out  my basic  concerns having  to do  with taut  laborof  good news  on productivity, if  we  can  in  fact accurately measure  itor  observe  it.  But having  said all  that,  I do  think that  the  risk ofa meaningful  acceleration of  inflation has  in  fact  diminished.  Itlooks  to  me as  if  expectations  of  future  inflation  also havediminished among market participants,  judging by what  has beenhappening  in  the  bond market.  If  that  is  right,  then  for  a givennominal  short-term interest  rate, a given funds  rate,  the real  short-term interest  rate  is  at  least  a bit higher  today  than it  was  earlier.In sum,  I believe  that at  least  for now the  risk  of  anacceleration of  inflation has  been addressed, hopefully adequately, byhigher real  short-term interest  rates,  and I am prepared to  supportyour  recommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I continue  to  have  two  concerns.One  is  that  the  risks  of  inflation  remain on  the  up  side,  as  depictedin the  projections  that both  the  Greenbook and  our staff  have  laidout.  In  that  kind of  atmosphere  and  related attitudes  going  forward,I am  concerned about  signs  of a potential  financial  bubble.  Havingsaid  that, what you have  defined  is  an  environment  involving a fairamount  of  uncertainty about  activity in  the  real  economy, where  thatI would be  inclined  to  move now, but  I could  accept yourrecommendation  of  "B" asymmetric.11/13/96-37-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I support your  recommendation forno  change, and I can vote for  your recommendation to  stay withasymmetry  toward tightening.  It would be embarrassing  to  go  to asymmetric directive  and then  rapidly have  to  go back  to  asymmetry.  Onthe  other hand, if  the  economy weakens  further and more  sharply thanwe  expect,  it  could also be  embarrassing to  go  into  a downturn with atilt  toward tightening.  So,  like Governor Rivlin,  I do  not  feelnearly  as  "asymmetric" as  I did at  the  last  two  or  three meetings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Mr.Chairman, I support your  recommendation of"B" asymmetric.  We  should not be  changing  course now, particularlywhen we are  in  the  middle of  getting more current  inflation data.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Mr. Chairman, I support  your recommendation.  Ithink that an  asymmetric directive  is warranted  for  all  of  the reasonsenunciated  in  the Greenbook.  I believe  the  inflation risk definitelyremains  asymmetric.  I also  share  Governor Lindsey's and  PresidentMinehan's  concern about  euphoria  in  asset markets.  On  balance,though,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  incremental  data  since  our  lastmeeting point  toward more moderate growth  than last  time as  well  as  abetter inflation performance.  I would consider  it  perfectly possiblefor  demand  to end up moderating more  than the  Greenbook  assumes,eliminating  the excess  pressure in  the  labor market and  any need  foradditional monetary tightening.  So,  for now I am certainlycomfortable with more  watchful waiting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman, I support  your recommendation.  Ithink  it  is  important when we  think about  symmetry and asymmetry thatwe not  focus  too much  on  conditions  in  the current  quarter or even  thenext  quarter.  When we  have unemployment of  5.2  percent, we  cantolerate  a substantial  short-term weakening  of  the  economy and stillwant  to  be poised on the  asymmetric  side toward tightening.  It  wouldtake,  for example,  two  to  three  quarters  of  growth in  the  1-1/2  to  2percent  range  just  to get  the  unemployment rate  moving back  toward5-1/2 percent,  which arguably means  no more  acceleration in pressureson  resources and inflation.  So,  I think that being asymmetric  isexactly the  right  thing  to  do,  and frankly I think we  are  going to  bethere  for  quite  a while because  I do  not see  any  signs  that  we aregoing to  be  removing inflation pressures  in  the  economy very quickly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Finally, Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman,  I support your recommendation  forno  change in  policy.  Indeed, given  that  the  recent data  suggest that11/13/96-38-the  risks  have become more balanced,  I am more comfortable  supportinga proposal  of unchanged policy  than  I was at  the  last meeting.  Istill  think the major risk  is  that  inflation will  begin to rise  overthe next year.  An asymmetric  directive reminds us  of  the  importanceof remaining vigilant in  the  face  of  this risk, and I thereforesupport your proposal  to  retain  the current  policy posture.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Would you read the directivewhich encompasses  that?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I will be  reading  from page  12  in  the Bluebook:"In  the  implementation of policy for the  immediate  future,  theCommittee  seeks  to maintain the  existing degree of  pressure on reservepositions.  In  the  context  of  the  Committee's  long-run objectives  forprice  stability and sustainable economic  growth,  and giving  carefulconsideration  to  economic,  financial,  and monetary developments,somewhat  greater reserve  restraint would or  slightly lesser reserverestraint  might be acceptable in  the  intermeeting period.  Thecontemplated reserve  conditions  are  expected to be  consistent withmoderate growth  in M2  and relatively  strong expansion in M3  overcoming months."
