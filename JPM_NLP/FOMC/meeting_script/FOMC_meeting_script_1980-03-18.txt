CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  meeting can  come  to  order,  gentlemenand  lady.  We  have  a  lot  of  business  to  dispose  of  at  the  start  and Iwill  try  to  find my agenda,  if  you will  excuse me a moment.  We  havethe  election  of  officers.  First  of  all,  we  have  the  election  of  theChairman--I  keep getting  reminded  that  this  position  is  not  statutory--and we need a nomination.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Mr. Chairman, after  great  soul-searching untillate  last  night, and  contrary  to  the exhortations  of  many peoplearound this  table,  I have decided  to  nominate  Paul  Volcker as  Chairmanof  the  FOMC!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Do we  have  a  second?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Second.  You  saved him, Fred!

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Pressure will  do  it  every  time!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Is  there  an  objection?  I shouldn't put  itthat  way!Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  I move  that  the  nominations be  closed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection.  We need a Vice

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Mr.  Chairman,  I nominate  Anthony Solomon  asVice  Chairman of  the  FOMC.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  can't  take  effect  until  he  takesoffice,  so  it  would have  to be  dependent  upon his April  1 inaugurationdate.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection we will  have Mr.  Solomonbecome Vice  Chairman upon his  taking  office.  We have  staff officersto  select.  As  one  of  those  staff  officers,  I would nominate Mr.Altmann to  be  Secretary.  Perhaps Mr.  Altmann will  read the rest  ofthe  nominees.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Fine.Assistant Secretary, Normand Bernard;General  Counsel,  Neal  Petersen;Deputy General  Counsel,  James  Oltmann;Assistant General  Counsel,  Robert  Mannion;Economist,  Stephen  Axilrod;Adviser  for Market  Operations,  Alan Holmes;Associate Economists  from the  Board:Edward Ettin;George  Henry;Peter Keir;James  Kichline;Edwin Truman;  andJoseph Zeisel.3/18/80-2-Associate Economists  from the  Reserve  Banks:Anatol  Balbach;John  Davis;Richard Davis;Thomas  Davis;  andRobert  Eisenmenger.That's  the  list,  Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Apart  from the  fact  that  we  seem  to have  aplenitude  of Davises--pardon me?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  And no Managers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  selection of  the Managers  comes  in  alater  agenda  item.  If  there  are no  objections  to  those  officers,  theywill be  appointed.  Now we need  a Federal  Reserve  Bank  to  executetransactions  for  the System Open Market Account.  That  hastraditionally, as  you know, been  the New York  Bank.  Do we have  amotion  to  that  effect?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  So  moved.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection.  Now we need to  selectthe Managers.  The  present  Managers  are Mr.  Sternlight, DomesticOperations  and Mr.  Pardee,  Foreign  Operations.  Do  we have  a motion to[reappointment  them]?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  So moved.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection  those  appointments  aremade.  Now we need  to  approve  the minutes  of  the  last  meeting.  Do wehave a motion?

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  So  moved.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Do we  have  a  second?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection,  the  minutes  areapproved.  And  I guess we are  now  to  the report  on  foreign  operationssince  the  last meeting, Mr.  Pardee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  Scott,  you mentioned the  possibility  that  someparties  may be  suffering major  losses  by  reason of  the decline  in  theprice  of  gold.  Would that  include  any major  commercial  banks?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  Well,  not  U.S.  banks.  A  few  of  them haveoperations  in gold, but  they are mainly merchandisers  of  gold  in  thatthey buy from  either  the  IMF  or out  of  European  markets,  or  in  thepast  from  the  U.S.  Treasury.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  [What  about]  European banks?3/18/80

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  One  or  two European banks  could be sitting  onlosses.  On  the  other hand,  they are very well  capitalized.  I  thinkthey  can withstand such  losses.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Scott, you  said  that  the  fundamentals--inflation expectations,  the  current account,  and  so  forth--were  not  infavor  of  the  dollar.  Do you  see continuing  strong pressure  for  thedollar  to  go  up  in  the  face  of  that?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  No,  one  of  the  reasons  we repaid our  debt  soquickly was  that  there  is  the  risk of  a snapback.  As  I say,  the onlything that  is  supporting us  at  the moment  is  really  the  interest  ratedifferential.  Market  expectations  toward  the dollar  are  still  verybearish.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  The  question I would  like  to  raise more  broadlyis,  insofar  as  we do  anything  in  the market  at  all,  should we restrainthe  dollar  more than we  have?  We  share with the  Bundesbank  in  theproceeds of  their  support  operation.  In  any event,  if  there  is  astrong movement,  one can't do  very much.  But  if  the  dollar  goes  up,say,  three pfennigs  in one  day, wouldn't  it  be  better  to  absorb someof  that?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARDEE.  Well,  the  rise of  the  dollar has been  almosttotally during  the  European  hours,  and  the Bundesbank has  beenin  oneprepared to operation or  the  other.  By the  time we  come  in,  the  market  is  prettylimp.  We have been able  to  do  small  amounts.  We haven't wanted  to  dotoo much for  fear  that  the market  psychology would  turn against ussaying:  "Aha, the United  States  is  trying  to  drive  the  dollar downagain."  So  it's  a very, very delicate  question.  On the  other  hand,the Bundesbank has  had  some  of  the  same problems with  the mark that  wehad back  last  fall  when  the  dollar was  going down  and we were  havingtrouble  stopping  the  slide,  even though we  were  intervening  in bigamounts.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  The market moves  against  the  intervention iswhat you  are  saying.  The  dollar  goes  up  in  Frankfurt  against  theBundesbank intervention and doesn't  go  up  in New York despite  theabsence  of  intervention.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARDEE.  We have been prepared  to  operate  a  little, but[the  dollar]  has been pretty steady  in  New York.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  need to  ratify  the  transactions  sincethe  last meeting.  Do we have  a motion?  Second?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [Approved]  without  objection.  You have  arecommendation?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  For once  I don't  have  to  recommend any  swaprenewals.  But  I do  have  a rather  complicated  transaction to  describe,so  that  I can be authorized  to  complete  it.  When  the  dollar  came  intodemand  in late  February,  early March, the  Bundesbank supplemented  itsspot  sales  of  dollars  with  forward  sales  of  dollars  against marks  fordelivery in  early May.  The  choice  of  dates was  related  to  the3/18/80equivalent of  marks.  Since  the  Bundesbankdomestic  liquidity  situation in Germany.  Mark  liquidity was  expectedto  be more  ample  in  early May  than  in early March, so  the  forwardsales  of  the dollar  would help mop  up  some  of  that  excess  liquidity.The  total  was was  sharing  half  of  the mark proceeds  of  its  spot  sales  of  dollarswith us  at  the  time,  and we  had no  idea how  long  the  dollar wouldremain  in demand, we  asked them  if  they might  also  share  the proceedsof  the  forward sales.  It  took  them  several  days  to  come  back with ananswer;  and when they did,  they  set  some  conditions  that  requiredconsultations  on our  side within  the  Federal  Reserve  and with theTreasury.  In  the meantime  the dollar  continued  to  rise  and  the  Systemcontinued  to make  good progress  in  repaying  swap debt.  In view of  theTreasury's  need for marks  to  cover  the Carter  notes,  we  finallyagreed.  In  response,  the Bundesbank  raised no objection.  But  afterfurther  review on  their  part,  they insisted  that  the  Federal  Reserveas  the  central  bank  of  the United  States  be  the  direct  counterparty onthe  forward  contracts  rather  than  the  U.S. Treasury.Subject to  your  approval,  the  solution we have worked out  isthat  the  System would enter  into  two  sets  of  forward  contracts:  onewith the Bundesbank  to  obtain  the marks directly  from it,  so  that  asthe  central  bank of  the United  States  we are  sharing  in  thatoperation;  and  the  other between  the Federal  Reserve  and  the  Treasuryto  pass  the  marks directly on  to  the Exchange  Stabilization  Fund.These  transactions  would be  at  the  same  rates,  so  there  is  neitherprofit  nor  loss  to  the  System.  The  reason  I am laying  this  out  to youis  that  the  Bundesbankdifficult  for me  to  argue  that  these  transactions would beAs  Manager, it  isExceptions  have  tobe expressly  authorized by  the  Committee.  Consequently, I amrequesting authority from  the  Committee to make  an  explicit  exceptionto  the  rule  so  that  we  can complete  the deal.  The Treasury needs  theunder  the  Carter notes.  Since  some  of  the  Treasury's mark debt  is  ateven higher  mark rates  than  those  on  these contracts,  the  costcomparisons  are not excessively  unfavorable to  the  Treasury.Moreover,  should the  System need  to  incur  additional  swap  debt beforefrom us  so  that we  could use  the marks  in  repayment.  The  transactionsare  quite  complicated but  essentially mean that  the U.S.  authoritieswill  gain  an  additional should  the  occasion arise.  That's my recommendation.worth of marks  to work with

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  But  at what  cost?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARDEE.  Yes.I take  it?3/18/80

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.it's  the  Treasury who bears  [the  cost],  and they want  to bear  it.in  today's  markets,

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  We don't  know where  the  rate  will be  in May.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.  Why  does  the  Bundesbank

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  It's a matter of  that  nature, yes.  They prefer

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Was  the  Treasury a party to  the  originalagreement,  Scott?  That  is,  did  they  agree  that  those  forwards  oughtto be  sold?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  No,  but they were  the  ones  who  suggested that  weshould raise  the  question  of  this  50-50  sharing with the  Bundesbank.As  soon  as  they heard about  it,  they were  the  ones who pressed theDesk to  inquire whether  the  Germans would be prepared  to--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  was  the  Bundesbank's decision  to buy  inthe  first place;  but  as  soon as  the Treasury heard about  it,  theywanted  [to  participate].

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  There was  no  objection raised by Treasury,  orfor  that matter  by the  Federal  Reserve.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Does  that  reflect  the judgment  of  the  Treasuryon  the  outlook  for  the dollar?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  All  this  discussion  took place when  [thetransaction]  was  at  about  the market  rate.  It's  just  that with thelapse of  two  or  three  weeks  since  the  transaction  took place  it's  nolonger  the  market  rate.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Scott,  at what rate  do  we  get  these marks back[from]  the  Treasury, if  we  need them?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARDEE.  Well,  I am  sure  the  Treasury would insist  on arate  of  around  175,  176.  The  average  rate is  175-1/2  or thereabouts.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think we probably wouldn't want  themback.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  No,  if  the  situation arises,  I will  [undertake]a very  complicated negotiation to  avoid our  getting  stuck with them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  this  seems more technical  to  me  thanreal.  The  original  transaction was  at  a market rate  and what we  aredoing  is  back-dating  in  some  sense--not  literally back-dating, butit's  no  longer  at  the market  rate.  The  Treasury wants  the marks  andwe are  a  conduit.  I don't  see  any big problem in this  myself.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I move we  accept  this.3/18/80-6-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Is  there  any real  question  about  it?  Ithink we  just have  to  write  the  exception  in  such a way  so  that  thecircumstances  are  clear  as  to  the  fact  that  this was  not  an off-markettransaction when  it  took place.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  And we're not  committed to  buy  them back  fromTreasury?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  I don't  see  that we  should becommitted.  I don't understand that  part.  I don't  see where we wouldwant  to  buy them back.  If  we  have  to  intervene  on  the  other  side,  theTreasury can use  the  [mark]  balances  [it  holds]  and  it  would take  theloss.  I don't  think we want  to  take  them back at  the  off-market rate.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  This was  a  transaction that  was  initiated  by theGermans  and  it  automatically  involved us  to  the  extent  of  50  percent?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  didn't  automatically.  They've beengiving us  50  percent  of  their  intervention at  our request  and  thisfalls  into  that pattern.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  They  originated  the  intervention but  theyhave been  giving us  50  percent,  and  they will  give us  50  percent  ofthis.  It  just  happens  to  be  a  forward  transaction which hasn't been[consummated]  yet.  It  falls  into  the  regular pattern, but what  isdifferent  about  it  is  that  it  is  a forward  transaction.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Forward, yes.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Do  they regularly engage  in  forwardtransactions?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  I believe  they did  it  for  liquidityreasons.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  Yes,  liquidity.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  They were  doing a  lot  of  intervention andthe  effect was  to  drain liquidity.  They  didn't want to  drain  thatmuch  liquidity at  the  time,  so  they did a  forward.  That's  why theydid it,  as  I understand.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  In  fact  they  are now

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think  they have  done  any  forwardtransactions  recently.  This  was  all  during  a limited period.  Well,without  objection we will provide  that  exception.  Mr.  Sternlight.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  Paul, before you  turn  to  that:  What's  our posturefor  the  month ahead  in  this  area as  the markets  bubble?3/18/80

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think Mr.  Pardee  has described  ourpresent  posture.  We would certainly buy  some marks,  to  the  extentthat  the mark  is  at  these  levels  and  to  the  extent  that  it  is  strongin New York.  But  as  he  points  out,  it  hasn't been  terribly  strong  inNew York.  The  Bundesbank has  agreed  to  share with us  theirintervention, but  we will  pass  it  on  to  the  Treasury at  this  pointsince we  are  out  of  debt  and  the  Treasury  is  under water by whateverthe  number  is  now.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  $3.3  billion.  Yes, we  can  continue;  and  theyare continuing  to  share.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Do we have  any mark balances now?  We  havea  few mark balances,  don't we?

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  Yes,  $100  million worth of  marks.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Essentially, we will  pass along  our  shareof  their  intervention  to  the  Treasury  until  the  Treasury  getsbalanced.  If  the  dollar  remains  that  strong and  indeed we do  anyintervention in New York, we will pass  that  on  to  the  Treasury, too.

[SECTION]

MR. PARDEE.  Yes,  everything.  The problem will  remain if  thedollar  comes  under  selling pressure.  I think we  are going  to have  togive  quite  a bit  of  ground before we  start  operating very vigorouslyin defense  of  the  dollar because  the Bundesbank  certainly won't  helpus  for  a  long ways  down.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  There is  a  great  concern  in  Europegenerally about  their  currencies  depreciating because  of  the internalinflationary repercussions,  and everybody wants  their  currencies  toappreciate  at  this  point.  I  think  it's  only that  our  interest  rateshave prevailed here  at  the moment.  But  the danger  is  that  they willraise  their  interest  rates,  which is  one  consideration we  had in mindin handling our discount  rate  the way we  did--not  to  give  them  such  astrong  signal  for  raising  their  interest  rates.  I am not  sure  we  aregoing to  avoid  it  anyway, but  it  was quite  clear when I was  over  therelast  week that  they were not  looking  forward with  any joy  to  anincrease  in  the  U.S.  discount  rate.  They  felt  it  would  force  them toraise  their rates.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Shall  I proceed, Mr.  Chairman?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Peter, would you have been  able to  come  closerto  the  total  reserve path  if we had  contemporaneous  accounting?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  I really don't  think  it  would have mattereda great  deal,  President Morris.  I have  not  regarded  the  laggedaccounting as  a  significant  impediment  to  achieving the  [path],  aslong as  we  are  able  to make  the  kinds  of  adjustments  we make  in  thenonborrowed path  to  bring speedier  adjustments  to  the  growth  of  theaggregates.  I don't  think  it  matters  a great  deal.3/18/80

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Isn't  it  true  that  the  one-week bulge  in  themoney  supply practically made  it  impossible for you  to  hit  the  totalreserve path  in  the  last  three weeks?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  even with contemporaneous  accounting,we  are  going to  get bulges  at  times;  and if  we  didn't provide  thereserves,  [the  reserve needs]  would be met  at  the  discount window.The banks  would have  to borrow, or  would have  to do  something,  to  getthe  reserves  to  meet  their  requirements.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  You  do  have to  be  prepared to  change yournonborrowed path  frequently, I take  it,  as  these  borrowings numberscome  out  in ways  that  are  unexpected.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think  that  is  right.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  There  will be  a lot more  of  that  in  the  future,too,  Peter.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Certainly  so,  given the new look at  thediscount window.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  But,  Chuck, how do you know which way it'sgoing?  If we  are making an  adjustment  in the  nonborrowed, borrowingsgo up.  It's  hard to  see which one  comes  first  here.  If  we  lower  thenonborrowed path,  that almost  dictates  an  increase  in  the  borrowings.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  that  certainly  is  true.  But  I think we  doit  by  looking at  total  reserves,  too--by  seeing what's  happening  intotal  reserves  relative  to  our path.  What  I worry about  is  that  therenonmember borrowers  who will  come  in  once  this  bill  passes.  So wecould have  a surge  in borrowing, which is  not  really a reservebalancing decision but  just a portfolio balancing  decision on  the  partof  those  institutions,  that we would  need to  adjust  for  in  ournonborrowed  [path].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  There  is  no  question that  if  new borrowerscome  in  for  emergency reasons  or  because  they are  new, we  will  have  tomake an  adjustment to  allow for  that.  But  I think  this  elasticity  inthe borrowing  numbers  is  very bothersome whether we  are  oncontemporaneous  or  lagged accounting.  The  contemporaneous  might help.When  are we  going to  have  our report, Mr. Axilrod?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  at  any  time.  Following the  previous FOMCdiscussion, we  looked up  all  our  old work on  the various  proposalsthat  the  Presidents put  forward.  And we'd be  prepared to  bring  theissue  of  lagged reserve  accounting plus  some  of  those  other  issuesbefore  the  Board at  any time.  If  the Board were going to  consider it,I would  suggest  that  it be  done  in  such  a way that  if  any change weremade,  it  could go  into  effect when  the  new  [law]  goes  into  effect--that  is,  six months  from  the  time of  [its  enactment].  So,  in  thattime  frame--within a couple  of  months  or earlier--we would certainlybe  prepared  to  bring something  to  the Committee.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  are  going  to be  prepared to  have adiscussion of  that  at  our next meeting?3/18/80

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Do  you mean  on the  other measures  in  additionto  the  lagged  reserve  accounting  that  the  Committee  has  alreadydiscussed or  just--?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  are  they?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  lagged  reserve  accounting,  staggeredreserve  settlements,  and a  few  other  things.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  You  are  going to  be prepared  with all  ofthis?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well, we  could be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let's  try to  do  that.  I think  it's  amajor  hazard to  introduce  something  that  is  going to  be  as  difficultas  this  for  the  banks  to  handle  on  top of  all  this  other  stuff  that wehave  been giving  them.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  My  only point was  that  if  the  Board and  theCommittee wanted to  do away with  lagged  reserve  accounting,  the  timeto  do  away with it  is  when the whole  new reserve  system  goes  intoeffect,  [when  it  is]  applicable  to  other  institutions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I understand  that  consideration.  Mr.Roos.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  I think my question was  probably answered, Mr.Chairman.  As  I understand this  process,  every day you have  a totalreserve path  target  in mind, right?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  I would  say that  what we have  in mind  fromday  to  day  is  more  of  a nonborrowed  objective.  Although  as  Idescribed,  in certain  circumstances,  such as  when we  get a bulge  ofborrowing over  the weekend  that  may have been caused by banksanticipating a discount  rate action,  it  seems  sensible  to  come  inbelow,  let's  say,  a nonborrowed interim objective.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  But  the  figure  on borrowings  is  available  to youon  a  [daily  basis]?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Oh,  I get  a tentative  figure every day, yes.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  So,  if  you  have  a total  reserve  figure  in mind andyou  know what  the borrowings  are,  can't  the  adjustment  almostautomatically be made  on the nonborrowed  side to  give  you the  total?If  you know borrowings  and  if  you know what  total  reserves  should be,then can't you  simply  adjust  the nonborrowed part  of  this  to  give  youthe  total reserves  you want?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That's  where  the  lag  comes  in.  We have  to meetthe  [required]  reserves.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  know the  required  reserves;  we  can'tchange  the  required reserves  for  that particular  week.  And therequired reserves  govern the  total  reserves.3/18/80-10-

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  I recognize  that.  But  if  we offset,  or  if  wedon't  supply  the  required reserves,  what happens?  Do we  have  toaccommodate  the  needs  of  the  banks?  Or  could we  not  stick by ourtotal  reserve  target,  and if  they are  short,  they would have  toscramble  to  adjust  their operations  to what we  want  to  do.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  If  we don't provide  the  reserves  innonborrowed form,  they will have  to  get  the  reserves  either  throughborrowings  or be  deficient  in  their  reserves.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Is  that  a bad  thing?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  it  depends  on what  degree  of  pressurewe want  to  impose  on  them  at  that  moment.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Are we  fearful  that  interest  rates  will  [rise]?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  The  Committee has  set  bounds  on the  fundsrate.  If  total  reserves  were  the  overriding objective,  bar nothing,then we  could drive  interest rates  up to  just  about  any point,  I wouldthink.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And even  then we  can't  affect  totalreserves.  The banks  are  just  going  to  borrow.  What  we  can affect  ishow much  they borrow  in any particular week.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  But we  can  affect  the degree  of  pressure  theyare under  so  that  they will  start  making adjustments.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Well, we  do  want  to  do  that,  don't  we?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  And we did  that.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I think we get  an  arithmetic  impossibility iftotal  reserves are  set  and we  change nonborrowed  reserves  for  everydollar  change that  occurs  in borrowings  to try to  go  along  a path wehave  in mind for  total reserves.  It  makes  it  impossible  for  thebanking  system  to balance,  given  the  fact  that we  have  a  two-week lagon deposits.  And they would be  in violation of  the  law.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  they  can  [have  a]  reserve deficiency  fora week, for  a little  bit.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  But  it's  not very big.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  The  important  point  really is  the  one you made awhile  ago,  Chuck, about  the  need for  reassessing  the  nonborrowedreserve  target more  frequently.  I was  on  the  call  and  I  sensed  thatwe  really  ought  to  be  doing that;  we did  speed it  up  last month, but  Iwould like  to  see  even more.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  [Unintelligible]  keep  the  level  of borrowedreserves at  about what we would hope  to  have  it.  And to  the  surpriseof most,  if  not  all  of us,  the  necessity of  frequent  adjustments  just3/18/80-11-didn't come  along  for a long time.  It  looks  as  if  perhaps  Februarymight have been the month when  it  could have been used.  The  question,as you look back  in  a little  post-mortem, Peter,  is whether  it wouldhave made  any difference.  Would it  have helped  the  cause,  so  tospeak,  in preventing  total  reserves  from getting  too  big, if  we  haddone what we  thought  we would have to  do  on that  October  6 game  plan,which  is  to  put  the  discount rate up?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  of  course,  the  discount rate was movedin  the middle of  February along with  the Desk  taking measures  toimpose  greater reserve restraint.  There was  a certain  amount  ofpressure  that emerged  almost  automatically out  of  the  process  just  byour  sticking to  our nonborrowed path when  the banks were  demandingadditional  reserves.  That automatically imposed  some  increased needfor  borrowing.  And then a further  downward adjustment  was made  in  thenonborrowed path  to  increase  the degree  of pressure,  and at  about  thesame  time  the  discount rate was  raised.  So by  forcing  the banks  toborrow--I  think it  was around  $1.8  billion--at  an even higher  discountrate, we  put  still  greater upward pressure  [on  rates].  What we  got,as  I described, was  a very substantial move  in  short-term rates  of  3or  4 percentage points  over  a few weeks.  And  I think  it  got somebanks  feeling  that  they were  staring very hard at  the  possibility of  acrunch and the  prospect  of  just  not being able  to  fund  themselves.  Soin  that  sense the  program is  working;  it  has  [produced]  very realrestraint  for the  banking system.  I don't  know that  bigger moves  orearlier moves  in  the  discount rate would have  done  anything more thanwas being  done  [through  our operations].  I don't  know that we  shouldhave  [done]  more  because I think we were  imposing quite  a bit  ofrestraint.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  One  other question, Mr. Chairman.  I would liketo ask  Steve something  in  this  case,  in  conjunction with  the Bluebookalternatives.  Steve, would  it  be reasonable  or  even feasible  for  thestaff  to  attempt  to  estimate a level  of  the  discount  rate that  wouldbe  consistent with the money growth  targets?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I share much of  what  Mr. Sternlight  says.If  you  want to  estimate an  interest  rate  that would produce  theseresults--I  was hoping this  method would get  away  from that a little--it  seems  to me  that,  if  anything,  it  would be more  like  the  federalfunds  rate.  In essence,  if  you look over  a long  enough time period,it  doesn't matter very much what  part  of  the  total  reserves  issupplied by nonborrowed reserves and what part  is  borrowed.  Whatreally matters  for determining  the money  supply  is  the  amount  ofreserves,  the  total  base out  there  to  support money in  some multipliersense.  And over  a  long  enough period, it  can't  really matter whetherthat's  through nonborrowed reserves  or borrowed reserves.  In  the veryshort  run because  of  this mix, with required reserves  fixed, it  doesmatter  because it  affects  the behavior  of  the  funds  rate given  thediscount  rate.  But  if  we put  in  a high  discount  rate, then  for  anygiven total  reserves we would have  less  borrowed reserves and morenonborrowed.  If  our  estimate  of  the discount rate  is  low, we'd havethe  reverse situation.  So, while we could do  that, we would simply bechanging  the  mix between nonborrowed and borrowed reserves  for  anygiven level  of  total  reserves  that would  support  the money supply.  Idon't  think  that  would be  very helpful  to  you;  we  would be glad to  doit,  of  course.  I think  in February the  alternatives before  theCommittee were:  making an  adjustment  in  the  funds  rate  fast by3/18/80-12-raising  the  discount  rate;  making it  more moderately by graduallylowering the  nonborrowed path;  or making  it  even more moderately bykeeping  the nonborrowed path  and  letting a gentle  rise  in borrowingtake  place instead of  a rapid rise.  What was  actually done was  tohave  a small  rise  in  the  discount  rate  and a reduction in  thenonborrowed path, which was  somewhere  in between all  thosealternatives.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Well,  if  I could,  I'd  just  raise one  more point.In  asking my own  staff  to  review what went  on during  that  Februaryperiod, it  seemed pretty clear  to us  that  the staff  here  and in NewYork had done  a fine  job  of  guessing what  the multiplier was  going tobe, what  the  total  reserves  should be, and what  the nonborrowed pathshould be.  There  was very fine work on  that.  Yet  the  net  outcome wasthat  total  reserves got  out  of  hand on  the  up side  for a while.  WhatI am  trying to  get  to  the  bottom of,  with the benefit  of  hindsight,  ishow you  and Peter  now think  that  could be headed off  in the  future.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  our views  are  probably marginallydifferent.  A difference  is  that  I might  allege  that we could hit  thetotal  reserve path week  to week.  I don't  think  it's very important  todo  it,  but we  could without  lagged reserve  accounting.  But we'd haveto  have very large movements  in  the  federal  funds  rate because  we'dhave  to  force  the  banks, within  the  statement week, to  adjust  theirdeposits to  the  total  reserves we'd put  out  there.  We'd have  to  forcethem to  do  it.  Without  lagged reserve  accounting  that  is  possible.With lagged reserve accounting, that  could also  occur.  If  we  allowenough pressure on  the  funds  rate,  they could make the  adjustments  indeposits but we just  won't  see  it  in  total reserves  until  two weekslater.  So within  a very short-run period it  would look as  if we weremissing  our  total  reserves;  but  actually we'd be getting  adjustmentsin  deposits  that would be  [evident]  in required reserves  two  weekslater and we'd really not be  off  very badly.  We would just  be overpath for  a while  and then we'd be back  on path.  That's  the  essence  ofwhat Mr. Sternlight  is  saying  and I wouldn't quarrel with  thatparticular statement.  Indeed,  the money supply  is  coming back ontarget  now, or  seemingly so,  if March turns  out  as  we  are projectingit.  There has  been a rapid  response  to  the rise  in  the  funds  ratethat  has occurred,  just  as  happened in  October, which may be  acoincidence or  it  may be  that  the  lags  [in  response  to changes  in]  thefunds  rate are not  six months  [but  are  closer to]  one  day.  It's  hardto  believe the  latter but  something  like  that  has happened  for  twosuccessive periods.  I am not  sure whether I have  answered thequestion, but  I think I at  least  came  close  to  it.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  May I ask Steve a question?  The  advocates  ofcontemporaneous  reserve accounting  argue that  there would be  lessvolatility in  the  funds  rate  than under  lagged accounting.  Do yousubscribe  to  that?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Oh no,  I think there would be quite  a bit more,for  one  reason.  The  one  [internal]  reason  is  that Mr.  Sternlightreally won't be  "able"--and I put  the word  in quotes because  I don'tmean that  he's  really managing  the  funds  rate--to  adapt his  operationsas  readily because  in  the  current week he won't know requiredreserves.  [Suppose]  this  week we're  going to  provide  $100  in  totalreserves. Given the  fluctuations  in  deposits that  occur from week toweek, we  really won't  know whether  the  required reserves  in the week3/18/80-13-relative to  the  $100  in  total  reserves would be  $20  or  $90.  If  theyturn  out  to  be  $20,  Mr.  Sternlight  is  going  to  find  that  as  he puts  innonborrowed reserves,  there  are going  to  be  huge  declines  in borrowingand huge declines  in  the  federal  funds  rate.  And he's not  going  tohave any alternative but  to  chase  those  borrowings  down and  put  inmore  nonborrowed.  Because  of  the volatility  of  deposits week  to week,I  think we'd be  certain  to get more  fluctuations in  the  federal  fundsrate.  However, with  the  system we're now  operating on, where  he  knowsrequired reserves  and we make  adjustments  on  an  average path  for  afour-week period, we make  those adjustments  so  that we  [take  intoaccount]  the  required  reserve pattern  that we  know  for  certain  overthe  two weeks  ahead.  And we tend  to  make  the  borrowings  the  same  ineach of  those weeks.  So we  let  nonborrowed reserves vary with  thedeposits while  tending  to hold the  borrowing stable  in an average  pathfor a  four-week period.  I know that  sounds  like  gobbledygook, but  itis  what  we  do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I wonder  if  I may ask  two  questions?  The  firstone is  to  Steve.  Steve,  on  contemporaneous  reserve accounting, howmuch of  a  change  in deposits would you need in  order  to  sweat  out  $1of  reserve  deficiency?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I am  not  sure  I get  the  gist  of  your question,Governor  Wallich.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  depends  on what  the  multiplier  is.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  The multiplier  on  demand deposits  at  the  momentis  roughly  6.  So  if we  took  put  in  $1  of  reserves,  we  ought  to get  $6more,  roughly,  in demand deposits.  But  that  is  not  certain;  if  we putin reserves,  they may end  up  in currency  or  anywhere  else  for  thatmatter.  But  that's  the multiplier on  demand deposits;  it's  a  lothigher on  time  deposits.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  The point  I am trying  to get  at  is:  Isn't  theadditional  adjustment you get  from contemporaneous  reserve  accountingrelatively  small?  You need a very large movement  in deposits  in orderto  overcome a  small  deficiency or  surplus  of  reserves.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Contemporaneous  reserve  accounting,  as nearlyas  I can  tell,  does  only  two  things  for  you.  First,  it  absolutely canremove  interest  rates  in  some  sense  from your  consideration.  If  youbelieved that  there  was  a multiplier  that  the  staff  could predict, youcould  set  total  reserves;  you'd have  to  chase  borrowing up  and  downbut you could come  closer  to  hitting  that  total  reserve  target  in  agiven week.  Lord knows what  interest  rates you'd have, but you mighthave the  money supply.  So  the  interest  rates  would be  forced toadjust  to  the  reserves.  We wouldn't be  doing what we  do  now, which insome  sense  is  to make  adjustments  in  nonborrowed  reserves  todeliberately force more interest  rate pressure  on the  system.  Thesystem would evolve  its  own interest  rate pressure  either up or downas  we put  in  the  total  reserves.  So  contemporaneous would do  that  foryou;  it  would remove  some  little  element  of prediction we  still  haveas  to what  interest  rates  we want  to  see  in  order  to  achieve the moneysupply  [objectives].  That  element  is  left  in  lagged reserveaccounting.  The  other  thing  it  does,  of  course,  is  to  speed up  the3/18/80-14-response by 2 weeks.  The latter  isn't all  that  important  presumablybecause 2 weeks  out  of  52  weeks  is  not any big  deal.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  And you  can anticipate  it  anyway but--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  What  it  really does,  in my mind, is  to removethe necessity of making judgments  about where you want  interest ratesto be.  But  that's  a judgment  the  Committee may not want  to remove.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We'd have  to  be willing  to  let  the  interestrates go anywhere.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We will  have  to  have an  exhaustivediscussion of  these  questions when we put contemporaneous  reserveaccounting squarely on  the table,  so  perhaps we  shouldn't  waste toomuch time  now.  I don't  think  we  are  going to  change  [our  procedures]at  this  meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  May I ask my other  question?  Peter, whatdetermines your decision to  buy coupons?  You mentioned that youbought  nearly $1/2  billion.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  we were in  the  midst of  a period  ofsizable reserve provision  and  it was  a judgment  that we  should divideup  that purchase.  We  anticipated  the need to provide  for  an outrightincrease in  the  portfolio of  some  $1-1/2  billion.  It  seemedappropriate  to do  the  bulk of  it  in  the bill  area, but  we had notbought  any coupon  issues  for  a few months  and just  in  accord with thepast  dispersion of  our buying  it  seemed appropriate  to  do  some portionof  it  in  coupons.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Would you have  done  about  the  same  had the  bond

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  We want  to keep  in mind that we don't wantto buy at  a time when  issues  are very scarce and we'd  have a sharpimpact on prices.  Certainly  the  fact  that  the  coupons were  availablewould make  some marginal  difference in  our decisions.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Yes, so  you were  stabilizing the market?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  We did a bum job  of  stabilizing!

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Unsuccessful.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  I would like  to ask what may be  the  samequestion John  Balles  asked but  in  a little different  way.  Had weraised the  discount rate  early  in March, having in mind that  throughthe period total  reserves would be  over  [path]  by about  $700  millionplus, would you not  [conclude]  that we'd have  come  closer  to  the  totalreserve path and  that  the adjustment would have  been a bit quicker?  Iguess  the  alternate  question is:  What would you have projected  forinterest rates?  Would they have been any higher  absent theanticipation  [of  a discount  rate  move]  that  was going on?3/18/80-15-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  If  you  had taken  a  further upward discount  rateaction from  13  percent,  say,  to  15  percent,  I would have  predicted afaster  adjustment  of  the money  supply only if  that  rise  in  thediscount  rate  also meant that  you were  going  to  permit  the  federalfunds  rate  to rise  substantially.  If  you  weren't going  to  permit  thefederal  funds rate  to  rise substantially,  I would  assume  that  thatupward adjustment  in  the discount  rate would merely have meant  thattotal  reserves would be the  same  over  time  but with  less  borrowing andmore nonborrowed.  But  if  you  had permitted the  funds  rate  to  rise,  Iwould assume banks  would have  tightened  loan terms  and maybe  sold  offsome  assets,  resulting  in  lower bank credit,  lower  money growth,  lessrequired reserves  and, therefore,  less  total  reserves  down the  lineseveral weeks  later.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I hope we  can proceed here with somedispatch.  Mr. Eastburn.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN.  I have  just  an  informational question.  Steve,some  time  ago there  was discussion  about  having  some papers  on  thefunction of  the  discount mechanism,  the  rate  and  so  on.  We now have  anew situation with  the  surcharge  and also  the  likelihood  that we'll bemaking loans  to  other  institutions--in a  couple  of weeks, possibly.In  that  connection,  what are your plans  on  this background material?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I have seen  first drafts  and,  in  somecases  second drafts,  of  a  sizable number  of papers.  Of  course,  theBoard's  decisions  have  in  a sense  "prejudiced" some  of  theconclusions.  [Secretary's note:  These  decisions  involving specialreserve and  other measures were made in  conjunction with thePresident's  anti-inflation program announced on March  14,  1980.]  Wewere proceeding with  our  study  and the  analysis  on  a  schedule  that  gotinterrupted because  of  other work.  We  were trying  to  get  somematerials before  the Committee  at  this  meeting.  Whether we  can do  soat  the next meeting  or  if  it  will  be  after  that  I am not  certain,  inview  of what  is  going  on.  But we are  on  course.  We weren't  includingemergency borrowing  in  that  study because  that  is  taken  care  of  inother ways.  This  was  really a  study of  how  the discount window mightbest  interact with the present  reserve  [supplying]  methods.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Winn.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  Peter,  on  the  unsuccessful unwinding of  some  ofthese GNMA futures  with  the  failure  of  a  firm or  two:  Do you  see  anymore problems  ahead  on that  score with  [more  of  those marketinstruments]  reaching maturity?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  In  a way, I have been  surprised, given  theextent  of  rate  moves  in  the market,  that  there  haven't  been moreproblems  cropping up in  the  GNMA area.  It may be  that  they had  enoughof  a scare  last  October when  there were  fears  of  problems  in  the GNMAhas  been  curtailed  in  those GNMA  futures.  Some  of  the  regulators  havegotten  after  their  constituents--the S&Ls  and  credit  unions  and  banksto  some  degree--to warn them  about undertaking  investment  activitiesthat may not  be  suitable  to  their investment  objectives.  But,  at  thesame  time,  I can't  rule out  the  possibility that  some  of  thoseproblems  could  crop up  again.  I don't  have  a  sense  of  any pendingdisaster  there,  but  there  could be  some  more  [unintelligible].3/18/80-16-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me  just  say  on  these questions  ondiscount rates--I  didn't hear  the  last  answer Mr. Axilrod gave--that  Iam not  sure  it makes  a great  deal  of  difference whether we  move thediscount rate  or not,  except  for  its  signalling  influence, which mighthave  been considerable.  That's because we  could adjust  theborrowings, presumably, to  achieve the  same result.  The  reason thediscount  rate was  not moved--let's be  clear  about  it--is  that we werewaiting  for this  program,  and  it  seemed  inappropriate  to  raise  thediscount  rate when  the Administration was  trying  to negotiate  thesepending  changes.  The judgment was  either right  or  wrong;  but  it was  ajudgment we made.  It  certainly would have been disruptive to  thatprocess  if  the  discount  rate had been raised in the  middle  of  it  whenwe  said we'd have a coordinated announcement.  Mr. Kichline.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without objection  they are  ratified.  Mr.Kichline next  and  then  I think we  will  go  straight  to Mr. Axilrod.  Wecan  then have  the  Committee discussion  in which  I would  like to  get  asmuch  flavor as  you propose to  give in  the  limited time we have  of whatis  going  on out  there  in  the  financial markets  and  in  the bankingsystem.  We  get  all  sorts  of  complaints  about  the  availability of  farmcredit  or small  business credit  or mortgage credit.  It  is very hardto judge,  I think,  [the  degree]  of  total  restraint we have and  thekinds  of  problems,  institutional  and otherwise,  that  are arising.  Themore  flavor on  that we  can have,  the  better.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Axilrod.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  In connection with that  distinction--thewillingness or need of  banks  to  borrow at  the discount  window--I  thinkit  is  important that  we all  reiterate publicly or  otherwise the  factthat  this  change  in  the discount rate  procedures does  not imply  anygreater willingness  on  our part  to  tolerate borrowing.  I think yourdiscount  officers  ought  to make  that  point  to borrowing banks  ratherexplicitly.  We  don't  know how  they will  react.  One  can argue  iteither way.  But  any  tendency for  them to  think  that  the window isopen because  the  rate,  at  least  the  surcharge,  is  closer to  the marketrate,  should be  discouraged or  we will  get  a perverse reaction fromthis  action.  I think a little more  than  usual  calling  to  borrowingbanks may be  justified under  the  circumstances  to point  out  to  themrather  directly that  this  is  no invitation  to borrow.Let  me just  say in connection with setting  the  stage  herethat  the  Chase Manhattan Bank  said  it  is  raising its  prime rate  to  193/18/80-17-percent  today.  At  the  same  time  it  is  instituting  a small  businessbase rate which  remains  at  18-1/4  percent, effective  immediately.They used  some  language  [in  their announcement]  indicating that  theythink this  is  consistent with  the  philosophy of  [the  measures]announced by the  Federal  Reserve.  They  said  they  have  some  special[concern]  for  small  businesses and  they're  acting to  ease  the  strainsthat  small  companies  face  in  borrowing money.  The  special  rateapplies  to  companies with  assets of  $1-1/2  million  or below and bankloans  of  $1/2  million or  below.  With total  bank  loans  of  $1/2million,  that  implies that  a company  is  borrowing one-third of  itstotal  assets.  The bank  said the  small  business rate would apply  toseveral  thousand of  its  smaller customers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  can have  a general  go-around withcomments.  But  apart  from the general  business  situation, any commentsthat you have  about how  far  this  restraint has  gone  and how  far  itneeds to  go  and what  the  special  problems  are,  as  I said, would bevery welcome.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  May I ask  Steve  a couple  of  questions  first?Steve,  I'm a little confused about  the  relationship between M2  and theother aggregates  [in  the  Bluebook alternatives].  First  of  all  let meask this  question:  Is  the relationship  between  the new M2  and GNPpretty similar  to  the  relationship between  the  old M2  and GNP  thatpeople  often  looked at?  I'll  get  that  answer  first.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  My memory  is  that we have  ended up with asomewhat  better relationship.  I had better not answer;  my memory is  alittle  off  on  that.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  For  the  second more important  question,  let'slook  at  alternative B.  The  implied rates of  growth for  February torates  for December  to  June, but  the  growth rate  for M2  has  only beenlowered by 3/4  point  from 7-3/4  to  7 percent.  Now, given the  newactions, with the  likely  impact  on money market  funds,  are we  to[understand]  that  you  believe  there will be  strong growth  in MMCs and2-1/2  year  certificates?  How  do you get  that  strong--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It may turn out  that we  seriouslyunderestimated the  growth  that  would occur  in money market  funds  overthe  first  two months of  the year.  So  there was  a much biggerexpansion  in M2  than  the  Committee,  in effect,  wanted at  that  time.We  have assumed that  growth  in money market  funds  would drop from hereon  to  a rate  just  slightly above what it was  late  last year.  However,that was without  taking into  account  the  latest  15  percent marginalreserve requirement  on  those funds.  Taking that  into  account, wewould think  that  their growth would continue but  at  a much slower3/18/80-18-rate.  Using  a rule  of  thumb  that Governor  Partee  introduced to  thestaff many years  ago--and it's  been difficult  to  find  a  [better]  one--I would  say that  something like  50  percent  of  that money would go  intoM2  type deposits  and another  50  percent  would go  into  large  CDs  andTreasury bills  that  are not  in M2  but  are  either  in M3  or  liquidassets.  I don't  think  that's  too  bad a view because roughly  50percent of  the  liabilities of  funds  are  due  to  institutions  andanother  50  percent  to  individuals.  So  I would expect  that,  ifanything, the 7 percent  M2  figure you are  referring to  may be  a shadestronger than might develop  in  light  of  the program.  But  I wouldn'texpect the  difference  to be  large.  That's  as  far  as  we've been  ableto  go  [in  our analysis].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  I understand  these  inter-relationshipscorrectly, the  December-to-June figure  you show has  a monthly base,but  if  it  were on  a quarterly base  the way  the yearly  target  is,  theimplied 4th  quarter  to  2nd quarter  figure  for M-1A in  alternative  B,for  instance,  would be  5-1/4  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's right.  Those  rates are  on--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  somewhat  above  the midpoint  [of  ourlong-term range].

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's correct.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And even  alternative  C is  above  themidpoint.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Slightly,  that's  right.  That would be 5percent, just given the way  the quarterly averages work out  relativeto  these monthly patterns.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Steve,  even with alternative C, growthwould end up  in  the  second quarter  as  a whole  running  slightly abovethe middle  of  our range.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  But well  within the  range.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well  within, but above  the middle of  it.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That  assumes  a very  strong April,  so we get  theIf  it  didn't work out  that way, itmoney in early  in  the  [quarter]. would be a little  lower,  I would think.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well, the  April growth  rate  is  only  8 percent  inalternative  C.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I mean  it  is  strong relative to  the  othermonths.  But  if  [that  pattern were]  reversed,  it  would lower  thequarterly average growth.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Eastburn.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN.  Just  a quick  technical  question.  It  seems  tome  that  April  is  rather  critical  to  the decision we make today  and Iam trying  to  get  a fix on your  feeling about  the probability of  those3/18/80-19-numbers.  Your estimates  and  the  New York staff's  estimates,  I gather,are  somewhat different  on  this.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I think  the  direction is  the  same;  it's  themagnitudes  that  are  different.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  New York has  a  stronger  estimate  for  April,partly because  of  the  tax refunds.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN.  It's  quite  a bit  stronger,  isn't  it?  Is  thatthe  basis  for  the  strong April  in  both cases?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  We did not  put  in  any  specific  estimate  for  taxrefunds because we  haven't  observed  them having an  effect  yet  in  lateadd  only a couple  of  percentage points,  roughly.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN.  And New York has  them in?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Yes,  that's  part  of  the  difference;  I reallydon't  know if  that's  the whole  difference.

[SECTION]

MR.  TIMLEN.  But  [the  difference]  is  very substantial,  Peter,in April.  Dave, New York's  [estimate]  is  about twice  what  the--

[SECTION]

MR.  EASTBURN.  Yes,  there's  a very big difference.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  The  overall  difference  is  about  8 percentagepoints but my  impression was  that  the  tax  refunds  accounted  for about3 or  4 percentage points  of  that.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN.  Steve,  could you say  anything about  yourfeeling  of  confidence  in  that?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I was  hoping not  to.  I consider  this  asreasonable  an  estimate as  a group  of  human beings  working  togethermight come  to.  I didn't  give you  the  specifics, but  it  assumesroughly  a $1 billion  increase  in M1  in  the week of  the  19th, which  isthe week we're  in, another  $2-1/2  billion  in  the  week of  the  26th,  andthen very  little  increase thereafter.  But  that  gives  us  a high Aprilfigure because  from February  to  the end of March M1  will haveincreased  12  percent,  roughly, and  that  gets  into  the  April  figure.  Iwouldn't  doubt, given our GNP projections,  that we're  going to  have  asecond-quarter rate  of  growth close  to what we've estimated here  onaverage,  something  like  4-3/4  percent.  Whether it's  going  to  comewith  a large  April  or  a large May  or  a large  June,  or whether  it  willbe  an even distribution among  those months,  I really can't  be verycertain.  It  would be misleading  to  say that  I feel  extremely certainabout  this;  I don't.  But  I don't  think  it's  unreasonable.  It  wouldbe  what  a reasonable  set  of  people would  come  to  at  this  point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  it's  fair  to  say,  in  the light  ofhistory,  that  there  is no  feeling of  certainty about  any of  thesenumbers.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  It's my understanding that  a refund will  feeddirectly into  the money supply.  Is  that  right?3/18/80-20-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  there  will be  checks  received byconsumers.  The  uncertainty is what people will  do  with them.  Willthey deposit  them directly  in  their  savings  and  time  accounts--inwhich case  it  will  go  into M2--or will  they put  them  in  their  demandaccounts?  And if  they put  them in demand accounts, will  they holdthem  for one  or  two days?  In  that  case  it will have  some  effect onM1  but  a very small  one.  That  is  the  reasoning  [underlying  ourestimate].  If  people put  the  funds  into demand accounts, we wouldn'texpect  them  to  stay there  long.  Why would people want  to hold moredemand deposits?  So,  they would either transfer  the  funds  to  anotherasset,  such  as  a money market  fund or  a T-bill  or  something, or  startspending them.  In that  case,  any  little upward effect would begincoming down  in May and June  and July.  The only  evidence  we've  reallyhad was  on  the  tax  rebate program where checks were  sent  out  to  peopleas  a tax rebate;  those very  clearly had a discernable money supplyeffect.  On  these  kinds  of  refunds,  we  don't have  the  experience thatwould enable us  to  be  very certain about  [the  effect].  So,  we  arewaiting  for  something  to  happen;  we haven't seen  it  yet  and we may notsee  it  this  whole--

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Well,  suppose  the  refund is  real  and it  occurs.Is  that enough  to  knock us  off  of  our  money path growth?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  as  we  said  last  time  and this  time  also,we think  the  effect in  the  three months of  March, April,  and May mightbe on the  order  of  1 to  3 percentage points  [unintelligible]  and  thenunwinding to  that  extent  in  June  and July and piddling out  in August.That's  our estimate  of  what might happen.  But we haven't  deliberatelyput  that  in.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You have  a big  seasonal  in  April  to  takecare  of  this  in a normal way?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  but the  refunds  this year  are estimated  tobe about  $12  billion  above  the  average  of  the  last  two  or  three years.So  it's more  than normal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  is  the  normal?

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  They  are estimating about  $46  billion, I think,so  $33  billion  or  so must be normal.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I don't remember  the  exact number.  I don'tknow whether Darwin  [Beck]  has  it.  Well,  this year we're  estimatingthe  individual  tax refunds  to  be  somewhere  on  the  order of  $48billion.  In  1979,  total  refunds were  $36 billion.  Reading back, inrecent  years  they were,  in billions  of  dollars,  36,  34,  31,  and 29.So you  can see  that it's  a quantum jump this  year  on  the  order  of  $12billion.  In March  of  the previous  four  years  the  refunds were  around$9-1/2  to  $10  billion;  this  year  they will be  around  $13.7  billion,according  to  these  estimates.  So  it's  a jump  of  $4 billion  in Marchand roughly  $3 to  $4 billion in April.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Who would  like  to  make  some  generalcomments?

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES.  I would  just  like  to  respond to  the  one questionyou raised about  farm credit.3/18/80-21-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  respond more generally,  too.

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES.  We have  recently done  a  survey  of  our countrybanks  and  they tell  us  they are  as  tight  as  a  drum,  and the  farmerstell  us  [the banks]  are  as  tight  as  a drum.  Yet  we  have very few ofthe  country  banks  trying  to pass  on those  loans  to  the  city banks,which  are not  tight  as  a drum.  When we  get  behind that,  [we  findthat]  they're passing them  off  like  crazy  to  the  PCAs  and  so  on,  butthey're  reluctant  to  pass  them off  to  their  city  correspondents  simplybecause  the  price  is  so  high.  So  it's  not  really a  question ofavailability  in the  normal  sense,  but a question  of  theirunwillingness  at  least  to  this point  to  try  to pass  those higher  rateson  to  their  farm  customers  who are used  to  substantially lower  rates.Now,  I don't  like  the  implication  of  that,  in  terms  of  the  directionwe  seem to be  going,  which  is  to  give  preference  to  small  businesses.But  I  think  that  is  the  real  issue in  their mind.  It's  not  that  themoney  is  not  there;  it's  just  that  they're  unwilling, so  far  at  least,to  contract  for  the  higher price.The  only  other  comment  I would make  is  that,  like manyothers,  I was  disappointed in  the movement  in  the  President's programfor  fiscal  1980.  That puts  a  little  extra  burden on  [monetary policy]for  this year.  Therefore,  to  the  extent  that we  do  err,  I think we'regoing  to  have  to  err  on  the  tighter  side  rather  than  the easier  side.For  fiscal  1981,  I  favor  the  reverse  of  that.  If  the  deficit  infiscal  1980  is  around  $35  to  $40  billion  and  then  in  fact  [the  budget]really  does  get balanced in  fiscal  1981,  that's  a  $35  to  $40  billion[swing]  in one year.  That  strikes me  as  a little  larger than we'venormally  accommodated and unnecessarily runs  the  risk of  aggravatingwhatever recession  we're in.  It's  too bad  [the  effects]  weren'tevened  out  a  little, with a  little more  in  '80  and  a little  less  in'81.  I think  that  has  implications  for us  in terms  of  how hard wepress  during  the next  few months.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  On a  cash basis,  isn't  the budget going  to bein  some  surplus  between April  1 and  the  end  of  the year?

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes, but  it  normally has  a big  seasonal.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I understand that,  but  just  on a  cash basis--

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.  May I piggyback on Mark's  comments  for a minute?On your  agriculture point, Mark, I wasn't  sure  I followed you.  Is  itthat  the  banks  are not  making loans  at  close  to  the prime  rate  but  arefalling  further  below?  Is  that what  you're  saying?

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES.  Well,  the country  banks have  loaned out  abouteverything they have.  But  typically, now, given  the  current primerate,  the  loans  are  at  below prime,  and  they're reluctant  to passthose  on  to  the  city banks.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.  Well,  the  city banks won't buy  them except  at  adiscount--

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES.  That's  right.3/18/80-22-

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.  --is  what you're  saying.  We  have that  sameexperience,  and the  banks  in our  area  are very  tight.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  country banks?

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.  Yes,  the  country banks.  There  is  some  complaint,too,  on  the  way the  Farm Credit Agency  credits  enter  into  this.  Someof  that  is  not  credit  we're  trying to  discourage,  like  Farmers HomeAdministration per  se.  The more  Farmers  Home Administration does,  theless  of  that  type  of  credit  the  commercial  banks  will  do,  and they arerestive  about  that  even  though they  are  tight.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Morris.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Mr. Chairman, our  staff  has  about  the  sameeconomic  forecast as  the  Board's  staff.  I have  a gut  feeling that  ifthe  forecast  is  wrong, the  result is  likely to  be a deeper  recession.I am thinking primarily in  terms  of  the  financial  strains  that  thesystem will  be  under.  I think we've  all  been  amazed at  thewillingness  of  consumers  and businessmen to  take  on  loans  at extremelyhigh  rates.  And it  seems  to  me  the  counterpart  of  this  is  that we maygo  into  a recession  [with]  an awful  lot  of  strains that  are  likely  tolead  to  a deeper recession.  One  sector in particular that  is  showinggreat  strains  even  in a forward moving  economy  is  the savings  banks;the  situation  in New England is  getting  critical.  I was  a littleshocked yesterday to  find out  that  they may be  in  a position to  haveordinary access  to  the  discount window within as  little  as  two weeks.If  that's  the  case, we have  an awful  lot  of  issues  to  resolve.  As  youknow,  in the  past we  have not  loaned to  organizations  that  wereclearly insolvent.  The  fact  is  that  all  the  savings banks  in NewEngland probably are  insolvent  if  their  assets  are valued at  current

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That's  true  of  many banks,  too.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  It's  true  of  banks,  too,  but  it's much more thecase with  the  savings  banks, particularly  in New England where theaverage yield on  their portfolios  is  very much  lower than  on the WestCoast.  That's because  (a) we've been a slow growing region;  and  (b)New Englanders  don't  change  their houses  as  frequently as  people  inCalifornia do.  That has  led to  a very  old and very low yieldingportfolio.  So,  not  only do  they have  liquidity problems but  they havevery serious  earnings  problems.  Most  of  the  savings banks  in NewEngland will probably show  a deficit  in  earnings  this year.  There areother  complications.  There  is  this  new dual  rate which was  set  up  todeal with  large  commercial banks.  I think that  is perfectly  fine,  inlight  of  the  fact  that  that's  where  the growth  of credit  has been mostpronounced.  But  some  of  the most seriously troubled savings banks  inNew England have assets  in  excess of  $500  million.  And  the  questionis:  Do  we want  to  charge  them the premium rate?  Another  problem isthat most of  the  savings banks  in New England are not  insured by theFDIC.  We  have  a state  fund which amounts  to  about  $250  million.  Whatdo  we do  when  that  fund  is  approaching its  limits?  We're  going  tohave  an awful  lot  of  issues  in this  whole area  of  lending  to  thriftinstitutions  coming down on  us  very soon  that will  need to  beaddressed.3/18/80-23-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  do you  conclude  from all  this  for  ourcurrent  posture?  Tighter,  easier,  unchanged?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  I think our  current  posture  is  doing thejob.  I would advocate  the  alternative  B  approach.  I don't  see  wherethe  situation now requires  a  tighter  posture.  We  have  to  evaluatewhat  needs  to  be  done.  And I think we're going  to  see,  as  the  staffis  forecasting,  a major  collapse  in housing  in  the  next  few months.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Timlen.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  Mr. Chairman,  I haven't  talked  to  [any businesscontacts]  since  Friday, except  to  that  group of  bankers who  were hereyesterday.  But  I must  say that  through Thursday  of  last week,businessmen,  and by  that  I mean mostly  industrialists, were  stilltelling us  in New York  that  they have  great  confidence  in  1980  being  apretty good year--maybe  not  a record year but  a pretty  good year.It's  true  that  the  money market  banks  and  the medium  size  and  largeregional banks  have  all  been approached  for,  and have  granted,  loancommitments.  And I know a few  of  them are  very uncomfortable aboutmeeting those  commitments.  In  upstate New York  some of  the  countrybanks  have been  expressing a great  deal  of  concern  about  the  effect  ofthe  current  level  of  interest  rates  on  local  small  businessmen.  Ithink  local  small businessmen  are not unlike  the  farmers  in  theMidwest.  There are  stories  that  automobile  dealers  are  just closingtheir businesses  because  they  can't  finance  their  inventories;  ratherthan go bankrupt,  they retire.  We have  the impression  thatinventories  are generally modest, although  for  some  small  retailersthey are  pretty minimal.  I have  the  impression  that  in New York Cityretail  sales  are pretty  good, but  that may not  be  the  case  outside  ofthe  city.  We've had  some  indications  that  in  the  first  two months  ofthe  year  there  have been price  increases, particularly by the  largegrocery  chains.  Some  people explain that  as  the  reason  for  all  thecoupons we're getting  in  our Sunday newspapers.  In effect,  it'sgiving  back the anticipatory price  increase.We also have  in  our area  the  same grave  concerns  that  Frankhas  in Massachusetts  and New England generally.  Our  thrifts  are  invery bad shape.  Three  of  the  ten  largest mutual  savings  banks  in NewYork were  in  the  red for  1979,  and probably more will  be  in  the  redfor  1980.  It  is  disintermediation on  the  one  side  and  terribleearnings  on the  other  side.  My  own  feeling  is  that  if  the  consumerhadn't  been running  out  of  gas  before  last Friday, he certainly hashad his  accelerator  taken away  from him  as  of  Friday.  On the  otherhand, though, we're hearing that  some  companies  are  accelerating thetiming  of  their  annual wage  increases.  For example,  if  an annualreview was  to  be  in July or  August,  they're  bringing it  forward.  Sothe  consumer may have  a  little  extra money  in  his pocket.  The  Boardstaff's projections  of  the  outlook  for the  next  15  months  seem prettyreasonable.  In  all  the  circumstances, my thought  is  that  we  shouldhang  in  there, which  is  probably what  "B" does.  That would be  my ideaof  hanging  in  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Forrestal,  what wisdom do you  bring usfrom Atlanta  in your  first presence here?  Welcome.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Thank you, sir.  It's  nice  to  be here  at  thisinteresting  time.  Shifting  to  another part  of  the  country, Mr.3/18/80-24-Chairman,  the  Atlanta District  shows  a remarkable reversal  inattitudes  concerning  the economic  outlook,  it  seems  to me.  Just amonth  ago  our directors  and businessmen generally were  virtuallydiscounting  any recession, even  a mild  one this  year.  But  in amonth's  time  that  sentiment has  changed remarkably,  as  I say.  Theynow almost uniformly  see a recession developing  and perhaps  a deeperrecession  developing later this  year.  That  even comes  from our  SouthFlorida  directors  who had been reporting  very, very bullish  conditionsright  through  last  Friday.  These  sentiments,  of  course,  were voicedbefore  the  President's program and  the  Federal Reserve program.  It'sinteresting  to  note  that  this  change  is  attitudinal  and not based  onany real  change  in  basic economic  conditions.  Conditions  in  theDistrict generally are  about  the  same  as  they were, although, ofcourse, we  have had  some softness  in real  estate  sales  andconstruction  activity  and a slowing  in  retail  sales.  That has  beenreflected,  too,  in  a less  rapid run-up  in bank credit  than  in  otherparts  of  the  country.  But  the  perception of  the  future  is  that  we'rein  for  a very difficult  time.  Our business people  and directors seeautomobile dealers,  farmers,  small  business people,  and thrifts  beinghurt  pretty badly and  I think there  is  a real  fear  at  this point  of  acredit  crunch coming  along.  While  I don't  have any data, and my  staffhasn't given me any data  about  small  banks,  I have  an  intuitivefeeling that  some of  the  small  banks  in  the  District are probably  inmuch the  same condition  as  savings  and loans,  although perhaps  not  tothe  same degree.  My personal  feeling, after hearing  all  of  this  frompeople  around the  District,  is  that  the pessimism  is perhaps  a littleoverdone.  Recession, in my  judgment, would not be all  that bad if  weare  going  to  get prices under  control.In  terms  of policy,  it  seems  to me that we've  got  to  get  themonetary aggregates  under control.  February was perhaps  a one-monthaberration, but  there  was a run-up  in  the aggregates.  That,  togetherwith negative market  reaction to  the  President's  program, is  reallygoing  to  fuel  inflationary  expectations.  Indeed, as  has  been remarkedhere, with energy costs  increasing in  the  short  term we could have  anincrease  in  inflation.  That  is  bound to  cause consumers  to  lackconfidence  in what  has  been done  by the Administration,  and we  couldhave  an  increase  in  inflationary expectations with the  obviousresults.  So my judgment,  Mr. Chairman, which  is  a little  differentfrom the  staff's at  the Atlanta  Bank,  is  to  err on  the  side of  greaterrestraint.  While  alternative  B seems  to me a viable  alternative,whereas  I would not  consider  alternative A to  be  viable, my preferencewould be  to  go  for  something along the  lines of  alternative C todemonstrate  in  the near  term  to  the markets  that we're going  tocontinue with this  program of  restraint.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Black.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman, we  are  in general  agreement withwhat  the  staff has  [projected].  If  we  were to  shade  it  a little,  we'dshade  it  along the  lines  that  Frank Morris  described because  of  theunrest we  see  in  financial markets,  along with weaker  housing and  alsoprobably weakness in  investment,  all  of which we think may be morethan  the  staff  is  estimating.  I would add one  other caveat  and thatis  the  feeling on  our  part  that  the  international  situation may beweaker  than  is  generally being assumed.  So  we would shade  theforecast  toward a little  deeper decline  than the  staff  has  indicated.By the  same  token,  we would expect  perhaps  a more rapid recovery.  The3/18/80-25-staff  is  actually  showing no  growth  in  real  GNP between  the  fourthquarter  of  '80  and the  fourth quarter  of  '81,  and we  think  [GNPgrowth]  will probably be  positive.On  the  policy side,  it  seems  to me  that  the  best  thing wecould do  is  to  continue  the policy we've  been following.  I think yousaid  it  all,  and very well, yesterday before  those bankers when youstressed that  the  backbone of  our policy still  remains  our efforts  tocontrol  the  aggregates.  Not  everyone  heard you yesterday;  there  maybe  some general  doubt that  we'll  do  that  and some  expectation thatwe'll  back away.  So,  one  could make a case  for  going with alternativeC.  But  it  seems  to me  that  alternative B is  strong  enough  tounderscore  our  determination.  The  rates  of  growth in  the  aggregatesfor  the  last part  of  that  six-month period are  substantially belowwhat  we actually had  in  the  first  three months,  or  think we had in  thefirst  three  months.  They are  below  our  targets,  so  "B" seems  to us  tobe  the best  of  the  alternatives.So  far  as  the  federal  funds  range  is  concerned,  I wouldprefer  to  drop the  top and also  the  bottom of  that  range.  I think weare  now to  the point where we  can do  that.  I would not want  to  raisethe  lower  end, a possible alternative  suggested in  the  Bluebook,  sinceI would like us  to  be  in a position to  let  rates  come down prettyfast,  if  they do  tend to  do  that  in the  face of  a controlled set  ofgrowth rates  in  the  aggregates.  I am  sure that  the  Committee  is  notgoing  to  agree  to  abandoning that  range;  against  that  background,11-1/2  to  18  percent  looks  about right  to  us.

Mr.  Chairman, the  crosscurrents  are  so extremethat  it's  difficult to  sort  them out  and get a fix, particularly withlast  weekend's  adjustments  not being  factored into many people'sthinking.  Three or  four  things,  I think, are  interesting.  One  isthat  we  turned off  commercial  construction--that  is,  apartment  houses,office buildings,  and so  forth--completely in  October, and it  turnedback on  in  an unbelievable fashion  in  January and  early February.We've  turned  it  off  again, I think, really in  the  last  couple ofweeks;  there are  just  no deals being made.  But the profits picturethat  is  coming  through on  the deals  that  have been made are so  unrealthat  it's  almost unbelievable.  With the  acceleration  of  rents andwith  [builders']  fixed costs  not moving up, the  flows  back to  profitsare very, very high.  That's  particularly true  where  tax  reliefoccurred, in  California and Texas  and places  like  that.  In  spite  ofincreased operating expenses  the profits  picture  is  almostunbelievable.  So,  if  we get  any stability  in  [interest  rates],  myguess  is  that  those  [activities]  will  explode  on  us  again  as buildingpicks up.The  second thing  I'd  report  is  that  the major chemicalcompanies  are showing  profits  in  the  first months  of  the year,  andI've seen  figures  for month-to-month developments.  While  these areworldwide operations  and one  can't  sort  it  out  [for  individualcountries],  it was  interesting  to me  that  the price  increases  fromNow, I don't  know how the  price  increases  were divided up worldwide,but  these  are pretty  substantial price  changes.  They have  those[changes]  built  right  into  June--this was  before  last  Friday--so3/18/80-26-there's  a big move  in  some  of  these  factors.  And their  earnings  areunbelievable.While  building has  phased down and  the  automobile  industry  isstaying  a bit  soft,  [businesses]  in  our area  are  reportingunbelievable  orders  and profits  expectations.  Our  railroad people  arereporting really quite good operating  results,  much better than  theyhad projected.  And this  is  across  the  line,  [even]  with  the  downwardpush occurring  in  their  automobile business.  Our banks  are  showing amixed picture.  Many of  them are pretty well  loaned up  and are  notseeing too much demand because  of rates  in agriculture  and some  otherareas.  On the  other hand,  they are  not  seeing any problem withrespect  to  delinquencies  or  slow pays  or  any of  the normal  [signs]  onesees  on  that  score.  We had, of  course,  in  the last  couple of  weeksthis  tremendous  drive  to  increase commitments.  Their  customers  weretold that  lines  of  credit wouldn't be honored and they had to  convertthose  into  revolving notes.  So  there  was  a tremendous  scramble  tooffset  the  anticipated  [government credit]  control  system by  suchthings  as price  increases  and wage  increases  and  also  by an explosion,really,  in  lines  of  credit.  They were  taking  to  their boards  demandsfor  loans  that  were  5 to  6 times  their normally weekly increase.We really  don't  know what  the  outlook  is  because we don'tknow how people will  adjust;  it's  a crude guess  that we're making.  Inview of  your statement yesterday and other  concerns,  I am veryconcerned about  the  [potential]  April  bulge, which could be muchlarger  than  is  shown here.  And unless we  react  to  that,  our  owncredibility  is  going to  be  questioned even  though  [we  expect the bulgeto  unwind].  We  can't  say  "Oh well,  it's  going  to go  down  in May andrespond  to  current  developments.  While  the  targets  of  "B" seem  to  meappropriate,  in  order to make  those  targets  I'd  like  to  raise  thatfunds  rate range  by 2 points,  let's  say,  to  13-1/2  to  20  percent,  togive  the  Desk  [the  flexibility  to respond],  if  necessary,  if we  getthis  kind of  bulge.  I don't want  to  raise  it  just  to  raise  it.  Butunless  we respond  to  the  increase, which could be  quite  large  in thisperiod, we're going to  have  a real  credibility problem.I am  impressed with those who watch  the Desk.  They will  tellyou  exactly what  the intervention points were;  they  don't  see  anychange in  terms  of  our  intervention points  which  [they  say areapparent]  to  the market.  People,  in  spite of  all  the changes,  arereading  [our  operations]  as  if  we were  operating under  the  oldguidelines.  While  their perceptions  are wrong,  they still  areperceptions;  and we're dealing with perceptions  as  people  interpretwhat we're  doing and how  they will  react.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We're  certainly not  dealing  in  eighths  anymore.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  I know, but  it's  amazing to me  that  they  can tellyou what hour we  intervened and at  what rate.  That  hasn't  changed.But  I am really concerned about  this April  bulge and how it will  beinterpreted.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  At  times  like  this,  Mr.  Chairman, regionaldifferences  do  show up rather  starkly.  West  of  the Rockies  there  are3/18/80-27-precious  few  signs  of  any present  or  impending recession, particularlyas  our  directors view  [the  situation].  With the  obvious  exception  ofhousing and  autos,  things  seem  to  be moving along  at  a very  rapidrate.  There  is  continued strength  in  consumer spending;  it's  almosthard  to believe.  I believe much  of  that  still  reflects a  "buy it  nowbefore  it  gets more  expensive" approach.  Labor  demand  in  defense-related  industries and  high technology industries  such  as  electronicsand  aerospace  is  contributing  to  continued strength  in  employment  inthe  District.  Loan demand remains  strong at banks  and, despite  therecent  flooding  in California, agriculture  all  around  the West  seemsto  be  in pretty good shape.  I think the  difference  between West ofthe  Rockies  and what Mark was reporting  probably  stems  from  thepredominance  of  large branch systems  around the West.  I know that  inCalifornia  our  three  largest  banks are  among the  three largestagricultural  lenders  anywhere  in the  country.  And, of  course,  a goodpart  of  that  lending is  to  agri-business, but  they take  reasonablygood  care  of  the  smaller farmers  as  well--to the  extent  that we havesome  of  those  around the West,  and we do.  Demand for  lumber you'dthink would be  falling  out  of  bed because  of  housing, and yet  exportsto  the  Pacific  Basin area have made  up a good part  of  that.  So,  inshort, while  this may not be  applicable  to  the  national scene,  ourdirectors  just don't  see  any signs  of  recession in  our part  of  thecountry nor  do  they believe  one is  ahead  for the  regional  economy.With  regard to  the national  scene,  it's  obviously a different picture.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Your area  covers a not  insignificant  partof  the national  scene.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  True.  Well,  with regard to  the  Bluebookalternatives,  I can't really  add much  to  what has  already been  said.All  things  considered,  I would agree with much of  what Willis Winnmentioned:  One  more month  like  February and our  credibility is  goingto  be  in bad shape.  We  recently had the  first  of  the  ABA/FRBseminars, which originally was supposed to  cover  the  subject  ofregulation under  that plan  that you encouraged us  to  get  into.  Wehad,  I thought,  a very good meeting.  We  had a number of  people  fromthe  Board as  principal  speakers,  some  of  the division directors  andalso  Governor Wallich as  a principal  speaker on monetary policy.  Wegot  quite  a bit  of  flak as  I remember, Henry.  There was quite  a bitof  skepticism expressed  in  that  audience about whether we were  goingto  stick to  our announced  target of  ongoing restraint because  of  whatthose  February numbers were  showing--and  they were aware  of  them bythen--on  the money supply.  Another month like that  would reallyundermine  our  credibility a great deal,  so  I share Willis'  view aboutdoing  something  about  the April bulge  if  we  can.  And I think weprobably should.  In  general,  however,  I would go  along with  the  specsin alternative B.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think we ought  to  have a coffee breaknow, but let's  make it  short.[Coffee  break]

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN.  I have  to  address myself  to  conditions beforelast  Friday.  At  that  time businessmen  in our  area were  generallyfeeling pretty good about  current business, but  I suspect  that'schanging.  My own  guess  is  that  we  are  going to  have  a recession of  atleast  the magnitude  of  the  Greenbook projections  and perhaps  deeper.3/18/80-28-In view of  that, my inclination was  to  go with  alternative  B.  Buthaving  listened to  Steve about  the April  bulge,  I do  have  a concernabout  that,  which  tilts me  toward  "C." going with  "B" and watching  closely to  see  what happens  and movinglater on  in  the period or  of  striking  a halfway point between  "B" and"C."  That's  about  where  I would  come  out  at  the present  time.Perhaps  there  is  some way of

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Do we  have  the  technical  capability ofoffsetting that  refund?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  there  is  some  funds  rate  that would doit.  But  I would quickly mention  that  there  is  no  certainty  that  [theprojected]  bulge  is  going  to  appear.  We  took  5 percentage points  outof  the  seasonal  factor  this year  relative to  last year;  andcumulatively that  seasonal  factor has  been adjusted over  the past twoor  three years  to  take  15  percentage  points  at  an  annual  rate  out  ofto appear.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN.  I am  interpreting this  as  the  best estimate  onthe part  of  reasonable people of  what's  going  to happen.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Exactly.  I just want  to  be  covered both ways.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  If  you look at  page  7  [of  the  Bluebook],  Dave,which shows  the monthly profile:  In  alternative B,  for  example,  Aprilhas  a growth rate  of  8.6  percent  for  M-1A and May has  two  dashes,which I assume means  0, and June has  2.8  percent growth.  Somethingcould be  taken  out  of  April  and put  it  into May as  far  as  the path  isconcerned.

[SECTION]

MR. EASTBURN.  Yes.  I am sure  that  is  true.  And in  ordinaryconditions,  I wouldn't care.  We  could certainly tolerate  thesenumbers.  But  the point,  which has already been made,  is  that thecredibility  of  the  System in that  short  period of  time--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  My point was  simply that  we wouldn't necessarilyhave  to  move  to alternative  C;  we could change  the profile  ofalternative B.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The agriculturalsector has  been reasonably well  covered  in  the  comments made by MarkWilles and Bob Mayo.  Our banks  supplying  credit  to  the  agriculturalsector are very tight with respect  to  loan/deposit ratios.  Butcontrary to what  Mark suggested, we  have  found that  the  country banksare  facing up to  their problem and raising  their  interest rates  toagricultural  borrowers.  They have no  outlet for  the loans  even  atthese higher rates,  however, because  the  correspondent banks are notprepared to pick  them up,  even  at  a discount,  at  the rates  the  creditis  being extended.  [Cattlemen]  are  withdrawing from  filling  thefeedlots  again as  they  turn  their present  stock, which implies  lessmeat  in  the  future  I suppose.  Secondly, as  we  go  into  the plantingseason, a period  of high  agricultural  [loan]  demand, there  is  a bit ofa safety valve,  if  you will.  There  is  still  a lot  of  grain  in  thehands  of  the  producers, which can  be  sold at  the  lower prices  nowprevailing.  That  would suggest  that  there will  be  a considerable3/18/80-29-squeeze  on  farm profits  in  the  period ahead.  But  I don't  think  therestraint  program will  have a great  impact  on the  agricultural  sectorimmediately.  The grain embargo  probably will  have  as  great  an  impactas  the restraint  program. there  are  tough times  ahead  in  the  agricultural  sector.What  I am  really  trying  to  say  is  thatTurning to  policy, Dave  Eastburn captured my concern verywell.  In  the  Bluebook we are  looking  at  a 4-month period instead  ofthe usual  2-month period or even  a quarter.  It  seems  to me  thatcredibility  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System may be  the  more  importantaspect,  at  least  of  near-term policy.  The potential  bulge  in April  ispart of  the  problem.  I'd hate  to  go back  to  the  [procedures used]prior to  October  6 and  focus  on  interest  rates.  But  I think  it'sextremely  important--for  international  and  domestic  reasons,inflationary anticipation, and  other  things--that we not  permit  [thefunds]  rate  to  come  down very  far  in  the next  month or  two.  As  aresult,  "B"  looks  very reasonable  to me.  I would be  inclined to  movea  little closer  to  "C" because  of  the potential  for  interest  ratemovements  if  indeed  the  demand for  money begins  to  ease  somewhatbecause  of  the  lower  projection  of  growth.  And as  I understand  it,the  restraint  program may depress  that  another half  percent  over  theyear.  How that  will  roll  into  the  [next]  two months,  I don't know.So,  "B" would be  reasonable and  I would be  inclined  to move a  littletoward  "C"  if  that were  the  sense  of  the  Committee.  I would also  setthe  federal  funds  range  by raising  the  lower end  and reestablishingthe  4 percent spread,  thus  coming  out with a 14  to  18  percent rangewith  the  anticipation  that  interest rates  would remain  in  the upperhalf  of  that  range for  at  least  the next  60  days.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Roos.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Well,  [Mr.  Guffey and  I] are  both  from Missouri,and my approach to  [policy]  will  underscore  the  great  diversity ofthinking that  occurs  in  the great  state  of Missouri,  Mr.  Chairman.Very briefly, the  general  condition of  the  economy as  we  see  it  is  afairly  level  one with  the  exception  of  the building and  real  estateareas  and automobile  sales  and manufacturing, which are  obviouslyquite weak.  Just  last  week we  had a group  of  savings  and  loan  peoplein  for  lunch,  and they  reported very severe  trouble,  as  your  savingsbank people  are  experiencing, Frank.  Our  agricultural  loan demandcontinues  strong.  Basically, we  haven't  sensed  any  significantweakening  in the  last  few weeks.With regard  to  policy,  I would  favor  alternative  B.  I wouldresist  like  the plague any narrowing of  the  fed  funds  range.  Ifanything,  I would  favor  a widening of  it;  I certainly wouldn't  seekthat, but  I would  oppose  a narrowing of  it.  With regard  to  thismatter of  credibility,  I wonder  if  it  isn't  incumbent  upon all  of  usto go  out  of  our way in  the weeks  and months  ahead to  explain what weare  trying  to  do and  have our  staffs  at  their various  speaking[engagements]  concentrate  on  explaining  it,  too.  I think there  is  ageneral  lack  of  knowledge.  Within  this  room there  is  the  capabilityof  telling  people:  Don't  look  at  the weekly  figures;  don't even  lookat  the monthly  figures.  I don't  think we have  to be  slaves  to  thisproblem of  credibility.  We  should  be missionaries  and  salespeople  tothe  greatest  extent possible  and  explain how we  are trying  to  operatenow.  Anyway, that's  the  gist  of my point  of  view.3/18/80-30-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Mayo.

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would only add on  the agriculturalside  that  I think some  of  the  trauma accompanying  the announcement  ofthe  grain embargo has  subsided.  There  is  a much calmer  approach tothe problem  and a little more  Federal government credibility than[earlier]  in  the  farm community,  although they are  still  somewhatskeptical.  We  are,  of  course,  in a very poor position on  autos andhousing  throughout  our District.  But  capital  goods  are  still  runningquite strong.  This  is  typical  of  what  one  might  call  "this  stage  ofthe  cycle."  I feel more  comfortable  than  I did last month with theGreenbook  [forecast],  yet  I would not be  surprised if  we  got  down to  aminus  5 percent  quarter  [for  GNP]  before  this  forthcoming  recession  isover.  I think we are getting  closer, much  closer,  to  the peaks  thatwe  keep visualizing  and postponing, and we  could easily have  a creditcrunch--though I don't  know how best  to  define  that--perhaps  in  thenext  4 to  6 weeks.Having  said  that,  I would be happy  enough with  "B,"  but  Iwould tilt  also  a little toward  "C,"  agreeing with what Dave  had  tosay.  On the  federal  funds  range,  though,  I would just  leave  the[lower  limit  of]  11-1/2  percent.  It  has no  real  significance now andI wouldn't want  to  see  us  push  that up  at  this point.  It  restrictsour  image  of  flexibility when  it  gets published.  Instead, I wouldjust  go  to  the 20  percent  on  the  up side  and be  done with it,recognizing that  that would give  us  cover  for an  interim period,rather  than have  to  go  back frequently  to  jiggle  it  up another half  orone  percentage point.  I don't  see any  objection  to going  to  the  20percent,  given the rate  structure we have  today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Rice.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Well, Mr. Chairman, generally  I go  along with thestaff  forecast.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  new anti-inflationary programwill have  the  effect of  making  the  coming recession deeper than  itmight have been and might even bring  it  on sooner.  If  I have  anyskepticism  at  all  [about  the Greenbook  forecast],  it's  in  the  area  ofthe  timing  of  the  recession.  The  economy appears  to be  continuingstrong, or  relatively so.  If  I read the  Redbook correctly, most  ofthe businessmen around  the  country report remarkable equanimity  in  theface  of  the  economic  situation;  they just  don't  seem to be  excessivelyconcerned  about--or,  in any case,  feel  confident  that  they can dealwith--whatever is  down  the  road.  It's  pretty difficult  to  findevidence  of weakness  in the  economy aside  from housing  and autos;  onehas  to  look pretty  hard.  One has  to  look behind the  industrialproduction figures  to  see  that  there would have been a decline  inindustrial production had production of  autos  and parts  not  risen.Also one  has  to  note that  capacity utilization  in the  primaryprocessing  industries  and materials-producing  industries  has  declined.And, of  course, the  average workweek has  declined  somewhat.  These  areabout  the  only  signs  I see  of  any emerging weakness.So,  I feel  that our posture  at  the present  time  is  aboutright, with  the appropriate  tautness  in  financial  markets.  I don'tthink alternatives  B and C leave  us much  to choose  between.  Actually,[for M1]  the  difference between  them amounts  to  about  $900  million  atthe  end of June,  and  that doesn't  strike me  as  being very much moneyout  of  the  total money supply.  So,  it  doesn't  really matter too  much3/18/80-31-to me  whether we  choose  alternative B or  C.  If  we  choose alternativeB,  it  appears  that we will  have  a slightly  larger volume  of  moneystarting  in April  and a less  substantial  rate  of  increase  in  the  thirdand  fourth quarters.  On  the  other  hand,  if  we  choose alternative C,we will  have  a lower rate  of  increase in  the  second quarter  and ahigher rate  of  increase  in  the third  and fourth  quarters.  Given thecurrent  situation,  it would seem  to  me better on balance  to  leanharder  in the  second quarter and  increase  the  restraint  then;  thatwill  [show  through]  in  the  third quarter  and allow for  a slightlyhigher rate  of  increase  in  those quarters  when we expect  the  recessionto  hit.  Alternative C would probably be more consistent with  thatscenario  than alternative  B, but  I have  to repeat  that  really itdoesn't make  a great  deal  of  difference.  On  the  funds  rate,  for  now Iwould  favor  a ceiling  of  about  18  percent,  but  I am prepared to  raisethe  ceiling  if  market  conditions  [warrant].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  It's  very difficult  to  tell what  effects  ourpolicies  are having.  These high  interest  rates  may hit  some  borrowersvery hard but  they don't  seem to  hit  others at  all,  and the net  effectone  can't  predict.  I see  that  Charlie  Schultz,  after  the  President'sprogram was  announced, predicted  a 2-1/2  percent rise  in GNP  for  1981,so he  doesn't  seem to  think  that  this  has  a very powerful impact.  Iam particularly concerned about  the  inflation  forecast.  I view theforecasts  of  both our  staff and  the  Administration as  wildlyoptimistic.  The  very slight  recession  that we are anticipating  isvery unlikely to make  that  kind of  dent  in  the  inflation  rate.  Ofcourse, we have  a history of  always  underestimating the  rate ofinflation.I am aware  of  the  repercussions  of  a firm policy at  savingsbanks,  small  commercial banks,  and  elsewhere.  As  these  [problems]come  toward us,  we have  to be  prepared to meet  them,  and I think weshould meet  them  in a liberal way--stretch  our powers  as  far as  theycan reasonably be  stretched.  But we  should not be obsessed by  theconcern  that  the  recession may last  a little  longer  or  even be  alittle  deeper.  As  I look back over  our  record, I am  impressed that  wenever  stopped  fighting recession.  We moved  imperceptibly  fromfighting  the  last  recession and  its  consequences  into worrying aboutthe next  recession.  And that  recession  concern essentially hasdominated  our  thinking and has  brought  us  now to  15  percent inflation.It's  a situation with very poor options,  but  I lean  toward the  firmerones.  That  is,  I lean  toward  "C."  The market  has not been impressedby our  policy package  except abroad.  The bond market hasn't respondedvery much.  Short-term rates  are  actually down.  I think there  is  areal  danger that  if we now give  the  impression  that we  are  about  torelax  our  general  credit restraint  behind a shield of  selective  creditcontrols,  we will  get  the worst of  both worlds.  We'll get  theselective  controls  not working--I  have  not been very enthusiasticabout  them anyway--but we  should do  what  we  can not  to disavow  themcompletely.  That  is  best  done by not  throwing any burden on  them andby holding  to  a firm general  control.  I think  it's  important  at  thistime not  to  convey  the  impression  that  the  regular discount  rate,which wasn't  changed, is  the  discount rate  and that  essentially wehave taken  evasive  action in trying  to  avoid raising  the  discountrate.  We  should  so  operate on nonborrowed reserves  that  there  is  a3/18/80-32-good amount  of  borrowing  at  the  surcharge  so  that  the  rate  acquiressome  credibility.Finally,  I share  the  concern about  the  April  bulge.  If wehave  taken  15  percent  out  through the  seasonal  adjustment,  there mustbe a  lot  of money out  there--in reality, people  don't  draw checks  onseasonally adjusted  checking accounts--and  that  may have  its  effect.So  in  addition to  "C" generally, I would like  to  see  a  funds  range  of14  to  20  percent.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Baughman.

[SECTION]

MR. BAUGHMAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to  me  that  our  postureof  restraint had begun  to  bite before  this  past  weekend.  [If  it was]biting before this  past weekend, presumably  it  will  bite a  little morenow.  I have  to  admit  I've held  such views  on  several  earlieroccasions,  so  I don't  know how much weight  to put  on my current  view.We did hear  reports  last week, however,  of  several  real  estatedevelopers  being  cut  off by  large banks  in our District.  Our  recentsurvey of  the  agricultural  credit  situation  does not  reveal  thetightness  that  has been  reported elsewhere  in  the  country.  And I dohave  the  impression  that  our  farmers  are  among  those who  are  carryingexcessive  inventories  at  the present  time,  largely  in  the  interest  ofdeferring  income  tax  liabilities.I don't  know  to what  extent  the Greenbook projections  assumethat  the capacity of  people  to adjust  to an  inflationary environmentis  behind us  or  to  what  extent  it  might  still  be ahead us.  In  my areaI see  indications  of  a  good deal  of  capacity  to  adjust  further.  Someof  this,  of  course,  flows  from the  firm linkage  that  seems  to havedeveloped between  that  area  and  foreign  sources  of  funds  forinvestment.  Just  to  indicate  the  extreme to  which this  seems  to begoing:  I am told that  at  the present  time builders  in  our majorcenters who  complete  expensive houses  which  they don't  sell  promptlyto  local  purchasers  sell  them to  foreign buyers  who  then  furnish themand  rent  them  out.  And  this  is  a means  of  investing  funds  atobviously very low rates  of  return  currently for  the purpose ofgetting  into real  estate,  in  this  instance  in  fairly modest-sizepackages.  There  are a  lot  of  small  business  firms  being sold toforeigners  as well,  all  the  way from  the  family-size  motel  to  thefamily-size manufacturing  firm.  That  seems  to be going  on yet  at  arapid pace.  I note  that  the oil  drillers  have been  in Washingtonrecently;  they have  about  as much reason for  being here at  the  presenttime  as  the  farmers  had  a year  ago  and two years  ago.  The  number  ofactive rigs  is  at  a 23-year  high;  the  increase  during  the past  monthwas  almost  spectacular  and  the  increase  over  the  past year was  alsovery  strong.So,  the  signals  are mixed.  As  I say, it  seems  that  credit  isbiting but  activity  is  still  very strong  and  the  outlook is  strong.  Ithink there's  also  a good deal  of  capacity yet  on the  part  ofindividuals  to adjust  the management  of  their  financial  situation  tocontinued expectations  of  inflation.  Possibly  one  indication  of  thisis  the alacrity with which they  are willing  to  give  up accumulatedinterest  on CDs  for  the  purpose  of  turning  them in  and getting  a newone which will  carry a higher yield.  This  has  resulted  in  actuallines  of  people  at  banks  in  some recent  weeks  when  the new rateannounced was  significantly higher  than  the  rates  on outstanding CDs.3/18/80-33-As  to  monetary policy, the  "C" proposal  seems  preferabletoday, primarily for  the reasons  that  Steve Axilrod  outlined  in hisoral  remarks.  Others  have  commented along  that  line.  That's  all  Ihave to  say.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Teeters.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Mr. Chairman,  I am in  favor  of  alternative  "B."Even  [with  "B"]  the  rate of  growth  [for M-1A]  in  the period  from Aprilto  June would be  dropping  to  almost  half  of what  it  was  in  the  firsttwo months  of  the year;  even compared with  the  first  three  months,it's  very low.  If  we go  to  alternative  "C,"  we're  going to  be cuttinggrowth relative  to  the  first  three months  in half,  and that  implies  tome  a very stringent credit market.  If  people  think they've hadstringency  these  [past  several]  months,  it's  only going to  get  worseif  we  go  to  the  more stringent  specifications.  I will  be  very brief:I support  alternative  "B" as  it now stands  with  the  11-1/2  to  18percent  range on  the  federal  funds  rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I don't  know what's  going to  happen to  theeconomy.  Perhaps  I am associating with people who  are  in difficultsituations  and have  become very pessimistic, and it  may be  affectingme.  So,  I may be more pessimistic  than  I ought  to  be.  I would pointout  that  the projection seems  to me very, very  sensitive  to  the  savingrate.  The projection shows  no  increase  in the  saving rate  in  thesecond quarter and, therefore,  the  second quarter  continues  to be  nota bad quarter.  If  in  fact  the  saving rate  should  increase  in thesecond quarter,  it  would be  a bad quarter  for  the  economy.  And thatcould happen.  On the  other hand,  the projection has  sizable increasesin  the  saving rate  in  the  third  and  fourth quarters, and  those  are  thequarters  of major  recessionary movement.  Whether  those  increasesoccur  or don't  occur will  affect  the  character  of  that pattern.  So,we  still  have  the  uncertainty that  has been with us  for  some time,  andthat  is:  What  is  motivating people  and how might  [their behavior]  bechanging?I do  feel  that  everything that  has happened in  the  last monthhas  increased liquidity preference.  The  rise  in  rates,  which was verysharp  and very noticeable, and  the  cutting off  of  credit  cards  tocertain low  income groups,  even before  the  President's program, havebeen played up in  a major way in  the  local press  here  in Washington.The  feeling that  one might need to  rely on  one's  resources  more and onother people's  resources  less  in  the period ahead  leads  to  an increasein  liquidity preference, which would tend to  give  us  rather largermoney numbers,  generally speaking,  relative to  GNP than was the  casebefore.  I also  think that  the  relationship between M1,  or narrow cashbalances,  and the  real economy  is  changing adversely.  That  is,  ittakes  more and more M1  in order  to  get  a particular real  income;  or weget  less  and  less  real outcome  for  the  same M1  we  had before becauseof  [higher]  cash balances,  to  the  extent  that people  are buying morewith cash and not  using  gasoline credit  cards  and so  forth.  Thecredit  lines  that  have  been extended, many of  which may call  forcompensating balances,  and the  fact  that we  are  forecasting more  andmore  inflation, mean either  that  a given M1  is  going to  carry with ita higher  interest rate  or  lower  real  activity,  or  both.  And I thinkboth is probably the  case.3/18/80-34-So  it  seems  to me  that  it's  just  the wrong time  to bedeparting from the  notion of  a rather  normative,  reasonable increasein  the  monetary aggregates.  I would very much resist moving to  alower  aggregate path like  alternative  C.  If  we  get  the  recession,Emmett, which I believe we  will,  I think we'll  find  that  the  demandfor money in  the  second half  of  the year will  be  low  enough so  thatour problem won't  be  so  much the upper  end of  our  range but keepinggrowth within  the  lower end of  our range.That  brings me  to  one more point, which  is  that  I would hateto  have somebody ask me what  I was  doing  during  the  crash  and have  toremark that  I was defending our  credibility.  The people  who say let'skeep those  interest  rates  up  there,  regardless  of  what  happens, arereally walking  into  a major  trap for  the  economy and  for  the FederalReserve.  I very much want  to  disassociate myself from  that.  I wouldgo with alternative  B.  I would adjust  that  path  and slice  a littleoff  April  and put  it  into May.  I think that  has  the  same  effect,  ifthere  is  a bulge  in April,  as  going with alternative  C.  I amsympathetic  to  the  idea  that we need more  room  in  the  funds  rate rangebecause  there  is  a very good  chance of  a big bulge, and the Managerought  to  be  able  to move  if  there  is  a bulge.  If  there  is  no bulge,  Iwouldn't expect  him to  move.  Therefore,  I rather  like  the  idea of  a14  to  20  percent range  on the  funds  rate  which, with the  rate now atabout  16-1/2  to  17  percent, means we  have some  room on both the upside  and the  down side.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Could I just  ask a question?  Isn't  it  true,  if  westick to  the  4-3/4  percent annual  rate of  growth under alternative B,that we  are going  to have to  reduce  the  rate  of  growth later  in  theyear?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  A little,  but  that will be easy  to  do becausethere  is  a much  lesser demand  for money  in a recession.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Assuming we have a recession.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That's  all  this  is  really saying--how far  one  isgoing  to  let  interest rates  decline  in  the  second half  of  the year.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  But we are  setting the  timing of  the  recessionrather precisely,  it  seems  to me.  And I am not  too  sure  that we'regoing  to  get  it  starting  in  the  second  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well, your  suggestion will  certainly help  assurethat we'll  get  it  because if  we cut  the path in  the  immediate periodto  come,  I would guess we're  talking  about  25  percent  interest rates.And  I think  that--

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Well,  we're really just  talking about  a fewhundred million  dollars  [of  added M1  growth].

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That's  all  right;  it's  a very hard thing tobring about.  It  involves more  in M2  and M3.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  You're absolutely right.3/18/80-35-

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It's  quite  a lot  on  the margin.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Schultz.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I doubt  that  we  can get  out  of  this  situationwithout  a  recession, and  I think  the unkindest  thing we  can do  is  todrag  this  on.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  greatest  pain  can come  if  welet  it  go  on  and  on and our  financial  institutions  really do  begin togo under.  Small  businesses  and others  can  stand a  lot  of pain  forshort  periods  of  time  but  if  this  keeps  dragging  on,  they will  be  indeep  trouble.  I would worry very much about  a big  bulge  in April.  Iam not  strongly  influenced by  alternative B  or  C;  somewhere  in  thatarea would  suit me  fine.  I would like  to  see  the  upper  end  of  thefederal  funds  range  raised to  20  percent.  My feeling  is  that we  oughtto  be  very resistant  to  a big bulge  in  April.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me make a  few  observations  thatoccurred  to  me  in  listening  to  all  this.  First  of  all,  it's  clearthat  the  economy is  fairly  level,  so  any month we  look at  thesefigures we're  going  to  find  some  things  down and some  things up.  Whatthat means  for  the  future  isn't very  clear.  There's  considerablestrength  and resiliency  over  broad areas  of  the  economy or  it  wouldn'tbe  holding level  or a bit  on  the  up  side  in  the  face  of  a decline  inhousing  and  a decline  in  autos  and  some  other  industries.  What  standsout  to me  is  that  we haven't  any room  to  grow here,  given the  declinesin productivity and other  pressures  on  the  economy.  And if  we  triedto  stimulate growth very much, we  really  would have no  chance  ofdealing with the  inflationary psychology;  we'd  in  fact  face  a blow-offon  the  inflation  side if  we  don't  already have  a blow-off.Secondly,  in my  opinion--and everybody can be his  ownpsychologist--at  this  point we don't  have many believers  in  the viewthat  inflation  is  about  to  ease off  or,  indeed, that  the  economy  isabout  to  fall  out  of  bed.  There  is  more  nervousness  than there usedto  be and  some  people  are  beginning to  question whether  they  shouldn'tchange  their views.  It  was  characterized for me  in  talking  to  somefarmers  from Iowa  the  other  day,  and  I think  their attitudes  areprobably  similar  to  [those  held by people  in]  other  sectors  of  theeconomy.  A couple  of  them  sitting near me  said that  they had boughtsome  land  last year  at prices  they  considered exorbitant  but  theybought  it  confidently with  the  thought  that  prices  would be  even moreexorbitant  this  year.  And  they are  wondering whether  they made  a goodbuy.  In  fact,  they're  beginning  to  wonder whether  they could  sell  itor  should sell  it,  but  they haven't  seen  any  evidence  of  a decline  inland prices  up until  now.  They were getting worried but  they hadn'tseen  anything.  I suspect  that  a  lot  of  industrialists  are  thinkingthe  same  thing  in  their own  way.  The  fiscal  policy program--and Ithink it  has  been underestimated  a bit  in  the  public press  for  avariety of  reasons,  political  and  otherwise--I certainly don't  thinkwas  strong  enough  to  change  these  attitudes  in  any  significant way.It  may be  to  the  contrary  in  the  feeling  that  if  anything  is  going tobe  done,  it's going  to be  done  through the  credit  policy side.So far  as  the  outlook  is  concerned,  it  seems murky to  me.  Ihear  all  these  fears  of  recession  and I even  share  them.  But  if  youask me  analytically whether  they  are any more  certain now than  theywere a year ago when we began hearing  the  same  things,  I don't  know.I am pretty well  convinced that  it's  going  to  start  some  time  and  that3/18/80-36-there's  a risk, when it  starts,  that  it may be  greater  than anybody  isprojecting.  But  I thought  that  a year ago,  too.  Just  when  it  willreally start,  who knows?  I know we--all  of  us,  I think--havemisjudged  the  timing again and  again.  I share  the  thoughts  that  somepeople have  expressed, most  recently Governor Schultz,  that we  betterget  this  over with  in  terms  of  minimizing  the total  pain over  a periodof time.  I am worried about  those  financial  institutions,  and theworst  thing that  can happen to  them  is  [for us  to]  fail  to do  the  joband get  the  interest  rate turn  fairly soon.  But the  way to get  theinterest rate  turned is  not by hastening  it  prematurely.  If  we  haveanother false  start,  we'll be  in  considerable  trouble even  though  thatclearly runs  the  risk  of  overkill.  That  risk  is  greater  in  itsinverse logic  than  if  it's not  killed at  all;  we'll  be  faced with  thesame  dilemma  later  on.In  that  connection,  in  getting  out  of  our  dilemma  as  best wecan,  I put  considerable emphasis  on one  aspect  of  the  voluntaryprogram, which is  to get  banks  to  begin saying  "no"  on  some  loans  andnot  to  put  all  the  pressure  on  raising  the  prime rate.  If  the  loandemands  come  home to  roost  [and  they  take  the  latter  approach],  itwill  exert  pressures  throughout  the money market as  they go  out  andtry to  finance  the  loan  increase.  If  we  accomplish nothing else  inthe next  few weeks--and I think the  time  is  very  short--if we  can getthat message  to  the  banks and  they can get  the message  to  theircustomers,  we have  some  chance  of  at  least moderating  the  short-runinterest rate pressures.  I don't  think we  have  a chance ofdissipating  them but we  do of  moderating  them and  getting some  elementof  rationing  in  the  area  of  the  market where it  does  not now exist,namely among  the bigger  business borrowers.  I would urge you to movepromptly on  that  voluntary program  and get  the questionnaires  out  andto  begin on  occasion, or  maybe more  than  on  occasion, a consultativeprocess  with  the banks, particularly  the biggest  banks  in your  areavery promptly.We have  the April problem  that  has been  referred to,  and allof  these  things  incline me toward resolving  doubts in  the  direction ofgreater  tightness  in  the very  short  run rather  than  the  opposite.  Theworst  thing we  could do  is  to  indicate  some backing  off at  this  pointwhen we have  an  announced anti-inflation program.  We have politicalsupport  and understanding  for what  we have been doing.  People  don'texpect  it  to  be  too  easy.  There is  an understanding  that a lot  ofburden has  been placed  on credit policy,  and there's  a willingness  tobe supportive  for  the moment  in  that  connection.  I would not give  allthat much weight  to  the  degree of  support we're going  to get  if  thisis  dragged out  indefinitely and we  have  to go  through  this processonce  again.Where  that  leaves me  in  terms  of  "B" and  "C"--I don't  thinkanybody mentioned  "A"--is that  at  this particular  juncture  I find  thefocus  a little  long,  frankly,  for me  to  come  to  any great  convictionbetween  "B" and  "C."  I share  much of  Governor Rice's  feelings  aboutthose  alternatives.  I do  attach  some  significance  to  the  fact  that  ifwe  took  "B" literally, while  the numbers  as  presented on  page 6 of  theBluebook look  low,  [they  imply]  running  above our  annual  targets  inthe way we  calculate  those  targets.  If  we were  going to  be  at  themidpoint  of  the  annual  target,  it would require  a considerable  declinein  the  second half  of  the year  from the  5-1/4  percent  quarterly growth3/18/80-37-pattern  implied by  "B;"  and  even  "C" is  above the midpoint  of  theannual  target  for  M-1A.  You are  shaking your head  "no."

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  "C" would mean 4-1/4  percent  per quarter  forthe  rest  of  the year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "C" is  5 percent  for  the  first  twoquarters,  as  I have  calculated  it,  and  the  midpoint  [of  our  annualtarget]  is  4-3/4  percent.  It  comes  close  to  the  midpoint but  is  alittle  above.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  because  February  is  behind us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Oh,  there's  no  question  that  we haverecorded a high number  for February, which has  contributed  to  thatresult.  But we  have  recorded  it.  But  again, I  [wouldn't]  worry toomuch about where  this  comes  out  within  a range of  1/4  or  1/2  or  even3/4  percentage point  on a  February-to-June number,  since all  of  thosedifferences  are within our  normal range  of  error  anyway.  That doesn'texcite me  terribly at  this  point.  Other  people may have  differentshadings but whether we're  looking at  "B" or  "C" or  something  inbetween  in the  four-month  time perspective,  I believe  it  catches  thespirit  of  what  a number  of  people  are  saying anyway,  to  say that  inthe next month  or  so--certainly before we next meet--we  should beleaning  toward  taking  our  chances  on being certain  to be near  thosenumbers  in that  very short-run period.  I am not  saying we  canguarantee  that we will  be within those  ranges  at  any expense  ofinterest  rates  or  anything  else.  But when we're making up  the  pathsand deciding what  the  level  of  borrowing  should be  or whatever, weought  to  be  resolving doubts  and making  sure March is  as  low  asprojected and April  is  no  greater  than projected  or  that both of  themare  lower  than projected because  that's  where  our principalvulnerability lies--in  this  two-month period.  If  April  is  anywherenear as  strong as  the New York  figures  suggest, we'll  be  above  the  "B"alternative.  I feel  quite certain that  we  at  least  ought  to beleaning  in  the  other  direction, and  reasonably hard, during  these nextsix weeks  or  so.  We  don't want  to give  the market  a  false  signal  ifthe money supply  comes  in very  low for  a  couple of  weeks  that we  arerelaxing  too quickly during  this  immediate  time  frame, when we've justannounced  these new programs  and there  is  the  kind  of  feeling  in  thecountry  that  I think  exists.  There  is  plenty  of  time  before  June totake  account  of  any  shortfalls we  might have  in  the money  supply ifthat  happy event  should  occur  in the very immediate  future.  I don'tknow what  the March data  are going  to  show.  If  March came  in  underMr. Axilrod's projections  and we were  facing--in terms  of  our  seat-of-the-pants  judgment  or  the  pit  of  our  stomach  or whatever--the  kind ofbulge  that  is  projected for  April, we  ought  to  be  delighted with a  lowAnd whether we  come  out between  "B" and  "C" over  a  four-monthperspective  concerns me  less  than  [that  we  take]  this  posture  I havesuggested before  the next  meeting.  We  could reconcile my  longer-termconcerns by making  it  someplace between  "B" and  "C" but  in  the  end  Icould probably tolerate  either.  But  I do  feel  rather  strongly  aboutnot  giving any  false  signals  in the very  short run  at  the  risk of  anyoverkill  that might be implied by  that.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Would you  consider  taking  a  shorter period oftime--in  other words,  setting a  target  for March through May?3/18/80-38-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I could, but  it's  probably going to  take  alot  of  arithmetic  here.  As  I say, we're  going to  be meeting again  ina month  and we can  fine-tune  the quarter  further  then.  So  that  reallyconcerns me  less  than an understanding  about what  our posture  shouldbe  in  the  next month and how we  will  reconcile  all  the  doubts  anderrors  and  fluctuations  in  figures  that we're  going  to  have  duringthat  time  period.  Whether  it's  expressed  as  aiming  at  "C" or beingextremely  resistant  to  anything above  "B" doesn't  concern me  so muchbecause  I don't  think  those  differences  are  great.  I would put moneyin  the  bank  if  that  happy day arose  at  the end of  March or  early Apriland  the bulge  that  is  being  projected  did not  appear  in  that  extremeform.

[SECTION]

MR. WILLES.  What would you  do  to  the  funds  range?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  feel  terribly  strongly aboutthat  because  we  obviously have a very  flexible  technique  for changingthat  range  if  the  occasion arises.  But  in the  spirit  of  what  I amsaying,  if  the  Committee wanted  to  raise  it--particularly  the upperend--such  a decision would reflect  the  attitude  I am talking about.  Idon't  know whether we'd  have  to  use  [the  full  range]  or not,  andthere's  no  implication  that  we'd go  out  and use  it  because  it's  there.I don't have any particular  expectations  that  the  rate would have  to[reach  that  upper  limit]  or  that  [raising  the  limit]  carries  anyconnotation  at  all  that  we will  aim at  it.  I do  think that we  shouldresolve  the  doubts  on  the  borrowing number by putting  it  a littlehigher  rather  than a little  lower.  And in  that  connection, I am notquite  sure where we  are  specifically.  I have  lost  track  of  thisrecently.  I know borrowings  are  running  over  $3 billion  on an  averagebasis,  but  you were  talking about  a $2-1/2  billion  figure  as--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  We have suggested  a borrowing assumption  of$2-1/2  billion  on  "B" and about  $2-3/4  billion under  "C."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't know what  the  right number  is,  butassuming you  judged  those  two  correctly,  I would be  inclined to  usethe  higher  number.  I am talking about  the  very  short run  for  thestaff's  initial  planning.  Now, if  the money supply came  in  lower,  youwould  reduce  it.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  The  higher number would be more  consistent  withthe  behavior of  borrowing  in  the  last  two weeks.  We're  having a hardtime  interpreting whether  demand or  technical  problems--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  the market  is  confused at  themoment, understandably,  about  what  all  these  recent  actions mean.  Oneinterpretation is  that we would deliberately  try to  ease  pressures  onthe money market.  [Market  participants]  are  looking  for  thesubstitute  in  this  voluntary program.  There's  another interpretationthat  says  that's not  true.  The  former  interpretation would not  behelpful  at this  particular point  in  time,  although  in a  general sensewhat we're  aiming at  is  partly  to  avoid the  extremes,  perhaps,  of  afurther  jack up  [in  interest  rates].  That's  a  little  different  fromsaying we're aiming  to  ease  from where  we are  or  [unintelligible]  ofeasing  from where we are.  But  I have  a concern  that  if  things  wentthe wrong way  and  if  people were  not  over  this psychological humpabout  inflation--which  I don't  think  they are,  although we may bebeginning  to  shake people  a  little--and they relapsed  and  thought  we3/18/80-39-were easing,  that would  involve  the  greatest  chance  that  we'd get  acontinued big  loan demand, which would drive  up  the prime  rate  andgive us  higher  rates.  I  think we're  in  a perverse  situation here.  Ifthose  commitments are  ever  drawn upon, the  banks  are  going to  bepanicky  and  they're  going  to be  putting  their  rates way  up to  protectthemselves.So  you can have  something  concrete  to  shoot  at--and let  mejust  say again  that  the  least  of my  concerns  is  precisely whether it's"B" or  "C" over  a full  four-month period--and  to  capture  slightly  theflavor  of  what  I am  saying,  let  me  suggest  the  following:  For  M-1A,use  2-3/4  percent  for  the  February-to-June number;  put  the  funds  rangeat  14  to  20  percent,  say, which  again  is  no  goal  to  shoot at  obviouslyin  either direction,  but  I'm  trying  to pick up  the  flavor  of  what  hasbeen said around the  table;  and  aim at  $2.7  or  $2-3/4  billion  orsomething  like  that  in  borrowings  in  the  very short  run.  And  for  thisimmediate period, and  I am talking  about a  few weeks  here, let'sreconcile doubts  in  the path-building--which  are plenty, given  theperformance  of  borrowings recently--on  the  side of  being happier aboutan undershoot  of  the present  projections  for March and April  than  anovershoot.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Where  are  borrowings?  Where were  they  lastweek, Steve?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Around  $3.4  billion.  And they're  averaging$3.1  billion thus  far  this  week and were  $1.9  billion yesterday.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  With quite  a  lot  of  excess  reserves  out  there?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  It's  worth keeping  in mind  that one  reasonborrowing has  been high was  the  anticipation of  something  happening  inthe  discount  rate.  Something  did happen and there's  a much greateruncertainty  factor  than usual,  given  the whole  surcharge  situationnow.  I think there  is  more need  for  flexibility  in whateverunderstanding  the  Committee  reaches  on  that  borrowing  level.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  If  borrowings  were,  let's  say,  in  the  $2-1/2  to$3 billion range, what  part  do you  think would be at  the  13  percentrate  and what  part  at  16  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I don't  know.  But  I actually went  back  to[estimate what  that  breakdown would have been  in]  the  fourth quarterof  '79.  And  if  actual borrowing  [and its  distribution]  hadn't  changedbecause  of  the  surcharge--it would have, but  if  it  hadn't--it  turnsout  that  of  the  average  daily borrowing of  $1.8  billion in  thatquarter,  $1.2  billion would have  been at  the  surcharge.  So,  about  2/3of  it  would have  been at  the  surcharge rate.  But what  it  actuallywill  be  over  the  next  four weeks,  I really have no  idea.  It  has beena  little higher  than I would have  suspected.  If  these  banks  try  toavoid  [paying  the high rate]  by not borrowing and we put  in  a targetof  $2-1/2  or  $2-3/4  billion, that  ought  to  put upward  pressure  on  thefunds  rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I missed  a little  of  this.  Any of  theborrowing  figures  we're  talking  about  now are below the  recent  level,which  raises a  little question,  I guess.3/18/80-40-

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I think  that's  appropriate, Paul.  My guess  isthat  the big banks  will  back away  from the  window and  try to  preservetheir  flexibility.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we just  don't  know.  I think  that'spossible.  But  it's  implicit  in  this  that we  start  at  what  is  a lowerlevel  of borrowing  than we have  had just  recently.  And if  the moneysupply figures were  coming in  a little high relative  to  theprojections we now have,  we might  raise  [the  borrowing  level]  a bit.I guess  that's the  implication of  what we're  saying.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I was  assuming, Mr.  Chairman,  that  one  of  theimplications was  that  the  Committee didn't want  to  be as  accommodativein April  as  we had  in  [the  Bluebook]  and  that  for whatever path  theCommittee  decides we  might lower  both March  and April  and shift  alittle  of  that  into May and June.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Mr.  Chairman, I object  strongly to  raising thefloor on  the  funds  range.  I have  a feeling  that when we  hit  therecession we're going to hit  it  very suddenly and that  we may verywell get  into  a credit  crunch.  It  seems  to  me  that  it  would be wiseto keep  the wide band  and as  [much]  flexibility  as  possible.  It  alsogoes with my long-range  feeling that we do  want to  have  a very widerange  on  the  federal  funds  rate  and let  the market  determine  the  ratesover  time.  We  have broadened  the  federal  funds  range,  and I thinkthat was  a move  in  the  right  direction.  I don't mind going  to  [aceiling of]  20  percent, but  I don't particularly want  to  raise  thefloor.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I find  it  very difficult  to  conceive  thatwe're going to  get  to  the  lower  end of  the  range before  the  nextmeeting  anyway.  This  is probably the  least  important number we putdown.  And from  that  [perspective],  it  doesn't  bother me.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I agree  with that,  but  the  idea  of  keeping  therange wide  in case  we do  get  into  a crisis  situation appeals  to me.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  does  seem to  me,  though, Nancy,  [given  that]we have  raised the  discount  rate  since  the  last meeting,  that  toaccept that  floor, which  is  slightly below the  12  percent discountrate  [unintelligible].  Operationally,  one has  to  figure  that bankswould  first  pay off  the  borrowings  before  the  [funds  rate]  went  lower.So,  logically, there  is  a basis  for a one point  increase.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  I still  think the  wider the  range,  the better,because we  really don't know what we will be  getting into  in  the  nexttwo  or  three months.  And the  possibility of  a credit  crunch  is  outthere;  it's  not  an  impossibility at  all.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It's  quite probable.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  That would press  the upper end,  not  the  lower.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  It  depends  on what  happens  afterwards, Henry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think we're  talking about  the visuals  ofwhat  is  announced a month from now and  I can't  convince myself thatthis  is  an  absolutely crucial  decision.  One  could argue  that  raising3/18/80-41-the  funds  range  is  consistent  and reinforces  the  notion that  we're notbacking  off.  On  the  other hand,  if  we don't  change  it,  it  can beinterpreted as  an  indefinite widening  of  the  range.Well, we  have  a small mechanical  problem.  It  is  small  in  onesense;  I don't  know that  it  affects  anything.  The  staff has  writtenthe directive  tentatively to  include  a growth  range  for  the wholefirst half  of  the  year, which makes  it  even less  sensitive  to whatwe're  talking about  in the next month  or  two.  I don't know whetherthat's  a good way to word  it  or  not.  The  only problem with wording  itfor  the  second  quarter--and we  can all  convert  this  into  a  second-quarter  growth  rate--is  that  we don't  know exactly what  the  [first-quarter]  base  is  at  this point.  The  equivalent of  what  I suggested,which  is  2-3/4 percent  for  4 months,  would be  about  4-3/8  percent  forthe  first  half.  And  that  begins  to  look  a  little too  fine.  We  couldsay  4-1/4  percent.  The  last  published target we  had was  4-1/2  percentfor the  first  quarter, which  I take  it we will  exceed.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Make  it  4-1/2  percent  for  the half-year  then.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  can put  in  4-1/2  percent  for  the  half-It  doesn't  capture  the  flavor that  Iyear,  which is  right  on  "B." thought  [we might  want  to  convey]  of  putting  it  a  little below that.But  in  very round numbers,  it's  not  very different.  When we get  downto  the  point  of  how to  express  it  within  a  1/4  of  a point,  it'sdifficult.  The 4-1/2  percent  certainly  implies  no  change.  It  impliesa lower growth  rate  in  the  second quarter  than  in  the  first,  givenwhat we know  at  the moment.  It's  a  little  easier  than  I suggested,but  I suppose we  could take  care of  that by  some  language which saysthat  at  least  for  the moment--I  am  talking  about  the  period to  thenext  meeting--we  want to  be  sure not  to  exceed  [that  growth rate].

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I think  in October  or  sometime  the  language--not  the  number--was  something  like  "4-1/2 percent  or a  little  less."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes, maybe  we can use  that  language.  Ithink  it  captures what  I am  trying  to  say, maybe  better than  I  saidit.  Well,  let me review the  bidding here.  Suppose we put  thedirective  the way it  is  written  [in  the Bluebook]  and  talk about  theentire  half-year  [target  as]  4-1/2  percent  or  a little  less.  For  thefunds rate  range, we would move  the upper end  to  20  percent.  On thelower  end there's  obviously a  difference  of  opinion, which is  going tobe  resolved.  And  in  terms  of  the  projections given  to  us,  we  willlean  to  being within  those projections  for the  March-April  period  insetting  the nonborrowed path  target,  interpreted as  $2-3/4  billion ofborrowings  right  now.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  That  looks  low to  me.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Which one?  The borrowings, Henry?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Based upon  the very recent  experience,  itdoes  look  a little  low.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  the very recent  experience, yesterday, was$1.9  billion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I am not  sure  one  day's  borrowing is--3/18/80-42-

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Except  that  it  was  the  first  day after  thesurcharge.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  We just  don't  know how the  big banks  are  goingto  react  to  this  dual  rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I know we  don't.  I think we'd have  to  saythat  if  we  start  off  there  and  that  level  of  borrowing appears--thoughit's  never  this  clear--to be  accompanied by a  falling  federal  fundsrate  and an  indication of  higher money supply growth, we'd raise  [theborrowing  level].

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  But  there would be almost  no borrowing at  thehigher  rate.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  We  don't  know.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I don't  think  we're capable  of  deciding  this.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  They will  be borrowing at  the higher  rate whenthe  funds  rate  is  at  18  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  I am  trying to  get  is  some  flavor.We have  to make  a  decision as  to  where  to put  [the  initial  borrowingassumption].  I'd  be perfectly happy  to  put  it  higher  and resolve  thedoubt  that  way  in  the  first  round.  In  any event  [the  staff]  needs  toknow what we're aiming  for.  I am saying  that  for  the March-Aprilfigure  together we'd be unhappy if  [money growth]  were not  at  thatrate  and we'd rather  tolerate  a shortfall.  Having  said  that,  there'sno promise we're  going  to  confine  [money  growth]  to  that  rate.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Then you can't  really  confine  the borrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I  don't mean to  confine  it.  All  Iam looking  for  is  some  assumption  to  go  on.  If  you want  to  forgetabout  that,  we'll  solve  it  otherwise  on  the understanding that  we'reaiming  for  4-1/2  percent  or  a  little  less  [M-1A growth]  for  the firsthalf  of  the year.  Now that  brings  us  basically to  "B"  or  less.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  Do  you want to  define  "little"?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  less  than, say, minus  1/2.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We're not  talking about  minus  tenths.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Governor  Partee,  that's  a  reduction ad absurdum.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  No, but  I don't  think we want  [money growth]  tobomb  in  the  next  few months.  And I  can't  accept  more or  less  than--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  nobody's  talking  about more  or  lessbeing minus  ten.  We'll  resolve  these  doubts  on  the  side  of  lessrather than more.  And  if  that  gets  translated  into  the March-Aprilnumber  as projected, we'd be  happy to  come  in  lower  than higher.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Mr.  Chairman, just  to  be  clear:  At  the momentwe're projecting 4.6  percent  [as  the  average M-1A growth  for March  and3/18/80-43-of  this  discussion, I would propose  that  we  tend to  even it  out  [overthe  four-month period ahead].  That  is,  we'd  target  on  something  like3 percent  or  a  little higher in March-April  which would mean May-Junewould be  around 3 percent  or  thereabouts;  the  two  periods would beroughly even.  March would be  low and April  high, but  pressed downrelative  to  what  we show now, depending  on what  the  data we  gettomorrow  look  like.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I resist  a  little the precision  that'simplied  that we  can make  it  2 percent  less  than an  uncertainprojection  that--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Oh, no;  I was  talking about what  we'd targeton, not what we'd  achieve.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that's  one way of  putting  it.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  If  you  did it  that way, that would show realresistance  to  that  April bulge,  if  it  occurs.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  We would be  targeting on  [a  smaller]bulge.  If  it  started  coming  in  even  as high as  we have projected,we'd begin resisting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think we  should kid ourselves,either.  If  the  New York projections  turned out  to be  right and  therewere enormous  upward pressure  [in April],  I don't  think we're  sayingwe would raise  the  federal  funds  rate  to  25  percent  in  order  to get[money growth]  down  to  the  plus  6 percent  [upper  limit  of  our  long-term range  for M-1A].

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  We're not  saying  that,  are we?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think we're  saying that.  I justwanted  to  [clarify  that].

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  The  funds  rate would not  go over  20  percent,  atleast not without  a meeting.  What  happened to  Richmond's projections?Is  Richmond no  longer  in the  projection business?

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  We began  to  have as  many misses as  the  Board'sstaff,  so--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  So  you  gave  it  up?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  it  is  correct  to  say, as  of  nowanyway,  that we're  not  going to  resist  the  April  bulge, whatever  itis,  beyond  a federal  funds  rate of  20  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Unless we  have  a meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know how to  interpret  the silence,but maybe we  ought  to  have  a vote.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  On what?

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  A  little  less  than  "B."3/18/80-44-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  directive will  be  expressed as  4-1/2percent  for  the  first  half  of  the year  or  "a little  less,"  if  you wantthat  modifier  in  there.  On  the  funds  range,  there's  some uncertaintyhere,  but  I  take  it  the upper  end  is  20  percent.  And  I don't  know[about  the  lower  end].  You  don't want  a  change  at  all,  Nancy.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I'd like  to  keep  it  at  11-1/2 percent.  I  justthink it's  a good  idea.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I  like  the broader  range,  too.  There's  someslight--

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  I'd  like  to  keep  the  11-1/2.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me  just  see  what  the  consensus  is.[One  option  is  that]  we  don't move  the  lower  end but  put  the  upper  endat  20  percent.  And that would be  all  that  appears  in  the  directivefor  this  discussion, right?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Right.  [The  range  shown in  the  directive]would be 11-1/2  to  20  percent,  if  that's  what you mean.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I suppose  the M-1B  that  is  consistentwould be  5 percent  or  a  little  less.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Don't you  think  "somewhat less"  is  a  littlemore  dignified?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  "Somewhat less."  Operationally weunderstand  that.  And  there would be  some  language  in  the discussionto  reflect--though I'd hardly put  it  in  these  terms--that we want totake  particular care  not  to  exceed  that  rate  in  the period  immediatelyahead.  To  remain within  [the  six-month target]  is  roughly  the way tosay  it,  I guess,  as  the  March-April  average would work out.  We won'tput  the  borrowing  [assumption]  in  the directive,  but  you understandwhat  the  implications are  for  that.  So,  the  precise  specificationsare  only the  first  two  numbers,  but  there  will be  discussion  [in  thepolicy record]  about  the  importance,  during  the period  immediatelyahead, of  resisting  an  increase  in  the money  supply beyond this  six-month  target.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I  just  want  to be  sure what  that means,  Mr.Chairman.  The  average March-April  rate  of  growth between  "B" and  "C"is  about  4-1/2  percent.  I was  not  going  to build a path on that  buton a  lower rate  of  growth and  then  shift  some  of  it  into  the May-Juneperiod.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  is  the  average?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It's  about  4-1/2 percent--between  "B" and  "C"--for March-April.  Now, we  only know  5 days  in March  for  sure,  so  Marchin  some  sense  is  an unknown.  What  I think  is  consistent with  theCommittee's  discussion--I want  to  be  sure  of  this--is  that  rather thanthe  4-1/2  percent  for March-April  and about  1 percent  for May-June[implied in  the  Bluebook],  I should  shift  some  of  that  growth into3/18/80-45-

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  How much lower?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think we  can  take  care  of  that  inthe  discussion.  I was  just  trying  to  avoid  some wording  that  reliedupon an  internal  projection.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I understand.  I just  want  to  be  sure  that  whatwe're planning  to  do  is  clear  to  the  Committee.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  But how much  lower  in March  and April?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I think we'd have  to  wait  until  we  lookat  the  numbers  and Mr.  Sternlight  and I have  a chance  to  chew  it  over.But  one  thought  would be  simply  to  make March-April  3 percent  and May-use  an  even  [pattern]  if  we  can.  It  doesn't  seem  likely that  growthin March and April will  be  even, but maybe  for  the  two months  itwouldn't be  unreasonable  to  target  it  that  way.  Then if March  turnednegative  at minus  1 percent,  say,  April  could be plus  7 percent.  Thatwould be  an  example.  Or if  March turned out  to  be plus  2 percent,then  the  April  [path]  would drop down to  a plus  4 percent  rate  orsomething  like  that.  It  may not  be  that  even;  it will  depend on whatit  looks  like.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  Mr.  Chairman,  in light  of  Mr.  Pardee's commentthat  the  only thing  that  is  keeping the  dollar  strong  in  foreignexchange markets  is  the  level  of  interest  rates  in  this  country,  Ihave  some  difficulties  in  not moving up  the  floor  [on  the  funds  raterange],  as  a few people have  suggested, to  14  percent.  A  14  to  20percent  range  at  least  is  a 6 percentage  point  spread  as  compared withthe  4-point  range we  started with.  That  14  to  20  percent would be mypreference.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  seems  to be  the  only element  on  whichthere may be  some  substantial  disagreement.  Do you want to  vote  onthe  other parts  and leave  that  open or  vote  on  the  whole thing?  Let'sdo  it  the  other way around and  see  how many Committee members  want  tomove  to  a  14  percent  [lower  limit]  as  proposed.  That  seems  ratherreasonable  to  me.  Let's  look at  two  choices  at  this  point:  Move  itto  14  percent  or  leave  it  where  it  is.  Who  wants  to  leave it  where  itis?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Four, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Who wants  to move  it  to  14?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Five.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And I didn't vote.  I assume we have  oneor  two  [who  didn't  express  a preference].

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Only one.  There are  only  11  members.

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  I don't  think  it's  critical.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  do we have  a  consensus at  13percent?3/18/80-46-

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  It  isn't  how high we  raise  it;  it's whether  weneed to move it  at  all.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I would prefer  13  over--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me  just  try 13  and  see whether  that--

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  As  opposed  to  11-1/2,  I'll  vote  for  13.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  You want  it  as  high as  you  can get  it.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  [Unintelligible]  because  it's  not high  enough.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  I think  that's  five.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I just  don't  know  the  strength  ofconviction of  the  various  sides  here.  But  if  we  make a Solomonicjudgment--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  How many people will  vote  for  anything?

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  The  [decision]  certainly  should not  rise orfall  on  this  issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Let me  just  try the  4-1/2 percent  for  sixmonths  and  the  formal  specification  of  13  to  20  percent, which has  themerit of  being a compromise  if  nothing  else.  Is  that  generallyacceptable?  Okay,  let's  vote.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  One  question:  We  have  4-1/2  percent  orsomewhat  less  for M-1A and  5 percent  or  somewhat  less  for M-1B.  Do  Iassume  the  7-3/4 percent  for M2  stands?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Oh gosh, poor M2  got  lost  in  the  shuffle.could say  "about"  and I suppose  that would be  good enough.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Last  time  the  directive  said  "about."  We

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I'd  rather  let  it  stand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We'll  let  that  stand.  Shall we  have the"about"?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It's  running a  little high.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  About  7-3/4  percent  and then  13  to  20  percenton  the  federal  funds rate  range.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Okay?

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  Having  in mind the  special  credit  restraintprogram  that  the  Federal  Reserve announced  last  Friday, there may besome  advantage  in  including a  sentence  in  the  directive  that wouldmake  reference  to  the  rate of  growth  of  bank credit  falling within  arange  of  6 to  9 percent.  To  have  that  as part  of  the  directive wouldbe  supportive  of  your  commentary over  the  last  3  or  4 days.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Can we  say  that  for  the  first half  of  theyear?  I would agree  with  the  thrust  of what  you're  saying,  thatsomething here  in the directive would be useful.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We  can't have  6 to  9 percent  in  the  first  half.It's  not possible.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  We  don't  think  it's  possible  in  the  first half.Given the  strength we  already  have,  it  would  take an  enormousreduction.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  Maybe  the number  is  not  the precise number  thatwe want.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  We'd have  to  put  it  in terms  of  the whole year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's already  in  for  the whole year,  butit's  not--

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  It's  not  very prominent  in terms  of what  peoplecan  see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I wonder whether we  shouldn't  try  to  getsomething  in this  directive.  Maybe  we  just  can't  put  a number  in  atthis  point but we  can say  "taking account  of  the  need for restraint  onbank credit"  or  some  language  of  that  sort.

[SECTION]

MR. TIMLEN.  Make  it  qualitative  and not  quantitative?

[SECTION]

MR. MAYO.  We  could  say  "taking account  of  our needs  in bankcredit,  consistent  with the  6 to  9 percent  [objective]  for  the  year."

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Or we  could say  "Close attention will be paidto  bank  credit"  or  something  like  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let's  see  if  we're  in agreement.We'll  try to  work on  some phrase, which probably  has  to be qualitativerather  than  quantitative for  the  six-month period, and  get  it  inthere.  And  let's  get  some  discussion  in the  earlier  nondirective part[of  the  policy record]  about  the  importance  of  bank credit,  too.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  You could easily  look  to  a marked slowing  overthe next  two months  from the  recent  [rate].3/18/80-48-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.  Maybe  that's  the way  to put  it  in:"Taking account  of  the need  for  a slowing  in  the  rate of  growth ofbank credit  over  the next  few months,  consistent with  the  objectivefor  the year."There  are  a couple  of  other items  that we  should be  takingup,  if  I can find  [my agenda].  We  have  the  [proposal]  regarding  theauthorization  for domestic  open market  operations.  To the best  of myknowledge  there have been  no  questions raised about  that.  If  we  canget  that  approved, it  would be helpful.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  So moved.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection, that  is  approved.  Thesame  for  the authorization  for  foreign currency  operations.  Noquestions  have been raised.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So  moved.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  There  is  a housekeeping amendment  in  oneparagraph.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  is  that,  Mr. Altmann?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  There  is  just  one  housekeeping amendment.  Inline  with  the changes  in organization  that  the Committee  approved  lastof  the  foreign currency authorization where  the word  "Manager"appears, we would simply change  it  to  "Manager for  ForeignOperations."

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So moved.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection.  Now we go  to  theauthority  for  lending  securities.  This  is  more  substantive.  We'vereviewed this  at  intervals,  quite  a  few  intervals.  I take  it  theproposal  is  to  continue  it  unchanged.  If  nobody has any problems withthat,  I would hope  we  could approve  that  with equal  expedition.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So moved.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection,  that's  approved.  Thewarehousing of  foreign currencies,  I think,  falls  in  the  samecategory.  If  you want  to  have  a discussion  of  that,  I would propose avery  short-term approval  of  [the  current  procedures]  and  consider  itat  a meeting when we  have  time  to  discuss  it.  But  if  it  doesn't  needany discussion, we'll  approve  it  for  another year.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So moved.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.3/18/80 -49-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection,  it's  approved  foranother year.  The  only remaining  item we have  is  the  date  of  the nextmeeting, Tuesday,  April  22.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So moved.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Approved without  objection.  Thank you.
