CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody like  to move  that  list?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are there  any questions or discussion?If not, without  objection  I declare  it  official.The  next  item on  the agenda  is  the  selection of  a FederalReserve  Bank to  execute  transactions  for the  System Open MarketAccount.  Do  I have any nominations?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I will  nominate  the FederalReserve Bank of  New York.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  We  also have  toselect the Manager of  the System Open Market Account.  Our currentincumbent,  as  you know,  is  Peter Fisher,  and unless  I hear objectionsI will  presume  that he  is  required to remain  in  office unanimously.Thank you.  Mr. Fisher, now that  you are re-anointed, you may goforward.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Norm, should we go  on  to  the authorizations?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let's  get those  out of  the way,  sorryabout  that.  We need to.  Peter can't  open his mouth until we  reviewthe Authorization for Domestic Open Market  Operations, but  thatclearly is  a theoretical  issue.  You all  have received the  text  of  theAuthorization and without  objection I will  assume  that  it  is  renewed.We  also have  to  review the  foreign currency instruments--the ForeignCurrency Authorization,  the  Foreign  Currency Directive,  and theProcedural  Instructions with Respect  to  Foreign Currency Operations.The  current versions of  these  instruments were  circulated  to  theCommittee.  Then, of  course, you have  also received a review of  the"warehousing authority" incorporated in both  the Foreign CurrencyAuthorization and the  Foreign Currency Directive.  Does  anybody have1/30-31/96-3-any comments with respect  to any of  those  documents?  If  not,  I willneed two votes.  The  first vote will be  on the  Foreign CurrencyAuthorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the  ProceduralInstructions.  Would somebody like  to move these  items?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Secondly, we needreauthorization of  the  warehousing authority.  Would somebody  like tomove  that?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Thank you very much.A document also has been sent  out to you with proposed changes to  theProgram for  Security of  FOMC Information.  The memorandum, I think,was  reasonably straightforward.  Does anybody wish  to make anycomments  or  ask any questions?  If not, without  objection  I willpresume  that  it  is  authorized.Finally, we come  to  our  regular meeting agenda, and I seekapproval  of  the  minutes  of  the  Federal Open Market Committee  for  themeeting of  December 19,  1995.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I move approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Peter, you haveawaited your  turn and you may now proceed.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can you explain why the  arbitrage  thathas been put in  place by a number  of hedge  funds--that  is,  borrowingyen, converting  to dollars,  and  investing in dollars  unhedged--doesnot  total more  than the  $30  to  $50  billion that  I hear bandied about?Are  those numbers  anywhere close  to being  correct?  I find them verylow for  that  type  of arbitrage  in which there  is  a very substantialpotential  for  a sizable  return.  Let me say  that  it  is  not anarbitrage  transaction;  it  is  double positioning.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Right.  I have  thought  of  it,  and  I think thedollars  against yen.  Secondly,  they choose a sector of  our yieldcurve,  say the  five-  to  ten-year area, in which  to be  long.  They mayhave borrowed yen somewhere  on  their balance  sheet as  well,  given  thelow yen interest  rates.  I don't  have any better  estimates  of what  thetotal positions  are  in  these  transactions  than  the one you  cited, Mr.Chairman.  I think  it  is  a  type of  transaction  that has been  talkedabout more  than  it may have been adopted.  It  has pointed the  overallprincipal  impact  has been in getting people to  think that  the  dollarwas  going to  appreciate and that  there might be value in investingsomewhere  along  the U.S.  yield  curve.  That has  given people greaterand greater confidence.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am not talking about  the U.S. yieldcurve.  I am just  saying that  it  seems  attractive to  go out  and borrowyen at  1/2  percent or whatever, convert  the yen to dollars,  and  invest1/30-31/96the proceeds  in 5-day U.S.  instruments.  The  exchange rate would haveto  fall  fairly substantially to offset  the  gains  in  that  sort of play.So,  I am quite  surprised there  is  not more  of  that  type  ofpositioning.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There  are a number of  financial  intermediarieswho manage discreetly where  they choose  to  borrow and the  size  oftheir positions.  I don't think  that is  being picked up in what peopletalk about as  the  "hedge fund" trades.  The traditional  investmentbanks  simply look around the world  to  finance  themselves at  the lowestcost  they can.  There are people who do  that within  their hierarchies,and there  are other people who choose where they should be  investing.I assume  there  is  a good deal  of  that kind  of  funding  operation goingon.  That may be what you feel  is missing  in  the estimates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me ask another question of  you andperhaps Ted Truman.  Four to  six months  ago,  whenever new data  on thetotal  German  economy were  released, there was a general view that  thedata were  of very poor quality and had to be appraised verycautiously.  Do we have any subsequent  view of whether or not the  dataare more reliable at  this  stage?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They are  still putting out  the data withwarnings  on them and that  could continue  for some  time.  They have  hada number of  changes  in their  statistical  systems  incorporating boththeir going to pan-German data and aligning their statistical  systemswith the European norms.  It  is  not  clear yet what can be  interpretedas  reliable data.  In August or  July they changed their  CPI,  forexample, and all  of  a sudden they lost  1/2  percentage point on  theirrate  of  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's better  than  the central bank!

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I thought it  was very clever myself.  It  elimi-nated the difference between the  French and the German  inflationrates!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions  for Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I want to  ask Peter about  these  sweep accounts.Looking at  the aggregate numbers,  the  introduction of  those accountsaccelerated markedly in  January.  Do you have  any sense  about how farthat phenomenon has played out in  the banking system?  If  itcontinues, what  are the  longer-term  implications with respect  to  thereserve market?  Obviously, reducing required reserves and making upfor  it  by holding excess reserves  is  self-defeating.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I am afraid we all  think it can go  a good bitfurther.  Beyond that,  I don't  know if  we have  anything veryscientific  to  offer you.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  You are right,  President Melzer.  They didaccelerate  in January and also  in December.  We keep projecting thatthe  adoption of  sweep  accounts will  simmer down a little,  and thenanother  large bank or  large bank holding  company chain decides  toadopt  them and the reserves effect  grows even  faster.  I should notethat  the banks compensate not so much by holding  excess reserves,although that  may happen  in the  short  run as  they adjust, but  by1/30-31/96-5-holding clearing balances  that  they  can use  to pay for services.  Butthat has  been a small  fraction of  the reduction in required reserves,I think on the  order of  about 15  percent  on  average.  So,  the  totalrequired reserve balances  do  continue  to drop.  I think our projectionindicates  that  once we got  through  this  seasonal  low, the  rise  in  theseasonal  demand  for reserves  would offset  this  trend, and we would beokay  for  a while.  What will  happen a year from now is  anotherquestion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for Peter?  Peter, didyou request ratification of  foreign currency transactions  as well  asyour domestic  transactions?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I got repaid.  You don't mind that  I got repaidon the Mexican swap drawings!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We have  to  approve repayments?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  You ratify that  I accepted repayment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody like  to move  to ratifyPeter's acceptance  of  the  repayment?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER.  So move.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I second that  and move a favorablereview of  the series  of dances he briefed us  about.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Would somebody liketo move ratification of  the Domestic  Desk  operations?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER. So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let's  now move  on  tothe Chart  Show with Messrs. Prell,  Slifman,  Stockton, and Truman.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We will be  referring  tothe material that  has been placed in  front  of  you.  It's  entitled"Material for Staff  Presentation to  the Federal  Open MarketCommittee."  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

MR. SLIFMAN.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very much.  Any questions  forany of  the  gentlemen?  Mr. Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  I have  a question about  the weakness in  theeconomy that we are  experiencing at the  present  time.  If  I look  atthe quarterly projections  in  the Greenbook, it would  appear that  theweakness  in  the  current quarter  is  temporary and is  related to  someextent to  the weather.  If  you were to  characterize the  futurequarters through  the  end of  1997,  the period would actually showabove-trend growth on  average.  Do you think  that  is  a goodcharacterization of  the forecast?1/30-31/96-6-

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  I would characterize  the  growth  onaverage  after this  quarter  as being  so  close to  the  trend as  not  tobe perceptibly  different.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That's  fine.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Our  forecast does  suggest that  the recentweakness  is  likely to  be  a transitory phenomenon.  In terms of  theavailable  information,  the weakness has been highly concentrated, ineffect,  in the  manufacturing sector, with producers moving quickly  togear production down in  an effort  to  reduce inventory  investment to  amore  sustainable  level.  Once  that  adjustment has  occurred, we  don'thave  a drag  from inventory  investment and we return  to  trend growth.This presumes  that  final  demand  is  reasonably well maintained throughthis process  and that we  don't get  a big contraction in employmentthat would reduce  income  in a serious way.  That  is  the  issue  that wasaddressed by all  of my colleagues  in looking at  some  of the  keysources of  impetus  to  income and employment growth:  business  fixedinvestment, exports,  and reasonably well-sustained  consumer demanddespite  rising consumer debt  burdens.  Weather probably is  a negative,but we  have not  attached a great deal  of  quantitative  significance  tothat  for  the quarter as  a whole.  We  think it  is  damaging in  January,but  that  there will be  a snapback over  the next  couple of months.Construction will resume and we will  get essentially back on track bythe  end of  the  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  The baseline policy assumptions keep  the  economyroughly at  trend?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That  is  our judgment.  As  I have been careful  tosuggest, we would not  say  that we  have  come  close  to  knowing  theserelationships with such precision  that we would want to pinpoint  thefederal  funds  rate  down to  the nearest  quarter of  a percent.  As bestwe can  see  at  this point,  a real  funds  rate  that  currently looks  a bitabove the  historical  average  seems  to  reasonably balance the  risks  andfoster  sustained economic growth  at  a pace  close to  trend growth.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mike, I have  just  a quick question on  thefourth-quarter projection.  As  you pointed out,  total  productionworker hours are reported to  be about  the  same  for the  fourth quarteras  in  the  third quarter.  I know these data  don't  move in  lock step,but we  did get  a significantly stronger GDP  result  in the  thirdquarter  than you are projecting for the  fourth quarter.  Why did youinformation?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Until very close  to the end of  our projectionprocess, we had to  rely very heavily on anecdotal  information.  Towardthe end  of the  process, we  received the  PCE  estimates for  October andestimates did not  suggest a very strong PCE  contribution, whichreinforced the  anecdotal  information  in  leading us  to  discountsomewhat what we were  seeing  in  the hours  data.  Looking at  thebehavior of  the unemployment  rate as  another  labor market  indicator,1/30-31/96we essentially had stability in  that  rate  from  the  third to  the fourthquarters,  which would be broadly consistent with trend growth  ofoutput.  Thus,  2 percent  growth  seemed a reasonable place  to be.  If  Iwent solely by the anecdotal  information,  I might have been  inclinedto write down a lower number.  The retail  sales  data we received thismorning would trim a couple of  tenths  from our projection, all  otherthings equal.  I think we are  in a reasonable ballpark, but  at  thispoint  the  range of possibilities  clearly  is  very wide.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  All things  taken  into  account, I am  struck byyour  fairly benign forecast when I compare  it  with some of  therhetoric  from a lot  of  other sources.  I also was  struck by yourcomment that  if you were going  to rely on  anecdotal  information, youwould have written down a lower number.  I feel  that way also.  Yet,when we look at  the  data, we still  have  this  mix that  looks  prettystrong.  I am referring to  the  housing data, to  auto  sales which don'tlook  too bad despite  a production  cutback, and to  personal  incomewhich looks  fairly good even though consumption has  bounced around abit.  Do you have  any sense of  why people  seem to  talk so  negativelywhen things  really don't  look  that bad?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It  is  always dangerous to  judge  these  things bythe anecdotal  information, though sometimes  such  information providesan  early sign  of a development  that we  can't perceive yet  in  the data.With  the  lags  we have experienced recently in getting the  data,  Ithink we may have  to  look at  those  anecdotal  reports  a little moreclosely than we might usually.  On the statistical  side,  some of  theindications  of  trends have not  been unambiguous,  and some of  them havebeen  surprisingly weak.  Looking at  the housing  indicators,  the  recentpattern of  single-family starts  and sales  has not  been particularlyrobust.  We had a spurt  in  the  summer and  then we  had some  slightsoftening in  home sales  and so  on  through November.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Permits  are not  too bad, though.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Permits  look a little better.  We  are hopeful,looking at  loan applications and so  on,  that  there  is  an uptick intrain, only temporarily  interrupted by all  this  snow.  Looking at  thetrend in capital  goods  orders, we have pointed out  for  some  time  thatthere was  some moderation  in their  growth aside  from computers.  So,  Ithink that  even  the data  show hints of  deceleration.  We  felt  allalong  that that  was  coming and was  appropriate  if  the  Committee wereconcerned about  not overshooting noninflationary  levels  of  resourceutilization.Why are people so  sour  at  this point?  The people  who do  thesurveys  at  the University of  Michigan and the  Conference Board havenoted in  their reports  that  they felt  it was possible  that  the badweather was having  adverse psychological effects.  They also point  tothe  layoff  announcements, which  seem to  have picked up in  the  last  fewmonths  for large  corporations.  The AT&T announcement was  particularlystriking.  The  disarray and closing  of  the  federal government,  whichaffected hundreds of  thousands  of  people directly, may have  leftpeople unsure  about what  kinds  of  stimuli were  coming from  the  federalsector.  These  factors may have played  a role, but  the recent  downturnin the confidence measures comes  after  several months  of very slow1/30-31/96-8-consumption growth.  So,  I am hard pressed to point  to anything verytangible to  explain why we have had this moderation.  I guess this  isone reason we are  in  effect giving  some  weight  to  the possibleindication of some  financial  distress at  a time when  the  stock markethas  been booming.  The  latter  is  certainly an indication  that  someonedoes not  feel  too insecure.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Historically, we have not  had recessions with thestock market  going up.  It would be astonishing if  we were  to  see  amuch weaker picture without  some  softening  in  the  stock market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mike,  you did not mention motor vehiclesin January, which  is  perhaps  the weakest  of  all  of  these.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The  anecdotal  reports  for that  industry are quiteweak and certainly tend to offset  the report  of a spurt  in sales  inmoderate sales pace that  is  quite  consistent with the  trends  that havebeen  in place  for a while.  That  does not  rule out  a downsidesurprise, of  course.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions  for any of  thegentlemen?

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I have  a question for  Dave Stockton relating toChart  17.  It  concerns this  issue about  compensation and labor markettightness.  In  the middle panel,  you make an adjustment  that,  if  Iunderstand the red line  correctly, raises  the help-wanted advertisingindex.  I would think the  implications of  that are  to deepen themystery a bit.  The chart  seems  to be  suggesting  that,  after theadjustment,  help-wanted advertising was  somewhat  greater  than it  wouldhave been measured otherwise, and that would seem to put more pressureon  compensation than we  got.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Indeed it  does  in some  sense.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I understood you to  say the  reverse.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  What  I meant  to  imply was  that  just  looking atthe  unadjusted help-wanted index,  the black  line, might have helped tosolve  the mystery.  One might have  looked at  that and concluded thatthere are many fewer vacancies  at  this point  in  time.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Given our view that  it  probably has become aless reliable indicator, we made  the  adjustment  for  the  increased useof personnel  supply agencies.  But  you are right;  in  some  sense,  theadjustment  does  not resolve the mystery.  The  adjusted index  is  alittle below  the highs  reached in  the  late  1980s, but not very much.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Right,  thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions?1/30-31/96-9-

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I want  to  add something on autos;  I will besaying more later.  We  had conversations  with  one of  the  Big Threeyesterday, and a couple  of  things came  out  on  the picture  for January.One  is  that  they view the  sales  that  they lost  due to  bad weather asjust  temporary.  They expect  to make  those up.  If  somebody is  goingto  buy a car,  they are  still  going  to buy it  a week later  or  two weekslater when the weather  clears up.  Second,  they did seem  to detect  aslight uptick in  sales during  the  last couple weeks  of the month--nothing  to write.home  about, but sales  did seem to  be moving  in theright  direction.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Four-wheel drive vehicles no doubt!

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  No.  Sales of  light  trucks  have  been strong allalong.  Obviously,  cars  sales  are  the area where  there has  been realweakness.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It's  clear  they have made  a move to  reduce  theirproduction  this quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  They perceive that  their earlier expectationswere  too rosy.  We  felt that was  true  all along,  so  the  shock in  termsof our  forecast  is milder.  But  it  has played a role  in  our perceptionthat  this  is  going to  be  a pretty weak quarter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions?  If not,  who wouldlike to  start  our roundtable?  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  First of  all,  our  District has  a very  largefacility that has  recently been added to our  idle  capacity and willstay idle  for a long  time--the  Cleveland Browns'  stadium.  [Laughter]I think Mike  Prell made a remark that  it was  a bad January.It's  always  a bad January  in my District.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It  is  unusual  to  have  it  here in Washington.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  In  December,  the  Chairman remarked that  theeconomy had the  feel  of  a car that  had its hand brake on.  I think theeconomy not  only has  the hand brake  on, but  it  has  a flat  tire.  Webut I know one  of  those tires  is  flat.  We  hear  from large  trucksupply companies  that  their  consensus  forecast  for sales  of  largetrucks  is going to  be  down 28  percent  from last  year.think sales  are going  to  be down  that much;  they say about  20  percent.Large truck sales  set  a record  last year when they were  8 percentabove the previous record in  1994.  In any case,  when activity in  anindustry of  that  size drops  off  that  sharply, there is  going  to be asubstantial  effect.  I am interested in what Mike Moskow  said aboutautos.  Maybe he will  elaborate, because we are not  hearing the  samestory from auto and auto supply  companies  in  our District.  They aremuch weaker.  There  are  indications  that  firms  in  the  steel  industryare going  to try post  another price increase.  They posted one  laststeel prices below their  level  in  the  first  quarter of  last year.Steel executives  continue  to  tell us  about  the new capacity that will1/30-31/96be  coming on  line  this  year and next,  so at  least  some  of  the  folks wehave  talked  to  in  that  industry are  telling us  that  they think  steelprices  are going  to be  under downward pressure.One  of  the  reports that  caught my interest  came  from anexecutive  of  a banking company that  operates  throughout the region.He has  seen a fairly significant pickup  in commercial  loan demand overthe  last  couple  of months.  It  turns out,  however, that  he does  notsee  the pickup as  a sign of  economic strength but rather  of  weakness.He sees  businesses hitting  their bank lines  because  of  cash  flowconstraints related  to growing  inventories  that need to be  financed.His  conjecture is  consistent with  early signs  of  some  deceleration inthe  District business situation  that we  are seeing and hearing  about.Let me  turn to  the Greenbook.  I do not know whether to  beencouraged or discouraged.  On the  one hand, when I look at  the  3percent  inflation projection out  through  1997,  I can't  find itacceptable if we  have an objective of  price stability.  Either we haveto have  a different model because  the current  assumptions  are notgoing to  produce the  result that we want,  or we have  to  cave in  onwhat price performance  is  acceptable.  Don Kohn's presentation  at theCommittee waits  for  something to  happen--is  a positive note.  The  lasttime  there was a break  in the  inflation  trend--from the  4 percent  orso underlying  trend rate  that had prevailed for  7 or  8 years to  a 3percent  trend rate--was  in  1991.  Our staff  does  a break  analysis thatsays  inflation  has  been on a 3 percent  trend since 1991.  My sense  intalking with people, my staff  in particular, and doing some  readingabout  the  1990-91  period is  that  there was no  indication at  the  timethat  a break was  imminent.  Only sometime later could we  say that  thetrend broke and we were now operating at  a 3 percent  inflation rate.There  is  some  tentative evidence  that we  could already be  in  the  earlystages  of  another break, but we are not  going  to know  for a while.Even  though the  central  tendency of  the members' inflation  forecastsprepared for  this  meeting shows  a rate a little below 3 percent, butin  that  range, and the Board staff  projection  is  3 percent,  that  doesnot  discourage me  as  much as  it might normally.  That's because  I donot  think we will  be able  to  anticipate  the  next downward break  in  theunderlying rate.  I would like to  finish  1997  with an  inflation ratearound  2 percent, and I do not  see anything that persuades me  thatthat  is  impossible from here.  I don't really understand, using Don'sframework of  last  December, how we  can know when to  be  opportunisticand respond.  A part of  the  explanation as  to  why the  1995  inflationforecasts  of  a year ago,  our own and the Blue  Chip,  did notmaterialize was  that we had a favorable productivity shock.  If  thatis  a good description of what happened,  that  we got  lucky, thereshould have been some  opportunity  to  lock in a break in  the  trend ofinflation.  I don't  see that  opportunity yet  in  the  forecast.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to  talkabout  Cathy Minehan's perception of why people  feel  so  grumpy and todo so  in  the context  of  the  staff's Chart Show presentation.  LarrySlifman very generously provided charts  11  and 12  a little  earlytoday, so  I had a chance  to  look at  them and at some  of  the databehind them.  I am more pessimistic  than  the  staff  about  the  state  ofthe  household sector.  My first  observation  is  that,  although the1/30-31/96-11-distribution of  assets  and debt--particularly  the  distribution ofassets--does not look  like an issue of  rich or poor,  I don't think theissue of  rich or poor is  the  right way to  look at  it.  If  we  lookwithin each income class, we  get a very different picture  of  thedistribution  of  assets.  Within each class, asset holdings are  highlyskewed.  I have  thrown out  the very poor and  the  very rich incomeclasses because  there  are problems  in  interpreting both of  those.  Ifwe look,  for  example,  at the  $20,000  to  $30,000  income  class and thedistribution  of  interest income within that  class,  the  top 4.7  percentgot  60  percent  and the  top  13  percent  got 79  percent of  the  interestincome received by that  class.  So, it  does not matter  that,  broadlyspeaking,  the $20,000  to  $30,000  class  has some  assets.  Of coursethey  do, but  those  assets are  concentrated in  a handful  of peoplewithin  that  income group.  The  same thing  is  true  further up  theincome  scale.  In  the  $50,000  to  $100,000  income class,  the  top 8.4percent  of  taxpayers  got  70 percent  of  the  interest  income  received byeveryone in  that class.  Again, asset  ownership  is  very concentratedand  is  sorted not by  income but by other factors.  Age probably is  oneof  them.If  we add it  all  up, we  get some  very surprising statistics:1.9  million low to moderate income households with incomes  under$30,000 got  $29  billion of  interest income.  That  is  more  than 16.5million households  earning over  $50,000  received,  including  somemaking more than a quarter of  a million dollars.  Sorting  this  waydoes  not,  in my mind, overcome  the  fact  that  capital  income  isunequally distributed.  It  just happens not  to  be unequallydistributed in ways  that would show up  in total  income.I would like  to  focus,  in particular,  on column  5 in  chart12.  It  shows  financial assets  greater than non-mortgage debt.  Imight mention first  of  all  that  I calculated my own financial  positionand  to my delight  I actually have financial assets greater  than mynon-mortgage debt.  Perhaps  I should pass  that  information on  to  theBank of New York in Delaware!  I am  in the  lucky half of people  in myincome  class.  But  the  fact  is  that half  of  all  people, even  in  thewell-to-do range, have  non-mortgage debt  in excess  of  their  financialassets.  Let  us  focus  on  the median rich person and see what  hashappened since  1992.  In  1992,  household  financial  assets,  accordingto  the flow of  funds,  totaled $16.5  trillion and non-mortgage  debt was$1.2  trillion.  For the person with the median  income those  twonumbers  were  the  same, but  for  the household sector as  a whole,financial  assets were  13.5  times non-mortgage  debt.A way to  start  a simple  thought experiment  is  to  say that12.5/13.5  of  financial  assets  do not count as  far as  the median well-to-do household is  concerned.  What has  happened since 1992?  If wewere  to have no  improvement in  that  situation and no change  in thedistribution  of  financial assets  or debt,  household financial  assetswould need to  have risen by  some  $4.3  trillion by my calculations  tooffset  the reported increase  in non-mortgage debt.  In  fact,  theincrease has  been only about  3/4  of  that  amount.  So,  again,  justtaking  the numbers  in  the table and assuming no  changes indistribution,  we have had a worsening of column  5 since 1992.  Inother words  far more  than half  of  upper  income households,  not  tomention  lower  income households,  do not now have  financial assets  thatexceed  their debt.  I think even  that  result may be optimistic.  Thereason  for that  has  to  do with the Census  Bureau report on what  has1/30-31/96-12-happened to  income  since 1992.  In  the  aggregate, income  has  donequite well.  We have had roughly a 5 percent  increase in householdreal  income,  but 77  percent  of  all  the  income  gains went  to  the top  5percent  of households;  21 percent went  to  the next  15  percent.  Theremaining 80 percent  of  households  shared only 2 percent of  all  theincome gains  over  the  last  two  years  for which we have  these data,1993  and 1994.  I would suggest  that  a lot  of  these people probablyhave had their debts worsen relative  to  their  financial  assets.The  last  point I would make, and  it relates  to  the  top ofchart  12,  is  that  starting in  the  third quarter of  1994  through  thethird quarter of  1995,  households have actually been net sellers  ofstock according  to  the  flow of  funds  data.  This  is  not  countingcapital gains.  The reason why that might be  troubling  is  that,  in  abooming  stock market,  they must be  liquidating some  of  their holdingsto pay off  something.  I would suggest, however,  that households  arein  fact consuming  some  of  their  capital  gains  in  order to  cover  short-falls between  their income and  their consumption.  So,  there is  reasonto be pessimistic, not  in  the  overall  numbers  but  in looking moreclosely at  the  majority of households  that  have not  been enjoyingincome gains  and are  trying to maintain  levels  of  consumption.  Thankyou.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would like  to  ask one question of MikePrell  or Dave  Stockton or Larry Lindsey--whoever knows  the answer.The directly held corporate  equities to which Governor Lindsey hasbeen referring include both closely-held  small  corporations  andpublicly marketable  corporations.  The equity that  is  available  in  thefirst  case  is  obviously  highly illiquid.  Do we know what proportionof  the directly-held corporate  stock of  households,  excluding mutualfunds,  is  traded on public markets?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I am sorry, but  I do not have an immediateanswer.  I have  seen  estimates,  but  that  information  is  not  readilyavailable  to me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I do not  know the  answer  either, and Iwould appreciate  it  if  someone  could get  the  information.  It  might beuseful  to  evaluate the  extent  of directly held stock  in  the context ofGovernor Lindsey's discussion  in which he  raised a considerable  issuewith regard  to  the  financial  condition of  the household  sector.President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, economic growth  in  the  TwelfthDistrict  has been exceeding that  of  the nation in  recent months.  Thewestern states  of Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Oregon continue to beamong the  fastest  growing in  the nation.  Labor demand and theconsumer  sector have remained buoyant  in  these  areas.  Oregon's  taxreceipts  grew fast enough  in  the  last  fiscal year  for  the  state  toissue a partial  rebate in November, boosting holiday  season retailsales.  California had been holding  down the District's  overallperformance, but  its  economy  is  now expanding  faster  than the  rest ofthe United  States according to  data  from the  state.  Even inWashington State, where many were worried about disruptions from  theBoeing strike until  it  ended in mid-November, anecdotal  reportssuggest  strong subsequent  retail activity.  Of  course,  Districtretailers  did not have  to  contend with  the paralyzing storms  thatlocked up other areas  of  the country, and the  December federal1/30-31/96-13-government  shutdown noticeably hurt  retailers  in  only a few of  themost  tourist-dependent  areas.Our District also  seems  to  be relatively well  positioned toweather  sluggish demand growth  in the  European economies.  TwelfthDistrict  states export more  to  newly  industrialized Asian countriesand Japan than to  Europe.  We are also producing a lot  of hightechnology equipment  for which export  demand has been strong.  Thesefactors helped District exports  to  increase faster  than  total U.S.exports  last  year, excluding  a decline  in  aircraft exports  fromWashington  State.Turning  to  the national  economy, based upon recent anecdotaland financial data  and the  recently available monthly indicators,  Ithink we can place a low probability on  the  economy going  into  a slumpin  1996.  Moreover, because of  long  lags,  the  inflation outlook  thisyear--and I would say even next year--is barely affected byuncertainties about  economic  activity.  I remain skeptical  that  therecent dropoff  in  inflation will  be maintained.  The unemployment  rateremains  somewhat below, and certainly  is  not  significantly above,  mostestimates  of  the natural  rate.  In  addition, the recent beneficialeffects  of  lower health care  costs  on overall  inflation are  likely  todissipate  in the  future.  As  a result,  I concur with the Greenbook inexpecting CPI  inflation  this year to be  at  or  somewhat  above  lastyear's  rate.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  The economy in  the  Philadelphia District wasslowing  during  the  final months of  1995,  and this  slower  trend hascarried over  into  1996,  aggravated by unusually bad weather.  Theretail  sector has  been  soft.  Holiday sales  were below expectations,and January sales  have  been hurt by  severe weather.  Auto  sales werefairly good in December but  fell  sharply in  January.  Manufacturingshows  declining demand.  Most  manufacturers  indicate that  inventoriesare not  at worrisome  levels.  Realtors by and large say  that mostexception was  southern New Jersey.  Rental  rates  rose  in some  areasand were  steady in others.  Landlord concessions were  less  significantlast year.  The demand for  industrial  space  exceeds  the  supply.  Thedemand for  retail  space, however, is  soft  except  for  largesupermarkets  and other very large  retail  operations.  The residentialThe  outlook for the regional  economy in  1996  is  cautiouslyoptimistic, with more emphasis  on  "cautious" than  "optimistic."Business people  are  hopeful,  but they are more concerned about  theoutlook now than  they were  six weeks  ago.  I sense more  concern, morerestlessness, more  jitteriness,  all  of  which would dissipate with acouple of good months  or alternatively intensify with a couple moresoft months.  Price  and wage pressures  remain subdued, with  fiercecompetition and job insecurity acting as  dampers.  The persistentdownsizing, with  layoffs at  all  levels  regardless of performance, notonly  is  undermining consumer confidence  in the  District but it  is  alsoundermining employee morale  in  affected companies.  In  fact,  there hasbeen modest  job  growth  in  the region, but  the widespread perception  isone  of  job loss.1/30-31/96-14-Turning to  the national  economy, the most likely path for1996  is  moderate growth and contained inflation.  I sense  somewhatmore  downside risk to  growth, however,  than upside.  I think  theconsumer sector  is  a clear risk, and the  export sector is  anothersource  of uncertainty.  The inflation outlook strikes  me as moresymmetrical;  I think that  the  occurrence of  less  inflation  is  about aslikely as  the development  of  more  inflation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, the  Fifth District economy isstill  expanding although probably at  a somewhat  slower rate in recentweeks.  I get  this  information  from  several  sources.  We do  somesurveys,  such as  our  regular manufacturing and  service  sector survey,which suggests  some deceleration  in both of  these areas  as  in  otherparts  of  the country.  We  are getting  a good bit  of negative anecdotalinformation about retail  spending.  On  that  score, we  have foursizable retail  chains headquartered in Richmond, all  of  which havebeen reporting weaker  sales  for the month of December.  Also,is  the CEO  of  a large  home  improvement  and buildingMany of you, I am sure,  are  familiar with  it.supply He  told us a couple  of weeks  ago  that his  sales  had dropped  inSome  reports,  notably  from West Virginia where much  of  the  industrialactivity in our District  is  located, have been on the more bullishside.  For example,  chemical producers  there are  still operating  atclose  to  capacity levels,  and a big machinery manufacturer expectsanother year  of  good sales  following a strong  showing last year.  Onbalance, however,  I would have  to  say that  these optimistic  reportsare  in the minority.  The bottom line  is  that business activity in ourregion generally appears  to be moving ahead more slowly.  I don't getthe  sense  that  activity is  declining in  any precipitous way as  yet,despite  the snowfall  that  shut down much of  our District  for  a coupleof days  and despite  the government  shutdown, which  I believe wouldhave  a larger  impact on  our  District than on many others.On the national  scene,  the  information  that we have receivedover recent weeks  obviously is  still  incomplete, but  it  suggests  onbalance  that  the economy was at  least holding its  own through  the  endof  last year.  As  I mentioned earlier, some  of  the  best  informationthat we have  on  the  fourth quarter is  the  labor market data.  Theyinclude what  I believe  is  the most  specific and comprehensive measure,production worker hours,  and that was  a reasonably strong  figure.  Itwas  consistent with a fairly good GDP result  in  the  third quarter.  Onthe  spending  side,  of  course, we have anecdotal  reports  of weakholiday sales despite discounting.  I don't think we  can ignore  thosereports, but we have  to wonder how much of  this  is  really a reflectionof  weaker  aggregate demand and how much may be  a reflection ofextraordinary structural  changes  that  are  taking place  in  thatindustry.  In  fact,  a lot  of  the  hard data  for  the  fourth quarter  areactually fairly  strong.  I have not had a chance to  look at  the retailsales  data  that  were released today nor  the consumer sentiment figuresthat you mentioned earlier, Mike, but  I think  I am correct  in  sayingthat  the level  of  consumer spending  in November was  a couplepercentage points higher  than  the  third-quarter average.  And untilthis  latest consumer confidence  figure was  released,  those data wereholding up quite well.  The  series  is  volatile and the recent periodin which that  survey was  taken was  an unusually rough one.  As  a1/30-31/96-15-result,  the consumer confidence data may not be a very accurateindicator  of  true  sentiment.  Apart  from federal  expenditures,  I don'tsee  any signs  of precipitous deceleration in  the  other sectors  of  theeconomy.  So, on balance,  it  seems  to me  that  the  information we nowhave  says  that  the  economy is  "hanging in  there,"  to use  a slangphrase, at  a fairly high  level  of  activity in relation to  capacity  inmany industries and in  labor markets.Finally, these Humphrey-Hawkins meetings give us  a chance  tofocus  a little more  specifically on  our progress  toward our  longer-term price  stability objective.  I have  a couple  of  quick thoughtsabout  that.  On a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis,  the CPI  hasrisen about  2-3/4 percent  in each  of the  last  three years.  TheGreenbook is  now projecting that  inflation will move up  slightly toabout  3 percent  in  1996  and 1997.  It  also  is  projecting the  samegeneral  pattern for the  core  CPI  over  that  two-year period.Obviously, that would not be a huge  setback, but  it  would be a move inthe wrong  direction and it would mean a couple  of years withoutfurther progress toward  our  longer-term objective.  Also, if we  studythe numbers  carefully, I think we are beginning to  see  some  faint,  butnonetheless discernible,  signs  of  a firming  in wages  and labor costs.A couple of points  relating to  this  firming  that  I noted in readingover  the Greenbook:  the  increase in average hourly earnings was  2.8percent  in  1994  and  3.2  percent  in  1995.  This  may be  evidence  thatthe  economy is  operating  in the neighborhood of  the NAIRU without  alot  of head room.  Also,  I noticed  that  the Greenbook  is  projecting a3.1  percent  increase in  the  employment cost  index in  1997  comparedwith 2.6  percent  in  1995.  Again, none of  this  indicates  a severeimpending setback  to  our  longer-run  efforts to  bring the inflationrate  down, but  it  does suggest  less  progress than we should be  lookingfor  in the  future.  This  should have  some bearing on  our  discussion ofboth the  short-term and long-term policy situation  later on.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

MS. MINEHAN.  New England grew more  slowly in  the  second halfof  1995  than in  the  first  half, and  its  slowdown was more pronouncedthan  that of  the nation as  a whole.  Moreover,  in terms  of  employment,the  region saw a change  in  the  types  of  industries experiencing eithergrowth or at  least  declining trends  in job  losses.  The  region'smanufacturing industries  continued to  lose  jobs,  but the  rate  ofEngland previously had been exceeding  the national rate  of  job  lossfor  most of  this recovery.  By  contrast,  the nonmanufacturing sectorthat  has  led our  recovery, such as  it has been so  far,  only grew atabout half  the national pace  last year.  The  weakness was concentratedin  the  finance, real  estate,  and insurance areas where jobs  declinedfrom December to  December, but  retailing  and transportation were  alsoweak.Reflecting the  relatively favorable employment  trends,manufacturing reported satisfactory results  for  the year, particularlythe smaller  firms.  These  firms are  operating with some spare capacityas  evidenced by a small  survey that was  done right after  the blizzardto  determine the  impact of  that weather phenomenon on production.  Theresponses  highlighted the  fact  that despite  the  closing of  localproduction facilities  for  a day or  two, most  firms  probably will beable  to make up  all  the  lost output within a month.  Only one firm,  a1/30-31/96-16-medical  instruments producer, did not anticipate being able  to make upthe  lost output  simply because  they already were operating at  fullcapacity.  Manufacturers  also report  few price pressures  and no majorconcerns  about labor costs  or  availability except  for particularlyhigh-tech specialties.  Retailing,  in contrast,  had a very weakholiday season.  While consumer demand was  lackluster, we believe  thatretailers were affected as  much by  the fact  that  the New Englandregion  is  more  "over-stored" than elsewhere  in  the  country.  Sales  forthe  regional  chains have  been disappointing despite  heavy promotions,again partly due to  the  continued expansion of national  superstorechains  such as Wal-Mart.  The commercial  real  estate market  is  said tobe  steady.  Insurance  contacts reported strong  sales  for  the  fourthquarter but  indicated  that their  employment was flat  to down.On a state-by-state basis,  the  northern tier of  statescontinues  its  pattern of  relatively strong growth, while Connecticutand Rhode Island continue  to  lose jobs.  Massachusetts  is  on a solidif  not spectacular growth path and  is  the only New England state wherecurrent patterns of  growth are well  in line  with historical  patterns.Every other state  is  weaker than usual over a long period.Turning to  the nation, despite  the lack of  good data, abackground of  negative rhetoric,  and the noise introduced bygovernment shutdowns,  snow storms,  floods, and whatnot,  I continue tobe  struck by the  continuing sense  of slow but  solid growth  in  suchareas as housing, overall  employment,  personal income,  and auto  sales--with some blips  in January--and by the  ebullience of  financialpressure, although there  could very well be  some  uptick in  inflation,as  Bob  Parry mentioned.  It  seems  to me that  we ought  to be  fairlyhappy with this  set of  circumstances  and fairly happy as well with  theGreenbook projections.  In  that regard, we have relatively fewdifferences with the  Greenbook projections.  They strike us  as  a tadoverly optimistic  in  terms  of  the  foreign outlook,  for example, but ingeneral we  agree.  It  is  unlikely that  we  are  going to  see  thestraight  line patterns  through 1997  that  are projected in  theGreenbook.  There  is  certainly some  risk that  this  expansion isreaching a cyclical peak  and that  downside risks have  increasedsomewhat.  But  that said,  I still  think that  the near-term prospectslook reasonably good, and we need to maintain  some  concern about  wherewe  are with respect to  capacity constraints.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  To answer  Cathy'squestion on  changes  in consumer confidence,  I am struck by the  factthat  I have  a pretty good report for my District,  and I am beginningto wonder if  I ought  to  give  it  or not!  Our District  economycontinues  to  be  strong overall with only a few signs  of  weakness  in acouple  of areas  that  I will mention.  For  example,  gains  in payrollemployment during the  fourth quarter were  solid throughout ourDistrict.  District manufacturers  continued to  operate at  or nearcapacity, with a couple of  exceptions.  Good growth  in  the durablegoods manufacturing  sector has  continued.  Our directors  reportcontinued strength in  commercial  construction activity in many, if  notmost, parts  of  the  District and even  some modest pickup in residential1/30-31/96-17-construction.  Capital  and loans  are  still  available  and evenplentiful  in some cases.Although the  District  economy is  generally healthy, there area couple  of weak spots:  energy activity remains  sluggish despite  somerecent price increases,  and continued financial  losses  in the  cattleindustry are hurting  our  farm income outlook  even though crop pricesare at  their highest  levels  in  some years.  Wage and price pressuresremain modest  in  the District  despite  overall strength  in the  economy.Labor markets  remain tight  in  some parts of  the District and  some  ofour manufacturers  continue  to report  shortages  of skilled labor.Despite  that,  upward pressures on wages and prices  remain subdued.For  the national economy, our projections are  very similar  tothose in  the  Greenbook.  On  the  real  side, we agree  that  the  outlookremains  favorable, with real  GDP  likely to  run at  or perhaps  a littlebelow potential.  Because  of  the mild overshooting in  the  level  ofresource use  that  we have experienced, however, I think we will  see  aninflation number that  is  comparable to  last year's,  about 3.0  or  3.1percent.  So,  I think  the  Greenbook is  a little optimistic on  thatfront.  Also, with growth running  somewhat below potential,  I expectunemployment  to  drift up a little this  year.  Still,  we  areessentially  in agreement with  the Greenbook, and we  share the  viewthat  the  economy  is  on sound footing  at  this time.  Overall,  thefundamentals  remain sound or satisfactory as we  look to  the  future.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, economic  activity in  the  SeventhDistrict continues  to  expand but at  a moderating rate,  as  I mentionedat  our  last meeting.  I sense  that we  are outperforming  the rest  ofthe  country, with some  sectors  experiencing weakness and othersstrength.  Fairly strong business activity was  reported for farm andheavy equipment manufacturers,  the  light  truck  segment  of  the  autoindustry, the  professional  services  sector, and the  food segment ofthe  retail  services sector.  The  farm equipment  manufacturers arebenefitting  from the high  grain prices  of  last year.The  sectors  that display some weakness  include  cars and heavytrucks  as  well as  some retail  segments.  On balance, the  reports  fromour retailers were mixed, indicating that January sales were coming inat or  somewhat below expectations.  Those expectations  seem to bequite modest, with a couple  of  retail chains  looking  for January  same-store  sales  to  be about  unchanged or up  only 1 or 2 percent  from lastyear.  Our contacts among national retailers  said that  their  SeventhDistrict store sales were  holding up better than  elsewhere  in thecountry, in part because our  District weather has been relatively morefavorable  to  date.  Reports  on retail  inventories also were mixed;several  larger  retail chains were in  good shape, while other retailerswere  still  trying  to  trim their inventories.  The effects  oflackluster Christmas  sales  and excess capacity continue  to have  anadverse impact  on District  specialty retailers.  Store  closingscontinue to be reported in  this  sector.  Seventh District  respondentsto  the Senior Loan Officer Survey expressed concerns about  retailtrade  lending, both for working capital and for real estate basedloans.  Housing activity is  still  fairly strong in most parts of  theDistrict,  as  shown by our data after adjusting them  as best  as we  canfor  the weather.1/30-31/96-18-In the  motor vehicle  industry, demand  for light  trucksremains  fairly strong, but  that  is  not  true for  cars and heavy trucks,as  Jerry Jordan and I mentioned earlier.  In terms  of  the  orders  forlight  trucks, the  sales  figures  for  January are particularly difficultto  interpret  because  of  the  shifting of  a few days'  sales  from  earlydisruptions.  To  elaborate  on what  I mentioned earlier, January is  notgoing  to be a good month overall  for  auto  sales,  though sales  improvedslightly as  the month proceeded.  Our  contacts  suggest  that  auto  salesnationwide will be  in the  low 14 million range  in January.  If  weaverage that with December, the  number will  exceed  15  million units,which is  a relatively healthy pace.  Sales  for  the entire  year  in 1995were  14.8  million units.  Of  course,  there are  incentives  in place  toboost  sales,  and those  incentives have either been  increased or  theywill be  in response  to  inventory  imbalances and the need to  remaincompetitive.  Mike Prell  mentioned that  first-quarter production plansfor  cars  have been cut  back further  to adjust  for high inventories.To give you some  examples  of  the  ripple  effect of  these productioncuts, weakening order rates  in January have been  reported by our  autosuppliers  for mufflers, brakes, bearings,  piston  rings,  and relatedproducts.  So  far,  there  has been no  reduction in purchase  orders  forsteel  by the  auto  companies.  As  Jerry mentioned before, steel  pricesare down significantly.  Two increases  are  scheduled and there  is,  ofcourse,  some uncertainty as  to whether those  increases  will  hold.Turning  to  the  heavy truck industry, production will  be downsignificantly  from  1995,  but  output  in 1996  should be  closer to  thenormal  trend.  This  is  in  line with what  we talked  about last  fallwhen the  orders were dropping  significantly, but manufacturers weremaintaining their production levels.  Obviously, they had  to  catch upat  some point.  In 1994  and much  of  last  year, it was  orders  from thelarge haulers that  supported  the market.  More recently,  the orderrate has  reflected demand  from the  small-  and medium-sized  shippers,with cancellations  by the  large  haulers compensating  for  over-orderinglast year.District manufacturing activity outside  the motor vehicleindustry continues  to  expand, although at  a more modest pace.  Thepurchasing managers'  surveys  for Chicago, Detroit,  and Milwaukeeindicated expanding orders  and production  in December.  In contrast,Detroit's  auto  component in  the purchasing managers'  survey  showedcontracting  activity in western Michigan.  In January, the  Chicagopurchasing managers'  index, which should be coming  out  tomorrow and isconfidential until  then, is  at  50.9,  down  from 54.8  in December.  Thisis  an  indication of  a continuing but more modest  expansion  in theearly part  of  the year.Economic  activity in the  agricultural  sector has been mixed.Corn and soybean producers enjoyed a very good year, but  livestockproducers found 1995  particularly tough due in part to  the  high costof  feed grain.  A growing shortage  of  corn  combined with its  highprice may force  livestock producers  to  liquidate  significant portionsof  their stock in  early  1996,  increasing the volatility of meatprices.  However,  there is  little evidence as yet  that such  aliquidation  is  starting.  There  is  a great deal  of  uncertainty aboutacreage planning decisions  for  1996  since Congress  has not yet  passednew farm legislation, which is  particularly important  for thatindustry.1/30-31/96-19-Business  loan growth at  District banks  has  started  tomoderate in  line  with  the general  slowdown in  fourth-quarter businessactivity.  Credit quality generally remains  quite good on  thecommercial  side.  On  the  consumer side,  consumer debt burdens  appearto  be  stabilizing and the  rate of  increase  in consumer  loandelinquencies  appears  to  be moderating.Labor markets generally continue  to  be tight  throughout theDistrict, especially  in  Indiana,  Iowa, and parts  of Wisconsin.  Pricepatterns  in  the District  do not  seem to have changed much since  ourlast  meeting.  Reports  generally point  to  little upward pressure  onprices.  In January, the pricing component  of  the  Chicago purchasingmanagers'  survey was  53.8,  down more  than 2 points  from December.Turning  to the  national picture, we don't have any seriousdisagreements  with the Greenbook outlook.  We are  still  a bit moreoptimistic on both growth and inflation, but the differences are notlarge.  We  see the  economy expanding near its potential  growth ratethis year.  We do  seem to be  at the mature  stage  of  the  expansion, asGovernor Yellen mentioned at  the  last meeting.  The acceleratoreffects  are dying  out now.  So,  while  I am  sympathetic  to  the notionthat  the  risks to  the outlook are probably concentrated  on the downside,  I don't see  any compelling evidence  in the  data that  wouldsuggest  the economy will  not grow at  its potential  rate  this year.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President Melzer.

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I have  four  major points  that  Iwant  to  make  today.  The  first  is  that  the  Eighth District economycontinues  to grow at  a slow but steady pace.  Our  average unemploymentrate  stood at  4-1/2 percent  in  November compared with 5.6  percentnationally.  Payroll  employment growth in  the  District outpaced thatin  the  nation during  the  fall.  Much of  this strength can  beattributed to  our services  sectors.  Nonetheless,  in manufacturingfirst-quarter auto  production in  the District  is  expected to be  upsubstantially from  its year-ago level;  most of  that  jump  is  due  toadded capacity, primarily in  light  trucks and recreational vehicles.Retailers  report that holiday  sales  were  somewhat  higher than  lastyear's  levels,  although the growth rate was below that  of  last year.The number of nonresidential building permits  is  well  above 1994levels  in  the District's major metropolitan areas.  Lenders  reportgenerally healthy  loan demand and supply  conditions, with  theexceptions of middle market business lending and consumer autolending.Turning to  the national perspective, my second point  is  thatjob creation has moved in  line with projections  for labor  forcegrowth.  The average monthly gain in nonfarm payroll employment  sinceper month  that we enjoyed from  January 1994  through March 1995.  Butthe  earlier rapid pace of  job  creation was unsustainable and widelyexpected to moderate.  The more  recent pace is  consistent with the BLSprojected rate of  labor  force  growth of  about  1 percent or  110,000jobs per month.  In addition,  the  job gains  of November and Decemberwere  reasonably robust according  to  this benchmark,  and theunemployment  rate remains  low.  During  the intermeeting period verylittle other  data became available,  and it  seems  to me, as  some othershave said,  that  it  is  difficult  to  argue  that much has  changed  since1/30-31/96-20-the  last  meeting with respect  to  the  actual performance of  the  realeconomy.My third point, and unfortunately one  that  I have  had to makea number  of  times,  is  that virtually no  gains were made  on inflationduring 1995.  Consumer price inflation  is  expected to be about  thesame  for  all  of  1995  as  it was  in 1994.  For  the  current year,  someanalysts  suggest  that  food prices will  increase  at  their fastest pacesince  1990.  Mike Prell mentioned this,  as  did Mike Moskow.  This  isconsistent with what  I am hearing from who headsa major rice and soybean cooperative.  He has  been concerned about  thecombination  of  these very  low carryover stocks,  drought  conditions  inparts  of  South America, and what he  sees  as  very strong export  demandfrom  the  Far East.  He  envisions  the  potential of  some possibly verylarge  feed grain price  increases in  the  course of  this  year.  Moregenerally, market participants  and professional  economic  forecastersdo not  expect  lower inflation  in  the  foreseeable  future.  In  theirthrough the  fourth quarter  of  1997.  The Greenbook  forecast is  aboutthe  same.  Longer-term inflation  expectations  have moderated somewhat,but  these  forecasts  do not  indicate  any further progress  toward pricestability.  Longer-term forecasts  still  have  inflation  running atabout  3 percent.We will  talk more  about  this  tomorrow, but  in my view theCommittee  should develop  a plan  to move toward price stability andoffer markets convincing  evidence that  it will  be achieved in  somereasonable time  frame.  One  simple  and direct way to  convey ourintentions  to market participants would be  to  announce now theCommittee's  inflation forecast  for,  say, each  of  the next  five years.In our Humphrey-Hawkins projections,  we are  asked to  assume anappropriate monetary policy, and we  prepared our  1996 Humphrey-Hawkinsforecast based on  that approach  toward policy.  In my view, that  wouldbegin with a CPI  inflation target  of about  2-3/4 percent  this  year,would envision growth in  1996 around  the high end of  the centraltendency ranges  for nominal  and real  GDP and inflation near  the  lowend of  the  central  tendency range  for prices.My final point  is  that, based on  financial market behaviorand the  growth of  money and credit  in  recent months,  it  isincreasingly difficult in my view to  argue that  monetary policy isrestrictive.  Longer-term bond yields  have  held their  ground since  thegrowth prospects  in  1996 by aiding the housing  industry, businessinvestment,  and mortgage refinancing activity.  The  stock market, ofcourse,  continues  to  set new records  on the  up  side on a daily basis,and credit remains  readily available.  The broad monetary aggregatesare growing  at  the  top of  the  Committee's target ranges.  I don't meanto  suggest  that  that  implies any action;  it  is  just  an  indicator ofwhere we are.  Narrower aggregates  adjusted for  the effects  of  sweepaccount activity have been  increasing quite rapidly  in recent months.Financial  market  expectations of  a 50  basis point  reduction in  the  fedfunds  rate  by midyear  also  incorporate a 3 percent  inflationprojection for as  far as  the eye  can  see.  If  that  is  not the  goal  ofthis Committee,  then I think we had better  think  twice aboutfulfilling  these  expectations in  the  funds  market.1/30-31/96-21-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

MR. MCTEER.  On our twelve-wheeler,  the  Eleventh Districttire  is  not  flat,  at  least not yet, but we  do hear a strange hissingsound.  [Laughter]  Our directors  and other  contacts,  as has  beenmentioned here  before,  are more pessimistic  looking forward than  thebackward-looking numbers would suggest.  I don't have  an  answer  toCathy's question, but it  does  remind me of  something Richard Pryorsaid  several years  ago:  "Who are  you going  to believe, me  or your ownlying  eyes?"  But  at  least  looking back, 1995  was a good year  in  theEleventh District.  Our estimates  indicate  that employment  grew over 3percent  in Texas,  about  5 percent  in New Mexico,  and almost 2 percentin Louisiana.  That contrasts  with about  1.5  percent  for  the  nation.Construction activity remained high, with single-family constructiontaking off  in the  second half of  the year and all  three  Districtstates  registering double-digit growth  in construction  employmentsince  the middle  of  the year.  Building contract values are up  sharplyin New Mexico and are holding steady  at  a relatively high  level  inTexas.  Trucking deregulation lowered  in-state trucking  rates  andspurred a lot  of warehouse  expansion  in Texas.  It  is  taking somebusiness  from neighboring states where trucks  previously had to hideout  to  avoid Texas  regulations.  Electronics  and other high-techindustries continue  to boom in  the  Southwest.  In  1995,  electronicsemployment  surged 7-1/2 percent  in  Texas and nearly 12  percent  in NewMexico.  The  three U.S.  semiconductors plants  that  opened their doorsin  1995  were all  located in  the  Southwest:  two  in Texas  and one  in TomHoenig's part  of New Mexico.  Samsung Electronics  just announced theirplan to  open a $1.3  billion semiconductor plant  in Austin, withgroundbreaking beginning  in  a couple of months.A 35  percent real  devaluation of  the peso  turned out  to  be adrag on the Texas  economy but not an  anchor.  Exports to  Mexico areway down over  the year, but  exports  from Texas  to  other countries  havepicked up  to take up most  of  the  slack.  A boom in maquiladoraemployment  along the border  has  cushioned the blow for bordercommunities like  El  Paso.  However, border retailers were hit hard andthey have not yet  recovered.  Real  oil  prices are  less  than half whatthey were  in  the  early 1980s, but  the  energy  industry has perked up  asproducers use  relatively new technologies,  such  as  horizontal drillingand 3-dimensional  seismic  technology for offshore drilling in  the  Gulfof Mexico,  to make  a profit  at prices  that would not have been closeto profitable  in prior years.  One anecdote  on the new technology isthat  they are  constructing a new Bush library at Texas A&M University,and at  the  same  time  they are drilling  for oil  under it.  [Laughter]Based on  our  discussions with our  directors and Beigebookcontacts,  the  outlook for  1996  seems  reasonably good, but we  expectgrowth this year  to be somewhat  subdued  compared to  last  year.  We arealready seeing four  national trends  that  are beginning  to affect  ourDistrict  adversely.  First, there  are  signs  that  the  expansion hasalready slowed.  In  the  January Beigebook, Dallas was one of  eightFederal Reserve Districts  reporting a slowdown in  the pace of  economicexpansion.  Our main indicators  of  a slight slowdown in growth werereports of weak retail  sales  and somewhat weaker orders  for paper,apparel,  lumber, and commodity chemicals.  Contacts also  indicatedthat  semiconductor  orders were slightly below their previously veryhigh levels.1/30-31/96-22-The  second major trend is  that  labor market  tightness  ispushing up wages  or restraining the  ability  of  some  firms  to  expandproduction.  Our contacts have mentioned labor market  tightness  ineight  of  the  last nine  Beigebooks, but  the problem has been morewidespread since September.  Contacts  and press  reports indicatecurrent  shortages  of  electricians,  engineers, accountants,  truckdrivers,  software  designers and semi-skilled workers.  One  contactreports  that his  temporary employment  firm formerly pounded thepavement to  find more  customers, meaning  employers, but now they arepounding the  pavement to  find more employees.  Not surprisingly, laborfor production workers  in manufacturing have  turned up  fairly sharplysince midyear.  The  contacts report  that higher wages  are squeezingprofit margins, but they have not been passed on  in  the  form of  higherprices.The  third trend  is  that  retail consolidation has begun in  ourregion and will  likely continue.  Christmas  sales  were  verydisappointing, and our contacts  highlighted the Mexican border as  oneof  the worst performing  regions.  Furthermore, border sales  are  likelyto  remain soft  for at  least  the near  future,  since the purchasingpower of  the peso has not recovered.Fourth,  the gridlock in Washington is  becoming a real  problemfor District  farmers.  There may be snow on  the  ground in  the East,but  it  is  almost planting time  for  farmers in  the  lower Rio GrandeValley.  As Mike Moskow mentioned, the  gridlock is  interfering withthe  farmers'  ability  to  make decisions  and with banks' willingness  tolend to  farmers.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  economy of  theNinth District  remains  fundamentally healthy, and some parts  of  theregion are very  strong.  Overall,  growth has moderated and there aremore  crosscurrents than had been the case until  recently.  One  area  ofthe  District economy that  continues  to be  relatively soft  ismanufacturing.  For  example, the paper industry, which had been verystrong,  is  showing  signs  of  appreciably weakening prices.  And thatseems  likely to  continue  for  some  time, given  the  capacity in  thatindustry which,  if  anything, is  expanding.  Retail  spending has  beenlackluster  except  for  the consumer  electronics area where  sales  arequite  good.  On the  more positive side,  labor markets  remain  tight,but  there are only scattered signs  of more rapid increases  in wages.I would say that  in general  housing activity is  good;  housing aroundthe District  clearly is  benefitting  from the  current  level  of  interestrates.With regard to  the national economy,  I find myself  in generalagreement with the  contours of  the  Greenbook  forecast.  Because of  theinventory situation, I think that  the  first quarter or  perhaps  thefirst  half  of  this  year will be on  the soft  side.  I have commented onthat  before, and  I don't  see anything that  changes my assessment  ofthat  situation.  Once  the economy gets  through the  inventoryadjustment,  I don't see  any major obstacles  to  a resumption of  growthat a rate in  the neighborhood of potential.  Tom Melzer made  animportant point when he  talked about  staff expectations  of  future netgains  in employment  of  about  100,000  or a little more per month.  The1/30-31/96-23-reason I feel  that  is  important  is  that  if  we  get  the projectedemployment  increases, while  they may be what we  ought  to  expect,  thepress  is  going to  play such gains  as very disappointing as  they didwith the  December employment  report.  That may create misleadingexpectations  that we ought  to be  careful  of.With regard to  the risks  to  the  expansion, I think theyinclude the  export situation  on  the down  side.  I am not persuadedthat major  foreign economies will  live  up  to  even our modestexpectations  for  them.  It  seems  to  me that more  often  than not  inrecent years we have been disappointed by  their performance.  As  faras  the consumer is  concerned, I don't  see  a vulnerability  there  thatin and of  itself  is  going to  trigger a disappointing economicperformance.  If we get some  weakening there,  it  will  be  endogenous.My reading  of consumer  incomes,  debt burdens,  asset distributions, andso  forth,  is  that  if  some development  does  trigger  a downturn, thereprobably is  some vulnerability  in the  consumer sector  that may add tothe  downside momentum, but  I don't detect  a lot  of weakness comingfrom the  consumer.On the up side,  one  can point  to a couple  of  sectors.  Thefirst is  housing, which  I think will  benefit  from  low interest  rates.The  other  is  investment  in producers durable  equipment;  my impressionis  that  such capital  investment will turn  in  another healthy year in1996 and perhaps  in  1997.  I noticed when  I got  to part  II  of  theGreenbook that most  of  the  fundamental determinants  of PDE  lookedpositive  in historical  context.  So, we  may do a little better  thanthe  forecasts  in a couple of  sectors.As  far  as  the  inflation  outlook is  concerned,  I don't  thinkwe will  do much worse, and we may come  out  a little better,  than  theGreenbook  forecast because  of  some dynamics  that  seem  to be  occurringwhich I don't  quite understand.  When we  look at  traditional measuresof  capacity use and what  they ought to  mean  for wage  or pricepressures, we just  don't seem  to  be getting  that  translation in  thegood old-fashioned way.  I think that  is  actually a plus.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Theanecdotal  evidence  in  the  Second District  in recent weeks has  beenvery negative, but  that  is probably more the  mindset of  the people  inthe  District  than  anything else.  The broader economic  data have  beensomewhat  more positive recently.  In  the  labor markets, privatepayroll  employment rose  at  an annual rate  of  1-1/2  percent in  Decemberin New York State and was  stable  in New Jersey.  The monthlyunemployment rate rose  in December in both  states, but we  tend  tosmooth  that rate  over  a quarterly average.  On that basis,  theunemployment  rate  in New York State actually declined from  6.7  to  6.2percent  from the  third  to  the  fourth quarter  and was  unchanged in NewJersey.  Consumer spending as  reflected  in  retail  sales  taxcollections rose moderately in  December in New York, led by stronggains  in New York City.  Our manufacturing contacts  reported that theblizzard had minimal  effect on production in  the  Second District,  andthat  any losses  would be  quickly made up.  In  fact,  our  recent surveyof manufacturers, some  of which are  among the nation's  largestemployers,  was quite  fascinating.  The majority of  them  expect unitsales to  increase  in  1996,  but  they say that competition will prevent1/30-31/96-24-them from raising prices.  Wages  are expected to  rise  3 to  4 percent,and capital spending will  be  similar  to  that  of  1995.  Their mostoptimistic view of  the world is  that  they think their exports will  begrowing in  the  5 to  10  percent  range, about  the  same as  in  1995.On the national  level,  assuming that monetary policy remainsthe  same,  our  forecast  is  somewhat  different  from that  of  theGreenbook.  We have real  GDP somewhat weaker, growing 1.7 percent  in1996  and dropping  off  slightly to 1.6  percent  in  1997.  We have  theunemployment rate  going up  to  5.9 percent  in  1996  and 6.2  percent  in1997.  We  have  found the  employment picture  somewhat confusing, as  Ithink many people have.  One  of  the  things we have  found difficult  toexplain is  that participation rates  in  the  labor  force by women and byteenagers  of both  sexes  are holding  relatively steady, but  theparticipation rate  by adult males has been coming  down over the lastfew years.  I am not  certain  that anybody has a very good  explanation,but  it  may be  that  the  5.6 percent  unemployment rate  is  suggestinggreater  tightness  in the  labor markets  than really exists.  That willbe one of  our research projects.We  have  the  CPI about  the same  in 1996  as  it  came  out  lastyear;  we have  it  at  2.8  percent  and dropping off  to  2.7 percent  in1997.  Again, we have  trouble, as  I think most people do,  inanticipating  exactly what will  happen  to prices because neither we  norany other  countries that  seem  to provide  a relevant comparison have awhole  lot  of  experience with what  happens  to prices when  the  CPI  is  atthe  2.8,  2.9,  3 percent  level.  We have  essentially no experience  inestimating  the cost  of  going to price  stability, assuming as  I do  thatit  is  something below 3 percent.  But  if  we want  to  reduce  inflation,it  would be nice  to  know what  that will  cost,  rather  than saying it  issomething  that warms the  cockles of  our  theological  heart.  That  againis  a major project that  we  are  looking  at.  Without  the knowledge  ofthe  cost  of  lowering inflation further,  we are  not very content--I  amnot very content--with our  economic  forecast.  A real  GDP growth rateof  1.7  percent  this year and  1.6 percent  next year,  essentially nogain on price  stability, and, we  think, a rising  unemployment rate donot  lead us  to  believe that  the basic assumption of  unchanged monetarypolicy has a whole lot  going for it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy  of  theAtlanta District  is  still  growing at  a moderate pace  and maintains  itsadvantage  over the  national growth rate, as  best we can tell.  But we,too,  are seeing  signs  of  deceleration.  Nonetheless,  while cyclicalfactors at  the national  level may be  damping growth for  our part  ofthe  country, the  Southeast  economy  is  likely on balance  to enjoymoderate growth throughout 1996.  The Southeast  continues  to benefitfrom some  longstanding secular  trends:  in-migration  of population andcorporate relocations  driven by rapid growth  rates and relativelyfavorable cost  factors.  We  do not  see this  abating  any time  soon.This  feeds  retail  trade,  services, and construction, all  of  which aregenerally healthy  in our region at  the present  time.Construction  is  holding firm, and this  is not  just  theAtlanta Olympics  effect buttressing the region's overall  indicators.The most  active component  is  industrial  construction  dominated bywarehouse and distribution centers.  Inventories  of  unsold houses1/30-31/96-25-remain extremely low and multifamily activity remains  strong, althoughvacancy rates  recently have begun to  rise and we  expect  to  see  aslowdown  in multifamily construction later  this  year.  As you know, wehave  a concentration of  construction-related manufacturing in  theSoutheast.  So,  while  industrial production continues  to weaken, theslowdown  is  less pronounced  in  our region of  the  country, and it  hasbeen cushioned by  the  continued migration  of  auto-related productionto  our southeastern states.  This growth has  continued even thoughthat  in  the auto  industry as  a whole has  slowed.  Al  Broaddus and Iare beginning to  steal  some of  your auto  jobs, Mike!  I don't know  ifthat  is  for better  or  for worse, but  they continue to move to  our partof  the country, not  only the assembly jobs  but all of  the  supportactivities.  Even  so,  Sixth District job growth decelerated in  thefourth quarter.  Weakness in our  area  is particularly noticeable  inthe nondurable manufacturing  sector.  Still,  our region's year-over-year job growth  outpaced the nation by a considerable margin in  1995.We  see no  discernible  evidence  at  the present  time  of  acceleration  inoverall  wages  or prices.  Our manufacturers'  survey indicates  lessprice pressure on  finished goods but  some  increase in pressure oninput  prices.Turning to  the national  economy, overall  I see  the  economycontinuing  to  move forward without major  impediments, but also  withoutthe momentum that we saw  earlier.  Our outlook  has not  changedsubstantively  for a number of  months.  As has  been  the  case recently,the Atlanta forecast  and  the Greenbook are  fairly close.  Atlanta  haspersonal  consumption  growing more  slowly than  the Greenbook, but wehave  stronger business  fixed  investment and net  exports.  Bothforecasts  show real  GDP growing close  to  2 percent  over  the next twoyears, and each  has inflation  continuing at  a rate not  far  from recentexperience although we have  the CPI  on a very slow decelerationcourse.  Neither  forecast  sees much change  in  the  expectedunemployment  rate.  The difference between  our  outlook and that  of  theBoard  staff  is  in  the  interpretation  of potential.  Our  reading of  theGreenbook is  that  it  shows  an economy expanding near potential  andthat  faster growth will  inevitably result in  accelerating  inflation.We see potential  as  probably somewhat higher.  Importantly, we believethat  the current modest  and steady  inflation environment  is  a resultof  15  years of  anti-inflationary monetary policy;  it  is  not somespontaneous  reduction  in  inflation expectations  but  a rationalresponse to  a less  inflationary environment.  Of  course,  this  issomething  that  I can't demonstrate  categorically, but I believe  thatevidence  from both  the  labor markets and the  financial markets  tendsto  support  this view.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman, as  you know the  current Greenbookprojection is  quite  similar  to, but perhaps  a little weaker  than,  thelast  several  forecasts.  The main new weakness  is  that  occurring inthis  quarter, and that does  appear  likely to  materialize,  given whatwe know now.  Thus,  I would agree  that  the Greenbook's  assessment  ofthe  entire period is probably the best  one  that  we can  get.  If  Icould get  a guaranteed delivery on  that  outcome,  I would buy it  eventhough  it  does  not project any further  improvement  in inflation overthe projection period.  But,  of course,  there  is  no guaranteeddelivery, and we have  to  look at where  the possible deviations mightoccur.1/30-31/96-26-First  of  all  on  the up  side,  it  seems  to me  that  a breakout,defined as  growth well  above  trend in  the near or  intermediate term,perhaps  should not be  taken  totally  off  the table but it  appears  tohave  a very low probability.  The  Greenbook's trend projection goesdown  the middle  and, of  course,  it  does  not  anticipate any great shockor  surprise  in either  direction.  If  we don't  get any major shock,  Ithink the Greenbook  forecast  is  very, very likely to  materialize.  Itis  very attractive.  It  extends near-trend growth over  a substantialperiod, projects moderate unemployment  and a somewhat lower  than thegenerally accepted level  for  the NAIRU, and it  projects relatively  lowinflation.  I would add Al  Broaddus's caution  that  this projectionshows  some acceleration  of wage increases,  and I think that  is  quitelikely to  be  the  case later  in  the period.  Unless productivity alsoincreases materially  over  that period, we may see unit  labor cost  andproduction  figures  in  1996  that  could add to  inflation  in  1997  andbeyond.  Downside  shocks  are always possible,  and when  the economy isoperating  at a level  that  is  a little weaker  than before,  it  takessomewhat  less  of  a shock  or disappointment  to knock  it  off  stride.  Inmy mind, the  downside risks  are  somewhat higher  than I had earlierthought  because the  expansion does  appear  to be slower  than  I hadhoped  or expected.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There  is  more fogthan usual  in Washington and  in  the outlook.  Some of  this  uncertaintyis  caused by the data  situation.  From the perspective  of a rear-viewmirror, the data are  less  reliable  than usual  due, of  course,  todelays  and revisions  and weather  disruptions.  I suspect  that we maynot be able  to  assess  fully what has happened in the  fourth quarter  oreven  in the  first  quarter until we  are well  into  the second quarter.The  federal budget  situation may be  a bit clearer in  the  short  run,but  it  is  certainly a lot less  clear  for the  longer term.  In  the nearterm, we probably will have  some  reduction in  federal  spending eitherunder continuing resolutions  or  a series  of  appropriations bills.  Therange of  issues  is  narrowing, and all  sides  are  focusing on deficitreduction.  With respect  to  the  longer  term, the  delay of  a budgetagreement means  that  fundamental policy questions  such as  theappropriate expenditure  levels  for Medicare and Medicaid are not goingto  be answered until  after  the  elections.  This  is  a problem becauseelections don't  always provide very clear mandates,  so  I think thatcreates a bit more  fog with  respect to  federal government  expendituresin  the  future.I think  that  the best  current projection  for GDP  growth  isabout 2 percent, or  close to  potential.  There are  a number ofdevelopments that  in my view are  consistent with  a moderate growthoutlook and a reasonably stable  employment  situation.  By  that  I meanthat people are working, though not necessarily at  jobs  that  theyprefer, so  that a lot  of  working people would be willing to  changejobs.  I suspect the  5.6  percent unemployment  rate  is  more flexiblethan history would  suggest.  This may be  part of  the response to CathyMinehan's  question;  people  are  grumpy partly because  of  jobuncertainty.  That  attitude will be  reflected in consumer  spending.There is  no reason necessarily  to  see a major decline  in  consumerspending, and  likewise there  is  not much room for  a significantincrease.  We have worked through  the pent-up demand from  the  early1990s, but with the increased  debt levels  that people have assumed,1/30-31/96-27-consumption is  likely at best  to  track income growth.  As  has  beenmentioned, we  have an  inventory  overhang in  some  sectors,  some  of  itthe result  of  a disappointing fourth quarter.  Hopefully,  on  the otherhand, managers  are developing better  inventory management  techniques.A slowdown in  industrial production has been cited, but  in  spite ofthat  slowdown, we are  still  seeing  corporate profits  and cash  flowsthat  are better than  anticipated.  Some  of  that  results  from  increasedinvestment  in machines and equipment  to  increase  capacity and  improveproductivity.  The  fundamentals  favor  continued growth in  capitalinvestment,  though probably not  at  the 1994  and 1995  levels.Nevertheless,  this  sector should  continue to  support  economic  growth.The  capital markets  are not  going to  be a bottleneck, at  least  fromwhat we can tell  now.  The  stock markets  have been strong;  they  appearto be supported by earnings.  Declines  in  long-term  interest ratesshould also  contribute to  keeping  the  cost of  capital  down.  Creditgrowth has  slowed but  credit is  still  available.  So, there  are nobottlenecks  in  the  capital markets  to  prevent  business investment.Turning  to  inflation, I think  that  some  arguments  can be madefor  a more optimistic projection  than  the  staff forecast  of  3 percent.Moderate growth,  capacity increases,  lower utilization,  andinternational weakness should help  to  relieve  demand pressures  oncommodity prices.  Recent  consumer and business behavior,  I believe,is  consistent with  a reduced inflation psychology, but  I wouldcertainly grant  that  there  are risks.  One  of  the risks,  to which  Ithink we must be particularly alert,  is  that wage pressures may bereemerging and we are unlikely to get  any more  gains  on  the benefitsside.To  summarize,  a key question for us  is  the  sustainability ofmoderate growth.  I see  little chance of  a breakout on  the  up  side,and that leads me  to  conclude that  there probably are more  risks  onthe  down side.  I can't really see any likely  sources  for  a potentialbreakout on  the up side.  I suspect  that we  are going to be gettingmore pressure for higher  growth  levels.  We  are starting to  see  iteven  in  the business press.  Although people around this  table  thinkthat  2 percent  growth with  low inflation  and a strong dollar is  a goodsituation, the  question is  whether that will  be socially andpolitically acceptable.  The  expectations  for  the U.S. economy are  fora boom-and-bust cycle,  and I don't  know whether people  have learned  tomanage sustainable  growth.  I think expectations differ  from  economicreality, which may be  another part  of  the answer  to  Cathy Minehan'squestion.  I believe that we will  start  to  see pressure build  forfaster growth.

MS.  YELLEN.  As  I outlined my thoughts  on the  nationaleconomy  in preparation  for  today's meeting,  I realized that  I amrunning  the risk  of sounding  like  a broken record by reiteratingthemes  that are  completely familiar, given the  remarks  I have beenmaking during  the  last  several meetings.  With respect  to  inflation, Ihave  not  seen  any reason to  alter my view that  it  is  unlikely to movehigher  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  economy  is  operating with ameasured unemployment rate  that  is  a tad below  the  staff's and mosteconomists' point  estimates  of  the natural  rate.  In  that regard,  Ithink  it  is  important  to  remember that  even if  we  fully accept thenatural  rate  hypothesis,  the  natural rate  is  a parameter that  not only1/30-31/96-28-changes  over  time but also  is very  imprecisely estimated.  A recentpaper  that some  of you  are  familiar with applies  every conceivableeconometric  bell  and whistle  to  compute  a confidence  interval  for thenatural  rate of  unemployment.  It  is  hard to  get it  down below 2percentage points  for  a 95  percent confidence  interval.  That  isdisconcertingly wide,  and I interpret  that  as  a good measure  of  ourignorance  on  this.  So,  I think it  also  is  worthwhile to  look at  othermeasures of  inflation pressures--capacity utilization, vendorperformance,  order backlogs,  strike activity, and so  forth.  Lookingat  those measures,  I see  no  intensification of underlying  inflationaryforces  at  this point.  As  President  Broaddus mentioned, hourlyearnings  have edged a little higher,  and that  is  something we willhave  to watch.  But  in my view, total  compensation is  what matters,and  the ECI  does  not  show upward movement,  although  it  certainly wouldbe nice  to have a recent reading.  In addition, I see  commodity pricesand intermediate materials prices  as well  behaved, and the dollar hasappreciated.With respect to  the pace of  economic activity,  the new chain-weighted GDP  figures reveal  an  economy that  grew over  the  first  threequarters  of  1995  at  a pace  a bit  shy of  the  likely growth  of potentialoutput,  which staff now estimates  at  1.9 percent.  With  the governmentshutdown and the blizzard,  interpretations  of  the  statistics  for  thefourth quarter  of  1995  and the  current quarter are  obviously quiteconfusing, but my sense on  balance  is  that  growth has weakened a bitand I am becoming--to use  the  same word that  Ed Boehne used--a bitmore jittery and marginally more pessimistic about  the  short-termoutlook.  Today's report  on retail  sales  coupled with a plunge  in theConference Board's measure  of  consumer confidence--to which we  shouldnot overreact--reinforces my view that  there  is  some downside risk.The level  of  inventory investment remains  above  the normal  level  thatwould be  associated with an economy growing  at potential.  So,  I agreewith the Greenbook assessment that declining  inventory  investment isgoing  to remain  a drag on  economic  activity for a time,  and theplanned reductions  in motor vehicle assemblies  that  several  of youmentioned may indeed have ripple  effects  throughout  the  economy.  AsMike  Prell noted in the  Chart Show, the moving average of  unemploymentclaims has  edged upward.  Unemployment  expectations  in  the Michigansurvey, which are significantly related  to  growth of  consumptionspending,  do appear  to  be on  an uptrend even  if  one  abstracts  from avery significant  recent  run-up in  December.  One  of  the  facts  thatalways astounds me  about  the American economy  is how a large  number ofjobs  are permanently destroyed in  any year,  good and bad.  Recentestimates place  this  loss  at  about  10  percent  of  all  American jobs  inany given year,  even in  good years.  Since  it  is  very clear  that weare  always getting  substantial  restructuring both within  and acrossindustries,  we  should not  be surprised when we hear announcements  oflayoffs,  even significant  ones.  But  having said  that,  I also sensethat  the very large  and very visible  job  losses  like  those  that  wererecently announced by AT&T do attract  widespread attention  andreinforce what  I perceive to be  an ongoing  sense  of  apprehension  inthe workforce about employment prospects, with  implications  for wagesand also potentially for  consumer spending.Ted Truman emphasized that  the behavior of  the  dollar mattersto  the  forecast.  The dollar  has appreciated about 3 percent  on atrade-weighted basis  since  our  last meeting.  If  we aggregatemovements  in  the dollar  together with  changes  in  short-term  interest1/30-31/96-29-rates  into a single index, which  is  sometimes  called the monetaryconditions  index--if  I have done this properly and used a reasonableweight  on exchange rate changes  of  about  1/6  or  1/7--my calculationwould be that  this  appreciation since  our  last meeting is  equivalentto  an  increase  of  about 40  basis points  in  the  federal  funds  rate.The Greenbook certainly recognizes  that  the  appreciation of  the  dollarwill  produce a drag  on net  exports  down the  road.  I also wouldunderscore another point  that  the Greenbook makes, which is  that  theof  further Fed easing.  If  this  expectation is  frustrated,  there maywell be  further dollar appreciation.With respect  to  the  intermediate-run forecast  through  1997,  Iemphasized previously my view that  the American economic house  isfundamentally  sound but that  there  is  this  little problem of  "termitesin  the basement"  or  a bias  toward below-trend growth, and  I have notaltered my view on that one  iota.  I am not going  to  take  the  time  toreiterate  all  the  reasons  I gave last  time,  but a prominent  factor inmy own thinking  is  the behavior of  longer-term  interest  rates.  Theserates have  fallen and are  imparting  impetus to  the economy.  I thinkthat  impetus will  continue for a time,  but  it  is  going to  ebbeventually and we will be  left  with a risk of  subpar  growth over themedium term.  I certainly  am not  envisioning an  economy  that  isheading  for an  imminent recession, but  I think a growth recession withgradually rising unemployment  is  a distinct  risk  if  we keep  the  fundsrate where  it  is  now.  That  is  roughly the  same  level  in  real  termsthat we reached  last  February when most  of  us  considered monetaryconditions to  be  quite appropriately somewhat  restrictive.A number  of  you around  the  table have  emphasized  that we needto have  a strategy in mind for  reducing inflation.  I certainly agreewith that  and  in  that regard  I would  endorse the  opportunisticstrategy that  Don described in his  sermon last  time.  I see anopportunistic  strategy as  one  that would not consciously use monetarypolicy  to push  the  economy below potential  in  order  to  achieve areduction  in  inflation, unless  inflation  initially were significantlyfar  from its  optimal value.  I don't  think the  current inflation raterepresents price  stability.  I believe  the  current  inflation rate istoo high, but  it  is not vastly  too  high.  I would  see an  opportunisticstrategy as  one  that would look for  gains  on  the  inflation frontduring periods  when negative shocks  unavoidably create  slack in theeconomy.  Because  I hold that view, I regard as  quite acceptable fornow what  I think is  currently the most  reasonable  forecast, namely onewhere  output  is  expected to  continue  to  grow at  a trend rate  close tothe  economy's potential  and with no prediction  that  inflation will

MR. D. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will bereferring  to  the Bluebook, starting with the  table  on page 11.[Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions  for Dave?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  A question about velocity:  What  do you think theif  we were  to  raise  the  targets?

[SECTION]

MR. D. LINDSEY.  I don't  think the market's view is  verydifferent  from  that  of  the  Board staff  regarding the reliability  offorecasts  of  velocity.  Market participants  have  not been focusing onthe monetary aggregates.  They essentially have  accepted the  FOMC'sanalysis  that  in  the  1990s  there has been a heightened degree  ofuncertainty regarding velocity behavior.  So,  I don't think they wouldchange their  view of  whether velocity was predictable  or not  if  theCommittee were  to raise the  ranges.  The wording of  the  Committee'sreport and the Chairman's  testimony  surrounding  this  decision couldattempt  to disabuse  them of the  notion  that  we felt  there was  anygreater reliability  to velocity forecasts  than previously.  Judging atleast  from the experience  to  date  for which  they have accepted ouranalysis, we might have a chance  of  persuading them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Actually, I think  this  is pretty much the  samequestion although coming at  it  from  a slightly different direction.What has  our  track record been at  this point during  the  year, or  in

[SECTION]

MR. D. LINDSEY.  It  turns  out that  in  1990,  when the processof very slow growth  of  the  broader aggregates began  and M2  velocitystarted on  its upward march, we were  a bit  slow in  catching up.  Butsubsequently, despite  the uncertainty, we were not too  inaccurate.  Ivividly  remember briefing this  Committee  in May 1993  with a projectionof  1-1/4  percent  for M2  growth through  that  year.  Perhaps  luckily, M2ended up  growing that year  at 1-1/4  percent.  I also know that  lastyear we were quite--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am sorry, who publishes  the  figures?[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. D. LINDSEY.  The transcript  of  this will  be  out  in  fiveyears and I will  be vindicated!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  But  it  is  hard to  find  the  actual  figures  tocompare  them to  the  projections.  We  tried.  It  isn't easy to  do.

[SECTION]

MR. D. LINDSEY.  That's  right.  We  are revising M2  and thatalters  the  comparison.  For 1995,  M2  growth  and nominal GDP growthcame  in almost exactly where we predicted six months  ago when theCommittee  last  visited this  issue,  and that  involved a judgmental1/30-31/96-31-adjustment  on our part  to a model  forecast  that  was predicting muchslower M2 growth,  a forecast  that we essentially did not believe.This year we are closer  to  the model  forecast  in predicting M2  growthof  5-1/4 percent, but we have been  influenced a bit by the  slope ofthe yield curve.  In a way, our judgmental  forecasts  have been betterthan one might have  expected, but  I wouldn't  say that  that  wouldnecessarily argue  for upgrading the role  of  money as  an  intermediatetarget,  or  even as  an  information variable.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I actually was  reacting to  the  idea  that  ifthere  is  a rather wide  range of uncertainty around  these projections,though I gather you don't  think there is,  we may be changing theranges  on the  basis of  projections that  are very uncertain.  It seemsto me that  some  of  your argument for Alternative II  and AlternativeIII  is  that  they encompass  the  growth rates  that you  are projecting.

[SECTION]

MR. D. LINDSEY.  I wouldn't deny that  there  is  a significantrange of  uncertainty around our  forecast  even if  the Greenbook getsthe pattern  of  the macroeconomy more or  less  correct.  I wouldn't wantto  assert that  there  is  not  a pretty big range of  uncertainty that  theCommittee ought  to take  into  account.  But,  as  we tried to  argue inthe  Bluebook, it  seemed  to us  that  any of  the  alternative ranges  couldbe justified  and a reasonable case  constructed even on the  assumptionthat  the aggregates  were not being upgraded.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  certainly true  that David'sability and that  of  others  to  forecast,  say M2,  has  been quite good  inthe  last  few years.  But members  of  the  staff are making  theforecasts,  not  a model.  The models  themselves  have been going offconsiderably because  the velocity of M2  has  risen rapidly, and  sincewe  don't know the  cause  of  that  increase,  the  forecasts have become  ajudgmental  issue.  Despite the  skill  of  our  colleagues in making  thosesorts of  judgments,  it  does  suggest  that  the  add factors  are veryimportant, as  they are  in all  economic  forecasts.  Those who  employadd  factors have  to be  very skillful.  No one  around  this  table  can bethat  skillful  over  time.  The worst  thing we  could do  at  this  stage isto  acquiesce  in  the presumption  that  because David has been so  goodfor  so  long,  he  therefore will  be good  indefinitely in  the  future.[Laughter]  That  would inevitably doom him to  failure!Further questions?  It  is  worthwhile  to  put on  the  table someof  the  issues  that members  raised back in  July when we  specifiedtentative ranges  for 1996.  We were  in an easing mode,  short-term, atthat  time.  There was  a good  deal  of  academic  discussion as  to whetherit  would be  appropriate,  given the  staff  GDP forecast  then, to movethe  ranges up  to  center  them around the  forecast.  No  economist wouldargue  that  that  is  an  inappropriate thing  to  do.  The rationale  thatgoverned us  in not moving  the M2  range  in July was  partly that  doingso would  imply that the  aggregates  had taken  on a greater  importance.But, more  importantly,  it  was the  presumption that we would be movingaway from an M2  range  that we  considered to be  consistent with pricestability over time,  given  a return  of  M2  velocity to  its  earliergrowth trend.  I think  the  general  judgment  of  this  Committee was  thatit  was probably best  to  allow sleeping dogs  to  lie.  For  those  of youwho  address this  issue  today, I would  appreciate that you alsoindicate whether you think that  the  views expressed in July are stillvalid or  ought  to  be altered in  light  of developments  since  then.  Whowould like  to  start off?1/30-31/96-32-

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Are we  talking about just  this  issue?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  I am  sorry.  We are talking aboutthe  broad question with respect  to  ranges  for  the aggregates.  If  youwish  to bring up  other  issues  not related to  this,  I suggest  that youmention  them but  then  set  them aside rather than mix everything  intothis  discussion.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  First  on M2,  Mr. Chairman, we have  a person onour  staff named Yash Mehra who  is  a very good money demand analyst.He has done  some work that  indicates  that  the  leftward shift  in the M2demand  function may be ending  in  the  sense that his  equation predictedthe  actual M2  growth  rate  in  1995  pretty well.  Looking  forward, hisM2  model projection  for  1996  is  4-3/4 percent, which is  a little  lowerthan  the staff  forecast  but  at  least  in  the  same  ballpark.  I wouldagree with the staff  view in  the Bluebook that has  already beenexpressed here this morning.  I think it  is  too  early  to  conclude  thatany permanent relationship has  been reinstated between M2  and nominalGDP.  Last year's  performance could  turn out  to  be a fluke,  and wecould see  the actual growth  rate back down again  in  1996  as  it  returnsto the  slower growth  trend of  the  early  1990s.  In  these  circumstancesI would prefer Alternative I for the  reasons  that you just  suggested,Mr. Chairman.  We have been explaining this growth  rate range  in termsof  our  longer-term price stability objective and  I think  it  would beappropriate  to  continue  to  do  that.  I would add, however,  that  if M2stays  on  track in  1996,  we would need to  review it  at  this  time nextyear.  We may then want  to  consider changing the  way we are using M2and  the  degree  of  emphasis we  give  to  it.I was going  to make  just  a couple  of  comments about  inflationtargeting, Mr. Chairman.  Should I do  that  now or  would you rathercover that  later?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would appreciate  it  if we  could wait.There will be  other Committee members  who will want  to raise  thisissue.  So,  it may be  wise  to  set  that  aside unless  you believe  it  isrelevant to  this particular policy decision.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I see  it  as  an operational  substitute  for  anM2  range.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  are  legally obligated to  make theseprojections.  The drift  of  our previous  discussions on this  issuewould lead  to  the  conclusion that  we want to  do  something different,but  the  law has  to be  changed in  order  for that  to happen.  Let usconclude our  statutorily required discussion before  we move to  thebroader  issues.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Fine.  I prefer Alternative I.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I was going to  say  "Professor" Parry.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you!  Mr. Chairman, I would supportAlternative  I because  I think  the considerations you described thatmotivated our July discussion continue  to  apply today.  It  seems  to  methat we  can't  forecast  velocity reliably.  Therefore,  I think it wouldnot  be advisable  to move  the  ranges  annually based on current1/30-31/96-33-forecasts.  Moreover, raising the ranges  at  this  time  in the cyclewould, in my view, put greater  focus  on the  aggregates,  and I am stillnot confident  that  increased focus  on the  aggregates  is  warranted.Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  In his presentation, Dave  Lindsey mentioned theissue of  the  consistency of  the  central  tendency of  the members' GDPprojections  for  1996 with the  alternative ranges  for  the monetaryaggregates and whether we should move away  from Alternative  I.  Buteven if we  were using the  aggregates as  an  indicator variable of  thethrust of  monetary policy, we would need to know the numbers  for  1997because  there would be lags.  To  be consistent,  we would have to  saythat here  is  the  objective  that  the Committee  is  seeking  and here  isthe monetary policy that would produce  that  result.  If  you took  theGreenbook projection as  the appropriate  forecast  for nominal GDP,  thenyou would have to project velocity and indicate what money growth in1996  is  going to  be consistent with your  objectives  for 1997.  I don'tthink  that we know enough to do  that.  I don't know what  the  staff'sanswer to  that would be  if we  asked.  I don't believe we need to  ask,because  I don't  think we know enough to  say that  it  should bedifferent  from Alternative  I.  So,  the arguments  about  the merits  ofusing Alternatives  II  or  III  simply are  not persuasive to me.  I alsobelieve  that  the  arguments we used last  July were right.  Moreover,  itwould be  difficult  to  tell  Senator Mack or anybody else  that we needto  change  the law  to focus  on  objectives and at  the  same  time  say tohim that,  by  the way, we are  changing the ranges  for  the monetaryaggregates  for  this or  that reason but we  don't  think the ranges  areuseful.  I don't  think  it  is  consistent  to  say that  the  ranges are  notuseful, but  the  law requires us  to set  them  and we are  changing them.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I prefer Alternative  I.  I agree with the staffand  those members who say  it  is  too  early to  know where velocity is  orwhat its  growth rate will  be.  I also think  that  if we  change  theranges now, we will have  things backwards.  If we  are changing thembecause  we  think the  growth rates will  be much higher rather  thanbecause we want to  target  what we think should be higher growth rates,knowing what velocity is,  we  could come up with different  answers.  Idon't think we have enough  information  in  either case,  and I don'tthink that we  should signal  to  anyone that we  do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I prefer Alternative  I.  I think  the argumentsthat were valid last July  are still  valid.  We really don't  have  thatmuch confidence  in  the relationship between money and the economy.Because  of  that,  we are  largely dealing with  symbolism here.  It  isimportant  that we use  that  symbolism  to  underscore our long-runcommitment  to  price stability.  I think that's  what the  current rangesfor  the  aggregates  say, and I think  that's  the way we ought  to  keepit.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.1/30-31/96-34-

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I favor Alternative  I as  well.  I havefelt  strongly  for a long time  that we  really ought  to  set  these rangeson the basis  of  longer-term relationships  and that  it would send a badsignal  to move  them at  this point.  Let me quickly make a couple ofother  observations  in this  regard.  First,  even though money has  notbeen  terribly useful  in  the short  run in terms  of gauging  the  thrustof policy, I don't  think we  can forget  the  fact that  there has  been arelationship in  the long run between  these broader aggregates  and  thebehavior of  inflation.  I would hate  to  think that we  are a centralbank that doesn't  think money matters when we set monetary policy.That would be a scary proposition,  frankly, but  there  is  very littlemention  of money these days.  The other  thing, and this  ties  in withwhat Tom Hoenig said, is  that  if we  start moving the ranges  aroundjust because we are  expecting different monetary growth,  that  ineffect sends  the message  that we are  going to  adjust our monetarytargets  to  accommodate  inflation rather  than using them as a tool  tosend a message  of where we  think  long-term money growth has  to  be  toachieve our  inflation objective.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I agree with all  that  has been said  so  far,which  is  to  let  sleeping dogs  lie.  We would send the wrong signalabout  our long-run resolve  on inflation if  we  tampered with the rangesnow.  The projections are  too uncertain  to  be used as  a basis  forchanging the  ranges  in any event.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  I am afraid I am  the  odd one  out here.  I don'tthink the  monetary aggregates  should, or do, play an  important role  inpolicy.  I certainly don't  think the  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony shouldfocus  on  the aggregates.  I believe  we  should continue, as we  did lastconcerned about  sending  the message that  we have  a commitment  to pricestability, we  ought  to  do  so  in words  and, perhaps  better than that,we ought  to  explain in words how we  intend to  achieve  that  objective.As  I indicated last  July when  I dissented on  this  matter, it  isimportant  to  engage  in honest  communication with  Congress.  To me  thehonest  choices  are  target ranges  that  are centered on the  staff's bestguess  of where  these aggregates will  come out  given  our preferredmonetary policy course, which  should be  related to  the  economicforecast  that we will  be presenting in  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony.In my view, the existence  of  uncertainty does  not change  this.  Yes,velocity is  very uncertain, but  at  a minimum we ought  to  have rangesthat encompass  the staff's best  guess  about what  monetary growth weare going to  end up with under  the preferred policy strategy.  I don'twant to push the  centering  issue  too hard.  My preferred strategy herewould be Alternative III,  but  especially in light  of  David's  argumentabout  opportunistic  strategies  that  I endorse, Alternative  II would beacceptable  to me.  Alternative  I, which does  not even  encompass  thestaff's point  forecast  for M2,  does  not  strike me as  honestcommunication.  Again,  I would  say that  it's  easy to  rationalize  achange as  a technical  adjustment.  We  did this--for M3--in July  andit did not appear  to  create  any reaction whatsoever.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I can understand the  intellectual  attraction ofeither Alternative  II  or  Alternative III.  But  I believe the  reasonthe Humphrey-Hawkins  legislation  requires us  to project the M's  isthat at  the  time  that  legislation was  enacted, the  ranges wereexpected to  be indicators  of  our intended policy and the  future  courseof  the  economy.  We  no longer have  the  faith  that we or  the  economicsprofession had in  the  late  1970s  that  the M's  are directly related tothe future growth  of  the  real  economy.  In  that  regard, what we now dowith the  ranges  is  not governed by forecasts and centered-ranges  asmuch as  by communications.  Over  the years we have moved towardsetting  these ranges  to  communicate  our  long-run  goals, and we havebeen successful  in  terms  of  achieving sustainable economic  growth atever  lower  inflation rates.  So,  I would view the  ranges  as  acommunications vehicle  for expressing  the goals  of monetary policyrather than what they were  intended to be when the  legislation wasenacted.  Accordingly, I would prefer Alternative  I.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  the idea  that  theseranges are mainly a communications device  is  what guides me.  Sincethe Humphrey-Hawkins  report and your  testimony no doubt will  point outthat we  do not  find the  monetary aggregates  to  be a particularlyuseful policy  tool,  adopting Alternative  I, II,  or  III would notresult  in  a strong market  reaction or  great  excitement except perhapsin some  corners of  the  academic community.  However,  at a time  when weare  still  in  an  easing mode--certainly the last move  of the  Committeewill  have been an easing  action, whatever we do  today--I  think usingAlternative  I would best  communicate  our  long-term goal  of  pricestability.  So,  that alternative  is  definitely what  I prefer.  If  themajority of  the Committee  were  to prefer some other  alternative,  thatis  not  something about which  I would get very excited and  I certainlywould not object by dissenting.  But  I think Alternative I conveys  themessage most  reliably.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  In  his briefing, Dave Lindsey indicated  thatthe M2  range  in Alternative  I would be  the  target range  that we wouldhave once we  reached price stability, assuming  that M2  velocityreturned to  its  traditional  trend.  We  don't  have either of  thoseconditions.  At  least  we  can't be  sure about  velocity, and wecertainly have not  reached price stability.  None  of us  to  myknowledge put down  zero as  our  estimate  for  the  GDP deflator or moreprecisely that  real  GDP growth  and nominal  GDP growth are  the  same  inany of  our  forecasts.  In  fact,  I doubt very much whether any of  usput  down less  than 2 percent  for our  expectation of  GDP  deflatorgrowth.  Given that  and given that we  are  not being asked to provideguidelines  for what  we would like  the M2  range to be  in some  futuretime when we  reach price  stability--clearly that won't  happen thisyear  or  in  1997--I  think  the  only honest  thing  to  do  is  to  havesomething  like the  Alternative  II  range  for M2.  At  least  the  staffprojection  indicates that M2  growth is  going  to be within  that range.For  the  Committee to  say  that  our range does not  encompass  expected M2growth either  says  that we don't  control  the aggregates  or that  therange  is  not  consistent with our policy.  So,  I think  the only honestpresentation  is  Alternative  II.  I could vote for Alternative  III,  but1/30-31/96-36-I don't  think that  alternative  is  going  to  be  favored by a largenumber of people.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I favor Alternative I.  When weadopted this  alternative  on a tentative  basis back in July, weindicated that  the M2  range was  going to  serve as  a benchmark for therate of M2  growth  that would be expected under conditions  ofreasonable price stability and historical velocity behavior.  So,  ifwe  repeat  that statement  or words  similar  to  it,  I think we will  becommunicating honestly to  the  Congress  and telling them what ourintention is.  To do  anything else, no matter how articulate you arein explaining our reasons  to  Congress, Mr. Chairman, would be  read byothers as  implying  that  this  Committee  is  placing more weight on  theaggregates  in  our policy decisions.  I don't  think we  are at  thatpoint by any means,  and I would not want the Congress  or  the public  tothink  that we  are.  In my view. a lot  of messages would inadvertentlybe communicated if we were  to change  these ranges.  Clearly,  I wouldfavor Alternative  I at  this point.

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I am quite  attracted to  thearguments  that  Governors Yellen and Lindsey make  and, frankly, ittroubles  me a little to  reject  those and go  for Alternative  I.Nevertheless,  I am choosing Alternative  I for  the simple  reason thatto  change  the  ranges would involve a certain fine-tuning  of  the  dialsthat we don't know that  we want  to  do,  we  don't know that we need todo,  and we don't  even know that we  can do.  As a consequence,  I willstay with Alternative  I.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I will  go with Alternative I and associatemyself with the  comments of  President Moskow and Governor Kelley.  Iwill  say, however,  that  I am uncomfortable  about  not having  thestaff's  expected growth of M2  encompassed by the Alternative I range.As  I recall,  the  staff  forecast in July did at  least have monetarygrowth  at  the upper end of  the ranges  for  last year.  If  we  get  to  amore normal  relationship between GDP and the monetary aggregates, weshould  take a hard look at  changing  the  ranges.  But because  changingthe  ranges  at  this point would signal more knowledge than we actuallyhave,  I think it  is  best  to  stay with Alternative I for now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I think most  of  the relevant points  have beenmade.  It  seems  to me  that we  can't have  it  both ways.  The  issue  is1/30-31/96-37-what  we want to  communicate.  Do  we want  to  set  up ranges consistentwith  the baseline Greenbook forecast or do we want  to  set  up rangesconsistent with our  long-run,  low inflation  objective?  I prefer  thelatter,  which is  Alternative I.  It  also  seems to me  that,  puttingDave Lindsey's magic  aside,  any rigorous  confidence  interval  around amodel-based M2  or M3  forecast  is  going  to be  quite wide;  it probablyis  going  to  encompass all  of  these  ranges.  So,  I don't  see  it  as  allthat big a deal  even statistically.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The consensus  clearly is  for AlternativeI and  I assume that  in making that  choice, you are accepting 1 to  5percent  on M2,  2 to  6 percent  on M3,  and 3 to 7 percent on debt.  Irequest  that  the  Secretary call  the  roll.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, let's  now go  on  to  the broaderquestion that a number  of  you have raised.  President Broaddus, wouldyou like  to start  us  on  this?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Although retainingthe  M2  target range  of  1 to  5 percent gives a signal  of  our  longer-term objectives, my own view is  that we  need something more  than  thatto  communicate fully  to the  public and  the markets.  I think it  wouldbe very desirable  to  supplement  our monetary targets with some  kind ofexplicit inflation objective  now, and that  could be set  for any timeperiod that  the Committee  agreed on.  I would suggest that  the 1996-1997  two-year period might be  the appropriate  time  frame.  I think thecurrent  short-term policy situation presents an  especially usefulopportunity to  do  this.  As  we all  know, sluggishness  in  the economyhas  a lot  of  folks  saying that we  should ease our  short-term policystance now.  A reasonable case  can certainly be  made  for  that.  I amnot making that case,  but  it  can be made.  With the  economy operatingsomewhere in  the neighborhood of  the NAIRU--even recognizing the1/30-31/96-38-uncertainty you mentioned yesterday, Janet--there  is  a real  risk thatreducing the  funds  rate  now or  in  the near  future  could raise doubtsin some corners  about  the  strength of  our commitment  to  our longer-term price  stability goals,  at  least  relative to  other policyobjectives we might have.  As  I argued last summer,  and I recallothers  did as  well,  I would certainly hope  that Congress at  some pointwill  give  us  an explicit  longer-term price  stability mandate.  TheMack legislation would do  that,  but it  doesn't  look as  if  the MackBill  is  likely to pass  the Congress any time  in  the  foreseeablefuture.  With that  in mind, I think we  should  consider confirming ourcommitment  to price  stability in  some  explicit way now.  There are  alot  of ways  that  this  could be  done.  Tom Melzer mentioned a coupleyesterday.My own suggestion would be  that we  include  in  the Humphrey-Hawkins written report and hopefully  in your  testimony, Mr. Chairman,a positive statement  that  the Committee wants and expects  the CPIinflation rate to  remain below 3 percent  on average  over  the  two-year1996-1997 period and that beyond  that we  intend  to  take  steps  to  bringthe  inflation rate down  further  over time.  We  could think of this,and describe  this publicly, as  a sort  of benchmark.  That  would be  theterm I would use.  Such  a benchmark would give  the Congress and thepublic, and  for that matter ourselves,  something more concrete  than wehave had in the past  to  hold ourselves accountable  for.  It may seemlike a small  step,  but  I think this would be a significant departurefrom what we  have done  in  the past.  I believe  it  would get someattention and hopefully improve  our credibility along with  ouraccountability.  If  we were to  agree  to  do  something like  this  and ifit  would make the Committee more comfortable, we  could add a statementin the report  that  a benchmark like  this  would not necessarilyconstrain us  in dealing with  short-term ups  and downs in  the  economy.It  would not  constrain us  or prevent  us  from  continuing to  takeactions  that are  aimed at  stabilizing  employment and output  in  theshort  run.  I think  it  would make us  evaluate  such short-term actionsagainst our longer-term price  stability  objective  rather thanevaluating efforts  to  contain inflation against  an  implicitunemployment  objective, which I think has  been the  case in  some pastyears.  Again,  this  may appear  to be a small  step, but  I think itwould be  a step  in  the right  direction.  It  would get  some  attention,and  it would raise  the  chances  that we would ultimately get to wherewe are  trying  to go.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can I ask you why you believe  that theMack Bill  is  not going anywhere?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I am not on  top  of  the  latest developments,but  in general  it  seems unlikely to me that  the bill  is  going to pass.From what  I understand, there  is  some chance  that  it won't pass at  allin this Congress.  I may be misjudging that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think that's much too premature.  Theissue has not  been  joined, and there  is  a large number  of  cosponsorson  the Republican  side.  What  that all means  is hard  to  say.  You maywell be  right.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Even  if  I am wrong on that,  Mr. Chairman,  Idon't think that  would change my view about  the desirability of  doingsomething  like this.1/30-31/96-39-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think it  does  in part  change  the viewof  where we  ought  to be moving because  I am not  certain it  is  to  ouradvantage  to  do  something in  advance  of what  that bill will do.  Inother words,  that may not help  the  particular form  of  the  discussionsthat we  are  involved in.  But  I think we will  find  out within the nexttwo  or three weeks  because  they have  to make a move one way or  theother  in  that regard.  Well, maybe not in  two  or  three weeks--two  orthree months may be  the more relevant time  frame.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I am attracted to  President  Broaddus'sargument.  I think that  communication of intent by the  central bankdoes aid in  raising its  credibility,  though  I question whether wereally have  a credibility problem at  present.  Does  anybody reallybelieve  the  stuff  that  Don Kohn put  in  the Bluebook?  [Laughter]Moving  from 3 percent  to  1 percent  inflation by the year  2002  resultsin a full  8 percentage point  loss  of  economic growth  in this period.If  nobody believes  that,  that's fine.  But  if  one believes even aportion of  that,  it  strikes  me  that  it's  a political  decision to  giveup economic  growth to  achieve  that decline  in  inflation, and thatstrikes me  as  an even greater reason  to wait  for the Mack Bill.

MR. BROADDUS.  I sense that!

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I think part of your proposal included aguideline  for  1996.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I was  thinking  of  a two-year period, 1996-97,as  a time frame,  but  the  time frame  is  not a particular issue  for me.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  My question  is,  if monetary policy exerts  itsimpact with a lag, whether we  are currently in a position to  doanything  to affect  1996  beyond  events  that are  already in  train  orpolicies  that  have  already been implemented.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  A  longer  time  frame would probably be moreappropriate  given the  lags,  Mike, and that's why I said 1996-1997.Again, I am not  talking about  trying to  control  the  inflation  rate  inany mechanical  way;  we  can't do  that.  I am  simply saying that wewould make a statement that  we would evaluate all  of  our short-termpolicy actions over  this period of  time--especially those  in  the nearterm where the  lag  is  long  enough presumably to have  some effect  onthe  inflation  rate during the  two-year period--in a way that  wouldbias  the  outcome  toward  this  result.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I am going to  be very disappointed if  we don'tachieve your guideline  in  1996,  and I have  some  confidence  that wewill.  But  I  think  that will  be a result  of  developments and policesthat  are  already  in  train.1/30-31/96-40-

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Still,  making it  explicit  in this way imposesdiscipline.  It  adds  a degree  of  credibility and accountability that  Ithink we  don't have  now.  It would move us  a step  forward.  I don'tthink it's  revolutionary.  It will never  solve all  our problems, putit's a step  in  the right  direction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  It will  be a long  time,  if  ever, before aconsensus  emerges about  the  success  or  failure of  monetary targetingover  the  last  20  years  or  so.  As  far as  I am aware,  of all  of  thecentral  banks around  the world that  have experimented with monetarytargeting only the  Deutsche Bundesbank continues  to  do  so  andcontinues  to  argue  that  it  has been successful.  It  does  continue tobe  successful  and German economists outside  the  Bundesbank also arguethat way.  While  this would be  considered heresy by some  of myprofessional  friends,  I think even  in the  case  of  the Bundesbank thatmonetary targeting was neither necessary nor sufficient  for achievingthe results  that  they obtained over  a period of  time.  What happenedto  the Federal  Reserve was that monetary targeting was  imposed on anunwilling central bank  in  1975  and then  again  in  legislation in  1978,whereas  the  Bundesbank adopted monetary targeting  as a means  toachieve a very clear,  single objective.  There was  some  help for theBundesbank  from enabling legislation.  The  Federal  Reserve did nothave  that  sort  of help,  nor did the  Bank of England,  the Bank ofCanada,  and so  on.  I think that  a central bank that  adopts  a veryclear,  single objective  for  price stability has more  freedom toformulate  its  policy and achieve  that  objective.  On the  other hand,one  that uses  something like monetary aggregates ranges  as  amonitoring device  or  as  a communications device without  a clearobjective  is  going to have political problems  and even problems  informulating policy.  I think the most  important  thing is  to  emphasizeclearly  the  single  objective  of price  stability and to  lay that outinto  the  future.  It  has  to be  a multiyear objective.  I think  it'sbetter  if  it  comes  from within  the  organization.  Yesterday, ViceChairman McDonough mentioned the  transition cost problems,  but wedon't know what  those  transition cost  problems are because of  theissue of  credibility.  Nobody else  can really estimate them  either.With  regard to  the numbers  in  the Bluebook to which Cathy referred,Don Kohn is  quite clear in  saying that  they take  no account  ofimproving  credibility.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That's right.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  If we  can  enhance  our own position, not onlywith  regard to  the Congress but  with regard to  the American public, byvery clearly articulating and setting out  a time path  for  achievingprice  stability and if--a big  if--that is  credible and people  reallybelieve we will  deliver  on  it,  we will minimize  the  transition costsof  lost output.  As  I said last year, I still worry about  futureCongressional hearings.  The very well  known, well  respected membersof  our profession will  focus  more  than I would  like  on the  transitioncost  argument--on lost  output and how many people will be  thrown outof  a job in  order to  achieve the  price stability  objective.  That willdistract from the  underlying  issue  that achieving price stability isgrowth-enhancing;  it  raises standards  of  living.  That's  why we  aretrying  to do  it.  I would rather see  this  Committee  say, with orwithout  the  Mack legislation, that  we have adopted a single objective1/30-31/96-41-and that  it  is  a way of  achieving the  objectives of  the  FullEmployment Act.  I am not even  sure  that requires  legislation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I have expressed my views on this  topicbefore,  and as  you know I think we  ought to be  moving in  the  directionof  setting  longer-term  inflation targets.  I would not disagree withwhat  you said before about  the Mack legislation.  I do  not have anyinformation that  would suggest  that  the  prospects  for passage  of  thelegislation really have been tested, and I can  see the merits  ofwaiting to  see what will happen  to  the  legislation.  However,  if  wewere to  approach the  July meeting with nothing happening and our  sensewas  that  the  legislation was not  going anywhere,  then  I think we oughtto  be considering what  steps we could take on  our  own withoutlegislation.  Their purpose would be to  convey more clearly ourlonger-term  objectives  and, as  Al  said, increase  our  credibility andaccountability.As  I mentioned yesterday, one  step that  could be  taken  inthat  regard, short  of  actually setting a target, would be  to  extendour horizon with respect  to  inflation  forecasts.  It's  ironic  that  theCBO and OMB put out budget  projections with  inflation  assumptionsgoing out  five years.  They are assuming 3 percent  inflation  over thathorizon.  In my view, those projections  generally  tend to have animpact on  longer-term  inflation expectations,  and the very agency thatactually influences  inflation  over  time doesn't have  anything to  sayabout it.  Obviously, one  could take  this  to  the point where  aprojection becomes  a target.  There  certainly is  a relationship.  Wewould have  to  think very carefully about what we were doing,  but  Iwould not  see any real  problem or any impediment  to a decision by thisCommittee  to provide  forecasts  over  a longer  time  horizon.  If we wereforecasting  inflation two  or three years  out, people would realizethat  that  is  a time horizon  over which we could have  some  influence,and  there might be  an  expectation that  we would deliver  on  that.To pick up on  Cathy's point,  and Jerry touched on  this  alittle,  I don't put  much faith in model projections  of  inflation.Part of  the reason is  that  they do not  take credibility  into  account.Nonetheless,  I found it  interesting  to  look  at  the model results  inthe Bluebook.  I was  fascinated with the  examples  where it  was  assumedthat  shocks  raised the  equilibrium funds  rate by  50  basis points.  Theconclusion, or  the underlying assumption, was  that  a current  andfuture  funds  rate  of  5-1/2  percent was  consistent with 3 percentinflation in  the  long run.  One  could argue  that  easing the  funds  ratetoday would be analytically  equivalent to  the example  in  the Bluebookof  an upward shock  in  the  equilibrium funds  rate  of,  say, 50  basispoints.  I am not  suggesting that  anybody who favors  some  easing hasthat  in mind.  What  is  very interesting, if  one believes the modeloutput, is  that  reducing the  funds  rate  does  not really put one  in  anopportunistic  school, which  is where  I think people who would tend tofavor  that policy course would be  likely to  place themselves.  Rather,it  actually places  them  in a deliberate camp  to  raise inflation.  Theeffect  in that  example, where  the real  equilibrium  funds  rate  isshocked,  is  to drive the  inflation rate higher;  it  continues  to risefor  three years,  albeit not by a lot.  It  does not  rise  above 4percent  in  that particular model.1/30-31/96-42-We have  been at  3 percent  inflation for roughly  the  last  fouryears.  It  is  only recently that  financial markets have been willingto  give us  enough credibility so  that,  in looking at  longer-termrates,  they build in  a premium  for  inflation and inflation uncertaintythat  has been reduced to  somewhere around the  current  inflation rate.It has  taken us  four years  to  achieve  that  degree  of  credibility.  SoI see  a policy easing move  in terms  of  taking an action  that  isdeliberate in the  sense of  forcing the  inflation rate  up.  I know allthings would not be  the  same, but  the  Bluebook model  suggests thatconceivably we  could be  looking at  rising inflation  for  three years.If we keep  inflation at  the higher  level  for  a further  three years, wewill have  lost  a tremendous amount  of  time  in  this process  of  tryingto gain  inflation credibility.  So,  I thought  the Bluebook exercisewas useful  from  that perspective,  at  least  for  those who would putweight  on  these models.  As I said, I tend not  to look at  them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think credibility  is  earned by what we do,  notwhat we say.  We lost  credibility by letting inflation accelerate,  andwe have  regained a lot  of  credibility by bringing inflation down.Over the  last  15  years,  we  have brought  inflation  down from double-digit  levels.  We held inflation  to  an average of  4 percent during  thelong expansion of  the  1980s.  We have held it  to  3 percent  or underduring the  fairly lengthy expansion of  the  1990s.  The actions  that wetook  in  1994,  when we  tightened  in a preemptive way in  trying to headoff  inflationary pressures before  they  emerged, were worth far morethan  anything that we might  say.  I think we really fool  ourselves  ifwe  think that we  can put out statements  that will  enhance ourcredibility.  What counts  is  what people  do,  and there  is  a lag  inas  they have been  since  the  late  1960s,  and I think  that  is  based onactions, not words.  We have put  out words.  The Chairman hasrepeatedly said in his Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony and in  otherspeeches  that we  intend to  preserve the  gains  that we have made oninflation and to  extend them over time.  If  Congress wants  to pass  theMack Bill,  so be  it;  that  could be helpful.  But  I don't think weought  to  engage  in  legislation around  this  table.  What we  can do  andwhat  the  legislation gives us  the power  to  do  is  to  act.  That  is  whatwe ought  to  do and save the words  for  the  legislature and for  otheravenues  as we  have done  in  the past.

In  the meantime,having something like  the wording  that President Broaddus  suggestedmight be  useful.  One never knows.  It might even  reduce  theprobability that we would ease at a time when we  as  a group  expect  theeconomy to  grow at  a rate  in excess  of  that  of potential.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I would like  to associate myself  toan absolute degree with Ed Boehne's remarks.  I believe  that  thedegree of  credibility that we  enjoy at  the moment has  been hardearned, but  it  is  very high.  I don't  know of  anybody--even  in the1/30-31/96-43-world's  capital  of cynics, New York  City--who really believes  thatthis  Committee  is  not  absolutely resolute  in  the pursuit  of pricestability.  I think that,  as  Ed suggested, we are better  off  tocontinue  as  a Committee performing with deeds, with good solid,sensible,  anticipatory monetary policy.  As  for words,  I for  one havebeen giving a number of  speeches  recently to  groups  like  the NationalMortgage Bankers  in which I state as  firmly as  I can  that  my wholeview of  monetary policy is  that price stability  is  the  means by whichwe  achieve  sustained economic  growth.  Therefore,  I don't  really needa change  in  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  legislation.  To me,  that  legislationis  not  in  fact contradictory.  It  says  that we want  sustained economicgrowth and we want price  stability.  I think they are  the same  goalbecause  sustained economic growth  is  achieved through price  stability.By  speaking out publicly, one of  the  things we  can do--and  it  is  arole that  I have  taken on myself--is  to  confront  the  traditional  anti-price  stability group  by reversing their argument.  The reason verysensible people  have been  against price stability  is  that  they believeit  is  socially and politically harmful  to  the poor whom they  feel  theyrepresent.  I think they have  it  absolutely backwards.  I believe  thebest  thing  for  the poor in the  South Bronx  is price  stability.  I haveargued  that,  and believe  it  or  not,  some of  the people  who have beenmost vocal  over  time as  attackers  of price  stability sort  ofbegrudgingly  tell  me  that I may have  it  right.I am very much in  favor  of  a Mack Bill because  I thinkformally establishing price stability as  a goal  of  the  Federal  Reserveis  a major political  judgment.  Major political  judgments  should bemade by Congress with the  agreement  of  the  President.  In my view,  itwould be very much in  the national  interest  to have  the  Mack Bill  orsomething very much like  the  Mack Bill  enacted into  law.  So,  as  anindividual  and as  the President  of  the Federal  Reserve Bank of NewYork, I have publicly stated that  the Mack Bill  is  a very  good idea.I am not  endorsing all  its  details;  it's  too early  for  that.  Butrather  I think that  legislation  establishing a single goal  for  theFederal  Reserve has  great merit.  That  is what  the Congress  and thePresident  are  for,  and we would be ill-advised  in  the meantime, as  theChairman suggested, to preempt  that debate and  in  a way make  itunnecessary.  The whole history of  this  country  is  that  the  FederalReserve  does  its  job best  when we are carrying out  what  the  Americanpeople want us  to  carry out.  Over  time we have brought  this  issue  toa point where the American people as  represented in  the  Congress arereally in  agreement  that price stability  is  what makes sense.  Weshould let  that  political process  take place.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have some  sympathyfor Al  Broaddus's  suggestion.  It  would be a small  step  toward helpingus  achieve  our ultimate objective, which I view as maximizing  livingstandards.  Price stability  is  the means  that we  have at  our disposalto achieve  that.  Having said  that,  I think Al's  suggestion,  like alot  of  relatively provocative  ideas, raises  at  least  as many questionsas  it  addresses.  For example,  if  we were to go  down  this path, whatare  the  right numbers?  Is  this  going to  have any operationalsignificance?  If  it  does,  don't we  have  to worry  about instrumentinstability and maybe economic  instability as we  start  to  implementthis?  So,  there  are a lot  of  things  we would have  to  think through  in1/30-31/96-44-a serious way  if we  are going to  do  something like  this,  at  least  forme  to be  comfortable with it.In  terms  of  trade-offs  and loss  functions  in  some  of  thosenumbers  that are  in  the Bluebook, I certainly don't  take  those numbersat  face value, but  I question how big the  credibility effects may be.I think the burden of  proof is  really on  those  of us who  think that wecan make further progress toward price  stability without  some short-term loss  in the rate  of  economic growth.  I say that based oneconomic history.  I am not  aware of  periods  in  this  country where wehave made progress toward price  stability without some episodes ofsubpar growth.  One could counter  that  by asserting  that ourcredibility was  relatively low.  That may be, but  it  seems  to me  theburden of proof,  based on history,  is  still  on  those who want  to  arguethat we can do  this without  some  short-term loss  of  growth.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I think most  of  the people whoplan  for  the  future  try to  do  so with a goal  in mind.  They  shouldstate  that  goal,  and  I think such a statement can serve very well.  Ifavor the  idea  of  having a price  stability goal  because pricestability does  achieve  all  those objectives  that we  talk about.Having a stated goal  is  a form of  discipline that  is  especially usefulduring difficult  times  when  it  is  easier  to drift  away from  it.  Thecaveat that  I have is  similar  to Bill McDonough's.  I think  if we wereto  do  that,  it would have  to be done  very carefully within  the contextof  Humphrey-Hawkins because  that's  the  law of  the  land.  We  have  to beconsistent with  that  law not  only in  substance, which we may be  ableto  do by setting the  goal,  but  also  in  appearance.  There  is  a debategoing on in  the Congress  right now.  I would like  to  get us  to  thepoint where we have  this goal,  but  I think we ought  to  let  the  debateplay out.  If we  do adopt  a goal  in  the  interim, we  should couch  it  interms  that  are very clearly consistent with Humphrey-Hawkins.

I would suggest  that  Julymight be  the  right  time,  though, to  consider doing something  likethat.  By waiting until July, we will  know more  about whether the MackBill  is  being debated, about  its  chances, and whether we would bemaking such an  announcement  in  the middle of a recession.  Also, doingit  in July might mean that we could shift  the  time  frame  to  somethinglike  1997-1998  and at  least partially get  around the  lag  issue  thatGovernor Kelley raised.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  As  I have  said previously, I am quite  sympa-thetic  to  the  communications goals  embodied in  the Mack proposal.  Forthe  same reasons,  I am attracted to many of  the arguments  thatPresident Broaddus has  presented, although I certainly agree with GaryStern on the  issue  of  credibility.  I think we  could proceed tocommunicate more  even without legislation.  Whatever happens  to  theMack Bill,  I think it  is  desirable  to  work toward  that end.  In  thatsense,  I agree with Al.1/30-31/96-45-The problem  from my standpoint  is  that before we  communicate,we really need more extensive debate  and  study of  exactly what  we wantto  communicate.  I do  not know precisely what members of  thisCommittee mean when they use the words  "price stability."  I don'tknow  if  they mean  literally  0 or  1 percent  inflation  or a range of  1to  2 percent.  Also,  I don't  know if we  are talking about  targetingthe price  level  so  that we would expect  the  level  of prices  to  be thesame 100  years  from now as  it  is  today.  That  is  a very differentthing from  targeting zero  inflation and  then forgiving mistakes.  Itis  very clear that the  costs  of  elevated inflation  are high, and, inthat  case, we need to move inflation down  to  lower rates,  and that aconsensus  exists  to do  it.  But  as we get  to  lower rates  of  inflation,we  need to  think much more carefully about  the costs  and benefits ofmoving to  still  lower  rates.  There are benefits,  but during my timeon  the Committee, we never really have  talked about what  the benefitsare  or  attempted  to  evaluate  them concretely.  I believe  there alsoare costs  of moving to  very low inflation rates.  I am persuaded thatthere  is  at  least a significant  one-time output  loss.  There also  maybe  a further permanent  loss  that  occurs because  a little  inflation,particularly  in an economy with slow productivity growth, greases  thewheels  and makes  relative wage  adjustments  easier and may facilitateintersectoral  allocations of  labor.  This  is  a subtle point, but  Ithink we never have evaluated or  tried to measure  it.So,  I think we  are not quite ready  to proceed without  afurther discussion.  Also, we need to  think through what  type  ofstrategy is  appropriate to reach  the  target.  Al  and I have previouslydebated  this.  Inflexible inflation  targets don't  strike me  as  a goodstrategy.  I think there  is  a flexible approach  that would  takeaccount  of  trade-offs  between active  stabilization and inflationobjectives,  but we have never really worked this  through  as  fully aswe  ought  to.  So,  I believe  in  communication, but  I have  some  qualms.We need further study.  At  the end of the day,  though,  I thoroughlyendorse Al's  concrete suggestion  that we  should,  at  a minimum, becommunicating a strong  commitment  to holding  the  line  on  inflation  at3 percent  to  keep  it  from rising higher.  To me,  an opportunisticstrategy would do precisely that.  It  would lean quite hard againstany  increase  in  inflation and it would look for  opportunities  to  bringit  down.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I, too,  think it's  important  for us  tocommunicate more about  the  importance  of price stability as  a goal,and  I must  say I am sympathetic  to Al's proposal.  I do have  somecaveats  and concerns about  the  timing of  implementing such a proposal.Like  President McTeer and others,  I am a little  concerned that now maybe  a bit early.  I would like  to  have  the proposal  fleshed out  alittle more before  I have  to  vote on it.  Among other things,  I thinkwe  ought  to  give more  consideration to  the  appropriate  time horizon.The  1996-1997  time  frame  that Al mentioned makes me  a little nervous.I would prefer a longer horizon.  President Melzer's suggestion oflooking  at what inflation might be doing over  the next  five yearswould  seem to be  a useful kind of  communication.  In  sum, while Iwould like  to  do  something involving more  communication, I would  liketo  have proposals  like  Al's  fleshed out  a little more  and also  to havethe  opportunity to  consider some different  alternatives  as  to what weshould communicate.1/30-31/96-46-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I have been here  only a year andfive months,  but  I think we  have discussed this  question at  least  fouror  five times  [Laughter]  in  that period.  Some  of the discussions  havebeen very good, and  this  one clearly  is  in that  category.  Al'ssuggestion has  some very attractive aspects  to  it  in my view.  Anumber of people have pointed out  some implementation problems,potential  operational  problems, and some measurement issues.  What  arethe  costs, what are  the benefits and, as  Gary Stern mentioned, can wereally identify what  the benefits of  increased  credibility would be?Given the  discussions  of  the Mack Bill,  I think this  clearly would bean inappropriate  time  for  us  to  do anything on  this.  But  the biggerquestion is  what do we  do over  the longer  term.  Like GovernorPhillips,  I think it would be helpful  to  have  some staff work done  toflesh  out  some of  these  longer-term issues  to  see  if we can measure  ina better way some  of  the costs  and benefits and whether we can get  alittle more  specific about what we are  trying to  communicate  and howthat might  differ  from what  we are  communicating now.  We  clearly aredoing a lot  of  communicating now.  Some of  it,  as  President McDonoughsaid, is very useful.  So,  I think it  certainly would help us  as  aCommittee  to have  some focused  staff work done  on  this  for  our nextdiscussion so  that we could understand some of  the  issues  a lot betterbefore we make a decision.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me raise  the very specific  issuethat  Governor Yellen mentioned with respect  to  the possible benefitsof  a low rate of  inflation  in  terms  of  "greasing the wheels" tofacilitate wage adjustments.  As  I recall,  the  staff  did some work onthat  a couple of  years ago  in which the  distribution of wage  increaseswas plotted  to  see whether  the existence  of  the  zero  limitsignificantly constrained the  shape of  the  distribution.  As  I recall,the results  of  that  study were  that  it  did not.  But  I also  have  seenother studies  since  then that  have raised  questions about  this  result.I think that,  to  a large  extent, this  sort of  thing can be  factuallyevaluated.  It would be useful  if we had some  better  insights into  it.I am curious:  Since  that  study was  made, what has been the  specificacademic  literature regarding  the notion of  slight  levels  of  inflationgreasing the wheels  of wage bargaining?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  There have been a few studies  in addition  toours.  We  found some minimal  evidence that there was  some downwardnominal  wage rigidity.  But  the  important  empirical point we wereattempting to make was  that  it  did not appear to be  quantitativelyvery significant.  Other researchers using the  same data  set and  otherdata  sets  also have  found some  evidence of  downward nominal wagerigidity.  Some people put different  spins  on it  in  terms  of how muchor  how little, but  I don't believe  there have been any majorbreakthroughs.  The additional  amounts  of  empirical  evidence have beenrigidity.  The issue  is  how quantitatively significant  ought that  tobe  in the  conduct  of monetary policy.  In  our study, we  found thatthere was  still  significant downward nominal wage  flexibility.  Therewas  some evidence that  at  zero  inflation  there would be  some downwardnominal wage  rigidity.  But  the welfare  loss  of  running a low or  zeroinflation policy that would be  associated with that  downward nominalwage rigidity was not quantitatively significant.1/30-31/96-47-

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Mr. Chairman, I would  like to  broaden  this  alittle.  We did undertake  a Systemwide research effort not very longago.  I don't  think there  have been major breakthroughs  in  theeconomics profession in  the  last  couple  of years  that would greatlychange the picture.  The picture was  that  one could not  come up withdefinitive,  compelling evidence that  could override people's priors,and  their policy judgments  in a broader context,  about how they shouldview the  value of officially  setting our  sights  on moving  theinflation rate  down from 3 percent  to price  stability.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Where were  their priors  coming  from,evidence or nonevidence?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I am not  talking about  the priors  of  theseresearchers, which may have varied.  What we  found was  that it  wasvery hard to  pin these things down.  It  was very hard to getdefinitive,  empirical measures  of  the costs  and benefits of varyinginflation between 3 percent and,  say,  1 percent as  measured by theCPI.  So,  I don't think we  are going to  be able  to  solve  theCommittee's problem through another  intense research effort.  You aregoing to be  confronted with what  economists  normally provide,something  that leaves  some  considerable room to maneuver.  You aregoing to have  to confront this  issue mainly on  other grounds at  thispoint.  The profession does not have  the  tools  to ascertain  the costsof moving  the  inflation rate by 2 percentage points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mean economists  are  truly two-handed!  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  On the question of  the greasing-the-wheelsargument,  I have read the  staff paper.  It  is  a very good paper, but Ithink there are methodological  questions  that  remain open anddifferent ways  of approaching it.  I understand the empirical  findingsthat you have, and I would not  regard them as definitive.  This  isprobably not  the  right place to  get  into methodological  issues, but ifyou  want just  a bit more on this  question,  I would point  to  anentirely different  type  of  study that  doesn't use  longitudinal  datasets.  Truman Bewley from Yale  has  spent several years  interviewingmanagers  and human resources people  at several hundred  firms  in theNew England area  to  try to  understand their wage-setting policies.  Heis  in  the process  of writing a book summarizing what he  found.  Hegave a seminar here not long ago,  and I think it would be fair  to  saythat  the  bottom line  conclusion  is  that wage rigidity stems  from  thefact  that  firms  find  it  extraordinarily difficult  to  cut wages.  Thisis  the unanimous  finding  of his  several years of  interviews.  That  iswhat people say.  It's  not that wage cuts  never occur, but  it  is  avery serious constraint  on what  firms  feel  themselves  capable ofdoing.  That  is  a different kind  of evidence  on this  issue,  but  it  isan empirical  question as  you have  indicated.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Although I have  read it,  I didn't  feel  qualifiedto evaluate it.  It  rested very heavily  on the  tax system and theinteraction  of  inflation with the way capital  income is  taxed and  theresulting distortions  to  asset accumulation and savings by householdsthrough this.  It  was a study  that was  looking at welfare  lossescharacterized by some  sort  of  four-sided figures,  trapezoids orsomething.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Trapezoids.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right, under the  curve.  There were a couple  ofcomments at  the  conference,  as  I think I indicated in my notes.  Oneof  them was  by somebody who  approached the  subject  in an  entirelydifferent way, with a general  equilibrium model,  and he  foundsomething that was  roughly comparable to  Feldstein's  findings.  Butthat was  very theoretical  and abstract.  Some  other people had doubtsabout  the  extent of  the welfare findings.  One  commentator, BenFriedman, noted  that  the  findings of  most of  the  loss  of  welfaredepended on the  interest  elasticity of  saving by households--that  is,that  the  after-tax rate of  return really did affect  how theyaccumulated assets.  As you know, that  is  an open question.  Judgingfrom what  I heard at  the  conference--Larry Lindsey and Mike Moskowwere there  as well  and I don't  know whether they would disagree--itwas  a suggestive  approach but not definitive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  As  I listened  to Dave  Stockton's remarks  aboutdownward wage rigidity, I was  struck by how odd that  sounds  in  thecontext  of  the  last couple  of  years when people around  this  table  andelsewhere  have been puzzling over upward wage  rigidity.  Why haven'twages been  rising more rapidly  in  the  environment  that  we have beenin?  The question, which doesn't  really need to  be answered but needsto be  thought about,  is whether  the rigidity is  symmetrical  or not.The  inference has been  that an  asymmetry is  involved but  that  is  notat  all obvious.On the  issue  of  symmetry and credibility, a simpleinterpretation of  the  Bluebook would be  that  if we were  to  set  anobjective of  raising  the  inflation rate  to  5 percent, we  couldincrease nominal  GDP by 8 percent.  If  we were to  take  that proposalup  to Capitol  Hill,  some people  there probably would say,  "go for  it."Does  anybody around this  table  believe  that,  if we  established apolicy of  raising the  inflation rate and announced a policy of  raisingit  to  5 percent, we would increase GDP?  Well,  of  course  not.  If  therigidity is  symmetrical, that  also  says  something about  the  costs ofgetting to  lower  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You are raising an  interesting issuewith respect  to  the most  recent period.  If  you have downward wagerigidity in a period of  falling inflation rates,  one would presumethat profit margins would be  falling.  However, profit margins  arewidening.  Average wage increases  are admittedly quite  small  at thisstage, and there is  evidence of  significant  downside rigidity on  theleft  side  of  the  distribution curve of wage changes  that does not  seemto be  consistent with  the associated distribution  of  gross profitwould be  incumbent upon us  to  make a judgment  as  to  what type  of1/30-31/96-49-underlying process  we are  dealing with.  There  are  a lot  of  reasonswhy wage  increases  are low.  At our  last meeting  and at previousmeetings,  I raised the  issue of  job  insecurity and the  trade-off  ofwages against  insecurity as  an explanation of  the  low wage  gains.  Wehave in  that  a phenomenon that  actually does explain  in  some  detailwhat  is  going on.  What  it  does not address,  however,  is whether  infact  there  is  wage rigidity involved in  this.  Indeed, if  there  isrigidity, is  that damping  the bottom side  of  the  distribution in  thesense  that with  the  averages  falling,  are we  in  fact getting  anarrowing of  the  distribution  that would be  consistent with therigidity argument?  The  evidence here  is  that we  do not  as  yet know,but  it's not as  though those  data are not  available;  they are.  Itshould be  a question of whether  there  is  significant  flexibilitybetween  0 and 3 percent  inflation  in  the  same way that we know thereis  between 5 and  10  percent.  I think the broad macroeconometricevaluations of  the  sacrifice  ratio or  related concepts are veryinteresting, but  they  are only  suggestive.  Until we  get  to  theinternal  structure  of  the  system, I don't  think we  really will knowwhat  the true  economic  relationships are.  Having  said that,  I am noteven sure  that one can  argue  that  if we  found them  that we  couldtherefore  stipulate that  they are hardened into  the system andirrevocably unchangeable  in  the  period ahead.  So,  even there we  areat  something of  a loss.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I want to  follow up on  something  else  thatJerry Jordan  said, which  I thought was  very good.  His examplereferred to  an announcement  of  an  increase  in the  inflation rate  to  5percent.  In fact,  I think we went  through this  exercise about  a yearago.  The  staff model  did not have an  announcement of  an  increase inthe  inflation rate, but  it  indicated that  increased  inflation  itselfwould raise  real GDP.  In  fact,  higher  inflation in  the model raisesthe  present value  of  future GDP.  I don't  agree with that  conclusion,but  I have  to believe  that  if  we were  to  announce higher inflation,the  increase in GDP would be  less  than it  would be  if we slippedhigher  inflation  in  there.  That  has  to  be true.  So, why wouldn't webelieve  the reverse?  Why wouldn't we  believe  that  if  inflation wereto  go  down  that  we wouldn't  have the  same  improvement  in the  trade-off?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think that's  true  in concept.  The problem, asPresident  Stern and others  have noted, is  finding it  in  the  realworld.  That  is,  when we  look at  sacrifice  ratios across  countriesthat have  inflation  targets  and others  that don't, we can't  find animprovement  there.  Now, there  are a lot  of  other things  going on inthose  countries and  that  doesn't mean that  there  would not be  someimprovement  in the United States,  but  researchers  also had troublefinding  improvements  in  sacrifice  ratios  going from  the 1970s  to  the1980s  after  the huge disinflation we had and the  change in  the makeupof  the Committee  and the  objectives of  the Committee.  So,  I agreewith the concept,  Governor Lindsey.  It  ought to  be there,  but  it'svery hard to  find in  the  data either across  time  in the United Statesor  across  countries.

MR. LINDSEY.  Could it be  that  on  the way down we  are doingwhat we are  supposed to  do and on  the  way up  we are not doing what weare  supposed to  do?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  When we begin to  test  the  outer limitsof  these models,  I would hesitate  to  look at  the  output of  our verysophisticated model if  we ran a $500 billion  deficit  through thatmodel.  What  would happen, I would suggest,  is  that  the model  wouldreplicate very poorly what would be  likely  to  occur  in  the real world.If  you don't believe a $500 billion  deficit would be  enough to  producethat  result,  make  it  a $1 trillion deficit.  The nature of  thesemodels  is  that  they are  substantially  linear in  terms  of how most ofthe  forecasts  and simulations  are made.  But when we  get to  the  outerlimits of policy actions,  very  significant nonlinearities may existthat  are not  captured in the  first  approximations  of  these modelsbecause  their  simple linear  equations  really do  not reflect what theworld is  like at  those outer limits.  An analogy might  be that  as  aparticle accelerates  toward the  speed of  light,  its physical naturewill  change only  little.  As  it  get  close to  the speed of  light,  itsnature will be altered very dramatically.  I have a suspicion thatdoing  this  sort  of  thing to  these models would have  a very similareffect,  though long before we get  to  the  speed of  light.  We mustseriously question our assumptions  about how the sacrifice ratios  andother  factors are  interrelated and not merely presume  that  we  caninfer those interrelationships  from  the  types  of  models  that we use.I suspect  that  those models can  lead to misunderstandings  that  weought not  to  entertain for very long.  So,  I agree with your generalfocus.  There  is  a serious  question here.This kind of  Committee discussion is  useful,  and it  is  quitepossible that  our discussion  today has been the best we  have had onthis  issue.  If  we keep  talking, we may find  ourselves  in agreement  ona lot of  different questions relating  to  this  issue.  As  a practicalmatter, I do  think it  is  worthwhile to wait  to  see how the basiclegislative  vehicle  evolves.  I must say that  I agree with bothPresident  Boehne  and the Vice Chairman with respect  to  the primaryimportance  of  our actions  and very specifically with respect to  thepolitical questions  that are  raised when major value  trade-offs  areapparent.  In those  cases, we must  convince the Congress  as  to whatthe  real  trade-offs would be  for  economic reasons,  and  in any event wecannot  in our  society go against what is  fundamentally called for bythe  law of  the  land.  We may or may not  agree with the  law of  theland, but  what makes the  country work, what makes  it  great  in  fact,  isthat we all  adhere to  it.  With that,  I think  it  is  a good idea  to goout  for coffee.[Coffee break]

MR. KOHN.  There  is  a footnote  in the  Bluebook that  says  thatgoing  from a deficit  of about  2 percent  of  GDP, which  is  approximately1/30-31/96-51-where we are,  to a balanced budget  over seven years  would produce  achange  of  about  1 percentage point  in  the  equilibrium rate  in  ourmodel.  Now, that number  should be viewed with a huge  standard erroraround it,  but that  is  the  order of magnitude.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Don, you referred to  the bond market vigilanteswho  try to  correctly anticipate  the Committee's actions.  One  thingthey have been able  to  do  is  to  derive  indicators  like  the  Taylor rulethat  seems  to approximate  our actions.  If we  follow an opportunisticstrategy, doesn't  it  imply  a much more complicated mathematicalexpression of  our policy processes with lots  of  nonlinearities?  Itseems  to me  that  inevitably there would be a loss of  understanding onthe part  of  the market  about  how we  react  to  things.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I am not  sure,  President  Parry.  I agree  that  atleast  in concept  putting out  a mathematically precise rule would beclearer than  something  as vague  as  an opportunistic strategy.  But  Ithink that  in practice the market has  come  to understand, as  a  fewmembers  such  as  President Boehne already have  said today, that  theCommittee has  very strongly resisted increases  in  inflation.  TheCommittee's  actions  in  1994 were  very helpful  in that  regard.  I thinkthe market also believes  that  the Committee  has  its  eye on a pricestability objective  over the  long run.  Market participants do  not,  asPresident Melzer pointed out,  anticipate that  the Committee  willdeliberately take action to  reduce  the  inflation rate below 3 percent.But  I think they actually have  developed a rather good understandingof  the Committee's  intentions  and operations  by looking at  its  actionsin various  contexts.  You would have  to  judge whether acting  in theway you  think is  best as  circumstances  change over  time  is  better  forthe  economy  than putting out  some  rule  that might describe youractions  over  some period of  time.  I would  think that  inevitably youwould have to violate  that  rule  sometimes.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  If  I could just have  a follow-up question:  Iassume  that  under both strategies  you have a linear Phillips  curve,and therefore  the  output  loss  is  the  same under  each.  What  isdifferent  is  the  time period, or point  in history, in which you incurthe  output  loss.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  For  the  same  set of  shocks hitting the  economy,the  output loss  relative  to  no  disinflation is  the  same.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Some people may have gotten  the  impression thatone  strategy is  less painful  than  the  other.  The pain is  equal;  thequestion is  when you actually sustain it.  Is  that  correct?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  In a linear world that would be  correct,  and thatis  true  in this model.  I don't  think the  Committee  has behaved thatway, and many models  suggest  that  the  output  loss  is  not  totallylinear.  In  such models,  large  misses and large variations  in outputare weighted relatively more heavily than  small variations in  output.But  it  is  an open  question whether minimizing variations in  outputaround  the mean, even with the  same  integral  of  output  losses,  isbetter than having  a few big recessions  to  get  to  price stability.That  is  one of  the  questions  that  the Committee would need to  considerif  it were  thinking about adopting a time  frame  for getting  to price1/30-31/96-52-stability.  Should you go there  quickly or  should you go  there  slowly?A lot of people  think slow is  better  than  fast, but there may be noway to prove  that--or at  least  it  would be very hard to prove one wayor  another.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That  is  what we  talked about  earlier.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right.  It  is  a question of how the  economy adaptsand how the  institutions in  the  economy  adapt.  I think there arereasons  to believe  that going  to price stability  slowly and allowinginstitutions to  adapt  to  lower  and lower inflation  rates  would removesome  of  the  frictions  one might worry about, say, in  the  financialsector.  Reality is  much more complicated than  the models  say.  Iagree with you  that  these models  are very linear,  and fast  or slow,deliberate or  opportunistic will  give you the same  integral  of  loss.The  output  loss  of eight percentage points would be  the  same in  themodel, but  I suspect  that  it's  quite different  in real  life.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for Don?  If  not,  letme  start off.  I will  try not to be  as verbose as  I was  at  the lastmeeting, but  I think there  are  certain points  that  require  somerepetition.  First,  it  is  hard to  find in economic  history a recessionthat began while  the stock market was  still taking off and earningsexpectations were still  reasonably good.  Indeed, even  though thereare very significant pockets  of  weakness, as  was  discussed around thistable, no  one is  saying that  the  economy is  collapsing and that  thereis  a yawning  gap into which we are  falling.  Nonetheless,  I do  thinkthere  is very clear evidence  that  the  downside risks are  significantlylarger now than  they were earlier.  In my judgment,  it probably iswise  to recognize those  risks and raise  a serious  question as  towhether a policy action would provide  some  appropriate  insurance  inthis  context.In my view real  rates  are  still  higher than I feelcomfortable with.  The  analogy that  I made at  the December meeting,  towhich Jerry Jordan referred yesterday, about the  economy  feeling  likea car  running with  its parking brake  still  engaged, is  still  clearlyappropriate.  The actual  short-term evidence that we have  suggeststhat  the January  figures are going  to be  rather miserable.  The weeklydata  that  are  available on  industrial  production, which constituteonly a modest part of  the  industrial production index,  contributesomething  in  the  area of  a  .4 percentage point decline  in  the totalindex.  To be  sure, autos  are a big factor  there.  The major problemthat  concerns me  in  this  context  is  that we  are relatively  far alongin  the economic  expansion.  We  are well  beyond the average  length ofsuch  expansions in  the  post-World War  II period, and indeed, unless  mymemory  fails me,  the  current  expansion is  probably already  the secondlongest  in  that period, excluding  the  one  that was sustained by theVietnam War.What  tends  to  happen when an  economic expansion gets  "long-in-the-tooth"  is  that  a much broader  concept of  inventories becomesrelevant.  I would hypothesize  that  two  types  of  inventories affecteconomic  activity:  The  first  is  the  standard type  of  businessinventories  that  are  included in  the  GDP data;  the  second  is  the grossstocks  that  exist both  in the household area and  in  the business area.For example, we tend to  look at  final  sales as  though  they wereconsumption.  Well,  they are not.  Consumption basically  is  the use of1/30-31/96-53-a stock, and it  is  perhaps better reflected in depreciation  than it  isin purchases.  Indeed,  in  the motor vehicle  area,  for  example,  thesluggishness  of  sales  is being  caused by the  fact that  we have hadfairly high levels  of  automotive sales  for a considerable period oftime.  We have built up  the  stock of  vehicles on  the  road quiteextensively,  and we have created a large number  of  second-car andthird-car households.  We are  getting into  a situation  in which thereis,  in a sense, another  type of  inventory out  there that  issuppressing economic output.  We see  that  in capital  goods markets andin a lot  of  other places.  If we were  to  get a better  estimate of whatis actually consumed in  the  economy,  I suspect we would probably dosomething  quite similar  to  certain revisions  in  the  federal  and stateand local  government  accounts  involving shifts  from purchases  toconsumption.  In  that  context,  it probably means  that we  ought  to besubstituting depreciation for  a lot  of  the  longer-lived assets  thatare  classified under personal consumption expenditures or  producersdurable equipment.  While  I have not  looked at  the  data,  I suspectthat were we to  do  that--we are, of  course,  looking at  net propertyaccount increases--we  would probably find that  the consolidatedinventories  situation, including  both business and consumerinventories and unsold stocks  of homes,  is  exerting a much moreegregious  and suppressing  effect on  economic activity at  this  stagethan so-called business  inventories  or primary inventories alone wouldsuggest.The reason  I raise  this  issue  is  that there  is  the perennialquestion  of,  why do  business cycle expansions  come  to  an end?  Intoday's environment,  where we presumably curbed the accumulation ofbusiness  inventories  with our preemptive moves in  1994,  it  is  notclear  to me how well we  have  done in  the  secondary inventory areas.  Agoodly part  of  the weakness that  we have been seeing probably reflectsthe fact  that  there  is  an  ultimate life  expectancy to  a business cyclein much the  same sense  that  it  probably exists  in human beings.  Theexpansion cannot  go  on continuously;  something will  go wrong.  It  ishard  to  know where we  stand at  this  stage.  In  the past we would haveperiodic recessions  largely because  imbalances would emerge,  inflationwould occur,  the  Fed would clamp down,  and economic  activity wouldperiod.  But  our policy has  altered  that process,  and  it  is  not clearwhat will  happen as  a consequence or what ultimately will  bring thiscycle  to  an end.  Do  we now have the  extraordinary capability neededto  fine-tune  the  system  to make a cyclical  expansion go  onindefinitely?  I doubt  it, but  it is  hard for me  to  judge how longthis  cyclical  advance will  continue.As  far as  short-term developments  are concerned, I think theinitial claims  figures are  showing that  the economic  expansion  isweakening.  The production figures are weakening.  The purchasingmanagers' data  that we  are picking up  across  the  country now suggestthat  this  economy is  soft.  I don't doubt  that weather is  a factorhere.  I don't doubt  that weather may be  in the  consumer confidencenumbers we  are  looking at.  I find the  Conference Board numbers  alittle dubious.  The  sharp decline in  those numbers  looks  exactly likethe  sharp  spike  that we had a couple of  years ago,  for which we couldnot  find an  explanation at the  time.  I don't know whether in  factthere  are  sampling problems in  the Conference Board  survey.  TheMichigan Survey has  a smaller sample but  far better control, whichsuggests  that we probably ought  to be  looking at  that  survey.1/30-31/96-54-Nonetheless,  commodity prices  are weakening.  The Journal  of  Commerceindex, which has  not been  a bad measure  of  industrial prices,  isshowing much the  same  thing.  One would not  expect  that weather per sewould  tend to have  the  effects on  employment, production, and the  likethat  one would see as  a consequence  of,  say,  the Blizzard of  1996.Not  irrelevant to  this  issue  is  the  fact  that  economicactivity in  Europe  is  stuttering.  I am not  saying  that  a hugearbitrage  exists between Europe and the United States,  but  there  issome.  It's very hard for  a major industrial  country such as  ours  tomove  forward with great  alacrity while  a significant  number of  ourtrading partners  are experiencing  sluggish or  declining growth.Needless to  say, neither  the Canadian nor the Mexican economies  are  ingreat  shape.  Indeed,  the  Greenbook projections  indicate that  they areweaker  than in  the  last Greenbook.  And the more we  look at what  isgoing on  in Europe,  the more nervous-making it  appears.Finally, while  I would not  want  to  rest  policy on this,  it isby no means  irrelevant that  a significant weakening  in U.S.  economicactivity is  going  to make a very important national policy trendtoward budget  deficit  control more difficult  to  implement.Ordinarily,  I would say that  that  is  their problem and this  is  ours,but we  should have a view that what  is  in the  national  interest  is  notirrelevant  to  the way we  conduct our business.I come  to  the bottom line  that while  I am not  of  the  schoolthat  is  getting  terribly concerned that  the economy is  about  to  dipinto who knows what,  there  is  an increasing element  of  downside risksthat  I think we have to  consider.  Given what  I have described as  anoverhang of  secondary inventories, which I believe  is  there,  theupside risks  seem quite minimal.  While  I don't  think the  downsiderisks are all  that  large,  the net  downside risks  feel  high,  given thelevel  of real,  short-term interest  rates.  In  this  type  ofenvironment,  it would be wise  in my  judgment  for us  to move rates down25  basis  points.  I have  convened a Federal  Reserve Board meetingafter  this meeting is  over  in which  I will recommend that  we move thediscount  rate down.  But  that  is  for later, and I would like  topropose for your comments a reduction  of 25  basis points  in  thefederal  funds  rate.  If  the  Committee  were to accept  that proposal,  Ithink  that  a symmetrical  directive probably would be wise.  Yes,President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I want  to comment at  somewhat greater  lengththan usual  because I seem to  be constantly putting myself  in positionsthat  are at  odds  with one  another.  I think that  3 percent  inflationor  lower  is  a very good long-run target  for  this  group.  My operativedefinition of  price  stability  is  stability at  low rates.  I would takeadvantage  of  opportunities when costs  seem low to move  in  thedirection of pushing inflation  down.  That said, I think  it'sdebatable whether  there is  any  specific  target below 3 percent  that  ispreferable  to staying  at  3 percent.  In  that  environment,  it  seems  tome that  to be  opportunistic  and to move against  inflation when thecosts  seem  low really involves moving less  than might  otherwise berequired given the  economic  data, or  not moving at  all  when a smallmove  seems  required.  Right now, I think the  correct  course  of  actionseems more murky  than usual.  There are  underlying sources  of  growththat we  talked about yesterday.  Labor markets are  tight by anytraditional  definition.  There  are some  reasons  to  think that  housing1/30-31/96-55-is not  completely dead.  I think your inventory stock arguments, Mr.Chairman, are very credible, but  there  are wealth  effects  from abooming  stock market working in  the  other direction.  Moreover, wehave eased  50 basis points  over  the last  six months;  we have reversedlast February's  tightening;  and there has  not been  time  for  the morerecent easing  actions  to play out  fully.Finally, while we may have more headroom on  inflation thantraditional  calculations would indicate,  it  is by no means  clear thatwe do.  The Greenbook projects  some minor pickup  in both the  core  CPIand the  ECI.  In  fact,  these upticks may be understated.  So,  while  Ido  think there are downside risks and  the expansion probably hasreached a mature  stage,  if  it were up  to me  I would buy a littleinsurance  now that might  enable  inflation to move  down slowly  from  3percent  or  at least  hold the  line at  3 percent  through the  next cycle.I would buy that  insurance  in  the  form of  not moving now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  In our  discussions  around the  table, we  talk  onoccasion about our  ignorance, about how little we  know about  a lot  ofthings  such as  lags,  instrument variables, and so  on.  But at  times Iam impressed by the  collective judgment  of  this group  in assessingwhat  is  going on in  the  economy and knowing  how to make the policyadjustments  that  are needed.  Two years  ago we started raising thefunds  rate well  before professional  economists  in  the  businesscommunity, academia, and Wall  Street were  saying we  should or  evenbefore  our models and  staff projections  were  indicating the need.  Hadwe  listened to  some of  those  Fedwatcher views or  looked at  Blue Chipor  staff projections, we would not have  begun to  tighten when we did.We  tightened because we had  information  that  told us,  in  theterminology that we use now, that  the  equilibrium real  rate wasrising,  things were  starting to  move, and we made an  adjustment  thatwas appropriate.A year ago  at  this  time many of  those  outside  observers weresaying  that we were going to be pushing the  funds  rate up  to  somethinglike 7, 7-1/2,  or  8 percent.  Again, on  the  basis  of  our collectivejudgment  we went to  a 6 percent  funds rate  a year  ago, but we  said wewere getting to  the  stop-out point.  I supported that move with theidea that  it  was  an  insurance policy.  I was not  convinced that  it  wasnecessary, but  in  terms  of potential  errors  it  would be  the  leastcostly to  correct.  And given market psychology and other  factors  atthe  time,  I thought  that  it  was wise  to  raise  the  funds  rate to  the  6percent  level  so  long  as we were willing to  retrace that move if  thatinsurance  turned out not  to be necessary.So,  I view what we  did in July and December as  simply havingcancelled the  insurance that we  took out a year ago.  In  the meantime,I have  a sense that  the  equilibrium real rate has moved down  fromwhatever  it was  a year  ago.  Your description of  householdinventories--the stocks  of real  goods  held by consumers--carries acounterpart  in  terms of  attitudes  toward financial  assets  andfinancial  liabilities.  If  consumers  believe they have reached  thesaturation point  for  the moment  in  their  stocks  of  certain  consumerdurables,  the  counterpart  is  that  they are going to be  trying toreduce  their  financial  liabilities  or  to increase  their  financialassets.  They are adjusting  their net  financial positions, which  is1/30-31/96-56-also consistent with  the  idea that  the  equilibrium real  rate has moveddown.If  I thought  that  the Greenbook/Bluebook projections werecorrect  about a 5-1/2  percent  funds  rate producing a 3 percentinflation rate  out through  1997,  I would have to be  arguing forraising  the  funds  rate.  The  only way I can  support  reducing the fundsrate  is  to be consistent  and say that  I don't believe  thoseprojections.  I have  to believe  that we  are  in an environment wherethe  inflation rate will  come  in  lower than is  indicated by either thecentral  tendency of  the Committee members' forecasts  or theBluebook/Greenbook projections.  If  that  turns  out  to  be wrong, then  Iwill be out  in  front saying,  "Let's get  the  funds  rate back up becausewe simply were wrong."  For now, I am comfortable with the  idea  thatit is  appropriate  to move  the  funds  rate down and see whether  or notinflation  in  fact  comes  in at  a lower rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, I would not  favor  reducing thefederal  funds  rate.  I would refer  to  President  Boehne's  comment  aboutour deeds  speaking more  loudly than  our words.  If you look at  themembers' economic  projections  for 1996,  we are  saying  in  effect thatwe  are  at potential.  The midpoint  of  the central  tendency of  theCommittee  members'  forecasts  indicates  that  the economy is  going togrow  2.1 percent  in  1996.  The CPI appears  to have  increased 2.7percent  in 1995,  and  the  central  tendency of  the members'  forecastshas  a midpoint of  2.8  percent.  The  unemployment rate  is  equal  to  orslightly below the  natural  rate and  is  expected to be  there at  the  endof  the year.  It  seems  to me  that  the Committee's  forecasts  speak veryloudly and are  in conflict with reducing rates  at  this  time.  Irealize  that we  are  in a period where  it appears  that  the  economy hassome weaknesses.  The  staff  forecast  calls  for 0.8  percent GDP  growthin  the  current quarter.  The  question is  whether  or not  that  slowerrate will be temporary.  If  it's  temporary, then policy ought  not bechanged.  We can't  make that  determination right now.  We  aredisadvantaged by a whole host  of  things  including  a lack of  data andinsufficient time  to model  the new information.  I see  no  reason tochange now.  It  would seem  to be  the prudent thing,  in  fact  theopportune  thing,  to  wait a few weeks before we make  a judgment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I would prefer not  to  move at  thistime.  We  have an economy that  is  growing at  about potential.  Thereare  continued inflationary pressures.  They are  not  strong pressures,but  I think we will  be making  little or no progress  on inflation.  Irealize we are  long  into  this  expansion, but  there  is  also a lot  ofnoise in  our current data.  In my view, it would be wise for us  towait  and gather more  information  to  help us  determine with more1/30-31/96-57-assurance  where we  ought  to be and where we will  be down the  road.So,  I think  the wiser course would be  for us  to  wait.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  One  of  the major reasons why monetary policy hasbeen successful  in recent years is  that  it has  had a forward-lookingapproach to  it.  Forward-looking monetary policy means that we have  topeer  into  the  future,  and I don't know anybody who can do  that  with20/20  vision.  There is  always  some mist  out  there  through which weneed to  look.  As  I try to  look out  through  that mist, my sense isthat monetary policy is  still  on the  restrictive  side and that we  areoperating with our foot  on the brake.  And while  I don't  think this  isthe  time  to  adopt  a stimulative monetary policy and move our  foot  tothe  accelerator, I do  think  it  is  time  to  lighten  our foot  some on  thebrake in  the  context  of an  economy that  in my view exhibits  somedownside  risks.  So,  Mr. Chairman,  I support your  recommendation of  a25  basis point drop  in  the  federal  funds rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman, the policy call  this morning isa very close  one.  There  is  certainly a case  for  easing policy and youhave made it.  But  I come  out,  probably not  surprisingly, much closerto  Cathy Minehan and Bob Parry.  Cathy  in particular expressed veryclearly and eloquently in our  earlier discussion  the  kind of  thing  Ihad in mind operationally.  Beyond what  she said,  it's not  at  allclear  to me yet how much of  a real deceleration  in  activity isactually occurring.  We have bad weather, government  shutdowns,  andstructural  changes  in  the  retail  sector all  fogging up,  in my view,the meaning  of much  of  the  recent information.  Also, we have  a lackof headroom in  the  economy, as  I think many would agree,  and at  leastsome  signs of  a firming of wages.  All  those  things  incline me tocaution.  Sometimes  I think  inertia can be  a good thing,  and  I amfeeling  the need for  a lot  of  it  at  this point.I hear Jerry Jordan's point, but  I do  think it needs  to  besaid that  it may be more  difficult this  year  than  in most other yearsto move  the  funds  rate back up  later  if  things  don't go  the way wewant  them to.  We are  going to  get a lot  of new information  thathopefully will  clarify the  economic  situation in  the  fairly nearfuture,  and  I think we  ought  to  look at  it  before we move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  current situationgives me  some considerable pause.  As  I try to look  at  the  realinterest  rate situation, Charts  4 and  5 in  the  "Financial Indicators"package don't  suggest  to  me  that  real rates  are particularly high, atleast  relative to  history.  There may be an opportunity here, were weto  do nothing, to  do  a bit better  on  inflation.  The mechanism that  Ihave in mind would be  through  a stronger dollar  than we  now anticipateand what  that would mean for  inflation--recognizing, of  course,  thatwe  can't really  forecast exchange  rates.  They are  far more a hopethan  a certainty.  On the  other  side of  this  coin,  I am certainlyconvinced that we cannot  halt  turning points  in  the economy,  or atleast  I can't.  As  I said before,  I am pretty convinced  that  thecurrent quarter and perhaps the  next quarter will be rather soggy1/30-31/96-58-based on  inventory considerations  and the  time  it will  take to  workthrough the  inventory adjustments.  Moreover,  something that  lookssoggy could turn out  to be  something worse.  The  bottom line  is  thatin  this environment,  and recognizing that  I can't halt  turning points,I find your insurance argument  persuasive and I would go  along with a1/4 point  reduction  in  the  federal  funds  rate at  this  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Like  others  around thetable,  I would not like  to  see us  step back  from our  tough, long-termstance against  inflation.  I would not support  a further  easing atthis  time unless  the risks were  quite clearly  on  the side  of  furtherweakening in  economic  growth or we  judge  that we have  a much morefavorable  inflation  setting and see an  economy that  may be growingsomewhat below potential.  Although most of  us see  only moderategrowth in  the period ahead and some  recent  data  suggest  the need foradded caution  about how things may unfold, I do not yet have  the  sensethat we  are  about  to  see  a major stalling of  the expansion, althoughthe risks  clearly seem to be greater  on  the  down side.  At  the sametime,  I am  increasingly convinced that we have  achieved a much morefavorable  inflation environment  that  gives us  some  latitude  for amodest additional  easing without any substantial  risk of  a prospectivedeterioration  in  inflation.  As policymakers, we must  always  try todifferentiate between  temporary and longer-lasting  influences.  In myview, there  is  a good deal  of  evidence  that  the  favorable  changes thatwe  see  in  inflation expectations  and behavior are  indeed persisting.On that basis,  I would support  a modest  easing  of  25 basis points  atthis  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I support an easing of  25  basis points with asymmetric  directive.  I think it  is  important  to  take  out  someinsurance  against  the  downside risks.  I am a bit more  optimistic thanthe  staff  forecast  that we  can continue  to  see some  progress  oninflation.  In addition, based on a fairly  flat yield curve,  Icontinue to  think we  are a bit behind  in making downward adjustments.So,  it would be  a good idea  in my view to  go  ahead and ease 25  basispoints  today.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman, last year  I was predicting thatwe would see  a very substantial  change  in  the  stance  of  fiscal policy.I was wrong.  That  has been the  big  surprise to me  since the  lastmeeting.  Three weeks  ago  I was betting  that  today we would see  a longbond rate  on the  order of  6.50 percent  because  it  seemed to me  thatthe  markets  also had realized that we were not going to  get  the  fiscalaction expected earlier.  I was very interested in Don Kohn's  estimatethat  the magnitude  of what we are  talking about here would beequivalent  in this  language  to  a reduction of  about  100  basis pointsin  the  equilibrium real  federal  funds rate.  So,  it  seemed about rightfor bond market  rates  to back up  to  6.50 percent  on  a realization thatthe  odds  of  some  fiscal  restraint  agreement had been reduced from,say, 90  percent  to  50  percent.  The market  didn't react  that way;  thelong bond rate  stayed around 6 percent.  I think the reason  for that,I forget  if  it  was  the  two-step  or  the three-step--1/30-31/96-59-

MS.  MINEHAN.  The  do-si-do!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Or  the do-si-do.  I think the market perceivedthat near-term economic  conditions were deteriorating ratherdramatically.  It  is probably true that  that  is  happening.  As  I havesaid, conditions  in various  sectors  of  the economy are much worse  thanwe  thought,  and that  is  what  the market was  seeing.  Hence, what  Iwould normally interpret  as  a reason at  the very least  to  stop  easingand perhaps  even a reason to move  toward tightening,  i.e.,  thebreakdown of  the budget negotiations,  is  overwhelmed by other factors.The failure of bond market  rates  to  move up  50 basis points  suggeststo  me that  even  a reduction of  25  basis points  in  the real  federalfunds  rate would still  be  less  of  a move  than the market  is  callingfor  and therefore is  consistent with the  strategy that  Don Kohnoutlined in his memo about  taking  advantage of  deflationarysituations.  Cathy, you raised that  in your discussion.  I would saythat  given the  failure of  the market  to  act,  the  funds  rate isprobably at  least  50  basis points  too high right  now.  By splittingthe  difference  at  25,  I think we  are buying a little  insurance  on thereal  side and we are at  the  same  time taking advantage  of what mightbe  an opportunity.  I hate  the  term  "opportunistic strategy,"  but  Iguess  that  approach is  consistent with what is  termed an  opportunisticstrategy  to  reduce  inflation.  So,  I support  your recommendation, Mr.Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The  other day Ed Yardini,  in  one of  hisnewsletters,  said that we were going to  be  cutting interest  rates  thisyear--either  early in  the  year to  head off  a recession or  later  in theyear  to  try  to bring the  economy out  of  one.  The  first  alternativeseems  much more  desirable  to me.  I believe  that the  risks  are veryunbalanced toward the  downside, as  you have  indicated, Mr.  Chairman.We  do have  to be  forward-looking and we can't  wait  to be  absolutelysure about how the economy will  evolve.  Although I am not  a globalthinker, as  Business Week pointed out  this  week, both the  economicsand  the policy moves  abroad make it  easier  for us  to make a modesteasing move  today without  adverse  consequences  to  the dollar.  In Julyand December,  we  cancelled  some  insurance  against  a rise  in inflation.Right  now, a 1/4  point  insurance policy against  a recession would bein order.  I agree with Larry Lindsey  that we probably could justify agreater move  and a 1/4  point  move now is  sort  of  dragging our  feet.It  is  therefore consistent  with opportunism and our  long-terminflation objectives.  I agree with your proposal.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Where  is  a vote when you need it?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I know how you  feel,  Tom!

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Like  Cathy, I would favor alternative B.  Iwould favor  it  strongly.  One  of  the  factors  is  the  Greenbook forecastof rising inflationary pressures in  the  consumer price  arena and alsoin labor markets  and that  is  consistent with some  of  the anecdotalevidence.  Nobody has mentioned it,  but we  have had PPI  increases  of0.5  percent  in each of  the  last  two  months.  So,  there  is  some  reasonto  be concerned about inflation even  though I have  heard very little1/30-31/96-60-expression of  that  concern.  There are  some straws  in the wind withrespect to  rising inflationary pressures.  Secondly,  I think it  ispretty clear that  3 percent  inflation  is  embedded in  long-termexpectations,  and  I think such  inflation  is  too  high.  Third, I am notat  all  sure  that monetary policy  is  still  in  a restrictive posture.Don Kohn has  talked about the  difficulty of  assessing  just what  thereal  equilibrium funds  rate is.  Certainly from the  perspective that  Ihave used over  time,  and this  is  useful  only in  longer  time  frames,the monetary aggregates  and the credit markets  and  so  forth are notsending the message  that policy  is  in a restrictive posture.  Forthose who want us  to  be  judged by our actions,  I think this  actionsays  that we  are not  interested in lowering inflation and inflationexpectations.  The ultimate reaction of  higher yields  in  the bondthe performance of  the economy  in the  short run.  I have no way ofpredicting what  is  going  to happen  to  long-term  interest  rates,  but  itis  not outside  the  realm of  reason  that  over  time  after markets  digestthis  action we will  find that we have not  taken a step  that will  leadtoward  lower  longer-term yields.Lowering the  discount  rate makes  a bad situation worse byunderlining this move.  In my view, there is  no reason why the  fundsrate can't be  on top  of  the discount rate or  for that matter gothrough  the  discount rate.  In  fact,  when one  looks  at  what  is  goingon with these  sweep accounts  and the way the  supply of  reserves  isshrinking,  for us  to have  a discount rate that  creates an  incentive  toborrow does  not make any  sense.  So,  I would not reduce  the  discountrate.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Mr.  Chairman, I support your proposal  and Iagree with your assessment of  the  risks.  As  I have argued,  I do  thinksome  further  adjustment  is  needed to achieve  that  elusive neutralmonetary policy.  From my perspective,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that wedid make  downward adjustments  in  the  funds rate  in July and December,all  we have done  thus  far  is  to  offset  the  decline  in inflationaryexpectations.  That  leaves  the  real  rate  at about  its  February 1995level, which was  a real  funds  rate that  I think most of  us consideredto be  consistent with braking  the  economy.  History has  borne out  thefact  that we  did brake  the  economy.  I agree with the  assessment  thatour foot  remains  slightly on the brake and we ought  to remove  it.  Howmuch our  foot  is  on  the brake is  an extremely  tricky call  from mystandpoint.  The alternative  simulations  presented in  the Greenbookcertainly caution us  that  we would be running a very significantinflation risk if we were  to  adopt  the easier alternative  and cut  thefunds rate by a cumulative 100  basis points.  I absolutely concur withthat  conclusion.  Such a cut would incur a tremendous  risk.  I wouldnot envision anything of  that  sort.  But  is  a 25  basis point cutreasonable?  It  is  tremendously hard to  gauge whether or not  it  isreasonable.  One  thing  that  I found myself doing  to  try  to get  a senseof whether  or not  this  is  a move within a reasonable  range is  to  lookat  that  Taylor rule chart  in  the  "Financial Indicators" package.  Whatthat  shows  is  that,  using Taylor's rule  as he proposed it,  we arecurrently at  the high end of  a reasonable range  of values.  Looking atour behavior now  in terms  of  our own past behavior, we  are well withinthe ballpark of  our past behavior.  From that  perspective,  currentpolicy is  not overwhelmingly tight, but  certainly a further downward1/30-31/96-61-adjustment  of  25 basis points  would still  leave us well  within therange of  our past behavior.  It would not be a major move inconsistentwith what we have done before.  Again, that would not  represent anopportunistic  approach, but  one designed to bring inflation down.  So,I certainly support  this move.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, I agree with those  who  feel  thatthe  economy is  probably all  right,  but  I also think that  the  downsiderisks  clearly are  elevated.  I also believe  that  it  is  quite  likelythat  the  equilibrium federal  funds  rate  is  lower  than it  was earlier.Consequently, a somewhat lower  rate  is  not  inconsistent  with what theCommittee's  goals  have been all  along  and will  continue  to be.  Withthe  inflation outlook  as  good as  it  is  for the  near and  intermediateterms,  all of  this  leaves  us  with room to move,  and I support yourrecommendation as  an  insurance  policy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I would wait.  It's  interestingthat  the  three M's on  this  side  of  the  table who voted at  the  lastmeeting would all  come  out  the  other way this  time.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  We  used to vote!

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  My reason  is  that we  are  forecasting the  economyto be  at  potential  output.  There is  a lot  of  uncertainty.  A lot  ofquestions  are being raised about  the  short-term outlook,  and we  havetalked about  these.  I don't  think anyone knows  for  sure why theexpansion has  slowed, whether it  is  the  Federal  government  shutdown orconcern about Bosnia or  the weather.  The business friends  that  I talkto  are all  trying to  figure  out how to operate  in this  new, low-growthenvironment.  I think Governor  Phillips mentioned this  factoryesterday.  This  is  a real problem for  people  trying to  operatebusinesses  today because  their  environment  is  so  competitive.  Myfeeling  is  that  the  sogginess we  are  seeing now in  the economy couldbe a short-term fluctuation  that  could correct  itself.  I don't seeany urgency to  move  at  this  point.On the  opportunistic  strategy issue,  obviously  some of usview this differently  in  terms of  which  side  of  the opportunisticstrategy we  are looking  at.  Cathy's presentation was near my view.  Iwould view the  current situation as  an opportunity to make  a littlefurther progress  toward price  stability at  this  point,  since there  issome  considerable uncertainty now.Finally on the discount  rate,  I think  that  Tom Melzer  had avery interesting  suggestion.  I remember a footnote  in  the Bluebookthat  said there  really was  no problem in having both the  discount rateand the  fed funds  rate  at  the same  level.  So,  I too would supportthat  idea.  If  we  are  going to  lower  the  fed  funds rate,  which itseems we  are,  the  Board should give  consideration  to  that  idea.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let's have a vote  on a 25  basis-pointreduction, symmetric.  Would you read the appropriate  language?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  With a reference  to  the discount rate?1/30-31/96-62-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let's  ask  the  Secretary  of  thisCommittee what  is  appropriate.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  This  would be  adding a reference to  thediscount  rate  at  the  end of  the  first sentence that  would read,"taking account of  a possible reduction in the  discount rate."

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think we  have  done that  before when thissituation has  arisen.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  have?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay,  then do  so.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I will  be  reading  from page 24  of  the Bluebook:"In  the  implementation of policy  for the  immediate  future,  theCommittee  seeks  to decrease  slightly the  existing degree  of pressureon  reserve positions,  taking  account  of  a possible reduction  in  thediscount rate.  In the  context of  the  Committee's  long-run objectivesfor  price stability and sustainable  economic  growth, and givingcareful  consideration  to  economic,  financial,  and monetarydevelopments,  slightly greater  reserve  restraint  or  slightly lesserreserve  restraint would be  acceptable  in the  intermeeting period.  Thecontemplated reserve  conditions  are  expected to be  consistent withmoderate growth  in M2  and M3  over coming months."

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I had a question.  Are you goingto  share with us  the press statement  that you will be making?1/30-31/96-63-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am sorry, yes.  Good for you.  Therelevant paragraph would read:  "Moderating economic  expansion inrecent months has  reduced potential  inflationary pressures goingforward.  With price  and cost  trends  already subdued, a slight  easingof monetary policy  is  consistent with contained inflation  andsustainable  growth."  That  is  followed by the  usual boiler plate.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Do  you care  about  consistency with the  Greenbookforecast  with respect  to  inflation?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The Greenbook forecast  is  a forecast ofthe  staff.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I understand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The Federal  Open Market  Committeelistens  to  the  staff  with great reverence,  [Laughter]  but  it  thenmakes its  decision.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  How about  the  forecasts of  the  FOMC members?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  FOMC members'  forecasts  areestimates  of  the most  likely outcome.  Policy is  based on  the mostlikely outcome  conditioned by a distribution of probabilities.  Ifsomebody could guarantee that  outcome,  I would  say that  insurance  isunnecessary at  this  stage.  I would  think that  implicit  in  ourinappropriate, as  some members have  stated, it will  get  reversed as  itshould be.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  So  one  can  accept the  forecast,  but  it's  aninsurance policy?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  In  other words,  I find  theforecast not  an unreasonable maximum likelihood forecast.  That  is  afactor that  is  relevant  to one's view of  the  world, but  it  does  notdetermine what the  appropriate policy stance should be.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  People may change  their  forecast?

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sure.  Some of  them might.  I know onewho will.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr. Chairman, a reminder:  Under  our usualprocedures our announcement will  be made at  approximately 2:15 p.m.Particularly since  there  will be a luncheon before  then, we have to bevery careful  not to  allow any inadvertent word of  today's policyto me  that  last  time  there was a story  on  the  tape by one of  our well-known Fed watchers  that  suggested that he might have known something.It  was  ambiguous  as  to whether  he did, but  we have to  be  extremelycareful  that  knowledge of  this  decision stays  with the people  in  thisroom until  2:15  p.m.

MR. PARRY.  Why does  it  have  to be  at  2:15 p.m.?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  Committee would need to make  some changes.  Ithink  in the past the  Committee has  wondered whether  it  wanted to havethe  market  sitting there  for hours wondering exactly what  time  theCommittee meeting would be over  and speculating, in  the event  of adelayed release, whether  something unusual might be  going on.  Therewas  some merit  in regularizing  the  time of  the release.  The Committeecould  change that.
