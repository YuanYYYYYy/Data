CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning,  everyone.  We ought  tocongratulate Governor  Lindsey who  has just  returned without mishapfrom Rumania with an  addition to  his  family.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Yes!

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Congratulations.  [Applause]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  do you have, a girl?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  A  girl?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  A one-year  old girl.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  How nice.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  I have been trying  to  tell  Larrywas  that  he had better  learn Rumanian pretty quickly because when shelearns  to  talk  if  he  does not understand Rumanian,  he  is  in  trouble!

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  He's  in  trouble  anyway!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  For now, it  is  either  feed me or change me;that won't  always be  so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we'll  allow you  to  move approvalof  the minutes  for  the  September 27th meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  You  all have  beforeyou the  Report  of  Examination of  the  System  Open Market  Account  thatwas distributed on November  3rd.  Are there  any questions  relating tothat?  If  not,  would somebody  like  to  move  its  acceptance?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So move.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  After we completeour general  monetary policy discussion,  I am  going to  raise some  broadissues  about  our recent  intervention  in the  foreign exchange markets.I will  also  comment  about  the alleged  increase  in central  bankparticipation in  the G-7  process.  So,  after  Peter  discusses hisoperations,  let's  hold off discussion  of  the broader  questions withrespect  to  intervention until  later  in  the meeting.  We  will  have moretime  then  for  a general  discussion.  With that  in mind, let me call  onPeter Fisher  to  report  on  foreign currency operations.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  [Statement--See  Appendix.]  Mr.  Chairman,  Iwasn't  quite  sure  how you wanted to  proceed.  I could  take  questionson  the  report, or  I could go  on and ask  for  ratification of  theoperations  and renewal  of the  swap  lines.  Should  I just  go on witheach  of  those?11/15/94-2-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't you do  that?  We will  thenhave  general  questions  on  all  issues  but  leave  the  interventiondiscussion until  later.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I will  need the Committee's  ratification  of  ouroperations  on  Wednesday, November 2;  we  sold $400  million  equivalentof  Japanese yen and $400  million equivalent  of  German marks  for theSystem's Account.  On  November 3, we  sold  $250 million of  yen and  $250million  of  marks  for  the  System's  Account.  Thus,  over  the period wesold $650  million equivalent  of  each of  the  two  currencies for  theSystem Account.Mr.  Chairman,  the  System's  reciprocal currency arrangementsare  up  for  renewal  for  another year with the  exception of  our Mexicanand  Canadian arrangements.  I have  no changes  to  suggest  in  the  termsand  conditions of  the  existing swap  arrangements and  request  that  theCommittee  approve  their renewal without  change.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  just  say this.  If  anyone  objectsto voting  until we have  had our  discussion on intervention, we  candelay  the vote.  If  anybody wants  to  object,  object now and we  willjust postpone the  vote.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I would appreciate  it  if  the  swap vote  couldbe delayed until  later.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  fine.  In  fact,  there  is  acertain symmetry in doing  that.  So  why don't we  leave  that vote  untillater?I was  a little  curious myself as  to why  the  dollar was asstrong  as  it was yesterday.  You  implied that  the  reason was becausethe  foreign exchange market  expected us  to move today.  But  last weekand  two weeks  ago they  expected us  to move today.  What  is  theexplanation?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I admit  it  is  rather hard to  fathom.  I think itis  this  combination of  foreign demand surprising  the  dealer communitywhich has  for  some  time now been playing  the  dollar  from  the  shortside.  I think  the  two  factors  continue  to  operate  together.  Thesurprising  election result  last  Wednesday produced precisely thatsequence,  that  is,  the  resulting  foreign demand for  the  dollarsurprised the  U.S. dealer  community a bit  and the  dealers  rushed tocover shorts.  Monday morning, the  same  thing  seemed to  be  occurringagain.  The dealers  saw a slightly surprising level  of  foreigninterest  in  the  dollar and  the  dealer community once  again tried toplay catch-up with their  customers,  as  best  I have been  able  tounderstand.  There was  a rather quick mark-up yesterday.  If  you lookat  the  charts,  it  really happened rather quickly.  I have  not  beenable  to ascertain what  in particular was  happening at  that  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Peter, you  indicated that you inferredfrom  the market  that we  are behind the  curve  in  three  areas  and  thatwe are  in  striking distance of  reaching at  least  one  or more of  thosecurves.  Is  there any view within  the  foreign  exchange market  thatputs  federal  funds  numbers  on  that?11/15/94-3-

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  very fact  that we  are effectively at  parityon  the  funds  rate with German rates  suggests  that  any move we  make nowwill  give  the dollar  a cost-of-carry  advantage against  the mark.  Oneof  the  things  that  some people  talk about  and that  I perceive asimportant  is  that  the  foreign exchange market  generally  is notfocusing on  that.  That  is,  during the  spring, that was  the  "be-all-and-end-all"  of  the exchange  markets.  People  talked about  the pointin  time when  fed funds  would be  higher than  overnight German rates.  Ithink that  that  is  in  effect  the  sleeper that could catch up with thepoints  above German overnight  rates  as  we went  into year-end,  thatwould begin to  shift  the  whole dynamic  of  leads  and lags  in  corporatedeposits  and the  like.  That  again would slightly shift  the burden ofproof  to  the  speculative  community.  If  they  start  to  lose money byrunning a short dollar position on  cost-of-carry, that will  begin towork on  their  calculations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any other questions?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Peter,  your remarks suggested  that  some  tradersview intermediate- and long-term U.S.  Treasury rates  as  not being at  ahigh  enough level.  That  differs  from a feeling that  a policy actionby  this  Committee  to  increase  the  funds  rate will  at  least  temporarilydepress  bond prices.  Which is  it?  Are  they  saying that  the  level  isnot  yet high  enough or  are  they waiting  until  that  last  shoe  isdropped so  they don't  get  caught holding an  unwanted long position?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Let me answer  that  in  a couple  of ways.  Itobviously varies  depending on  the  institution.  The point  is  that  theFed being perceived as  behind  each of  those  curves  means  it  is  ratherhard to  justify and means  that  foreign demand  is  around the  corner.There  are  extraordinarily high real  returns  in  foreign bond markets,and that  is  a cause  of  major concern  to  our European counterparts.There  are  incredibly high yields  in  France at  present and German realyields  simply calculated are  extraordinarily high.  That  in  itself  isthe problem.  One way of  looking at  the problem  is  to  ask wheninvestors will  be prepared  to  buy our bonds.  For  example,  if  therewere to be  a  sense  of  stability  and the  sense  that a capital  gain wasavailable  in  the  intermediate  term,  that  might  overcome the  lack of  areal  bond yield advantage  for  the dollar.  I don't  mean to  suggestthat  it  is  a necessary  condition  for  the Fed  to  be  ahead of  each andevery one  of  the  curves.  Rather,  the  negative sentiment  is  premisedon  the  fact  that,  no matter what  the analytic  frame  of  mind,  one canlook at  the  exchange market  and see  that  the  Fed  is  behind each  andevery one  of  the  curves.  That's  been feeding  on  the market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions?  If  not,  we'll  goon  to  Joan Lovett.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Do you  want to  ratify  the  foreign  operations ordo  you want  to  save  that  for  later  also?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We will  save  that  for  later  on.  Inother words,  until  we  have  the  discussion,  it would be  inappropriateto  vote on  the ratification.  Joan.

[SECTION]

MS. LOVETT.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--SeeAppendix.]11/15/94

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Joan, was  that  4.79  percent  the  federalfunds  rate  average  since  the  last  FOMC meeting?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  is  it  so  far  this  month?  Do youremember?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  For the  month  of  November?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The month of  November  to  date.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  I don't know  the precise  average, but  it  is  onthe high  side,  because after  its  rise at  the  end of  the  quarter  therate never  really went  back down.  The  last  statement week ended on  afirm note and  it  was  a holiday on  Friday.  With expectations  of a  ratemove  at  this  meeting today,  the  funds  rate has  been persistently abovethat  average.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So  it  would be more  than 4.79  percent?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would  it  be 4.82,  4.83  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The month-to-date effective  rate  is  4.81 percent,Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  For November.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  For November, okay.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That  5.11  percent  futures  rate  implies  5.34percent  for  the  remainder of  the  month.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  You  did my calculations  for  me,  Ithank you.  Any further questions  for  Joan?  If  not,  would somebodylike  to  move to  ratify the  actions  of  the domestic Desk  since  the  lastmeeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let's now move  on  toMike  Prell  and  the  staff  report  on  the  economic  outlook.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--SeeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Mike?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  The profile  that you have for  growth  over thenext  15  months  or so  I find  somewhat puzzling.  The  economy has  a  fairamount  of  momentum, and yet you have  a rather  significant  falloff  inthe  rate  of  growth out  into  next year with a yield curve  that  is  stillsloping upward.  I think  that you would have  to have more  flatteningof  the yield  curve to  get  this  dramatic  a  slowdown.  That's  one piecethat  is  puzzling.  The  other part of  it,  even  if  you are  right,  isreminiscent  of  the  late  1980s.  If  you  take growth  down to  1 to  1-1/211/15/94percent, if  it  really does  get  that weak, you  open yourself up  to  anykind of  a shock.  I'm puzzled on both  sides:  one,  that we will  getthis  amount of  slowing with  the  kind  of  increase  in  rates  that  youtalk  about;  and on  the  other side,  if we  actually do end up  with thiskind of  slowing,  then you can  argue that we are  vulnerable  on  the downside.  So  I have  two opposite  concerns.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  President Boehne,  I think the  first question  ismore  a forecasting  question.  The second one perhaps  is  more  a policyquestion,  though there  are obviously  ingredients of  both  in  the  twoquestions.  We hinted  in  the  Greenbook  that,  in  essence, we  see  theprobability distribution  as  skewed a bit  in  the direction your  firstquestion suggested--that,  indeed, the momentum could turn  out  to bebetter maintained in  the near  term and  that  it might take  considerablygreater monetary policy  tightening  in  order  to  generate  a quick andsignificant  slackening in  growth, bringing the  economy below potentialand beginning to  reverse what we regard as  an  overshooting in  resourceutilization.  So,  I take your point,  and while  I don't  think historywould suggest that  a moderation in growth requires  a total  flatteningof  the  yield curve,  I would  say that  perhaps we are  a bit  optimistic,if you want  to view it  that way, on  that relationship.  The  Greenbookassumes  a reduction  in  the upward  slope, but  the  latter  is  stillsignificant.  If  I had  to  pick an  alternative  scenario,  I might  leanin  the  direction you are  talking about.As  to  slow growth and openness  to  shocks,  the economy  isalways  open to  a shock that  could move  it  off  the projected path by agiven amount.  When growth is  that  low,  such a shock obviously  couldmove  the  economy  into negative  territory.  Maybe the psychology ofthat  is  different  and downward momentum might  develop,  but  I don'tthink we  have a way of coping with that.  In  fact,  in  1989-1990, wedid have  a period  of  slow growth.  There were some  revisions  of  datawhich revealed just what  the pattern was,  and  it wasn't until  thatshock occurred that  the  economy really  tipped into  recession.  In theabsence of  that  shock, it  is  conceivable we might  have  skated by.  Aperiod  of  slow growth does  not necessarily mean that  the  economy  isgoing to  slip  into a recession.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike, in your verbal presentation and also  in  theGreenbook you  twice  referred to  more lenient  lending terms  by banks  asa factor  in the  strength of  the  economy.  I want  to  make sure  Iunderstand the point.  Are  you saying  that banks  are more  lenient  thanone  typically would see  at  this  stage  of  the  cycle,  or  is  this  justwhat we  typically see?  My own  discussions with bankers  suggest  thatthey are not doing anything unique  for  this  cycle.  As  a matter  offact,  I think that  in  some respects  they are  a little more cautious.Are you  seeing something exogenous  to  what our  experience has  been inthe past  at  this  stage  of  the  cycle?  If  so,  how important  is  it?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  This  is  hard to  pin down, but my  sense  is  thatthe  credit availability cycle has been  out  of  sync with  the normalpattern  this  time around.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  A little  later?11/15/94-6-

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In  the  sense  that,  when interest  rates  werecoming  down  in  1991-1992,  we were  still  seeing  the  tendency towardtightening  of bank credit  terms.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  And, as  we have  been  tightening money marketconditions,  our  loan officers'  survey and the preponderance of  theanecdotal  evidence have suggested that  the banks  have becomeincreasingly aggressive in  their business lending  and obviously havebeen  increasingly willing  to  extend consumer credit as  well.  Welooked back at  the  responses  to  that  same  senior  loan officers'  surveysome years  back through a couple of  cycles and found that,  as we mighthave expected, during periods  of  rising  interest  rates  and aflattening  term structure, some  of  which we have had, we generally hada tightening of  credit terms;  but  recently we had a tendency toward  aneasing in  credit  terms.  So,  I think we may be moving  in an unusualdirection.  Be  that  as  it  may, we  are pretty much  convinced that wehave been moving  in the  direction of  easier credit availability andthat that has  tended to  work against  the  effect  of  the rising  interestrates  on  demand.  From the  perspective of  businesses,  it  is  certainlyclear  that  the credit crunch  is  no  longer there  and creditavailability is  not  a concern  to  firms  that want  to  expand their  fixedinvestment or  inventories.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  I guess  I'm a little  surprised  that  in  the pastwe have  seen  a tightening of  terms  in  the  first  year of  risinginterest rates.  I would have  thought  that  it would have  come  later.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I don't want  to put  too  fine a point  on  it,  but  Ithink the  main point  is  that  this seems  to  have been an  offsettinginfluence  over the  past year  to  the  rising market  interest rates.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  I don't  think there  is  any doubt  about  that.  Ireally wonder  if  that's unique.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  not.  There  is  a bias  in  themeasure  of  the degree  of  ease  in  the  loan  officers'  survey.  What  isthe  size  of  it?  Do you remember, Don?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  The Richmond Fed did a study  once  that  showedthat,  at  least  back  in the  1970s,  it  looked like  the  responses  werebiased toward  showing  tightness.  Now, the  psychology of  everythinghas  shifted  so radically  in the  current  cycle that  I wonder whetherthat same bias  is  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  trouble  is  that  if  you cumulated thefirst  differences, you got  a progressively greater  degree  oftightening, which at  the end  of  the  day should have  strangled thetotal  financial  system.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right.  That was  true back in  the  1970s when thebias was  found.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In other words,  there is  no evidencethat  that has been  the case  since then?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We  just don't  know.11/15/94

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mike,  I've got  two  quite  different types  ofquestions.  The  first  one  has  two parts  and it  is  about productivity:What  has  been going on  and what  do you  foresee going on?  In  the  pastfour quarters,  growth  in manufacturing productivity is  reported to  besomething  on  the  order of  6 percent  or  so,  and for  the  overall  economyit  is  substantially less  than  that--the  rest  of  the economy  onlyrunning about  1-1/2  percent.  A large part of  that  is  because wedefine output  in such  a way  that we  preclude labor productivity gains,at  least  for  services.  Nevertheless,  we wind up with  some pretty goodnumbers  for  these past  four quarters.  When  I look at  your forecastfor  the next  year--the  first part  of  the  first question  is  how youread  these numbers as  to  what happened with productivity gains  in  themanufacturing  sector being  four times  what  they have been  in  the  restof  the  economy.  Is  it  simply a measurement  error  in that  we don'tknow how to  measure productivity in  the  rest  of  the economy and howdoes  that  affect  judgments about policy?  Or do  you take  those  numbersat  face value?  The  second question  is,  what do  you foresee going onin manufacturing and nonmanufacturing productivity  to produce  the slowgrowth of  under 2 percent in  output  for  four quarters  starting  nextspring?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  As  a technical matter,  the productivity numbersfor manufacturing  that are published along with those  for overallproductivity growth are  in  essence based on a separate  system  in thecurrent period.  The recent period is  based on  industrial productiondata rather than industry gross product  data.  Those numbers  will berevised.  There  isn't any reason, though, to  think  that  they aregiving a grossly misleading picture.  Our assumption  is  that,  indeed,there has been  substantial growth in manufacturing productivity.  I'mnot  sure you want  to  subtract  that  number  from overall nonfarmbusiness sector productivity growth  and get  the  residual  for  the  restof  the  economy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Actually, Mike, when we separate  the  GDPinto  its  factory value  components, don't we get  results that are notall  that different  from numbers based on  industrial production?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  There's  a big gap between the  industrial  and thenonindustrial  sector productivity measures even when we  do  thisexercise.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Maybe that  isn't  actually true;  maybe  there  is  aninaccuracy  in the measurement  of  output.  It  would be affecting  theGDP numbers.  It  also would be  affecting our estimates  of  potentialoutput growth.  It  is  in  fact neutral  in  terms  of  assessing what  theoutput gap might be.  All  the measures  are commensurately affected.As  to  the  pattern we have going  forward, we  do have a deceleration ofproductivity growth.  This  is  a normal  accompaniment  to  a significantthe  cyclically-adjusted trend  line  and that  deceleration normallyoccurs  in mid-expansion.  As we move  to  fuller resource utilization,the  expansion will  be  slowing;  there will  be  some tendency  to moveback toward that  trend line.  Historically,  the  economy has movedbelow it  during recessionary periods,  but we don't have  a recession  in11/15/94our  projection period.  In  essence, we have a somewhat below-trendgrowth of  nonfarm business productivity over  the  next year or  so  andthen we move  back toward  that  trend.  Basically,  looking at  the  growthof productivity in  the  1990s,  we don't  see  any  real  evidence  that ourassumption  for  some  time now of  about  1.4  percent  trend growth  innonfarm business productivity is  off  the  mark.  The  data  seem to  beconforming  to  that  in  terms  of  the  normal  cyclical  pattern.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Just  as a comment  on  it,  I'm not  hearinganything that  suggests  to me  that businesses--manufacturing or  others--foresee  fewer opportunities  for productivity improvements  in  thenext year or  two  than  they have had in  the  last couple  of  years.  Whatproduces  this quite  dramatic  slowing  of  productivity?  I think  thisis  troubling.The  second question is  more  involved--sorry about  this.  WhenI pair up what  has happened in  the  last  four quarters and yourprojection out  to mid-1995,  it  looks  like  a pattern that  says,  becauseoutput  has grown  faster  than projected, say, at  this  time  a year agoand also  faster  than  some  ideas  about potential, what  we have  to do  isgive  it  back  so  that,  in the  end, we wind up  at  the  same  level  ofoutput  and employment  as we would have otherwise.  Another way oflooking at  this  same  situation  is  to pair up  this  last year with  theprior year.  Instead of matching off a year  in  the  future, match  off  ayear in  the past.  We went  through  a period  in 1992  and much of  1993of  downward revisions  in  forecasts--staff,  Blue Chip,  everybody else;the  forecasting errors were  on  the  down side  in relation toexpectations about what  the  economy was  capable  of  doing.  If  you dothat matching up of  1993  and 1994,  the  level  today comes  out aboutwhere you would have projected  it  two  years ago.  Then, if  you don'thave  to give  anything back in  the  future, the  question  is  what  ishappening  to growth  in  the  future.In your  framework, when you talk  about  inflation, you rely onexcess  demand.  I puzzle  over what  is  producing this  idea  of  excessdemand.  Nominal GDP growth really has  not accelerated  that much.  Infact,  it  looks  the same  for  the  last  four  quarters as  it  looked in1992.  To  put  it  into  terms  that  I feel  more  comfortable with, I tryto  reconcile  your  forecast with what  I think  is  going  on with moneyand  the  desire  to  hold money balances.  At  least conceptually,  I canmake equivalent  an  excess-demand-for-output model  and an excess-supply-of-money model.  How well  that can be done  depends  on what  isgoing on  in  asset markets.  But  conceptually, we can make  the  two  thesame.  A year  ago at  this  time,  I said that  the  opportunity cost  modelfor narrow money, M1,  or  for  the  monetary base, was  tracking verywell;  nothing had gone wrong.  We had had two  years  of  double-digitgrowth  of M1  and the base.  At  that point a year ago,  we had fouroptions  for  the  year ahead:  One was  that  the  relationship would breakdown;  we don't  want  to  make monetary policy on  the  idea  of  therelationship breaking down,  so  put  that  one aside.  That  left  threepossibilities.  One was  a further sharp decline  in  interest rates.  Itwould have taken  a 20-25  percent  decline  in  interest  rates  from wherewe  were a year  ago to  make  the  opportunity cost model hold up, giventhe  kind of  money growth we were  getting and  the  forecast  you had.  Atthat  time, you  thought  that  there  was  some possibility of  furtherpercent.  I actually would have leaned on  the  side  of  thinking that  ifinflation psychology  improved, bond yields  could have  too.  I do11/15/94remember  the Chairman  saying he would have been  shorting  the bondimprovement didn't happen.  So  that  left  the  other  two possibilities:Either nominal GDP  growth doubled,  shot  up to  about  10  or 12  percent,or M1  growth  and base  growth  collapsed.  What we got  was a combinationof  the  two with a small  increase of  1 percent  in  nominal GDP growthand mostly a drop  in money growth--M1  and  the base.  The  opportunitycost model  still  fit.So here we  are  now and as  I look  ahead, we've  got fouroptions:  One is  that  the relationship breaks  down;  hold  that  aside.Second, I can come  at  it  one of  two ways.  I can  look at yourGreenbook forecast  and the  Prell  path of  policy and ask if  this  isreasonable  for  interest  rates  and money growth  if  the model  stillworks.  That would say to  me  that  if  interest  rates  remained attoday's  level  and your Greenbook  forecast was  right, M1  growth wouldrelationship holds.  Or,  if  your  fed  funds  recommendations  arecorrect,  that  implies  that M1  growth has  to  drop about  6 percentagepoints  in absolute  level  in  the  next year  for your nominal  GDPforecast  to  be  correct.  Is  that  reasonable?  What's  going  on  in  thedemand  for money balances  for  the  velocity to  have  to  increase  about10  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't  think I can work my way through  all  thehistory you gave  on the  forecast.  But  I think  the  first  statement  youmade  about  giving back  the  extra growth  that we had  recently isfundamentally correct.  That  extra growth,  as  we  assess  it,  resultedin  an  overshooting of  sustainable  levels  of resource  utilization--levels that would be  consistent with at  least  stability in  inflationas  opposed to  accelerating prices.  We  tried to  devise  a scenario  inwhich, within a reasonable period of time,  we move back  to  andslightly above the  NAIRU to  damp  the  incipient  inflationary process.I think  that  is  an apt  characterization of  how this  scenario  isdesigned.I hope Don has  some  thoughts  on  the M1  velocity story.  It  isnot  something we  focused on,  frankly,  in designing  the  forecast.  Wedidn't  give  any attention to  M1.  M1  is  an  endogenous byproduct  inthis  forecast  just  like many other variables.  There  can't  conceivablybe  any tension  in  our  thinking  about  the  money and  incomerelationship.  It  is  whatever it  is,  and we  don't  have  an M1 targetrange  that we need to  worry about violating,  so  that  doesn't  arise  asa side  constraint,  and we  think  the broader aggregates will  remain atgrowth rates  that  are  compatible with  the  1995  ranges and anyreasonable extensions.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  In  fact,  you're  right,  President Jordan,  in  thesense  that  the M1  that we have  been getting  for the  last  two years  orso  has  been pretty much  on the  M1  demand curve.  But  that  aggregate,of  course,  is  very interest  elastic.  We are predicting even  slowergrowth next year  than  the  2 percent  that  we have  for  this  year  andanother hefty increase  in  velocity.  I have  to  admit  that  our  modelssuggest  that  if  the same  relationships hold, M1 might  even drop  nextyear  consistent with  the  Greenbook GDP  and  interest rates.  We haveprojected essentially no  growth.  We don't  have  the  drop built  in, butI couldn't  rule  out  the possibility  that we  could get  the Greenbook11/15/94-10-GDP  and a decline in M1.  It  would be  right  on  the model  and not  asurprise.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  If  the money demand relation still holds  on M1and you get  a 5 or  6 percent drop  in  the  absolute  level  of M1,  whatdoes  that  do  to  your M2?  Unless  you've  got non-M1  components of M2starting to  take off  suddenly--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We  do have  opportunity costs narrowing over thelatter half  of  next  year, and we  do  have M2  picking up then.  We  seethose costs  rising  in  the  first  half  of  the  year when we expect verydamped growth in M2.  As you can  see  in your Bluebook, we have  builtin declines  through March.  We  do  have a bit  stronger growth built  infor  next year partly because  some  of  the  special  factors,  like  thereduction of  demand deposits  stemming from  the  fade  out  of  mortgagerefinancings,  will not  be  there.  So,  we do  have a littlestrengthening next year as  things  come a little more  into  line withour models.  In  fact  our models  for M2,  based on  the  same  interestrates and the  same  incomes, predict much stronger  growth  in M2  nextyear  than this year.  We trimmed  it by a percentage point  or  two,  sowe only have  2 percent  growth.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  An opposite  question to  President  Boehne's:  Iwas  interested in  the  reference  in  the  Greenbook to  the  cessation ofspeed effects  that  brings about  the moderation of  CPI  increases  in thelast part  of  1995.  I wondered whether you had any estimates  of whatthat  CPI  figure might be  absent speed effect changes?  Did you look  atit  that way?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't  think we  can do  a precise dissection.One  of  the  things we've pointed out  in  the  Greenbook is  that  inlooking at  the  acceleration--I don't want  to  overstate  this--what weare  talking  about  in essence  in  the  core  CPI  number  is  that we aregoing to  get  pretty much  .3 increase a month rather  than a mixture  of.2 and  .3 a month.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes,  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Whether we'll  be  able  to  perceive this  month-by-month isn't  entirely clear.  But we see  this  as  involving  a mix ofthings  that  are  sort  of  overlapping.  We have had an  exchange ratedepreciation.  We have  seen  raw materials  prices  increase.  Some  ofthose  raw materials  are  internationally traded and are imported  insome  instances.  We  have seen  rapid growth  of  output  recently, andeconometrically, while  it  is  not  always a particularly robust  result--you can  tinker with your models and get  large  or  small  effects--thatmere  increase  in resource utilization  can produce  in these models  someincrease  in markups,  and when things  taper off  we see  some  stabilizingand a return  to  the  trend.  I really can't parse  these  things  out withany great precision.  Some  set  of  these  factors we  think will  give  alittle bit  faster rise  in prices  in the near term  than would bedictated simply by the margin of  slack  in  the  economy, which we wouldsee  as  only adding maybe a couple  of  tenths  to  underlying  inflationover  the coming year, no more than  that.11/15/94-11-

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  So  you  think  it  is  more  the  special  factorsthat  are pushing  the  increase  in prices  to  3.8  and 3.6  percent  ratherthan  any uptrend?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Right.  We  have  a  timing question here.  It  ishard to  say but we  think that  we might  get  a  little more  of  the priceincrease  announcements  at  the beginning  of  the year.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  So,  there  is  a  considerable amount  of  guessworkinvolved here.  But, yes,  I think  it  is  these  speed effects  or  theexchange  rate  effects  on  import  prices  and  so on  that  are  giving  thebulge.  However,  if we did not  eliminate  the  excess pressures  onresources during  1995,  as we have  in  this  forecast,  the  risk would bethat  wages would begin  to  reflect  more  fully the  higher priceincreases,  inflationary expectations would  take hold, and we  wouldbegin to  build that  higher  track into  the  trend.  That's why we  feltit  important  to  try to  indicate what  kind of  interest rate path wouldlead  to  this  slackening  fairly promptly.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Looking  at  the  other  side,  you have  a decliningimpact  from  inventories, but certainly  a smooth  one.  Do you  care  tocomment  on  that?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Reality will  never be  that  smooth!

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That's what  we  thought  too!

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That's  one  of  the  risks we  noted in  theGreenbook.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  An  inventory adjustment  could come  more quickly:If  final  demand were  to  taper  off  and be perceived to  have  tapered offearly next year,  perhaps  the  inventory adjustment  would be  sharper.That  could move us  much closer  to  zero  or  even conceivably negativeGDP growth  for a quarter, but  inventories might  then come  back  iffinal  demand  is  still  growing moderately.  So,  they  are  certainly apotential  source  of volatility  in  the numbers  and  of  some  greatercyclical variation.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Finally, have  you  looked at  the price  effectwhen  the ARMs  that  were  issued this  year kick  in next year?  Theteaser rates  this  year have been very low.  Some  of  these ARMs  havenew provisions  to  extend the maturity, but a good portion of  them willkick  in next  year.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It  is  going to  be  a  factor affecting  the  cashflow of  many households, but  it  is  not a huge effect.  It  is  less  hugethan  one might  have  expected because what we've  observed this  year  isthat  a substantial  proportion of  the ARMs  originated this  year havefixed rates  for  5 or  10  years.  This  is  something of  an  innovation  inthis  cycle.  We  are not  going  to have  any  adjustment  on those  andthere  is  a 2 percentage point  limit  on  those shorter-term ARMs.  So,this  is  not going  to  produce  a drastic  income  shock in  1995.11/15/94-12-

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Mike,  I want  to  ask you  a question  about  theprojection for  the  automobile market, which  in  the Greenbook ispeaking  this  quarter  at  about  15-1/2 million  light vehicles--cars  andtrucks--and then declining very modestly, almost  trivially.  In  theGreenbook, short-term  interest  rates  are up  150  basis points  more.  Inaddition,  it  is  been  a notable  feature of  this  episode,  I think,  thatauto  loan rates  have  gone up  only about  half--or less--as  much asimplies  about  the  future  of  auto  loan rates  and  for  the  responsivenessof purchases  to  auto  loan  rates.  Furthermore, as  I look  at  the  realdisposable  income  forecast,  it  is  also peaking  this quarter.  Then,  inthe  first  three quarters  of  1995,  while  the  auto  industry  is  barelyshowing a dent  in  sales,  real  disposable  income  growth rates  are goingto  2.2,  0.9,  and 1.7  percent.  The question  is  how do  you  square  thatcircle?  What's  going on with autos  in this  forecast?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think we have  a forecast  that  is  middle-of-the-road.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That's  the question;  why  is  it  in  the middle!

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  A view that  is  certainly held in  the  industry isthat  there  is  considerable pent-up  demand that  could buoy sales  ofautomobiles  and  light  trucks  but  such demand really has  not  been  fullyseen yet  because  of  capacity constraints.  We  think  there  is  someelement  of  truth to  that  story.  On  the  other  hand, it  is  true  that,to date, we have had a very moderate response  of  auto  loan  rates  tothe  increase  that  has  occurred  in market  rates.  Prospectively, onewould expect  that  gap  to  close,  and  in addition we  have assumed  somefurther rise  in market  rates.  I must  say that  the rise  in rates  ismost pronounced at  the very short end  of  the market,  and  the  sort ofintermediate-term rates  that  we  typically compare  to auto  loan rateswould not be  going up as much.  We get  some  flattening  in  the yieldcurve here.  So,  in our  thinking, there  is  some  further  increase  inauto  loan rates,  but maybe not  as  dramatic as  one might  think byadding  the  rise  in  the  funds  rate  to  the  gap  that  seems  to  exist  nowbetween market  rates  and auto  loan  rates.  Arguably, that  sort  ofnormal  interest rate  response  could produce  a weaker automobile  marketthan we have.  I think we are  somewhere  in  between, but  I would grantyou  that  the  interest  rate picture might  constitute  a  downside  risk.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I just want  to  mention that  thescrappage model  that was  developed by my former  colleagues  atTownsend-Greenspan is  closely consistent with the  numbers  that we aregetting  from the  income model.  I meant  to  show it  to  you;  I have  acopy.  As  Mike said,  there  is  an  implicit  scrappage  demand elementhere  that  seems  to  be  running stronger  than  the  income  flows  areof  the  demand  for  motor vehicles  is  something like  several  hundredthousand units  per percentage point  in  the  loan rate.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  that's  fair.  One  also could  argue  thatwe do  not have  as  large an  interest  rate  response here as  we  couldhave.  Again,  as  President  Boehne  suggested in his  original  question,11/15/94-13-it  is possible  that  we  have not put  in  enough of  an  increase  ininterest  rates  to  get  the  damping of  aggregate demand in  the Greenbookforecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I had Governor Blinder's question.  But  I hadanother  one  on profits.  You have a very sharp  deceleration  in profitgrowth  in the  forecast, and  I have a cause  and effect question  aboutthat.  The cause  question is  whether the  deceleration is  due  to  anarrowing of  margins.  You were mentioning earlier your perception ofthe  PPI  and the  changes  there.  Secondly, on  the  effects  side,  I amsurprised that  given a very sharp deceleration in  the  outlook  forprofits,  you have  real business  fixed  investment holding up  as  well  asit  is  at very high levels.  Could you also  give me on  the  effects  sideyour perception of  what  this  means  for  equity markets?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Equity markets  clearly have been buoyed,  in  theface of  rising bond yields this year,  by surprisingly favorableearnings reports.  Our anticipation would be  that  those  reports willnot be pleasant  surprises  in  1995.  That  suggests  some vulnerabilityto  the  stock market, at  least  in  the  early part  of  the year before thesignificant bond market rally that we  anticipate occurs.  This patternof  flattening profits  and  diminishing profit share  is  quite consistentwith  the cyclical  pattern of  profits moving with  the acceleration andsense.  As  we go  forward,  as  was noted earlier, we do have  aconsiderable  slackening  in productivity.  We see  some pressure  coming,as  wages accelerate  and productivity flattens  out,  toward certainlyweakening profit margins--maybe not  a pronounced plunge but  somepressure on  them.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  And the  effect  on  investment?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  think that  investment has been benefiting tosome degree from  strong profitability and ample  cash  flows.  As we  goforward, cash  flow does  flatten out.  We do get  a growing nonfinancialcorporate financing  gap, and we do  see  that as  an  element that  will  bedamping business  fixed investment.  Recall  that you are probablylooking at  real numbers  that  are  inflated to  some  degree by thecomputer deflator.  You get rapid growth in real  computer purchaseswith  a zero nominal  increase.  That's  basically what we have  in ourforecast  for  the next  two years.  We  still  think  this  is  a climate  inwhich business  investment  in  computers will  be  fairly robust.  On  thenonresidential  structure side,  we  anticipate  a pretty  solid uptrend.There are  lags  in  this  process.  Permits  have been rising noticeablyrecently.  We think the  uptrend at  this  point  is  unlikely to  bereversed in the  near term by  the  further rise  in  interest  rates.That's  giving some underpinnings  to  this  advance,  and BFI  along withexports are  a couple  of  the  sectors  against which we  are working inreducing the  growth of  other elements  of private  domestic  demand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You will  also remember  that  you  arelooking at  outlays,  not  appropriations.  The  relationship is  closerbetween cash  flow or profit margins  and appropriations.  You can viewoutlays as  sort  of  a distributed  lag  against the  appropriations data.It  is  a quite considerable  lag.11/15/94-14-

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  So  that would begin with 1997?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Mike,  as  I recall  when the  household survey waschanged by the  Labor  Department,  a  lot  of people  anticipated that  atsome point  there  would be a  significant  bump up  in  the unemploymentrate, which has  not materialized.  Is  that  simply because  it  has  beenswamped by employment gains  or what  is  the  explanation for  that?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In  all  likelihood, the  parallel  survey that  wasconducted prior  to  the  first  of  this  year misled the  Labor Department.It  showed  that  the unemployment  rate would be  1/2  percentage pointhigher with the new survey.  The  evidence  from the  survey  that wasconducted afterwards  using  the  old  relationships  to  other  series  suchas  the unemployment  insurance data  and payroll employment  seriessuggests  that  somehow  or other  that  parallel  survey was  misleading--perhaps  a  fluke  statistically--and that  the  gap between  the  old  andthe new series  is  probably very small,  maybe no more  than  .1 withanother upward estimate  of  .1 for  the  change  in census  populationcontrols.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions  for Mike?  ViceChairman McDonough, did you have a question?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  No questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  Do you want  to start  our  tour  detable?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Whenever  you are ready.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Okay.  You can  start  off.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Let me begin, Mr.  Chairman, withjust  a brief  remark about  the  goings  on  in  the  Second District.  TheNew York State  economy is  continuing  to grow but  at  a  slightly  slowerrate than  that  of  the  nation.  The major source  of  strength  is  theconsumer.  Retail  sales have been strong and  the  sales  of  existinghouses  have been quite  high.  Needless  to  say, there  is  greatuncertainty about  the  fiscal  future  of  the  state.  The new governorinherits  a  $4 billion hole  in  a 1995  budget of  $34  billion, but  hecontinues  to promise  to  cut  taxes.  New York  City dwellers wonderabout how well  the  city will  fare  given  the  dynamics  of  the  recentcampaign.  So,  I think any  investment decisions  in which  the  state taxburden  is  an  issue will  almost  certainly be put  on hold.The  banks  in  the  District  are  lending very aggressively, andthat  seems  to  reflect  a combination  of  two  things.  Regional  banksboth inside  and outside  the  Second District  seem to  be  trying  toincrease market  share.  Secondly,  the money center banks  that  in somecases  have had a considerable reduction, modest  in  others,  of  theirtrading  income  seem to be  somewhat more  aggressive  in  lending  in  orderto  improve  their  earnings.  The  spreads  are  sufficiently low now thatit  is  not clear  to me  that  they are getting an  adequate  return  oncapital  from  such activity.  There  is  no  question  in my view that11/15/94-15-their  lending  standards,  as  evidenced by  the covenants  being requiredof  their  borrowers,  are  slipping excessively.Switching  to  the national  economy,  the question we have beenasking ourselves  is:  What do  we know that  we didn't  know at  the  lastmeeting  of  this  Committee?  Well,  the  first  thing we know is  thatcurrent  and recent GDP  and employment  growth  are  even  stronger  than mycolleagues  at  the New York Bank  and I thought  would be  the  case at  thetime  of  the  last  meeting.  That  is  the  case  both as  regards  the  thirdquarter, which came  in  stronger, and our view of  the  current  quarter,which we have  ratcheted up  even more.  Second, we believe  that  even ifinventory  investment slows  enough  so  that  it  becomes  a modest drag  onthe  economy, real  growth will  stay above  3 percent  through  most of1995.  We  do not  have  growth  slowing  in  1995  and  1996  as  much as  theGreenbook does.  Third,  the  interest-sensitive areas  are  in fact  majorcontributors  to  growth  and show very  little  response  to  higherinterest rates,  even  though one  must  state,  of  course,  that  the  fulleffect  of  the  tightening  to  date  has  not yet been  felt.  Automobilesales  are strong,  and  if  General Motors  could straighten out  some ofits  production problems,  they would be  even  stronger.  Housing isrobust.  The  fourth  thing we  think we  know now that  we didn't  knowthen is  that  the  surge  in average hourly earnings  in  October of  0.7percent is  not  traceable  to  unusual  factors.  The Bureau  of  LaborStatistics'  announcement of  a pending major  upward revision in  payrollemployment  means  that  the  help that  we  thought we would get  fromproductivity is  much  lower,  causing an  upward revision  in  the  trend oflabor  costs.  Fifth, even  though medical  costs  were beginning  to  bebetter behaved before  the  health care debate  of  the  last  18  months,  wedo not  think that  the  improvement  in medical  costs  and therefore  thecost  of  benefits  to  employers  will  continue  to  be  a help incontrolling  inflation.  Sixth,  the  rate  of  unemployment  in our  view isbelow the NAIRU, which we think  is  6 percent,  give  or  take  0.1.  Wecould be wrong.  Since unemployment  is  now below 6 percent  and  the  CPIis  rather well  behaved,  the  question could be asked,  is  God kinder  andhas  the NAIRU become  lower?  We don't  think so.  History in  the  late1970s  and  in  the  late  1980s  gives us  a lesson,  we believe.  At  thosetimes  there was hope  that  the  NAIRU would come down.  Certainly in  thelate  1980s  it was  thought  that  it  would come down somewhere within  arange  of  5 to  5-1/2  percent.  Unfortunately. those hopes  turned  out  tobe  ill  founded.  I think that what was  overlooked  is  that  monetarypolicy works with a considerable  lag and  inflation, when it  starts,doesn't  leap  out  of  its  cave;  it  starts  rather  slowly and  almostimperceptibly.In  the meantime,  have  the  financial  markets  given us  any newinformation?  The  first  thing  that  I think we should  all pay noattention  to  is  the  zigs  and  zags  of  the  financial markets  from  oneday  to  the next  as  they absorb  the most  recent data and as  35-year  oldbond dealers  make profound remarks  to  the media.  What  I think thethat  our  tightening to  date  has not reduced  those  expectations.  Onecan  look  at  a variety of  places on  the  yield curve  to measureinflationary expectations  or  look at  consumer  surveys  and  so  on.  Wefind  the  spread between  3-year  and 1-year Treasuries  a very helpfulindicator in  large part because  it  covers  just  the period during whichmonetary policy should have  its  effect  initially on  inflationaryexpectations.  That  spread has  jumped around  because  of  the volatilityof  markets  this year, but  on average  it  has  stayed quite  steadily11/15/94-16-around 85  basis points  despite  the  choppiness.  It  has  not  improved;it  has not  narrowed as  a result  of  the  tightening since  the  4th ofI suppose  I should really  stop  there,  but  I think that  theGreenbook and Mike's presentation place  the  stance  of  monetary policyrather  front  and center.  At  the  last meeting, we decided  that  it  wasappropriate  to  have an asymmetric directive, which  the world will  knowabout  this Friday.  That meant  that  we were  ready during  theintermeeting period, when we  didn't  know all  those  new things  that wethink we now know, to  increase  the  fed funds  rate  and perhaps  thediscount rate by 50  basis  points.  We think  that because of  all  theadditional  information available  since  the  last meeting, such  a movewould no longer be adequate.  It  could in  fact increase  inflationaryexpectations not  because young bond dealers would raise  questions, butbecause  sensible people  could question the  resoluteness  of  thisCommittee.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, New England continues  to  recovergradually.  But  there is  a distinction to be drawn between  theincoming  labor market  data  and other indicators,  so  I'll  try  to  framemy  comments  about New England along those  two  lines.  Unlike most ofthe  rest  of  the country, New England has  not yet  recovered the jobslost  in  the  last  recession  and is  not  expected to  do  so  until  late1998  at  best.  There  is  a continued  lull  in  growth that  I commented onat the  last meeting, and  it  is  hardly as welcome  in  New England  as  itmight be  for  the  country as  a whole.  Payroll  employment declined infive  of  the  six New England states  in  September, putting the  region'sestablishment  job count  slightly below its  July level.  But  it  isstill  nearly 2 percent  over a year  earlier.  Massachusetts and NewHampshire  continue to  reflect  the  strongest  growth rates  among the  sixstates,  and Connecticut still  bumps  along on  the bottom.  Theunfortunately, but all  the major  industry categories  exceptconstruction and government recorded declines.  Unemployment  rosenoticeably in  the region  in October, also  in contrast  to  the  nationalscene.  Prices  and wages seem to  be  rising somewhat  more  slowly in  theregion than  in  the nation, and  the residential  real  estate markets  aredefinitely slowing.To  round out  this  rather downbeat picture,  trends in  defense-related business also  show  deterioration relative to  the nationalpicture.  For  example, prime defense contract  awards  to New Englandcompanies during  the  first  half  of  1994  were  lower  than  at  any timesince  1980  and 35  percent below their  1989  peak.  Defense-relatedemployment  continues  to  decline  and in  some  states  the  decline  isnearly  twice  the  national pace and probably accounts  for a healthyshare  of  the  manufacturing job  losses  I noted earlier.Moving  from  the  labor market  data  to other  indicators,however, consumer confidence,  help wanted advertising, and retailsales  all  show continued  improvement  in New England.  Retailerscontacted for  the  Beigebook, especially  those selling hard goods, wereupbeat about  recent activity and the  near-term outlook.  I must  admitthat  every business group  I meet with seems  to  be much more positivethan  the  incoming labor  data would make me believe.  More  than  5011/15/94-17-percent  of  any  group  I have talked  to  in  the  past month  or  two  arecontemplating  hiring people over  the  next  12  months  and out  into  thefuture;  they  are seeing  escalating  input prices  and are  seriouslyconsidering  raising prices  in  response  to  these  escalating prices,probably along  the  lines  of  the  January price  increases  that  werementioned in  the  Greenbook.In sum, New England  faces  considerable sectoral  challenges--defense,  the  computer industry, health care--which  tend to  drag  downthe  data.  But  there  are sources  of  growth and ebullience  emerging.On  the  national  scene, we  agree with  the Greenbook'sinference  that  the  economic  expansion has overshot.  We  expectemployment  costs  as  measured by the  ECI  to  turn up soon,  and we  agreethat  near-term inflation prospects  are not  optimal.  I've  covered ourconcerns  about  the  Greenbook  in  the  questions  that  I had for Mike, butoverall  we  don't  find  a lot  to  complain  about.  We  seem  to  be  slightlyfurther behind the  curve  than  I would have liked at  this  point and  thelonger we wait  and fail  to  slow  the  economy, the  greater  the  chancethat  rates will  need to be  significantly higher.  If  we  don't  increaserates at  this  meeting,  I see  a real  chance  of  causing the  boom-bustcycle  that  we have been  trying  to  avoid.  I think  the risks  are  on  theup side,  and  I think we have  to  move  sharply and  fast  to  curb  thoserisks.  I'm in  agreement with  President  McDonough  that  that  moveshould  take place  at  this  meeting.

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman, as  I have  been reporting  forseveral  meetings now,  the  Southeast  economy is  sustaining  a broad-based expansion, although we  have  seen  a little  slowing  of  growthrecently.  There really hasn't  been very much change  in  the  situationin  the  Sixth District  since  the  last  meeting,  so  I'm  not going  torepeat  a lot  of  the  detail  that  I have given  at  the  last  couple  ofmeetings.  Let me hit  just  a couple  of highlights.Retail  sales  rebounded  in  October after  a somewhat  lowereven record increases,  in  sales  over  the holidays.  According to  ourlatest manufacturing  survey, activity was  not quite as  robust  inand  shipments  to  be  higher  six months  out.  Single-family home  salesslowed in  most  of  the  District  last  month, dropping below stronglevels  seen  a year ago.  On the  other hand, multifamily real  estategoing  on  for a while.  Commercial real  estate  markets clearly have  hitbottom and are beginning  to  move up.  We are  beginning  to  hear somereports  of  speculative building  in that  sector,  particularly inAtlanta.  Bank  loans  overall  are growing modestly  for  the  first  timethis  year, although  I  find it  interesting that  consumer  loans  are  flatin the  District.  Employment  growth picked up  a little  in  the  thirdquarter with services,  trade,  construction,  and durables manufacturingshowing  the best  gains.  More reports  of wage  and price pressures  arecoming in  than before.  The wage pressures  are  concentrated for  themost part  in  a  few  localities and  in  a  few areas.  Respondents in  ourmanufacturing  survey are reporting pressures  on prices  of  inputs  andfinished  goods,  and they are  expecting to  be  able  to  pass  thosethrough  later  on.  Again, although  retailers  have  held the  line  so11/15/94-18-far,  prices  are  expected to  increase as  new shipments  come  in afterthe  first  of  the  year.In sum,  the  situation  in  the  Sixth District is  not verydifferent  from what  it  was  at  the  time  of  the  September meeting.There  is momentum and the  expansion is  moving  along at  a quite goodand sustainable  level.Now with  respect  to  the national  economy, I must  say that  Iwas  quite surprised at  the  extent of  tightening assumed in  theGreenbook and the  resultant  low level  of  GDP growth  for  three  or  fourquarters  in the  range  of  1 to  1.8 percent.  As  President  Boehneindicated,  I think  this  is  flirting with recession even  in  the  absenceof  shocks  to  the  economy.  There  is  very little margin for  error.  Inthe  short  term, our  forecast  does  show  the  economy  starting toeven though we have  some  deceleration, we  show stronger growth withlower unemployment and a somewhat  higher  inflation rate.  I think thatit  is  going to  take  less  tightening than envisioned in  the  Greenbookto cause  inflation  in the  current  expansion to  peak at  a level  that  iswell below the  one  that we had  in the  last  cycle.  Our  forecastassumes  that a rise  in  inflation can  be viewed as  a cyclicalphenomenon and not  necessarily the  start  of  a trend.  But  that beingsaid, our view is  a little more  optimistic  and it  may not  be  thecorrect view;  it  may be unrealistic.  The  risk,  in my judgment,  is  onthe up  side,  and we need  to  remain vigilant  to  inflation.  I thinkthat  the  cost  of  underestimating price pressures can be very high.Perhaps  I've  tipped my hand as  to what  I would want  to  do,  so I won'tgo  any further at  this point.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

MR. MCTEER.  The  economy in  the Dallas  District continues  toshow moderate to  strong growth  across  the board.  Virtually everysector  seems  to  be  expanding with the exception of  livestockproduction.  At  our board of  directors meeting  last Thursday, thereports were uniformly upbeat.  Every region within  the  Districtreported positive news.  The  only negative  reports were  scatteredslowdowns  in  single-family housing  construction, but even  thesereports noted strong gains  in  other construction  activity such  asapartment, shopping center, and industrial  construction.  OurBeigebook contacts  and numerous  other  reports  from around  the  Districtnoted a significant  boost  in both price  and wage pressures over  thelast  several weeks.  This  represents  a sea change  from previousreports,  and if  this  is  a start  of a new trend,  it  implies  seriousconsequences  for monetary policy.  More and more  industries  arereporting reaching or  approaching capacity limitations  as  well  as  anewfound ability to  pass  on  some of  their higher  input  costs  to  thenext  stage  of production  or  consumption.The national  economy, as  best  as we can  tell,  is  showing thesame  early signs  of  overheating as  the  Eleventh District.  Variousresource  constraints rather  than demand conditions  seem  to be  themajor  factor determining the  growth  of  output.  Although thestatistical measures  of price  and wage  inflation  have yet  to  show anupward trend, we  can't help but  notice  that  the  Beigebook reports  fromaround the  nation indicate  a pickup  in price and wage pressures  that11/15/94-19-national  economy,  the  Greenbook seems  to  have  the current  state  ofaffairs  about  right, but  I expect  that the  staff  forecast  may haveunderestimated the strong  forward momentum in  the economy as  we gointo  1995.  The  risks  to  the  forecast both with respect  to  growth andto  inflationary pressures  seem to  be  that we have  underestimated theunderlying strength  of  the  economy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  the economic  recovery in Californiaappears  to be  taking hold while conditions  in  the rest  of  the Districtgenerally remain strong.  Abstracting from month-to-month volatility,the California unemployment rate  has  fallen about  1 percentage pointsince  the  first  quarter of  the  year, although  it  remains  about  2percentage points  above  the national  rate.  In the  rest of  theDistrict,  state  employment growth has  outpaced the national  rate  inArizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon,  and Utah.  Contacts  in  District  statesother than  California and Hawaii generally  indicate  that regionalwages  are accelerating.  Labor markets are  regarded as  especiallytight  for  construction workers,  computer programmers, as  well  asbanking and retail  sales personnel.  Consumer prices have been  fairlyweak in California  in  large part because of  weak housing prices.  Morerecently, housing  sales  in  the  state  have picked  up noticeably, andmany of  our  contacts  expect a pickup  in housing  cost inflation.Turning  to  the  national  economy,  real  GDP growth hascontinued  to  be  surprisingly strong,  showing no  signs so  far  offalling below the potential  rate  of  growth.  As  a result,  as  alreadyhas  been mentioned, tight  labor  and product markets have becomenoticeably tighter  since  our  last meeting.  Moreover, at presentlevels  of  interest rates,  I would expect  to  see  further robusteconomic  growth and declines  in  the unemployment  rate  in the  remainderof  this  year and  in  1995.  Under these circumstances,  it has  becomeincreasingly clear  that  inflation would be  on  an upward trajectory  inthe  years ahead without a substantially tighter  stance of  policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  the Tenth District remains  strong,and  the  strength  is  spread generally across  all  our  states.  Activityis  robust  in most  of  our key industries,  although  there may be  somesigns  of  a slowdown  in  single-family housing;  that has yet  to  bedetermined.  Our  farm  income has weakened in  1994.  The current  datashow that  the number  of  payroll  jobs  in  the  District  increased byabout  3 percent  in September  over  a year earlier,  about  the  same  asthe nation.  I should note,  though, that  New Mexico had job  growth inthe neighborhood of  5 percent  and only Kansas and Wyoming added jobsat  a rate  less  than the  nation,  although not  a whole  lot  less.Manufacturing  continues  to  improve with most  of  the strength  in thedurable  goods  industry.  The District's  key automobile  assembly plantshave completed  their model  changeovers.  They have  told us  that  theyexpect  gradually restored production toward capacity levels.  Ingeneral  aviation, aircraft  production, another  of  our  key durablegoods  industries,  improved  in  the  third quarter with billings  upsignificantly  over  the  second quarter  and over  a year  ago.  Energyactivity improved just  slightly in  October,  but  farm income  is  downdue  to poor  livestock prices,  and  that  will be  offset just  slightly bythe  record harvest  that we  expect  or are  having.  As  we  have been11/15/94-20-seeing  for  the past  few months,  construction remains  robust  across  theDistrict.  But  as  I said, there are  some  signs  of  slowdown  in thehousing permits  area.  Anecdotal  reports point  to  some  shortages  inlabor, and that includes  unskilled labor  in  our area.  Upward pressureon wages appears  to  be  increasing.  Loan growth  in our Districtcontinues  to  be  strong although slightly less  than  last  summer;  it  wasextremely robust  last  summer.Turning  to  the  national  economy, my view  is  that  the  economyhas  considerable momentum.  Domestic  spending remains  strong;  exportgrowth is  trending upward.  With the  exception of  housing, it  isdifficult  to  see  any  immediate signs  of  a slowdown.  Indeed,  activityappears  to  be picking up  in  several industries,  particularlymanufacturing.  At current  interest  rates,  I would expect real  GDPgrowth  to remain above  potential  for  at  least  the  next three  quarters.As  a result,  with the  economy already at more  than  full  employment, anupturn in  inflation  seems  inevitable.  We  already are  seeinginflationary pressures, not  just at  the  early stages  of  production butat  the  final  stages  as  well.  As  Bill  McDonough said,  inflation  startsout  very slowly, and that  is  what we  are  seeing.  On  a year-over-yearbasis, virtually all  the  price  indices as well  as  the  employment costindex and average hourly earnings  have  either bottomed out  or  areshowing  increases  in  recent months.  So,  it  seems  to me  that  the  issuebefore us  now is  not whether  inflation will be picking  up, but  howmuch and over what  time horizon.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Anecdotal  reports  suggest  that  the  PhiladelphiaDistrict is  catching up  to  some  extent with the rest  of  the nation.Manufacturing  in particular  is  showing  strength and the  outlook ispositive.  Steel  and auto products are notably brisk.  Retailersgenerally report a pickup  in  sales,  especially in  apparel  andappliances,  and the mood  is  upbeat about  holiday sales.  Realtors  sayhome  sales  are  strong  in  the  Philadelphia area but uneven  in the  restof  the  District.  The  supply of  homes  is  high, however, and sellingprices have  been steady.  Commercial real  estate activity varies agreat  deal  around the  District  from weak  in south  Jersey to  strong insome parts  of  central  Pennsylvania.  There  is  a pickup  in  thePhiladelphia area,  especially in the  Pennsylvania suburbs.  Lendingactivity is  on an upswing  around most of  the  District and  lendingterms  are  easing, but  I don't  think we  ought  to be  surprised at  that;that's  typical.  Bad loans  are made  in  good times,  and there  is  abandwagon effect  that human nature  just cannot  resist despite  changesin legislation, better  supervision,  and  so  forth.  There  are  nogeneral  signs of  price pressures, although I hear more  reports  abouttightness  in  skilled  labor markets and  the  demand  for professional-type  jobs.  Some manufacturers  seem more  confident  about  selectedprice  increases  sticking, but most  still  talk about  tough  competitionholding prices down.  All  in  all,  the  District economy  is  less  of  alaggard and the  tone  is  better,  although feelings  of  insecurity arejust below  the  surface and sometimes  on  the  surface,  depending on whois  doing  the  talking.At  the  national level,  we are  seeing what we have  seenbefore.  Once  the  economy gets  going, we  tend to  underestimate  thestrength of  its  forward momentum and the  level  of  interest  ratesneeded to  achieve moderate growth with  subdued inflation.  Now11/15/94-21-fortunately, if  we  have  fallen behind the  curve, we are not  all  thatfar behind.  With timely  actions  going  forward, we  have  a good chanceof  keeping  inflationary pressures  in  check and  the  expansion on  track.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, my comments will  be very  similarto many of  the  others  you have  heard already.  With respect to  theDistrict,  last week  I attended a meeting of  leading business people  inVirginia who  advise  the governor on  revenue  estimates.  This  groupincludes  the  CEOs  of  most  of  the  state's  large  corporations--a  coupleof  major  railroads, a major  aluminum producer with worldwideoperations,  some banks,  a big shipbuilder,  and a big  trucking company.I was  really struck by the  uniformly bullish  commentary at  thatmeeting, not  only about  the  state  economy but  about regional  andnational  economic prospects  as  well.  Several  of  these  people saidexplicitly  that  they were planning major capital  outlays  in the  nearfuture based on these  expectations.  A number  of  them  said explicitlythat  they thought  the  consensus national  economic  forecast, which hadbeen summarized  for them  at  this  meeting as  calling  for GDP  growth  ofabout  2-1/2 percent  next year,  might be  too  low.  It was  a verybullish meeting.The  tone  of  our board meeting in Richmond  last Thursday wassimilar.  All of  the  directors were optimistic  about conditions  bothin their  local  areas  and in  their  respective businesses.  Consumerspending  appears  to  be  especially robust  in our region.  Retailers  areexpecting  a good Christmas.  There  is  what  I would describe  as  agradual  revival  of  commercial  construction in the  District.  The mainnegative  factor  is  still  the  reduction  in defense expenditures.  Buteven places  like  Norfolk, Virginia,  and Charleston,  South Carolina,where  there had been projections  of  a big negative  impact,  are  notseeing  that--I  guess  because of  the  strength of  the  general  economy.In  spite of  this  strong growth, we  have  seen only  scattered reports  ofactual price  increases  for  final  goods  and  services  in recent weeks  atleast.  But a number  of  our directors  at  the meeting  last week,especially  those who have  contacts  in  the manufacturing  sector,  saidthey  expected a number of  their  suppliers  to  put price  increases  inplace,  perhaps  fairly substantial  increases, at  the  end of  the year.Several  of  them said  they would expect  to pass  at  least  some of  theseincreases  along in  their  own prices.Nationally,  I thought  the  staff did a very fine  job of  sizingup  the  current  situation  in  this  month's Greenbook.  I guess  it  isfair  to  say that Mike  and his people  are  still  calling  for a  fairlysoft  landing.  I think  that's appropriate,  but  I would make threepoints.  First, I think it  is  worth noting  that  the  landing  in  thisGreenbook seems  to  me  to  be  less  soft  than  that  in the  SeptemberGreenbook, which  if  I remember  correctly was slightly  less  soft  thanthat  in August.  I think  there  is  a  lesson  for us  somewhere in  thispattern.  As  I recall,  the Greenbook  states  explicitly at  one pointthat  the  risk of  error  is  on  the  up  side  toward  the  situation where wemove back into  some  kind of  boom-bust pattern;  that's  something wehave  seen so  often  in  earlier postwar  cycles.  The  second point  Iwould make  about  the  Greenbook  is  that,  as  you know,  the  currentprojection is  predicated on a  significant further  move towardrestraint  in monetary policy  over  the next  several months.  Finally,even with this  further  tightening, the  Greenbook  is  still  calling for11/15/94-22-a 3 percent  inflation rate;  we  are not  really getting any reduction  ininflation.  So  even with  this  outcome, we  are still  going  to be  somedistance  from  full  price stability.On the  inflation  score,  I think  it  is  fair  to  say that  manybusiness people  with whom I have  contact  and probably more  financialnext year  to  about  3-1/2  percent.  I've  spoken to a number  of peoplewho  are expecting  something more.  I would  say that  this  increase ininflation  expectations  is  clearly at  least part  of  the  explanation  ofwhat  is  going on  in bond markets  and foreign exchange markets.  Thebehavior in  these markets  suggests  to me  that we  probably have  lostsome  additional  credibility over  the  last  several weeks.  I agree withBill  and Cathy and others who have  said  that  we  are  in  a position nowwhere we need to make  another decisive move  in  order  to  shore up ourcredibility and convince  the public  that we  are still  serious  aboutour  goals.In  this  regard, Mr. Chairman,  I would like  to  repeatsomething  I said at  the  September  meeting.  I think  that  inflationexpectations  currently are  especially sensitive  to  incoming short-runeconomic data  and to  indications  of monetary and other economic policychanges  precisely because we don't  really have a clear,  step-by-stepstrategy to  meet  our longer-run  goals.  I think we would be wellserved by explicit multiyear inflation  targets  that  we would announcepublicly.  If  we  took  this  approach, I think it  would relieve  some  ofthe  pressure on  us,  in a situation like  the  current  one,  to make  astrong move  to reinforce  and  shore up  our  credibility.  If we were  todo  something  like this,  we  obviously would need to  talk about  it  abit.  But  I think it  would  increase our operational  flexibility in  theshort  run,  and it  would reduce  the  risk that  at  some point we might dosome  damage  to  the  economic  expansion.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  With  regard  to  the  District  economy, there  isnot  a lot  new to  report;  it  remains  strong.  Manufacturing  is  robust.Materials  prices  are going up.  Employment  is  high  throughout theDistrict.  In  some  of  the metropolitan areas,  the reports we  aregetting are  that  everybody who wants  to  work  is  working.  What  seemsto be  restraining some  further job  growth in  those  areas  is  housingshortages;  businesses would attract  more  labor  from  the  rural  areas  inthe  region or maybe  from outside  the District, but  there  is  no housingin  some  of  these places.  Despite  that,  there  are  no  widespreadreports  of  wage  or price pressures, at  the  retail  level  at  least.What wage pressures  there  are  seem to be  concentrated mostly at  thelower end of  the pay scales.  I think that  is  because  of  thedifficulty of  retaining workers  there;  they have  so many easyopportunities  to move  out  and up.  Elsewhere  in  the  District,  theagricultural  situation  is  mixed.  It  is  a good year  for  crops,  thoughprices  are not  entirely favorable.  It  has been  tough  in  the  livestockindustry at  least  outside  the dairy  sector.  Since  they are  coming offabout  7 good years,  I'm not  sure  there are  any real problems  emergingthere.  We did hear some  reports  from our Advisory Council membersabout  interest  rates  starting to  bite in  the  housing and furniturethe  national  statistics  that  seem better.  But  however  that may be,  itis  clear  that  the paper  industry has bounced back.11/15/94With  regard  to  the national  economy, I don't have  a lot  toadd  to what  has  already been said.  When we  go  through  our  translationprocess  that  takes  the  labor market  data,  in  this  case  for  October,and  turns  them  into  a GDP  estimate  for  the  fourth quarter, we getabout  4-1/2  percent  growth  in  real  terms  at  an annual  rate.  In  somesense,  that's  neither here  nor  there,  of  course.  It's  history, but  itdoes  tell  us  something about  the  underlying momentum of  the  economy,which  I do  think  is  quite positive  and quite strong.  There  is  alwaysthe  danger  of  extrapolating  the  latest  reading.  On  the  other hand, asseveral  people have  already  commented, it  seems  to  me  our experienceover  the  years has been  that  once momentum starts  to  build  in  terms  ofreal  growth,  it  tends  to  go  on  for  quite some  time  and  it  probablytakes  more restraint  than we usually anticipate, at  least  early  in  thegame,  to  avoid  an acceleration of  inflation  or  indeed to  make progressin  reducing the  rate  of  inflation.Finally, let  me  comment  on the  suggestion  that Al  Broaddusjust  made.  I may come  out  at  a somewhat  different place  than he  did,but  I do  think  that  the  suggestion to  consider  the  implications  oflonger-run inflation targets  may be  a constructive one.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  a legislative  issue.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Well,  you certainly wouldn't want  to  do  itwithout  considerable political  support.  I agree with that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  National  economic  activity  is  much  stronger  thanearlier  forecasts  anticipated.  Employment  grew twice as  fast  as  thelabor  force  from January  to  October.  There was a  large rise  in hoursworked in both  September and October,  including an extraordinaryamount  of  overtime.  Wage pressures  are building.  Average hourlyearnings  surged  in October;  for  the  past  four  months,  this  measure  ofwages  has  risen at  a  4.4  percent annual  rate,  up  sharply  from only  1.3percent  in the  first  five  months of  1994.  Such reflections  of  tightlabor  market  conditions are  signs  of prospective  inflationarypressures.Strong  credit demands  also  reveal  the  strength  of  economicactivity and nominal  spending.  Growth  in business  loans  at  commercialbanks nationwide  and in the  Eighth  District  has  been rapid  throughoutthis  year.  Since  spring,  banks have  reduced  their  holdings  ofsecurities and have bid aggressively  for  time deposits  to  accommodateloan demand.  Nonfinancial  firms  have  also  increased issuance  ofcommercial  paper  since  September,  corroborating  the  increased demandfor  credit by businesses.  The  large  inventory accumulation in  thesecond quarter was  followed by a larger  accumulation in  the  thirdquarter.  Those  forecasters who had expected a  substantial slowing  inreal  growth  following a  large buildup  in  inventories  in  the  secondquarter seem  to  have guessed wrong.  Nevertheless,  inventory-to-salesratios  remain very low by historical  comparisons,  so  low  in  fact  thatmany  firms are  concerned about both deteriorating  vendor performanceand  the prospect  of  continued acceleration  in  sensitive materialsprices.My contacts  in the  Eighth  District  indicate  that  increases  ininventories have  largely been planned in anticipation of  strong  sales,11/15/94-24-including  retailers who  ended  the  last  Christmas  shopping season withlargely empty shelves.  Overall,  employment  in the  Eighth  Districtremains  robust  and  the  District unemployment  rate hovers  near  itslowest  levels  since August  1974.  This  September,  the  Districtunemployment  rate was  4.7  percent  compared with the  5.8  percent  ratefor  the nation  in October.  In  recent  contacts with businessexecutives  and directors  in the  Eighth  District, the  consensus  wasthat wage pressures  are building, especially  for  unskilled workers  andconstruction workers.  I have been hearing  these  reports  and havementioned  them here  for  some  time,  but  I'm hearing more  and morereports  of  actual  increases  in  wages.  Furthermore, contacts reportprice pressures  from  rising costs  of  raw materials from both domesticand  foreign sources.  Prices  of  imported goods,  which had been animportant  factor  in holding down inflation until  recently, rose at  a6.9  percent  annual  rate  in  the  past  two  quarters  after  falling overthe previous  two  quarters.Finally,  looking ahead,  I am  troubled by the  Greenbookforecast,  which  shows  that  among G-7  countries  only  Italy and theUnited  Kingdom have  a higher  inflation outlook  for  1996  than theUnited States.  Thus,  it  is  not  surprising  that we  seem  to  lackcredibility with respect  to price  stability, and  this  is  indeed costlyin current  circumstances.  Picking up  on what Al  Broaddus  said,  I feelthat  it  may be  time  for  us  to  consider setting  a  specific  inflationtarget  that  looks  out  into  the  future.  I think,  and  this  point wasmade  as well,  that  it  could make  our  job considerably easier  incircumstances  like  the present--with upward cyclical  inflationarypressures--if people  were willing  to  look  out  to  a  longer-range targetand that  added to  credibility.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman,  economic activity  on balance  inthe  Seventh  District appears  to  be a bit  stronger  than  at  the  time  ofour September meeting.  Retail  sales and manufacturing  output  havestrengthened, and overall  housing activity through  September held upbetter  than might  have been expected given  the  rise  in mortgageinterest rates.  One cautionary  note  is  that  new single-family homesales  in  the Midwest  have  been weaker than  national  trends.  Contactsin the manufacturing  sector continue  to  report  robust  activity, andseveral  are now beginning to  report  gains  from higher  levels  ofexports.  Looking ahead to  next year, a number  of  manufacturersanticipate  that  growth will  slow in  their  domestic markets,  but thisslowdown could be  offset by  continuing  increases  in  exports.  Similarto  the  Board staff,  we  estimate that  the  auto  sector will  contributeabout  1/2  percentage  point  to  real  GDP  growth  in  the  current  quarter,despite  the  fact  that  the  auto  industry  is  still  struggling  to  addressseveral  model  changeover  and parts  shortage problems.  We  also expectabout  the  same  contribution to  real  GDP  growth in  the  first quarter of1995.Indicators  of  consumer activity  in  the  District are  quiterobust.  Regional  income  growth has  been above  the  national  average.Retail  sales  have  improved, with sales  in Michigan and Wisconsin upmore  than  12  percent  in  the  third  quarter, which  is  well  above  the7-1/2  percent national  figure.  More recent  reports  from  two majorretail  chains  indicate  that  sales  in  early November were  very good  andthat  it  would not  be a surprise  if  holiday  sales  exceeded  earlier11/15/94-25-expectations.  In general,  retailers  throughout  the  District  are  quiteoptimistic  about the  holiday season and have  been adding  toinventories.  Consumer  confidence remains  high and well  above  thenational  average,  but  it  has  flattened out  in recent months  due  to  aIn  the  agricultural  sector,  harvests of  corn and  soybeanswill  set new records  in  the  District  and  the nation.  Cattle  and hogsupplies are  also  running at historically high levels.  Thesedevelopments have  led  to  lower prices  to  date,  and prices  are expectedto  remain  low throughout  1995  in those areas.  The banner  corn andsoybean  harvests have  taxed the capacity of  the  grain storage  andtransportation  facilities,  but  these  bottlenecks, which are  common  inyears  of  big  crops,  are  already  starting to ease.Examples  of  Seventh District  industries  operating at  or nearcapacity are  numerous,  including motor vehicles,  steel,  appliances,construction,  agricultural  equipment,  office  furniture, and  railroadcar loadings.  Steel  price  increases  appear  to  be in  the  6 to  8percent  range,  and  significant increases  are reported  for othercommodities  such as  chemicals and paper products.  Althoughmanufacturers  continue to  resist  supplier price  hikes,  conditions  seemgenerally more  conducive  to  such  increases.  Some manufacturers  canoffset  these  increases  with productivity improvements;  others  cannotand will  increase prices  of  their products  to  consumers.District employment  growth  has been quite good.  In almostall  of our  states,  unemployment rates  are below the national  average,including  a  5.1  percent  rate  in Michigan  after many years  ofsignificantly higher unemployment rates  in  that  state.  We  areincreasingly hearing of  labor  shortages  at  the  low and high ends  ofthe  skills'  spectrum  from retailers  having difficulty filling  entry-level  positions  to manufacturers  reporting a  futile search  forengineers  and designers.  I visited Detroit recently,  and it  is  clearthat  the  help wanted signs  are  out  in Detroit.  I learned  that  onelarge  retailer is  trying  to  attract  new employees  by putting helpwanted advertisings  in  the monthly bills  that  they send  to  theircustomers.  Despite  these  shortages,  few manufacturers  or  retailershave  reported any significant upward pressure  on wages of  permanentpositions.  However, as  I mentioned  at  the  last  meeting,  temporaryhelp  firms have reported higher wage  increases  of  about  5 percent.On balance, Mr.  Chairman, we  concur with  the Greenbookassessment that  the  economy  is  now past  the point  of  fullnoninflationary  utilization of productive  resources.

MR.  LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  With regard  to  thenational picture,  I'd  like  to  associate my comments with the  veryeloquent analysis  of  President McDonough;  he was  right  on  target.With regard  to  the  staff  forecast,  I would only add  the  issue  oftiming.  We  do not know  in what  quarter  the  economy will  slow down,but we  do know  that  it  will  slow down.  I  think  the point  aboutforecasting  increasingly hard landings  is  a good  lesson for us.  As  aside note  on hard landings,  if  anyone  really wants  to  experience  ahard  landing  I recommend Rumanian Air.  [Laughter]11/15/94-26-At  the  last meeting,  I set  aside  my normal  reservations  andfavored an  asymmetric  directive because  I perceived the  possible needfor  foreign exchange  intervention.  I specifically recommended  that,if  we had  that  intervention, it  be  accompanied at  that  time by a  50basis  point  increase in  rates.  Frankly,  I think  that  had we  done thatat  the  time,  the  move would have  been both  appropriate and, I wouldadd, sufficient.  Why did we have  the  intervention?  It  wasn't  becauseof volatility  or disorderly markets.  It  wasn't a  signal  of policychange  at  the  time.  The word that was  most  commonly used was  a"bridge."  A bridge  to what?  At  the  time,  cynics  in  the market  and afew  of  the press  reports guessed  it was  a bridge  to  the  election.  Ihope and  trust  that  that was  not  the  case,  and no one  knew what  theoutcome would be  anyway.  I think the  other option was  that  it  was  abridge  to  what we are  about  to  do  today.  If  so,  if  we  are bridging toa  50  basis point  move,  which everyone  anticipates,  then  it  would belike  building a bridge  to  the  middle  of  the river, which  is  actuallyanother  thing they do  in Rumania,  [Laughter]  but  so much for  that.The key  is  that  I think markets  will probably  think we are  all wet  ifwe  do.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That  is  what happens when you are  awakened at2:00  and  4:00  in  the morning by a one-year  old!  The  other part  of  mytrip,  I had both our bureaucracy and  the  Rumanian bureaucracy preparea serendipitous  schedule.  The  first  part  of  the week I was  in  Parisand  I was  able  to  go  on  from  there  after both  in meetings  and also  in private meetings  I had withmeetings.  I thinkand with folks  atthere was  a strong  sense  that  U.S. policy  is  behind thecurve.  I can only  second what  Peter mentioned about  the  perceptionthat  we are  behind and that  therefore  a big increase would be  coming.Of  course, diplomats  always  talk  about  it a  little  circumspectly.  Myfavorite  description was by one of  the  Europeans  that  monetary policywas  behind the  curve  in non-European OECD economies.  [Laughter]  Idon't  think they were  talking about  the  Australians and NewZealanders,  but here we are.  The bottom line  is  that  while  Icertainly do not  believe in  the  tail  wagging  the dog, and  I certainlydon't  think that  foreign exchange  concerns  should  drive  our  long-runpolicy, I do  think  that given what  the  folks  around  the  table havesaid  about  the  strength  of  the economy,  the  issue  is  not  whether  tomove but when.  Frankly, I  think our  intervention really boxed us  in acorner,  and  I don't  think  that  the  50  basis  point  option  is  stillthere.  So,  I would join  others  in  recommending  that we do  somethingmore  than that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mr.  Chairman, the  Greenbook outlook fordramatically  increased  short-term rates and a marked slowing  in therate  of  economic  growth accompanied by rising  inflation  and increasedunemployment  is  not a particularly appealing  one.  It  would be muchmore attractive  if  the  inflation projection was  one  that  reflectedgreater  progress  toward stable prices.  An  even more  unpleasant visionis  the  one  that  would emerge  if  further  significant restraint were  notput  in place.  In  spite of  recent  declines  in  consumer  confidence  as11/15/94-27-measured by the  Michigan  survey, consumer  confidence  remains  at a highlevel  and may be  further  enhanced by the  election results.  I suspectthat  the  current momentum  in  the  economy may be  significantly strongerthan previously expected and may in  fact produce  a  stronger GDPperformance  in  1995  than that  projected in  the Greenbook.  It  is  hardfor me  to  accept  the  idea that we  can't  get  an  inflation ratesignificantly below 3 percent.  If  the monetary policy inherent  in  theGreenbook  forecast can't produce a better  result,  then perhaps  weshould be considering monetary policy alternatives  that  would makebetter progress toward  stable  prices  even  at the  short-term cost  ofunemployment marginally  above  the NAIRU.  The  signal  effect  of  greaterrestraint may in fact  wring out  some  of  the  inflation  expectations inthe markets,  which  are  inherent  in  current  bond prices.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to me  the  situation  isunequivocal.  At  this  point  in  the morning,  I have very  little to  addthat's useful.  Virtually every bit of  information  that  we  have  gottenand certainly  the reports  around the  table  this morning have  indicatedthat  we have  an extremely  strong  expansion.  It  may be accelerating.I don't expect  this,  but  if  somehow nothing were done,  I think weprobably  could get  rather  quickly into  a runaway boom situation.  Theinflation  teakettle  isn't whistling yet, but  I think  the  temperatureinside  of  it  is  rising  rather markedly.  There  is  no  need to  go backover any data;  we  are  all  familiar with  them.  As  far as  I'mconcerned, the  only question before  the  house  is  in  the next part ofthe meeting.  That  is,  what  is  the best way  to  deal with  thissituation?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  The momentum  of  the  real  economycertainly seems  to  be  stronger  in  all  sectors  than was anticipatedearlier.  I think that  the  revisions we have  seen recently  in a numberof  forecasts  and,  for  example,  the recent  benchmark revision  in  theemployment  level,  demonstrate  that  there was more momentum  than weearlier  thought.  This may well  carry the  economy  forward  at  an  evenstronger pace than we had anticipated.  It  is  carrying  forward intoconsumer confidence.  All  of  the spending  indicators  are showingconsiderable  strength,  even housing.  We would have  expected more  of  adownturn  than we have  seen  in  the  interest-sensitive parts of  theeconomy.  The  outlook  in industrial production  is  for  continuedstrength.  Autos and  light  trucks  alone probably will  sustain us  for  awhile.  The  real  economy  is  showing more  strength than we hadpredicted a couple  of  meetings ago;  essentially,  the  second-halfslowdown  that was  anticipated never occurred.Turning  to  the  financial markets,  I think that  they generallyare  functioning  quite well;  the  currency markets  may be  a bit hard toread.  We  should  look  to  some  of  the  lessons  that  the  financialwe  are getting  is  coming  from 35-year  olds,  these  35-year  olds  stillare voting with dollars.  I  think  that  there  is  something to  belearned there.  The markets  are not as  volatile  as  they were earlierin the  year.  There  is  more depth.  There  are more varied expectationson market  direction and financing needs.  Some people have expresseddisappointment  in  the  stock market,  but we may well  look back on this11/15/94-28-in  coming years  as being  one  of  the  most  orderly corrections  that wehave  seen  in  quite  a while.  The  cost of  capital  has  increased,  bothfor  equity and  debt  financing.  But  it  does  not  appear  to  beinhibiting  investment  either  by households  or  in  the business sector.Banks  are now providing capital  that  earlier was  being provideddirectly by  the  stock  and the  bond markets.  It  seems  to me  that wehave  had a relatively  smooth  transition  from  credit  crunch  to  thedirect  issue market  and to  bank financing.  The  financial  marketsgenerally are  functioning quite well.  The  fact  that we haven't  had amajor  accident,  I think, is  significant.On the  inflation side,  some people  have suggested that  we  aregetting closer  to  the  point where we  should see more  increases  infinal  consumer prices.  But  in  fact,  we  have  seen  increased pressurein  the  CPI  for  the  third quarter.  We are well  above  a 3 percent  rateat  current  levels,  and  I would hope  that  our goals  would be betterthan  3 percent.  I'd associate  myself with Al  Broaddus'  comments aboutstarting to  look  at  some  kind of monitoring  range  for  inflation,particularly  one with a  long-term  outlook.  I think  that we  are notgiving as  clear signals  as  we might with respect  to  what we  thinkinflation  should be.  I guess  I'm getting a  little  tired of  seeing  allthese analysts  say that  inflation  is  under  control when  in  fact  it  isabove  3 percent.In  sum,  I think  that  some  of  the previous  uncertainties  thatwe  saw in  the  economy appear  to  have been  resolved in  favor  ofeconomic  strength.  Productivity  increases have resumed.  The marketshave been reasonably  steady.  The  elections  are over  except  for  theState of  Maryland.  We  still  do  have some  downside risks.  Healthinsurance still  is  going  to  be  an  uncertainty.  I suspect  thesolutions are  likely to  change  now, but  the problem is  still  there.The new Congress may yet  create  unimagined new challenges  for us.  Ithink we  are  going to  have  to  start  factoring  in  such  things  as  taxcuts  and perhaps  increases  in defense  spending.  What  is  this  going  tobe doing  for  the  Federal  deficit?  The monetary aggregates  remainsurprisingly weak,  so  I count  this  as  one  of  the  remaininguncertainties.  I hope  that productivity,  efficient  capacity use  oreven more  capacity will  permit  higher growth with no  inflation, but  Ithink  that's  fairly wishful  thinking.  Perhaps  the NAIRU  is  lower  thanwe  had thought,  but  again  that  may well  be  wishful  thinking.  Onbalance,  the  risk seems  to  be  for  continued economic momentum  at  leastin  the  near term.  I think we'll  see  inflation pressures increasinglyevident.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I'll  say very little  about  the  District.  In myDistrict contacts,  I raised two  questions  that  I thought were  of  someuse  in  the period since  the  last  meeting.  One was  about  labor marketconditions  and  the persistent  comment  about  shortages,  tightness,especially  for  unskilled, semi-skilled workers  and  so  on.  I askedwhat  they were  doing  about  it,  and  the  general  response  was  "hiringbonuses,"  with  the  exception  of  the  construction industry.  Thatindustry is  willing to  raise  offering wages;  others  industries  are notgoing to  let  higher wages  go  into  the  cost  structure.  I asked  themhow they  are  responding  to  current  retention requirements  and  againthe  answer was  bonuses--one-time payments  to  retain workers  that  theyare not willing  to  build  into  the  cost  structure.  In  response  to a11/15/94-29-question about  the  outlook  for passing  through cost  increases  tohigher prices,  respondents,  especially retailers  and various  consumerproducts  companies,  simply said  "impossible."  I noted in  thesupplement  to  the Greenbook that  the  Michigan survey of  consumersentiment  indicated that household appraisals  of  car and appliancebuying conditions deteriorated in  early November.  I think  that bearswatching, especially in  this post-election period.  Small  businessesthat  I asked about  their  outlook  for  the next year versus  theiroutlook  for  1994  at  this  time  last year were more optimistic  last yearthan  they are  this  year looking a year ahead.  That was  before  theelection.  I have no  idea what the  election did to  their optimism.Also,  the Michigan survey shows  the mean  and median values  of  expectedinflation  declining over  the next  five years  to  their  lowest  levelssince  1990.  So,  we may not  be  as  far behind  the  inflation psychologycurve  with real people as  financial market  indicators would suggest.On  the national  economy, as  shown in  the  Greenbook, we havehad four good quarters  averaging  4 percent  growth, and  I have noreason  to disagree with  the  staff  projection that  this  quarter alsowill  have  4 percent growth.  That  comes  after  approximately eightquarters  of  subpar performance.  We  had a rebound effect  after theGulf  war in  the  spring and  summer of  1991,  and the  economy  then  tendedto  go  flat.  The  staff  forecasts  overstated the  economy's growth afterthat  for  about  two years.  I don't view those  two years  as  having beena result  of  the  inadequacies of  aggregate demand, but  rather the  realshock effects of  a variety of  depressants  in various  sectors  andindustries  that were preventing the  economy  from performing very well.Therefore, I don't view the  last  four  or  five quarters  of  good growthas being  the  result of pump-priming stimulus  to aggregate  demand byour monetary policy or  fiscal  policy or  anything else.  Rather,  I seethem as  the  result of  the  dissipation  of  those  earlier depressants.In  that  sense,  I view this  growth in output  and employment as  havingbeen  a good thing, a make-up  for  the  earlier subpar performance.I don't view that  growth as  being a precursor to  futureinflation because  I don't view it  as  having been  fostered by  excessivemoney  creation.  The subject  of  inflation to me  is  still  the  subjectof  the purchasing power of  money.  I don't see  that the  growth ofoutput and employment  reduces  the purchasing power  of money.  I dothink it would be helpful,  as  Al  Broaddus was  suggesting,  for us  tohave  credible, multiyear objectives  and  to  seek a legislative mandatefor  achieving our  price  objectives.  In  part,  the  reason is  theproblem  that we now have  with inflation  psychology.  Here  is  where ourown words cause  us  a problem.  If  we  talk about  the  purchasing powerof  money as  having something  to  do with  the NAIRU and potential  outputor  something,  then I think  that we  have  no  choice but  to  continueraising the  funds  rate  and create  some unemployment  and some perceivedslack.  The  last  time  this  Committee went  through a tightening periodin  1988 and  1989,  it was  being guided by the  opportunity costrelationships  of  broad money and the  P* model,  which  seemed to beserving  the Committee  fairly well  including  the behavior  of  the  stockof  money--we  got  about  5 percent  M2  growth in  that period.  We  don'thave  that now.  The Committee  lost  confidence  in  staff  estimates ofthe  demand for money balances  or  the  supply of  things;  we  just  didn'tknow what  to make  of  that  and we  all  fell  into  a pattern of  thinkingthat we know a lot  more about  aggregate supply of  goods  and servicesand labor and  aggregate demand  for  labor  and output  and how toinfluence demand for  labor and output  than  I think we have  reason to11/15/94-30-know.  I don't  think that  we have  reason  to  have more  confidence  inour  ability  to  know what  is  really going on out  there  in  terms  ofproductivity, consumption, and  investment patterns  than we do  aboutmoney supply and money demand.  There  appeared  since  our  last  meetinga very good article  in Business  Week magazine  on  this problem of  thequality of  the  economic  statistics  that  we use  to  guide ourselves.There was  nothing new  in  that article  for  those of  us  in  thisbusiness,  but  I think it  was  very helpful  to  have  that  in  the publicforum saying  that  there  are  a  lot  of very serious  quality problems  inthose numbers.  We better be careful  and not  rely on  them too  much  insince  last  spring where  every time  we come  back, we  need another  50basis points  to  get  to  neutral.  Now the  staff  is  at  6-1/4  percent.  Iknow where  it  is  going  to  be  in December;  it  will be  at  6-3/4  percentand then  in February at  7-1/4  percent--just  extrapolating the  trend.At  some point we  have  to  have  a different  rule  that  says,  enough  isenough  and let's  coast  for  a while.  I'm not  soft on  inflation.  Iwant  to  go  to  price  level  stability.  But  I also  don't want  to  makethe mistake  of  continuing to  tighten  too much, precipitating adownturn  because I know what  will happen.  This  means we  will gocompletely  the  other way and  set  the  stage  for more  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Since our  last  meeting, the  evidence  hascontinued  to  accumulate  that  there  is  enough momentum  in  aggregatedemand  to carry  the  economy past potential  output.  We have yet  to  seemuch slowdown in  the  interest-sensitive  sectors,  and  it may well bethat  easier  lending terms  have offset  somewhat  the  impact  of  higherinterest  rates.  The news  on  the  international  side  of  yet  furtherupward revisions  in  foreign GDP  growth reinforces  the  view that  theeconomy will  overshoot  the  NAIRU with potentially inflationaryconsequences.  The  recent  decline  in the  dollar  exacerbates  thisconcern,  although  fortunately the  dollar  has  risen  a bit  against boththe  mark and  the  yen  since  the Greenbook was  put  to  bed.  The amountof  slack  in  the  economy, however  it  is measured, clearly hasdiminished.  I  think that  the performance of  wages  and prices  accordsquite well with the  predictions  of  a Phillips  curve model  in which  theeconomy is  currently in  the  vicinity of  the  natural  rate.  So  thereare  few surprises  there.  It  is  not  surprising  that we  are  seeing someearly warning  signs  of  rising  inflation,  including business  reportsthat  there will be  price  increases  after  the  first  of  the  year andanecdotes  about  rising wages  to  retain and attract  qualifiedemployees.  I think the  staff's  inflation  forecast  that  the CPI willrise  to  3-1/2  percent  in  the  first  half  of  1995  is  quite  reasonablebased on historic  experience.  It  is  difficult,  though,  to  construct  ascenario  in which inflation  over  the  next year would rise  by a  lotmore  than the  staff  forecast.  So,  I think  there  is  limited upsiderisk of  an  inflation  rate  increase  over  the  next year  or  so.  The  keyquestion, of  course,  is  whether  and how quickly this  modest  rise  incore  inflation may become  embedded in  inflationary expectations,feeding back  into  wage and price  formation.  I think  there  is  riskhere unless  aggregate demand is  restrained.Now, what  concerns  me most  in connection with  the  Greenbookforecast  is  that  the  assumed further  tightening of  150  basis pointsentails  considerable  downside  risk to  the  economy  that  will beconcentrated  in  1996.  In  light of  the  current  strength  in the11/15/94-31-interest-sensitive  sectors,  it  is  tempting  to  conclude  that  themonetary tightening we have had so  far  isn't producing and will  notproduce  the  slowdown we desire.  But  the  time  honored view amongeconomists  is  that monetary policy operates with  long  lags.  Iconsider this  view to  be  supported by considerable  empirical  evidence.If  so,  there  is  a real  risk  of  a hard  landing,  instead of  a softlanding,  if  we  are too  impatient  and overract.  Demand may be  strongnow because monetary conditions were  so  easy until  last spring.  Thetightening  is  really quite recent and its  impact  most  likely has  notyet  been fully  felt.  Indeed, as  President Jordan noted in hiscomments,  the November Michigan survey suggests  a sharp  deteriorationin household appraisals  of buying conditions  for houses  andsignificant declines  in  willingness  to  use  credit  and savings.  Thebetter  to  buy now than  later.This  view, namely that  there  remains restraint  in  thepipeline,  seems  consistent  to me with  the Greenbook  forecast because,given the  lags  of  monetary policy, the  Greenbook's projected slowdownin  1995  must primarily be  related to  the  interest  rate  increases  thatalready have  occurred,  along with other  factors,  and can't be  relatedprimarily to  the  assumed further  tightening of  150  basis points.  Thestaff  forecast  implicitly assumes  that we already have  enoughrestraint  to  slow growth in  1995  by enough to  bring unemployment  backto  the  natural  rate by the  end of  1995.  In  that  case,  the argumentfor  an  additional  150  basis points  of  restraint  rests  on  the  staff'sassumption  that without  that  restraint, demand would rebound  stronglyin  1996.  Now, that  view may be  correct, but  the  logic  of  why  therewould be  this  strong rebound in  demand in  1996 without  the  150  basispoints  of  additional  restraint does  not  seem compelling to  me.  Ithink  there  is  a distinct  possibility that that  much extra restraintwould represent  overkill  and that  the  overkill would make  itself  feltin  1996.  In  addition,  I would point  out  that  the Greenbook  forecastassumes  that  the  tightening  is  going  to  have  relatively littleadditional  effect  on  long-term rates.  While I'm  not a good  forecasterof  movements  in  long-term rates,  certainly  that  assumption has provenincorrect  thus  far.  I conclude  that  the  degree of  tightening assumedin the  Greenbook poses  a serious risk of  a hard  landing in  1996,although in  the  absence of  some  further  tightening,  I think therewould be an unacceptable  risk that  inflation would accelerate.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Until  about  three minutes  ago  I thought  that,even  though I was  speaking  last,  I would have  some things  to  say thathad not  been said before.  But  that is  less  true now than  it  was a fewminutes  ago.  Let me  start  at  the point  where Janet  Yellen  left  off.I thought it  was  a remarkable  feature  of  the  Greenbook projectionsthat  we could put  in another  150  basis points of  tightening  at  theshort  end and get  almost nothing--10  basis points  or  something  likethat--at  the  long end.  Now, that  is  not  impossible;  nobody can rulethat  out.  But given  the history of  1994,  I think  it  takes  a certainamount of  guts  to project  that.  I commend  the  staff  for  having thatmuch guts;  it  is  more  than  I have.  I'm not as  worried about  the35-year  old bond  traders  that Bill  is worried about  as  I am about  the25-year  old bond  traders who will  be  on  it  very quickly.  Furthermore,if  in  fact  long rates  don't move  at  all,  we won't  get a lot  of11/15/94-32-tightening out of  this additional  150  basis points.  I don't  doubtthat  GDP,  sales,  etc.,  are growing briskly and that the  level  ofresource utilization,  including  labor utilization,  is pretty near  andthat growth  in the  second half  of  1994 now looks  higher  than wethought  in August  and certainly  higher than we  thought  in  July.  SoI'm persuaded  that  there  is  a strong  likelihood of  a small  overshoot--we may indeed already have  had a small  overshoot--and that  probablysome more monetary tightening is  indicated.  Nevertheless,  as  we whipourselves  up  into  a frenzy here,  I think we  should remember a fewthings.  The  first  is  that  the  staff's  4.1 percent  forecast  for  thecurrent  quarter  is  well  above  the  consensus,  as  Mike mentioned.  Nowit  is  true,  as  Mike  also mentioned,  that  the  early indications  forthis quarter  are quite  strong, but  let's  also  remember  that,  as we  sithere now, we  know very little  about October  and nothing at  all  aboutYellen mentioned, a few,  small  contra-indications--no  indication  thatthe  economy  is  about  to  slump,  absolutely not--but a few contra-indications.Much more  important  than  the next  quarter is  the  longer-termoutlook, and  that  is  what I really want  to  focus  on.  I am thinkingabout,  roughly speaking,  the broad picture  of  the  economy and monetarypolicy over a four-year period  comprised  of  the  last two  years  and  thenext  two  years.  As  Janet mentioned a few minutes ago--and as  EdBoehne  and Bob  Forrestal mentioned earlier--there  is  a sharp  tail-offin  the Greenbook forecast  between now and  the  second or  third quartersof  1995.  The real  GDP growth numbers  starting with the  currentquarter are:  4.1,  2.5,  1.4,  and  1.0  percent.  Given the  lags,  thatdoes not  have anything to  do with any subsequent  tightenings  from  hereforward.  Therefore,  it  can come  from  only three places.  It  could befactors  having nothing  to  do with monetary policy, and that'spossible.  But  I think we have  all  agreed  that  there  is  considerableforward momentum in this  economy and,  if  anything is  slowing  it  down,it  is  monetary policy.  I think  that's a very strong consensus  aroundthis  table;  and  I share it.  The  second candidate  is,  of  course, the175  basis point  increase  that we have  already put  into the  system andthe  huge run-up  in  long-term rates  that  has  come  along with  that.Thirdly, something  that has barely been mentioned up  to  now, though Iguess Janet  Yellen  touched on  it,  is  the  wearing  off  of  the monetaryease  that  the FOMC  put  into  the  system  ending in  September  1992.  Itwas  a very substantial dose  of  monetary ease.  That  factor  isvirtually  ignored in  all public  discussions  and  in most  of  thediscussions  inside  the FOMC  to  date.  But everything we  know about  theeffects  of monetary policy  says  that monetary ease put  into  the  systemin  strong doses  in  1991  and 1992  should have  its maximum effects onreal  GDP growth  in  1993  and  1994--and now come  the  important  words--and  then wither  away.  You  do not permanently raise  the  level  of  GDPby putting  the  economy on a monetary high.  We push  it  up  a hill  andthen it  comes  down  of  its  own accord.  I don't  think  there  is  muchdispute  about  that.Now, there  is  a lot of  dispute  about  the numbers.  I had thestaff  run  its  econometric model  of  the  economy, the MPS  model,  to  tryto  quantify that.  Nobody has  to believe  these numbers,  but  I don'tknow where else  to  get  numbers  other  than  trying  to put  this policythrough  an econometric  model.  According to  our  staff model,  theimpact  of  all  the  changes in monetary policy from mid-1990  to  date,11/15/94-33-including the  easings  from mid-1990  to  September  1992,  the  subsequentperiod when  short-term interest  rates  were held constant,  and then  thetightening  this  year up  to  now should have  done  the  following to  GDP:added about  .7 percentage point  to  the  1992  growth rate;  about  1-1/4percentage points  to  the  1993  growth rate;  almost  1-1/2  percentagepoints  to  the  1994  growth rate;  about  3/4 percentage point  to  the  1995growth rate  coming down  the hill;  and  0--coincidentally  it  happens  tobe  0--to  the  1996  growth rate.  What  I want  to  focus  your  attention onis  the estimate  of  the  swing  in  the monetary impulse  on the  growth  ofdemand  from  1994  to  1996  of  about  1-1/2  percentage points.The  same model  says  that,  if  we  follow the  Greenbook'srecommended  increase  in  the next  few months  of  another 150  basispoints  in the  funds  rate--and by the  way, if  long rates  respond asthey historically do  and not  by next  to nothing--then we will  chip  atiny bit off  the  1995  growth rate--a very, very small  amount--andabout  a percentage point  off  the  1996  growth rate.  If  we  add  thosetwo  together,  we are  talking about  a swing  from monetary policy fromboth  the end of  the  expansionary stimulus  and the  move to  contractionof  about  2-1/2  percentage points,  from about plus 1-1/2  percent  in1994  to  about minus  1 percent  in  1996.  That's  a big number.  I thinkthat  with all  the  focus  on  the upside risks, which are  certainlygreater  right now--I  don't by any means  see  imminent risks  that  thiseconomy is  about to  head downhill--we  should remember  that we are  inthis  business  for  longer  than a quarter  and longer  than a year.  Andas we go  out  a couple  of  years  into  the  future,  there  is  a substantialdownside risk.  At  some point,  all  these higher  interest  rates  aregoing  to  hurt autos  more,  I think,  than  is  indicated  in  the  staffforecast.  They  are going  to  hurt  housing;  that might be  right  aroundthe  corner.  Who  knows?  I believe  they are  going  to  put a damper  onbusiness  fixed  investment, which is  growing  strongly throughout  thisGreenbook  forecast.One  last  comment  about  stopping momentum:  There  is  forwardmomentum in this  economy.  It  is  not going  to  be  stopped by putting arock  in the  road.  I don't dispute  that  at  all.  I just  want  to  closeby putting  some perspective  on what  a 325  basis point  increase  in  fedfunds  within  a year means--that's  175  to date  and,  if we  do  another150  by February, that  will  make  325  basis points  in a year.  Only oncesince  1984  has  the  Federal  Reserve  tightened by  this much within  ayear.  That period, which has  been discussed  around this  table  acouple of  times,  was between March 1988  and February  1989 while  theeconomy was  in  the midst  of  quite a large  overshoot  of  capacity.  Ifyou  look at  the  previous 30  years,  and  leave  out  the very  excitingepisodes between 1979  and  1982  when  325  basis points in  the  funds  ratewas  hardly worth talking about--there were many moves of  325  basispoints  in that  period--there  are  only two  other  episodes  in  theprevious  30  years  from 1954  to  1984.  One was  in  1969 and  the  otherwas  in  1972-73,  both with  inflation  rising considerably.  As  a result,the  real  federal  funds  rate rose  considerably  less  than 325  basispoints.  But  here we  are  talking about  the vast  majority of  theprojected 325  basis points being  on  the  real rate.  The  moral  of  thestory to me  is  that  a 325  basis point  swing, which is  beingcontemplated here,  is  not  trivial;  it  is  very strong medicine.  It  isenough to  stop  an economy with considerable momentum, although  thereis  also  an amount  of  momentum that  even  325 basis  points would beinsufficient  to  stop.  It  is  therefore not  to  be prescribed lightly.11/15/94-34-

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr.  Chairman, as  I think Governor  Lindsey alreadyremarked, the  decision facing  the  Committee  at  this  meeting would seemto  be not whether to  raise  interest  rates  but by how much.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me  tell  you this.  I thought  thatthe  two  great remarks  made previously were:  One, Governor Lindsey'shalf  bridge;  and, two,  Governor Kelley's  teakettle.  They have broughtthe  theoretical  structure  of  monetary policy  forward  immensely.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  teakettle  is  probably a better metaphor  thanthe automobile metaphor we  so  often  use--steering back and  forth andtapping  on  the  brakes.  (Statement--See Appendix.)

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions  for  Don?  If not,  let me  getstarted.  I must  say  the discussion  this  morning has been  one  of  thebest  discussions  I have heard around  this  table  in quite  a  long while.I certainly don't have much to  add to  it.  Let me  just  say, however,that  inventories in my view are going  to be  the  crucial  area  that willdetermine  to  a large  extent  how much momentum this  economy has  in it.It  is  not  that  inventories  per  se  will engender  the  total  grossnational product,  but  as  you recall  when inventory  investment  is  high,gross  domestic  product  is  high,  disposable  income  is  high,  consumptionexpenditures  are high, and we  get  a very significant  multiplier  fromthat phenomenon.We  can't  look  at  inventories  independently of  final  sales northe  reverse because  they are clearly interrelated.  We don't  have datamuch beyond August  and part  of  September,  but  there  is  a good  deal  ofindication  that  inventory investment  has not  slowed in  any appreciablemanner  in  the  fourth quarter.  I must  say  to  you, I would not besurprised  to  find  that  fourth-quarter  inventory  investment  turns  outto  be higher  than  it  was  in the  third quarter.  First,  we have a veryrobust  rate  of  increase  in  commercial  loans.  Commercial  loans,  withor without  commercial  paper and with or without  the  merger  adjustmentsthat we make,  have been a reasonably good  indicator  of  book valueinventory  changes.  If  one  looks  at  those data  through  the  last weekfor which  information  is  available,  there  is  no evidence  of  anyslowdown.  If we postulate, which I  think  the  data will  support,  thatinventory investment  in  September was  significant  when  the  industrialproduction  index was unchanged  from  the August  level,  it  seems  quitenoncredible that  the  increase  in  industrial production  of  .7 percentthat we published today  for  the month  of October did  not  create anacceleration in  inventory investment  in  October.  This  is  consistentwith the  data on  loans  and, I must  say,  it  is  consistent with theindications  that  vendor performance  continues  to deteriorate.This  is  important because  inventory  levels,  as  has beenindicated, are  still  quite  low by any  objective measure.  This  isespecially  the  case  if  we use what  I  think is  more  important  inbusiness-cycle  forecasting analysis,  namely,  inventories  at  factoryvalue  as  distinct  from  including the  trade  markups  that we get  inthese data.  Inventory  factory value  as  a  ratio  to  consumption,  for11/15/94-35-example,  is  still  low, and  indeed  it  has  not shown  the  level  of  uptickthat  we  have  seen  in  the data where  there has  been  a disproportionateamount  of  retail inventory accumulation with a very  large  trade markupelement  in  it.This  says  in  effect  that  even  though accumulation  is  quitelarge  at  this  moment,  that  is,  production  levels are  quite  a bit  aboveconsumption  levels,  we are going  to  need quite a  long period  of  thattype  of  accumulation before  the  economy  slides off.  While  it  is  quiteplausible  that  inventory  investment may begin  to  slow over  the nextmonth  or  two,  I find  that  quite unlikely.  It  is  more  likely that  thisinvestment will  proceed for  a while with  some momentum.  That  is  oneof  the  reasons why  the notion  in  the  Greenbook  that  the  upside risksare  larger than the  downside risks  in  the  forecast  strikes me asplausible.  That  is  not  to  say, however,  that  what we  are  looking atis  a  runaway boom.  The reason  is  that  when  inventory  investmentbuilds  up  rapidly,  even  though  the  levels  of  inventories  may be  low,it  is  difficult  to  sustain very large  inventory investments  thatresult  in  significant  increases  in  inventory/sales  ratios  orinventory/consumption ratios.  At  some  point  after we have gonethrough this  inventory surge  that  I think may be  in front  of  us--itahead--we are  going  to  see  that  buildup slide  off  and the  economy'sgrowth  slow down quite  appreciably.  That's  what the  history  is.  Ithink that  the  expectation that we will  get  very strong  final  demandrests  in  large part  on  how we view this  pattern as  unfolding.Clearly, producers'  durable  investment  is  moving  strongly.As Governor Lindsey pointed out,  it  does  depend on  what  the profitnumbers  look  like.  To date,  there  is  no  evidence  that  profits aredeteriorating.  Indeed,  we are  still  in  a mode where Wall  Streetanalysts  are  underpredicting  the profits  that are  coming out.  So,while  I do  think we  are  likely  to  get  some  slide  in profit  margins,right now those margins  show no  signs  of  declining.  History  tells usthat when we are  in  this  type  of  inventory environment with profitstill  an appreciable way off.  That  is,  we  are  still  an  appreciabledistance  away from  any  actual decline  in  the  economy  short of  oneinduced by a  financial  problem, in  other words  short  of  a crack in  thefinancial  system which  I'll  get  to  shortly.  History  tells us  that  theeconomy just  continues  to  move until  it  wears  itself  out.As  a consequence,  the  general  discussion  around here,  whichis  somewhat skeptical  of  the  economy's  slowing down very dramatically,strikes  a  familiar chord with me.  I'm not  sure, however,  that  I woulddismiss  the  comments made by Governors Yellen and Blinder with respectto the  pattern  of  monetary  impetus  because  there  is  no  doubt  that  thatis  a very relevant consideration.  You can very readily, as  PresidentJordan points  out,  get  yourself  into  a notion where all  you have  to  dois  keep  jacking  rates  up  and  finally you get  it  right.  The  trouble  isthat  the process  of  getting  it  right  historically has  led  finally  toour  knocking the  economy off  its  perch.I don't  think  that policymaking right now is  very difficult.I think  it  is  going to  become exceptionally  difficult when theexpansion  starts  to  slow, unit  costs  no  longer get  distributed overrapidly rising output,  and price pressures  begin  to  emerge  as  GovernorKelley's  teakettle  starts  to  whistle.  We  will  be  looking at  a11/15/94-36-situation  in which  the  growth rate  of  the  economy  is  slowing down,while  inflation  is  picking up.  This  is  in  the  context,  as  PresidentForrestal  raised  it,  of a  cyclical  rise  at  the  end  of  a cycle, whichis  really the  quite  relevant consideration.  We  are going  to be  in  aposition where we  are going  to  see  the  economy  slowing  and the  actualinflation data picking up.  And we  are going  to have  to  be able atthat  point to  recognize  that  that's  the  tail  end and continuing  toratchet  rates  up would be  a mistake.  But we  are nowhere near  thatpoint  as  far  as  I can see  at  this  particular  stage.I think  that we  are behind  the  curve,  and  that  it  would beplausible, as  I infer  from what  is  going on  around here,  to move  ratesup more  than  50  basis points  because markets  have built  in  somethingclose  to  60.  I think that  creating  a mild surprise would be  ofsignificant  value;  creating  a very  strong  surprise on  the  up sidewould be  more risky because  the  stock  market,  in my  judgment,  is  stilla  little  rich although off  its  price/earnings ratios  of  a while back.I would  not want  to  argue  that  we couldn't break  it  down  very easily.However, what bothers  me  about  doing  only 50  basis points  is  that  eventhough  the markets  are saying  that  that  is  what we probably are  goingto  do,  I think we have to  distinguish between what  they areforecasting we  are going  to do  based on our  past behavior and  whatthey think we  ought  to do.  I suspect  that while  the  majority  think weare going  to  do  50,  the vast majority will  think  that  that  is  notenough and  they will  immediately price an  additional  50  or more basispoints  in the  December  forward contracts.  In my judgment, we  would berisking--a  low probability risk but  a potentially very  large  outcomeif  it  were  to happen--a  run on  the  dollar,  a run on  the bond market,and a  significant  decline  in  stock prices.  This  would be on  top of  a$750  billion paper  loss  as  a consequence  of  the  declines  in bond andstock prices  earlier  this  year.  We would  find out what  a wealtheffect  can do  to  economic  activity in  a way  that  would make us  reallyquite uncomfortable.  So,  I think  that we have  to  be very careful  atthis  stage  and be certain  that we  are  ahead of  general  expectations.I think we  can do  that  with  75  basis  points.I don't  know what  that will  imply about what we do  inbasis points.  I'm not  sure  I can  say  at  this  moment  that  I fully buyinto  the  Greenbook's projection  of where  the  funds  rate  should be.That will  depend  on how the  markets behave.  I would argue  that  atthis  point  we  should give  serious  thought  to  75  basis  points.  If  wedo  that,  I think we can  go  to a  symmetric  directive.  If  we  choose  todo  50,  I would argue that  we should at  least  retain an  asymmetricdirective, but  I must  tell  you  that  50  makes me  a little  nervous.  No,I take  that  back:  it makes  me very nervous  and  I would be disinclinedto  go  in  that  direction.

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman, you haven't mentioned  thediscount  rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  As  I judge  the  Board's  general  view, arecommendation  to  increase  the  discount  rate  by 75  basis  points  wouldbe approved.  Implicit  in  that would be  a recommendation  that  the  full75  basis points  gets  passed into  the  funds  rate.  The  Board will bediscussing  the  discount rate  after  this  meeting.  President McTeer.11/15/94-37-

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mr. Chairman,  in  my opinion  strong action  iswarranted today, but  I don't  think we should prejudge  future actions.I, for  one, particularly don't  want  to  commit  today  to  a series  ofincreases  that  add up  to  150  basis points  and that  will  result  in  ahard landing  as  depicted in  the Greenbook.  So,  I would support  yourrecommendation for  75  basis points.  I also  believe  that  part of  thejustification  for  such an  increase has  to  do with  the weakness  of  thedollar  in the  foreign  exchange markets,  and  I think  it  would behelpful  if  that  is  cited as  one  of  the  reasons  for  the  action  today.As we  go  forward from  today, I would bear some  cautions  inmind.  One  is  that  we  shouldn't  forget  the  lag.  When we startedtightening in February we  were doing  it  for anticipated  inflationreasons,  not  for  current  reasons  and  that  still applies  today.  Wecan't  fight  today's  inflation with today's  policy.  Another point  tokeep  in mind is  that policy  already has  tightened considerably morethan  the  1-3/4 point  increase  in  the  fed  funds  rate,  both in  terms  oflong-term  interest  rates  and particularly  in terms  of  the  sharpslowdown  in all  the monetary aggregates  so  far this  year;  even  theaggregates  adjusted  for  stock fund  increases  have  slowed considerably.I just  think we should  keep  that  in mind.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I agree with your analysis  andyour  recommendation.  I also  agree  with the  points  that  GovernorsYellen and Blinder made earlier.  I hope  that we won't  go  150  basispoints,  because  I think your analysis was  on  the money.  The questionI have to  ask myself  is  how best  to  avoid that.  I think the  best wayis  by going  75  today.  Frankly, I think if  we  go  50  today, we  aregoing  to be  locked  into  doing  50  in December.  I agree we can'tprejudge  the  next meeting, but  I support  75  today  in the  hope--and Imust  say the  expectation--that  December will  be  0.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I'm in  full  agreement with your  recommendation,Mr.  Chairman.  My comments  earlier were  fairly strong  and I'd  like  toput  them  in  context.  First,  I agree with the  comments  that  bothGovernors Yellen and Blinder made  that monetary policy  lags  being whatthey  are,  we  won't  see  the  full  effects  of  what we have  done  alreadyand certainly what  we may do  today until  1995  and early  1996.However,  I do believe  that  the  labor markets  and other data we  havegotten today continue  to  indicate  that we have  overshot.  I fear,along with  Governor Lindsey,  that  if  we move  too slowly, underlyinggrowth rates, which we have  consistently underestimated all  year, willcause  significant overshooting.  In  that  case,  we might  find  itnecessary to pull  even  harder  on  the monetary  reins,  perhaps  in  theaggregate  moving the  full  150  basis points  or more,  and create a  realhard  landing.  Thus,  I believe we  should move now, move more  stronglythan  the  50  basis points  everyone  expects,  go  to  the  75  you haverecommended, and I wouldn't care  to predict  anything  about  December.I'm hopeful  that we  will  be  able  to  rein  in  the  strong economy andachieve a better  and softer  landing.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.11/15/94-38-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, since  our  last  meeting,  the  economycertainly has  shown  considerable momentum  and  labor and productstrongly,  it  seems  likely  that  the  economy will  substantiallyovershoot  its potential  and  that  inflation will  take  on  a risingtrend.  It  seems  clear  that  interest  rates  need to  be raisedconsiderably above  current  levels,  and  therefore  I support  yourrecommendation of  a 75  basis point  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate.Moreover,  I would not  be  surprised  if  a  further  tightening  in policyis  necessary in December.  Therefore, my preference would be  forasymmetric  language  toward  tightening  in  the  directive.  I would notwant  the press  release  to  imply that  there would be  a pause  in  furtheraction.  While  I am at  it,  since  I am making suggestions,  I would  findany mention  of  the  dollar as  a rationale  for  the  change  a mistake.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I must  say  I personally agree with bothof  those  recommendations.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I came  into  the  meeting, Mr.  Chairman, with  aslight  preference  for  a 50  basis point  rise,  but having  heard thediscussion around  the  table  and your  analysis,  I am  strongly insupport  of  the  75  basis points.  As  I  said earlier,  I think  that  the150  basis point  increase  suggested  in  the Greenbook is  too much.  Ihope  we  can keep  an open mind on  that  issue.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree with  your recommendationcompletely.  I am convinced that  the  sooner we move  on  this,  the  lesswe will have  to move  later.  I am not  at  all  inclined  to  say that  wehave to  look  to  a  150  basis point  increase at  any  time.  Right  now the75  is  before us;  I think that  it  is  a wise  move.  I also  think weshould make  as  little comment  about  this  as possible,  in  line withwhat Bob  Parry is  saying  in terms  of  the dollar  or whether we  shouldpause.  I think  it  would handicap us  needlessly.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I support  your  recommendation also,  Alan, basedon what  I have heard about  emerging inflationary pressures and alsothe  importance  of  credibility and  the  fact  that  if  we havecredibility,  it will  reduce  the  long-term cost  of  keeping  inflationand  inflation  expectations under  control.Just  a couple  of  comments  on  things  that  came up after  myearlier  comments.  One  is  on  the  slow money growth.  That's  something11/15/94-39-that  would ordinarily  trouble me.  I think I mentioned  last  time  orthe meeting before  that  in  view of  the very  large monetary  stimulusfrom  1991  through  1993,  I am not as  concerned  as  I would otherwise be.It  is  very difficult  to  evaluate when  the effects  of  that  stimuluswill  all  be played out.  I applaud Alan Blinder  for  trying  to putnumbers  on it.  I think we  all  know that  if  it  were that  easy to  putnumbers  on  the effects  of  monetary policy actions,  we probably  couldbe  much more  precise in  setting policy.  But  it  still  is  helpful  in  adirectional sense to  try  to  understand those  things.With respect  to  stop/go monetary policies and  the  risk ofputting things  over  the  edge  here, unfortunately we don't have,  in myview, a  lot  of  inflation credibility.  The time  to  correct  thisstop/go phenomenon  and try  to  look  through  current  developments  iswhen we  are  in  a  "go" phase.  In  other words,  I think it  is  mucheasier  to  correct  by not  driving  the  funds  rate  too  low  or  stimulatingthe  aggregates  too much when  trying to  foster  a recovery.  If  we tryto  fix  it  at  this  stage,  because of  presumptions  about  aninflationary bias  of  Fed actions,  it  really becomes very difficult  todo  that  and maintain  credibility.  I agree with what you  said before.At  some point,  we are going  to  reach a very difficult  juncture,  and wewill  have  to  make some  tough  judgments.  But  I think we  are  far  fromthat  point  right  now.

MR.  BOEHNE.  Earlier  in  the year when we knew that  we had tobegin to  tighten,  I think  there was a  case  on real  sector grounds  thatwe probably should have moved by more  than we did.  I think you  arguedrather persuasively, Mr. Chairman,  that  we  had a bubble  in  financialcould  take  a big hit.  In hindsight,  I  think that  was wise.  We mayhave  a similar bubble  now  in  the nonfinancial  sector  of  the economy.Sentiment  and  the  outlook  for the  economy have  improved.  Inventories,as  you  have noted, are  a positive influence  on  the  economy.  However,while  we  talked a  lot  today about  financial  markets  and the  foreignexchange markets,  we talked  very little about  sentiment  in  thenonfinancial part  of  the  economy.  We  run a  risk with the  75  basispoints  of  making a pretty big hole  in  that  nonfinancial bubble  outthere.  It  is  going  to  hit  those  in  the  nonfinancial part  of  theeconomy with a big  bang;  they are  going  to be  quite  surprised;  theyare  going to  think that  either we  know something  that  they don't  knowor  that  this move  is  going  to  bring about a  significantly slower  1995.My own preference would be  to go  1/2.  If  we  had  to  go another  1/2  inabout deflating  the  financial  bubble earlier  in  the year, we  have  tobe  careful  about  deflating  the nonfinancial bubble at  this  point.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I don't  know whether or not  150  basis pointsis  ultimately needed.  It  seems  to  me  that  that  is  fairly large,particularly in  view of  the monetary aggregates.  I wouldn't want  toprejudge.  I do  support  75  basis points,  symmetric.  It  strikes methat  50  is  not  enough.  I think the markets would be  immediatelylooking  for  the  next move,  and we would be  in  that  treadmillsituation.  A move  of  100  basis points  would be  too  much of  a jolt.  Ido  think we have  to  be  alert  to  the question  that  has  been raised11/15/94-40-about  how much  tightening  is  left  in  the pipeline  and  alert  to  thepotential  effects  of  the  tightening  in  the pipeline.  But we also  haveto  be  alert  to  the possibility  that  if  momentum  is  greater than  wethought,  that  pipeline may be  getting flooded  out.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman,  I support yourrecommendation with  considerable enthusiasm.  The New York Bank  hashad a  recommendation in  since November  3 for  a  75  basis  point  increasein  the discount rate.  I am very pleased with that  piece of  it.  Ithink  50  would be  too  little  and 100,  for  the  reasons  that  Ed Boehnesuggested, would be  dangerous  on  the  high  side.  I believe  that  thesymmetry  is  as  important  a part  of  your recommendation as  the  number.in  the lining  of  my  stomach and therefore  was very helpful.  But  I dothink deciding what we do  in December  at  that  time  rather  thanprejudging  it  in  any way now  is  very appropriate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I can  support  75  and  symmetry at  this meeting.Regarding outside  expectations of  what we  are going to  be doing,though,  it  looks  to me  like  we are  in  a  trap.  Former Governor Angellwas  in Cleveland a couple  of weeks  ago giving a  speech,  and he  said wewill  be at  7.75  percent on  the  funds  rate  a year  from now.  We havethis world of  traders  and  Fed watchers, whether  they are  25  or  35,that seem  to  be persuaded  like  many people that  growth  reduces  thepurchasing power of  money.  As  long as  that  is  the  perception, anyoutput  growth above  around  2-1/2  percent or unemployment  rate  belowsomething  like the  NAIRU  is  going to  have  these  people  calling foranother  50,  another  100,  basis point  increase.  At  some  point we haveto  ignore  them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  As  I  interpret  them,  I think  thecomments  around  this  table support  that.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I have  had in mind an  intermediatetarget,  if  not  a  final  target,  of  about  100  basis points.  Thequestion was when  and how to  get  there.  I have been holding out  hopethat  perhaps we would not have  to  go  too much  further  than  that.  Mypreference  would have been  to  do  this  in  stately  50  basis  point  steps.I think  that's  the  more elegant  way to  proceed.  But  I am  afraid thatthat  has  been taken  off  the  table.  Your  analysis  for  the  75  ispersuasive,  and  I would no  longer be  that  comfortable with  50.  I alsowould  favor  symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  As  I mentioned, it  seems  clear  to  me  that  sometightening  of policy is  needed  to  prevent  inflation  from accelerating,but  I have  strong doubts  about  the  need  for  an  additional  150  basis11/15/94-41-points.  My guess  is  that  it  will  take  75  to  get  the  job  done, and  Ican  live  with 75  basis  points  today.  But  on balance,  I guess  I wouldagree with Ed  Boehne,  and I would  favor  50  today.  I share  hisconcerns.  As  Don mentioned,  it  worries me  that  in  the  absence  of  anannouncement  of  the  type  we  issued in  August,  75  can backfire.Instead  of  simply  flattening  the  yield curve  and  our seeing  verylittle  effect  on  long-term rates,  a rise  of  this  magnitude may raiseso  concerned about  it--and market  expectations  about  the  ultimateexpected tightening  that we  intend here.  I am concerned about  thepossibility that  bond yields  could rise more  than  the Greenbookforecast,  which  could provoke  a  stock market  reaction.  My  ownpreference would be  for  50  today, but  I can live  with  75  as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I also  support  your recommendation for  75  basispoints  on  tactical  grounds  because  it  seems  to me  that  the  marketshave been discomfited by our  failure  to  respond recently.  I don'tthink  that  that  has  done  our credibility any good.  I would reiterate,though,  a couple of  the dangers  that  other people  have mentioned.  Atsome point,  there  is  a danger  of  overkill.  I don't  know whether  150basis  points  in  total  is  going  to  turn  out  to  be  too much  or toolittle.  On  fundamentals,  I think there  might be  something to  be  saidfor  buying a little  time  to  see when  the presumably  lagged  effects  ofprevious  tightenings start  to  bite, or  if  they do.  But  because  of  thestate of  the markets  and market  expectations,  my view is,  as  I stated,that  75  is  fine  for now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I support  the  recommendation.Quite  frankly,  I came  into  the  meeting thinking that  a  series of  50basis point  increases  would be preferable  for the  reasons  that  MikeKelley enunciated.  I also  felt  that,  coming  from a businessbackground, it  is  preferable  for people  in  business  to  see us movingin a progression  that  gives  a certain  logic  to  the  direction we  aremoving.  I think this  facilitates  longer-term planning  in business  andmakes  it  easier  to  operate  in  that  type  of  environment.  But  I waspersuaded by  the discussion here today.  I thought  that  GovernorBlinder's  and Governor  Yellen's comments  and  their  cautions were  veryhelpful,  and  I think we  should  keep  these  in  mind in the  future.  I dothink that  the mild  surprise  that  was mentioned, at  least  in  terms  ofthe  financial markets,  will be  useful  now in  sending a positivesignal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think all  of  us  have  experienced  thefollowing:  You go  into  a hotel  room  and the  room is  too  cold.  Youturn  the  thermostat up  a notch.  You  go  in  the shower.  When you  comeout,  it  is  still  a  little  too  cold.  You  turn  the  thermostat upanother notch.  You  then  go  to  sleep, but wake  up  at 2:30  in  themorning  in a sweat  in  your  bed.  The  classic mistake  of  monetarypolicy--and I am not talking  only about  the United  States and  I am noteven talking  only  about  the postwar period--is  overdoing  it.Overdoing it  in  either direction.  The classic  reason  for  this  error,though not  the  only reason,  is  impatience  in waiting  for  the  lagged11/15/94-42-effects  of  what  already has  been done.  It  is  very, very  frustratingto wait  just  as  it  is  difficult  to  keep our  fingers  off  thatthermostat when we  are  still  cold.Furthermore, one  thing we  know about  the  hazards  of  fine-tuning  is  that  we really can't  do  fine-tuning.  That  means  that whenwe  are  close  to  target  we  should be very wary of  oversteering.  Ithink  that with 3 percent  inflation and  the  economy right  about  atcapacity we are  in  an  awfully good position, and  so  we  should beextremely wary about  oversteering.  I fear  that  doing  75  today ratherthan  50  may  send us  down an  oversteering path.  I want  to  be  clear--itis  not  that  I think a  total  of  75  more  is  going  to  clobber the  economyinto  the  ground.  But  it  provides  the  setting and the  jumping offpoint  for  where we go  from here.On  strict macroeconomics  grounds,  a difference  of  25  basispoints  today--between doing  50  and  75--is  no  big deal.  You can barelydetect  it.  The  issue  to me  is  the  signal we  send--the  signal  we  sendto  the  markets,  the  signal we  send  to  people running businesses, whoare  thinking about  their sales  and  therefore  their  inventories  for  thenear-term future,  and the  signal we  send  to  consumers  about  theirexpected near-term incomes.  And this,  as you know Mr.  Chairman, iswhere  I differ  from your assessment.I think  the  signal we  send out by doing  75  today, although  Ican  see  that  we are  going to  do  75  today, is  that  the  Federal Reserveis  more  scared  about  inflation  than  the  people  out  there  thought  wewere yesterday, and  that  the  Federal  Reserve  signs  on  to  the WallStreet  indictment  that  we are behind  the  curve.  That will  be correctbecause  the  FOMC  does  sign  on to  that view.  Thirdly, we will  signalthat  there  is  much more to  come.  I do not  believe the  marketexpectation after  tomorrow will be  only 75  more.  I don't  believe  thatfor  a minute.  I believe Wayne  Angell's  7.75  percent  federal  fundsrate will  be  raised, not  lowered, as  a  result  of  what we  do  today.Finally, I think  it  sends  a  signal  that  I find very unfortunate:  thatwe  can be  led around by the  markets.  I don't want  to  send any  ofthose signals.  I'd rather  follow the  Kelley strategy.  A  confident,patient--stately did you say, Mike?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Elegant.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Elegant,  that  is,  moving with thought  andplanning  in increments  of,  say,  50  as necessary and as  a  central  bankthat  is  not behind  the  curve,  that  is  not  panicked by an  inflationwhich  is  likely  to  tick  up  1/4  point or  1/2  point  or  something likethat,  but  as  a central  bank that  is  willing to  prescribe moderatelystrong  doses  at  intervals  if  the need is  there.  I think  Don describedit  in his  opening  statement  as  taking a reasonably  routine step  andthen waiting  to  see what happens.I am worried  for  a number  of  reasons,  as  Ed Boehne  is,  aboutthe  signal  that  75  sends.  Don mentioned--I  just want  to underscorethis--that  the  Greenspan  Fed has never  once moved the  fed  funds  rateby 75  basis  points  in  either  direction.  Not  once.  When this  Fed haserred,  it  has been  on the  side of  caution.  When  I was  on  the  outsideas  a citizen,  I always  thought  that was  good  idea.  I would rather  seemy Federal Reserve  err on  the  cautious  side  in  either  direction, andnow  that  I am on  the  inside,  I still  think  the  same.  This Federal11/15/94-43-Reserve, under  our  current  Chairman's  leadership,  has  only oncechanged the  discount  rate by an  amount greater  than 50  basis points.This will  be  the  first  75.  The  75  now will make  it--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  More  than 50  basis  points  in  the  fundsrate?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  No,  the  discount  rate.  There was  a 100  basispoint change  in the  discount  rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am  sorry, that's  right.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  A 75  basis point  increase now will  add up  to175  basis points within  a 6-month period,  if  you  go back and add  theother  50s.  Since  1984,  tightening has  proceeded that  quickly onlyonce--in  the  period that  I mentioned earlier  between March  1988  andthat period to  get  that  pace  of  tightening.Fourthly, I think this  will  be like  feeding  red meat  to  thebond market  lions.  They will  chew it up  and  they will  ask for more.A Federal  Reserve  that  did 25,  25,  25,  50,  50,  75  does not  look  to  anoutside  observer  like  it  is  about  to  stop.  I think we will  createwhat  are  already strong  expectations that  we  are  not  about  to  stop.We will  create,  rather  than diminish,  expectations  of  more near-termtightening  to come--with the potential  that  has  for markets,especially  the  stock market.  That's  at  the  top  of  my worries  aboutthe surprise  that  will  be  created.My personal preference  is  strongly for  50,  for  reasonssimilar  to  those Ed  Boehne mentioned.  The difference,  of  course,  isthat  I have  to  vote.  I thought hard about whether  I should dissent  onthis  matter, and  I did not  decide  until  last  night.  I finally  decidedthat  I won't, but  I want  to  say why because  it  leads  to  a conclusion.I won't  dissent because,  as  I said,  the macroeconomic  difference ofdoing another  25  basis points  today  is  really  quite small.  Secondly,nobody really  knows  about market psychology.  I don't pretend that  Iknow.  I said what  I believe will  happen--that  this will  be  receivedadversely--but  I certainly  could be  wrong.  Finally, I think  it  isbetter  to  show a united Federal  Reserve against  the  criticism that  weare  surely going  to  get  for this  move.  But  I just  want  to  say rightnow that  unless  we receive  some  really surprising news  between now  and20th.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay,  I propose  that  we move  75  withsymmetric  language.

MR. BERNARD.  The proposed  directive  language  is  as  follows:"In  the  implementation of  policy  for  the  immediate  future,  theCommittee  seeks  to  increase significantly the  existing  degree  ofpressure on  reserve positions,  taking  account  of  a possible  increasein  the discount  rate.  In  the  context  of  the  Committee's  long-runobjectives  for price  stability and sustainable  economic growth, andgiving  careful  consideration  to economic,  financial,  and monetarydevelopments,  somewhat  greater  reserve  restraint  or  somewhat  lesserreserve  restraint would be  acceptable  in the  intermeeting period.  Thecontemplated reserve  conditions  are  expected to be  consistent withmodest  growth  in M2  and M3  over  coming months."

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'd like  to  adjourn  this  meeting forjust  5 minutes  so  the  Board of  Governors  can  go next  door and take  upthe  discount rate  question.  Then we  can come  back and  Peter will havethe  floor  to  answer questions  after  I make  some brief  comments.[Recess]Secretary's note:  The  Bank presidents were  informed that  the Boardmembers  at  their meeting  in  the Chairman's  office  had approved anincrease  of  75  basis  points  in  the  discount  rate,  effectiveimmediately for  those Reserve Banks  with pending  increases  of  thatamount.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I want  to  raise  a couple  of  issuesfollowing up  on what  Peter Fisher  said earlier  and  just  open up  thediscussion  to  general  comments.  First of  all,  I understand that  therewere  some  questions  about  statements  coming  out  of Madrid  to  theeffect  that  the  central banks would be playing an  enhanced role  in  theG-7  process.  What  that basically  comes  down  to  is  nothing more thanthe  central  bank deputies  being  involved with the  finance ministrydeputies  in  formulating the  agenda  for  the meetings,  and  that  actuallyis  pretty much what was being done  in  any  event.  We  central bankers11/15/94-45-have  not  in  any way materially  increased our interface with  the  G-7.Indeed,  as  best  I can judge,  and  I may have  indicated this  before,there  seems  to  be more  concurrence  in  those discussions  among  thegovernors  on  the  one hand  and the  finance  ministers  on  the  otherrather  than there  being country positions.  So  long as  that  continues,I think that  the  central  banks will  have  a very  effective andimportant  role  in  the  G-7  process.  Should it  turn  out  at  some pointthat  we  get  involved  in  the politics of  the  finance ministers,  then  Ithink we  had better  give  this  very significant  second thought.  Thereis  no  evidence  of  that  and certainly nothing of  that  sort  wasindicated or  implied  in  the notion of  increased  central  bankactivities  with the  G-7.  So,  nothing has changed  in  any material  way.On  the  issue  of  intervention,  we had some  fairly  interestingdiscussions  earlier  and  I would like  to  lay some  thoughts on  thetable that  have  certain  implications  for  the  future.  I might  addthat,  interestingly, my view about  the way intervention works  issomething that  Hans  Tietmeyer  and I happen  to  agree on.  I am notnecessarily speaking  for  the  Bundesbank, but  I am pretty sure  thatthey would not be  in  severe  disagreement  on  this  issue.First  of  all,  I think there  is  a view in  the  financialcan be.  The analogy  I like  to  use  is  that  irrespective  of  what peoplein  the markets believe,  we  can set  the  federal  funds  rate wherever wewish  to place  it,  and market  trading, market  activities  of  all  sortshave  no  effect.  There are people  in  the  foreign  exchange markets whobelieve  that  we as  central  bankers  have  the  capability of  doing thesame  thing to  the  exchange  rate.  A number of  French  financialofficials  clearly do  believe  that.  A  lot  of  commentators  on theperiphery believe  that  we central  banks  can  fix rates  where we  choose.The  truth  of  the matter  that  I think all  of  us have  acutely recognizedis  that  that  "ain't the  case."As  a consequence,  if  we were  to  announce  what we  are  going  todo with exchange  rates  in  the  way that  we  announce what we will  do  inthe  federal  funds  market,  inevitably  the  financial  community would bedisappointed.  The reason  I say that  is  their belief  that  we  can domore  than we  can;  and when we do  only what we can,  they willnecessarily be  disappointed.We have  all  concluded  that  the only way we can have  an effectin the  exchange markets  on a  short-term basis--because nobody believesthat  sterilized  intervention can have  any  long-term effect--is  tocatch  the markets  by surprise.  If  in  effect we  catch them  in  a shortposition,  it  is  very obvious  that we  can create  a run-up  in  theexchange  rate  and  indeed  that  has  occurred on many occasions.  Therehave  been numerous  occasions when we  failed, when  for one  reason  oranother we  either misjudged that  the  market  didn't  expect  us  to  act  orwe  felt  that we  had  to  act  even  though  the market  knew we were  goingto  act  in order  to  "show the  flag"  as  the  Treasury  likes  to  say  onoccasion.I think  the  important point,  however,  is  that  we  succeed  someof  the  time  because,  if  we create  a presumption  that  we mightintervene, we  establish an  atmosphere  on  the part  of a  lot  of  traders,who  wish to  take  short  overnight positions  against  the dollar,  thatthey  should be  a little cautious.  Indeed,  it  does  seem to  be  the  case11/15/94-46-that  when we have,  in  a sense,  a dull  but nonetheless  a Damocles  Swordhanging over  the markets,  that  often will deter  individuals  fromraiding our  currency.While  I think we all  to  a  greater or  lesser  extent  believe  inefficient  markets,  the  truth  of  the  matter is  that  sometimes  they  arenot.  There  are periods when we  get a  confluence  of  forces  drivingdown  the  exchange rate.  Such  a development may at  times  lead tofunctioning  of  truly efficient  markets.When we were negotiating with Treasury  officials, who  wereconcerned about  the  exchange  rate weakness  that  Peter was  discussing,their  initial  choice  was  to  do  a  full  blown, multiday  intervention,multilaterally.  We argued  that we  started off  with one-day  shotsunilaterally, then one-day  shots multilaterally, and now  they wereproposing multiday  shots, multilaterally, and one had  to ask where wewould go  from  there.  The  argument  that we  put  on  the  table was  to  mixit  up because  if  the  argument  is  that  we cannot  effectively doanything  unless  there  is  a surprise,  we  have  to  create  some  surprises.So,  what we  agreed  to  in this  instance was  that  we  would interveneunilaterally but would do  so  two  days in  a row.  As  Peter points  out,there were some positive  effects  there.  I don't know whether westemmed  the  dollar's decline  effectively, but  clearly one has  to  chalkup  certainly  the  first  day  as  a success.  The  second day was  actually,somewhat  to  my surprise, a mild success.Let  me just  say  that  as  best  I can judge,  and obviously Ican't  read peoples'  minds,  I don't  think  that  the  issue was  theupcoming  election at  that point.  It  is  possible;  I obviously can'targue  against  that,  but  Larry Summers'  recommendations were whollyconsistent  with his previous  positions.  In my judgment  they had nobearing on whether  or not  there  was  an  election coming up.  That  issuedid  come up  in the  news media, and  I must  say that  I find  no  evidenceor basis  to  support  the media  speculation.Larry Summers,  and it  is  possible  the Secretary at  thisstage,  is  still  concerned about  the  dollar and  thinks  that  we  shouldbe  doing something more.  I believe  they would  like  to  see how theoutcome  of  this  meeting gets  reflected in  the market,  but  they stillwould  like  at  least  to  discuss  the  issue of  doing a multilateral,multiday type  of  intervention.  We said we would be  glad to  discussthat  with them.  We have made  no specific  commitments, but  I think  itis  important  for  the  Committee  to  know that  that  issue  is  on  the  tableand  it  will  be  discussed.  It  is  important  to  know what  the  Committee,which authorizes  the  actions on  the part  of  the  Fed  in  this  regard,has  to  say on  this  question before  we go  into discussions  with theTreasury.  But before we  go  to  anything else,  I do  think we  owe  Petera chance  to  answer  some  questions  after which we  are going  to  have  totake  several  votes  for  the  record.  Now, let  me open  the  floor  toquestions  to  Peter.  [Pause]  I do  not believe  that  silence!

MR. FISHER.  This  is  kind of  the  reverse  of  a beating-your-wife  question!

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Just  say  "yes;"  that's  enough!

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes!  I'll  mention one  thing, Mr. Chairman,  thatrelates  to  the  commentary earlier by Governor Lindsey.  Maybe  thiswill  inspire  questions  from  those who  are reluctant  to  dig  in.  Irecognize  in  your  comment  the  idea  that  intervention  takes place  andit  seems  to box  in the  Committee;  the  bridge had  better go  somewhere.I  think both  in  the way you pose  that  and  in  other remarks  at  previousmeetings,  one has  to  say  "compared to what?"  We  don't always  have  thecounter-factual  of  what would have  happened had we not  intervened.  Ithink  the  hypothesis  I worked with and why  I thought  it  was  a goodidea  to  intervene was  the  risk of  an  extreme  event--that  in  earlyquickly.  The range  could have  dropped  to  the mid-140s  on  the mark  andto  94  to  96  dollar/yen.  The market  would have  interpreted  that moveas  entirely related to  the  inaction  of  the  Fed.  I think  the  Committeecould then have  found  itself at  this  meeting in a very different kindof box,  one  that  you would have  liked a  lot  less.  It  would be  a boxthat  is  much harder  to  get  out  of,  one  that  was similar  to  the  box  inwhich  the  Committee found  itself in  July where  to  do  anythingplausible  or reasonable  on  interest rates  would have  looked very badfrom  an  exchange market point  of  view because  it  was  not going  to  beadequate.  That  is,  the  reasonable change  in  fed  funds  for  domesticpolicy purposes would look  like  a sop  to  the exchange  market.  That  isnot  a counter-factual  thing one  can put  one's hands  around, but  onehas  to  think of  what  the  counter-factual  is  to  devise  recommendations--whether  the risks  are  leading  one  to  think  it  is  a good idea  tointervene versus  not.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  There  are two  counter-factuals:  One would benot  intervening and having something happen  at  this  meeting;  the  otherwould be  intervening coupled with a monetary  policy change  at  thetime.  That's  one  you did not mention;  that's  in  fact  the  one  Irecommended.  Had we  done  that,  I think we would have been in  a muchbetter position;  we  would have  been at  50  instead  of  75.  I think wewould have  signaled a policy change  that  is  at  least  intellectuallyconsistent with what we all  believe.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  As  I have  done  in  the past,  let  me  argueagainst  the use of  monetary policy  to  achieve  exchange  marketobjectives.  I am not  necessarily referring  to  this  particularinstance, but  this  is  something I think we have  to  be  aware  of.  Oftenwhen we have  a weak currency, we  are  looking  at significant portfolioadjustments.  Often we  are looking  at  correct  or  incorrect  views ofdifferential  rates  of  return between  two  currencies, not  only ininterest  rates but  also  real  estate,  the  stock market,  all  of  thosethings.  What  history seems  to  tell us,  especially  if  we  look atsomething that may be  an extreme  example  here--the breakdown  of  theEMS--is  that  the  types  of  expected  differential  rates  of  return  aresomething  like maybe  10  basis points  a week.  That's  500  basis pointsor more  at  an annual  rate.  I am concerned  that  if  we  run into  one  of11/15/94-48-those  situations  and we  hit  it  with 50  basis  points  and it  turns  outthat  we  needed 300 basis  points,  the  central  bank  is  caught  in  thedilemma of  whether  or not  to  keep moving the  rate.  I must  say  that  itis  tough  to  envisage our doing  that because  then we would basicallysubvert  domestic policy to  the  exchange  rate,  which I  think none ofus,  yourself  included, wants  to  get  involved with.  I am not  sayingthat  if  we had done  50  basis points,  that  that  might not  have  aneffect  if  in  fact  the  expected differential  rate  of  return between,say,  the  deutschemark and  the  dollar  was  only a  few basis  points.Yes,  it  would have worked, but  I'd be  terribly worried since we  havealmost  no way of making  that  judgment.  We  have to  worry basicallyabout  getting ourselves  into  that process  and  finding  it  verydifficult  to extricate  ourselves  once we  are there.  So  it  is  a highrisk operation.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  There  is  no  question  that we have  no way ofmaking  that  judgment;  that's  what markets  are  for.  That's  why  I thinkit  is  inappropriate  for us  to  take  on  the  job of  guessing  at  somepoint  that  the market  is  oversold  and now  is  the  time  to plunge  in.The  Sword of  Damocles  would hang.  I agree  that  markets  are not  alwaysrational.  When  those  players who  behave  irrationally are punished bylosing money,  the people who  hold the  Damocles  Sword and wield iteffectively are  rewarded by making money.  That's  how  those marketswork.  We are putting ourselves  in  that  position.  So  my first  choicewould be  for us  not to  intervene.  But  I think we  have  to  think  aboutthis  from a public  choice perspective.  Right now,  it  is  absolutelycostless  for  the Treasury  to  decide  to play with what  former  ViceChairman  Mullins used  to  call  that  "little toy in  the  closet."  We allwrote papers  saying we  should never  use  it,  but when we  get  in  theposition of  having  it,  we  just  can't  stop  ourselves  from using  it.  Ifwe are  going to  intervene,  I think  that we gain  two  advantages  byhaving  our general  posture be  that  the  intervention be  coupled with amonetary policy change:  One,  it  is  at  least  intellectuallyconsistent;  the  intervention may work, but  then again  it  may not  work.But  secondly, it  creates  a price  for  the  Treasury.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me  just  say that  I don't  deny thatthere  should be  a relationship.  It  is  just  that  if  it  is  tyingmonetary policy directly to  the  exchange  rate,  it  locks  us  in.  Tohave  it  in parallel paths  or  somehow  related,  I think  the  answer  isobviously yes.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Let's  not  admit  it  to  the world.  But when thephone  rings  in your office,  if  you have behind you the view of  thisCommittee  that  a monetary policy change  will  ultimately accompany anintervention,  you will  have  a weapon  supporting you in  the view  that  Ithink you  really hold,  and that  is  that  intervention should be usedrarely  if  at  all.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  We don't  have  to  exercise  it.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  We don't,  but  I think we  should have  that  asthe  Chairman's weapon.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other comments,  questions?

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Are we  saying  that dollar/yen  is  an  interestrate phenomenon?11/15/94-49-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Differential rates  of  return.  In  otherwords,  if most  of  the  exchange rate moves  these  days against  thedollar are  the result  of portfolio  shifts  rather than, say, currentaccount deficits  or  flows,  then  the  question is  why do  people changeportfolios?  And the  answer  is  that  the  risk-adjusted  rate of  returnis perceived to  be  better  in  one  currency versus another.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  There may be  times  when what you want  to do  formonetary policy purposes  is  consistent with what  the  Treasury wants  todo  to  affect  the  exchange rate.  I have difficulty relating that  towhat Governor Lindsey said.  It  sounds  like  he wanted a tool  for  alltime  for you to put  in the  closet,  and  I don't understand that.  ThisCommittee will  have a view about what is  appropriate monetary policy.It may be  that  today it  would be  consistent with what  the  Treasury maywant to  do,  and that's  good for  today.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  In  point  of  fact, we  had a view;  we  stated itin  our  asymmetric  directive.  It  was quite  clear  what  this  Committeewanted to  do.  It was  quite  clear that  that was  consistent with anappropriate action if  an  intervention  occurred.  And I will  stipulatethat the  Committee's view may vary  from  time to  time.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  My precise  recommendation at  the  last meetingwas  that  because  foreign exchange markets  were  likely to  be unstable,that we go  asymmetric  and have  a 50  basis  point move  as  our explicitprice  for  intervention.  I think  that was  quite appropriate.  I thinkthat  that  would be  the  right  kind of  message for  us  to  send in  thecurrent  environment  if  a multilateral move  or any  kind of  interventionwere to  come  up  in  the  intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  So  the  trip  factor would be  a request  forintervention.  When we have  asymmetry, what we  are  assuming is  that weor  the  Chairman will be  looking at  a set  of  data  that will  lead himperhaps  to  request  a rate  increase.  Are you saying  that  there  is  onedevelopment we are going  to  focus  on and that  is  a request  from theTreasury to  intervene?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  There may be  other reasons  to  adjust monetarypolicy, but  it  should be  clear  that  there  is  a price  associated withintervention.  There  is  a monetary policy change  that  accompanies ourintervention.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I wonder  if  I could put  another  alternative onthe  table--that  we not  intervene  at  all.  I realize that  there  aremany people on  the  Committee who would disagree with that  because  theythink that,  at  least  in a limited way,  intervention may be useful  fromtime  to  time,  and  I certainly  respect those  views.  But  I have  to  tellyou that  I personally have  very serious  reservations  about  the  wisdomof  our  continuing  to  intervene.  Whether we  renew the  swap lines  isrelevant  to  this  discussion, because  in many ways  the  swap linesfacilitate  these  operations and make  them more convenient.  I'll  bebrief here,  but if  I could just  go  through the way I see  this  at  therisk of  some repetition.  As you  said, Mr. Chairman, it  is  now widelyagreed that  sterilized intervention doesn't  have  any sustained  impacton exchange  rates  unless it  sends  a signal  that we are  going to  followit  up with a monetary policy action.  This  implies,  for me at  least,11/15/94-50-and this  is  really the  heart  of  the  matter,  that  it  is  not  reallypossible  for  the  Fed to maintain a truly  independent  monetary policyfor  an  extended period of  time while  following  the  Treasury's  lead  onforeign exchange policy.  Now, of  course,  in reality  the way I seethis  is  that we  have maintained our  independence by not  making acommitment  to  follow interventions  with monetary policy actions.  Butthat's  not  a perfect  situation  either.  I think it  is  a problembecause  of  the possibility  that  these operations  will not  besuccessful.  Of  course, back  in June we had an  operation I think mostpeople would agree was not  successful.  That  really bothers me  fromthe  standpoint  of  credibility because  when we participate  in anoperation like  this  and it  is  not  successful,  we get  associated withthat  result.  Specifically, we  lose  credibility.  It  is  adverse  for usfrom the  standpoint  of public perceptions  about  the  central  bank andwhat we  can do.  I think  that  can reduce  our  effectiveness  over timein conducting monetary policy generally.  It  is  an  important  issue;  itis  a broad  issue.  Again, I would  respectfully submit  that we  ought  toconsider withdrawing from  these kinds  of  operations,  maybe  notimmediately but gradually  in some  way.  This  is  a side  point:  If  wedid  that, we would not need swap  arrangements.  Frankly,  I wouldoppose  renewing  the  swap  arrangements this  morning.  Let me  say  that  Iam not  opposed to  or saying  that  the  U.S. Government  should neverintervene  in  foreign exchange markets.  I am simply saying  that  Idon't  think we  should participate  except perhaps  as  the  Treasury'sagent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You  are  raising an  interesting  question.The  dilemma we have  is  that  if  we withdraw and act strictly as  anagent, we  then  lose any voice  in  altering or casting  the structure  ofthe  policy that  they would  like  to  implement.  The points  you  aremaking, Al,  are quite  to  the point;  I don't  disagree with that.  Thequestion that  we have  to  trade off  here  is,  do we wish to  removeourselves  from  any influence  on  how these  things  are done?  In myexperience,  because we are  involved in  the  discussions, we have headedoff  a lot  of  actions  that  I think would have been detrimental,  more sothan what we  have  done.  There  is  unquestionably the problem  that weare  not  the  final  voice on  that;  legally they are.  Nonetheless, we dohave  a de  facto  veto  if we wish to  use it,  and the  reason we  do  isbecause we participate  in  those discussions.  We have  to choosewhether we want  to  lose what  is  in my judgment  a very valuable assetin  tempering what  the  Treasury Department does.  It  is  not  a simpletradeoff.  If  you are asking me,  do  I disagree with the  way you haveput  it?  I personally don't.  I think that  the  question really getsdown to,  are we as  a nation better  off with  our participating in  thesedeliberations,  granted at  some cost  to  the  Federal  Reserve?  I haveargued  that, yes,  looking at  it  from  the  national point  of view asdistinct  from  the  Federal Reserve  itself,  I think we  are better off.That's  the way I come  out,  and it  is  one of  the  reasons  I havesupported  this  type of  operation.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Well,  again,  I just  worry about  thecredibility effect.  I think  there  is  a negative  there and  I guess  Isee  the  tradeoff  differently.  Obviously, I have  no  personalexperience  in  this  and I respect  your views.  But  is  it  the  case  thatwe would have no  influence whatever  in  these  discussions  if  we werenot participating directly?11/15/94-51-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  ultimately,  I would say,  if  weEither we are  acting  as  an  order taker,  which  is  strictly as  the  agentof  the Treasury, or we get  involved  in the  discussion.  We  either haveto  cut our participation  completely and have  Peter act  as  an  ordertaker with no  conversation  except what he might  say as  a broker--don'tdo  it  now;  the market  is  closed.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  If  the  System  is  not participating  in  theseoperations,  that's  going  to  have  some  effect  in  itself  on  the way theTreasury views  the  operations--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think that  is  the point,  President  Broaddus.Ultimately, we  can and have  declined to  participate.  There have beenoccasions--I  am referring  to  a  long period of  time--when we haveparticipate  can be  a  significant brake  on the  enthusiasm  of  theTreasury--of  all  the Treasuries  that  I have  had anything to  do withover  the years--partly because  the norm  for  the  last  decade  or  so  hasbeen  that  almost  all  operations  are  joint  and all  are on a  50/50 basissince we  have  roughly the  same amount  of reserves.  If  you  said, Peteris  just  their  agent,  the  quality of  our advice would probably beunchanged, but  the  consequences  of  ignoring  it  would be  substantiallyreduced compared to  current  circumstances where  ultimately  it  becomesknown via  the Manager's  reports  whether  the  Federal  Reserve was partof  the  operation.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Al,  I would argue that  we  can't withdraw  from  itcompletely because part of  our statutory responsibility is  thestability of  the  financial  system.  I can envision a situation wherethe  foreign  currency markets were  so  disorderly  that  they were  athreat  to  the  financial  stability  of  the country.  I think  that  totake  us  completely out  of  that would be  a mistake.  Now, the problemis  how to  define  a disorderly market;  who makes  the decision whetherit  is  disorderly;  or whether,  in  fact,  for whatever purpose, we  aretrying  to  peg  or  stop  a decline  in  a rate  relationship.  But  I don'tthink we can  get  out  of  it  completely.  I would  like  to  see us,  as  amatter  of  internal policy,  limit  our participation  to  those  situationswhere  we have  a disorderly market and where we  define  what  is  adisorderly market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's practically what we  try to  do.

[SECTION]

MR.  LAWARE.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I guess  I think if  we  are  out  of  theseoperations,  there  is  less  chance  of  disorderly markets.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I think we have  to  talk as  apractical  matter  about how we would go  about  this  disengagement.  Atthe present  time,  the  Federal  Reserve Bank of  New York operates  as  theagent  for  the  U.S. monetary  authorities, which means  the FederalReserve  and  the Treasury.  The way the conversations  take  place  isthat  the Desk,  Peter and his  colleagues, are  the  technical  advisors.11/15/94-52-Typically,  the  people  at  the  Treasury  talk with Ted;  they  talk withme;  they  talk with  the Chairman;  and  sometimes  they talk with othermembers  of  the  Board as  well.  They get  our  advice and they pay agreat  deal  of attention  to our  advice.  It  is  very, very rare  that  ifwe really say you  should not  do  it  that  they do  it.  The  last  time wedidn't participate  in an  intervention was  in February  1992.  The  factthat  we have  that  threat  can give us  some additional  leverage withthem,  although  I think  it  is  not  something  that  one would wisely usevery often.If  the  Federal  Reserve were  to  decide  to disengage  itselffrom being part of  the  U.S.  monetary authorities  for  foreign exchangepurposes,  we would have  to  announce  that  to  the  world.  We  can't  justlet  it  slip  out.  That  would impress me  as  saying  that  the  FederalReserve--at  the  risk of  some backslapping  to  this  wonderfulinstitution, it  is  a part  of  the  U.S. public  sector  that  isuniversally highly regarded outside  of  our country,  sometimes  evenmore  than the Administration of  the  day--would be  seen by the world asretreating  into  a kind of  Fortress America.  That,  I think, would be  aterrible  signal  to  give.  It  would be  a great  disservice  to  theAmerican people  and a great  disservice  to  financial  stability in  theworld.  Our  ability to  have these  operations done  at  sensible  timesand  in  a sensible way  is  very great,  which obviously brings  upon  theFederal  Reserve  in  general  and  the  Chairman  in particular anadditional  amount  of  responsibility.  It  is  a serious  burden, but  Ithink  one  that we really have no choice  but  to  accept and  carryforward.  There  is  no  question  that  if  we undid  the  swap  lines,  itwould be mainly a signal  to  the  world.  We  haven't drawn on  the  swaplines  since  the  1970s,  if  I remember correctly.  They are much moresymbolic  than real.  But  if  we wanted to  say to  the  rest  of  the worldthat we  are beginning a retreat  into Fortress  America,  it  wouldnaturally be  through  the  swap  lines.  It  is  the  classic  case  of  thedog  that  didn't bark in the  night.  When we renew  the  swap  lines,  itis  such a routine matter  that  nobody pays  any attention.  If  we didn'trenew the  swap  lines,  it  would  create  an  international  hoopla of  veryconsiderable seriousness  and,  I think,  a very negative  one.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We  haven't used the  swap  lines.  Indeed,all  the  intervention  that  has  taken place has been profit-taking,because we have been  selling off  our deutschemark  and yen  reserves.President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mr. Chairman,  this  to  me  is  an exceedinglydifficult  issue  and not one  that  this  central  bank or  any  central  bankin  today's world  can solve by  itself, whether by  any unilateralremarks  and your response  to  Al's comment,  I think,  highlight what  theproblem  is.  Since August  1971,  this country has not  had a policytoward  its  currency;  it  has had a  sequence of policies,  and  sometimesthey are  consistent  internally and sometimes  externally.  Therein liesthe  problem.  It  is  not  just  the  traders  who  don't  know  thatsterilized  intervention cannot  produce  results  inconsistent withdomestic monetary policy, but  sometimes  members of  executive  andlegislative branches  of  the  government,  ours  and  other  governmentsaround  the  world, don't know  that.  The hazard  comes  from  having  thepower to  do  these  things  in the  context of  outside  expectations,  thatwe do not  share,  that  they will work.  I remember being  told that whenPresident  Nixon was  confronted by his  advisors--some  of  the outside11/15/94-53-people--about  the  issue  of  wage/price  controls,  he  said:  I don'tbelieve  in  controls;  I know they won't  work;  and you don't believe  incontrols;  you  know they won't work;  but  the people  don't  know  that.And so  we got  controls.In  the  late  1970s,  we had a policy toward  the  currencyexternally that  was  inconsistent with what at  least  I would want  fordomestic monetary policy.  Earlier  in  the  1970s,  as  we were  thrashingaround  for  a policy, the  Open Market Committee  had  a number  of  debateson  the  issue.  At  one  point, Arthur  Burns made  what  I thought  at  thetime  was  a pretty effective  argument,  that  the only way to  be  certainthat  you  absolutely have  to  intervene  is  to  declare  you are nevergoing  to  intervene  and you will  get  some  asymmetric  bets  in  theforeign  exchange markets.  If  you want  to  be  in  a position where  youdon't  have  to  intervene  in  this  institutional  setting, you have  tospeculation and  so  on.  It  reminds  me of  Charlie Coombs'  beartraparguments.  In  the  early 1980s,  the  Treasury  tried out  the  idea  ofviewed that  experience,  the Treasury Department  abruptly changed ourcurrency policy at  the beginning of  1985  in  association with  the  PlazaAccord and the  Louvre  Accord and all  of  that.  It  is  troubling to methat  nothing  has  changed institutionally.  In going  forward, we  canagain  find ourselves  in  a position with an executive  or  a  legislativebranch view that  we  can or  should have  a policy  toward our  currency inthe  international  markets  that  is  incompatible with what  thisCommittee  thinks  is  appropriate  for  domestic markets.  We  ought  toattack  that  policy issue  as  something that  our  government  in  itstotality needs  to  address.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I  think that  if  we  were  towithdraw in that  way, it  would create  a wound that  could very easilybe  opened at  almost  any time.  It  would  indicate a continuing disarrayin  U.S.  financial management  to  any  serious  observer,  official  orprivate.  I think it  could have  very deleterious  consequences  in  anongoing way and  in ways  that  would be  impossible  to  foresee.  Therewould always  be  a question about where U.S. policy was  and where  theFederal  Reserve was  relative  to  the Treasury.  Furthermore,  I thinkthat  frankly  it  would be a display of  unseemly arrogance if  thecentral  bank were  to  walk away  from  its  Treasury in  that manner,essentially being seen as  thumbing  its  nose at  the  government  or maybeholding  its nose.  I just  don't  think that  that  would sit well  withother governments;  I don't  think it  would  sit well with  the Congress.We see  ourselves as wanting  to  be  independent  in managing monetarypolicy  for very good reasons,  and  I don't  want  to poison  the well  forthe wrong  reasons.  I am afraid  that  would do  it.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I am very sympathetic  to  that point  of  view.  Idon't  think  that  in practice we  could withdraw.  On  the other hand,  Ialso know  that we  have  a Treasury  that  likes  to  intervene more  than wewould like  it  to  intervene.  What  I would  like  to  do  is  give you, Mr.Chairman, an  extra weapon to  say  "no."  The only  extra weapon  that  Ican  think of,  the  only extra  bargaining  chip  that we  can give  you,given that  I don't  think we  can do what Al  wants  and given  that  we  areintervening too  much,  is  the  implicit  threat  that we  will  view theprice  of  exchange  rate  intervention as  being an  interest  rate  change.11/15/94-54-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I used  to  comfort  myself with the  observationthat  since  sterilized  intervention  really didn't  affect  anything,  itprobably really wouldn't  harm anything  either, a sort  of  a no-harm-no-foul  kind of  rule.  But  I have  come  to  the  conclusion  that  sterilizedintervention does  have  some  cost.  Al  just  cited  the  credibilityissue.  Also,  I am observing  that  this  Committee has  a  lot  ofdiscomfort  with  these operations.  I don't know where  that goes  beyondwhat we  are already doing  in  the  sense  that we  probably ought  to  keepthese operations  to  a minimum  to  the  extent we  can, unless  we believethat  for  monetary policy reasons we are  going  to  do  some  unsterilizedintervention;  that's  a different  story.  Also,  I would  say  that  Ithink  this  discussion  is  helpful.  More  communication about what  weare doing  and why would be helpful.  When we do  get  involved  inintervention,  it  is  very hard  from  time  to  time  to  understand exactlywhat prompted it  on  that  occasion when  it  didn't  prompt  it  on  otheroccasions.  Sometimes,  there  doesn't  seem  to be any particular patternor  rationale.  I would certainly  feel  more comfortable with it  all  ifI knew what  it  was  about  the  circumstances  in  question  that promptedthe action.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I want  to  call  on  Ted because  Ted hasbeen  around here  in  this  area  longer  than all  of  us put  together.  Iam curious  as  to  how he would respond to  this.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  On  the  communications question?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  on  this  general  broad  issue--theprinciples,  which you  infer,  that  various  Treasuries  have  employedover  the years.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I  think President  Jordan  is  absolutely right.In a  sense, we  are  suffering from  the  fact  that  various  Treasurieshave had a sequence  of  ad hoc  or at  least  temporary policies  for  ourcurrency.  I  think  that relates  both to  the  international  value andthe  domestic  value.  Those  two  things  are  bound up and are  inherent  inthe  discussion  that we had  earlier  this  morning  about whether theforeign  exchange value of  the dollar  in  part  should be an  overt  targetfor  monetary policy.  Given  the  current way  things  are  structured inthe  U.S.  government,  it  is  difficult  to  predict where  a particularTreasury or Administration will  be  on  this  matter.  Administrations  dochange  and  it  is,  unfortunately I think,  an  area where personalities,or maybe  I should say philosophies,  matter  to  a  somewhat  surprisingdegree.  The  evidence on  the  effectiveness  of  intervention is  mixed,but  I think  the  academic profession would say  today that  the pendulumhas  swung back somewhat  on  the question  of  the  effectiveness  ofsterilized  intervention, and not  just  through  the  signaling channelsconnected  to  monetary policy but  also  the  signaling  channels  connectedto  other policies.  I think it  is  fair  to  say  that,  as  on many otherissues  in  economics,  experts  lie  all  along  the  spectrum.  [Laughter]  Ithink that's  right.  I have  felt  that  over  the  years  the  FederalReserve  has  on  balance been a very positive  force  in  trying  tomodulate  the  excesses  of  various Administrations.  It  has  not  alwaysbeen  easy and  often  the  Federal  Reserve has  found itself  leaning  toone  side  of  the  boat because  the Administration  or particular peoplein  control  of  the Administration were  leaning  to  the  other  side  of  theboat.  This  has  involved a certain  amount of  moving  from one side  to11/15/94-55-the  other,  though  I think the  basic objective has  been  to make  surethat  if  the  instrument  is  used, it  is  used sensibly, not overused,  andone  does not  exaggerate  its  effectiveness or  ineffectiveness.To  comment  if  I may on Governor Lindsey's price message, thatis  certainly  in  one  set  of  circumstances  something we  do and have doneimplicitly in one  form or  another.  There  is  another  side to  it,  if  Iin  that period, which was promoted by the  Administration at  the  time,was  that  that was  the device which in the  end was needed  to convincethe Administration that what  they saw as bitter medicine had to betaken in  October  1979;  it was  necessary.  It  took  18  months  toconvince  the various people  in  the Administration,  as well  as maybesome people within the  Federal  Reserve,  that  that was necessary.  Itis  difficult  to  come  to  the  question  of  disorderly markets narrowlydefined.  I don't want  to  get  into  this.  I think you might  not wantto  use monetary policy, so  that  it  would be  only a club  in  the  closetunder the  right circumstances.  I think  the various  German and otherofficials who  have  been involved with us  have used it  that way.One  further comment:  I haven't  gone back and checked  therecord precisely, so  I apologize  if  I go back and find  that  I ammistaken.  I would not characterize  this  Administration as beingparticularly trigger-happy  in this  regard.  They have  intervenedrelatively few times.  Aside  from the  Administration in  the period ofthe  early  1980s,  they  are probably the  least  active.  The onedifference  of  strategy  that  the  current Administration has  followed,consistent  with what  the  Chairman has  said and probably notaccidentally,  is  that  when  they wanted  to  operate,  they have wanted tooperate  in  significant volume  to  get  the market's  attention.  GovernorMullins  commented at  one point  that  one could view intervention tosome extent  as  a type  of  circuit breaker  in  the market.  If  you hitthe market hard enough,  it  forces  the market  to  stop under somecircumstances  and it  gives  the  market the  opportunity  to  stop  and say:Do  they  know something we don't know, which could be monetary policyor  a variety of  other things?  In  order to  do  that, you need  the rightscale  of  circuit breaker  to  get  their  attention.  I think  thisAdministration has  tended to  be much more deliberate in  its policy ofwanting to  operate  on a larger scale.  But  in terms  of  the number  ofdays  of  operations,  they  have  tended  to  be  toward the  lower  end ofrecent  experience.  We  are less  than  two years  into  the Administrationand all  this  could  change, but that's  something  I wanted to  point out.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I have a reservation about  Larry's  suggestionabout  the  linkage  of a visible  domestic policy  action tied withintervention promoted by  the  Treasury.  That's because  of  theasymmetry  that  would be  involved if  we  were to  get  into  a world whereconfidence  shifts  around and capital  flows  were starting  to  put  somevery substantial upward pressure on  the U.S.  dollar.  If  we had aTreasury that  decided they wanted  to  rebuild  the  cookie jar  or  the warchest,  I certainly would not  want  to  couple cuts  in  the  fed  funds  ratewith  their mandates  to  intervene  in  the  opposition direction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman, I am sure  it  is  nosecret  to  the  Committee that  this  kind of  a debate11/15/94-56-that  there is  not wild-eyed enthusiasm for  intervention on  thisCommittee.  In  fact,  that  they  know that  is  a very helpful  tool  for us.We don't need you are  describing;  it  is  already  there.thatThey know very well

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Can  I just make  one  very quick  final  comment,and I appreciate you  letting me make my other  comments  earlier, Mr.Chairman.  Let me  just  say that  I am not  a Fortress America guy.  Idon't want  to be  arrogant,  but  for me  one of  the  highest priorities wehave  is  always  to  protect our  independence  in  the  conduct  of  monetarypolicy.  My only  concern here  is  that  intervention activities  threatenthat  at  least  to  a degree,  and it  is  very, very difficult to  fine-tuneit.  That's  the  key point  from my standpoint.  I hope  that  that willbe very much  in our minds  going  forward with all  these  operations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.I have certainly  heard all  the  arguments  here  and I mustsay  that  I have  great  sympathy.  My own view is  that  I wish Treasurywouldn't do  it  and I wish we wouldn't  do  it.  I think  that would solvea  lot  of  problems  because I am not  convinced  that  that's  the way  tostabilize  our nation's  currency.  I don't  deny that  there  areoccasions  where intervention  actually does  stabilize  the  market.  Thetrouble  is  I can  think of  situations  where  intervention destabilizesit.  I am not  sure  that  one can argue  that  there is  a net  advantage  tointervention.  Nonetheless, we do  have very practical  difficulties,which I think  a number  of  people  around  this  table have  indicated.This  far along  in the  process, post-1971,  we would create  some  veryextraordinary events  if  we were to  endeavor unilaterally  to pull  awayfrom  this  sort  of  activity.  So we  are going  to  be  involved in  it  andas  a consequence, we  are  going  to  need Committee  authority onoccasion.  I'd  like Ted  to  raise  the  issues  that  are  involved here  inthe  event,  for example,  that  we get  into  these discussions  with theTreasury and  they come up with  something that we  find  not  fullyunreasonable.  That's  an  odd way of putting it,  but  that's  the  way  itcomes  out  and  I will  ask Ted to  outline  some  of  the  issues.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Maybe I'll  just  add one  footnote  to  the historybefore  I pick up  on your comment.  After  1971,  of course,  we did notintervene  for  quite  an  extended period  of  time--March 1971  to July1973.  It  was  Arthur Burns  and  President Hayes  who  essentiallyprevailed upon the  Treasury to  take  that  small  instrument  out of  thecloset.  It may have been  a big mistake  but  that  was  what happened.That's  just  one  example  of  where,  for better  or  for worse,  thisCommittee  at  that  time  found  itself quite  supportive of  interventionbecause  it  was  a question  of  caring about  our  currency, at  leastthat's how it  was  perceived.  As Governor  Blinder  said earlier in  themonetary policy discussion, we  are dealing  in an  area where we  cansometimes  prejudge perceptions  with great  confidence.As  the  Chairman  said, the  Treasury has  talked about  amultinational, multiday operation  that would be  relatively small  inscale  at  least by historical  standards,  but where  we might  operatesuccessively for  3 to  5 days.  We  might  imagine  the U.S.  authoritiesthinking in  terms  of  a budget,  if  I may put  it  that way, of  $6 billionof  sales,  half  of  which would come  from  the  System and  half would come11/15/94-57-from  the  Treasury under  normal  procedures.  If  we did  that, we  wouldas  a technical  matter  have to  come  to  the  Committee  for  clearance  toincrease  the  limit  on  the  change  in  the  System's  overall  open positionduring  the  intermeeting period.  The  limit  is  now set  at  $1-1/2billion.  The  clearance would be  for  a larger  reduction  in  our  overallopen position.  The  clearance  is  needed regardless  of  the direction weare going.  We would raise  that--up  to,  say,  $3 billion  so  that  wecould  accommodate this  type  of  operation.  I guess  the  only proceduralmatter would be  that  if  events  over the  next  few weeks  lead  theChairman  to  think that  that  is  the  right thing  to  do,  we would come  toyou to  get  your clearance.  This  is  not,  as  technical  matter, a vote;it  is  a procedure  that  is  partly designed to  meet,  though maybeimperfectly, the Committee's  desire--a  desire  reiterated by PresidentStern earlier--to have  some degree  of  communication  about  what we  aredoing, maybe  not why we are doing  it.  It  may provide opportunities  toask why we  are  doing  it,  as  has  happened in  some of  our  conferencecalls.  It  is  a mechanism that  has  been  set up  both to  keep  thisCommittee  informed and  to  review these matters.  After it  is  all  over,you can review whether it  was  a success  or  failure  or why it  was  asuccess  or  failure.  Procedurally, it  does put  everything on  thetable.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  let me raise  one  additional  issuehere.  You may recall  that  in an  earlier discussion, you were  lookingfor ways  to  restrict  the size  of  our  operations.  You wanted  to  try todisgorge  some  of  our  foreign  exchange  reserves.  When we  intervene  insupport  of  the dollar, we are moving  in  that  direction.  We aresqueezing down our capability  of  acting  and squeezing down  the wholeoperation.  I am not  sure  the Treasury  thinks  this way, but  therereally is  an asymmetry here whereby we  should be more  resistant aboutactions  in which we  are buying  foreign currencies  to  support  thembecause  that  expands  our reserves.  Whereas  were we  to  do  anything  tosupport  the dollar,  even if  it  failed, we would accomplish  something--namely we  would reduce  our foreign  exchange  reserves.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  And at  a profit.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  at  a profit.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It  sounds  to  me that  you  are  saying that  we  areacting  in  order  to  restrain our  ability  to  act,  and  I am not  sure  thatthat makes  a lot  of  sense.  Ted referred to  opportunities  to  discussproposed  operations  in  conference calls.  Now, one  of  the greatbeauties  of  the U.S.  Constitution, which makes  our foreign policyadversaries  furious,  is  the  Senate's  right  to  say  "no."  My realquestion  for  Ted is:  Do we have  the  right to  say  "no"?  If  we hadthat  right,  in  other words  if  actual  vote  approval  of  this  Committeewere  required, the  sticks  in  the  closets would  be quite numerous andthat might be  quite  an  appropriate move.  If  it  is  just  to  notify usand have us  ask questions,  I think that's  a different  issue.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  This  is  obviously a matter  for  the Committee  towere  in  fact  to  provide  greater restraint on  our  interventions  thanhad  existed.  For  example,  on  the  domestic  side  there  is  a  limit  onthe  intermeeting  change  in the  System's overall  holdings  of  U. S.government  and Federal  agency securities,  but  that  limit  is  verysubstantial and  is  occasionally raised.  On  the  foreign  side,  the11/15/94-58-procedural  instructions  are written  the way  they are because  it  isalso  judged  that  in some  circumstances--given  the  international  natureof  these  discussions  since  they don't  just  involve  the  United StatesTreasury but  often  at  least  two  or  three other  central  banks--theyshould provide the  Chairman  with some degree  of  flexibility to  act  onbehalf  of  the Committee  as  long  as  it  is  consistent with the  foreigncurrency authorization  and  the  foreign currency  directive.  We havesubsequent  discussions  and provide  a way  for  the Committee  to  beinformed--in contrast  to  the  situation that  existed before  1976  wherethere  could be very large  operations  and, unless  the Committee memberskept score  as  they went along,  they wouldn't know how much had beenbought  and  sold until  the next  Committee meeting.  The existingprocedural  instructions  are  designed that  way, but  you can  changethem.  On  balance,  I think  they work pretty well,  but  obviously  therehas  been a  range of  views  on all  the  issues  in  that  respect.  I thinkone of  the  purposes  of having  this  discussion was  in  fact,  as  the ViceChairman  said, in  order  to  give  the  Chairman  some basis  to havefurther  discussions  of  this with the  Treasury  and  other  central banks.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  just  getting back to  what you  saidearlier, my worst  fear  about what  I just heard was  that  it  may workthe  first  time  [Laughter]  and  give  some  people confidence  that  thatcan be a  substitute  for  getting the  fundamentals  right.  I'd  just pickup  on something you  said earlier.  Maybe  the  secret  is  to  keep  somevariety in here.  I'd hate to  see  us  get  into  a mode where  there wassome perception that  it would be  appropriate just  because  it  workedonce.  The markets  are  so much bigger  than we  and all  the  othercentral  banks put  together  are.  Once  it  becomes  known as  a mode  ofoperation  and the  surprise  element  is  gone,  I don't  think  it  couldwork on a  sustained basis.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  that's  absolutely right.  PeterFisher.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I just wanted to  add a  footnote  to your  comment,Mr.  Chairman,  about  taking  the profits  on  the  long position.  One  ofthe  things  that  people  in the  market  do  focus  on  is  that  theaccumulation of  reserves since  the  late  1980s  implies  asymmetry in  theU.S.  appetite  for  intervention.  That  is,  we are  more prepared to  holddown the  value  of  our currency  than we  are  to defend it.  That  initself  is  a major market  negative  among  the  analysts who  look  at  ourbehavior.  That's  not  a particular reason  to  intervene  on  any day  orfor  any kind of  operation, but  it  is  a reflection  of  the  negative

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions,  comments?  Yes,Tom.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I don't have  a question.  In  terms  of  thisconversation and where  it  has drifted,  I am not quite  sure  what we are

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  What  I understand, Mr.  Chairman,  is  that  we havebeen  operating  in  a very restricted way in  the  sense  that  if  there  isa disorderly market or  some other  fundamental development, you  andothers  come  together  knowing  that  this  Committee  is  generally11/15/94reluctant  to  intervene.  But  it  depends  on  circumstances  and theproposed  intervention  is  thought  through pretty  carefully.  I assumethat's how we  are  talking  about  going  forward  from here.  If  it  is,  Ifeel  comfortable  with that.  If  we  are  talking  about  changing  tolarge,  multiday operations  for different  reasons  than this  limitedcontext,  then  I would have  trouble with  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  I think that's  right.  I agree withthat.  My own personal  belief,  I think,  is  probably  fairlyrepresentative of  this  Committee.  If  anything,  I might  be more,  if  Irecognize  that  we have very  important  responsibilities.  I think  it  iscrucially important  for  the  Federal  Reserve as  an  institution  to  be  aplayer here.  I think basically that  is  what  Governor  LaWare  andGovernor Kelley were saying.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Let  me  come  back to  where you  started thediscussion with  one question  that  has been kicking around  for weeks--whether we  should do  something not  routinely larger but nonroutinelylarger  in  the  interest  of  varying  the  tactics.  I see  some heads  goingthis  way around  the  table but,  of  course,  that's  one  risk.  I thinkthe  other view of  this matter has  emphasized that  one  risk we  see  isif we  do  it  once,  it might  become a bad habit.  But  depending on  howthe market  reacts  to  developments  over  the next  several  days  or weeks,a possibility is  that  we might  have  an  operation that  is  a  littlelarger  in scale  and a  little  bit more sustained as  a way of  varyingthe  pattern of  behavior but not necessarily something  that  wouldbecome  a new pattern.  I just  wanted  to make  it  clear  that--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let  me put  it  this  way.  If  it  is  done,it  would be  a one-shot  thing because  if  we  ever try to  do  it  a  secondtime,  it  would  fail.  That  is  what would happen.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Nothing  is  more  sure  than  that.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It would be  in  the  face  of  disorderly markets,right, Ted?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think I have been around  too  long  to  be  ableto  give  you  a precise definition  of  what is  a disorderly market.

[SECTION]

MR. MINEHAN.  I know you can't,  but we wouldn't  just  do  it  toprove  we  could do  it.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Let  me  try to  do what  I just  said  I can't  do.Disorder to  some  extent  is  in the  eyes  of  the beholder.  Sometimes wehave  a situation where the  dollar is  weaker  than  the  fundamentalswould  justify.  Sometimes  the weakness  has  to  do with marketconditions.  Both  situations have been  used.  Although  I know  thereare preferences  for being more precise,  there also  are  preferences  forbeing  less precise.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I think  there  is  a distinction  to  be  drawn.  Ithought  the  November 2nd and 3rd  interventions were  helpful because  ofthe perception  of  disorderliness  in terms  of  the Administration'sback-and-forth approach  to  the  dollar.  I think  it  was  helpful  interms  of  the  country's  credibility that  we did  intervene  and  that  theintervention was  successful.11/15/94-60-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Certainly,  it  was  successful!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  That's  true.  The reason  may be,  as  you said,that  it  came  at  a surprise  moment  and  that  contributed to  the  success.I would worry if  in  the  absence  of  a  surprise--well,  I don't  know howone  can know  this  except  after  the  fact.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Not  to  put  words  in your mouth, we  could becapricious  or  appear  to  be  capricious  about why we are  operating.  Weought  to  have some  sense of  what we are  trying  to  accomplish  and whywe were  trying  to  do  it  even  though  it  is  not  always  very wellarticulated.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We will  all  starve  if  we don't  stop  thisdiscussion!

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We need two votes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Whatever you have  to  say,  say  it  in halfthe  time.  I think President Jordan has  the  floor.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  On  this  issue of  how the  intervention  isperceived, the Federal  Reserve  does  not  issue  statements  at  the  timeforeign currency  actions  are  undertaken.  My feeling aboutintervention would be  significantly  influenced by what  is  said,  and  Ihope  that  your  contribution is  significant not  only  in  terms  of whatis  done, when, and  how much, but  also  what  is  said about  it.  I don'thave  any problem with  taking  the  capital  gains  from our previousefforts  to  short  the  dollar  against  foreign  currencies.  I am not veryhappy about  the  capital gains  we are  going to  take because  the  onlyway a central bank  can avoid  taking a  loss  on foreign  currency assetsis  if  its domestic policies  have not produced  stability and itscurrency has depreciated.  We have  accumulated big capital  gains,  andI am willing  to  cover  our shorts,  take  our gains,  and  limit  ouroptions  to  do  that  again  in  the  future,  I hope!
