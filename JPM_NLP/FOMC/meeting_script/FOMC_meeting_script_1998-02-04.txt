[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I renominate  Peter Fisher.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If there are any other nominations, Peter mayobject, but that is probably irrelevant!  I assume there  are none.  Would  somebody like tosecond  that nomination?

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Now  that he is  officiallyensconced, we can  go back to  work.  Peter, you  are  on.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  All right, Mr. Chairman.  I sent a memorandum  to the Committeesuggesting two modest changes to the Authorization  for Domestic Open  MarketOperations.  I think that is the  next item.  One is  a permanent  increase in  the intermeetingleeway from $8 billion  to $12  billion.  The other is to remove from the  Authorization  thereferences  to bankers acceptances  that have been  inoperative  lo these many years.  I thinkthe memorandum speaks  for itself.  I would be happy to answer any questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If there are no questions,  would somebody  like tomove amend the  Authorization as  proposed?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move approval  of the Authorization  withthe modifications proposed in Mr. Fisher's memo.

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  I sent a memorandum  to the Committee containing  the currentversions of the  Foreign Currency  Authorization,  the Foreign  Currency  Directive, and theProcedural Instructions.  No amendments  are recommended.  The memorandum  includes2/3-4/98a review  of the warehousing  authority, also with no  proposed amendment  of the currentarrangement of $5  billion.  I will  answer any questions.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Peter, you are on  again  for yourreport on Desk operations.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the three pagesof color charts that were placed in  front of you before  the meeting started.  1/The first page updates  the charts I have  shown before on current  and forwardthree-month deposit rates.  In this case,  I am presenting a full  13  months of data soyou can  see recent developments  in the context of a longer period of time.  If youlook at the top panel,  shown in red, you can  see the abrupt downward  shift in U.S.forward  rates that occurred  right  after the New  Year.  I think it is interesting thatnot much else has  happened other than an  abrupt move down.  The forward ratesdo not show much  of a rising rate environment or falling rate expectations.  Theyare flat and  right on top of one another  after their downward  shift, which  I willcome  back to in  a minute.  The flattening of the forward  deposit rate curves  reallybegan in late October when the  Dow lost 554 points.  It is quite dramatic  how flat1/ Copies  of the charts used by Mr. Fisher are  appended  to the transcript.  (Appendix  1)2/3-4/98the forward curves  of expected  three-month  rates have  become for the UnitedStates.Looking  at the middle panel for Germany,  shown in blue, you  can  see thecontinued modest  decline  in German  forward rates.  I think this continues to reflectthree factors.  First, there is  a widening consensus  that when the European  centralbank comes into existence  12  months from  now, the initial policy rate is likely tobe  in the mid to low 3  percent range,  and that is down  from market expectations  ofhigher rates.  I think there has been  a widening  appreciation  that the Asian crisiswill  have  a  greater impact in Europe  than the Europeans  initially thought,  and thathas begun  to weigh on the outlook for economic  activity  in Europe.  I believe thosetwo developments  combine to create a third factor in  that the market  really seesvery little risk of a pickup in  activity in  the German economy  or the Europeaneconomy  more generally  in the months  ahead, so rates  have been winding down inEurope.In the  green bottom panel, you can  see  at the lower right that there has beensome rise in forward  rate expectations  in Japan  as we have moved into the NewYear, but the  curve is still very flat.  I find it interesting that the forward rates  havebacked  up a  little, but the rise  is not close to being  as dramatic  as the movements inthe Nikkei and the yen  in reaction  to what the markets  have  seen as a veryaggressive move by the Ministry of Finance  to try to stabilize  the financial  sectorand undertake  some stimulus in the economy.  I think it is noteworthy  that theforward rates depicted  here  are nowhere  near the  levels that they reached last Maywhen there  last was  something  of a burst of optimism,  in the  Japanese  context  atleast, regarding  the possibility that the tax  impact that  came in with this fiscal  yearmight not be as  bad as feared,  and there  were some  hopes the Japanese  economymight start recovering.  The point here  is that we are  not even near those  levelseven  if there is  some modest uptick in the Japanese  forward  rates.Turning to the second page,  I would like to delve into the  question  of how tointerpret recent  movements in the U.S.  Treasury  yield curve.  In the top panel, youcan  see 30-,  10-,  and 2-year Treasury yields  in green  and the implied  fed fundseffective rate  in red from the April  fed funds futures contracts as they traded inof market participants,  myself included,  who thought that with the start of the newyear we would  begin to see a modest backup  in yields.  The  backup  was notexpected to be  dramatic,  but it was thought that yields  would rise at least to thelevels that existed  in early December.  This would occur  as a consequence  of theunwinding of a year-end  flight to quality when investors  were rushing out ofemerging  markets and into U.S.  Treasuries.  The thought was this would begin tounwind itself during January.  In particular,  the managers  of a number of majormortgage-backed  securities  portfolios  took that  view.  They may  have  gone  homefor the  New  Year holiday  somewhat short of their normal duration  targets with  the2/3-4/98idea that they would be  able to catch up more easily in the gently rising yieldenvironment  they expected to see in January.At the start  of the year, there  were three surprises for the market that came veryquickly  and changed  that outlook rather dramatically.  One was  a shift inexpectations for monetary  policy. The  second was a rather  sudden jump in demandfor Treasuries  and other securities  stemming from the Asian  crisis, some  actual  andsome anticipated  demand.  The third was confirmation  of a  changed  outlook in thesupply of Treasury securities.  Let me  go over  each  of those.The first came  as  a result of the Chairman's  speech,  and its market  effect isdepicted in  the area  of the chart associated  with the line  marked  "January 3."  TheChairman  discussed  the  problems of price measurement  in a  low inflationenvironment,  and over that  weekend the market  interpreted his comments  to meanthat the Committee  and the Federal  Reserve  had moved to  a symmetric  outlook onthe risks for policy.  Later that  week, after Governor  Meyer's  speech  on January  8,which included  a discussion  of easing, the market jumped  on that part  of thespeech and  interpreted  it as meaning  that the Committee  probably had a  slight biastoward an easing move  or, if you will,  that the greater  probability was  now in thedirection  of an easing  in policy.  I am not  passing judgment on whether either ofthese interpretations  represented  a fair reading  of the texts,  but that is the  way thequite  significant  shift in expectations  for the  stance  of monetary  policy.Two  other things happened  that week.  One, at the beginning  of January  therewas  a further sharp  depreciation  of a number  of East  Asian  currencies  as businesscorporations  in  those countries  rushed into the markets to try to hedge theirexposures  for the new year.  It  was  a rather ham-handed, inexperienced  effort tohedge  their dollar exposures.  They had avoided the thin  markets  in December inthe expectation  of jumping into  the thick markets  of January,  but  they found thatthey were  causing the currencies  to move rapidly away from them.  That gave afurther boost to the dollar and  a further  anticipation  of very strong demand cominginto the Treasury  market.The third factor, not to be overlooked,  is that on Monday, January 5,  the WhiteHouse announced  its expectation  that  the fiscal budget for  1999 would  be inbalance.  While the  market knew developments  were  moving in  that direction, thatnews  hit the market  the  same day that it had its first  opportunity to  respond to theChairman's  speech over that weekend.All of these developments  taken  together, which  may have  caught some  of themajor players  slightly short of their duration  targets,  led to something  of a rush.You  can  see in the  top panel of Chart 2 that in  the first week in  January both the2-year  and the  10-year  rates  moved down through  the fed  funds target rate leveldepicted by the solid black horizontal  line.  I think the challenge  is how to weigh  or2/3-4/98untangle  the three  different factors:  the  shift in  expectations,  the supply, and thedemand  factors influencing  the market.In the middle panel  on  the left, the implied yields in  fed funds  futures aredepicted from now  through August.  The implied fed funds rate  curves are  shownfor December  16,  the date  of the Committee's last meeting, for January 9, the endof that first heady week of January,  and for last Friday, January  30, when  ratesbacked up  a little.  In the right panel  is a  snapshot of the Treasury yield curve forthe same  three dates.  As I look at the fed  funds rate curves  in the panel  on the left,I see that the market  is pricing  some probability but not the certainty  of an easingaction.  It is not a particularly strong  expectation  that policy will be eased any timein the next six months,  but clearly that is the direction where  the probabilities lie.With regard to the Treasury yield  curves shown  in the middle panel  on the right,many market  participants  look at the fact  that the 2-year note  is now tradingsignificantly below the funds rate  and take that  as  a very strong  sign or convictionthat an easing move is near at hand.  Indeed, over the last decade each  time that the2-year note has traded  definitively through the funds rate, there has been an easing inpolicy within the following three months.  So,  there is some historical  backgroundfor that view.  But I believe  it is  important to  keep  in mind when  we try to interpretthe yield curve that the  fed funds futures  contracts and the forward rates  suggest onlysome probability of an easing in policy rather  than a certainty.  When  I look at theyield  curve, I see a  strong conviction  that there  will be  no tightening within the nextsix months, and I think that conviction  is permitting  the rather novel  set of demandand  supply conditions to migrate  into the intermediate  sector of the curve and therebypromote greater confidence  among investors  that they can  carry 2-  and 5-year paperwithout the risk of a backup  in rates induced  by the  Committee.I would note two things.  First, the entire bill  curve, even  in the  1-year sector,was already below the  federal funds  rate at the time of the Committee's  lastmeeting.  Moreover,  while the entire yield curve--from 3  months to  30 years or 3months to  10 years depending on  how you slice it--  has  declined a bit over theintermeeting period, the coupon curve  from 2 to 30 years actually  steepened  overthe same  even  as it shifted slightly lower.  So, while there clearly  has been a  shiftin policy expectations in  the market, I for one  do not think it  is as pronounced  as astraight reading of the intermediate  sector of the yield curve might lead one  toconclude.In the bottom panel  of page 2, you can see the movements  in the dollar and geta sense of the run-up  in the  dollar that occurred  at the end of last year and the firstfew days  of this year.  Clearly,  the yen strengthened  over the course of January asthe Ministry of Finance  worked very hard to  communicate  their intent to  stabilizethe financial  sector of the  Japanese  economy. I would note that the dollar/mark  isvery little  changed over the period  from the high  levels  it reached  at the end of theyear.2/3-4/98Turning to the last page  of charts,  I will briefly  discuss our open  marketoperations  during  the period.  I would like to make just a few points.  First, in thefirst maintenance  period  shown  on the  left side of the upper  panel, we had bothpronounced  softness  in the market  around the Christmas holiday  and then theyear-end  pressures;  so, we had a ying-yang  maintenance  period.  We tried tomanage  both that  softness and  then the firmness.  In the next  maintenance  period,which  ended January  14,  we began  the period by adding reserves,  but wesubsequently had  repeated days of fog-induced  float that led to a certain  sogginessin the market.  So, we ended up being on the other side of the  market, drainingreserves that resulted  from a considerable  rise in float.  Early in the third period,on January  16,  the unexpected  size of corporate  tax payments  led to a  miss of justunder $3  billion in our projection of the Treasury balance.  That contributed to avery high fed  funds rate, which rose  as  high as  20 percent  on that day,  and therewas  some borrowing  from the  discount window.  So, January  16  was one of thedifficult days  we faced during this period.  I would note that in the current periodjust under way, which  is not depicted here,  we  again  were supplying reserves  inthe last few days  in  anticipation of the settlement on  new Treasury  securitiesyesterday.  Today, we have been  draining  reserves.  We knew we would in  facthave this heightened demand yesterday,  but we  anticipated  soggy conditions  as wecame to the end of the period.I would also  like to mention  something not depicted  in these charts to makesure  the Committee  members are  all aware  of the transactions  in question.  Justbefore  Christmas, we confronted  an order from  the Japanese  authorities to sellin Treasury bills.  In the  absence  ofof bills into the SOMA account,selecting bills that we would be able to run off in the  course of January  so as notto make our need to drain reserves  any worse  at the end of the month.  We  soldout of the repofor them in the market  and took another We took pool,  where we have had an elevated cash balance  for them, to help them in effectto meet their cash needs.  We also actually  arranged  a transaction  between  theBank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance during  the period;  one  wanted to sellbills and  the other to buy.  This transaction was associated  with their very heavyintervention  in late January,  and  we tried to organize the  financing this way tominimize  the  impact on the  bill market.  At the  same time, my colleagues  at theBank  of Japan were  faced with  the problem of how to sterilize the intervention onthe other side  and get  enough yen  back into their market  to avoid a spike  in rates.I just wanted to inform the Committee  of these transactions.We had no foreign exchange  operations for the System during theintermeeting period.  I will  need the ratification  of our domestic  operations,  and Iwould be  happy to answer any questions.2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  You raised  an issue  that I frankly  have not  thoughtabout in  a long time when you  referred to fog-induced  float. I remember years  ago thatthis  was  a relatively  usual occurrence.  That is,  weather-related  transportation  difficultiescaused float to fluctuate  sharply.  What  has been  the experience  in recent years?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  In the  last several  years,  I do not recall that many instances  ofsharp variations  in float.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is it technology that is  stabilizing float?  What ishappening?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Sandy  Krieger  says the weather  has been better!  [Laughter]Sharp, unanticipated  fluctuations  in float now  tend to happen  only with  extreme weather.The blizzards  we had a couple years  ago  that closed the city of New  York created  someextraordinary float  around the time  of the holidays.  The improvement  we have  seen  mayhave  been the result of technology  and a better working check  clearing process,  but I donot  have  any particular insights beyond  that.  My sense  over the last  six months to a year,however, is that we are  seeing a little  more variation in  float, and as  operating balancesget  lower and lower,  a given miss on  float proportionately  matters  a  lot more.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Rivlin  says  it is El Nino.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  The  improvement is due  to a lot of effort on the part of manypeople all around the Federal  Reserve  System.  They have  been dedicated  to reducingfloat from a  level that used to run in the range  of $2  to $3  billion  a day and is now  below$100  million  on most days.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  In other words,  we have float  down  too far to float!2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Right!  First of all,  we have  made  an enormous  number ofchanges  in the way we transport  checks and  other payment  instruments  and in thetimeliness with  which  we do it.  We have been  very careful  about  the time frames  inwhich we both  give credit  and transport  items from one place  to another.  If you comparewhat we do  currently to 1982,  we now deliver twice  as  many checks  in a single  day tolocations  across  the country as we did in  1982.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Don't smile, Peter, the next thing that  will come isa  slip of paper that says your salary has been reduced.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That is deflation!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Peter, one; the Chairman,  zero.  [Laughter]  Anyfurther questions?

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Peter, we took a fairly sizable  loss  on our foreign  exchangeholdings last year.  I know it was unrealized  and I know that in  some years we make aprofit on these holdings.  As I understand it, the unrealized loss  or profit does affect  theamount that we return to the Treasury  in any particular  year.  This may be  a dumbquestion, but is it at all feasible  to consider hedging  our exposure  in  some way?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  One could consider hedging  it, but I think the policy inference ofhow we choose to hedge  and how much we  hedge would be rather  awkward.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The act of hedging would be  an act of intervention.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  We don't  want to do that!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Once you hold the foreign  exchange, you intervene  when youhedge it.  It is as  if you had reversed the intervention  that occurred  when  you purchasedthe foreign exchange  to begin with.  Hedging is an  alternative to intervention,  and it has2/3-4/98been considered  on  occasion.  A  similar  question is whether  we  could  do all theintervention  in the  forward market or the nondeliverable  forward market.  I don't thinkthe  Manager would recommend  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Not yet!  If I may, President  Broaddus,  you mentioned unrealizedlosses or profits.  We pass our net profits on continuously to the Treasury.  They gothrough the P&L  system and on to the Treasury throughout  the year.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  I think that is a very  important point.  Although our unrealizedprofits  or losses get  announced  once  in the summary report  for the year  and therefore  thatis  a big number, I think the policy that we have followed  for some  time now is to forwardour net earnings  to the Treasury every  week, if I am not mistaken.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That is a new  policy?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  No, it has been  in existence  for some years.  The fact that wemake  payments to the  Treasury periodically through  the year  does reduce the politicaldimension  of this.  In some foreign  countries  such  as  Germany, the  central  bank makes  apayment  once  a year and the  size  and timing  in and of itself is  a political event.  Leavingaside the  comments  that you made, which  are perfectly  reasonable,  the  fact that it is doneroutinely  in bits and  pieces  as  the foreign  exchange  value of the dollar rises and fallsmeans that we essentially  cushion it in terms  of the political impact.  Perhaps  to furtherlower the  impact we  should not report it only in the  annual  statement.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I move  approval  of thedomestic  operations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Hold on.  Some of your colleagues  may have  morequestions.2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I was looking  around  and didn't see any.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I will presume  you  are correct.  Is there  a second?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  I will second it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  We now move on to the ChartShow with Mike  Prell  and Karen  Johnson.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We will be referring to the charts inthis colorful  handout  in front of you.  2/Chart  1 summarizes  the staff forecast.  I  should note that here, as in  the otherexhibits,  we have used the Greenbook numbers  for GDP-related  variables  ratherthan those  in the  BEA's advance release.  We have done this partly for mechanicalreasons but also with the thought that the  differences  are for the most part smalland mainly matters  of forecasting  missing source data.  Time will tell  whoseestimate  is closer to the  mark--though  it makes  me a bit uneasy  knowing that theyare the  umpire as well  as  a contestant in  this guessing  game.In  any event,  on either set of numbers,  we would be predicting a  sharpthat real GDP growth  will  slow to about  1  percent this year and pick up to just 2percent next  year.  We expect the growth  of private domestic  final  demand, thered line on this chart,  to fall  off but not so  sharply; in fact, we  are expecting  anadvance  of almost 4 percent this year.  The story  behind the near-term  drop-off  inoverall  GDP growth is  inventories  and  the external  sector, as  we  will  bediscussing  shortly.The projected  growth  of output is slower than potential,  and thus we  anticipatean easing of pressures  on  resources.  The middle panels  show that theunemployment  rate  is predicted to rise to  5-1/4  percent by late  1999, while thefactory utilization  rate  is expected to drop  to 78-1/2  percent.This  continues the recent pattern of disparate messages  from the  twoutilization  measures,  with the jobless  rate remaining  so low that we  wouldnormally expect inflation  to pick up by  a few tenths  of a percent per year,  whilethe  capacity utilization  rate  is below  par historically  and seemingly  pointing tofurther disinflation.  The forecast in  the bottom  panels  essentially splits  the2/ Copies  of the charts  used by Mr. Prell and Ms.  Johnson  are appended to the transcript.(Appendix  2)2/3-4/98difference,  while  also taking account  of the other elements  in the inflation  picture.The core  CPI inflation rate edges off slightly through  1999,  while  the overallindex  slows further this  year and then accelerates  discernibly next year.  At least,that is what we foresee  for the published  data, a distinction I will return to later.Meanwhile,  Chart 2 outlines  the key financial  and fiscal features  in theoutlook. First, our basic  monetary policy assumption  is that the  fed funds rate willremain  near the present  5-1/2 percent  level.  As you can  see in the upper left graph,the real  funds rate has been rising  in recent quarters  owing to the quarter-pointsnugging  last March  and a decline  in inflation  expectations--proxied  herealternatively  by lagging  one-year PCE inflation  and the  Michigan SRC  surveymedian.  We anticipate  that  this real rate will remain  at a relatively  elevated levelover the forecast  period.We also  expect that long-term rates will  stay pretty much in  the range ofrecent weeks.  This implies  the persistence  of an unusually  flat yield curve, asdepicted  in the upper right panel.  Historically,  so  narrow  a spread between  longand  short rates would appear to point to very weak  GDP growth.  However, thisnarrowing  has occurred  in an unusual  way.  Most commonly  in the past, thenarrowing of the  spread occurred  with Fed tightenings  causing short rates to risemore  than long rates.  In this instance,  though,  policy  action  has been  a minorfactor, and the long rate  has been  influenced by, among other things,  a flight tosafety, diminished inflation  expectations,  and the prospect  of federal  surpluses.One thing is clear, though:  whereas a year or so  ago the  markets  evidently thoughtthe Fed would have  to tighten to keep  inflation  from rising, that is no longer thecase.  What to take  from that observation  is not entirely clear,  but I would offerthe speculation that it is not so much a reflection  of a view  that the economy  isgoing to weaken drastically  as  it is an indication  of the belief that favorable  supplyconditions-- including  strong productivity  gains and the  availability  of cheapimports--will be restraining price increases  as the economy  expands moderately.The ability of the stock  market to achieve new highs in the face of the recentAsian storms  would seem to support this upbeat interpretation  of the yield curvedevelopments.  But,  we believe  that  the market will  decline about  10 percent fromyesterday's  record level by the end of this year.  The key reason is the divergencebetween our forecast  of profits  and those  apparently prevailing  in the markettoday.  The red line  in the lower  left panel of Chart 2 shows  that stock  marketstrategists--the  so-called  "top-down"  analysts--are  expecting  S&P  500 earningsper share  to grow roughly 6-1/2  percent this year and  51/2 next.  The "bottom-up"summation  of individual-company  security analysts'  views,  not plotted here, isstill well  into double  digits.  The black  line shows  our forecast  of a NIPA itemthat has  tracked the S&P earnings  relatively closely in recent years;  as  you  cansee, we are  more pessimistic  about the outlook.  It is  obvious to  which  drummerthe market has been  marching in the past few  days; and there  is a clear  danger thatthis rally will provide  additional  stimulus  to  aggregate  demand.  The Greenbook2/3-4/98provided  a simulation  of a more  buoyant  stock market  for those of you skepticalof our predictive powers,  which  I assume is  many of you at this point.Finally, on the  fiscal  side, we have  assumed  that there will be no significantnet changes  in policy in  the near term.  The  unified budget is projected to be  inapproximate  balance in  fiscal  1998  and  1999.As I  suggested earlier,  a good  deal of the action  in our forecast has its roots  inthe external  sector, so  let me turn  now to Karen,  who will  discuss  that part of theoutlook.

MS. JOHNSON.  Financial  market turbulence  in Asia has dominated eventsabroad  over the past six months.  We have attempted  to foresee  how these eventswill influence prices,  global  trade, and thus output growth  both here and abroadduring this year and next.  Despite our best efforts, uncertainty  about exactly howthese variables  are linked and about how the key financial  variables  will behave inthe near term is a major source of risk to our forecast.Your first international  chart reports  interest rate changes  and developments  inexchange  markets,  along  with our forecasts  for  selected dollar exchange  rates.The top left panel  shows the change in the value  of the dollar in  terms of the yenand the mark since  mid-1997.  We believe that the relative  strength of economicactivity in the United States  accounted  for much of the rise in the value  of thedollar over the year.  Dollar assets  also provided  some security in a turbulentworld.  With U.S.  output growth expected to slow,  and given  our assumption  thatthe crises in Asia will not give rise to additional major surprises  in that region  orelsewhere,  we look for the dollar to remain  near recent levels  in terms of thesecurrencies.  In terms of the Canadian dollar, on the right panel,  we look for theU.S. dollar to retreat a bit from recent  all-time  highs.  We expect the dollar to riseslightly in terms of sterling,  which has been particularly  strong recently.As is shown  in the next row  of panels, three-month  interest  rates have movedup since July in  foreign industrial countries,  particularly in Canada and the UnitedKingdom, where official  central bank lending rates have been  increased.  Ten-yearrates  have generally fallen,  however.  On  balance,  long-term  rates  have moveddown  less in Germany  and Japan than in the United  States, perhaps reflectingcapital flowing  into U.S.  instruments  in  search of safe-haven opportunities.The next panels  show  a range  of selected  Asian currencies,  expressed  as theU.S.  dollar value  of those  currencies.  In  nominal  terms, the Hong Kong dollar hasto date successfully  maintained its peg  to the U.S.  dollar, and we project that willcontinue.  The  Korean won and the Thai baht  have lost  about one  half of theirlarger.  There  undoubtedly will  be more volatility in  these nominal exchange  rates.But,  as  shown  on the right, on balance  over the forecast period we  expect that2/3-4/98rising domestic  inflation  will impart  an upward trend to the real  exchange rates  ofthe heavily  depreciated Asian  currencies.  For the Mexican  peso, bottom left,slowing domestic  inflation  and some nominal  depreciation  should prevent furtherreal appreciation.A broad  measure of the exchange  value  of the  dollar in terms of 29 currencies--weighted  to reflect the  competitiveness  of U.S. exports  and  adjusted for relativeconsumer prices--is  shown in the bottom right panel.  Taken together, ourprojections for dollar exchange rates  imply that, for this measure of the dollar, theextended  real  appreciation that began in early  1995  will give way to some  modestreal depreciation  of the dollar.Your next chart translates  our outlook for exchange  rates  and foreign pricesinto prospects  for U.S. import prices.  The  top left panel presents  what evidencewe have  of the effect  to date on U.S.  import prices of the events in Asia.  Prices ofimports  from the Asian  NIEs and from  Japan continued to fall rapidly through thefourth quarter, in  contrast to prices  of imports from other industrial  countries.The  right panel  shows  some results  of our efforts  to use models to calculatethe contribution  of foreign  consumer prices  and exchange rates to  average  U.S.import prices.  Our research  shows that  it is useful to separate prices  in the foreignindustrial  countries--translated  into dollars using nominal  exchange rates  (theblack line)--from  prices  in the nonindustrial  countries,  also expressed  in dollars(the red line).  The  very sharp declines in the exchange rates  of many countries inthe latter group result in the much steeper drop during  1997 that is evident in thered line.  In addition,  in our analysis of import prices, we need to allow forimpulses from non-oil commodity prices  (in the middle left panel) and  oil prices(the middle right panel).  Non-oil  commodity prices  are expected to continue theirdownward  trend throughout the forecast period  as supplies of these commoditiesgenerally remain  ample  and as economic  distress in Asia weakens  global  demand.Oil prices have  already decreased  significantly  and are  expected to edge  down abit further before  partly retracing  their decline.  The present softness  in  oil marketsreflects  additional oil supply from some Persian  Gulf producers  and mild winterweather in several regions that has depressed demand.The bottom panel reports results  of our efforts  to take account  of these factorsin forecasting the prices  of core imports--that is, imports of non-oil  goods otherthan computers  and semiconductors,  shown by the  black line--and prices of totalimports of goods  and services,  the red line.  The  solid black bars  show themodel's calculation  of the contribution  of prices  in foreign industrial  countries  tothe  forecast for core import  prices; the  open black  bars do the same for prices ofthe nonindustrial  countries.  Our analysis  suggests that the extreme  depreciationsin  some Asian currencies  were  an important  influence  in the decline  of importprices  late in  1997  and will continue so in  early 1998.  However, our estimatessuggest that  the effect of a given  percentage  change in  dollar prices  in the2/3-4/98nonindustrial  countries  on U.S. import prices  is  about one third of the effect of thesame  change in  prices in foreign  industrial  countries.  Thus, the disinflationaryimpact of price  developments  in  Asia on U.S.  import  prices  is limited.  Pricesfrom both groups  of countries  are  projected to switch  to exerting  slight  upwardpressure later this year.Our outlook for output abroad, the subject  of your next chart,  incorporates  ourjudgment  about the implications  of financial  developments  in Asia for activity inthat region  and our estimate of the spillover effects of those  developments  ontogrowth  in other regions.  Growth  abroad,  the red bars in the top left panel, isestimated  to have  dropped  sharply in the  fourth quarter  and is projected  to remainweak this year before recovering partially next  year.  As  can be  seen in  the topright panel,  swings in projected  growth in  the Asian developing  countries accountfor the lion's share  of the fall in average  growth  abroad.  Growth  in the LatinAmerican  developing countries  and in the  industrial  countries is  expected to beweaker  this year and next than in  1997, in  part the result  of spillovers  from eventsin Asia.As reported in the middle left panel, the Asian developing  countries  accountfor nearly 20 percent  of U.S. exports.  Our reading of developments  to  date is thatoutput growth  in Korea and in  several  southeast  Asian countries will be pushedinto negative  numbers  as  domestic demand  is  severely reduced by the  financialmacroeconomic  policy measures  put in place in  these countries.  We look forrecovery to begin  in 1999 in  response to strong external  demand and success onbalance  in implementing the structural  reforms  now  under way.  In "greaterChina,"  some asset market  disruption and loss of export competitiveness  as  aconsequence  of currency  depreciations by neighbors is expected to weaken  growththis  year  and to restrain the rebound next year.This forecast incorporates  the substantial  improvement  in external  balances  inAsia that we believe global  financial  markets  are  demanding.  The bottom leftpanel compares  our forecast  for the aggregate current  account balances  of theAsian region  in the  current Greenbook (the black  bars) with that prepared inone or two smaller  Asian countries.  We now estimate  that the aggregate  Asianexternal  balance for  1997  already  has adjusted  significantly.  Substantial furtheradjustment  is expected to be accomplished  quickly during this year; theemergence  of sizable  surpluses  should reassure  markets, thereby easing creditavailability  and permitting moderation  of some policy measures.  Growth  indomestic  demand  should then resume.  You can see  in the right panel for the LatinAmerican  countries that only a small  positive revision has been made to ourforecast since  September.  This  aggregate  masks substantial  changes  since2/3-4/98assuming that these  countries will  not experience  the kind of financial crises thatwould force substantial  external  adjustment.Chart 6 contains  our forecast  for the industrial countries  and some  of thefactors that  lie behind it.  Real  GDP growth  in most of these countries,  the top leftbox, is expected  to slow  this year, in part as  a consequence of weaker exportdemand from  Asia.  In Japan,  large direct effects  of downturns  in the troubledAsian countries  came  on top of domestic  factors that weakened domestic  demandand the result was little growth  on balance  last year.  We expect  only limitedrecovery during the  forecast period as  the move from fiscal  contraction  to a moreneutral  stance yields  a bounceback in  domestic demand that is partially offset byweakness in the external  sector.  The panel on the right shows  measures  of the yenand the mark calculated  as weighted averages based on their exports  and adjustedfor relative consumer prices.  These measures  suggest that, in effective  terms,these currencies  appreciated  in  1997--with the yen moving  further over the year asa whole.  This effective  appreciation  should act as a drag on the external  sector formuch of the forecast  period.  Our exchange rate projections  imply some realeffective  depreciation  this year and next, especially for the  yen,  that should help toboost the Japanese  and German economies  in  1999.The extent to which the other industrial  countries are  vulnerable to spillovereffects from Asia is suggested  by the data in the middle panel.  While Japanexports a fraction  of its GDP similar  to that for the United States,  a far largershare  of its exports  has been to  the Asian developing countries.  The EuropeanUnion  members,  when  taken together so that intra-EU trade is excluded, closelyresemble  the United States.The bottom panels  show the  available information  on  business  confidence.The downturns  evident for the Canadian,  U.K.,  and Japanese measures  in  thesecond  half of 1997  likely are at least in part a response to the  Asian crises.  In theEuropean  countries  shown on the right panel, business confidence  leveled off inlate  1997.  In  France, where we have  a reading from January, confidence  remainedat a high level but there were some reports  of lower foreign orders,  perhaps  a hintof Asian  effects  to come.The final international  chart presents  our conclusions  about the path of real  netexports over the  forecast  period.  The black line in  the upper left panel,  projectedgrowth  of core imports--the volume  of non-oil goods  excluding  computers andsemiconductors  --is  shown  slowing on a four-quarter  change basis through  the endof 1999.  Our models decompose  the contributions  of U.S.  GDP (the black bars)and relative prices  (the red bars).  Through part of 1998,  the stimulative  effect ofthe recent dollar appreciation  increasingly boosts import demand,  partly offsettingthe restraining effect of slower U.S.  GDP growth.  From mid-1998  throughmid-1999  both variables  are  working to  decelerate core  imports.2/3-4/98In the  upper right panel,  projected  growth  of real  core  exports--the  line--dropssharply,  starting  now.  Relative prices  are  working to cause exports  to declinethroughout  the forecast  period.  The robust  contribution  of foreign  growth  to ourexport performance  that occurred in  1997  is projected to be  followed bysignificantly diminished  contributions  this year  and next.Growth  of total exports  and imports  is  depicted in the lower left panel.  As  youcan  see, the slowing  that we expect  in export  growth--the  black line--greatlyexceeds  that projected  for imports--the  red line--a consequence  of the real  dollarappreciation  that we have  seen.  In addition,  we have  not extrapolated  into theforecast period the surprising  strength in real  export growth  that occurred in thefirst half of 1997--the  part not  explained  by the bars in the upper right panel.With real  imports  growing  significantly faster than exports throughout  the forecastperiod, the contribution  of real  net exports is negative.  As  the data in  the boxshow, real net exports likely will  subtract nearly one  percentage  point from realGDP growth this year  and about  half that in  1999.Mike will  now  continue our presentation.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  The  next two charts  focus on the  dynamics  of private  demand inthe forecast.  First, in  Chart 8, the upper  left panel shows  real PCE growth  holdingat a high rate  for a while  longer and then  dropping  off to 2 percent in  1999.  Allsigns look positive for consumer spending  in the short run, among  them thehistorically high  level of sentiment portrayed  at the  right.  Surely,  one of thefactors  accounting for these favorable  attitudes  is the run-up  in stock  marketwealth.As  I noted earlier,  we are expecting the market  to give back a small  share ofits gain,  causing the wealth-income  ratio to fall  off--as  shown by the black  line inthe middle  left panel.  The experience  of the past year  has reinforced our belief inthe significance  of the wealth  effect  on consumption;  thus, we are  predicting thatthe personal  saving rate will  drop further over the next few quarters  in laggedresponse to last year's  market  advance and  then  level out in  1999.An added attraction  in  the story of strong consumer demand is  the currentwave of mortgage  refinancing.  The run-up in the  MBA refinancing  applicationsseries,  plotted at the right, probably exaggerates  the relative  dimension  of theinterest  savings that will  be  realized by households  in this  episode,  but thereshould be  enough to give  a  small lift to spending.  The decline  in mortgage  ratesobviously has made  home purchase  more  affordable.  As  documented  at thelower left, our usual measure of the cash  flow burden of ownership  shows that, bythis  criterion,  now  is the best time in  decades  for the average  family to buy  ahouse.  In our forecast,  this remains  so, and--with  little supply of unsold new unitsoverhanging  the market--we  see  single-family housing  starts holding  up wellthrough next year,  despite  the slowing of job growth.  A  very close inspection of2/3-4/98the right panel,  perhaps requiring  a magnifying glass,  shows that  multifamilystarts--the  reddish upper  layer--spurted  in the fourth  quarter of 1997.  We do notexpect  that higher level  to  be sustained--although  there  may be  some upside  riskhere,  given the generous  availability  of financing  for developers.  The bottom lineis that residential  investment,  which  rose substantially  in  1997,  is likely to flattenout soon  and then  edge lower.Softening export and consumer  demand will tend to cause businesses  to trimtheir capital  spending programs  over the coming months--the  so-called acceleratoreffects.  The upper left panel of Chart 9 shows  that through  some large  quarterlygyrations indicated by the red line, real business fixed investment  remained  on astrong growth trend last year.  We  foresee  a notable  slowing but not a collapse.Indeed,  as indicated at the right, we estimate that the level  of spending will  sustainthe recent  3 percent-plus  growth  of the business  capital  stock  through the next twoyears.This is high  enough to produce  further sizable  increases  in the amount ofcapital per worker.  Among  the forces spurring this capital deepening  is the rapidcombination  of further  price reductions  and increasing power should  be enough  tokeep real  computer purchases  on  a steep  growth  trajectory.Orders for nondefense  capital goods,  ex aircraft,  shown  at the right, havewaffled  a bit in recent  months, but from what  we hear, we do not think this is amajor turning point in  domestic equipment spending.  I might  note that, in thenear term, this  series will  have to be read with extra  caution when  gauging thestrength  of domestic purchases.  International  trade is very important in  thissector, and by all reports--and  perhaps  reflected in yesterday's  NAPM survey--equipment  orders  from Asia have begun to weaken.  Likewise,  at  some point, U.S.firms  may find some  bargains in  imported capital  goods,  although this  is  likely tobe a lesser part of the story and more  concentrated  in computers.Another key element  in the projected economic  deceleration  this year  isinventories.  Nonfarm  stocks rose  around 5  percent  last year,  clearly  anunsustainable  rate.  We are expecting  a deceleration  over the  next few quarters toroughly 2 percent.  Admittedly,  we have been  telling this  story for some time.Perhaps,  however,  the risk of another upside  surprise has been diminished by therise  of the  stock-sales  ratio that  you can  see in the  right panel.  In retrospect, itlooks  like firms  found themselves  with  leaner-than-desired  inventories  at the endof last year and have been restocking--with  the  added ingredient  of the Boeingproduction  ramp-up.  Of course,  with no broad overhang  of unwanted stocks  atthis point, any  upside surprise  in final  demand  relative  to our forecast could againbe reinforced  by an inventory response.2/3-4/98Let me turn now  to the  question  of the  implications  of the projected  growth  forinflationary  pressures.  Chart  10  shows some  key features  of our labor marketforecast.  In the upper panel,  you  can  see that we expect  a slowing  of laborproductivity  growth in  the near  term and  then a return  to roughly  trend growth  in1999.  As we noted in  the Greenbook,  a number  of considerations  came into playin this  forecast, but central  is that there  will be  some  lag in the adjustment  ofhours  and employment to the  slowing of output growth.Certainly, at this point there is no sign  of a major  slackening in hiring.  Initialclaims and a variety of other indicators  suggest  that the January and Februarylabor market reports  will  show  still sizable  increases  in payrolls--albeit  not on thescale of those  reported for the fourth  quarter.  But we expect firms  to respondbefore  long to the evidence of softening  demand,  and--as  you can see  at themiddle  left--we  are  looking for monthly payroll  increases  to drop below  100,000this spring.On the other  side of the ledger, we  do not foresee  any significant  movementsin the labor force participation  rate.  A reduced  growth  in job opportunities willtempt fewer people to  enter the  labor market,  balancing off a modest positiveeffect of welfare reform.On balance,  as I noted  earlier this all  results  in  a rise in  the unemploymentrate, but not to what  we  would regard  as implying  the absence  of wage  pressures.The latest ECI release  showed a big jump in compensation  in the fourth quarter,which  we  are discounting heavily in  our assessment  of ongoing  trends.  First, wealways  downplay the quarterly numbers  because they are  so noisy;  but, second, inthe present case they seem to have been  importantly  influenced  by a fewnon-recurrent  industry developments  and the  minimum wage hike.  That said, wedo  believe that  the tightness  of the labor market  gave an  underlying lift to thetrend of compensation  gains last year, especially  on the wage  side.  Our forecast,however,  is that  wage increases  will  diminish  slightly this  year  and next, owing  tothe lagged effects  of falling price inflation  and inflation  expectations.  Meanwhile,benefit cost increases  are  expected to be  a little larger, owing primarily to risinghealth  insurance  premiums.  The net outcome, tabulated  at the right,  is a slightdrop-back  in  compensation  inflation to just over 3 percent  by  1999.If one viewed  prices  as  being determined  in the short run  by a mark-up  overtrend unit  labor costs,  this might suggest  a  pretty sanguine  outlook for priceinflation.  An  alternative  view,  though,  is that the more reliable  modelingapproach  is to link price inflation  directly to resource  utilization,  letting  wages  andthe share  of income going to labor be a side show.  But, in implementing  thislatter formulation,  one must choose  a measure of resource  utilization.Traditionally,  it has been  the unemployment  rate, but it is far from  clear whatreally works best.2/3-4/98The upper panels of Chart  11  illustrate this  quandary.  On the  left side is  ascatter plot of the unemployment  rate versus changes  in CPI inflation;  on the rightis the corresponding  plot for the manufacturing  capacity utilization rate.  As youreye will  tell you and the cited R-squares  will  confirm, there isn't much to choosebetween the two versions.  That is because  the jobless rate  and the capacityutilization rate  generally have  moved together.  But that has not been so true oflate;  capacity has been  growing  very rapidly in  manufacturing,  and the factoryutilization  rate has been  only a  bit above  average  in the  past year while theunemployment  rate  has fallen  to quite  a low level  by past standards.  Reflectingthis,  the inflation forecasting  "error"  in  1997,  as measured  by the vertical  distanceto the regression  line,  was smaller  for the utilization  rate than for theunemployment rate  relation.We  do not want to make too  much  of this  observation.  First, these clearly  areloose relationships  historically.  And second, we have  yet to develop a compellingstory for why plant use would systematically  be  pivotal  in the overall inflationprocess.  Under the  circumstances,  our forecast  involves  what we hope  is ajudicious  weighting of the signals coming from  the two indicators  of inflationarypressure.  Certainly,  at this juncture, despite the tightness of the labor markets,there  is no anecdotal  support for the notion that prices are  about to firm; indeed, ingoods markets,  prices may  well  decline  in the near term.  The competition  fromcheaper imports  obviously  is a factor there.Also pointing to a lower inflation  outlook this year  than might be suggested bythe  unemployment  rate alone is the likelihood that  food prices  will increaserelatively  slowly--the middle  left panel--and the favorable  consequences  of the oilcost developments  that Karen  described  for consumer energy prices--the rightpanel.  In both  instances, however,  we are looking  for some pickup in  1999.The bottom  panel  summarizes  once again  our projection  for total and core CPIinflation,  the value-added  in this  version being  the addition of the effects  of thetechnical changes  in the index  made  by the BLS  since  1994.  As you  can see, thetrend of inflation--as  indicated by the total height  of the bars--is somewhat  lessfavorable  when  viewed from this perspective,  but the acceleration  in  prices still isnot dramatic.  From where we were  last year, the pickup by  1999 is only on theorder of a quarter percentage  point in  the core  CPI;  even measured  on  a basisconsistent  with the  1994 figures, core  and total CPI inflation  would still be lessthan 3  percent next year.  As  the Bluebook simulations  suggested,  a plausibleextension  of the  Greenbook baseline  might  show inflation  trending up still furtherafter  1999,  in the absence  of some policy action,  but perhaps only a moderate  one.Under the circumstances,  and  with all the uncertainties  in the  outlook, we did notthink it unreasonable  to stick with a  stable  funds  rate assumption  in formulatingthis projection.2/3-4/98The final exhibit  summarizes the  forecasts  you submitted.  You folksgenerally are predicting  stronger growth  and higher inflation,  but with anunemployment  rate similar to ours.  It is tempting to enter into some mind-readingabout  what might lie behind the different  behavioral relationship,  but I expect thatthis will become  apparent in the  discussion.  I might  also note that  in theHumphrey-Hawkins  report, the Board is  effectively required  to comment  on theconsistency of your forecasts  with those  of the Administration;  their CPI forecastis at the high  end of the central  tendency range  I have constructed  for you, whiletheir growth  rate is at the  low end  and their unemployment  rate above yours.I will stop here; we will be  happy to answer whatever questions  we  can.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me say first that as is usually our procedure,  wewill allow the forecasts  that you  submitted to Mike  Prell to be subject to revision  until theclose of business  on Monday, February 9.  Questions?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mike,  I want to ask a question  related to your confidence in theconsistency of the financial  and the real  forecasts. I would like to get  Peter's reactionfrom the market's  standpoint and from the Desk's as well.  Looking  at Chart  1, Chart 2,and the Greenbook numbers,  let us imagine that  six months  from now, maybe  at theFOMC  meeting in August,  these projections  have been  borne  out by the data reported forthe first two quarters.  In that event, we would be looking at real GDP growth of 1 percentfor the second quarter and an  average rate of inflation,  as measured  by the CPI, of 1.1percent  for the first half.  Bond yields  would be  about the  same or higher than  they aretoday.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Let me  say that in  our forecast we  anticipated that a  considerableproportion of market  participants would  be expecting us to ease  in that economicenvironment.  So, we actually  have  long rates  coming down from their current levels.  Weindicated in  the Greenbook  that  they probably would go down  to their recent lows andpossibly through  them.  We think the incoming  news in  the  next few  months is going to2/3-4/98create  a much  more  bullish  atmosphere  in the intermediate-  and long-term  sectors  of the

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  In my presentation,  I pointed to the possibility that bullishsentiment is already  building in the market.  This is one of the anxieties  that I have inlooking at the market.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It is not uncommon  to find forecasts that indicate  a little morestrength in the bond market than ours does over coming months.  Those forecasts  areassociated  with predictions  of 30-year Treasury  rates in the area of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2  percent, andthere are  those who are  looking for a rate of 5 percent in the not too distant future.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  The question  was  really about confidence  in the consistency  ofthe two sets of data, the national  income and product account numbers  and the  financial.When  I look at  the Blue Chip forecast,  for instance, it is not clear to me to what extentsuch  a forecast is  already built into the current  market.  If this Greenbook projection  isalready close  to being built into current markets,  that is  one thing--

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think our economic  forecast  is weaker than most of those  in theChip consensus  looks more  like your forecasts  at this juncture, and it appears to beassociated with essentially  stable short-term  rates.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  How  much of an error in the Greenbook projections  for the nexttwo quarters,  the  current quarter and spring quarter, would be required before  we had  asignificant backup in market interest rates?  To what extent  does  the market in this  sense2/3-4/98need to see  something close to this kind of projection to hold these levels versus  asurprise in the other direction?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Peter may have greater insight into this than I, given  his proximityto  more market participants.  I guess my sense is that real  growth alone is not going  to bethe critical variable.  I think a more crucial  factor will  be  signs that inflation is  picking upin a way that would be  perceived  as making the Fed very nervous.  If this were anenvironment  in which  we did not see  signs of the Asian  shock feeding through, I thinkthat  would make markets all  the more anxious because  developments  in Asia are  seenright now as  balancing out, in the Fed's  eyes, the  high level  of resource  utilization  and theinflation  risk that that entails.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  I was going to comment  that over the last couple of months inparticular the markets  seem to have had a weaker picture  of the outlook for economicgrowth  and inflation  than many economists.  The markets seem  to be building in  a softerpath for short-term rates,  even  making the  allowances that Peter mentioned,  than havemost economists.  So, it is very hard to tell  what would be a disappointment  and whatwould not.  The other point, just to reinforce what Mike said, is that expectations  relatingto the economic  outlook seem  to have a  lot to do with the timing of the Asian effects  onthe U.S. economy.  The question  is not whether they will hit shortly but whether theprove to be  a little  stronger than expected  would not have much effect  on markets  ifSo, I think we have  to look past the first half to see how  markets would react.2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  I was  asking  the question because  headline  reports about  theAsian  situation  give one the impression that these  economies  are even  bigger thanCalifornia's  economy, let alone  Canada's,  which, of course, is not true.  All of them takentogether  are not that large  in terms of their aggregate GDP, total trade, or shares  of ourtrade.  Yet, one gets  the impression  from the press reports that a very, very big  downdrafteffect is about to hit us.  If such an effect  is built into  the marketplace,  we could get  asignificant  backup in rates  when the markets find out that it is not true.Let me ask a  somewhat  related question since  you mentioned possible  reactions  tosigns of rising  inflation,  should they emerge. In  one of the panels  on Chart 8,  Mike, youillustrated the strength of the  housing markets  by showing multifamily  and single-familyhousing starts, but you  did not show house prices.  Do you have  any implicit or explicitforecast of what you think is  going to happen  to residential  house prices?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Yes.  But I must say that exactly what has been  happening to houseprices  is a  little unclear.  By most measures  such prices have  been rising somewhat fasterthan the general  inflation rate.  The rise  varies  from measure  to measure and  seeminglymonth to month, but I think there has been  a real increase.  We anticipate a further realincrease  over  1998 and  1999,  something in the  3 to 4 percent range for single-familyhouses.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike, I have  a question  about the ECI forecast. I understand yourpoint about the fourth quarter of last year.  If we look at the trend  of the ECI in  yourforecast from the  second quarter of last year to the first  quarter of  1999,  it seems unlikelyto me that  we are going to continue to experience  such  a favorable  trend.  First, it seems2/3-4/98to me that increases  in  medical  costs are  likely to be  accelerating,  and if that occurs yourforecast  would imply slower increases  in  the wage and  salary component  of the ECI.Secondly, I think  that bonuses  and commissions,  which  clearly played a major role inboosting the ECI in  the fourth  quarter of last year, may continue  to play such  a role  in thecurrent quarter and maybe beyond.  That  seems likely for real  estate commissions  inparticular.  I do not know  how the BLS  handles the seasonal  adjustment  of bonuses,which sometimes  are paid at the beginning  of the year for tax reasons  as  opposed to theend of the  year.  I also  think that inflation  expectations  could be a major factor, but howthose are  actually formulated  may be  more complex  because  we anticipate improvementin the core  CPI due  to technical factors.  To the extent  that people  are looking  at what ishappening to actual prices,  those factors  may not be  seen.  So, I guess I end up thinkingthat this is one area where I have  the  greatest uncertainty.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I don't know  if it is the area in  which we have our greatestuncertainty,  but I would certainly  agree there  is uncertainty  attending this part of theforecast.  It probably is unwise to put too much weight on the quarterly  progression ofthese compensation  numbers.  We have  found them  to be extremely  erratic  and theseasonal adjustment  of this series is uncertain.  I think the best way to look at thesenumbers is  on some moving average basis.  We took a look at them  on a four-quarterchange basis, and we saw  an acceleration  over the past four quarters,  but it was  only onthe order of about 1/4 percentage  point.  That included  the effects of a considerable  boostto the fourth quarter from  commissions  and bonuses.  The surge in  the latter wasassociated with the high level  of activity in the  real  estate and  mortgage banking  business,and it does not necessarily imply ongoing rapid growth  from that high level.  We also had2/3-4/98a minimum  wage  increase  that probably  affected  the fourth quarter to  some  extent on alagged  basis.  But when we look at  the ECI components  by industry and  so  on, there is nobroad,  across-the-board  acceleration  that one  can observe.  So, I think it is reasonable  totake those  recent  numbers with  a grain of salt.  They are  affected to an  important  extentby the finance,  insurance,  and  real estate sectors,  and they may  also be capturing  some  ofwhat we have  been hearing  about  temp workers and computer  people.  When  we getbeyond that, we do not  see much  going on.In the  first quarter, yes,  we expect  another  slug of bonuses.  That is  apparentlywhen the majority of the Wall  Street  firms will  be paying them out,  so we have  them inour numbers.  That tends  to keep the first-quarter  benefits number from dropping back asit might otherwise,  given the  fourth-quarter  bulge.  The really big  issue  going forward, Ithink, is the inflation  expectations  story.  Now,  there  are different ways that people modelthe momentum  in compensation.  Some look at  wages as the  momentum  variable.  If wedid that, we would forecast  an acceleration.  Depending  on which  compensation  variableis selected, it could be a  slight acceleration  or one that  is considerable.An  alternative  view is  to look at price  expectations,  and we have models  that dothat.  It is not  clear which  model works best, but the ones that incorporate  priceexpectations  are predicting much  slower  inflation in  compensation than we have  writtendown.  If we  take the latest Michigan reading  as our measure  of current  inflationexpectations,  there seems to be some movement  of these expectations  into closeralignment  with the actual inflation rate over  the past year.  When employers  sit down  toconsider  what kind of pay increases  they may  grant their employees,  to the extent thatthey take the  cost of living into  consideration  they will  be looking  back at 2 percent2/3-4/98inflation,  maybe  a bit less.  Some of our models  are  using lagged inflation  terms that havehigher inflation  expectations  implicit in  them.  So,  we  see this as a balancing  act.  We donot know which  is the optimal formulation  to use, but we think we have  a reasonableprojection  to work with at this point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  How  significant is the correlation  between  nominalcompensation  and productivity?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't know  the answer to that question,  but I suspect thecorrelation  is very weak in the  short run.  In fact, we get some of our largestcompensation  increases when  productivity  increases  are beginning to fall near the end ofa cyclical  expansion.  But I would not venture  a further statement  on that.

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  One can put nonfarm  business productivity  into a wageequation and actually see  whether  or not productivity  is  an important factor explainingnominal wage  gains.  The statistical  effect turns  out to be  marginally significant  at best.We know  that real  wage aspirations,  loosely based on productivity, ought to be animportant factor in  conditioning wage  demands,  but businesses  may not be willing togrant the wage  increases.  To the extent that fluctuations in productivity  do not  show upin wages,  the first round effects will show through  to profit margins rather than nominalcompensation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The reason I raise  the question  is actually  thereverse;  it relates to anecdotal  indications that when nominal  wages  are beginning  toaccelerate,  then business escalates  its efforts to reduce  costs and improve productivity.So,  if that model were functioning  in  a meaningful  sense, then a significant rise  innominal  wages could  very well merely reflect the fact that productivity  was rising and2/3-4/98therefore  unit labor costs were not.  But when  you try to put that into the equation, youare telling me that you  are picking  up almost nothing.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Some  of this has been  touched  on  in the  simulations  of the effectsof a productivity surprise  that we have discussed in the  past and how  it might feedthrough  to wages,  profits,  and  prices in  a short-run  dynamic.  One of the things  thatpresumably  happened  in the fourth quarter is that people  working in mortgage  bankingfirms and  in some other finance  and real  estate areas  probably were more productive,  andthey got larger commissions.  So, there was  a direct link between  compensation  andproduction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mike, I think you mentioned beforethat the Greenbook forecast  is at the low end  of a lot of outside forecasts,  including thelow end of the Blue Chip range  in particular.  You also mentioned that it was a littlelower than most of our forecasts  here.  Obviously, the  two things that are driving yourforecast  are net exports  and the  swing in inventories.  As I look  at other forecasts,particularly on the export  side, you  seem to be  an outlier in terms  of the growth  inexports.  Have you done  any testing to see what the effect on  your overall forecast  wouldbe  if, instead of a growth rate of 0.6 percent in exports,  you assumed a  higher rate, say,  1,2, or 3 percent?

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  I don't have  a precise  numerical  answer to that question.  If wewere to generate  higher export  growth in  our model by exogenously  stronger  incomegrowth  abroad, then we  would go through  a process involving certain  interactions whoseresult  would be to produce  a net positive  impact on  U.S.  GDP.2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  The effect  on GDP would be 0.2 percentage  point, I think.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  A couple of tenths?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Yes.  Exports  are  10  percent of GDP.  When  they grow 2percent faster,  I think the  answer would be 0.2 percent,  roughly.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  That implies a  multiplier of 1.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  The multiplier might be  as high  as  112.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  Yes,  1 to 1-1/2  is  usually what we  use as a rule of thumb in ourcalculations.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  What are  the underlying reasons  for your forecast  of exportsbeing as low  as it is in comparison  to other forecasts?  I  guess it's not important whatother people think in some  sense,  but you must have  a lower forecast  for foreign GDP.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  To a degree.  The swing in  exports in our forecast,  as  ourmodels  depict it, owes to the  relative price term  more  than to what we  are  saying  aboutthe slowdown  in  the growth in  foreign  GDP.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So, that has more  to do with the appreciation  of the dollar?

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes.  Forecasters  do vary  in terms of the  speed  and strength ofthe reaction to changes  in exchange  rates that they put into their models.  I don't think wereally  are an outlier in terms  of the nature of our model  being radically  different  fromother models.  Our forecasts  are comparatively  a little weak on some countries,  but I donot think we  are  radically different.  We do systematically  take relative  price effects  intoaccount,  and I think we  see them as quite elastic  on the export  side.  Through both  1998and  1999,  the exchange  rate  has  a significant effect in  slowing exports.2/3-4/98The other missing piece is the decision  on  our part to utilize  a forecasting  strategythat we  have wrestled  with since the  middle of the year.  That relates  to how  we  evaluatethe  very rapid growth  of exports that occurred in the first half of 1997  and how toincorporate  that development  looking  forward.  We have  taken  a middle course.  Abouttwo Greenbooks  ago, we indicated  a change in  our strategy, as it were, in the  sense that inforecasting  growth rates, we were  going to be guided by the fundamentals.  We were  notgoing  to assume  that because  the growth of exports  had exceeded our forecasts for thefirst half of 1997, we should extrapolate  that forward.  This strategy was adopted partlybecause  we concluded that we did not understand some  of the  elements  that had driventhe high numbers  in the first half of 1997.  In addition,  we  had tested our model in asmany different  ways as we  could, and we thought that on average  it was robust andtherefore  that we should be  guided by it.  So, we have  not added, if you  will,  anunexplained  factor to the  growth rate in  1998  and  1999.  That causes  a very rapidnot this was the  right  strategy to take with respect  to forecasting  export growth.The data that we have, particularly  the  data we just got for the fourth  quarter, hadslightly higher  exports in them than  we had written  down in the Greenbook but  not bymuch  or enough to make  us think that this strategy of not assuming an  additionalunexplained element  to export  growth was the wrong thing to do.  I think we feltsupported by the Beigebook  stories that we have been  hearing, by the purchasingmanagers'  data that were released  today, and by the information  obtained through  theextra calls  about the effects  of Asian  developments  that we  made  with the help  of ourReserve  Bank colleagues.  There are responses from members  of the private sector2/3-4/98suggesting that  there is  some evidence to date,  along with  increasing  uncertainty  andconcern,  that export  growth  is,  in fact,  going to slow  dramatically.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I do not doubt  that it is going to slow.  Dropping  off the  cliff isthe question.  The  other area of uncertainty  that is  actually more important in thinkingabout the  slowing rate of GDP growth  is inventories.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't know that  it is more important.  I think they're  both veryimportant  in the short run here.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Okay, but given the change  in the rate of change,  don'tinventories end up being more important?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Setting aside  the very fine points of the effects of seasonaladjustments,  net exports  are the  bigger drag  in the  first few quarters  of this year.  There  isa dynamic  here that  I alluded  to very briefly.  I think you are  right.  As  I have  looked atother forecasts  and tried to figure  out the arithmetic  I have seen,  our consumption  forecastlooks  relatively strong compared  to many of the outside forecasts.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  And business fixed investment?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Business fixed  investment is in the  ballpark of the  outside forecasts.So, I think you've  put your finger on two key elements.  On inventories, I have seenforecasts  that  anticipate rates of over $40 billion  of inventory  accumulation  through  theyear.  That is well beyond the final  sales  growth that they  are forecasting  and suggeststhat they feel businesses  will be happy with  an  ongoing rise in their inventory-sales  ratios.I don't see  any reason  to anticipate  that  in the  market that we  see now.  Nothing  is inshort  supply.  The latest purchasing managers'  report  said that absolutely zero things werein short  supply, and prices are  falling.  It just does  not look like an environment  where2/3-4/98goods producers  or merchants  want to stock up.  So,  we think our forecast is internallyconsistent  and reasonable,  but if anything in  the final  demand dynamics  pushes theeconomy toward stronger-than-expected  growth, we do not have  a cushion  here.Inventories  would in that event add to the upside  surprise relative to our forecast.I don't want to intrude  too much on Karen's territory  but in regard to the commentthat we have net  exports falling  off the fence  on the  international  side, I think in thepre-FOMC briefing  that we  gave the Board yesterday--and  you  have all  received copies ofthat briefing--there  were some very interesting indications in the data from the other  sideof the Pacific that suggested  very  abrupt adjustments in current  account  balances  in thefourth quarter.  So, having  something happen very quickly in the United States  as a mirrorimage  of that does  not seem unreasonable.

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  The actual  data  will be  complicated by a residual  seasonalityproblem.  If history repeats itself, the first-quarter  data, as they get announced to theworld, will  show weaker exports  because the fourth quarter is one that we estimate  has abig positive residual  seasonal  factor.  I think such a development  in  the first quarter mightchange the expectational  climate  a little.I took this moment to  check our forecasts of growth in the industrial  countriescompared  to the outside consensus.  Again,  we are not radically different  on the economicoutlook for those countries.  Our forecasts for the Asian  countries  are  somewhat weakerthan a reading of what others are saying.  But the difference  is small,  and we felt we  werebehind the curve for a long time on that and we wanted to catch  up to reality or what wethought it was.  Mike's point  is quite well taken.  We already are  seeing evidence ofsubstantial  improvement in the trade balances  of Korea and several  of the other Asian2/3-4/98countries that  have released trade  data for December.  We even  have,  I believe,  a Januarynumber for Korea.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't want  to extend  this unduly,  but I should  remind you that noteveryone  is expecting  a  stock market  decline.  As I said, our consumption  forecast  doesnot look weak and our business  fixed investment  forecast  does  not look all that weakrelative  to other forecasts.  But if we  were to assume  a modest rise in the stock market  orsomething  more, then our forecast  would be very much closer to the consensus.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  don't want to prolong this either, but there  is aninteresting  issue related to this on which I would like to have  your reaction.  When theMexican problem emerged, the collapse in their trade  was immediate  and direct, but ithad very little in  the way of a  multiplier effect because  virtually  everything Mexico  wasdoing was  vis-a-vis  the United  States.  What is  the impact, for example,  of the  Asianproblems  on Europe and Canada  and elsewhere  and in turn on our trade  with thosecountries?

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  We  asked  our analysts  to calculate mentally, econometrically,  orindeed  using any  other estimating  device they have  available  to them, how  much theyhave lowered  their economic  forecasts  for Canada,  Japan,  and major  European  countriesin response  to the events  in troubled  Asian economies.  Of course, the  answer variesdepending  upon the country.  The most pronounced  effects  were  on Japan.  We  usedappears  to be  the month before the world generally  began  to recognize  the scope that theAsian problem  would eventually take  on.  In Japan,  the  weakening  impact  on  GDP is onthe order  of a full 1-1/4  percentage  points for  1998  and almost  1 percentage point for  1999.2/3-4/98We  have  written down  the Japanese  forecast considerably  since  September, and weattribute  that almost in its entirety to the  Asian  effect; there  are other  factors but they tendto be offsetting one way  or another.For Europe, running my eye down the  column of estimates, I would say thenumber tends to be about 1/2  percentage point of GDP.  We have  estimated  an elasticity  ofone for our export demand  from these  economies.  If their GDP slows by 1/2 percentagepoint, we translate  that using an elasticity  of one  into their demand for our exports.  ForCanada, which is not to be  overlooked because  of its importance  in our trade, thewrite-down  has been  significantly less.  But it is still several  tenths--2,  3, or 4 tenths--thatanalysts would  attribute to  the Asian effect.  In the case of Canada, that has been  offset byother factors to the point where the  actual forecast  has not changed by that  much.Obviously,  had the Asian  slowdown not happened, we would be  getting more demandfrom Canada because  the domestic  Canadian economy  is quite strong.  So  we haverepeatedly  asked people to be very aware of the Asian impact  both with regard to itseffect on the exchange  rate  and on  the real  demand  for our goods.  They have come  backwith numbers  on this order of magnitude.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I was at a meeting yesterday  where there was  a discussion of theIMF's forecast for particular industrial  nations  and for the  industrial world as  a whole.With  regard to the effect of Asian developments,  I was  struck in listening to the forecastpresented  by Mike  Mussa at the difficulty the  IMF staff, too,  was having  because thereare a lot of things one has  to disentangle  before one can isolate  the Asian  effects.  On theone hand, the IMF staff has less of an Asian  effect on paper,  but Mussa does  not havemuch  influence  over the individual  analysts.  So, he is less able  to force consistency2/3-4/98across the  forecast than Karen  has been.  He has  a smaller  change in the current accountbalance for Asia but, on the basis of what he  said, I think he actually would  be closer thanhis  staff to what we have.  He  gets  numbers that  are  of the same order of magnitude.  Theone difference  was that he was  assuming the effects  on Japan would all be offset by somecombination  of exchange  rate changes  and other developments;  precisely what he had inmind was  difficult to appraise  because everything  depends  on one's starting  point intogether.  Like everyone else he  had to guesstimate  a multiplier there,  and he hadestimates that were in the 3/4 percent  range.  Ours  is probably a little higher  than that, butit is well  within  the same ballpark.  However, his  analysis produced  a surprising numberfor the Europeans  at  the table.  Both the French  and Germans  said it was a much biggernumber than they were thinking  about  and that is going to mark things down.One point that it  seems to me is very  misleading from an  analytical standpoint isthat  the Europeans  always  look at their growth rates  on  a year-over-year  basis.  So,year-over-year  growth  in Europe  may  be the same in  1998 as in  1997  because  1997 was  agood year, picking up toward  the year-end.  But if we  look at fourth quarter over fourthquarter, we  get something  like a half percent  markdown  and that is essentially  the halfpercent  that Karen was talking  about because  we  used to have  the  same growth rate  in1998 as we had in  1997.  The interesting  thing  will  be to  see how the disconnect  getsresolved in  1998 between  what is actually  happening  in  markets  as opposed to  1998 beingas  good  a growth  year as  1997  and incidentally  how that will  affect the mood in Europe,in  particular.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I'm afraid I am  going to belabor this a little further.  The incomeeffect is one thing.  We  discussed that and we may come  out at slightly different placesabout the  importance  of Southeast Asia or at least the  countries  affected  so far and howwell  integrated our economies  may be.  Let me  ask about the  relative price effect  and theeffect of the exchange  rate  appreciation.  Maybe  you answered  this and I missed it, but Iam  struck by the  sharp  change in the international  outlook, which was evident  in the lastGreenbook  as well  as this  one, and the fact, of course,  that the  dollar has beenappreciating  since the  spring of 1995.  I guess that is the heart of my question.  I don'thave a  sense of what is going on in your forecast.

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I guess I did not follow  the  question too well.  I think if onelooks  at Chart 3--

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I am trying to say that it is not news that the dollar is higher.

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  In putting together the Greenbook  forecast,  we  have notextrapolated the  strength of the dollar.  We saw the  dollar rise  from the  spring  of 1995into  1996.  Our view  was that to some degree the rise  was warranted because  in the  springof 1995  the dollar was exceptionally weak,  and there were good reasons  for it to rise.  Ihave not done this exercise  and I cannot quote numbers  to you, but one  can  look back atthe forecast  as it was presented a year  ago today.  Indeed in  a briefing that was deliveredyesterday,  a copy of which I believe  you have received,  staff in Research  and Statisticsdid precisely  that.  In January  1997  we were not expecting the dollar to continue toappreciate the way that it has,  and we were not expecting  the U.S.  economy  to be asrelatively  strong  as it has been.  So, most of the  appreciation  that you can see in Chart  32/3-4/98from the beginning  of 1997  to the beginning  of 1998,  which  was quite considerable,  wasa surprise  as it evolved.We have gone back and looked again  at how best to parse that into the relativeexchange  rates for the price  terms that we  put into the export  equation  and the relativeprice terms that  we put into our import equations.  We incorporated  more currencies  thanwe  had before because  so much  of what was taking place  that caused the dollar toappreciate  involved currencies  that we had not been  systematically  using in ourcalculation.  We  added a couple  of currencies  and then we decided that we shouldperhaps  look at them individually.  The end result of that  analysis  is that a great deal ofthe  slowing that we  are seeing is  projected to come through  the relative  price term.  Thebars  on that final chart, Chart  7,  tell you what our model  was telling  us,  namely that theappreciation  of the dollar pushed up  imports and will continue to push up imports forsome  time.  Concurrently, it is going to  slow exports  through  the end of the forecastperiod  in  1999.If the dollar appreciates  further,  we will send out a March  Greenbook  thatincludes  an even  weaker  foreign  sector.  I don't know  how else to adjust our forecast  inresponse  to the ongoing  appreciation  of the dollar.  If the  dollar simply stays  as high as itis, which is loosely speaking what we have  assumed, we  are depending  on price  inflationin Asia to cause  some real  appreciation  of the currencies  there to offset some of theappreciation  we  have experienced.  Until that comes  on stream, we have these  relativeprice terms  that our analysis  is telling us have powerful  effects on exports  and imports.Export demand  price elasticities  are not quite  at  1 but are between  0.7  and  1 with somelags,  and the lags  in our exports  are  longer than those for our imports.2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further questions?  If not, who  would  like tostart the Committee  discussion?  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  economic  growth  in the Twelfth  District  picked upin recent  months.  The pickup was  broad-based  and it occurred  in most areas  of theDistrict.  Payrolls  expanded most quickly in the  states  of Utah,  Nevada, and Arizona,where employment  growth  accelerated to annual rates  of 4.6, 6.6, and 9.5  percentrespectively in recent months.  Employment growth in California and Washington  alsoaccelerated,  rising above a 3  percent annual  average pace  during the last months  of 1997.With the exceptions  of Idaho, Alaska, and Hawaii,  employment  growth in the Districtstates  was running  above the  national pace.  Employment growth in the District alsocontinues  to outpace  growth in the region's  labor force, pushing  unemployment ratesdown  and creating  very tight labor markets, particularly in urban  areas.  The District-wideunemployment rate  fell to 5.3  percent in November,  a full  percentage  point  lower than  ayear earlier  and the lowest it has been  since  March  of 1990.  In the District's fastestgrowing  states,  unemployment rates have  fallen  to between 2.8 and 3.9  percent.Construction  and services  are the  fastest growing sectors in the District but manufacturingcontinues  to be a key contributor  to District employment.  Manufacturing  employmentposted strong gains  in recent months,  spurred by rapid  growth in high-tech and  aircraftproduction.The  generally  positive outlook  in the District is tempered  by reports of tight laborconditions  and uncertainties  regarding  developments  in East Asia.  In  several  areas  in theDistrict,  employee  shortages have  begun  to hamper plans  to expand production.  Initialreports from District  states  indicate  that recent  developments  in East Asia have reduced2/3-4/98the demand for exports  of some  commodities,  primarily raw and processed  agriculturalgoods  and  lumber and wood products.  At this early  stage, other vulnerable  industries,such  as high-tech  equipment,  reportedly have not been greatly  affected.Developments  in  East Asia  also are having  some effect on  business loanconditions  in the District.  In recent months,  East Asian-owned  branches  and agencies,which account  for 20 percent of total  business  loans in the District,  have tended to tightencredit standards  and terms on business  loans, in part due to concerns  about the capitalpositions  of their parents.  Reports  also indicate  that some commercial  banks in theDistrict have tightened standards  for nonbank affiliates  and subsidiaries  of East Asiancommercial  firms.  That does not apply to Japanese  firms.  Finally, reports  indicate  someincrease  in  credit demand  by Japanese firms,  in part because  their other credit  sourceshave become less  attractive or less available.Turning to the national outlook, there have  been few  surprises with  regard to theoverall  U.S.  economy  since we  met in December.  As expected, economic  activity wasrobust last quarter and inflation remains  subdued.  Our outlook for  1998  is much the  sameas it was in December.  We continue  to think that at the current  funds rate,  growth  in realGDP is likely to slow to about 2 percent this year and price  inflation is  unlikely to changemuch  despite a pickup  in wage inflation  in our forecast.  However, it is obvious that thereis plenty of uncertainty  in  the outlook.  Traditional models  have been  incorrectlypredicting  slower real GDP growth for the past year and a half.  Thus far, however,  theupside  surprises have  not been associated  with rising price  inflation.  It  is likely thateconomic  activity is being  boosted and inflation  is being held back to  some extent by apositive productivity  shock, but we do not know  how much  of an effect this  factor will2/3-4/98have  or how long it may  last.  I  would feel  better about  the long-run  prospects  for theeconomy if economic  activity were  currently  slowing to a rate that appeared  to besustainable  in the long run.  Given that we have yet to  see such a slowdown,  the risk tomy forecast would  appear to be skewed to the  upside for both output  and inflation.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Overall  economic  activity  in the Richmond District  appearsto have  strengthened  rather than  weakened in recent weeks.  With  respect to goods,  someof the manufacturers  in our region  are reporting faster  growth in January in bothshipments  and new orders.  Service  sector revenues  appear to be continuing  the stronggrowth they registered toward the  end of 1997.  At this  point, it is too  early to estimatewhat the impact of Asian  developments  on our regional economy  is ultimately  going tobe.  There is a lot of speculation  but no hard information  at this stage.Wage  growth has picked up--I think it is fair to  say noticeably--in  our District oflate.  Upward  wage pressures  are much  more widely  reported now  than they were  earlier,especially in the retail  sector.  There is no evidence  yet of any broad attempt to pass wageincreases  through to prices, but we do have  the impression that it is becoming  a littleeasier to push  some cost increases  through  in  some sectors  of the economy.  For example,a contact at  one of the Virginia airports  indicated that the  airport is raising rental  rates andthe fees they charge  airlines.  We have  heard similar stories relating to the  prices  chargedby some manufacturers  and some  retailers.  This is not a general  development  yet, but wehave heard a few  stories  along those lines.Housing markets  continue  to tighten in our region.  Inventories  of single-familyhomes in the Washington  area in particular  dropped sharply in  late 1997  due to increased2/3-4/98demand.  We have  information that construction  activity, construction  costs  and, inresponse to the question  Jerry Jordan  asked earlier,  new home prices  are rising in thisarea.  We also  see that in  some other District markets  like Charlotte.Regarding  the national  picture, I still  believe, like Bob Parry, that because  of thestrength  of the domestic  economy the  upside risks are a  greater  danger going forward thanthe potential  drag from net exports stemming  from developments  in Asia.  In  my view, toreally boil it down, the key is consumer  fundamentals.  I believe  they are exceptionallyfavorable  at this  stage.  Labor markets  are  still  very tight and wages  are rising in general,however  one may interpret  the last quarterly ECI report.  With inflation  subdued for now,most of these  increases  are  in real wages  rather than in nominal  wages.  More broadly,real  disposable income rose at an annual  rate of almost 5  percent in the  fourth quarter.Debt  service burdens  are high but they are manageable.  In this  situation, it is notsurprising that consumer  sentiment, on both the Michigan  and the  Conference  Boardmeasures,  is  at a very high  level.  Consumer  spending, it seems  to me, may remain  quitestrong this year not only in the first half, as is being projected by the Greenbook, but inthe second half as  well.  If it does  and if financial  conditions remain favorable,  businessinvestment and  housing activity are  likely to remain robust as well.Despite  all this, the  Greenbook is projecting that nominal GDP growth  is going to1998.  That is mainly because of the  substantial hit from  Asia, although  some of thefactors that Cathy Minehan  was suggesting  are  also relevant.  In my view, it is notunreasonable  to question  whether such  an abrupt decline  in nominal  GDP growth  will infact occur.  Even if it does,  the Greenbook is still projecting that the core  CPI rate will2/3-4/98remain  steady  at  about 2-1/2 percent  on a consistently measured basis  in  1998  and  1999rather than declining  further.  This relatively  favorable result hinges  on the belief that thefactory utilization  rate is going to decline appreciably  over the  next couple  of years andoffset  the impact of continuing tight  labor markets.In short from my standpoint, while the  Greenbook projection  is certainlyplausible, its realization  depends  on  a lot of developments  that may or may not occur.  Irecognize, of course,  that Asian  developments  could turn out to be worse than expected.But it seems to me that the  striking rebound, especially in recent days, in most Asianstock markets  suggests that with the possible exception  of Indonesia, this crisis is beingcontained  at least for now.  Also, the  negative effects  of the crisis are being  offset in partby the stimulative impact of reflows of capital  to U.S. markets,  which have  helped tolower U.S.  long-term interest  rates.  All in all, I conclude  that the greater  risk goingforward is on the upside.

MR.  BOEHNE.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  The  economy in the Philadelphiaregion remains  strong and labor markets  are tight, but there  are few indications thatinflation is  accelerating.  Businesses in the District continue  to find ways to deal withtight labor markets.  One  illustration is  an auto manufacturing  plant in the District thatwas faced with  a strong demand for a new  sports utility vehicle.  Recognizing  thedifficulty  of finding  850 additional  workers to  add  a third shift, the company  spent some$30 million to install new  robotic equipment over the Christmas  holidays, therebyreducing the need for additional  workers  to 350.  Indeed, the  substitution of capitalequipment  for production workers  by manufacturers  is widespread  in the District.2/3-4/98Construction workers  are  in strong  demand not so  much for adding  bricks and mortar butbecause producers  of everything from pet food to railroad  wheels  are installing  newequipment as labor-saving  devices.In the residential  area,  as some  others  have reported, District builders  tell me thatthe  demand for new  housing is very  strong.  As  an  example of that, Super Bowl Sunday isusually a  very slow day for showing real  estate,  but this year the floor traffic was  heavyand sales were quite strong.  The price increases  for new homes appear  to be holding,although  prices  for existing homes remain  flat.  There seems  to be a real change in tastes.If a seller has a regular sized bedroom  and a regular sized bath, the  house will not move.Buyers want bathrooms  as big as traditional bedrooms.We are  hearing reports  from some manufacturers  who  export to Asia that someorders are being cancelled and others  postponed.  The Asian problem  is also affectingagriculture.  Poultry is  a big industry in the Third District, particularly in Delaware  andthe south central  part of Pennsylvania.  With the bird flu scare in Asia and the strongdollar, there is  a slowing  demand for poultry exports  to Asia.  As a result, this poultry isbeing  sold on the domestic  market and chicken  prices  are coming down.Turning to the  nation, I think there are three  key uncertainties  that we need to dealwith.  The first is that the  national data show  a very powerful  economy  in  1997 cominginto  1998,  fueled largely by  strong consumption  and investment  growth.  Our evaluationof the anecdotal  information points to some slowing in demand stemming  from the falloutfrom the  Asian  situation.  But how much of a damping effect  is uncertain,  although  I seemore growth  than the Greenbook.2/3-4/98The second uncertainty  is that the disinflation process  has had  surprising  stayingpower.  Wage gains continue to be  offset by productivity  gains, so inflation is fallingwhile corporate profits remain high.  How  much more  staying power this  disinflationprocess has is also  uncertain, although  I suspect it has  a while  to run.  If businesses cannotget more volume  out of existing resources,  they undertake  additional rounds  ofdownsizing.The third uncertainty,  which is more for discussion tomorrow  so I will touch  on itonly briefly, is that monetary  policy is roughly neutral, but it may be tightening implicitlywith the  nominal fed funds rate held constant and inflationary expectations  falling.However,  the money  supply has been growing faster lately.What should we  make of these uncertainties  in the  national  economy?  I think  weneed  a wide peripheral  vision because I don't think we know where the real danger isgoing to come from.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Over the past year, the performance  ofthe  Sixth District economy generally has paralleled  that of the nation, and with fewexceptions  that continues  to be the  picture that we see.  Today, rather than run through  adetailed  commentary sector by sector, I thought I would  concentrate my remarks  on a fewimportant  differences  and concerns that I have  begun  to note.First, the Asian  situation has had only a marginal  impact on our District so far.Shipments to Asia have  moderated, especially  shipments  of fertilizer, pulp, paper,  andcitrus.  A  large chemical  company in our region experienced  some cancellations  ofshipments to Asia but reportedly was  relieved because  it was  unable to meet those2/3-4/98shipments anyway  due to a  lack of available  rail cars.  People in our aerospace anddefense industries  also have  begun to express concerns  about potential declines  in ordersfrom the Asian part  of the  world.  At the same  time, some interesting asymmetries  areappearing.  One  shipper reported recently that his firm  had added capacity  in anticipationof increased  trade with Latin America, but the firm had to divert that capacity  to meet itscustomers'  demand for more  shipping to bring imports  from Asia to the  United States.Finally, doing business in Asia is clearly more difficult  for District firms.  The owner ofan upscale retail  sunglass  chain with over 2,000 outlets, including  19 in  Asia, reports  thathis Asian  sales  are off some 70 to  80 percent.  The bottom line for the District is  that theoverall effects from  Asia have been minimal  so far, with declines  in our region's exportsto Asia mitigated by stable  growth of exports to Latin America.Second,  after their recent decline,  prices  of oil and natural  gas  are nowapproaching  their historic break-even  levels that in the past would have  caused domesticdrilling and extraction  to begin  to shut down.  However,  we  see no evidence  of thatpattern this time  around, and in fact the rig count remains  at very high levels.  The newdrilling technologies  that I talked about in past meetings have truly brought break-evenprices to much  lower levels.  Hence, we don't expect to see  the slowing in that sector thatwe would have  in past cycles.Third, real estate  activity, especially  residential,  is more  mixed in our region thanappears to be the case nationwide.  Commercial  construction is strong, especially ingrocery and class A office  space, and this  should balance  the weakness  we are  seeing inresidential  construction.  One cautionary note, however,  is that I am starting to get2/3-4/98numerous  expressions  of concern  that pockets of excessively speculative  commercialconstruction  are emerging, notably in the north Atlanta  market.Fourth, we are getting mixed signals from lenders.  Consistent with the  loanofficers'  survey, credit still  seems to be available  and competition  is fierce.  When lendersare asked whether credit  standards  are slipping,  the response is  generally no, but lendersthen go  on to say that because  of competition  they are apt to grant loans at lower  ratesthan in the past.  This seeming  disconnect between their perception  of the  links betweencredit standards  and pricing  for risk is something  we  should be concerned  about.Fifth, with respect to wages and prices,  like everyone else  we continue  to getreports of labor  shortages, and firms  are either going to great lengths to hire qualifiedworkers or they are curtailing production.  For example,  shipbuilders in New  Orleans  areresorting to hiring workers  from overseas to fill the need for welders,  shipfitters,  andother workers.  One national  trucking executive  reported idling 10  percent  of hisequipment  because he has not been able to find qualified drivers.  Despite such problems,however,  wage increases  in our region appear to have been held to  moderate levels,  andthis also  appears to be the case  with prices.  In  our most recent manufacturing  survey, theportion of firms  reporting that they are paying  higher prices  for materials  decreased,  asdid the proportion  of firms  indicating that they received higher prices for finished goods.At the national  level, we  see an  economy  that continues  to "hum along"  with few,if any, of the signs of slowing that many of us have been forecasting for several  meetingsnow.  However, as others  have observed,  I do not believe that we  have yet seen much ofthe slowing effects  from the Asian problems  and what  they hold for the  United States.  Ofcourse, the threshold question  is how great the  negative impact eventually  will be.  It does2/3-4/98seem clear that the  Asian shock will  forestall  the need for any  policy tightening move inthe short run.  Clearly,  the economy  will not continue to get the boost to GDP from netexports  that the recently  released report suggests  we got in the fourth quarter.Stepping back, it does  seem to me that the risks to any forecast have changed intwo respects  since our last meeting.  They have  gotten more  symmetric  and they havegotten greater.  I guess one could say the distribution  of risks now has fatter tails than itdid the last time  we were together.  For me, the  wild cards continue  to be related to Asia,the consumer, and investment  spending.  While  one certainly can  argue that all thesesectors  will slow  in coming  quarters, there  is also a significant  probability that all may notslow.  For example,  it isn't difficult to anticipate  that the increased  disposable incomethat households may  generate by refinancing  their mortgages  to take advantage  of lowerinterest rates will  stimulate  and help maintain  consumer spending.  Similarly, the  reportswe  get are that much of the recent surge in investment spending is motivated by the desireof U.S.  businesses to cut costs  so as to maintain  profit margins  in the face  of competitionfrom lower import prices.  Clearly, this downward pressure  on prices  will continue  as aresult of the Asian crisis, and this could help maintain  investment  spending at higherlevels than  would otherwise  be expected.Finally, of course,  as others  have  suggested, the impact from  Asia may prove to beeither substantially more severe  or substantially  less  severe than our most likely scenarioindicates.  On balance,  as I hope  my comments have  suggested,  I think we continue to bein  a period of very satisfactory  economic performance,  but one where the range ofpotential  outcomes is even wider and  more uncertain  than  when we  last met.  While theAsian shock and its fallout may give us significant  slowing in the economy's  expansion2/3-4/98and a further respite from price pressures, I think it is equally likely that  we  may findourselves  by late  fall or early winter of this year with  almost the  same set of policyquestions  that we faced in November  and December of last year.  Until we  see the Asianeffects  play out, I would say again that I hope  we can  allow ourselves  to enjoy themoment  and use  this period of time to talk out our long-term policy preferences.  Weshould continue to make  the point that low  inflation is also  pro-growth  andpro-employment, and that is  something that not only central bankers  should get excitedabout.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The Seventh  District economycontinues to expand at a moderate  pace with only a few reports thus far that Asiandevelopments  have had any  measurable impact.  However, many of our contacts expecttheir businesses to be  affected as the year progresses.  In the  consumer sector, retailersgenerally ended up being pleased with holiday sales,  but the bimodal holiday  shoppingseason that I mentioned  at our December meeting was quite evident.  After a post-Thanksgiving  lull, sales  picked up noticeably in the week before Christmas  and  thatstrength  then continued into January,  benefiting in part  from gift-certificate  buying  aswell as  the strong housing market that boosted  appliance sales.  Our survey of Michiganretailers  showed the largest December  sales gains since  1994.  Light  vehicle  salesprobably averaged about  15  million units at an  annual  rate in December and  Januarycombined, but  as noted in the Greenbook,  the  monthly sales numbers for December andachieve best  selling car status  in  1997.  Although  low interest rates  and low  gasoline2/3-4/98prices have reduced  the cost of driving,  incentives  remain extremely  important  inmaintaining  sales near the  15  million  unit pace.Manufacturing  activity remains  quite strong in  the District.  Purchasingmanagers'  reports for January  indicated that overall  activity  expanded at about the samepace as in December in Chicago  and  at a  somewhat  faster pace in Detroit and Milwaukee.Contacts  noted very strong demand  in industries  such  as aluminum, steel,  farm and otherheavy equipment, appliances,  chemicals, paper,  and publishing.In terms of the Asian situation, the impact on most Seventh  District industries isstill more  speculation  than reality.  Auto and steel  companies are worried  about possibleincreases  in imports from Korea and Japan,  although that doesn't  seem to have happenedyet.  Several contacts  from a variety of industries reported that Asian manufacturers  anddistributors are experiencing significant difficulties  in borrowing  funds for workingcapital  and other purposes.  Our business contacts report  dramatically  slower businessoperations in those Asian countries,  and friends  of mine who  have been to Thailandindicate  that even the traffic in Bangkok is  now bearable.For most businesses in the Seventh District, the major problem continues to behiring and retaining  competent workers.  In other  words, labor markets are  still very tight.Help-wanted  advertising  increased in  all our major metropolitan  areas  over the  last threemonths of 1997  and that is in contrast to the national  index,  which in December waslower than in September.  The latest survey by Manpower  Incorporated indicates  thathiring plans  nationally  for the  second quarter of 1998  are  up somewhat  from the firstquarter and about the  same  as for the very strong second  quarter of  1997.  These resultswill not be  released until February  23  so they should be treated as  confidential  until then.2/3-4/98Manpower's  own  domestic business apparently  is very strong with  demand for workerswidespread but especially robust at computer, telecommunications,  pharmaceutical,  andfood processing firms.  Other  contacts indicate  that high salaries for COBOL  and

[SECTION]

FORTRAN programmers  are  drawing some  retirees back into the labor force, but wagepressures  generally continue to be relatively  modest,  given the tightness  in labor markets.Turning to the national  outlook, I think the risks are  somewhat more balancedtoday than they seemed to be in December.  The level of real  GDP currently  appears  to beabove  potential.  Labor markets  are the tightest  in a generation  and yet there is  still nohard evidence of accelerating  inflation.  Looking  ahead, the key issues  are Asia,inventories, and, of course, inflation.  Considering  the composition  of fourth-quartergrowth,  our view is that growth this year will slow  to its trend rate due  to sizable dragscoming from declines  in  net exports  and inventory  investment.  As we discussed  earlier,the biggest sources of uncertainty  are the Asian  situation  and the possible inventorycorrection.  Our outlook is about as pessimistic as the Greenbook regarding  Asia andslightly less  so on the outlook for an  inventory correction.  Despite  this anticipatedslowing of GDP growth, we expect  labor markets to remain  tight.  Without mitigatingfactors  such as recent exchange rate  movements and heightened  competition from importsalong with  energy price declines,  we would be concerned  that CPI inflation was poised toincrease.All  in all  then,  we face risks  on both the upside and the downside.  Withoutsignificant slowing  in the growth  of economic  activity, wage  and price pressures  appearlikely to intensify.  However, the Asian  crisis seems to offer the kind of non-monetary2/3-4/98policy  restraint that can keep aggregate  demand in line with the economy's  potentialoutput.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  The New England economycontinues  to perk  along with perhaps  more  strength than at least  some other regions.Employment  is rising at close to the national pace.  The  unemployment rate in  all six NewEngland  states  is below the  nation's  and well below in the  case of Massachusetts,  NewHampshire,  and Vermont.  Commercial  vacancy rates  are extremely  low  in themetropolitan  Boston area  where there is  a small  amount of speculative construction  underway, but real  estate markets are more mixed  elsewhere  in the region.  In  particular,Hartford's rather weak  commercial  real estate recovery  has been  hit hard by the closing ofseveral major retailers,  leading  to an increase in retail  vacancy  rates  and a drop in retailrental rates.  Prices  and wages remain  stable overall,  though manufacturing  wages havebegun to increase  at about the national rate  after earlier weakness.  Premiums continue  tobe paid for hard-to-find employees with high-tech engineering  or software  skills.Our take  on the  Asian crisis, to the extent we  know much  about  it at this point,was reported to the Committee  in the earlier memo that we  all received, but I want  tounderscore  one thing.  That is the potential  impact of the  downturn  in Asian economieson the region's universities.  It is expected  to be significant both in terms of the  ability ofthose universities to attract students  from the Asian countries,  which  have  been veryimportant in terms of full-paying  foreign  students, and in  the ability of current  studentsfrom Asia to stay on in universities in this country.2/3-4/98Two items of broad  regional  import dominated our economic  news  aside from theAsian crisis.  First, we had a  severe winter ice storm that  affected the northern  NewEngland  states in January.  This storm hit the central and northern  portions  of Maine andNew Hampshire,  the area around Burlington,  Vermont,  and also north  of the border inCanada.  Fortunately, the storm  came well after the New  Year and well before the MartinLuther King holiday, so  ski  areas  didn't lose  holiday business, but that is one of the fewgood things we can  say about it.  Many businesses  in the affected  areas were  unable toopen for more than a week  or at least the best part of a week, and  some rural  areas werewithout power for a much  longer period.  The storm was unusual in the  extent of damageto utility property.  Utilities in the  three states estimate  their total cost for capitalreplacement  and  additional  labor at about $80  million, with $60 million of this  in Mainealone where the storm covered  a wide area and resulted in some  destruction oftransmission  towers as well  as power lines.  The full extent  of the damage to forestry  andagriculture  will take longer to estimate.  The spring's  logging and maple syrup harvestingactivities should provide further information on the extent of damage  to the forests.A couple  of interesting vignettes:  One apple  grower reported that apple trees werecomparatively unaffected  by the ice because the latter's weight was less than the capacityof most trees  to hold relatively heavy fruit.  Dairy farmers  report that cows  were havingdifficulty producing milk as a result of the storm.  Finally, with  true New England spirit,members  of the Bank's  Small Business Advisory  Council commented  on the increase  inneighborly spirit that has prevailed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is that in  the GDP?2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It  can help!  The  second issue of note is the purchase  of DigitalEquipment by Texas-based  Compaq Computers,  billed as the largest takeover in thehistory of the computer industry.  This purchase  along with Compaq's recent  acquisitionof Tandem  makes the  company the  second largest computer maker  in the  world behindIBM.  Now, this  is not important in terms of the overall  macroeconomic  picture perhaps,but only a couple of years  ago employment  repercussions  from the purchase would havecaused  waves  of fear  throughout New England.  Now, I would  guess that businesses  arejust waiting to snap up any laid off high-tech workers.  It has gone by without  a ripple onthe local  scene.On the national  scene, we agree with  the Greenbook's  assessment  of rather robustconsumption  at least for  1998  and renewed strength in business  fixed investment  at leastfrom the fourth-quarter  level.  We  also are largely  in agreement  with the Greenbookforecast regarding the  drag from net exports due to the  Asian situation, though  as I notedbefore  we could  quibble  a bit about  whether exports will  be as weak as the Greenbooksuggests.  However, we are most skeptical  about  the relatively large negative  inventoryswing.  We agree that there may well be negative inventory  effects, but we  wonder howlong and how negative  they will be  given the relative  strength of final sales, the prospectsfor business spending,  the view in  financial  markets,  abundant credit, and strongconsumer  confidence--all  things  that people have mentioned.  Only one  other majorforecaster, DRI, projects  as significant an  inventory correction,  again giving  us somepause  about the risks inherent in this  aspect of the forecast.Overall,  we anticipate  a bit stronger economy in  1998,  with growth  much closer  topotential than  the staff forecast  and some upward  pressure  on  core inflation as  a result.2/3-4/98Thus, I agree  with others  who have  spoken  before  that there  are  risks  on the upside to theGreenbook  forecast, though it is not possible to talk about  a forecast these days withoutmentioning the potential for downside  Asian-related  risks as well.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MCTEER.  The Eleventh District economy  remains strong in almost everyrespect,  although the crisis  in Southeast Asia has  caused expectations  to be downgradedconsiderably.  The January go-around among  our directors,  for example,  was noticeablyless positive than December's  in terms of expectations.Nationally, in my first  cut at forecasting  1998,  I had real  GDP growing at 3percent  and the CPI at 2 percent.  Then, I was shocked to see the Greenbook's  inflationforecast come in  under mine, so we are  going to  go back to the  drawing board.  That hasnever happened before.  I think  a good rule of thumb on these  forecasts  is to take theGreenbook forecast  and  add about a percentage  point to real growth  and subtract about  apercentage point from the CPI!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That would be tough!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The trouble is, they already did that!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I must say that their  strong final  sales number upset  mycalculations  a little.  In any case, we really do expect  to see more  of the same--very  lowinflation combined  with quite  strong real  growth.Most of what I have said in recent meetings relating  to the  growth  of the EleventhDistrict economy being stronger than  the  national  average, particularly  in terms  ofemployment  growth,  still  applies but with  one exception.  That is oil  drilling.  Oil drillinghas been straining  against capacity  limits even  with the  lower crude prices  that we have2/3-4/98seen in recent months.  It is still very strong, as Jack Guynn  indicated, but drilling  costshave  increased  substantially  during the past year.  Those higher costs and related budgetconstraints  among the smaller and weaker firms have  relieved  some  of the capacityconstraints.  It  is now possible to find a  rig again where  one could not be found before,although  at exorbitant prices.  Some of the concern regarding  the  Southwest  has to domostly with  the direct impact of the Asian crisis but also to some extent with the indirectimpact coming through  our region's largest trading partner, Mexico.  Mexico  isvulnerable  not only to the Southeast Asian  export competition  but also to the continuedlow or declining oil prices.  I find it remarkable that in recent daysWe made  a special effort to gather information from many of the  larger companiesin our District about the impact of the Asian  situation.  It is hard to draw any firmconclusions about the net impact on the region, but a few  patterns  are worth  mentioning.First, in high-tech, the impact is nearly a wash.  Computer producers  like Dell andCompaq expect  to benefit from  some lower prices for semiconductors,  while chipproducers  like Texas Instruments  and Motorola expect to lose.Second,  the area's defense contractors  like Bell Helicopter, Lockheed Martin, andRaytheon  have expressed  surprisingly little concern  given their exposure in SoutheastAsia.  For example, Bell  Helicopter has a couple  of big orders  in Asia that are nowquestionable,  but they expect  to make up for any declines in  sales to Asia by increasedorders from South America.  Area ranchers  are  net losers as  export demand  falls off.  TheAsian credit crunch  is beginning  to be noticed in Texas. a verylarge  chemical  company reports that they are not selling much  petrochemical  feed stocks2/3-4/98and chemicals to Korea because  of an  unwillingness  to accept  letters  of credit fromKorean banks.  The expansion  of Samsung's  very large new chip plant in Austin is beingdelayed  by a lack of financing.  And we  have heard anecdotes  that Japanese  banks havestopped rolling over lines  of credit to some  large Texas companies.  Fortunately,  thosecompanies  have access to other sources of credit.  Let me conclude  by saying that  giventhe strength  and momentum  of the Eleventh District  economy, if we are  going to be hardhit by the  fallout from Asia, this is a good time to have  it happen.At the national  level,  the prolonged combination  of rapid output  and employmentgrowth with lower inflation  continues to test the limits of the old rules of thumb andargues for a revision  of those rules.  The momentum going into this quarter and thedisinflation and  deflation in the pipeline,  augmented  by Asia, suggest that theunemployment/inflation  tradeoff will  continue  to improve before  it gets  worse.  Weshould be glad we removed the bias toward tightening  at the last meeting,  and  it is not tooearly in my opinion  to start talking at this meeting  about whether and  when to ease.  Ibelieve  that makes me the first to use the  "E" word, Mr. Chairman.  Rising realshort-term  interest rates as inflation has moderated have made policy tighter in  somesense,  as  have the strength in the foreign exchange  value of the dollar and decliningsensitive  commodity prices.  The yield curve is close to flat  and the graph in one of ourhandouts  shows that  very bad things usually happen  shortly after yield curves turnnegative.  Only the monetary  aggregates  suggest that  policy is  accommodative,  but wehave not  shown  any confidence  in  the reliability of those  measures  for a long time.So far at the national  level,  the Asian decline  probably  has helped ourmacroeconomic  balance more than it has hurt, but it remains  a potentially large negative.2/3-4/98For the record,  I must say that I don't think the  impact of the IMF's interventions  hasbeen  altogether  benign  so far.  Like  the doctors  of old, the IMF does  make  house calls;like the  doctors of old, too often the favorite  remedy is bleeding the patient.  Fightingdeflation  with austerity seems  rather problematical  as does the apparently related  goal  ofcreating current  account surpluses  in developing  countries, which  means  turning theminto capital exporters.  How much of Asia can  have  a current account  surplus at the  sametime  and  what would be the impact on  China if those countries  achieve  it?  It may be truethat many construction  projects and other government-directed  investments  wereill-conceived  in the first place,  but canceling  them in the midst of the crisis doesn't seemto be  the best timing in the world.  It may be that employment  has been misdirected,  butdeliberately  creating  unemployment  hardly  seems the appropriate  cure.  We need to  getthe IMF to give  us a line item veto!

Manufacturing  continues to operate  at relatively  highlevels of capacity utilization and is  a  source of strength for the District  as a whole.Significant investments  are still  being made in our region.  Examples include  the recentannouncement  by Intel of a billion  dollar upgrade to its New  Mexico  plant and theexpansion  by Sumitomo of its New  Mexico  plant that manufactures  computer chips.Construction  activity generally  has been  flat in  the District, but flat at a very high level.We still find  firms in the construction  industry that are  trying to import labor into theregion.  The  farm economy  is  generally in good shape,  although  developments  in  Asiaremain  a concern  for some  in agriculture  as  well as in  other sectors of the regional2/3-4/98economy.  For example, IBP, which is  a large processor  of beef and pork, has  seen a 50percent drop in its international  sales,  with Asia especially contributing  to that.  Also,Japanese  customers are negotiating  very hard for better deals to circumvent  the effects ofthe stronger dollar.  Some firms we have talked  to, as I think Bob McTeer mentioned washappening in his District,  are having a little trouble because  a number of their Asiancustomers  cannot obtain letters of credit, and that has hurt the exports  of those firms tothat part of the  world.Still, District labor markets remain among the tightest in the nation,  and thenumber of firms  reporting larger-than-usual  wage increases  is rising.  To illustrate  this interms of our current labor market  situation, District unemployment  was about 3-1/2 percentin November and  the participation  rate was estimated  at around  70 percent,  in contrast  tothe national  level of about  67 percent.  About half the firms that we spoke to are raisingwages more than usual to attract and retain workers.  As  an example, one manufacturer inColorado reported  average wage  increases  of about 8  percent last year.  A furniturewarehouse  in the Omaha area reported  10  percent increases  at the lower  end of their payscale and,  as I mentioned, IBP for all of its concerns  about  Asia reported that they had toincrease  wages over  15 percent  last year because  labor markets were extremely  tight forthem.  Firms also  are reporting  a variety of incentives to retain  workers,  including theexpansion  of benefits for their employees.  Overall,  therefore,  we have  a very strongeconomy in the region.At the national  level,  we expect growth  into next year at a pace very similar to theGreenbook  forecast.  Having  said that,  we have  also found ourselves  spending  a lot oftime trying to make  sure  we could rationalize  our forecast.  We  looked at the same  factors2/3-4/98that others  already have mentioned, including the outlook for inventory  adjustments,  thestrong dollar,  a fed funds rate that in our opinion  is not accommodative  at this time,  andother factors bearing  on a  forecast of some slowing in  final demand.  But when we  try tofeel  comfortable  with  that forecast,  we remind ourselves  of the very  strong economy inthe fourth quarter  and apparently into the early weeks of this year.  If the markets do notbecome  unsettled, I think there is every reason to expect consumer demand  to stay strong.And unless we have a somewhat  more negative multiplier effect from Asia, we are  leftwith some real upside risks to this forecast.  On balance,  this seems to be a  time to waitand see.  Thank you.

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  The strength  in virtually  all sectors  of the FourthDistrict economy in  1997  was sustained through  year-end  and appears  to have  carriedover into at least the early weeks of the new year.  The  most common  complaint  wecontinue to hear has to  do with recruiting  and retaining people.  Turnover  of workerscontinues to rise,  and reports  of higher compensation  to keep people are  much morefrequent,  along the  lines of several other comments  that already  have been made  here thisafternoon.  The financial  sector is finding it especially  difficult to  attract and retainpeople. One bank that is now represented on  our board of directors put through  a 7.7percent pay structure increase,  and the bank does not believe that increase is  going to beadequate to retain the people they need for their operations.  Job  switching  forsignificantly higher salaries is becoming  more common  for people with computer  skills.All parts  of construction--residential,  commercial,  and  industrial--were  strong  inthe fourth quarter,  and prospects for the spring  and summer are  reported to be very  good.2/3-4/98Construction  contracts increased  significantly in  1997,  and  so far we have  had a  very mildwinter in our part of the country  so that construction  activity  has been seasonally  strong.Bankers report  a growing  sense  that retail  space is  overbuilt.  Nevertheless,  new proposalskeep coming in ever-increasing  numbers  and they are  getting financed.  One director  saidthat REITs have  a ton of money.  He indicated that  there is ample funding  for just aboutany project that gets proposed.Manufacturing  generally continues  to be  strong in our area.  The production oflarge trucks reached  peak levels  in the fourth quarter, and  orders  are reported to be strong,suggesting  that plants producing  trucks will  be operating at  very high  levels through  thefirst half of this year.  Steel orders  and production  also continue  to be very high.  Eventhough imports  are  expected to rise, domestic  absorption  also continues  to increase  sodomestic  production  and orders  haven't  yet weakened  from very high levels.  Onedirector said that foreign  steel  would arrive just in  time to meet his company's  needs.Another asserted that the cutbacks  and consolidations  had ended in the health  care sectorand  that we  should expect faster  increases in  health  care costs  going forward.  In  fact, onedirector commented that on the basis  of what he is observing,  health  care costs  arestarting  to soar in western  Pennsylvania. of a small manufacturingcompany said  that there  seemed  to be  a lot of people who  were trying to put their moneyto  work because  she was  receiving 4 to  5  offers  to buy her company  every week.Help-wanted  advertisements  that a  year or two ago  would have produced  a  lot of resumesnow produce  very few, and the  only ones  from qualified people  are from individuals  whoalready  have jobs  and are looking  for big wage increases.  Commenting  on  very strongworldwide demand  for machinery  to make plastic  goods,  one director  said that there is an2/3-4/98inordinate  amount  of capital  available for acquisitions  in  that industry and that we shouldexpect a  lot of consolidation,  both  domestic  and international.Turning to the Greenbook  forecast  of the national economy,  it is a good news, badnews  story.  The good news  is that I really like this  Greenbook forecast  for 1998.  Thebad news  is  that I simply do not believe  it. [Laughter]  I have tried hard  since  lastThursday night to convince  myself that we got this  lucky in terms of the economy'sperformance  and prospects because  the crony  capitalism and corruption  in Southeast Asiahas  taken us out of the  very difficult policy spot that we had gotten into.  Nominalspending growth  accelerated  in the second half of last year to a pace well  above what theforecasts  were  showing just 6 months  ago, not just the  Greenbook forecast  buteverybody's  forecast.  Nominal  spending growth  accelerated,  real  growth  accelerated,  andmoney growth  accelerated.  Every measure of money came in well  above what had beenexpected, creating  what looked to me like a tough spot to work out of.  Then we got theSoutheast Asian  crisis that supposedly  solves the problem for us.When  I look at components  of the GDP forecast such  as personal income,however, I see  a strongly  rising trend of nominal  personal  income  growth through  1997with all the favorable  factors that  contributed to it, and I then  note that the forecastsuddenly cuts  the rate of growth by half to about the 1990-1991  recession  pace.  I do notbelieve  that forecast. I think it is plausible to  anticipate  that real  growth will  decelerate,and the reason  is simply that there is  nothing in the universe  for which  the seconddifference  is always  positive.  The  second difference  of everything  must turn negative.  Ifthe second  differences of real  growth and employment  slow because we  havesupply-constrained  economies, then  we simply have  to hope that growth  in final  demand2/3-4/98will  slow simultaneously.  I do not find it plausible  to anticipate  that the amount  ofslowing that is necessary  in final demand  is going to come from weaker  exports.  In fact,some companies  in our area that view themselves  as global  companies  now say that theSoutheast  Asian  situation  is an opportunity for them to export high-tech products  thatthey want for their own  foreign operations.  The risk is that the reported  slower  growth ofoutput and employment  will materialize  but not the slower growth in  final demand.  If so,we are  going to find ourselves at some point with  substantially much more upwardpressure on inflation  than is now forecast  or showing through  the numbers,  and we willbe scrambling to catch up.  Thank you.

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  With regard to the District economy, itis hard to imagine that conditions can get any better, with perhaps  a few minorexceptions.  I have described  much of this to you in recent years,  and I will not go overthis terrain again.  A particularly bright spot  at the moment  is construction  activity.  It isstrong in much of the District and probably  would be stronger if it weren't for the factthat there is a labor shortage in the construction  industry  and some projects  are not underway or are going more  slowly than planned  as a consequence  of that.  Another  favorabledevelopment  is that there continues to be virtually  no evidence  of a broad-basedacceleration  of inflation.  But having said that, wage pressures  have  continued tointensify,  and I would expect that  to continue as we go forward.  It  is perhaps  also  worthnoting that the unemployment  rate in the Minneapolis/St.  Paul metropolitan  area has nowdropped below  2 percent.  That is probably a record low, and it is  also significant  giventhe Twin  Cities'  dominant position  in the nonagricultural  sector of the District.  Finally,2/3-4/98Asia is not yet  a significant  issue in the District, although clearly  people in agriculture  andsome other natural  resource industries  are,  I guess it's fair to say, at least a bit concernedabout it.As far as the national  economy is concerned, I certainly agree that  there may beeven  more than the usual  amount of uncertainty  about the outlook.  But, net, I  am moreoptimistic  about real growth than the Greenbook, and I get there mainly because ofproductivity  considerations.  To some extent, based  on statistical judgments but moreimportantly on the anecdotes  that we have heard  over and  over, I have become  convincedthat productivity  is on a more  favorable  trend and therefore  capacity is as well.  I believeaggregate  demand will grow  sufficiently to equal  that capacity.  All  in  all,  I am moreoptimistic than the staff about the potential  growth  of the economy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  As  a lot of people have noted, the Committee  is faced with  anunusual  degree of uncertainty.  We all  said that to each other in December but it is moretrue now.  Uncertainty  does not make today's  decision  harder; in fact, it makes it easier.The fact that there is no imminent  danger of inflation or recession  makes it easy to justifyleaving the monetary policy levers where they are until more evidence  accumulatesbearing on the question  of which way we might want to move them.  Uncertainty  at thislevel,  however, does mean that we are  likely to be facing  very tough  decisions in the nextfew months.  The question  is in which  direction.I can  live with the Greenbook  forecast, but I can  also imagine  the economyproving to be a good deal stronger than the staff projects.  Consumer demand could proveeven  more resilient than they are projecting  based on  strong wage  growth,  attractive2/3-4/98interest rates  for financing homes,  durables,  and cars, and continued  strength  in the stockcould be said  about the Asian crisis  is that it may have bottomed  out and that its currentlypredicted  slowing effects on the U.S. economy  and the rest of the world may not worsenany further.  However, my thinking  that market behavior is irrational,  or indeed even  theChairman  thinking  out loud in the same  vein, does not guarantee that such behavior willnot continue.  Favorable financing and general  optimism also could keep businessinvestment  stronger than projected.If the economy does prove  stronger in the near term than the staff anticipates,  wecould be  faced with a difficult  dilemma as early as next month,  especially if the bigincrease in  the ECI at the end of 1997  turns out not to be a blip attributable  toextraordinary  bonuses for real  estate agents and  stockbrokers  but the beginning of abroad-based  acceleration  in labor compensation.  Some of the comments  around the tableseem to support that possibility.  A decision  to increase the federal  funds rate would bedifficult to defend publicly because  the downward pressures  from declining  import priceswould still be  constraining inflation.  Productivity might  still be exceeding expectationsand the prospect of a slowdown  in the economy from the net export drag and slowerinventory accumulation  would still be highly likely even if it were not showing  up in thecurrent data.  If all this happens, we will have  to face up to  a hard choice  about raisingrates in March.  I do not know how  we would come out, but I think Al Broaddus wouldbe  a lot  less lonely!  [Laughter]Conversely,  I can imagine  the U.S. economy looking  substantially  weaker than theGreenbook forecast  over the  next few months.  This scenario  would depend largely on2/3-4/98psychological  factors  and not on anything likely to be picked up in models.  The list  ofdownside factors includes  some potential  setbacks  in Asia,  such as the lack of politicalwill to carry out the reforms  in  Korea or Japan  or a new round of devaluations, possiblysparked by China and Hong Kong giving  in to pressures  to devalue.  Other downsidefactors  might involve  a spate  of poor U.S.  corporate earnings reports that triggered  a  steepdrop  in the U.S.  stock market and a fall in consumer and business confidence, negativedomestic political  developments,  or escalating tensions  in the Middle East.  Any of thesetriggers would precipitate  a steeper-than-anticipated  reduction  in U.S.  growth and even  anegative  downward  spiral that would threaten  a world recession.  I view this scenario  as alot less likely but a lot more dangerous  than the first.  The Fed might be called  on to actquickly but decisively  to contain the damage  and try to restore healthy growth.  The onething the world cannot afford  right now is a stalling U.S. engine.The hard decision, especially  if events  prove only mildly more negative than nowexpected,  will be to distinguish  between  a  stall and a return to sustainable  growth.  I forone believe  that  the economy's recent  history strongly suggests  two conclusions:  One,that the U.S. economy  is a lot less  inflation-prone in the face of tight labor markets thanwe used to think it was.  Second, that tight labor markets  have important  positive effectson individual  incentives to work and  acquire  skills and  experience  and on businessincentives  to invest in productivity-enhancing  processes  and capital  improvements.Hence, I believe the Fed should be  prepared  to act quickly and decisively to limit damagefrom slow  growth  and rising unemployment.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Usually on college  campuses,  thedemand  for economics  courses  goes up as economic  conditions worsen,  so  I guess in  away I'm glad I switched careers.  Looking  at the forecast,  inflation  seems to bestabilizing at about 2 percent  or so.  That rate is arguably close  to a definition  of stableprices  we might  all endorse,  given  the measurement  errors in the price indices.  Even  atthe present levels of labor force  utilization, we obviously  are not far from NAIRU  as faras  I can tell.  If the Greenbook  is right, more wind will  be taken out of final demand.Among the Greenbook  simulations with  alternative assumptions,  I prefer theforecast that is  given  with no stock market  decline.  It seems to me that  all these possibleprices.  So, I would not crank in lower stock  prices  and would get a slightly more  bullishforecast.  Even so, the unemployment  rate does  rise some,  and while it remains  belowNAIRU,  it does get a little closer.  The summary of present  conditions is  that we arefairly close to target,  both on the price side  and the output side.Most of you have  mentioned the relevant risks.  The upside risk is thatunemployment  is low, and  usually that is the most important phenomenon.  Theemployment  cost index for the fourth  quarter could turn  out not to be  a blip.  We think itis, but we are not sure, of course.  I must say that  for three meetings  in  a row thecombined  comments  of the Reserve  Bank presidents  have scared  me.  They seem  to givea tighter tone than we get from looking  at the national  statistics.On the downside, there are  a lot of risks, many of which  have not been  mentionedso far.  Commodity prices  have been reasonably  well behaved,  gold prices  are pointingdown, term spreads indicate  stable prices, inflation  anticipations  are  turning down, and2/3-4/98utilization  rates  are not terribly threatening.  As far as I can tell,  a lot of the volatileprices  and exchange  rates in  Asia seem  to have  hit bottom.  What I think  a lot of you arereporting is not that the changes in exchange  rates and related prices aren't  going to havesignificant effects  but that they have  not been that significant yet.  I  think we probablywill see more Asian effects on the domestic  economy.  Another  risk is that  if inflationreally has dropped  to a slightly lower level,  we have a  higher real funds rate than  we hadbefore,  and this is  a non-trivial factor.  So, there are a  lot of risks on both sides.  It is hardto add them  up.  They are certainly in both directions in my view,  and  the weight on thedownside  may be a little bigger.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The year  1997 turned  out to be avery good year, no  matter how we look at it.  Output expanded.  The U.S. jobs  machinewas alive and well.  Salaries  and wages  recorded  real  growth.  A balanced federal  budgetcame  into in sight.  Overall inflation was  relatively well contained;  goods inflationappeared to be  about nonexistent, but inflation in the service  industries did persist atabout 3 percent.  I don't think the  1997  growth rate is  sustainable  and  strains  are startingto show.  Some  of the reports around the  table today have provided  examples  of laborshortages that now  appear to be  hampering  some kinds of investment activity.  Increasesin labor costs  show  signs of edging higher at least in some areas.  Although  increases incompensation  costs have been  offset by increases in  productivity,  it is questionable  as tohow long that process  can continue.  Since the U.S.  economy is  service-oriented  and costsare under pressure  in that  sector, it is hard to believe that aggregate  inflation will be held2/3-4/98at bay forever,  but the  indicators  are better  at least for the  near term, particularly  on thegoods  front.While  the U.S.  economy is  strong, Asia remains the  big unknown.  Had the Asiansituation  not occurred,  effectively  reducing the outlook for expansion in  the United  Statesand indeed perhaps world growth, I think something else would have  happened to slowthings  down. We could have  had a  stock market  correction.  Inflation could have heatedup.  Demand, particularly in  the labor markets, could have outstripped supply, and wecould have seen more of an increase in salaries  and  wages.  More  likely, preemptivemonetary policy would have  been  necessary.  It seems to me that the Asian crisis  issimply the trigger for the emergence  of a slowdown that was bound to happen.That leads to the next question, how much of a  slowdown will we get?  I findmyself more  optimistic than  the  staff in that I anticipate  a more  sustainable growth  rate of2-1/4  to 2-/2 percent  for  1998.  The fundamentals  that made  1997  so strong have not goneaway:  a strong  labor market  and a good climate for continued  investment--adequate  cashflow,  profits that  seem to be holding up  at least for now,  reasonably  low-cost capital,  andstrong balance  sheets.  Consumer spending  should also  hold up as long  as employment  issustained, and if the mortgage  refinancing boom continues, consumer spending shouldsupport economic  growth  in  1998,  or at least there  shouldn't be much of a  slowdown  inthe growth  of consumer spending.  I admit that Asia is likely to be  a decelerating  factor,but even Asia creates  some  crosscurrents  for U.S. economic  growth.In  sum, there clearly are  risks and they may have increased.  But unless the stockunanticipated  surprises,  the  expansion  should  slow to a more  moderate  growth  path in2/3-4/981998  with inflation contained in the near term.  If and when conditions  stabilize in Asia,inflationary pressures  are likely to resume  for all  of the traditional  reasons,  but it doesseem to me that the timing is pushed out for now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I understand  that the  role ofcentral  bankers  is,  in  fact, to take risks.  I was rather surprised  to learn that, coming as Idid from consulting  where  we took no risks.  But I am getting used  to this job.  Theeconomy,  as others have  said, clearly entered  1998 with  significant momentum.  Since  welast met, we have seen  a  number of indicators  of notable  strength  going forward.Examples include consumer confidence,  low long-term  interest rates  that make for a lowcost of capital, housing permits, and  something  no one has yet mentioned, the rise in realadjusted durable goods  orders.  So, a number  of factors point to strong  forwardmomentum.I will concur with what Governor Gramlich  had to say.  There  are also a numberof factors that suggest that inflation  pressures  may well diminish as  we go forward in1998.  These include  oil prices,  commodity prices,  inflation expectations,  and capacityutilization. In addition, there is obviously what I think is the least understood risk,  whichis the turbulence in Asia.  There we are getting a broad range  of signals.  The anecdotalevidence  suggests that developments  in Asia  are starting to produce  some slowdown  insome  U.S.  industries,  but I was  surprised to hear how few  presidents  came forward withmore  of those kinds of stories.  In  addition,  of course,  some have  indicated that thestarting to turn.  Before this year is over--it could be in March  or a little  later--we may2/3-4/98confront  some tougher policy choices.  I noticed that there is already  a bit of a split in theCommittee  about  the outlook.For now,  to  make this short, the economy is  strong, the impact  of Asia is unclear,and the risks are greater.  I happen  to think that there is  still greater upside than downsiderisk.  But in that environment,  I believe we  are  going to be  together as  risk takers,  and Iwould  encourage  us to  maintain a  vigilant,  maybe quite uncomfortable, waiting  attitude tosee exactly  what emerges  going forward.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent reportson the  Second District  economy point to steady growth.  That is an improvement  overrecent years.  Both the payroll  and household surveys  indicate  further tightening in  theDistrict's labor markets  in December and  in the fourth quarter  overall.  Payrollemployment  for New York  and New  Jersey combined grew  at an annual  rate  of 2-1/2percent  during the last three months of 1997.  That is  up from 2 percent  in the priorquarter.  Most  of the job gains  were concentrated in New Jersey  and downstate NewYork.On  the whole, post-Christmas  retail sales appear to be running roughly on plan,with inventories  generally at levels that are  satisfactory to store owners.  Unseasonablymild  weather across  most of the region has hurt sales  of cold weather  items and hascaused an inventory  overhang  of some  seasonal  merchandise.  The early January icestorm that spilled over from the First District and hit part of upstate New  York disruptedbusiness  during the first half of the month.  It is not clear yet what lasting effect thatstorm will have.2/3-4/98The housing markets  across  the region  appear to have gained  steam during  thefourth quarter, possibly assisted  by unseasonably  mild weather.  Housing  permits in  NewYork and New  Jersey, which had slipped below year-ago  levels  during the spring andsummer months,  rebounded in the fourth quarter,  and there was unusually  brisk activity inand availability  rates  across the metropolitan  New York area  continue  to decline.  Inmidtown Manhattan  the availability rate  fell from  10.7 to 9.1  percent,  and in our areadowntown the rate has tumbled from 18.9 to  15.5 percent.  Vacancy rates  are similarlylow in  suburban  areas.I spoke at some length  at the  last meeting about the possible dangers  coming fromthe Asian situation  and expressed the view  that the hoped-for continuation  of goodeconomic  performance  in the United States  and in the world in  general  depended on theAsian  situation at least not getting seriously  worse.  There  has been  some progress  in Asiain  that conditions  in both  South Korea and Thailand seem to be improving.  I don't thinkIndonesia  can be described  that way.  Japan, if anything, is perhaps  even  a greaterpotential problem  as their financial  and political  paralysis  seems to continue.We agree  at the New York Bank that the most likely forecast  is one  along the linesof that in the Greenbook.  We  see a slowing in growth during the first half of 1998 andsome subsequent  strengthening  to a growth path of about 2 to 2-1/4  percent.  However, weare somewhat  more concerned  about inflation  than the Greenbook.  That is largelybecause,  as we  continued to disaggregate  the ECI, we noted that the employment  costs forthose portions  of the service sector  of the  economy in which  there is no importcompetition  are rising rather significantly.  That is the  case not only in the fourth  quarter2/3-4/98but for about three  quarters in  a row,  and I think it is  something we have to watch  veryclosely.On balance, with the  Asian risk on one side and the  view that most of us have  thatthe  expansion will  slow in the first half on the  other, I think we  are in a very good  policyposition.  But I agree with a number of other speakers  that the Asian  situation could  makethings worse.  On  the other hand, the economy could be  stronger and this rather troublingincrease  in costs  in the  service sector, which basically is  not subject to importcompetition,  could  mean that we will have  a policy challenge  on the  upside as well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We're  coming down the  home stretchhere,  and I'm afraid I am going  to be quite repetitive,  but I will  press ahead briefly.Inflation,  of course,  is still  showing no signs of rearing  its ugly head  even as  the domesticeconomy rolls along strongly.  We had a  very strong fourth quarter and this quarter  looksstrong so far.  We surely are going to  get at least some  slowing from developments inAsia.  But as  I look for reasons to expect any slowing  from non-Asian  sources--in  otherwords for domestic  reasons--I find it quite  hard to uncover any,  and I would  be loathe topredict very much downside  from domestic  developments.  In  fact, it seems to me  that thedomestic  scenario is distinctly one  of upside  risk, although we certainly should not ignoreor forget the possible  downside shocks  that Governor Rivlin listed.Asia,  of course,  is the  major unknown of which  we are aware,  and it potentiallyskews the  risks in both directions in the following  sense.  I was  struck by the phrase  that awriter used in yesterday's  Financial  Times  when he observed that the Asian impact needsto be just right.  If it is, that's  going to  be really  good news.  In fact, that is exactly what  is2/3-4/98being predicted  by most observers  and indeed in the  staff projection  we looked  at a littleearlier.  If developments  in  Asia  slow the U.S.  economy just enough  but not too much,that would be a very nice  outcome.  But if that assessment  is  wrong, the risks couldcertainly be skewed in  either direction.  If the Asian  impact is meaningfully  stronger thanprojected  through  metastasizing  to other countries or for whatever other reason, then itobviously  could cause  a downside jolt that the Fed might need to respond to.Alternatively,  if the  impact turns out to be meaningfully  weaker  and the crisiseither is or for some time  appears to be  contained and its effects  rather modest, that thenopens the door to the high probability of a strong run by an  already buoyant  Americaneconomy.  In that case,  our longstanding  upside concerns  may very well  be realized andwe might  have to respond.  So, which  way will it go?  Will it be about  right, stronger, orweaker?  I think we're going to have  to wait and  see,  and meanwhile,  once  again,  steadyas she goes.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Not a lot has changed  since  the lastmeeting to affect my assessment of the near-term outlook.  The key forces  at work remainclear.  These are the tug of war between  the momentum in domestic  demand and theexpected external  drag  from Asia and the tug of war between  very  tight labor markets  andthe forces that have  restrained and appear likely to continue to restrain inflation.  Butthere  is,  as  nearly everyone  has  said today,  a great  deal of uncertainty  about how  thesepowerful  forces will play out, particularly  with regard to the uncertain  dimension of thestill  evolving  crisis in Asia.  It seems  to me, therefore,  that there  is  not much for us  to dofor a while but to wait and see precisely how these  crosscurrents  balance out.2/3-4/98Relative to  the  Greenbook forecast, I would expect  slightly stronger  growth thisyear, with the expansion  slowing  down a little less to a pace close to 2 percent,  andslightly higher inflation.  I think my forecast  is qualitatively  in the same  spirit as theGreenbook.Given the crosscurrents  and related uncertainties,  a variety of outcomes  couldchallenge  monetary policy in coming quarters.  I want to comment on two.  One of themcould easily come into play almost immediately  and a second  might arise  later this yearand into next year.  Perhaps  the  most important question  that  we may have to confront inthe near term is how long we can afford to wait for the effect of the spillover from Asia toslow growth  to or below  trend.  This question  is highlighted by the stronger-than-expected performance  of the economy in the fourth quarter, including the  somewhat morefavorable  than anticipated mix between final  demand and inventory investment,  and isalso  highlighted by the upward revision to the Greenbook  forecast for the  first quarter.The prospect  for further strong  employment gains  and a further tightening in  laborhow much  further tightening in labor markets  we are  prepared to tolerate without someresponse.  The good news is that the initial conditions  afford us the luxury of waiting,assuming  at least that we do not have  to wait much beyond  the first quarter to observe  aslowdown  in growth  toward trend.  Because it appears that inflation  is likely to remain incheck in the near term despite  tight labor markets, there may be room to wait out someresidual  above trend growth,  provided the forecast  continues to point toward  slowergrowth  ahead.2/3-4/98My greater  concern,  however, is  the forecast  for inflation  in  1999  and beyond.While this  does not bear directly on our decision  today, it highlights  a transition that wewill have to make and one  that might reasonably  affect  the way we  respond todevelopments  over this year.  The relevant issues are  effectively highlighted in thelonger-term  simulations  reported in the Bluebook.  In those  simulations,  a combination  oftight labor markets  and dissipation  and reversal  of some of the forces  that recently havebeen restraining inflation  finally begin  to put upward  pressure  on inflation into  1999 andbeyond.  One of the alternative  longer-term  scenarios in the Bluebook involves  atightening  to prevent  the persistent  updrift in inflation.  We may want to keep thisscenario  in mind if growth slows  to below trend or the unemployment  rate edges upwardas in the staff forecast.  The transition  ahead may require either  such a period  of belowtrend growth  or  a tightening  of monetary policy, and maybe  both.

MR. RIVES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions  in the EighthDistrict are consistent with full employment  of the region's economic  resources.  Districtlabor markets remain  very tight, with measured  unemployment rates  showing  noindication  of departing  from their lowest  levels in  20 years.  The diminished pool ofqualified labor continues to temper employment  gains in the District relative to those seennationwide.  Labor inflows  from other regions  do not appear sufficient  to meet thedemands  of firms engaged  in the current robust business expansion.  Despite  thesecaveats,  reasonably  strong employment  gains persist in many manufacturing  sectors  andto a lesser extent in construction,  especially nonresidential  building activity.  In  someareas, increased  wage pressures  are accompanying  the tight  labor markets.  A District2/3-4/98executive  in the  health  care  field suggested  that further productivity  gains in that industryare  unlikely in the near term.On  balance,  Asian market turmoil  does  not appear to  be exerting a serious drag onthe District's economic  activity.  Recent  discussions  with business  contacts in  the Districtindicated  that while  some industries  have seen  appreciable disruptions,  others havebenefited from  lower costs that foreign-based  suppliers  can  pass  along.  Some agriculturalprices have  declined sharply  in response  to the Asian situation.  On net, the effect  oneconomic  activity  in the District appears  to have been minimal and absent a dramaticdeterioration  of conditions in Asia,  the effect  should remain muted.Even in the face  of diminishing labor pools and disrupted  foreign markets, Districtmanufacturers  remain  optimistic  for 1998.  Orders  appear  to be holding firm, and so  farthere have been  no broad-based  adverse  inventory  shifts.  Likewise,  consumers  appear tohave  perked up recently.  Initial District  reports suggested  that retail  sales increasedbetween  2 and 3  percent on  average during the  1997  holiday  season over  a year earlier,but those increases  may be somewhat  understated  in view  of post-holiday  sales  strength.As long  as income  and employment  gains remain  solid,  there is little reason  to questionthe forecasts  of retailers  who  are expecting  moderate  to strong sales during  the  currentquarter.I will  not repeat the indicators relating  to the nation's economy that have  beenmentioned, but  the national  economy  in our view is  entering  1998  with substantialmomentum.  The economy  appears  very robust  and shows few  signs  of slowing.  As  aresult, the Eighth District forecast  is on the  high end of the range  of the members'forecasts  for nominal  and real  GDP growth  and  on the low end of the range  for the2/3-4/98 78unemployment  rate.  Considering the environment  in which  recent inflation gains havebeen  achieved,  we may be testing the bottom on  inflation,  with most of the future  riskremaining on  the upside.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We will  now  turn to a discussion  of the long-runranges  for the monetary  aggregates,  and I will call  on Dave Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  The Committee  was  given some  colorful charts  yesterday,but  today I will be referring to the colorless  charts  entitled,  "Material  for StaffPresentation  on Long-Run Ranges."  3/The first page  of your handout reproduces  the table on page  11  of the Bluebookexcept for a revision  to the  M2  and M3  growth  rates for 1997  in the first column.The  receipt  of new  data from the Investment  Company  Institute on the IRAcomponent  of retail money market mutual  funds  in the  second  and third quartersof last year  has caused  us  to revise  upward the annual growth  rates  for M2  and M3by 0.3 percentage  point each.  Thus, the revisions place  M2  growth  somewhatabove the 5  percent upper  bound of its range for last year and M3  growth  evenfurther above  its 6 percent  upper bound.The second  column shows staff forecasts for money,  credit,  and nominal  GDPthis year.  Nominal  GDP and M2  are  both expected to grow  at annual rates  of 3-1/2percent,  which  represents  quite a slowdown  for both measures.  The Committee'sown central tendency for nominal GDP  has a midpoint  a bit above 4 percent,implying  a somewhat  faster rate  of M2 growth  than the staff foresees  this year,assuming flat V2.  The lower panel of the next chart, also revised from theBluebook, puts the implied prediction  of a flat  V2 over  1998 in the perspective  ofthe experience  of recent  years.  Despite the uptrend of V2 from mid-1994  tomid-1997,  we expect the pattern  of little velocity change  that held late last  year topersist through this  year.  The  steady funds  rate assumed in the  Greenbookforecast  implies  that the opportunity  cost of M2  will  change  little.  We alsobelieve  that the sogginess  of stock prices in the staff forecast  will divert  someinflows from  stock mutual  funds to M2 assets, with  their stable principal,  therebyshort-circuiting  any renewed updrift in  V2.  With  that outcome, the  behavior  ofV2 this year  would parallel  its  performance  during  the three decades  prior to the1990s  shown by the dots  surrounding the regression  line in the upper panel  of thischart.  Over that period, the velocity of M2 was  relatively stable  unless theopportunity cost of holding M2  balances  varied.Your next chart shows  our forecast of a sharp decline in  M3  velocity this  yearthat follows  from the staff's projection  of 6-3/4 percent growth  of M3.  At morethan a  3  percent  annual  rate of decline,  the line this year is not only  steeper than3/  Copies of the charts used  by Mr. Lindsey are appended  to  the transcript.  (Appendix  3)2/3-4/98the  nearly  1 percent  trend  rate of decline over the three decades  prior to the  1990sbut it is also  steeper than  the 2 percent average  rate of contraction  over the threeprior years.  The staff foresees rapid M3  growth  relative to thatof nominal  GDP this year, in part because  businesses should continue to find theinstitution-only  money fund component  of M3  an attractive  cash managementtool.  More  important, depository institutions  will need appreciable  M3-typefunding to finance lending if they are to maintain their share of relatively  rapiddebt growth.Our projection is that the growth  of the debt of domestic nonfinancial  sectors,at 5-1/4  percent,  also will exceed that  of nominal GDP by a  sizable margin.  Hence,projected debt velocity,  as shown  in  the lower panel  of this chart, falls this year atalmost  a 2 percent pace.  As may be seen  in this panel,  apart from the exceptionaldrop in  debt velocity  during the  1980s,  this ratio has  evinced little trend  since  theearly  1960s.  The  fall in debt velocity this year mostly reflects larger businessborrowing  necessitated  by flagging  corporate  earnings  and greater merger-relatedretirements  of equity.Turning back to  the  table, three alternative  sets of ranges  are presented forCommittee consideration.  Alternative  I retains the provisional  specifications  thatthe Committee  chose  last July.  In  recent years, the FOMC  has not interpreted theranges  for broad money as  suggestive of its expectations  for growth  over the yearor two covered by the  ranges.  Instead, because  of continued heighteneduncertainty  about the demand  for broad  money, the Committee  has interpreted  theranges  as being consistent  with  the trend of money growth under conditions  ofprice  stability.  With true price stability,  nominal GDP would grow  at a rate  ofaround 3 percent each year; that increase is  composed of measured potential  realgrowth  of 2-1/2 percent  and an  upward bias in the GDP price  index  of a bit morethan  1/2 percentage  point.  If V2  were flat and V3  were  to trend down by  1 percentas was  the case  in the three decades  prior to the  1990s,  then the midpoints  of theprovisional  ranges of alternative I would match  the expected  growth  of M2 andM3 under price  stability.The FOMC has interpreted the  3 to  7 percent debt range of alternative  Idifferently than the ranges for the monetary aggregates.  The  Committee  hasintended the debt range to  encompass the  likely growth of debt over the year inquestion.  The actual  growth  rates  of debt over the last three years,  in fact, turnedout fairly close to the 5  percent midpoint  of this range.  This 5 percent  midpoint,however,  would be  too  high to characterize  our expectation for trend debt growthunder conditions  of price stability.  As we  have seen, debt velocity  has tended  tostay  about  constant,  apart from its decline  during the unusual  decade  of the  1980s.Alternative  III in the table adjusts the debt range down  to 2 to 6 percent,  matchingthe provisional M3  range  and  in effect moving the rationale  for the  debt rangecloser to one  consistent with trend  debt growth  over time under conditions  of2/3-4/98price  stability.  Under alternative  II,  all three ranges  would be  roughly consistentwith price stability.Because the staff projects  a step-up of debt growth from 4-1/2  percent last yearto 5-1/4 percent this year, though, the  Committee may not consider  1998 to be anauspicious year to harmonize the rationale  for the debt range with that of bothbroad monetary  aggregates.  If the Committee  chooses to leave the debt range andits rationale unchanged  at this meeting, it may wish to consider  alternative  II.This  alternative encompasses  the  expected growth  this year  of all three  aggregates.Thus,  it makes  the rationale  for M3 more like  the familiar one  for debt in theprovisional  ranges.  It raises the  M3  range to 3 to 7  percent, so that the upper endis above the  staff's projection of 6-3/4  percent M3  growth this year.  Of course,raising the M3  range even  more, say to 4 to 8 percent,  would come even closer tocentering the range around  expected  M3  growth for this year.  But such  a movewould depart even further from the specified  range for trend M3 growth consistentwith price stability,  making it even more wrenching  in some future  year to returnto a price stability rationale for the M3  range.I should add in concluding that the staff remains somewhat  uncertain  about itsprojections  of the broad money aggregates  relative to nominal GDP.  M3,  inparticular, has shown  itself to be  subject to unpredictable  surges  or sluggishness inits non-M2 component.  This behavior  has resulted from changes  in bank relianceon large time deposits, which are included  in M3,  versus borrowing funds fromforeign offices, which  are  outside M3.  Even M2 velocity behavior  may not havereturned  all the way to normal.  Specifically,  the  staff is still unsure whether  anysignificant uptrend of V2 independent  of the opportunity cost of holding M2balances will resume in the  years ahead as financial  innovations or perceptions  ofattractive returns  lead households to diversify further their savings  away from  M2balances.  Any such uptrend is unlikely  to be  of the dimensions  of the  shift in theearly  1990s, but the possibility  of continued shifts in money holders'  portfoliopreferences  makes  projecting the future behavior of V2 still error prone.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I am looking at the  lower frame of Chart 6.  Itillustrates  clearly the independent  rise in V2  at any given opportunity  cost, because theopportunity cost has not moved very much.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  On balance,  it has not; that's  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The behavior of V2 since  mid-1994 had suggestedto us earlier that the relationship of V2 to  opportunity cost was moving back to itsprevious  pattern in the period from 1959  through  1989.  Does the more recent pattern2/3-4/98alter that view or merely emphasize  that even this  shift back,  so to speak, has meaningonly in the context  of a further secular updrift of the trend in V2?

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  That is  the open  question.  It is true that we think the  velocity ofM2 since  mid-1994  has moved more closely to its behavior  over the three decades  priorto the  1990s.  However, it also is true--and we  sent the FOMC  a memo  to this effect--thatwe can fit an equation  with only M2 velocity,  opportunity cost,  and a time trend frommid-1994 to mid-1997  that gives  an annual  growth  trend of 1-1/4  percentage points.  Wecertainly  do not see that uptrend in the last part  of 1997, as one  can  see from the chart, nordo we foresee  such an uptrend going forward because  as I mentioned  in my briefing, weanticipate  some  weakening  in stock prices  in 1998.  The latter should, as I said,short-circuit  some residual trend toward increasing  velocity.  However,  we are somewhatunsure of what the future holds in store.  It is true  that we have estimated  a model  overthis whole  period that in the early  1990s  has velocity change  starting to move  in a gradual"S"  pattern.  This model fits recent  years better than any of our other models.  It suggeststhat the residual  uptrend of V2 in  1998 will be only about 0.2 percentage  point, virtuallyzero,  and that it will move down to 0.1  percentage  point in  1999.  So, to the extent webelieve the "S"  pattern  indicates  that the updrift in velocity is gradually coming to an end,we  would not anticipate much  of an  uptrend in velocity  going forward.  Whether one canbelieve that is, as I say, an open question.  Personally, I  feel fairly uncertain  about thebehavior of V2 going forward,  but having said that, I certainly feel more secure  than I didas we went through the early  1990s and observed  that extreme  updrift.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  You mentioned the stock  market  as being  thereason  for bringing down V2  through  the forecast  period, other things equal.  Have you2/3-4/98tried to put stock prices  in  as an  additional  variable  in your model  to see if anythinghappens?

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  We have  estimated a variety  of M2+ and M3+  models in aneffort to capture the non-M2  or non-M3  components  of those broader measures.  We havehad some  success  but not a  perfect success.  One  issue is that inflows to stock mutualfunds were negatively  correlated with inflows to M2 until the last two years.  Inflows toboth M2 and stock mutual  funds subsequently increased  to fairly rapid rates,  so  theybecame positively correlated.  It could be pointed out that spending  also was strong,tending to provide  a third reason for that positive correlation.  I would not say  we wereentirely  successful  in our efforts to construct models that  capture well the behavior ofM2+  or M3+.  I would be interested  in Don Kohn's  view of that,  though.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  In a technical  memo that was circulated  some six months  ago,  weput in  stock and bond mutual  funds, and we came  away at that time with  some sense  thatwhen the  growth  of those  funds was  strong, M2 was weak.  So, that result gave us a littleconfirmation  of a tradeoff.  Recently,  I saw  a chart that suggested  the two  had becomemore  positively correlated.  For example,  stock mutual fund flows were extremely  strongin the second half of last year;  M2 also was strong.  But income  growth  likewise  wasvery strong, so the  economy was generating a lot  of savings that were allocated to both.  Istill  think some of the  evidence  points to a bit of a tradeoff there,  but we do not feel  veryconfident that we have  pinned down  the substitution  between  capital market mutual  fundsand M2.2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  When  we normalize M2,  stock mutual funds,  andstock market prices by consumption  or income or some  parameter of that nature, does  thesign reverse  on the relationship between  M2 and mutual  funds?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  The original  equation of a year or so ago had income in it, soincome was being taken into account.  I don't know about the more recent modelingexperience.  As  I noted, the chart that I  saw suggested  that the two recently  had tended tomove together,  but I don't know whether income was held constant  in the model.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Expressing them  as ratios to income orconsumption is not the same  thing as regressions  that include  those variables.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  It is a different  form.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It should be if it isn't.  Further  questions for David?

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Can I be forgiven  a rookie question?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Those are the  unanswerable questions.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  All these Bluebook ranges  are four percentage  points wide.  Isthat writ on a  stone tablet somewhere?  It strikes  me that with all  the financialuncertainties  and the institutional  changes that are  occurring in the financial  markets, it isvery hard to pin these relationships  down  whether one  uses "S"  curves or whatever.Where do the four-point  widths come from?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That, of course, is a matter that gets decided  by this Committee.The historical  precedent  is that the ranges through  1987  were three percentage pointswide and the Committee raised them to four in  1988.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  So,  now we  are in  1998  and might it go to five?  [Laughter]2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  When it was widened,  Governor Gramlich,  it was as a  result ofsome  increasing uncertainty  about what demand for M2 would be consistent  with theCommittee's expectations  for nominal  GDP over the coming  year, especially  since M2does  retain considerable response to opportunity  costs.  At the beginning  of 1988,  theCommittee  did not know  whether  interest rates  would be rising or falling.  The memberswere  a little uncertain  about the position  of the demand curve as well.  In  order to havethe ranges reflect both uncertainties,  interest rates  and position of the demand  curve, theywidened them to four percentage points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions?  Who  would like to start theCommittee  discussion?  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Whenever  we talk about the monetary  aggregate  ranges,  it seemsto me we are always  caught between two kinds of decisions:  whether we  want to confirmor change  the interpretation  we give  to the  ranges and what boundaries  we want to set.The staff presentation  today reminds  us that the ranges  are set inconsistently  in terms oftheir interpretation,  and we have  an opportunity  to make  them more consistent.  M2 andM3  are set according  to what I call a  "price  stability"  rationale, one that  is consistent withprice stability and normal  velocity behavior, and debt is  set according  to what I call  a"projections"  interpretation.It seems  to me that the principle of consistency  has  some value here.  I think theranges should be  set consistently  with one  another.  We  could argue as  to whether  the"price stability"  or the "projections"  interpretation  is the  one we want to use.  In my view,the choice between  those two involves  two principles.  One I call convenience.  As  longas there is  a lot of uncertainty  or projected  potential  instability in the  aggregates,  the2/3-4/98"price  stability"  interpretation  is rather convenient.  The other principle is consistencywith Humphrey-Hawkins,  or the  spirit of Humphrey-Hawkins,  and that would make melean  toward the  "projections"  interpretation.In the midst of concern  about the instability  of the monetary aggregates,  I amcomfortable  with the "price stability"  rationale  until stability  emerges  long enough for usto move back to a "projections"  interpretation.  Given that,  I prefer the spirit of alternativeIII. In particular, I cannot think of a good rationale  for alternative  II because  all it does ischange  which aggregate  is inconsistent  with the other two.  Now,  while I like alternativeIII in principle, I do  not think the timing for moving  to that alternative is particularlygood.  On  the  one hand,  we would be lowering  our target range for debt and raising  ourforecast  of its growth.  On  the other, we would be drawing attention to the monetaryaggregates  at a time when  we do not necessarily  want to signal  that we are  going to placemore  emphasis  on them.  So, I would prefer to retain  alternative  I, and  as the growth rateprojections for the debt aggregate  decline over time  and become  more consistent with the"price stability"  rationale--if that  should occur--we  could then lower the debt range andchange  its interpretation,  too.One other observation  that I would bring up relates to the ranges  for the M2aggregate.  The  staff has made  a very good point that the M2 range  seems to be almostperfectly centered  on virtual price  stability.  It  implies a 1/2  percent increase  in  inflation.So,  it might be  said that,  by voting for alternative  I,  we are saying that price  stability isindeed our long-run  inflation  target and is  what we  intend to achieve.  I want to comeback to that issue  in my  policy position statement,  but I do not want my preference foralternative  I necessarily  to carry that implication.2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  On the  ranges,  I think  the main thing we need to do is toleave  the M2 range where  it is  today at  1 to 5  percent.  That would serve  both as  a signalof our continuing commitment  to price  stability and  operationally as a likely  rate of M2growth that would be consistent  with maintaining  the low inflation  environment  we arenow enjoying.  All three alternatives have  a  1 to 5  percent range for M2,  so I am relativelyindifferent  among them.  In this regard, it is worth  noting, as Dave Lindsey  indicated, thatthere is some evidence that the  standard M2 demand equation  is coming back on track.So, at least some case can  be made  for giving  M2 a little more weight.  I recognize theuncertainties that  are involved, but I believe a  little more weight to M2 would bedesirable  in our deliberations  going forward.  In that context,  it seems worth noting that ifin fact M2 is coming back on track with  little or no velocity  trend, the annual  rate of M2growth close to 7  percent that we have  seen recently is clearly inconsistent withmaintaining  the progress  we have made in  reducing inflation.At our Humphrey-Hawkins  meeting  in July of last year, I made my usual plea, Mr.Chairman,  that we consider setting, one way or another, an explicit  or at least a somewhatmore concrete  and precise longer-term  inflation  objective.  A couple of recentdevelopments  make me want to put that issue back on the  table and I will try to do sovery briefly.  First, we are  very close to price  stability right now--candidly,  a lot closerthan I thought  last year or maybe a  year and a half ago we would be at this time.  With themeasured CPI currently around  2 percent and  with an upward bias  of around  1 percent,the true underlying rate of inflation  may now be at 1 percent  or perhaps  a  little higher.That  has a couple  of implications as I see it.  One is that we no  longer need to get hung up2/3-4/98on the topic of the transition costs  of moving back  to price  stability.  We  are already thereessentially.  I think that is  a powerful  argument for trying to lock in price  stability byannouncing  a somewhat  more specific  inflation  objective.  Also, with inflation as low asit is currently, the public  has become more aware  of and  more concerned  about deflation.For obvious and understandable  reasons,  there has been much  more public  commentabout deflation  recently  than in the past.  In effect,  one might  say we recently  have gonethrough a  mini-deflation  scare.  In the current low  inflation environment, it seems  to methat  our longer-term  policy strategy  now needs  to address deflation  concerns  as well asinflation  concerns.For that reason, I believe we should consider  stating explicitly  a lower bound forour longer-term inflation objective.  It could be  zero on an  accurate price  index or maybe1 percent or so on the actual measured  CPI.  We would explain how we would  avoidgoing  below that lower bound.  If we did that, I think it would help to clarify our strategyfor situations that have  begun to receive  some  attention very recently but that,understandably, had not previously received a lot of attention for four or five  decades.  Inmy view,  that could help  us avoid getting into the kind of situation  the Japanese  havefound themselves in from time to time in recent years.  Of course,  if we  announce  alower bound  on inflation, then it would make  sense for us to announce  simultaneously  anexplicit  upper bound as well.  It might be  in the neighborhood of 3 percent on themeasured CPI.  Even economists who think that some inflation  is desirable  for one reasonor another generally  agree that inflation  over 3  percent or so is excessive.  In any event,  ifwe did set  a lower bound, I believe we would have to set an upper bound because  if we2/3-4/98did not, we would  invite credibility problems.  That is one reason  for giving strongconsideration  to an upper  inflation  limit today.Very  briefly, the other consideration  that I believe  strengthens  the case for a moreconcrete inflation  objective, and  broadens  it incidentally to  include a Congressionalmandate for price  stability, is recent fiscal  developments.  We all know that there aremajor fiscal  challenges  still facing the nation  in the long run.  But for now, it strikes methat the members  of Congress  on both sides  of the aisle are very proud of theirachievement  in balancing  the budget, whatever the true underlying economic forcesproducing that balance  may be.  They feel that they have  accomplished  their longer-termstrategic economic  objective,  the equivalent for them of our price  stability objective.  So,the  stars may be in  the right place for a change,  and with a little push it might  be possibleto persuade  Congress to give us some longer-term  guiding principles  for monetary policy.I would urge you, Mr. Chairman, to consider making a pitch in your upcoming testimonyfor a Congressional  mandate,  as you have in the past.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I basically  agree with the points made by GovernorMeyer and would favor alternative I.  It seems  to me that the reasons  for not changing theranges that we have cited in the past, some of which  Governor Meyer mentioned, areapplicable  today.  Eventually,  it will make  some sense to go to what is  shown asalternative III, but in  view  of the fact that  debt is projected to increase at a faster rate in1998  than it did in  1997,  I don't think this is the best time to make that change.

I am not attracted  to alternative  II, but I feel  a lot ofattraction to alternative  III because  of the consistency  of its ranges  in terms  of theirinterpretation  and their consistency  with price  level  stability.  But I agree with GovernorMeyer that this probably is  an unwise time to move to that alternative.  So, I would preferto  stay with alternative I and look for an opportunity  to go to alternative III,  or whateverthe alternative  III numbers  might be when  we are prepared  to make  that move.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I also prefer alternative  I.  It  is interesting to observe  that M2growth is coming into closer alignment  with the Committee's  goal of price stability.  Icould at some  point live with  alternative III for many of the reasons  that Governor  Meyerstated.  At this point, no change would be needed in the M2 and M3 ranges  and the lowerrange for debt in this alternative  would give  us a consistent interpretation  of the threeranges.  My memory of how we  got to alternative  I is not quite the one that has beensuggested.  I don't think we were thinking in terms of inconsistency when the currentranges  were set.  As  I recall, it was  more that monetary  growth was  falling considerably.I have agreed  with keeping  the M2 and M3 ranges consistent with price  stability duringthe  intervening  years, and I think that retaining alternative  I is appropriate for now.  But atsome point  we will want to contemplate  moving toward alternative  III.

MS.  MINEHAN.  Governor Meyer  did some of us a big favor by articulating  atthe outset  all the good reasons to stay with alternative  I, and I agree  with  him on that.  Iam attracted  to alternative  III, but for now I would  like to leave the ranges  alone and  notdraw  any further attention  to the  aggregates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  I am going to sound  very similar.  I prefer  alternative  III in  orderto bring the ranges into a consistent  formulation, but given  the uncertainties  surroundingthe M2 and M3  forecasts,  I can very easily accept alternative  I as well.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Despite the  enormous ingenuity of the  staff, I don't think weunderstand these M relationships  very well at all.  My guess is that  our understanding  willnot get  much better.  We may get some comforting returns for a  while to somerelationships with  which we  are familiar, but that might not last.  I think the optimumposition  would be to tell the Congress  honestly that we  don't understand the Ms  verywell.  We do not, in fact, discuss monetary policy in  terms of the Ms  between Humphrey-Hawkins meetings.  Don Kohn dutifully  mentions  them because  he thinks he ought to,  butthat is not the way we think about monetary policy.  I don't think we want to take on  thatcrusade  at the moment.  For that reason,  I would stay with alternative  I because I think itwill involve the least complicated discussion with  the Congress  about why we areadopting particular ranges.  I don't think we have  a good rationale  for changing them,although moving  to a consistent set of ranges would be  rather nice.  But if I had mydruthers  I would be consistent in not talking about  the Ms at all.

MR.  BOEHNE.  I support  alternative I largely  for the reasons  articulated byGovernor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I have been  waiting for somebody  to say something I agreedwith  [laughter],  and I think Governor Rivlin  got closest.  I could certainly go withalternative I for now if we do not want to attract attention to the aggregates.  But if we arelooking  to make  a change  somewhere,  my preference would be  to go in the  direction of2/3-4/98deemphasizing  these ranges.  Absent that,  we  might widen them to reflect more clearlyour view  that there is a great deal  of uncertainty about  these  ranges.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Humphrey-Hawkins  statutorily  requires  that we setmonetary ranges.  Now, I don't think we  would be put in jail  if we stopped  doing it, butthe law is the law.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I cannot tell  the difference  between any of these  alternativeseither in  the way the  Committee operates  or in  the way we communicate  with the public.I believe we should start to articulate  a view as to what monetary  policy is  all about quiteaside from the prices  of goods  and other  assets denominated  in units of money.  Ourobjective has never been  to stabilize or target or control  any of those things but rather tofocus on the prices  of items that people buy that are  denominated in units of money.  Wehave used various  monetary aggregates  as a  benchmark of whether policy was roughly inthe  acceptable zone,  or a constellation of financial  variables  that gave  us some  sense ofthat.  I think that once we approach  something that most people would consider  to beclose to price  stability, an  expression I do not like  at all,  these ranges  do not serve  us well.To the extent that it provides any  guidance  in communicating  with the public, Ithink M2 is the only aggregate  that is at all useful  and I would not change its range.  Iwould leave  it at 1 to 5  percent, but I don't think that is going far enough.  We do notwant to stabilize prices.  We want all prices  to be changing  all over the lot all the time,especially prices of certain things  that should  be going  down, like computers.  Prices ofother things, like tickets to Cleveland Indians  baseball  games, we know are  always  goingto go up.  We want people to conduct  their daily household  and business affairs  in  theexpectation that, roughly  weighted in their minds, the prices of things that are  going upare matched  by the  prices of things that are  going down and the purchasing  power ofmoney is stable.  I do not see that M3  or debt is at all useful  in communicating  thatobjective.  M2 gets the closest to it but it is  not satisfactory.  The one change  I wouldmake for 1998  versus  1997  is that we not only announce a range but that we mean it.2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think that  we are  not looking at price stability perse  as  a goal because  prices at the end of the day are not that clearly measurable.  What wereally  are endeavoring to do  is to reduce the implicit anticipated  change in  the purchasingpower of money that imbeds itself in  long-term nominal  interest rates.  We  are trying toextract and stabilize  that component  of long-term rates  because  if we can do that, I thinkwe can demonstrate that it will  create  the lowest level of instability in the economicsystem and the position in  which money plays its maximum role for economic  growth.So, it may be that the problem down the road will not be that  of following money;  it maybe our great difficulty in  determining  how to measure  it.  We have had to measureunrelated  supply variables,  and it is interesting that as  we get an increasing  proportion ofGDP composed of palpable  intellectual products  versus specifically high-tech products,the convention  by which we  define  output has created significant price  declines.  What dowe really mean by those  prices  and do we have any interest in stabilizing  them per se?  Tocarry Governor Rivlin's view further, the difficulty I think we  are running  up against andindeed the problems we have been  having for the last number of years are likely aconsequence  of the major changes  in technology  that are  fundamentally undercutting  ournotion of the supply  of money, not in a real  sense but in the way we  measure  it.  It  may bethat we can find some way to track the true prospective change in the purchasing  powerof money, whatever  that term means to people,  as it deposits  itself in  long-term  interestrates.  That should be the Humphrey-Hawkins  variable.  The problem  is that we do  nothave a clue as to  what that number is;  it is  not something  that we  can explicitly measure.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I would like to follow  up for just a moment because there are  twothings  along that line that we do know  as economists,  even if we are  not able to2/3-4/98communicate  that knowledge effectively to the Congress,  let alone to the  public at large.Our theories  tell us  that if we have  a world in which the purchasing power of money isstable, then  all changes  in nominal  interest rates are simultaneously  changes in realinterest rates.  We have  a  fully anticipated  world.  Second,  when there are changes  in theprices of things that people buy and  sell,  goods as well as assets and various services,those changes  in prices  denominated  in units  of money are  relative price changes.  If theprice of something  goes up by  10 percent  and people think of that  as being partly achange in the purchasing power of money and partly a  change in relative prices, we arenot there.  If they can take  the percentage  change  in the price of something  as beingtotally a relative price change,  we have  achieved  a condition  of stable purchasing  powerof money.  That means that price increases  are  matched by price  declines of such items ascomputers  and digital watches.  Stability  in the purchasing power of money is  ultimatelythe benchmark by which  our policy is going  to be judged.  If people  conduct their affairsin the belief that the purchasing power of money, real income,  and wealth  change asprices change,  then we have not fulfilled our objective.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  If we cannot explain to the Americanpeople in understandable  words,  and not very many of them, what it is that we are tryingto achieve,  then we are  not carrying  out our function to create public  policy as servants ofthe people.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Four or five years ago, I began  to think thata target range for  some version of the CPI had the merit that  it could be explained  and itwould be understandable.  But as  time  has gone on,  I have come to believe that that doesnot work.  That does  not meet the  very understandable  verbal  definition of price  stabilitythat you invented  some years ago, namely that we have  price stability when people  are nottaking inflation  into consideration  when they make either their investment or household

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is in  fact what Jerry  Jordan is talking  about.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I agree.  But I wouldn't worry aboutfiguring  out some new, very  erudite way to express price  stability because  we alreadyhave the  way to express it and it works beautifully.  I think it is something  we ought tostick to.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  May I make  a comment?  I agree  that  it is  a wonderfuldefinition,  and I think it has  served  us well.  The problem  is that the concept  is difficult tocommunicate  to the public.  When  the public thinks about the price level,  it thinks  aboutthe CPI and similar measures.  That's why I think we could  strengthen our position  if weused some kind of explicit guidepost  related to that key number.  It is the number thatmost of the American  people associate with this phenomenon.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Could I add  a point?  It is not just our ability to communicate  tothe  public, it is our own internal deliberations  that  are at stake  here.  We might  ask wherewe are  heading.  Do we think we are where  we want to be or do we  think we wantinflation  to move  down  1/2  percentage  point,  1 percentage  point,  1-1/2  percentage  points?This vague  definition was  perfectly adequate  when inflation  was  10 percent,  and it2/3-4/98worked  when inflation  was  5  percent, but now I think there is a real question--maybeamong  us and certainly among  the public  at  large.  There is an issue  here.

MR.  BERNARD.  This  wording is from page 21  in the Bluebook.

In furtherance  of these objectives,  the Committeeat  this meeting  established ranges for growth of M2 and M3  of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to  6percent respectively,  measured  from the fourth  quarter  of 1997  to the fourth  quarter of1998.  The range for growth  of total domestic  nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7  percentfor the year.  The behavior of the monetary  aggregates  will continue  to be evaluated in thelight of progress  toward price level  stability, movements  in their velocities,  anddevelopments  in the economy and  financial  markets."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Shall we move on to current  monetarypolicy?  I will call on Don Kohn.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I will provide you with some moreimpalpable, intellectual  product that you probably  would pay me not to give you.[Laughter]  I will spend a few minutes  discussing the long-run scenarios  in theBluebook and use them  as  a lead-in  to a discussion  of the stance of policy.The Bluebook  simulations  examine  the implications of the  staff Greenbookforecast  beyond  1999  and look at a few of the forces that could cause the economyto  deviate from that baseline.  In that risk assessment,  we chose perturbations tothe international  and  productivity  assumptions underlying  the staff forecast.  Thatis not  only because  those  are the  areas where  everyone is most uncertain,  but alsobecause  earlier changes  on both these fronts  have been  important in the baselineforecast.  For that reason, the simulations  can illuminate  key characteristics  of thebaseline  forecast.The alternative international  developments  were modeled as a prolonged Asianshock--that is,  a recovery  of the Asian economies  that begins much  later thanassumed in the  Greenbook--reflecting  the risks that structural problems  may beless tractable,  or the political  will to deal  with them more ephemeral,  thanassumed.  Greater weakness  in  Asian  economies in the out years is transmitted tous in part through  a stronger dollar, in much the same manner  as are the currentAsian  problems that are already built into the baseline.  In  some respects,  thissimulation  also mimics the effects  on the U.S.  economy in the baseline of thesubstantial  rise of the dollar before  the Asian crisis  hit, though  that rise reflectedstrength  at home  as well as weakness abroad.Similarly,  the productivity  shock--one  percentage  point faster growth than inthe baseline--may  pinpoint  some of the effects of the apparent pickup  inproductivity  already being felt in  the economy.  Last year, the staff raised itsestimate  of trend productivity  by 1/4 percentage  point,  and some  of you havevoiced suspicions that the gains may be  more.The "shocks"  are  alike  in one important  respect:  Both involve favorablesupply developments  that put downward  pressure on prices  at any level of output,through  lower import prices  in  one case and lower  unit labor costs in the other.Consequently,  in  both cases, the unemployment  rate can run  below the NAIRU fora time without  generating  a pickup in inflation.  But the simulations  provide thecautionary note that these  favorable effects on inflation  are temporary.  The lowerunemployment  rate  may look like a reduced NAIRU, but inflation will begin  topick up if unemployment  is held at that lower rate, even if the dollar remains at itselevated  level  or the trend in productivity  is tilted up permanently.2/3-4/98In the baseline  scenario,  mild underlying  inflation  pressures  begin to emergein 2000  as the effects of the higher dollar of recent  years ebb, nominalcompensation rises  to reflect higher productivity, and  other favorable  supplydevelopments  wear off.  That  situation  is exacerbated  by the swing to a  decliningreal value of the dollar, which,  by raising import prices faster than domesticprices, places upward pressure  on inflation that must be offset by keeping  theunemployment  rate  a little above the NAIRU.  In actuality,  any decline in thedollar would not follow the smooth path of the baseline, but rather will occur infits and  starts, which will  affect the dynamics of the adjustment of prices andoutput.  But the  important point is that the  dollar is more likely to fall than to riseover the long run,  given  what would otherwise  be an  unsustainable  path of thecurrent  account.  Such a development  will leave the  Committee  with less  pleasantchoices than has the dollar appreciation  of recent years.In contrast to their effects  on aggregate  supply, the two  shocks  have verydifferent implications  for demand  and, hence,  for interest rates.  Weaker Asianeconomies  reduce  demand and require  an easier policy relative to the baseline  tokeep  the economy  on track.  In  the simulation, the  added weakness of Asianeconomies  effectively eliminates the need for the Committee to raise rates tocontain  inflation  and calls  for a modest easing at  some point,  leaving the fundsrate  about 75  basis points below  the baseline  for a time.  The  additional  shock issomewhat  smaller than the staffs baseline estimate  of the Asian  difficulties  aboutto hit our economy, which have been largely responsible for eliminating the  100basis points of tightening that had been  built into the Greenbook last  summer.Despite the effects  of weaker  Asian economies,  the relatively high level  of realshort-term interest rates that has developed  over the last year  or so persists in  thebaseline.  The productivity  simulation  may give some insight into the goodperformance  of the economy even  as the real funds rate remains  well above  itslong-run experience.  A faster trend for productivity increases  demandsubstantially,  as the accelerator effects  associated  with attempts  to keep capitalgrowing  in pace with the more  rapid growth in  output cause investment to jump,and as  consumption rises with  permanent income.  However, supply only picks upgradually, in  line with faster productivity growth,  and real interest  rates mustincrease  to forestall  inflation.Indeed,  strength in consumption  and investment in recent years  --driven  in partby elevated profits  and their effects  on the stock  market,  as might be expectedfrom  a pickup in productivity--are  an important reason  why demand  has remainedrobust despite high real  interest  rates.  Of course,  possible productivity  increasesare not the only  factor that  have been  buoying spending  at high real  interest rates.Another important  influence  has been  that in virtually  all other respects  financialconditions  have been  quite accommodative.  Greater appetite  for risk or perhapsperceptions  that risk is now lower have  helped to raise equity prices and havemade credit  available  at exceptionally  narrow spreads.  And the level  of2/3-4/98short-term rates  does not seem to have  materially impeded declines  in nominaland perhaps  real  long-term  interest rates  last year, helping to bolster demand.  Inthe baseline, favorable  credit and equity market conditions  erode to a limiteddegree  and real rates only edge  lower before they need to rise once again  for atime to counter  the effects  of dollar depreciation, remaining  above their long-termvalues  for some time.Interest rates  should be above  equilibrium  when the economy is operatingbeyond  its sustainable  potential  and inflation threatens to rise to levels  theCommittee does not find acceptable.  In large measure,  the real short-term rate gotto its current high level under such circumstances--though  the methodology was alittle unusual.  The Committee  tightened  last March,  and many members  foundreassurance  in the subsequent,  so-called "passive"  firming of the real funds rateover the rest of the year as inflation,  and presumably  inflation expectations,  fell.This firming occurred  with other financial  conditions  accommodative,  the outputgap widening  as the economy remained  on a seemingly  unsustainable  track, andinflation projected  to rise.But Asian developments  and incoming  data have  altered circumstances  andprojections  over recent months.  The central  tendency of the Committee members'inflation forecast  for  1998 has dropped  3/4 percentage  point  since July, while themembers'  expectations  for the unemployment rate at the end of this year are onlya touch lower.  In  the past, for given  levels of the output gap, the Committee  hastended to move the nominal funds rate with the inflation  rate--in fact by more,  toensure against getting "behind the curve"  in  countering either inflation  oreconomic  weakness.In light of the level of the real funds rate and  the way it came  about, theCommittee may see it as imparting a downside risk to the outlook. If so, theCommittee might want to be especially alert to further increases through  declininginflation expectations,  and to signs that its high  or rising level--or  greater concernabout risk by savers--was  feeding through  substantially to financial markets moregenerally and threatening  to damp demand more than the Committee  desired.Prompt response  to such signs or to unexpected weakness  in demand,  say becausethe  Asian situation was having a bigger effect than  expected, might be called for.With trend inflation  already at  a low rate, the Committee  might want to becautious  about taking the "opportunity"  to let it drop substantially  further.Moreover,  in the context of a yield curve that already  has built in some easing,might temper the response  of long-term rates to further adverse  demand surprises.We don't  have much  experience  with the evolution of steeply downward  slopingyield curves  arrived  at by declining  long-term  rates.So far, however, high real  short-term interest rates  do not seem to have greatlyaffected other financial  conditions,  except perhaps  for the  dollar.  Financial2/3-4/98drop in bond yields, the further  narrowing  of loan spreads  at banks,  and robustgrowth  in  the monetary  and credit aggregates.  As a consequence,  and perhapsbecause  potential productivity gains  and stock market  advances  continue to fuelspending, increases  in real  short-term rates and in exchange  rates do not yet seemto have  impinged  substantially on demand.  Strength  in hiring persists, judgingfrom low initial  claims.  Labor markets remain  quite tight and wages may be onmore  of an uptrend than the staff has assumed.  In these  circumstances,  the riskseconomic  projections  of Committee  members compared  to those  of the  staff,whether the future drag on demand from the Asian  crisis will be enough to stempotential  inflationary  pressures  is uncertain.Moreover,  the anomalous position  of tight labor  markets but damped  inflationprobably buys the Committee breathing room to await some clarification  ofdevelopments  in either direction  before reacting, without risking a seriousdeterioration  of economic  performance.  If escalating  compensation  andnarrowing  profit margins  suggest that inflation  pressures  are  turning out  strongerthan expected,  damped  actual price increases  as  the higher dollar and lower oilprices feed  through  will keep  inflation expectations  down and  add a  littleincremental restraint in  the form  of a higher real  federal funds rate until theCommittee responds.  A weaker-than-expected  economy will  only tend to bringforward  in time what may be a required  easing of pressure  on labor markets nowbuilt into the staff forecast,  and the Committee should  have time to react beforethe economy overshoots on the downside.  In  either circumstance,  however, delaycould easily become excessive,  and a sluggish response  awaiting unambiguousconfirmation  of the economy's  direction  could  accentuate  volatility in output andprices.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions for Don?

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Don, you noted  a few times in your remarks  that from thestandpoint of one  financial indicator, the level  of real short-term  interest rates, the currentstance  of monetary policy  may be interpreted  as  being restrictive.  The  measure  youmentioned  is  the overnight  interbank rate minus  some index  of prices--the  CPI or someindex  like that.  You then  referred  to a wide array  of other financial indicators  that do notsuggest a restrictive  monetary  policy at all.  These include not just the ample  availabilityof credit from  the banking industry but from the financial  services  industry more broadly,2/3-4/98the  relatively rapid growth  of various  measures  of money, and the ongoing  strength invarious  asset markets.  How much  confidence  can  we have in  the overnight interbank rateminus  the CPI as a gauge  of the thrust of monetary policy  in  the face  of all these othervariables  that are pointing  in the  opposite  direction?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  I tried to  indicate in my briefing that I do  not place  much confidencein that measure  at this point for the reasons you cited, President  Jordan, and  certainly thatnotion is inherent  in the  staff forecast.  We have the real funds rate  staying rather high.  Itedges  off a little measured against backward-looking  inflation  indexes because inflationedges  up a little in the forecast.  Even  so, it remains  at a rather high  level.  In the  forecast,that is perfectly consistent with moderate  growth  in output and essentially  containedinflation pressures  though  the  latter increase  a little by the  end of the period.  So, I don'tthink there is anything  in the staff forecast that fundamentally  contradicts  what  you  aresaying.  I do think a lot of people are  looking at this relatively  high real  short-term rate.  Anumber of members  mentioned it  yesterday.  I think it introduces a  bit of a cautionarynote here.  In fact, the real  funds rate got to  its current level  because the Committee  didnot change the nominal  rate as inflation  expectations  came down.  Ordinarily,  theCommittee does follow  inflation expectations.  I think it had good reason  not to do  so lastsummer,  but the way you got  into this situation  is a bit unusual.  We do not have evidencethat the high real  funds rate is somehow  pulling up  longer-term rates  but that couldhappen.  I was trying  to convey the  view  that if I were in  the members'  position, I wouldbe  looking for some evidence  that the real rate was  high and rising and beginning  to affectother financial  conditions.  The way I was  looking at it  and the way I tried to voice it here2/3-4/98was as  an element of caution.  It is something  to look at but we  do not see any  evidence  atthis point that  it is feeding through  to financial  markets  or certainly to demand.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Don, I may not be asking this correctly but  from reading  theBluebook and listening to you, I had the impression  that if we  allow the unemploymentrate to  fall below the NAIRU  after a positive supply  shock, analysis  suggests that inflationwill re-emerge.  Intuitively, there is  the differing view  that if we  have a meaningfulsupply shock and it persists,  we can  in fact let the unemployment  rate  come down  tobelow the NAIRU  and not have inflation  spike up.  That seems to be part of the  issuetoday.  Could you  give me a little more explanation in terms of whether you are  lettingthe model drive  this result or whether there  are other considerations?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I see two aspects to that, President Hoenig.  The model  is drivingthe  simulations.  In the model, there is  a NAIRU and if we put pressure  on the laborturn  will feed through to inflation if the unemployment  rate stays  below  the NAIRU.  Infact, we are  very uncertain  about the level  of the NAIRU,  and some  of these supplyshocks could be affecting it in a more permanent  way.  The cautionary  note that I tried tosound in this  regard was that some of those shocks  may look  as if they are  lowering theNAIRU,  and the productivity  shock is a very good example.  That  was a big shock, a onepercentage  point shock.  It provided  an example  of a situation where  you could keep theunemployment  rate low  and have low inflation  for a while.  Then you had a choice  as tohow  you wanted to take the effect  ultimately, whether as permanently  low inflation  or anextended stretch of low  unemployment.  But I think it is possible  for supply  shocks tofool us to some extent into thinking we have a lower  NAIRU  and that these  favorable2/3-4/98price surprises--there  is a  choice between taking them  in the  form of inflation  or inoutput--are  permanent.  In most analyses,  they are not permanent.  We  can have  moreoutput for a while,  but at some point the unemployment rate has to return to where  it was,and how much  we take in output will determine  whether we end  up in a lower, the same,or a higher inflation  track.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  It's a part of the struggle  we have been having over the last year.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Absolutely.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I think as  a way of characterizing this,  Governor Meyer  in hisearlier incarnation  frequently  used the term "an  effective  NAIRU"  as  a short-run,  maybetransitional,  phenomenon  in the context of a more  permanent NAIRU.  That permanentNAIRU  would re-manifest itself after the shock had run its course.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions for Don?  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you.  Don, I was  intrigued by the final comment in yourpresentation  about the danger  of sluggish  reactions of monetary policy on the  upside orthe downside.  It made me wonder if you know of any work on whether there isasymmetry  in terms of the amount of time it takes the economy  to react to a change ininterest rates  directed at weakness  versus one  directed at counteracting  inflation?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  I'm not aware  of any asymmetry  in the modeling  exercises,  but Ithink there  is asymmetry  in the normal course of raising  and lowering  rates.  One pointthat I tried to convey and have the Committee begin to think about relates  to  situationswhen inflation  and nominal interest  rates are down  to very low  levels, though wecertainly  are not there.  We have  a nominal  funds rate of 5-1/2 percent right now.  But one2/3-4/98can imagine  the economy running  along at a  1 percent inflation rate  and a 2 or 3  percentnominal funds rate.  The economy then  gets hit by a shock,  and policymakers  have thatzero constraint  on the  nominal funds rate that  is bedeviling the Japanese right now.  So,there  are some asymmetries  from that perspective.  There is no limit on  how high anominal rate  can go, but there is a downside  limit at zero.  There is potential  asymmetrywith regard  to the zero level  on nominal  wages that others have  talked about.  If inflationis very low or has started to go down to  very low  levels,  there might be more  adversetradeoffs  on inflation  on the Phillips  curve basis because  people are reluctant  to reducenominal  wages.  We have  seen no evidence  of that, but that is  something that people havebeen concerned  about in  the past.  So, one  thing that is being discussed  now, and this isperhaps  relevant to what Governor Meyer was  saying before,  is that we have inflationdown so low or potentially  getting so  low, particularly if it falls short of current  forecasts,that it affects how  we think  about monetary  policy.  President McTeer's  rule of thumbyesterday was to  subtract  a percentage  point from the staff's inflation  projection.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  You cannot do that!

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  You have  a low rate  of inflation  and you might at least have in mindsome  asymmetries  in  the context of low inflation, particularly if it turns  out to be muchbelow  2 percent.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I am  trying to translate that into thinking  about howforward-looking monetary policy needs  to be.  You seem to say that there is at least somelogic to being more forward-looking  if we think the  economy is going to be weaker in thefuture, particularly  given where  we are.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  If we are  at a very low rate of inflation.2/3-4/98

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Right.  Then,  given where we  are, can  you really  say that  thereis a  greater necessity to be more forward-looking  if we anticipate  an economy that isgetting  weaker than if we  expect inflation  to rise slightly in the future?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Ideally, of course, you want to have good  foresight and  act in  aforward-looking  way in both directions.  Because  inflation has been above its long-runtarget for a long time,  the Committee  may have  a tendency to be  a little more sluggish  toreact to downside shocks.  After  all, if inflation comes  down another 1/4 or 1/2 percentagepoint, that is a  great result.  But at some point,  you have to consider whether you  need tochange that kind of response.  If you are  more sluggish  on the  downside than  on theupside,  for example,  as is captured  in some  opportunistic  kinds of scenarios,  then youneed to think about changing  that sort of reaction  as  the economy gets to lower  levels ofinflation.  There  is the Japanese  risk, if I can label  it as  such.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  May I just inject a thought?  I do  not want to deny the  argumentabout  the real interest  rate level, but I would  like to remind you of some  analysis we haveprovided you in the past, for example, with  regard to the Akerlof-Dickens-Perry  notionthat at very low rates  of inflation, the economy is  going to run into nominal  rigidities thatwill effectively raise  the NAIRU.  I think that  view rests on  some potentially  questionablenotions  about the inability of our wage-setting  institutions to  adjust to a new environment.I have  in mind the recent experience  in which  we seem to have  been making  fasterprogress toward price stability as inflation  has gotten  lower.  There  has been  no evidencethat nominal rigidity has been  a major problem.  As  I said, one would think that  more andmore of those  institutional and psychological barriers  would break down over time.  So, Ithink the list of arguments one can  propound  to support the notion that we need to be2/3-4/98worried  about low  levels of inflation  seems to have  shrunk.  I just wanted to remind youof that.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Don, what can you say about the GDP path associated with  yourfirst  long-run  alternative?  What kind of output  loss is  associated  with that path to  virtualprice  stability?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  You  can  see that by looking  at the two lines  showing the rate ofunemployment.  We have a  sacrifice ratio  of 2-1/2 over 5  years.  So, in order to get theinflation rate  down by  1 percentage  point  relative to the baseline,  you need to hold theunemployment rate above  the  NAIRU for 21/2 point years,  or 1 point for 2-1/2  years,however you want to think of it.  That is the sacrifice  ratio.  I can give you  some--

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  One can do the mental calculations.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Right.  In the price  stability  alternative,  GDP in the years 2001,2002, and 2003  is  growing about  1-1/4  to  1-1/2 percent less rapidly than in the  baseline.  Inthose  years  we have baseline GDP  growing at rates of 2 to 2-1/2  percent.  So, we never geta recession in this  alternative strategy.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  It comes  very close.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  It comes  really close.  Growth has to be slow  enough to raise theunemployment rate  above the NAIRU.  We already have in the  staff forecast  a growth  inoutput that is below  potential  and that has the  effect of getting the unemployment  rate up.You have to have  a number of more  years of that in the virtual price  stability simulation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Other  questions?  If not, let me get started on thepolicy issue.  To repeat what we heard around this table yesterday, the key to theeconomic  outlook and to our policy stance  is very clearly  how we evaluate the tsunami  of2/3-4/98the Asian crisis.  It is rolling across  the  Pacific  and the question  is when it will  get hereand  how large  the wave  will be.  At the moment,  all  we are  feeling  is a little spray, but  weknow  something is happening.  The reason  we know  is that we have  some  hard evidencethat  suggests something more  than  a mere ripple.We  have seen  a fairly pronounced  decline  in exchange  rates  vis-a-vis  the dollar.We do not yet have  firm data, but we strongly  suspect that net capital  flows into  thosecountries have  collapsed.  And  when  capital  inflows come to  a halt or turn negative,  thatinvariably  means the current  accounts  are driven  into significant  surplus.  That,  of course,immediately  affects the trade balance  since the trade balance  must fit into the currentaccount.  In  Mexico,  as we saw,  there was  a really  sharp  adjustment.  It  would notordinarily  be that  steep when  we are  dealing with  a number  of countries since obviouslytheir economies  are functioning  at different  levels  and growing  at  different  rates.  Butbecause of the  order of magnitude  of the exchange  rate  adjustments  we  have seen  in Asia,I suspect the declines  in capital  flows  to those  countries,  when  we  are able to measurethem after  the fact, probably  will prove  to be  steeper  than they were  in the case ofMexico.  So,  it is  likely that after a lag we will  experience  a sharp discontinuity  in ourtrade with  those nations.The collateral  evidence  other than  the sporadic  data  we are  seeing on  tradeaccounts  is the quite  remarkable  performance  of commodity prices.  The averages  arereally representative  of virtually all  the individual  prices in  the commodity price  indexes.They drift  gradually lower until  the latter part of 1997.  Then at  the point  when the  Asiancrisis worsens,  they  go down more  decidedly.  I  am talking  about the whole spectrum  ofcommodity prices.  About the only price that has not  gone down  is my favorite indicator,2/3-4/98steel  scrap.  That  has stayed  up along with  silver and platinum,  which leads  me toconclude  that steel scrap  is truly a precious  metal.  [Laughter]  If anybody quotes me  onthat,  I am dead!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  People  will  not see  it in  the transcript forfive  years!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I have  said that in disappearing  ink for those  whoare taking notes!  In any event, it is quite interesting.  We basically are  seeing the shadowof this Asian weakness.  We have  seen it in the price  of oil, where  demand  clearly hasslipped quite measurably.  We  are seeing  it in copper, in aluminum, in gold, and even  insome of the agricultural commodities  where weakness  in demand is  bringing basic pricesdown.  So, it is not as though we are sitting here with no evidence  and wondering whenthe  Asian tsunami  is really  going to hit us.  As  I said before,  we are beginning to see itsearly stages.  What we do not know  is its eventual  order  of magnitude.It is noteworthy that private  forecasts of economic  growth  in East Asia arecontinuously being revised downward.  Even the IMF,  which very recently came  out withlower projections,  is  apparently claiming in  a confidential  memorandum  that the nextrevision  will be down  still further.  It is very likely that  we will see the initial impact inindustrial production  because this  tsunami clearly is not something  that relates toservices.  This is  as close  to a merchandise  trade  account/industrial  production  typephenomenon  as we  are  likely to get.  We will have  a fairly good indication  of the Januaryindustrial production  index in  a week or two as the data accumulate,  but we  do know thatthe  weekly data have been tilting down.  It is too soon to get  a good sense  of what ishappening to inventories  except  that the industrial  production  data suggest that inventory2/3-4/98accumulation  was quite significant  in November and December.  It was  not enough  toraise inventory-sales  ratios significantly,  but clearly  enough to stabilize what had been  ajust-in-time  inventory policies,  the mere fact that  inventory-sales  ratios are  flattening out,perhaps  with a  slight uptilt, suggests that there  is some backup in inventories.It is going to be difficult to measure how this affects  labor markets because theeffects  of shifts in trade balances  are not immediately  likely to show up one-to-one  inoutput and even  less so in the employment numbers.  When the economy  gets down to thelow  levels of unemployment and extremely tight labor markets that we currently  areseeing, the first response to any weakening  in  aggregate  demand  is likely to be laborhoarding rather than labor shedding.  As a  consequence,  the measured productivity  dataare  likely to flatten out.  But  at the first sign that there is  any easing in  the ever increasingpressure  in labor markets, I think we probably  will get a cascading effect, and  we may getthe same slip-off-the-ledge  effect in  employment, though  only with a lag behind theoff-the-shelf  fall in goods  production  that we presumably  are looking for sometime thisquarter.The importance  of that obviously  is crucial  to how we come out on policy.  It isvery difficult not to conclude from looking at the data through  December that we shouldexpect to  get, and indeed we  very likely are getting,  further pressures  on  wages,  evenfactoring in the quite appropriate  caveats that Mike  Prell raised with us yesterday  withrespect to the ECI.  The data show increasingly  tight labor markets with  a continuingcontraction  in the number of individuals  both  in the labor force  and out who would  like towork but are not working.  The pressures  in these markets  by any measure we look at2/3-4/98anywhere  in the  country are  as tight as any time I can remember, and that goes  back avery long way.If, therefore,  we do not get an  easing fairly quickly in labor  markets  or it turns outthat the tsunami,  while  very big for Asia, is only a small troublemaker for the UnitedStates,  then we are looking  at a stark demand  situation,  very tight labor  markets, andupside  inflation pressures.  At that point, the only thing  that can keep prices stable  is whathas been keeping them stable  all  along in an accounting  sense,  namely, productivity.Productivity gains in the fourth  quarter have slowed  from the outsized, franklynonbelievable,  gains in the third quarter.  I  might say parenthetically  that the staff isestimating nonfinancial  corporate productivity  growth at a 2.1  percent  annual rate in thefourth  quarter and cumulative  growth  for  1997 of 3.2 percent on  a fourth-quarter tofourth-quarter basis;  this is a full percentage  point  higher than in the previous fourquarters of 1996.Productivity gains  clearly have  kept increases in unit labor costs  at a very modestlevel;  indeed, the latter have  shown  no signs of accelerating  during the last  severalquarters.  The increases  in  such costs in the four quarters  ended in  1997  are estimated  atslightly under  1 percent and at 1 percent for the previous  year.  Similarly, unit nonlaborcosts have continued  to decline and overall  unit costs  for all practical  purposes  are withinshouting range of zero and have  been  that way for the last  12  to  18  months.  With profit1 percent for the implicit  deflator and slightly less for the nonfinancial  corporate  sector.So,  the growth of the cost structure  is effectively  zero.  Indeed,  all of the price increase  is,in effect, increased profit margins.2/3-4/98As Don Kohn  said, we  have  some  fairly significant  leeway here.  While Ianticipated  that the statistically measured productivity  number for the fourth  quarter of1997  would be artificially  low merely  because of the clearly noncredible  6.7 percentannual  rate of increase  in the  third quarter,  the fallback to 2.1  percent is a lot more than Ithought it would  be.  In looking at the monthly price patterns, we are seeing a failure ofpipeline inflation  to emerge.  This is  wholly consistent with an economy that  isengendering  nominal acceleration  in wages from  the productivity  side and evidently  notfrom pressures  on resources  per se, even though it is very difficult to reconcile the latternotion with labor markets  that already are very tight and becoming increasingly so.As  a consequence  of all this, it strikes  me that we are dealing  with  a situation inwhich the next several  weeks  are going  to determine the extent to which  the tsunami  willhit us.  It will probably take a couple of months for us to get a much better  fix on theorder of magnitude because  it will  take that long to get  a better fix on what is going on inEast Asia and also its impact on  Europe, Japan,  and Canada.  We  also will have  a couplemore months of data on orders  and production.  It will be very interesting to see whetherthe  incoming data tell us anything  more about the issue that  Vice  Chairman McDonoughraised concerning the ECI services  numbers,  which  are  a counterforce  to the slowdown  ofinflation  in  the goods  area.To summarize  and merely reaffirm what I heard around this table yesterday, thereis considerable  concern that  a deflationary push from East Asia is going to affect theeconomy in the short term.  We do not know  what its size  will  be.  This  suggests that aposition  of wait-and-see  is clearly the  appropriate policy for the short term.  I am not surewhether we will know enough  about the magnitude  and the ultimate  consequences  of the2/3-4/98Asian effect in time for the March  meeting,  as  Governor Rivlin  suggested,  but clearly  weare  going to know  substantially more  as each week  goes on.  I think it is  going to beimportant  to be sensitive  to moving in one direction or the other if called for.  For themoment, I see  very little choice but to stay where  we are,  namely "B"  symmetric.President Boehne.

What worries  me is  that if these risks are verified  as wego forward,  we will indeed get what you referred  to a minute  ago as  a  stark demandsituation where we do not have  very many good choices.  So, I still favor alternative  "C"for whatever that is  worth.  If we do not adopt that alternative,  it strikes  me--given  thecontinued  very strong incoming  data--that the Committee  might consider moving toasymmetry  toward tightness.

Thiscombined with the fact that we have  such tight labor markets  suggests  to me thatasymmetry  in the direction  of higher rates  is the proper position.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  your recommendation.  I want to say aword  about what I think a symmetric  directive means.  Sometimes, one  thinks of it asmeaning that  there is  an equal  probability that the next policy  move might  be up  or down.I do believe,  given  the tight labor markets and the  continuing strength  of demand, thatthe next move still is more likely to be up--that there is that upside  risk.  On the otherhand, I think a symmetric  directive  signals our readiness to respond  rapidly to a sharperdowndrift from Asia than we  foresee in  the baseline  forecast.I also want to come back  and mention  something  about the longer-runsimulations.  It seems  to me  that the two-day  meetings we  have  twice  a year are  anopportunity to  think about some of the  longer-range strategic  issues  facing monetarypolicy rather than always  focusing meeting  by meeting  on just one  decision.  In my  view,that is the value of the simulations  of alternative policy strategies that the staff haspresented to us.  In those  simulations they considered,  for example, a  couple of options2/3-4/98for longer-term monetary policy--either  to stabilize  inflation  at 2 percent  or to reduce  itfurther to,  say,  1 percent  for the PCE.  As I read that, the question  occurred  to me, why dowe make the  staff guess at our longer-range  inflation  target?  One of the reasons might  bethat we are  uncertain  ourselves  about our long-range  inflation  target  because  of issuesrelating to the perils of deflation.  Do we want to center our inflation target in the  long runon true zero inflation  so that  a typical recession  would  always  be accompanied  bydeflation?  I'm not sure.  Is a little  deflation worse than a  little inflation?  Maybe,  but I'mnot sure  about that either.  I would  like to encourage the  staff to think more  about theseissues, give us some guidance  about them,  and perhaps  devote some  of their simulationsto them.  We might then set aside  some time at the next two-day meeting in July to focuson those issues.

MR. FERGUSON.  Mr. Chairman,  I support your recommendation.  Yesterday,  Ispoke a bit about risks  and the fact that we  are risk takers.  I think we are takingreasonable risks by waiting to see exactly what happens.  We need time to observe  thestrength  of the factors that will be exerting  an impact on both  sides of the  economy.  Theother comment  I would like  to make to explain why I  support your recommendationrelates  to a topic that does  not come up much at these  meetings, namely, communications.We seem to have gotten ourselves  in a position  of having an implicit contract tocommunicate  with financial markets.  All we have  communicated  thus far is  a great dealof balance.  Given  what we have communicated  and our implicit contract, I think it isappropriate  for us to retain  the balanced  approach  that we  adopted  at the last meeting.  It2/3-4/98and  we have  to live with it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stem.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I agree with  your recommendation  as  well.  I  also want to endorsethe comments made by President Broaddus  and Governor Meyer.  They were implicit insome of Don Kohn's comments  as well.  Now that  inflation has come down a good deal,  Ithink it is important  that we focus more specifically on what we  view as  our priceobjective.  I  say that not only because  it may help us to communicate  to the public  whatwe are trying to do, but I believe it will help the inner workings of the Committee  overtime.  So, I would  agree that we  should spend some time on that issue in July.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Of course, what has happened to  us is that  the costof lowering  inflation that we  always presumed  to be negative  has turned out to bepositive.  We have  been  given a bonus  that  we did not earn.  The question  is,  do we makegood use of it or do we dissipate  it?  That  may well be the usefulness  of trying  to focus  onwhere we want to go and what we  should do from here.  I think the issues raised in ourearlier discussions  of the nature of prices  and where  we are in relation  to price stabilityare becoming  quite important, especially if Al Broaddus turns out to be  more cautiousthan he needs to be and the Asian crisis  has a more deflationary  effect  on our economythan we  now anticipate.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I very much  favor your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman.  Iagree it would be  useful to revisit our discussions about inflation  even though we  havehad many of them without  coming to any  hard conclusions.  Maybe it will be  moreproductive  this time in the sense  that we will have a  longer period of low inflation  to2/3-4/98observe.  Perhaps we can  derive more  information  about the  real tradeoffs  from thatexperience.I am a little nervous  about this notion of being forward-looking.  Do we  still knowhow to do it?  Do we know enough  with enough  confidence  to be able to say that we needto tighten policy  when we  are not observing any real  inflation,  or that we need to  easepolicy when we are  not seeing any real  deflation?  You emphasized  that there is apremium on quick movement, and I think there is.  I believe that we need  to beforward-looking.  I wish I understood better how to do it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We have  to be careful.  The preemptive  move  thatwe made in early  1994 occurred  on one of those very rare occasions  when we couldactually see that the funds rate was fundamentally  out of line  and it was dangerous tokeep it there.  We did not know to what level the funds rate ultimately would need to go,but we  knew the direction  was up.  It is going  to be  very difficult to find situations  suchas that in early  1994 in  which  we can  take action  with the  same degree  of confidence.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  That is my worry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It is one thing to say that  in principle we are goingto be preemptive.  Having done so successfully,  we may be tempted to say that this is likeshooting fish  in a barrel.

I thinkthat describes  our situation  and it tells us to "wait  and see"  and that symmetry  is right.

MR.  GUYNN.  I support your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  With  the obvious  advantage  of some hindsight, I now think thethrust of monetary  policy in  1997  was more expansionary  than I thought at the time, andit became progressively  more  expansionary as we went through  the year.  There is anirony in the way we now look at the numbers  and also  in how we communicate  them.  Afavorable productivity shock or surprise has meant that  the real rate of return on capitalwas higher ex  post than we had anticipated ex ante  and that relative or nominal interestrates,  especially the  overnight interbank rate, turned out to be  lower ex post than we hadexpected  ex ante.  This manifests itself in what we see  happening in the financialindustry, the banking industry, and in various  measures  of money and credit  growth.  Theirony is that the way a favorable  productivity  shock is reported implies  not only that  realincomes are higher than they would otherwise  have been,  which is certainly a  desirableoutcome, but it also is manifested in the form of a lower  level  of measured price inflationthan would otherwise  have occurred.  Therefore,  the change  over a  short interval  in2/3-4/98indices like the  consumer price index  makes it appear that  we have higher real  interestrates,  for a given  level  of nominal rates,  when  in fact our theory  tells us it was theopposite.  We had lower real interest rates.There is no question  about the direction of the effects  of the Asian influence.  Inthe statistics, exports will be lower than they otherwise would have been,  but I am notsure what that level  would have been.  Imports  will be  greater than they otherwise  wouldhave been.  In an  arithmetic  sense, those two developments  tell us on the basis  of partialanalysis that  GDP is going to be smaller  than it otherwise would have been.  But that isnot a full general equilibrium  effect.  Lower prices  of both imported  goods  and domesticgoods that compete  with imports mean that incomes  are higher than they otherwise wouldhave been.  I now think that we would have  been  looking at even stronger nominaldemand growth  coming into this year, fueled by rapid  money growth.  We may benefit bysome  amount--I'm uncertain  about the amount--of less strong demand than we  wouldhave experienced in the absence  of the Asian developments,  but I am not at all convincedthat demand is actually  going to decline  or that the rate of economic growth  is going to beslower than is reflected in  the Greenbook.So, I think the odds are  strongly in the direction  that  our next move will  be to raisethe funds rate to slow the growth of money and credit.  We are  going to see  a substantialacceleration  of prices even if it is somewhat delayed.

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  your recommendation  of  "B"  withsymmetry.  Just to make a few  points about it, the risks are large  on either side,  but theyare  very different and they are  very hard to figure  out.  So, it is difficult for us to be2/3-4/98preemptive  right now,  but that is  fine and I agree  that we should wait and see.  I think,however, that  we should tell  ourselves that  once these risks  are clarified, we  may have toact quite  forcefully.  The fact that we are not  acting now may in  a sense be  increasing theburden  on us to act forcefully  in  the future  if we can figure  out what these risks are,  andwe may as  soon as new  numbers come  out.My  last comment  relates to Governor Meyer's suggestion that we have a debateabout  our price  stability targets.  I think it is always  a good idea to have  debates,  but Ibelieve it is  going to be hard to  have  a productive  debate.  One reason, as our previousdiscussion indicated, is that we probably  all have slightly different notions of what wemean by price  stability.  We certainly have  very different  operational notions  aboutwhether  we should look at this index or that index,  adjusted this way or that way, andabout relative prices  or absolute  prices.  It  probably is  always  desirable to go through  thediscipline of discussing such  an issue, but it is  going to be a very hard issue for us toresolve.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let's have a roll call  on "B"  symmetric.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The wording is on page  21  of the Bluebook,  starting at thebottom of the page:  "In the implementation  of policy for the immediate future,  theCommittee  seeks conditions  in reserve  markets consistent  with maintaining the  federalfunds rate at an average  of around  5-1/2 percent.  In the context of the Committee'slong-run  objectives for price stability  and  sustainable economic  growth,  and givingcareful  consideration  to economic,  financial,  and  monetary developments,  a  slightly2/3-4/98higher federal  funds rate  or a slightly lower federal  funds rate might be  acceptable  in theintermeeting period.  The contemplated  reserve conditions  are expected  to be consistedwith some moderation in  growth  of M2 and M3 over coming months."
