CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection  they  are  approved.President McDonough.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  It  is  my pleasure, Mr.  Chairman,  tomove  the  election of  Frederic Mishkin as  associate  economist.  Rick,as  he  is  known  to  his  friends,  has  just  joined  the  Federal  ReserveBank of New York as  our head of  Research.  He  is  a distinguishedtenured professor  at  the  Columbia Business  School,  and we  are  veryhappy  to  have  him join  our  staff.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  need a vote  on  that  motion;  wouldsomebody like  to  second  it?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  We welcome  Rick tothis  organization.  Peter  Fisher, would you  start  us  off?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  [Statement--See Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I have  just  one,  Peter.  You mentioned thepotential  responsiveness  of  dollar/yen to  rhetoric  as  much as  to  whathappens  on  September  30th;  whose rhetoric?  Let's  take  it  as  axiomaticthat  it  won't  be  Lloyd Bentsen's.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I  think  it's  rhetoric  on  either  side--the  UnitedStates  or  Japan.  And in  this  country  it's  rhetoric  from  anyone who  isperceived to  be  expressing  the  inner  thinking of  the  ClintonAdministration.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Not  Congresspersons?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't  think  Congresspersons would be  theissue;  but anyone  who  the market  could plausibly think  is  expressingthe  inner views  of  key Administration officials, whether  in  theTreasury or  elsewhere,  could be  a source of  pain to  the markets.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Peter,  I have  a question on  the proposal  inthe  memorandum.  The  suggestion  just  struck me  as unusual.  Centralbanks  in  these  relationships  normally  deal  with  one  another  for  strongreasons.  I was  surprised  that  the  Bundesbank wanted  to  move  in  thisdirection.  I guess  I'm just  wondering  if  there  is  anything deepergoing  on here  that  you  can  sense.  Are  they perhaps  signaling or  does9/27/94this  imply somewhat  less  cooperation  or  a less  cooperative  spirit ontheir part  with us?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  On  the  contrary, let me make  a couple  of  points.First,  most major central banks  are  much more  advanced than we  inhaving  some direct  dealings  in  foreign currency  government securitiescustodians.  I would say that  we probably are  the  only G-10  countrythat  does  not  have  an  account with  Euro  custodians,  just  as  anexample.  That  is  a normal  activity of most  of  the  other  centralbanks.  Indeed,  the Bundesbank really has been,  if you'll  forgive  theexpression,  babysitting us  by allowing us  to  keep  rather  large  amountsof  reserves on  their balance  sheets.  We have  had quite preferentialtreatment--So,  I really would turn  the point  around.  I think  thatdirect participation  in  the  government  securities  market  isincreasingly the norm  in  terms  of  the  investment  of  foreign  currencyreserves.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  They  are  operating  in  our  markets?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  They certainly  operate  in  our  markets  in  thatfashion--Joan could  perhaps  tell  you more  about  that  than  I could--and certainly  in  the German  market  that  has  developed quite  a bit  overthe  last  five  to  eight  years.  We  actually have  been  receiving quitepreferential  treatment  from the  Bundesbank.  So  I would say  inresponse  to  your  observation  that  their  tolerance  for  the  slow rate atwhich  I have  been managing to  move  off  their  balance  sheets  showsrather  high  levels  of  friendliness and  cooperation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McDonough.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I have a  follow-up on GovernorBlinder's  question.  If  there  were  to  be  rhetoric  of  a warlike naturefrom Japanese  government officials,  I would assume  that  the  effect  onthe  dollar/yen could  also be  quite  dramatic.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Absolutely, yes.  I meant  to  include  that  in myinitial  remarks.  It  could come  from either  side.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I think  it  might  be  worth remindingthe  Committee  that  the present  Minister  of  Trade and  Industry has  infact  had  some  very tough  comments  to  make,  and he would  be  theofficial who  could very well  be  deemed to  be  the  appropriate  spokesmanfrom  their  side.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I would remind  the Committee--as  I think  Imentioned at  our  last  meeting--that  when  the dollar  dropped July 30th,31st,  and August  1st  on  the  announcement of  Super  301,  my view wasthat  rhetoric  coming  from  the  Japanese  side  had caused  that  drop,albeit  as  I mentioned last  month in  rather  thin markets  in NewZealand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Peter,  on  the  memorandum, what kind  ofincreased risks  do we  incur by moving  to  a private party and notworking with the  central  bank?9/27/94

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  there  are  a couple  of  different  layers  ofrisk we  have  to  consider.  On  the  one  hand,  the  Bundesbank  as  acustodian  is  really  not  remotely providing  the  level  of  service  thatprivate sector  custodians  are capable  of  offering  in  terms  ofattention  to  detail  and quality.It's  a very big business  and  it's very  hard for  them  tomanage.  It's  not a business  they  are  in,  really.  So,  on  one  level  wereduce  risks  at  a  sort  of  operational  level  by going  to  a custodianwhose  business  it  is  to  manage  other people's  securities  and make  surethey are  all  in  the  right place  at  the  right  time.  Another risk  thatgets  reduced is  simply  the  importance  of  having the  tri-partite agentmanage  the  collateral value--that  is,  ensuring that  there  is  alwaysenough margin held for  the  repurchase  agreement.  Now,  the  Bundesbanksimply won't  even provide  that  service.  We would be  doing  thatourselves at  some  remove  from German market  custody  arrangements.Those  are  two risks  I would see  going down quite  a bit,indeed with some  services being made possible  only by using privatesector custodians.  The principal  risk that  we  face  is  the  rathercomplex  and subtle  legal  one  of  our  confidence  in  the  custodyarrangement.  That  is,  do we  have  the  confidence  that  the  legalunderpinnings  are  such  that  the  securities  will  always  be  our own,  andwe  won't  have  to  worry  about  the  loss  of  principal?  That  is  theprincipal  risk  and one  that  the major providers  of  these  custodyservices know  that  they  are  in  the  business of  addressing.  But  thewhole  RP process we  will  be  going  through is  really focused  onensuring  that  we have  confidence  in  the  custody  arrangement.  Thefinal  risk  is  the  delivery-against-payment risk.  Most  of  the  privatesector  solutions  offer greater  precision and clarity  in  reducing  thatrisk  actually than  the Bundesbank  currently does,  but  we  take  comfortunder existing arrangements  that  it's  the  Bundesbank  that  is  providingus  the  service.  But  actually  the Bundesbank  does not  currently  assureus  in  any  legal  way  that  we  have  true  delivery against  payment  for  ourpurchase of  the  few existing government  securities with  low remainingmaturities  that  we  hold.  I hope  that's  helpful.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  With regard to  your answer  to  Al  Broaddus,  arethere  more  comprehensive changes  in processes  that  would be desirablethan are  proposed here?  If  so,  what  stands  in  the way of  implementingthem?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I will  mention one  thing  that  I may want  tobring  back to  the Committee  in  February.  The  System  Foreign Accountis  currently  limited  in  its  investments  to  maturities  not  exceedingtwelve months.  When that  limit was put  in place,  it  was  a simple  andrelatively effective  means  of  insuring  that  we  did not  take  too muchprice  risk.  But  it  also was based on  the  notion  that we would makesure we were always  liquid.  Now, in  my view this  has  resulted  in  aslight  irony.  We have  accumulated a  fair  amount  and have  thepotential  of  accumulating more of  the  decayed  securities with  aremaining  life  under  one year--German government  securities--since  Ican't  buy anything  longer  than  12  months.  Now, while  that  limits  theprice  risk,  it  subjects  me  to  rather high  levels  of  liquidity risk.This  stuff  is  not highly  liquid.  In  terms  of  having  liquidity  and  the9/27/94assurance  of  being able  to  get  out,  I would much rather  have  someportion of  the  System Account  invested  in  actively traded five-yearissues,  for  example.  What  I have been  intending  to  do,  and  this  ispart  of  the  process,  is  to  exhaust my  existing authority so  I couldlook this  Committee  in  the  face  and  say that  to  do  any more  of  what  Ineed  to  do  I need to  change  the  maturity ceiling.  And  so  I would verymuch  like  to  have  the  authority and  the  ability  to  invest  in repos.It's  a very flexible,  liquid  instrument.  Perhaps  after we have  begunthat  process,  we would consider  changing  the  maturity ceiling to  aduration  ceiling where  the  Committee would specify  that  the  overallportfolio  should  not have  an  average duration  of  longer  than X  and nosubportfolio should have  a duration of  longer  than  Y.  This wouldpermit  having  some  small  portion--10,  15,  20  percent--of  the  portfolioinvested  in  the  actively  traded  five-year  securities.  I'm not  thereyet myself  in  terms  of  our management  planning, but  the  repo businessis  something,  if  we could  get  it  organized,  that  would be  theprincipal,  and really  the  only, next  step  I would see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Could we  arrange a  facility with  theBundesbank  to  discount  those  securities  or  to  take  a  loan  and use  thesecurities  as  collateral?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  The  Bundesbank  officials  are rather  firm  in notwanting  to  give us  any assurance  of  that.  Now, whether  they would  ifasked  is  uncertain, but  they are  very  firm in not  giving us  anyadvance  comfort.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The purpose  of  a central  bank  is  tocreate  liquidity.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  They're reluctant  to  do  it  even  in  their ownissuing  short-term paper.  We  didn't  know that  was  going  to  happen.The  proposal  would  take  two  steps  forward, but  at  the  same  time  takeone  step  back  in  terms  of  the  overall  goal.  Notwithstanding  PresidentBroaddus'  comment,  the  goal  is  to  get  off  the  Bundesbank's balancesheet,So,  to  get  off  their balance  sheet,  given  that  they  don'toffer  any other  kinds  of  facilities  like  the  investments in  dollarsthat  we  offer,  we  are  left with  a  limited number  of  options.  There  isone  other consideration about  how  fast  we  should go  and how we  shoulddo  this  and  that  is  that  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank of  New York, ofcourse,  also  invests  the  foreign  exchange  reserves  of  the  TreasuryDepartment.  Although we  are  not  tied  to  following exactly what  theydo,  I think  it  would be  on  the whole  constructive  to  bring  them alongat  roughly the  same  time  in  this  process.  So,  we  think a wholesalechange  in  what we  are doing would be more  difficult.  Peter and  I havehad extensive  discussions  with  the  Treasury about  their plans.  On  thewhole,  I think  they  are pretty much on  board.  They may be  just  alittle behind us  in  terms  of  thinking  this  all  the way  through.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Go  ahead,  Tom.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  Peter,  are  there practicalconstraints  in  terms  of  how much we  can  do?  In  other words,  if  we  putall  of  our  reserves  into  the  repo market,  I think we  would probably be9/27/94in  excess  of  20  percent  of  the market.  What  would represent apractical  limit  there?  Secondly, what  are  the  practices  in  terms  ofcollateralizing a  repo  initially and what  sort  of  mark-to-the-marketprovisions  do  they have?  Is  it  comparable  to  our  repo market  here?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Starting with  the  last,  yes,  it  is  comparable.There  is  a range of  practices  that  runs  from being identical  to  oursecurities  has  really been evolving  from  infancy  in--

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  So  you  could pretty much  specify what  you  wantedin  that  regard?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.  Certainly we  couldn't  put all  our  reservesinto  the  repo market,  and  I wouldn't  want  to.  I would imagine  alwaystrying  to  have  some balance between directly held  or under repogovernment  securities  in  the  BIS  and perhaps  some  amount  still  at  theBundesbank;  we'll  have to  decide how much.  Having a diversity  ofinstitutional  arrangements  as  well  as  maturities  is  part  of  our  goal.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  We spent  a  lot  of  time  talking  to  people  in  therepo  markets  as  we proceeded,  and we  learned some hard  lessons  in  thatlearned  from  our  mistakes.  So  we  have been  trying, both  at  thecentral  bank level  and with U.S.  dealers  who  have  a presence  in  thesethey are  taking a  look at  some  of  the  early history here  and  learningfrom it.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Peter, you  said  a good bit  more  than  usual  aboutthe Mexican peso this  time.  Is  that  just  because  they had an  electionin August  or  is  this  a  reflection  of  the  prospect  that  we  are  going  tobe  paying more  attention  as  they increase  their  role  as  our tradingpartner?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  length of  my remarks  this  time  was reallypremised  on the  fact  that  we  had gone  to  some  efforts  anticipating  theelection and I wanted  to  follow  through.  I suppose  I could havesummarized my remarks  by  saying how  smoothly  the Mexican  markets andthe peso went  through the  election.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  As  a technical  matter,  we  still  have  an  offeroutstanding  to  the  Bank of  Mexico  through  the  end of  Friday  of  thisweek, September  30.  So  that's  another  reason  to  keep  the  Committeeupdated on  the  situation.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I understand  that  in  May Mexico  replaced Japanas  our  second  largest  export market,  but  in  July Japan  took secondplace back again.9/27/94

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.  My  own  focus  on  it  is  not  following  thetrade  account  as  much  as  the  anticipation that  New York  banks  anddealers,  who  are  in  the  list  of  100  firms planning  to  open offices  inMexico  City, will  be  trading  peso  instruments more  actively.  As  afootnote  to  that,  I would note  that  I asked my counterpart  at  the  Bankof  Mexico whether he  wanted me  to  include  the  dollar/peso  in  ourturnover  survey  of  the  foreign  exchange  market.  Some banks  hadsuggested it  to  us,I presented this  conundrum  to my  counterpart and  explained  thatthis  survey was  for  next April.  He  thought  about  it  and  said,  "yes."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay,  any  further  questions  for  Peter?If  not,  Joan Levitt.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Did I say  "Levitt?"  I meant  "Lovett."I'm  sorry.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  I answer  to  either.  [Laughter] [Statement--SeeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Joan?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  In  the  intermeeting period  there  has been  a lotof  discussion  of  the  exact wording of  the  announcement  that  we made  inoperations  or  in markets  in  general?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  The part  of  the  statement  that  was  released  inlikened  it  to  the  sort  of  attention  that  Talmudic  scholars  give--isthe  "for  a  time" phraseology.  The  rest  of  the  announcement followedthe  format  of  earlier  announcements.  It  has  not  had  an  impact  on  ouroperations;  it  has  not  affected us  in  any way that  differs  from theearlier announcements.  That  is  to  say, people  see  that  the  Committeehas  been  announcing  its  policy moves  and  that  has  tended perhaps  togive  us  a  little more  flexibility in  our  day-to-day  operations.  I'dsay  more  than  a little  flexibility until we  come  right up  to  aCommittee  meeting.  What we  have  noticed  is  that  each  time  we come  upto  a Committee meeting,  there  is  still  this  question  about whether weare  paving  the  way for  a policy  change.  That  has not  dissipated.  The"for  a time"  concept  immediately  after  the August meeting was  taken bymost people  in  the market  to  mean until  November  15.  That was  the"nuance" that  they put  on  the  statement.  But as  you  can  see  from  thedata  that  have  come  out  since  the August meeting and  the  market'sreaction  to  it,  I don't  think  they  feel  that  the  Committee  is  hard-bound by  it.  It  has been  a factor  in  that  people perhaps  haveresponded more  slowly  to  the data  on  the  theory  that,  having  saidthis,  the  Committee  would like  a longer  period of  time  to  reviewinformation  as  it  comes  in.  So,  the  response  to  the  numbers,  say thePPI  number, was muted because  (a) it  was  the  first  number  like  thisand  (b) since  it  was  the  first,  the  Committee presumably would wantmore  evidence.  But  I don't  think the  market  thinks  that  the Committeewould overlook  the  data  if  it  were  overwhelmingly conclusive.9/27/94

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Joan,  for most  of  this  year  I have been  tryingto  understand the  behavior  of  the  yield curve,  in particular  the partbetween  the  1-year  and 2-year maturities.  After  our  February action,we  saw a sharp  steepening  over  the  next  several  weeks  between the1-year  and the  2-year  rates.  After  the mid-August  tightening action,we  saw a complete pass-through  initially on  the  short  end--everythingshifted up--without  the  2-year  moving.  In  fact,  we  even got  a rallyfrom  the  2-year maturity on out.  So we  got  a flattening of  the  yieldcurve between  one  year and  two  years.  Now it  has widened back outagain  to  the point  that  last  Friday we had  a 100  basis point  spreadbetween  the  1-year bill  and  the  2-year  note.  So,  the  1-year  rate,  oneyear  forward,  is  7-1/2  percent.  I look  at  that  and  shrug myshoulders.  I don't know what  to  make of  that  discontinuity  in  theyield curve.  From 2 years  out  to  30  years  I don't  see  anything oddabout  the yield  curve;  under  one year  I don't  see  anything odd.  But  Ican't make  sense  out  of  the  1-year  to  2-year  sector.  Can you?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  I don't want  to  use a  technical  argument herebecause  I don't  think technical  arguments  carry weight  for  longperiods  of  time,  but  I will  say that  an  awful  lot  of  money has  beenkept  in  the  short  end of  the market  because people  are  very cautious;most  people  feel  that  rates  are  going higher  still,  and  the  short  endhas  been  a beneficiary of  that.  The  2-year rate  in particular  hasbeen  the  subject  of  some  debate  in  the  market.  A  lot  of  people  lookat  the  spread  of  the 2-year  note  over  the  funds  rate  as  being  toonarrow  to  be  sustained, but  that  abstracts  from  the  fact  that  therehas  been  a fair  amount  of  interest  in  staying short.  That  perhaps  iswhat has  kept  that  segment  of  the  curve  relatively low.  Bill  rateswere so  low  that  the  segment  that  you point  to  between one  and  twoyears may have been  depressed  beyond what  fundamentals  would call  for.People  are  questioning  the  spread  of  the  2-year rate  over  the  federalfunds  rate  at  this  stage  of  the  cycle,  given  the prospect  of  furtherFed moves.  And I think  some  people  feel  it's  hovering around  the  lowend because of  defensive moves.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Beyond  the  technical  aspect,  the  issue  I believeis  what  the market  is  building  in  for  our prospective  actions.  As  newdata have  come  in,  market  participants have built  in  a steepertrajectory  of  Federal  Reserve  tightening actions  not  only  over  thenext  few months,  taking  out  the  effects  of  "for a  time,"  but  for  theyears beyond that.  Certainly,  since  early this  year,  we  have  seenhuge moves  in  these  intermediate-term  forward  rates  because  of  thestrength  of  the  economy and  changing market  estimates  of  the  likelyFederal  Reserve  action  needed  to  counter  the  inflation pressures.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  We  see,  as  I mentioned,  that  people  haveratcheted up  somewhat  further  their  views  about prospectivetightening.  We  see  that  in  the  futures  contracts  for December  and  ineveryone,  as  I mentioned,  is  completely  sure  about where prices  aregoing  to  be.  There  is  still  a  fairly wide discrepancy  in  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further  questions  for Joan?9/27/94

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Joan,  the  two  camps  you mentioned at  the  endof your  statement--is  that  majority  51  percent  or  85  percent?Seriously, can you  give  any  sense  of  what  the majority  is?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  At  the  time  I first  wrote  this  earlier,  I wouldhave described  it  as  a narrow majority, but over  the past  week or  so  Iwould say  it  probably has  become  a more  comfortable majority.  I thinkthat's  the  way  things have  shifted  over  the past week.  People  reallygot  caught  up  in  the numbers  released  last  week.  They were  a bigsurprise.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further  questions?  If  not, wouldsomebody  like  to  move  to  ratify  the  actions  taken  since  the  lastmeeting?

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Let's  move  on now  tothe  staff  report  and Messrs.  Prell  and Truman.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--SeeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  [Statement--See  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  either  gentleman?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I have  a couple.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Go  ahead.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I have  a  couple  of  questions  for  Mike.  Ishould  have asked  these yesterday at  the  Board briefing  but  I  forgot.The  first  question  is  not meant  to  be  a  joke,  but has  to  do with  theemployment  report  that's  coming out  at  the  beginning of  next  month andthe  baseball  strike.  What  are you  expecting  the  baseball  strike  to  doto  that  number?  What  do  you project  that  number  to  be?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Implicit  in  the  third-quarter payroll  forecast  isan  increase  of  about  250,000  for  September.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Working  in  the  strike?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  This  includes  in  essence no  particular assumptionfor  the  strike.  We  have  made  some back-of-the-envelope  calculations,and  it  is  conceivable  that  it  could  have a measurable  effect.  Butmany  of  these people  are  part-time who  might have  found  something  elseto  do.  We  had  the  start  of  the  exhibition  season  for  football;  theyto  be  too  many imponderables  here  to  make  it  a very big  factor  in  theestimate  for  September.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Of  course, personal  income  and wages  andsalaries  collapsed!  [Laughter]9/27/94

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  There would be  some  loss  of  hours.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The average  hourly  earnings  approach  isinfinity for  that  group.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  It's  not  the  players  that  were--

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It  could be  a  few  tens  of  thousands,  conceivably.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I raise  it  because  there  was a  lot  of  talk  inthe  summer  that  the  World Cup was  adding  to  employment.  I said tomyself  baseball's  got  to  be bigger  than  the World Cup--in America,anyway.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  In retrospect,  the  numbers  through August  lookedas  if  there  might  have  been a World Cup  effect--if you  look  at  theareas  of  employment  that might  have been  sensitive  to  that.  There wasthat  falloff  in August.  So,  there might  be  some upside  bias,  allother  things  equal,  in  our  forecast because  we  didn't make  allowancefor  a big  effect  from  the baseball  strike.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Okay.  The  second question has  to  do withOkun's Law  and  the  2-year projection.  From the  end of  1994  to  the  endof  1996  you have  in  the  Greenbook  forecast  roughly a 2 percent  realGDP  growth.  If  potential  is  growing  at  2-1/2  percent,  that  suggests  agap  of  a percentage point  which  suggests  to me  a rise  in  theunemployment  rate  conditioned on  that  forecast of  about  1/2percentage point.  You  seem only  to  have about  a  1/4  percentage pointrise.  I was  just  wondering about  that.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  are,  I think, well  aligned with  Okun's  Lawmodels  if  you  take  where we  are  as  the  jumping point.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  From now.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Right.  Clearly, you  can get  a variety of  resultsdepending  on what  your  starting point  is,  but  we  looked  at  this  bothin  terms  of  the  simple  rule of  thumb  of  an Okun's  Law model workingfrom where  we  are  as  well  as  in  terms  of  models  that  can  reach back aways  and  take  into  account  some  of  the  errors  that  have  occurred andso  on.  This  looks  as  well  aligned as  our  forecasts  ever  are, gaugingthis  by our miscellaneous  Okun's  Law models.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Okay,  thank you.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I should note,  Dave  Stockton  reminds  me,  thatimplicit  in  this  forecast  is  potential  output  growth more  like  2-1/3percent  than  2-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That's  almost  enough  to  square  the  circle rightthere.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I'm  sorry,  I should have  noted  that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.9/27/94-10-

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I'd  like  to  ask a question  about  imports.  In  theforecast  for  the  third and  fourth quarters  the  growth  rates  of  importsare  the  lowest  we've  seen  since,  I think,  about  1991.  Clearly, thedirection  of  effects  from  exchange  rates  is  supportive  of  this,  but  itseems  as  though  it's  a rather unrealistic  slowing given  the  strengthof  final  demand  in  this  country.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think  that's right  if  you  just  rely on  themicroeconomic  indicators.  There  are  three  factors  that  I think wouldproduce  essentially  this  result.  One  is  that  we  had what  we  think  isa bulge  in  consumer goods  imports  in the  second quarter.  We  suspectthat  has  to  do  with either  some  combination  of  China or  spread  ofsanctions  against  China,  and/or movements  in  the  seasonals  in  terms  ofthe  timing  of  imports  as  they relate  to  fall  purchases.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  So  they  showed up  in  inventories?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Part  of  that  has  shown up  in  the  level  ofinventories coming  out  of  the  third  quarter.  The  second  factor  isthat  there  also  was  a bulge  in  oil  imports  in  the  second quarter--thiscertainly  is  a big  difference  in  terms  of  1987  dollars.  And again weare  getting  the  effects,  in  fact we  are  looking for  a decrease,  in  thethird quarter  as  inventories have  gone  down  a bit.  The  third  factoris  that  there was  also  a considerable  increase  in  imports  ofcomputers, which  in real  terms  had  a big  impact.  And consistent withthat,  we  are  anticipating  in  the July data  at  least  a drop-off  incomputer  imports.  So,  some  of  that  has  to  do with  these  longer-termfactors,  but  the  sharp  change  relates  to  our interpretation  of  thesevolumes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  I see.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I might  bring  to  the  Committee'sattention a  late-breaking piece  of  news  here  this  morning.  TheConference  Board released its  survey  for  September.  The  headline  isthat  consumer  confidence registered  its  third  consecutive monthly  lossin  September,  declining  2 points.  In  June  the  index  had registered92.5  but  it  is  now at  88.4.  The punch  line  in  this  release  is  that"the current  level  of  consumer  confidence  has been associated  in  thealmost  30-year  history of  the  survey with  a reasonably  livelyeconomy."  So  it's  consistent with  the  notion  that  consumer  sales  haveslipped a bit but  are  not  far below  the  higher  levels  that we  reachedearlier  this  year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mike,  this  is  a follow-up  to  Bob Parry's  earlierquestion to  Joan.  In  Part  II  of  the  Greenbook, Section  III-1,  thereis  a  sentence  that  says:  "The press  release  announcing the  Augustpolicy moves  was widely  interpreted  as  indicating  that  subsequentaction was  on hold,  at  least  for  a  few months,  and  longer-term ratesinitially  fell  somewhat."  Is  that  saying  that  you  think the  ratesfell because  of  the  "on hold" phrase  as  opposed to  the  action  itself?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Well,  this  is  open  to  varying  interpretations![Laughter]  Certainly,  as  we perceived  it,  that  announcement has  beenan  element  in the  sense  that  it  gave  traders  a period of  safety  inwhich  they didn't  have  to  worry that  every bit  of  incoming  economic9/27/94-11-data would necessarily carry with it  the  risk of  a tightening action.So,  they probably were a  little more  relaxed about  the  near-termoutlook.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  there's  an  interesting answer  tothat.  Most  of  those  adjustments  that  we `see  are  the  dealer  responsesas  distinct  from  those  of  the  retail pension  funds  and the  like.  Ifyou  are a dealer  and you believe  that  the  chance  of  the FederalReserve  lowering  rates  approaches  zero,  all  of  the unexpected  shockshave  got  to  be  on  the  up  side.  So  if  you're  taking  a long positionin,  say,  10-  or  30-year  securities  for a  trading play and you knowthat  we are  not  going  to  do  anything  for a while,  that  is  onediscontinuity you  don't have  to  be  concerned about.  But  if  there's  aconcern, if  there is  a Damocles Sword overhanging  the  system, you arevery reluctant  to  hold  inventories net  long.  And as  a consequence ofthat,  it  is  very likely  to  be  a combination of both  of  those.  Inother words,  the  50  basis points  implies  that  we will  not  be  activefor  a while,  and  then  the  statement  reinforces  that.  That  is  justanother way of  saying  to  the  bond dealers  that  it's  safe to  holdinventories,  at  least  so  far  as  potential  unexpected  Fed policy  isconcerned.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  It's  sort  of  interesting that  we  seem  to  be  in  asituation where we  could get  a positive  market  reaction  either bytightening  or  announcing we are  not  going  to  tighten.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  both.  I  think the notion  isthat  we tightened and  said we  are not  going  to  tighten  further.  It'san  effect  of  the  tightening and  the  statement  that nothing  is  going  tohappen  thereafter.  That  was  essentially our  basic  thrust  as  youremember at  the  last  meeting,  and  I think  the markets  responded  tothat  double  effect.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  You  can  see  in  the  fed  funds  futures  that  weshowed  on  the  chart  in  the  Bluebook that  futures  for  the  next  fewmonths  went  up because  we  tightened by more  than people  expected, butthe  rate  then  sort  of  flattened out  and it  was  revised  down  for  themonths  farther  out.  Whether  that  was  the  result  of  the  announcementor  of  the  tightening  action  is  a little  hard  to  sort  out.  I think  itwas  also  a bit  of  a knee-jerk  reaction.  The  last  time  the  Fedannounced  something  like  this,  in  May,  intermediate-  and longer-termrates  went  down,  and so  as  soon as  markets  saw  something like  thatrepeated,  those  rates  started  to  decline.  Within  three  days  thereally  occur  until  much  later.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  bond dealers  would prefer  that(1) the  Fed never  did anything,  (2) that  no one  released anystatistics,  and  (3) that  everything  was  trading  incrementally.  Underthose  conditions  they would  feel  comfortable.  Any further  questions?Cathy.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I'm interested  in  the  change  that  you mentionedbetween August  and now.  You  gave  several  reasons  and  the materialwe've been getting  gives  several  reasons.  But  in your mind  can youprioritize  what was  the  main  reason why your  forecast and  the  implicitamount  of  tightening  changed  as  much as  they did  from August  to now?9/27/94-12-And what  do  you think most hangs  in  the  balance  subsequent  to  thismeeting?  What data  coming  in are  you most  looking at?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Well,  I  think I highlighted  the numbers  thatstruck us  as  most  important.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Is  there  one  out  of  that?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  our sense  of  the momentum  in  the  consumersector  was  altered by  the  combination of  the August  retail  sales  andthe  upward  revisions  to  the prior  months.  Private  economists  hadbecome very enthusiastic  about  the  signs  that  consumers  really hadmoved to  a more  cautious  spending posture.  So  this  certainlysuggested  that  there was  still  a willingness  to  spend  and also  awillingness  to  borrow;  we still  have  considerable growth  in  consumercredit,  and consumer  sentiment  is  holding up well.  So,  I think  ourperception  of  where the  consumer is  has  been  altered.  I noted twoother  factors:  One,  at  least  through  the  current  period--this  doesnot  necessarily tell  you very much  about  the next  few months--there  isa  considerably greater degree  of  strength in  manufacturing than  we hadperceived earlier;  and, secondly,  the  housing  data just  have  not  shownthe  erosion of  activity  that  we  had  anticipated.  We  still  see  thingsas  slipping but not  at  the  pace  that  we  had expected  earlier.So  this  certainly  suggests  that  one  of  the  key channelsthrough which we would have  thought  that  interest  rates would  dampaggregate  demand  is  not working with  the  force  that  we hadanticipated.  This  has  its  corollary,  too,  in  all  probability, in  thefact  that purchases  of  household  furnishings and  appliances  haveremained very  strong;  that  was  the notably  strong element  in  theconsumer spending  report  through  August.  There  just  has been no  signof  tapering off  there.  So,  those were  key  factors  suggesting  greatermomentum in  aggregate  demand.  At  the  same  time,  the  employment  dataand  the  initial  claims  suggested  that  we  were  still  getting a  lot  ofgrowth  in payrolls.  In  all  likelihood, we were getting  a littletighter  labor market  than we  might  have  anticipated.  On  top  of  that--

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  You don't  have  to  go  through your  wholepresentation!  I was  just  looking  for--

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Right,  capacity utilization  is  much  higher.  So,given  the momentum, given  the  slack, we  have  felt  that  somewhatgreater  tightening  is  probably needed  in  order  to  hold the  pressuresin  the  economy down  to  something  like  those we  had  in  the  forecast bythe  latter part  of  1995.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  And what  would you be  looking  for  in  the nextdata coming  in?  Would you be  looking  particularly at  the  consumerside?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We will  be  looking  at  all  of  these  things.  Wecurrently are  anticipating  some bounceback  in  orders  for  nondefensecapital  goods.  If  we  got  another very weak report,  it  might  cause usto  revise  our view of  what  the  trend  is  in  capital  spending, which hasbeen giving good  impetus  to  the expansion.  Obviously, we'll  belooking  at  those  other  indicators  of  response  to  interest  rates, whichmight  be  the  housing  sector  and  consumer durables.  And we'll  belooking at  what  goes  on  in  the  financial  markets  to  see  how things  areproceeding through  those  channels.9/27/94-13-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for either  gentleman?If  not,  who would like  to  start  the  round  table?  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  I have beenreporting  for  several months  now,  activity in  the Atlanta Districtremains  quite healthy and we  see  that  trend  continuing in  the  future.We  are  benefiting not  only from  the  cyclical  gains  in  activity thathave  been experienced  around  the  country, but also  from continued in-migration from  other parts  of  the  country.  On  the  retail  side,  theback-to-school  sales were mixed, but  retailers  nonetheless  are quiteoptimistic.  Many of  them are adding  to  their  inventories  and theyexpect  strong hcliday sales.  As  a matter of  fact,  they are  looking  atnominal  sales  gains  of  6 to  9 percent.  Automobile  dealers  areconfirming  that  model  shortages  constrained sales  over  the  summer, butthey are confident  that  the  problem  is  being  solved, and  they expectsales  to  accelerate  in the  fourth  quarter.  Those constraints,  as  weknow,  are basically in  the  popular models.  Tourism has  been mixed inthe  District.  We have had quite  a  lot  of  rain  and  that  hascontributed  to  weakness  in  the  central  and southern  Florida  areas,which has  been a negative.  Also,  the  slowdown  in  visitors  to  Floridafrom  Europe  has  not been  completely offset by growth  in  travel  fromLatin America and Asia.Manufacturing  activity also  rebounded  in August  after a lullin  July--that's  a seasonal  factor.  The  strength  is  pretty much acrossthe  board--in motor vehicles,  chemicals,  health  care,  textiles,carpets,  and paper.  The weaknesses  are  in  apparel  and militarycontracts.  The outlook  for  capital  expenditures  is  improving;manufacturers  in  the  District  actually are  adding  to  capacity and theDistrict  continues  to  attract  new facilities  from  elsewhere.  On  theother hand, weak natural  gas  prices  incrementally pushed down  Districtrig counts  and, with  the price  of  natural  gas  being below  $2,  thatprobably will  continue.  On  the  housing  side, we  did  have abut prices  are moving up  nonetheless,  and that's  in  the  face  ofinventory shortages.  Construction was  hampered by  the  bad weatherthat  I already have  mentioned.  Multifamily markets  continue  toimprove  and the  occupancy  rate  is  increasing  around the  Districtgenerally.  Commercial  real  estate  is  doing  somewhat better,  althoughactivity remains  at  somewhat  low  levels.  In  financial  services,commercial  lending demand  is  stronger  than  it  has  been,  and  it  isabout  offsetting  the  softness  that  we  are  seeing  in  consumer  loans.Growth  in  District  payroll  employment  has  been about half  a percenthigher  than  in  the nation  as  a whole.On  the price  front,  we  are getting  reports  of  rising pricesof  raw materials.  This  is  not  something very new;  we  have  beenhearing  this  for  a while,  but  the reports  of  rising  raw materialsprices  and other  input prices  are  increasing.  Nevertheless,  ourcontacts  are  reporting  that  they  are  not able  to  pass  these highercosts  through to  finished goods  because of  competitive pressures.On  the national  economy,  our  forecast  continues  to besomewhat  stronger over  the  entire  forecast horizon  than the  one  shownin  the  Greenbook, although we  too  see  a deceleration  in  growth.  Partof  the  difference is  the  assumption about  monetary  policy.  We  did notbuild in any  additional  tightening of  rates.  But  I think we  also havea difference because  of  our view of  the policy  lags  in  the price9/27/94-14-determination process.  We  have  inflation  edging higher  until  at  leastthe middle  of  1996,  and  that's partly due  to  our estimate  that  theresponses  to policy changes  made  so  far  will  take  a little  longer  tofeed  through.  We do  see  a cyclical  peak in  the  CPI  sometime  during1996.  Our  forecast  really  incorporates  the view that  the  currentpressure  on prices  is  due  to  aggregate  demand  growing more  quicklythan aggregate  supply.We believe  that  our  efforts  to  reduce  inflation over  time  mayalready have  filtered  into  price-  and wage-setting behaviors  so  thatthese  cyclical  pressures  are  seen  as  temporary as  opposed  to  asustained  trend  toward higher  inflation.  I think  the  recent  behaviorof  labor  costs,  after a  long  period of  falling  unemployment,  providessome  support  for  this  position.  If  this  is  the  case, perhaps we  cantolerate  some  small  rise  in  inflation  as  the business  expansionmatures.  It  is  possible, of  course,  that  wage  and pricedeterminations  are dominated by  institutional  features  that,  as  hasbeen discussed,  in part  involve  an  inertia  to  all  of  these processes.If  this  view is  correct,  once  inflation  starts  rising  and people  buildhigher  inflation  into  their  expectations  so  that  it  persistsindefinitely in  the  absence  of  forceful policy  action,  we  have  to  actin  a way  that  shows  an  absolute  zero  tolerance  for  higher  inflation.It  seems  to  me, Mr.  Chairman,  that  our policy behavior  overthe  last  several  years,  perhaps  going back  as  far  as  15  years,  hasincreased our  credibility as  inflation  fighters.  From thisstandpoint,  the  outlook would strike me  as  one  that  we should bepleased with.  This  is  a picture,  it  seems  to me,  of  an  economyentering  the  mature  stages  of  a business  expansion and moving  toward  apeak  in  its  rate  of  growth  with very few imbalances.  It  is  an  economywhere  the  rate  of  inflation also  rises  to  a peak, but  one  that  issignificantly lower  than  in  previous  expansions  and  that,  it  seems  tome,  is  quite  desirable.  It  is  possible  that,  in  this  optimisticframework,  the  structural  responses  to  our  past policies  may haveraised  the  economy's  potential  to  grow as  well.  I think both  of  thesescenarios, whether  you adopt  the  inertia or  the  cyclical  peak thesis,are  reasonable  interpretations  of  recent  data,  but  at  this  point  itstrikes me pretty  forcefully  that  it's  simply  too  early  to  determinewhether  we  should be worried  or not.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  a number  of  signals  suggest  thateconomic  conditions  in  the Twelfth District  are  improving.  Thecurrent  data  indicate  that  the  number of  payroll  jobs  in  the  Districtrose  1.2  percent  over  the  12  months  through August,  the  strongestannual  growth  that  we  have  seen  since  1990.  Moreover, payrollemployment  data  for  a number  of  states  are  expected  to  be  revised upsubstantially when  the  1994  state  benchmarks  are  released next March.We  already know  that  there will  be  large  upward revisions  inCalifornia,  Arizona,  and Washington, and several  other western statesrevisions  in  the  state  data  do  not necessarily mean  that nationalpayroll  series  also will  be  revised up,  since  the  national  figuresalready  include bias  adjustments  that  generally are  not  used incompiling  the  individual  state  data.  Utah, Nevada,  and  Idaho had  thenation's  fastest  growth  in payroll  employment during  the  past  129/27/94-15-months.  In Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, the  pace  of  growth  isless  robust but  appears  to  be picking up.In California,  it  now looks  as  though  the  economy bottomedout  and  remained essentially  flat  roughly  from  early through mid-1993.At  the  last  couple  of  FOMC meetings,  we pointed  to  the bottom  as  beingat  the  end of  1993,  but  these  revisions  in payroll  data have  changedthat picture  somewhat.  However,  the  subsequent  recovery that  we haveseen has  been  slow,  sporadic,  and uneven  across  sectors.  While  retailsales  jumped  2.4  percent  in  the  first  quarter of  this year,  they  fellback  .6 percent  in  the  second quarter.  The unemployment  rate  remainedstuck around 9 percent,  just  a  little  less  than  the present  rate.Aerospace manufacturing continues  to  shed jobs  at  a double-digitannual  rate.Turning  to  the national  economy,  real  GDP  growth  appears  tohave slowed  somewhat  from  the  robust pace  in the  first  half  of  thisyear.  However, growth  is  likely to  average  slightly  above  itspotential  rate  in  this  half  of  the year.  Moreover,  at  present  levelsof  short-term interest  rates,  I would expect  to  see  a modest  increasein  the pace of  the  expansion  in  1995,  putting  growth  a bit above  thepotential  rate  in  that  year also.  Labor  and product  markets  currentlyappear  to  be  tight.  This  impression was  reinforced by  the  sizableincrease  in capacity utilization rates  in  the  most recent  release.While  estimates  of  what  constitutes  full  utilization in  product  orlabor markets  are  inherently uncertain,  it  seems  safe  to  say  thatwithout  a  further  increase  in  short-term  rates  such  as  that  containedin  the Greenbook,  there  is  a significant  risk  that  inflation will  beon  an  upward  trend  in  the  next  few years.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  The  Third District  economy continues  to  grow ata moderate pace,  less  strongly than  the  rest  of  the nation.  Totalemployment  is  growing,  although slowly.  Retail  sales  are  expandingwith  strength notably  in  durables,  particularly  in  autos.  Residentialconstruction  on  the whole  is  flat--down a  little  in  some  areas,  up  alittle  in  others.  Manufacturing continues  to  do well;  it  is  growing,but not  quite as  fast  as  earlier in  the  year.  Banks  are  reportingincreasing  loan volumes  including  increases  in  lending  to  smallbusinesses.  There  also  are  reports  of  a fairly  general  slippage  inunderwriting  standards--always  the  bank down  the  street, not  the  bankyou're  talking  to.  The  outlook  suggests  that  the  pace  of  growth  inthe  District will  continue  to  moderate,  although  I must  say  I amhearing more  concern  about  what  rising  interest  rates might  do  tobusiness  prospects.  We  clearly have  gotten people's  attention;  higherrates  are on  their minds,  and they  are  talking more  about  it.  Wagepressures  remain  subdued.  Except  for  input  prices,  inflationarypressures have  not  changed much  in  the  District.  The  competitiveenvironment  stressed over  and over by business  people seems  to  bemaking  it  difficult  to  pass  on  higher  input  prices.My reading of  the  national  economy  is  that  the  expansion  isslowing but  that  we  are  likely  to  get  more growth  than  we  expected forthe  next  quarter  or  two  rather  than  less.  The  strength  in  retailsales  coupled with that  in  business  equipment  and  faster growth amongour  trading partners provide  the  underpinnings  for  continued growth  indemand and  job creation.  And with excess  capacity  dwindling,  the9/27/94-16-inflation  risks  are  clearly in  view.  The major  uncertainty, however,is  what  lies  beyond the  next quarter  or  two  when  some  of  theslackening  of pent-up  demand and  lagged  effects  of  previous  interestrate  hikes will  be  felt more  fully.  The  skewing  toward greater upsiderisk may well  continue  beyond this  year  or  there may develop  more  of  abalance between too  much or  too  little  demand going  into  next  year.For  that  reason,  it  strikes  me  that  this  is  a  time  where we  ought  tohave  additional  monitoring of  economic developments  as  the preferredcourse.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  The  economy of  the  Second  Districtactually  improved over  the  last  several  weeks.  Retailers  were quitepleased with August  sales--reporting year-to-year  gains  of  3  to  8percent depending  somewhat on  the  area.  Demand  in  interest-sensitivethe  labor markets,  the  unemployment  rate  fell  a bit  in August  to  6.9percent  in New York and  6 percent  in New Jersey, and payrolls  grew  inworried  about  personal  income  tax  collections  going  forward;  as  aproxy  for personal  income,  they  grew by  3 percent  in New York  and  5percent  in New  Jersey  in the  most  recently available  months.Something  that  has  improved,  perhaps at  the  expense  of  Florida,  istourism which has  rebounded  in  New York City.  A possible  explanationis  that  the  press  is  playing up  very strongly  the  "law and order"approach of  the  new mayor  and  the new police  commissioner.  Althoughthe  crime  statistics  have not  changed very much, people  are  feelingsafer.  The hotel  room occupancy rate  is  up  to  77.6  percent,  which  isa 5-year  high.  The New York airports  are bustling and  Broadwayattendance  is  up  15  percent  compared  to  last  year.  The  conventionbusiness  is  coming back.On  the  negative  side,  it  appears  that  there  is  a hole  ofabout  $1 billion  in New York  City's  budget  for  this  year, which  is  nowinto  its  third month, and  so  there  will  be  a  further  reduction  in  Cityemployment.  The  talk  is  a cutback of  about  7,000  jobs.  Perhaps  moreimportant  over  the  longer  run  for  the  financial  services  industry  isthat  Swiss  Banc  Corporation  has  just  announced  that  it  is  going  to  bemoving  a good deal  of  its  activities,  including  its  trading,  to  abuilding  that  is  being constructed  in  Stamford, Connecticut,  a placethat  already has  a  lot  of  empty buildings.  When  their new building  isfinished  in  1997,  they will  be  moving most  of  their New York-basedactivities  there.  As  I think all  of  you  know,  the  conventional  wisdomhas  been that  trading  activities have  to be  in places  like Manhattanor  the  City of  London,  and so  for  a major bank  like  Swiss  BancCorporation to  be  flying  in  the  teeth  of  that  conventional wisdom  isreally quite  important.  If  it  caught  on,  it  could take  a  lot  of  veryhighly rewarded  jobs  out  of New York City where  they are very muchneeded.The  national  economy  appears  to have  less  near-term momentumthan we  thought  earlier,  but  fundamentally our  forecast  is  about wherewe were  at  the  last  meeting.  That  is,  we  expect  growth  of  real  GDP  tostay  in  the  2-1/4  to  2-1/2  percent range  in the  second half  of  thisyear and  into  1995.  So,  we  have  a  soft  landing  occurring but  probablynot  soon  enough  to  avoid a pickup  in  consumer price  inflation  fromroughly 2-3/4  percent  in  1994  to  around  3-1/4  percent  in  1995.9/27/94-17-Although we believe  the  risks  in  this  forecast  are  fairly wellbalanced, there  is  a range  of  uncertainty about  the  strength of  growthover the  rest  of  1994.  In particular,  as  the  Greenbook would  suggest,there  is  a  significant  risk of  stronger  near-term growth  than we  areprojecting.  So,  an  alternative  path of  short-term  interest  rates,other  than  staying where  they are,  may in  fact  be necessary to  combatthe  inflationary tendencies  that  could come  up.  What  we  are reallyconcerned  about  is  that  the near-term risks  to  our  forecast aresymmetric  but  we think  they  are  quite  large,  since  the  strength  andsustainability of  the  rebound in consumer  spending are  unknown.Given  the  firming  of  the price  data  and  the  significant riskthat  a surge  of  consumption could push growth  above  3 percent, wethink  that  there  are  two  alternative  feasible paths  for policy.  Onewould be  to  stay about  where  we  are  and  the  other would be  to  firmpolicy  at  an  appropriate  time  by about  50  basis points.  As  wecompared our  forecast with  that  of  the  Greenbook, what we  came down  towas  that  the Greenbook  forecast  looks  like  our upside  number.  Thatis,  if  all  the risks  that  we  see  for  stronger  economic growth  were  tomaterialize, we would be  about  where  the Greenbook  is.  We  don't denythat  that  is  possible,  but  it  is  the  upside  rather  than  the  midpointof  our  forecast.  So,  I think we  are  as  far  away from  the  Greenbookforecast  as  has  been  the  case  since  I have been  attending  thesemeetings.

MR.  BROADDUS.  In  the  latter weeks  of  summer  through  lateactivity in  our  District.  We  saw some  slowing  in retail  sales  andsome  softening in  manufacturing and service-sector  activity.  That wasreflected  in  our Beigebook summary  this  month.  But  the more  recentreports  from business  contacts,  directors,  and others now seem  tosuggest  that  this  slowing,  if  it  occurred  at  all,  was  transitory andthat  the expansion  in  our region  is  back  on track.  At  all  three  ofour  September board meetings--in Baltimore,  Charlotte,  and Richmond--director comments  were generally  positive across  industries and  acrossregions  within  the  District.  Consumer  spending,  including back-to-school  sales,  seems  to  be  strong.  Manufacturing  activity appears  tohave  reaccelerated.  Tourist  activity, Bill,  also  has  been  strong  inour  District.  Nonresidential construction activity  is  continuing toimprove.  A  few  days  ago,  we  got reports  that  a couple  of  large  firmsin  Charlotte have  committed  to  build  800,000  square  feet  of  additionalwarehouse  space  in  the  next  couple  of  months.  On  the  residentialside, we  are  seeing  a measurable  increase  in  apartment  construction.We had not  seen that  for  some  time.  So,  again,  after  a lull  it  looksto  us  as  though  the  overall  pace of  activity in  our  region has movedback up.The  apparently renewed  strength  in  our District  economycurrently  seems,  to  me at  least,  to  be  consistent with  the  strength  ofthe most  recent national  data  on production and  sales.  Taken as  awhole,  this  information suggests  to  me  that  the  deceleration in  thenational  economy  that  appeared  in  the  summer was  temporary and  thatthe  expansion  overall  still  has  a lot  of  momentum.  In  this  situation,I think  the  3 percent  projected growth  rate  of  real  GDP  for  the  secondhalf of  the year  is  plausible,  but  as  I think you said,  Mike,  it  couldbe higher.  Of  course,  the  full  impact  of  our  earlier  policy actions9/27/94-18-this  year probably has  not been  felt  yet.  The  sense  I get  from  ourdirectors  and other business  contacts  is  that  the  interest  rateincreases  that  have  accompanied  these  earlier  actions  are  likely to  beassociated with,  at  most,  a  fairly modest  decline  in the  growth  of  thenational  economy  in  the  months  ahead.  The  strong  recent  growth  ininvestment  activity, both  fixed and  inventory  investment,  is  certainlynot  suggestive  of  a business  expansion  that  is  about  to  run  out  ofsteam.Mr.  Chairman,  let  me just  make a couple  of  comments  withrespect  to  the  inflation  outlook.  I don't  disagree with theGreenbook's  inflation projection, but  it's  a bit  unsettling  to  me  thatthe  staff  is  now projecting  a  consumer price  inflation  rate of  about3-3/4 percent by the  first quarter  of  next  year.  I find  it  even moredisturbing  that  for  the  first  time we are beginning  to  see,  not a  lot,but  a  fair number of private  forecasts  of  inflation rates  of  4 percentor  higher  toward  the  end of  1995.  Moreover,  it  seems  clear  thatinflation  expectations  are  rising at  least  in  the  financial  markets.The bond rate  is  now at  its  highest  level  since  back  in  the  1990-1991recession despite  our  August  move.  I recognize  that  a  lot  of  thingscan  affect  bond rates  in  the  short  run,  but  a bond  rate  that  ispersistently  over 7-3/4  percent,  as  it  has  been  now  for  some  time,suggests  to  me  that  the  longer-term  inflation  expectations of marketparticipants  is  something  closer  to  4 percent  than  the  3 percent  ratefor  the  CPI  that  the  staff  is  projecting for  the  second  half  of  1995and  on  into  1996.  That  says  to  me  that  we  still  have  a credibilitygap.  Market  participants  do not  yet  seem  to  be  convinced  that we  aregoing  to  take  the  actions  we  need  to  take  to  achieve  our own  internalinflation  forecast.  So,  I think it's  essential  that  we  find a way  toreaffirm  our  commitment  to  price  stability at  an  early date.Let me  just  say very briefly, Mr.  Chairman,  that  one  way todeal  with the  credibility problem might  be  to  consider announcingexplicit  multi-year  inflation  rate  targets  leading  to  price  stability.as  has  been done  in  some  other countries--say 3 percent  for  1995,2-1/2  percent  for  1996,  and so  forth.  Right now,  it  seems  to  me, weare between a rock  and a hard place,  between  a lingering  credibilityproblem, on  the  one  hand,  and  the  concerns  that  a lot  of  peopleunderstandably have  about  further  tightening action  on  the  other.  Ifwe  announced  explicit  inflation  targets  and committed  ourselvesclearly to  achieving  those  targets,  that  might buy us  a  little moreflexibility at  least  with  respect  to  the  timing  of  our short-termpolicy actions.  In  the  absence of  something  like  this,  though,  Ithink we  need seriously  to  consider  some  sort  of  policy action laterin  the meeting.

That  doesn'tmean we  should feel  any compelling need  to move  today.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I would highlight  two  dates.  The  first  isfor  the  negotiations  between  the  United States  and Japan  and the  issueof  rhetoric  comes  up.  I think  the  situation  there  has  worsened  in  thelast  few weeks  and that  has  to  do  with  the  changing perception  of  thebargaining position of  the  two  countries.  Beginning with  the  UnitedStates,  I think  it  is  clear  to  the Administration that  itsconfrontational  approach  to  the Japanese  has been  an unmitigateddisaster.  The  U.S. bargaining position  today  is  substantially weakerthan  it  was  12  or  18  months  ago.  We  used what  would normally be  aweapon  of  last  resort,  dollar  devaluation, and we  used  it  inexpertly,and the  Japanese  economy  seems  to  have  survived  it.  Indeed,  thehas  hurt  the  Administration's claim  to  have  brought  long-term  interestrates  down.  The political  ramifications  have  been negative and  Ithink that  fact  is  now widely  appreciated within  the Administration.So  as  of  a few weeks  ago  the Administration,  from what  I was  told, waslooking  for  a graceful  way  of  surrendering.  In  effect,  the Japanesewere  told that  they  could basically set  the  terms  as  long  as  they madenoises  about  how painful  those  terms  were,  the  intent  being  to  saveface  for  the  United  States.On  the  Japanese  side,  the  choice  is  a  tougher  one.  It'swhether  to  take  that  offer  and presumably buy  peace  for  the  rest  ofthis Administration's  term  or  to  try  for  something more.  In general,I think politicians  over  there  seem  inclined  to  favor  a deal  thatwould be  sufficiently mild  to  get  them  through  the next  Japaneseelections,  but  it  would have  to  be  demonstrably mild.  I think  thecurrent  LDP-socialist  alliance,  which represents  the  anti-reformistportion of  Japanese politics,  would find  it  a particularly  sweet  ironyto  score  such  a victory, given  that  this  Administration failed  to  cuta deal  with  two  clearly more  pro-United States  and pro-reformgovernments  earlier  in  the  year.  However,  some  politicians  and thebureaucracy  see  enormous  potential  for getting  even more by holdingout,  and I think  this  was what  the  hawkish comments  suggested earlier.The  fact  that  the  United States  has  been defeated by the  Japanese  iswidely  appreciated  in  the  Japanese government,  and as  a result  theoption  is  there  for  a humiliation  of  the United States  that would bemade  clear by a negotiated defeat, which  so  far has not  entered U.S.political  consciousness.  The gains  for  the  Japanese by forcing  ahumiliating set  of  terms  on  this  Administration  or at  least  avoiding  aface-saving  exit  by the Administration would mean not  just  two yearsof  peace,  but  perhaps  a period  of  peace  lasting  severalAdministrations.  That  would mean  in effect  that  future politicians9/27/94-20-would have been  scared  from using Japan-bashing as  a weapon.  Ofcourse,  this  Administration can't  accept  humiliating terms  five  weeksbefore  our  elections,  so  the  possibility that  neither  side may blinkis  I think pretty high, and  the  result  for  the  markets  could betumultuous.The second date  that  we should be  paying attention  to  isa bit  of  a political  poll  junkie  and  those polls  coupled with  theBavarian elections  on Sunday  suggest  to  me  that  Mr.  Kohl  is  unlikelyclearly to  win  a  fourth  term.  Too many  things  have  to  go  right.  TheFree  Democrats  have  to  make  the  5 percent  threshold  to  get  intoParliament;  I think  they probably will,  but  it's  no  sure  thing.  ThePDS,  which  is  the  Party  of  Democratic  Socialism--my, how names  change--probably won't  get  the  5 percent, but  they are probably going  to  getinto  Parliament another way, which is  to  win  three  seats outright,  asthey probably will  in East  Germany by  direct  vote,  and get  their  fullproportional  share.  So,  somehow they have  to  fail  to  get  those  threeseats.  The  far  right  has  to  fail  to  make  the  5 percent  threshold aswell.  And  assuming all  these  things  go  right,  the  blue/yellows or  theChristian Democrat/Free Democrat  vote has  to  be  greater  than  thered/greens,  or Social  Democrat/ecologist vote.  Any one  of  thoseevents may be  likely, but  I think  the  chances  of  all  of  them  going  theright way seem  to  be  quite small.  As  a result,  I  think what we  aregoing  to  see  is  the  Christian  Democrats  and  Social Democrats  agreeingto  a coalition.  The markets  know what  that  means,  namely  an  inexpert,compromising,  and vacillating German  government  for  four years  withthe  growth  of  both  right  and  left  on  the  fringes.  That would  not begood for  Europe;  it  would not  be  good  for Germany;  it  would not  begood for  the bond markets.In  sum,  if  things  go wrong  on  September 30th,  we  could  facesome  combination of  foreign  currency bond market  problems.  If  thingsgo wrong  on October  16th,  I think the  result  would be  a short-termappreciation of  the  dollar  coupled with a general  sell-off  inworldwide  debt  markets  in  the  longer  term.  In  either  event,  thepotential  need for  an  adjustment  in  U.S.  rates  is  possible.  I'm goingto  be  quite  specific.  I made my views  on  the  efficacy  of  foreignexchange  intervention  fairly clear  several  meetings ago,  and  I won'tgo  into  that  again,  but my suggestion  this  time  is  that  ifintervention  is  requested, we make  explicit  that  it  be  accompanied bya change  in  policy and  in particular  that  it  be  accompanied by achange  in policy of  50  basis points.  Frankly, Mr.  Chairman,  I thinkthat  having  that  be  the policy  of  this  Committee would  strengthen yournegotiating power  in resisting what  most people  in  this  room  finddistasteful.  But hopefully we  will  survive both  September  30thwithout  a need  for  foreign  exchange  intervention  and October  16th.And if  we  do  so,  no  rate  increase would be  needed and we  can come  backto  the normal  considerations  of  monetary policy  in November.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

MS.  MINEHAN.  New England's  recovery remains  respectable  interms  of  the  data,  but  the pace  and  feel  of  economic  growth  lead me  toconclude  that  we may  still  be  experiencing the  lull  that we  thoughtwas  there  nationally during  the  summer.  In July, employment  growthwas  just  under  2 percent  for  the  region as  a whole  over  the previousyear  or nearly  a full  percentage  point  below national  levels.  Earlier9/27/94-21-in  the year,  regional  growth  had tracked national  levels  a little  moreclosely.  As  in  the past,  employment  growth  in  the  region  variesconsiderably by  state,  with Massachusetts and New Hampshire  employmentgrowing  at  just under  3 percent,  that  in  Connecticut  nearly  flat,  andVermont and  Rhode  Island employment  beginning  to  flatten  as  well.Growth  in  service  jobs  remains  dominant, with  two-thirds  of  the  jobgrowth  in New England over  the  last  year occurring  in  services.However, we  are beginning  to  see  an upturn  in manufacturing, a  factthat  has  engendered  some  optimism.  Consumer confidence  rose  slightlyin August, but here  again  it  is  not what  it  was  earlier  in  the  year.In general,  New Englanders  have  expressed  less  of  a sense  of  growingoptimism  over  the past  year than  is  true  nationwide, with  localconsumer  confidence readings moving  up less  than  10  points  versus  overdouble  that  for  the nation  as  a whole.  Perhaps  these  consumerconfidence  figures  account  for  the  general  spending malaise  reportedby our retail  Beigebook  contacts.Continuing  this  tale  of  moderating  growth,  constructionemployment has  been essentially  flat  for  three  months,  new housingactivity  is  slowing,  and  significant  commercial  construction has  yetto  materialize.  However,  both housing permits  and  the  value  ofresidential  construction  contracts  remain  considerably  above year-agolevels.  Retailers  and manufacturing  contacts  report  very little  costpressure  in  contrast  to  more widespread reports  of  raw materials  costincreases  six weeks  before.  And where  there  are  price  increases,  wealso  see  the  inability due  to  competition  to pass  on  those priceincreases.  Finally, while  the  overall  volume  of  District  bank  lendingis  growing at  a pace over  that  of  1993,  such  lending  in  thecommercial,  real  estate,  and personal  loan  categories  is  growing  at  aquite  moderate pace  compared  to  national  trends.  I don't  think  thathas  anything  to  do with  the  banks'  willingness  to  lend because  we  hearthe  same  kinds of  things  that  people hear nationally--that  there  maybe  some  deterioration  in  the  credit  standards  at  the bank down  thestreet.  There  has  been some  news  about  that  locally  in  the  papers,but  we  don't  see  a tremendous  degree  of  growth  in  the  actual banklending data.I should  note  two  bright  spots:  First,  there  was  a greatsummer  tourist  season  in  the  Northeast,  similar  to  New York, withreports  from  Maine,  the Boston  area,  and Cape  Cod quite  strong.Second, commercial  real  estate  markets  seem  to  be  tightening, at  leastin  specific areas.  Vacancy  rates  in  downtown  Boston  have  declinedsubstantially  and some  experts  are predicting  new  construction asearly as  a couple  of  years  from now, with  serious  renovations  of  olderbuildings  in  the meantime.  That  contrasts  very  sharply from whatpeople were  thinking when  I first  arrived  in  Boston  three years  ago.At  that  time, people  were  talking  about  sort  of  a  10-year  horizonbefore  anybody would risk building  something new in  Boston.On  the national  scene,  we  concur with  the  Greenbook  that  theprospects  for  the  third and  fourth quarters  look  stronger  thanexpected.  Labor markets  are  tight;  external  growth  is  stronger.Inflation, while perhaps  not  accelerating as  yet,  has  stabilized andforecast  of  increased rates  over  the  last  half  of  the year,  but theamount  and the  timing we believe  are  an  issue.  Looking  at  a  range  ofprivate  sector  forecasts,  none  seems  to  project  as  much tightening  asthe Greenbook  though  they achieve  similar  rates  of  GDP growth  and a9/27/94-22-moderation of  inflation during  1995.  So,  we  are  a  little  agnosticabout  the  degree  of  tightening,  but we  agree  that  the  risks  are on  theup  side.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  The District  economy  is  quite  strong  overall.In  fact,  there  really  isn't  an  area  or  sector  of  the  District  that  Iwould call  weak.  Tourism has  been very good;  maybe  it's  a  spilloverfrom New York,  I don't  know, but  everybody talks  about having had  arecord year  of  tourism, especially  in  northeast  and northwest  Ohio.Agriculture had its  third good year in  a row, which means  all  the  agsector  banks  have  done very well.  In  fact,  all  of  the banks  in  theDistrict  are  reporting that  they  are  in very good  shape;  this  is  thestrongest year  in decades.  Residential  construction is  very good.  Wehave  had some  reports  of  increasing house prices,  but  we  hear mostlyabout increased  building activity and not  concerns  about prices.Nonresidential construction has  picked up  a  fair amount  and  thatrelates  to  capacity  issues  that  I want  to  come back  to  in  a moment.Motor vehicle production  essentially  is  at  capacity, whether  it'strucks  or autos.  All  of  the  suppliers  as  well  as  the  assemblers aresaying  that  they are at  capacity  levels  and expect  to  stay  there  forat  least  the  balance  of  the year.  Retail  sales  were  quite goodthrough  Labor Day  but  then dropped  off  for  the balance  of  September--not  in  a way  that  worries people,  but  there  was  a noticeable  slowingof  activity.  Labor markets  generally are characterized  as  tightthroughout  the  District.  Even  some  areas  that  were complaining beforeabout  being  sluggish or  soft  now say that  there  has  been  a pickup.  Insome  communities,  people  associated with retail  or  fast  foodoperations  actually complain  about a  shortage  of  teenagers,  if  you  canimagine  such  a  thing!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  A  shortage  of  teenagers  who want  to  work.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  We were  especially interested in  the  question  ofcapacity  in  the  manufacturing  sector  and put  the  question directly  toa broad array of  manufacturers--the  whole  spectrum whether  it'scapital  goods,  machine  tools,  motor  vehicle-related, and  so  on.Consistently,  reports  are  that  they  are  at  capacity  and are  looking  toexpand  capacity.  Then we  turned  the  question  to  pricing,  and  we  foundno pattern at  all.  In  fact,  it  was  the  rare exception  where  somebodysaid  that  price  increases were going  to  be  a response  to  capacitylimits  and backlogs.  They really want  to  increase  their  ability tomeet  the  demand  that  they  see  through output,  not price  increases.That  led me  to  be  very curious  about  the  Wall  Street  versus  the  MainStreet  attitudes.  When we  look at  bond yields,  mortgage  rates,  theprice  of  gold,  the  exchange  rate--all  these  sorts  of  things  suggest  aninflation premium.  So,  we  asked people--directors,  small  businesses,large  manufacturing companies,  other nonmanufacturing businesses--whether  they were more  concerned about  inflation,  less,  or  the  samecompared to  two  or  three months  ago.  And with  only one  exception  outof  dozens  of  business people  we  talked  to,  they  said  the  same  or  down,with  the majority  saying down.  So  from  a Main  Street  standpoint,people  are  not acting  or  sounding  as  though  they  think  that  inflationis  picking  up.  In  that  sense,  I don't  think we have  lost  ground interms  of  trying  to  achieve  a situation where  inflation  is  not a majorfactor  in  decisions  of  households  or businesses.9/27/94-23-I'm puzzled by  the  international  financial  markets.  One  wayof  reading  them  is  that  we  are  seeing a hike  in  inflation concerns  andawareness  in  those markets.Regarding  the  national  economy,  I still  am  not  inclined  tothink  of what  has  happened  in  the  past  four  quarters  as  a  classicincrease  in  aggregate  demand  fueled by monetary/fiscal  stimulus  orsomething  like  that.  A year  ago,  we  had  gone  through  a significantperiod, several  quarters  at  least,  of  a disappointing  economy.  And wewere  waiting for  the rebound--waiting  for economic  activity to  pickup--and were  getting  to  the point  of  thinking  it  was not  going tohappen.  The Greenbook  forecast  for  a year ago had  a middlingexpansion  out  through  1994.  We  then  got the  pickup and we have  hadfour  quarters  of  fairly good growth.  But  I choose  to  interpret  themajority of  that  as  having been  the  effect  of  a transitory  increase  inthe  level  of  economic  activity  in response  to,  if  you will,  thediminishing of  the  head winds--the  depressants  being  less  of  a  factor--rather  than being  fueled by  aggregate demand  kinds  of  factors  as  inthe past.  There may be  some  element  of  that.  If  so,  we have  to  saywith the  advantage  of  hindsight  that  if  we  think  this  pickup basicallyhas been  demand-driven, then we  overstayed our accommodative  policieslate  last  year and  early this  year--that  we  were  fighting  against  thehead winds  longer  than maybe was  necessary and  should  have backed offthe  accelerator a  little  sooner.But  I don't  think  that  is  the  lion's  share  of  the way  tointerpret  this.  If  I am  right  about  what  these  last  four  quartershave  told us,  then as  this  transitory  increase  in  economic activity  iscompleted,  the  rate  of  change  naturally will  diminish.  Secondderivatives  have  to  go  negative.  I don't  see  signs  that  tell  me  thatwe  have  to  use  the  term  "tightened too  little"  or  necessarily even"too  late."  I would have  expected that  if  moving up  to  the  4-3/4percent  level  from  the  3 percent  level  in  the  funds  rate was  behindthe  curve,  then  we  would have  seen  symptoms  of  that  in reserves,central  bank money, demand  deposits,  other  things  suggesting  thatthere was  something  in  the marketplace  moving  equilibrium  interestrates up  much  faster  than we were moving.  I don't  see  that  out  there.As  implied  in my question  earlier  to  Joan,  the yield curve  may play apart  in  that.  Why  does  the  yield curve  from  three months  out  to  ayear look  okay?  What we  have  been  doing on  the  funds  rate does  notlook to  me  like  either  too  low a  level  or  one  that  came  up  too  slowly.But  I have  problems  with what  happens  between the  1-year and  the2-year maturities.  Why  is  the  1-year  forward  rate  for  the  1-yearmaturity 7-1/2  percent?  It  leaves me  in  a position  of  thinking thatwe  should not  totally neglect  the  information  that  is  coming  fromreserves, money, and  credit  and debt measures  that  say  that  right nowwe  are  in  a good position;  give  it  a little more  time.

MR. HOENIG.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  Tenth  Districteconomy remains  strong,  but  there  are  some  signs  of  slowing.  By  thatI mean slowing  to  a pace more  in  line with  the  national  rate,  so  theregional economy  is  still  very strong  overall.  We  are  seeing someslowdown  in  residential  construction which suggests  that  some  of  theearlier policy moves  may be  having  an  effect,  but  the  slowing  ismodest.  We also  are  seeing  some  slowdown  in  the  ag  area  and whathappens  there  will  depend a  lot  on prices.  Our  energy sector remains9/27/94-24-sluggish.  On  the  other  side,  we have manufacturing  that  is  verystrong, especially  the  durables  side  and automobiles.  Our  servicesindustry  is  very  strong  and our retail  sector  is  strong.  Commercialconstruction, in  contrast  to  residential,  appears  to  remain  fairlygood,  and we still  are  seeing  some  scattered  shortages  in  the  laborpressures in  steel  and  in paper manufacturing.  This  has  been going  onlong  enough that  individuals  in  these  firms  feel  that  something  has  togive.  Their margins  are  coming under pressure  and how much more  theycan be  squeezed is  on  their minds.  So,  in  contrast perhaps  to  ourother  contacts,  I  think they  are  thinking about  inflation.As  we look  forward,  we do  think the  District  economy willcontinue generally  strong.  There  may be  some  further  slowing,particularly in  the  construction area, but  we  think manufacturing willremain  good in  the  context  of  strong  national  demand and  as  theforeign  sector has  its  effect  on  our manufacturing.  Overall,conditions  in  our  District  are generally good and  I  think  they willstay that  way  for  some  time.On  the national  level,  we  see  growth  slowing  slightly  thisyear,  but we  think it  will  stay  above  the  potential rate  and remainabove  3 percent  on  the  year.  We  think  that's  also  true  for  inflationas  we  end  out  the  year.  Looking beyond that,  and  assuming we holdmonetary policy unchanged, we  see  some  slowing of  the  expansion nextyear  toward  the natural  rate.  But  we  still  see  an  environment whereinflation  is  rising  in  a 3  to  3-1/4  percent  range.  So  that  is  aconcern  to  us  as  we  look  to  the  future  for  the  economy,  especially  aswe  see  our  own  District  remaining  fairly  strong.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  economic  activity  in  the  SeventhDistrict  remains  relatively  strong.  Most  reports  indicate anexpectation  of  continued  growth  in  the near  term, with the  possibleexception  of  residential  construction.  Manufacturing activity  remainsrobust  but has  been impacted by capacity  constraints  as  has beenmentioned before.  Most  of  these  constraints  in  automobile productionshould  be  resolved  this  fall  except  for  some  selected, very popularmodels  where  shortages  are  expected  to  continue  into  next year.  Autosuppliers  in  the  District report  that  orders  remain very strong  andthat  production  is  "maxed out."  The  heavy duty  truck  industry  is  alsoat  capacity.  Our contacts  in  retailing generally report  that  salesgrowth  has continued at  about  the  slower pace  seen  in  the  secondquarter, with  several noting  some  improvement more  recently.Retailers  generally are  optimistic  about  sales  over  the  rest  of  thisyear.  For  the most  part,  inventories  are  in  good shape,  and manyretailers  indicate  that  they plan  to  increase  their  stocks  in  the nearfuture.  Competitive  forces  continue  to  hold down prices  to  consumers.Labor  markets  in our  District  have continued  to  firm up.  Demand fortemporary workers  in  our  region  is  very strong, with  these  firmshaving  to  pay wages  that  are  5 to  10  percent  higher  than last  year  toattract workers.  Recruitment  costs may be  rising more  generally.  Wehave  had reports  of  bonuses  being paid to  hire  engineers  and truckdrivers,  for  example.  However, we have  had  few reports  of  anysignificant  upward pressure  on  the  wages  of  permanent  workers.  Someemployers  reported  that  they  do not  expect  higher union wage  demands9/27/94-25-in  the  coming months,  and others believe  that  they  can offset  higherwages  through productivity  increases.Purchasing managers  throughout  the  District  report  thatprices  have been  in  an upward  trend  this  year.  Increases  in pricesfor  container board,  chemicals,  and aluminum have  been particularlypronounced in  recent months.  Some manufacturers  have  fixed-pricesupply contracts  that protect  them  from price  increases  for  theremainder  of  this  year.  For  example,  auto  and commercial  equipmentmanufacturers will  now be  negotiating new  steel  supply  contracts  fornext year.  However, manufacturing contacts  at  our recent meeting  inMilwaukee  contirued to  express  skepticism that  inflationary pressureswould prove  significant or  long-lasting,  citing  the  intense  andcontinued competitive pressures  that  have  been mentioned here  before.Agricultural  conditions  in  the  District  remain  quite  favorable.Estimates which had  already pointed  to  a near record  corn crop  and  arecord soybean  crop have  been raised slightly.  These  crops arematuring at  a  faster than  normal  rate,  reducing  the possibility ofharvest  losses.Our overall  macroeconomic  outlook  for  the  second half  of  1994is  largely  consistent with  the Greenbook.  We  concur with  theGreenbook assessment  that  little  slack remains  in  the  economy.  Theonly difference concerns  the quarterly pattern  of  real  growth.  Weexpect  slightly weaker real  GDP  growth  in  the  third quarter followedby  slightly stronger growth  in  the  fourth quarter,  and  thisdiscrepancy primarily  reflects differing  assessments  of  the  timing  ofproduction  patterns  in  the  automotive  sector.If  I could,  I just want  to  comment  on  the  U.S./Japannegotiations  and  the  September  30  deadline.

MR. MOSKOW.  Just  an  observer  from  Chicago at  this pointwithout  having had  any contact  with any  of  the  participants.  Theseare  complex negotiations,  as  we  know, under at  least  two  differentstatutes.  I  think  that  Governor Lindsey's  scenario  is  possible,  but  Iwould  say the probability  is  higher  that  the parties  will  reachagreement on  some  of  the  issues.  If  that's  true,  then  I would notexpect  any major negative  impact  on  the  currency  markets.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, with  regard  tothe Ninth District  economy,  the  objective  measures  of  economicactivity  suggest  that  the  regional  economy  remains  strong.  Theanecdotal evidence--of  course  there  is  always a  danger  of  paying  toomuch attention  to  that--suggests  that  activity has  even picked  upanother  notch, which  is  pretty  remarkable because  the  regional  economyhas  been operating at  quite  an  accelerated pace  for  an  extended periodof  time.  Nevertheless, business people  seem  quite positive aboutrecent  developments  virtually across  the board.  Labor markets  havetightened further  and jobs  are  certainly  readily available.  Despitethose circumstances,  there  is  still  no widespread  evidence  of  buildinginflationary or wage pressures, but  I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  thatthere  are  more scattered  indications  of  growing  inflation and wage9/27/94-26-pressures.  It  is  by no  means  widespread, as  I suggested, but  as  welisten  to  people  comment  about  input  prices  and about  what  ishappening  in specific  labor markets  and  so  forth, there  certainly  ismore  talk  today  about  inflation  than  there  was a  few months  ago.  Evensome  of  the  business people who  have been quite  skeptical  of  ourconcerns  about  inflation,  thinking  that  we  might  be worried about  aphantom,  have started  to  acknowledge that  there may be  a little  moreto  it  than  they  at  least  thought  earlier.  It's  also  true  that  when wetalk  to  bankers--I  think  this  came  across  in  the  FAC  minutes  but  itcomes  across  almost  everywhere--if  anything credit  is  a good deal  morereadily available  today  to  small  and medium-size businesses  than  itwas  a year  ago  or  even  less.  It  does  not appear  that  our moves  towardhigher  interest  rates have  had any  restraining effect  in  that  sector.With regard  to  the national  economy,  it  may be  slowing, butnot  very much  in my view, although  I will  admit  that  depending  on  howthe  inventory numbers play  out,  we  could get  some  readings  of  real  GDPthat  suggest  a  slowing.  My reading  of  the  incoming data at  thenational  level  suggests  there  is  a good deal  of  momentum  in theexpansion.  I guess  the  only way I can describe  it  is  that  it  looksstrong.  I do  think  this  will  be  accompanied by  some  acceleration  ofinflation  as  the  Greenbook  suggests.  Bob Forrestal  raised  aninteresting point  that  this  may be  just  a temporary,  cyclical  spikethat  we need not  get very worried about.  But  it  seems  to me  thatidentifying whether  it's  a  temporary  spike  as  opposed to  somethingmore durable  may turn  out  to  be  exceedingly difficult,  and  certainlyhistory doesn't provide very much comfort  on  that  score.

[SECTION]

MR.  MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  Despite  hopes  to  the  contrary,the  fact  is  that  inflation has  turned up.  Projected  strength indemand, which  is  a view we  would certainly  associate  ourselves  with,months,  both  retail  sales  growth  and  industrial production haveaccelerated.  Payroll  employment  growth continues  to  be  strong.Correspondingly, as  has  been mentioned,  capacity utilization has  risenwell  above  its  1967  through  1993  average of  about  82  percent.  Arebound  in  auto production  in August  and recent  announcements  of  autosales  and production  schedules  point  to  improving growth  in  industrialoutput  through  the end  of  this  year.In  the  Eighth  District,  auto production  has  been booming  inthe  third quarter,  and producers  recently have  boosted productionplans  for  the  fourth  quarter.  Production at  Ford and Chrysler  plantsin  St.  Louis  is  planned  to  rise by about  11  percent  from  the  thirdquarter  and by more  than  2 percent  from year-ago boom  levels.  Autoindustry officials  continue  to  see  sales  constrained by  supply asproducers  reduce  output  in  some  areas  to  retool  and make  capacityimprovements.  Overall  in  the  Eighth  District,  there has  been  someleveling  in  economic  activity but  at  a very high  level  inasmuch as  wehad  recovered  to  near capacity  far  faster  than  the  nation as  a whole.Nonetheless,  employment  in  the  District  remains  robust  as  theunemployment rate  hovers  near  its  lowest  level  since  August  1974.Reports  of  labor shortages  in  certain  trades  and geographic  areas  areincreasing  in my judgment.  For  example,  in  the  construction  trades,there  are  now reports  of  shortages  throughout  the  District.  Incertain areas  that  had been very successful  in  attracting newbusiness--areas  like  Bowling Green, Kentucky  and Jackson, Tennessee--regional  development  efforts  are  being altered  to  reassure new andexpanding  businesses  about  the  continuing availability of  labor.Jackson, for  example,  recently has  announced a  six-month hiatus  inrecruiting large business  prospects.  In  some  areas,  there  areshortages  even  of  unskilled labor,  although these  are  being  offset  incertain cases  by hiring  immigrant  laborers  from Mexico,  for  example  innorthwest  Arkansas.  Turnover  rates  are  very high.  Firms  reporthaving  to  hire  two  to  three  apparently qualified workers--and  thatimplies  screening a  lot  more--at  this  unskilled  labor  level  for  everyone  that  pans  out.  While reports  of  wage pressures  have  been  isolatedso  far, broader-based pressures  seem  incipient  given  thesedevelopments  in  labor  markets.Business  executives  in  the  District  are  also  seeing  evidenceof  price pressures  from  rising  costs  of  steel,  paper products,  and avariety of  raw materials  from both  foreign  and domestic  sources.Despite  continued  competition  in  product  markets  that  limits  theirability  to pass  on  costs,  it  would not  take much,  in  my judgment,  tocrystallize price  increases  in  such an  environment.  In  fact,  aninteresting  aside,  somewhat  contrary to  the  report  of  the view  of  theNational Association  of Manufacturers,  is  the view I am  getting  frommanufacturers  in  our  District.  They perceive  that  the  marketplacethey are  operating  in  is  so  competitive  that  to  enable  them  to  staycompetitive,  they would like  us  to  take  action  to  contain  what  theysee  as  emerging price  and wage pressures.9/27/94-28-One  final  area  I wanted to  comment  on  is  inventories.  Ofcourse,  many economists  have been  concerned  that  the  second-quarterbuildup  foreshadows  slower  demand  growth ahead.  However,  again  basedon  conversations  I have  had with  business  executives  in  the  EighthDistrict, my general  sense  is  that  the  buildup was  intended.  Let megive you  just  one example.  Last  week we  had  a meeting  outside  of  St.Louis,  and a manufacturer  of  steel  for  industrial  and commercialbuildings  with operations  not  only in  our District  but  the  upperMidwest  and the  West  told  me  that  his  lead  times  from  suppliers  arenow  two  to  three  times  above what he  would normally expect  and  that  hein  turn has  pushed out  his delivery  schedules  for  his  customers  toprobably twice  what  they  normally would be.  As  a  result,  to  preventfurther delays  in  meeting his  customers'  demands,  he  has  begun  toorder  raw materials  in  anticipation of  orders  that  really have  notmaterialized.  I will  say,  however,  that  when  I asked him whether hewas willing  to  build speculative  inventories based  on  the  prospect  offurther  increases  in prices  of  materials,  he  said no.  By the  way, hehas  seen  two  steel  price  increases  so  far  this  year  totaling  10  to  12percent  and another  increase  has been  announced and  seems  very likelyfor  the  beginning of  the year,  So  far,  all  that  is  going  on,  at  leastin  this  sample  of  one,  is  the building  of  additional  inventoriesagainst  expected  final  orders.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  is  a manufacturer of  what?

[SECTION]

MR.  MELZER.  Steel  products  for  industrial  and commercialbuildings--warehouses,  light  industrial  buildings,  strip  shoppingcenters,  that  sort  of  product.To  conclude,  I'm very  concerned  about  inflation no  matterwhat  measure  one  looks  at.  In  July and  August,  consumer pricesaccelerated  to  an  annual  rate  of  4.1  percent  and producer prices  to  anannual rate  of  more  than  6 percent.  Inflation  is  certainly headed inthe wrong  direction  if  price  stability  is  our  goal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR.  LAWARE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I suspect  that  the death  yesterdayof  the Administration's  health  care  reform scheme  may well  result  in  areversal  of  some  of  the  recent declines  in  consumer  confidence.  Onthe  other hand,  the  upcoming  election will  tend  to  focus  attention  onvoter  dissatisfaction with  government  and  support  continueduncertainty.  My  own view is  that  the  export  sector  may  in  fact  dobetter  than  the  Greenbook  forecast,  and  consumers may  continue recentspending patterns  more  strongly than  the  Greenbook projects.  Theabrupt drop  in  GDP  growth projected by  the  staff  for  1995  seems  to  meto  be  inconsistent  with  the projected levels  for  autos  and housingstarts.  As  a result,  I continue  to  believe growth  in  1995  will besomewhat  stronger  than  the  staff  forecast  and may  indeed requirefurther  restrictive  action by  the  Committee.  But  I'm not  convincedthat  we  have  yet  seen  the  full  impact  of  our previous  policy moves  orthat  the  future direction  of  policy is  clear enough at  this  timewithout  more hard data.  I certainly  admire  the  inflation  reductionand containment  achieved  in  some  other countries,  but  I find  thesocial price  paid in  those  countries  in terms  of  prolonged recessionand  very high unemployment unacceptable  for  the  United States.  Iwould rather  pursue  a more moderate  course  designed to  ratchet  coreinflation  down over  time  and not be  distractedly  concerned by9/27/94-29-occasional  temporary upward  blips  in  the  CPI.  Consequently,  I thinkwe  need more  information and  a very  sensitive  foot  on  the brakes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First,  very briefly aquick summary  of  where  I am:  The  inflation news  since  the  last  FOMCmeeting certainly  has  not  been  very helpful,  but  I don't  think thereis  much evidence  that  inflation  is  going to  take  off  on us.  We mayhave  some  inflation creep  on our hands  as  the  Greenbook  suggests,  andI'll  speak  a little more  to  that  in  a second.  In real  activity, asMike  Prell  and many others  have  observed, there  is  an  impressive  and,certainly  to  me  and perhaps  others,  a surprising  amount  of momentumstill  out  there  and that  may be  slowing.  When we  gathered  last  time,we  tightened  50  more basis points  and  that,  of  course,  is  only  justnow going  to  start  to  have  an  impact.  The  impact  of  earliertightenings  is,  of  course,  still  in  the process  of unfolding.  So  inshort,  I think we  have an  interlude here  to  see what  develops.  Theslowing may spread  and stretch  out  a little.  On  the  other hand, itdata  that  may call  for another move  rather  soon.If  I can  take  one  more minute, Mr.  Chairman, let  me  sharewith you  a concern  that  I have.  If  inflation  creeps  up  at  all,  and  itcertainly appears  that  that  is  likely, many here  could regard  that  asinsignificant  or  temporary and not  be  terribly concerned  about  it.But  I think we probably  need to  be  prepared  for  a rather major andstronger bout  of  inflation  jitters  in  the  economy, and we may want  tothink  about  how we  might be  able  to  handle  that.  There  is  aperception  that  the  economy is  in  a very mature,  perhaps  even  a  late,stage  in  the  cyclical  expansion.  Everyone perceives  that  we  areoperating more  or  less  at  capacity now.  For  a long  time  in  thiscountry, people  would expect  in  a period  like  this  to  see  inflationtake  hold and be  at  its  most virulent.  I think  that  until  we  actuallygo  through  a full  cycle without  a substantial  inflationary surge,there  is  going  to  be  a concern  that  history will  repeat  itself,  and  Ican  understand  that.  And if  inflation starts  to  show  some  upwardcreep,  there  almost  inevitably will  be  some  concern  that,  okay,  thegame  is  on, here  we  go  again.There  are  at  least  two  risks  in  that.  First  of  all,  it  couldhave  a certain self-fulfilling prophecy  element  to  it  through  theexpectations  channel  and  it  may make  itself  stronger  than  it  needs  tobe  or might  inherently be.  Second,  I can  see  it  forcing  long  ratesconsiderably higher  than we  are  comfortable with  or  think that  theyought  to  be  through  an  enlarged  inflation premium.  That  could be  anoverly and unnecessarily negative  event.  So,  I have  a concernregarding  what we  may be  looking  at  in  the marketplace  in  the nearfuture,  Mr. Chairman.  Even  if  we  are  not  terribly concerned based onthe  specific  evidence  that we  see  at  hand,  I think there  could be  somenegative  way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I agree with the  central  message  of  theGreenbook that  most  of  the  new  information  that  has  accumulated  duringthe  last  six weeks  points  to  continued  strength  in  aggregate demand.9/27/94-30-The  incoming data  do not yet provide  any  significant  evidence  of  asufficient  slowdown in  real  GDP growth.  However,  this  is  not based ona great  deal  of  evidence.  A  lot  more data  will  be coming  in  over  thenext  month that  will  clarify whether  this  impression  is  correct  ornot.  I personally am concerned  that we  have put  quite  a bit  ofrestraint  into  the pipeline,  a good share of  it  quite  recently, and  itadditional  100  basis point  rise  in  the  funds  rate,  I am  considerablymore pessimistic  than the  Greenbook  about the  1996  forecast  for  realgrowth.  For example,  in  the  MPS model  the  impact  of  such  a  tighteningbecomes  really discernible  only after  about  four  quarters,  namely byearly 1996.  And after eight  quarters,  such  a rise  would take about0.9  percent  off  real  GDP.  That  leaves me with a  sense  that  a  forecastof  2.2  or  2.3  percent  real  growth  in  1996  may be  overly optimisticwith that  added restraint.A key  question now concerns  the  behavior  of  prices--whetherthere is  evidence  at  this  stage  that  inflation  is  accelerating.  Thisin my view  is  an  especially  important  issue  given  our concern  withinflation as  an ultimate policy goal  and also  the  feeling  that  theeconomy  is  operating at  close  to  potential  where  there  is  a decidedrisk that  inflation  could begin  to  creep  up.  But  here my analysisdiffers  somewhat  from  the  staff  forecast.  In particular,  I think weare  seeing  and will  continue  to  see  for  a time  an  increase  in  therelative  prices  of  raw materials  and imported  goods.  These  higherprices  will  feed  through  into  the  CPI  for  a period of  time,  causing atemporary  increase  in  the rate  of  inflation but not  a permanentincrease  in  the  trend  inflation rate,  or worse yet,  an  acceleration ininflation.  I think  the  increase  in  inflation will  be  temporary evenif  there  is  only enough  restraint  to  hold  the  unemployment rate  at  itspresent  level,  roughly  the  natural  rate  given staff  estimates.  And Ithink the  markets  have  overreacted  to  the  increase  in  producer pricesin August.Now, the Greenbook  is  also  forecasting  that  consumer priceinflation will  be up  for  the  next  three  quarters  and  then will  returnto  roughly  3 percent by  the  end  of  1995,  and I agree with  thatforecast.  My difference with  the  Greenbook  concerns whether  or not  aperiod of  unemployment  in  excess  of  the  natural  rate  is  needed  to  getinflation  back into  line.  I think  not,  but  the Greenbook  thinks  thatit  will  require a period  of  unemployment  in  excess  of  the natural  ratein  the  latter  half  of  1995  and  1996  to  subdue  inflation, and  that'ssomething more  than a quibble  because  it  does  govern  one's view abouthow much  additional  restraint  it  is  going  to  take  to  hold  inflation  atits  present  level.To  elaborate  just  a bit,  I think we  are witnessing now aperfectly normal  cyclical phenomenon, namely,  the  relative prices  ofprimary commodities  and  raw materials  tend naturally to  increase  withthe  level  of  domestic  and more  importantly world  economic  activity.The prices  of  these  materials  have been  increasing  rapidly all  year,but  from initially  depressed levels.  I expect  these prices  to  risefurther  due  to  faster  global growth,  but  then  I expect  them to  stoprising  once  economic  activity  stabilizes.  Similarly, we have  had asignificant  depreciation of  the  dollar, which  is  causing and willprobably continue  to  cause  for  a  time a  rise  in  the  level  of  importprices.  But  the  staff  doesn't  expect  the  dollar  depreciation  to9/27/94-31-continue  and so  we  should  expect  import prices  also  to  rise  and  thenstop  rising.My  conclusion  is  that  these  shocks  should  feed  into  fasterCPI  inflation  only for  a  time,  and once  the  adjustment  is  complete,inflation should  revert  toward  its  previous  level.  I expect  this  tooccur  even  if  the  CPI  increase  feeds  partially  through  into  wages,although  the  greater  this  feedback, the  longer  this  temporary burst  ininflation will  persist.  I agree with Governor Kelley that  there  is  adanger  that  inflationary expectations  can overreact.  Historically, Ithink  the  evidence  on  the  likely pass-through of  temporary priceshocks  into wages  is  quite  inconclusive.The  only  caveat  I want  to  add  in  this  analysis  is  that  I'massuming  along with  the  Greenbook that  the unemployment  rate  is  notgoing to  be  allowed  to  fall  below the  natural  rate--and  that  means  notvery much lower  than it  currently  is--for  any significant period  oftime.  With  respect  to  the  question of  whether or  not  we are  below  thenatural  rate,  I think  wage behavior provides  the  best  direct  evidence.The  fact  that  wages  have been  so  well-behaved, with  average hourlyearnings  rising only  0.2  percent  last month,  for  example,  convinces  methat  we have not  overshot  the  natural  rate.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I have  only a  few points  to  make  and  sinceprobably half  the people  around  the  table  are  as  hungry as  I am,  Iwill  make  them quickly.  I wasn't  planning  to  say anything about  thetrade negotiations;  but  since  it  was brought  up,  and lest  silence beconstrued as  assent,  let  me  just  say that  I disagree  99-1/2  percentwith what  my colleague,  Governor Lindsey,  said in  his  assessment  ofwhat's  likely--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  means you  agree with him on  1/2percent?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I think 1/2  percent  is  on  track,  and  I'll  leaveit  at  tha.On  the  forecast,  largely  for reasons  having  to  do withinventories,  which I brought  up  at  the  last  FOMC meeting and certainlywith  the  staff,  I would look  for  the  third quarter  to  be  weaker thanin  the Greenbook.  By pure  arithmetic,  some  of  that  difference  isgoing  to  show up  in  a  stronger  fourth  quarter.  So,  this  is  not amajor disagreement.  But,  on balance,  it  leads me  to  a  somewhat weakersecond half  of  1994  than the  Greenbook  forecast.  Conversely,  I'dexpect  a bit  stronger  first  half  of  1995  than  the Greenbook.  Notethat  the projected  further  tightenings of  monetary policy built  intothe  Greenbook  forecast  could not possibly be  slowing down  the  economyin  the  first  half  of  1995.  So,  whatever  is  in  the  staff  forecast  forthe  first  half  of  next year has  to  have been built  in by  the previoustightenings.  I don't  think  we  have  tightened  enough to  slow  theeconomy down  to  1.8  percent  in  the  first  half  of  next  year.Accordingly,  I'd expect  the  first half  of  1995  to  be  a bit  strongerthan  in  the Greenbook.  But over  the next year  there may not be muchdifference  between the way  I see  things  evolving  and the way  theGreenbook sees  things  evolving  in  total.  Now,  for  the  eight  quartersin  1995  and  1996,  the  average growth  rate  in  the Greenbook  is  about  29/27/94-32-percent.  I don't  find  that  to  be  a very satisfactory  target.  If  wehave not  yet  overshot  capacity, and  I don't  believe  we  have  althoughone  can't  dismiss  that hypothesis  completely, the  economy does  notneed  to  grow at  2 percent  for  two  years  in  order  to  keep  inflationfrom  rising.  If  we have  already overshot,  then  indeed we  do needsomething  like  that.Regarding  inflationary pressures,  I think we  should realize,in  the  United States  right  now.  There  are  lots  of  stories  coming outof  the manufacturing core  of  the  economy about  tight markets,  verystrong  capacity utilization,  strong  order books,  good sales,  etc.They are all  true.  But  they  are very much concentrated  in durablesmanufacturing, which in  round numbers  is  10  to  12  percent  of  valueadded  in  the  U.S.  economy.  If  you  look at  the demand  side  rather  thanthe production  side  and  look back at  the  last  year,  we have hadbuoyant  growth  over  the  year, which  has  scared a  lot  of people.  Thefour  quarters  ending in  the  second quarter of  1994  had  a growth  rateof  4 percent.  It's  the  only time  that  we  have had a  four-quarterperiod with growth  as  high as  4 percent  in  this  entire  businessrecovery.  In previous business  recoveries,  one  four-quarter period of4 percent  would not  have  scared  anybody  and,  indeed, would  have  leftthe  FOMC  thinking  that  things  weren't  looking  that  great.More  important  than  the  4 percent,  I want  to  call  attentionto  the  fact  that  that  growth  was  highly  concentrated.  I looked  atthese  numbers  last  night.  I knew  the  qualitative  story,  but  I wassurprised  at  the  quantitative  dimension.  We  all  know where  it  wasconcentrated--in business  fixed  investment,  consumer  durables,  andhousing.  Those  three  sectors  account  for  roughly  1/4  of  GDP  on  thespending side.  I'm not  talking about  value  added weights  because  alot  of  that  is  imports,  which  is  a point  I'm coming  to.  Those  threesectors  of  the  GDP over  the  last  four  quarters  registered  an  11.3percent  rate  of  growth.  This  means  by  the  laws  of  arithmetic  that  therest  of  the  economy,  the  other  75  percent,  registered a  1.6 percentgrowth rate  over  that  period.  Those  three  sectors,  of  course,  leavingaside  housing  for now, are  where  the price  pressures  are--eithercurrent  or  incipient.  If  you  looked  at  the  Greenbook  forecast  for  thenext  two quarters  and  took  housing  out  of  the  fast-growing  sector,  theresult would be  even  more  extreme.  We don't  expect housing  to  be  partof  the  fast-growing  sector going  forward;  the  staff  doesn't;  none  ofus  do.  But,  leaving housing  in  the  fast-growing sector,  those  threesectors  in  the  Greenbook  forecast  are projected in  the  second half  ofthis  year  to  grow at  a  6 percent  rate  and  the  rest  of  the  economy  at  a1.8  percent rate.  If  I moved housing over  the  sectoral  line,  thatspread would be  exaggerated because we  are  expecting  a  slowdown  inhousing.Regarding the point  that  I was  making about  inflationarypressures,  many people  in popular  discussions point  to  internationalcapacity as  a  safety valve on U.S.  inflation.  This  is  greatlyexaggerated because roughly  90  percent  of  what  we consume  or use  isproduced at  home.  The place where  it  has  the  most validity, however,is  exactly where  the  pressures  are  right now--in business  fixedinvestment, where over  40  percent  is  imported, and  consumer  durableswhere  I don't  remember  the  fraction that  is  imported.  Those  areprecisely  the  sectors  where we  are  seeing pressure.  It  is  in  this9/27/94-33-very limited part  of  the  economy where  the  international  safety valveis  most  important.Finally,  I want  to  align myself  fully with  the  comments  JerryJordan made  earlier.  I have  been worried  for  some  time,  and  I ambecoming  increasingly worried,  about  the  disjuncture between  the MainStreet  view of  inflation  and the  Wall  Street  view of  inflation.  Ijust want  to  point  out  an  implication:  None of  us  is  sure  thisdisjuncture is  actually  a fact;  I suspect  it  is,  as  Jerry  does,  but  itis  hard  to  know  for  sure.  If  it  is  a  fact,  the  implication  is  thatreal  interest  rates  look  a lot  higher  on Main Street  than  they do  onWall Street,  and we  should be  mindful  of  that.  If  that  hypothesis  iscorrect,  that's  likely  to mean  that  there  is  more punch  in what wehave already done  than  we  realize.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Finally, Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I guess  I am  left  to  bat  clean-up  in an  era ofa baseball  strike,  and  I'm not  quite  sure where  that  leaves  me!  Theeconomy clearly is  going  into  the  fourth year  of  this  upturn and  thethird year with above-potential  GDP growth.  As  Governor  Blinder  justdescribed, we  are  seeing  a  lot  of  the  strength in  manufacturing  ofconsumer durables  and  in  business  investment, especially equipmentspending.  The  labor  markets  appear  very strong.  Job generation  hastotaled over  3 million  jobs  this  past  year.  Housing  activity clearlyhas  slowed.  The question  is  more  on  the  consumer  side.  We appear  tobe  seeing some  slowdown there.  As we  have  heard around  the  table,there  is  some disagreement regarding  the  extent  of  the  slowdown, whereit  is  and so  on.  Part  of  this  may be  that  consumers  have workedthrough  the bulge  in  their pent-up demands  following the  recession  andalso have  worked  through  the  housing  bulge when people  buy  lots  ofconsumer durables  following their  housing purchases.  I think mostpeople would suspect  that  we  should  be  seeing  some  slowdown.  I was  alittle  surprised  to  see  the  discussions  of  a potential  Christmas  spreespending now being reported.  The  international  picture  should bestrengthening and  at  least  not  be  a drag on  the  economy.  I certainlyrecognize  that  this  is  not  a large  part  of  the U.S.  economy because wehave  such  a large  domestic  economy.  Nevertheless,  looking  at  thesevarious  pressures,  it's  a bit  hard  to  escape  the  conclusion that  mostof  the  slack  in  labor  and product markets  is  used up,  and we  arestarting  to  see  the  effects  on  the  price  side.  I think  we  are  beyondthe  point  of  a preemptive  strike.  Barron's  yesterday was  even talkingabout  urging people  to  dig back  into  their closets  and find  their"Win" buttons.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  We  each have  one, Mr.  Chairman!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Then you  are  well  prepared.  I think some  ofthe  numbers  that  have  already been cited here  recognize  that  we  areseeing  some  show-through  of  price pressures  even  in  the  CPI,particularly  in  the  last  couple of  months.  We  have  all  been citingproducer  price pressures  in  the  last  few months,  and there  are  lots  ofgood statistics  to  quote with respect  to  producer  prices  and alsocommodity prices.  While much of  the  pressure  on  commodity prices  hasnot  shown through  to  final  consumption prices,  it  would neverthelessbe  a danger signal  if  commodity and  other producer prices  stayed  atelevated  levels  for  a sustained period of  time.  I think  it  isinteresting  that  the argument  on  inflation now appears  to  have shifted9/27/94-34-somewhat.  There  appears  to be  fairly broad acknowledgement  that  weare  seeing more price  increases.  The question now appears  to  bewhether the  increase  is  permanent  or  a short-term  cyclical blip.surface  this  argument.  But  I quote  Gary Stern's  stern warning aboutthe  problems  of  identifying whether  it  is  a blip  or whether  it  is  moreincipient  or  creeping price  increases,  something  that's  likely  toinfect  the  CPI  for  the  long term  and  in  fact move  on  into  the wagesector.Turning  to  the  financial market  side,  the  stock markets,  Ithink, have shown quite  amazing resilience  in  light  of  the  interestrate  increases.  Stock prices  are  being  sustained,  I think, byearnings  at  this  point,  so  we are getting  a healthier relationshipbetween prices  and earnings.  Bond markets  are  certainly nervous,  andI think  this  is  well  demonstrated by Peter Fisher's  art  work in  hischarts,  but  it's  not  the  wild roller  coaster  that  we  saw in  the  firstpart  of  this  year,  at  least  for  the  United States.  Bank  creditdone  and perhaps with  a mild caveat  for  mortgage markets,  the  capitalinvestment  and  expansion.Now, while  all  of  these  signs  for  the  economy  appear verystrong  and the  recent  revisions  have  been upward  as  is  certainly welldocumented in  the Greenbook,  I think  there  are  some clouds  on  thehorizon--the  so-called downside  risks.  We  have  already talked aboutthe  spending  slowdowns.  We  still  have  some pressures  in  the  laborand other  sources  of  fiscal  restraint  and  the  continuing need  toaddress  whether the  deficit  is  going  to  be  coming back into  play,particularly  for  the  out years.  Much  of  the  strength  that  we  haveseen,  I think,  is  dependent  on productivity gains,  and  it'squestionable  as  to whether  or not  we are  going  to  continue on  the1990s  trajectory  for productivity or whether we will  revert  to  the1980s  trajectory.  Balance  sheet  strains  could  reemerge  following  thestrong credit  growth and  the merger  and  acquisition activity that  weare  seeing.  Finally, I'd mention  the  monetary aggregates.  It's  hardto  believe  that  the  weakness  that  we  are  seeing  in  the monetaryaggregates  is  not  going  to  have  some effect.  On  balance,  I think theoutlook  looks  good, but  there  are  downside risks.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Don Kohn,  would you  start  us  off?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  [Statement--See  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Don?  If  not,  let  me  startout.  I  think the  evidence  is  fairly  solid  that  the  industrialmomentum  that  we have  been  seeing  in  recent  months  has  a head of  steambehind it;  we  can see  it  in  the  order books;  we  can see  it  in  thebacklogs;  it's  fairly widespread.  But  as  Governor Blinder pointedout,  the  growth in  industrial  production  this  year  clearly has  beenconcentrated to  a  significant  extent  in  durable  goods and  has been9/27/94-35-especially heavy  in areas  related  to  capital  goods.  But  these areasare where  inventories  are  rising most  and why  they  are crucial  tomeasures  of  industrial  pressures  and overall  pressures.  In  tracingthis  phenomenon over  the  last  year  or  two,  we  are  aware of  a veryrapidly dropping  inventory/sales  ratio when  calculated to  exclude  theratio  to  consumption have been  falling  at  a  fairly dramatic  rate untilvery recently.  Indeed,  the  decline has  been  enough  to  hold  the  levelof  real  inventories  to  a very slow growth path until  very  recently.As  we discussed at  previous  meetings,  all  we  have  to  do  arithmeticallyis  to  take  the  "just-in-time" decline  in  inventory/sales  ratios  andflatten  them out  and inventory  investment surges.  Indeed,  that  iswhat apparently  is  happening  at  this  stage;  it's  where the  second-quarter  run-up  in  GDP  occurred.I'm  a little  skeptical  that  the  reduction  in  the rate  ofinventory  investment  in  the  third quarter  is  going  to  be  all  thatsubstantial.  The  reason  rests  on  the  question  of  whether  increasingbacklogs  suggest  that  lead  times  are  stretching out,  as  Tom Melzerpointed  out  with respect  to  his  one-observation  sample.  Thestretching  out  is  confirmed by  the  lagged deliveries,  but  it  is  notconfirmed by  the  lead  times  that  are  reported by purchasing managers.So  it's  not  clear yet  exactly what  the  full  state  of  play is,  but  itis  clear that  lagged deliveries  tend historically to  have been a morepotent  indicator of  what  the  inventory situation  really  is.  In anyevent,  it's  quite  inconceivable  that  the August  industrial productionincrease of  0.7  percent  was  substantially or  all  an  increase  inconsumption.  There  is  no  evidence  of  that.  The implication  is  thatthere  was  a substantial  increase  in  inventories  in August  when  onefactors  in  reasonable  numbers  on  imports  and exports  of  variousindustrial materials.That's  not  the  same  thing  as  saying  that  that  is  what  isgoing  to  show  up  in  the  deflated book value  data.  The  inventoriesimplied in  the  industrial production  numbers  or  the  real  inventorydata produced  for autos,  oil,  some  steel,  and a variety of  otheractually measured  totals  don't  quite  square with  the  book value  data,which  tend  to  be  a little  flaky.  My  suspicion is  that  the  deflationprocess  is  very tricky  as  one  goes  from  book value to  constantdollars;  it's  a weak  statistic.  But  I think both  sets  of  data,whether  one  is  deriving  them  from  the  industrial  data  themselves  orfrom  the book value  data,  show  that  the  decline  in  inventory/salesratios has  come  to  a halt  and may very  likely be  tilting  up  ever  soslightly  at  this  particular  stage.  This  is  what  one would expect  asthe  economy begins  to  approach capacity  limits  and backlogs  begin  tostretch  out.  The normative  desired  levels  of  inventories  tend to  risebecause  obviously if  firms  are  trying  to protect  their productionschedules,  the  time  it  takes  to  get  deliveries  of  new materials  fromsuppliers will  largely dictate  what  we  used to  call  "safety stocks"  inevaluating  the  inventory situation.  Safety  stocks  at  this  stage areprobably rising  slightly.  There  is  no  evidence  of  major  shifts,  butit's  very unlikely with  the backlogs picking up  as  they  are  that  thesesafety  stock numbers  are  not moving  at  least  somewhat  higher.  Thissuggests  that  the  second-quarter number, while  it  may be  somewhat  hardto  interpret,  is  not  in  any regard  suggesting  an  overhang ofinventories or providing  any evidence  that  those  inventoryaccumulations  are  unintentional.  If  they were, we would  see  it  in  theorders  data.  Although  it  may well  be  that  the  data we will  see9/27/94-36-tomorrow  for durable  goods  orders  will give  us  a  different  signal  thanwe  have been getting,  to  date  there's very  little  in the  anecdotalreports  or  in  other data  that  suggests  that  orders  have simmered downin  any material way.The  question on  which I  think we  have to  focus  at  this  pointis  whether  there  is  an  inventory  recession  threat  at  the  end  of  thiscycle.  Because  if  there  is  a significant  pickup  in  inventories  thatis  perceived to  be  voluntary, past  history has  always  raised thequestion  as  to  whether  that pickup  is  overdone.  It  is  unlikely, Imight  say,  that  monetary policy can restrain  inventory accumulation byhigher  short-term interest  rates.  The  reason basically is  that  sinceinventories  are  there  to protect production  schedules,  thecontemplation of  inadequate  stocks  at  any particular  time  weighs veryheavily  on purchasing policies.  There  would need to  be  someextraordinarily high  interest  rates  to  impede  the  accumulation ofinventories when  they  are perceived  to  be  necessary for  sustainingproduction.  In any event,  it's  fairly obvious  that  we are not  dealingwith  a loan  availability problem because with  the very high  degree  ofsecurities  holdings  by the  commercial  banking system we can  get a verylarge  loan/deposit  ratio  increase  with a big  shift  from  securitiesinto  loans  and no bank  credit  expansion.  So  the  factors  subduinginventory  accumulation have  to  come  from  the  final  sales  side.  Ifthere  is  an  effect,  it's  got  to  be  because  residential  constructionand existing home  sales  are  slowing down, with  the  result  that  salesof  household durables  are  slowing down.  This means  the  realizedcapital  gain  on  the  sale  of  existing homes  that  has  a big  impact  ondurable  goods  spending is  also going  down.  When  that  sort  of  thinggets  going,  inventories will  back up very  quickly.  Consequently,  theconcern  that  one might  have  that  the  inventory building will  beoverdone and  lead  to  an  inventory  recession  a year  or  two  out  becomesessentially moot.Price pressures  are  building  with the  rise  in backlogs  anddelayed deliveries.  But  I must  say I was  somewhat  impressed--I  don'tknow if  my memory is  faulty--that while  everyone  around  the  table,with  few exceptions,  was  talking  about  stronger  activity, even  if  youchose different  words,  I did read your  comments  on  inflation  asimplying  slightly  less upward pressure  on prices.  There  wassurprisingly little  talk of  more price  pressures  around  the  room.  I'mnot  sure  one  can make very much of  this,  but  if  prices were  in  theprocess of  accelerating at  this  stage,  I think we would  have heardmore around  the  room on  that  point.  But  that  is  scarcely a  scientificjudgment.One other  important  issue  that  I think we  probably  ought  tofocus  on  at  this  stage  is  the  extent  to  which profit margins  arerising.  They are  moving up,  or at  least  they had moved up  at  a veryabrupt  rate until  very early  this  year,  which  is  another way of  sayingthat  unit  consolidated costs  have  been  rising much  less  than  prices.Indeed,  if  one  looks  at  the  data,  as  inadequate  as  they  are  in  thenational  income accounts,  we  are  getting  a spread of  well  over apercentage point  in  the  rate  of  change between unit  costs  on  the  onehand and prices  on  the  other.  What  that  suggests  is  that productivityobviously is  moving  up  and unit  labor  costs  are  being contained.  Thediscussion we had previously  indicated  that  the  rising  costs  of  rawmaterials  were not  moving  into  final  goods prices  and  that  thoserising  costs  are  being  absorbed by  the  subdued behavior  of unit  labor9/27/94-37-costs.  But  the presumption  that  there  has  been no pass-through at  allis  belied by  the  fact  that  margins  are  opening up.  When margins  openup,  what we are  observing  is  in  effect  an  ability on  the  part  of  a lotof  producers  to  move  the price  level.Now, we  are  saying  that  inflation  is  3 percent.  Well,  3percent  is  not a small  number;  it  is  not  small  over  the  long run inthe  consumer area.  But  granted  it  is  not  that  good,  it  is  less  thanthat  for  goods  at  the  final  CPI  level;  it  is  probably more  than  thatat  the  PPI  level.  I was  a  little  concerned, even  though  in the  lastpublished report  the  CPI  was  reasonably contained,  that  the  PPI  corenumber was  somewhat higher.  Moreover,  it  apparently was  being helddown by  still  faulty  seasonal  adjustments,  at  least  if  we  take  ourdoubly  seasonally adjusted processes  to  heart.  If  we  doublyseasonally  adjust  the  seasonally  adjusted rate  of change  of  core  PPIinflation,  the  last observation was,  I think,  at  least  0.1  percenthigher  than  the published number.  So  I think what we are  observing  isthe  opening  up  of  margins  in  much of  the underlying  structure.  Butunit  labor  costs  apparently have  been so  well  contained byproductivity gains  at  this  stage  that  cost  pressures  have  not  flowedinto  final  goods  prices.The  question  that  we  confront at  this  stage that  has  beenraised at  this  table,  really  for  the  first  time  in  a broad  sense--itstarted with  Bob Forrestal  and everyone  just  sort  of  picked  it  up--isthe  possibility of  a short-term blip  in  the  final  goods price  data.If  we  look at  business  cycle patterns,  we  usually  find that  there  is  acycle  in prices.  The  question  that  we  have  to  ask ourselves  is  howmuch we  care.  How much are we  concerned about  it  so  long  as  the  peak-to-peak  inflation  rate  in  the business  cycle  gets progressively lowerand  the  trough-to-trough level  of  price  inflation gets  progressivelylower?  That  implies  a long-term  downtrend.  But  as  a number  ofcomments  around  this  table  have  indicated, we  can not  make  the  simplepresumption  that we  can get  an  inflation blip  and  say  "Well, it's  ablip."  The  trouble  with most  blips  is  that  they  can be  identified  assuch  only in  retrospect.  There are  far  more  announced blips  thatturned  out  to  be permanent  changes  than  there  are  blips  in  thehistorical record.  So,  we  have  to be  very  careful  about  viewing  ablip  as  something that  doesn't  give us  considerable  concern.However,  it  is  true,  with profit  margins  up  to  the  highestlevels we have  seen  in  well  over  a decade,  that  if  pressures  begin  toincrease  the rate  of  growth  in  unit  costs,  history also  suggests  thatthere  is  a  tendency  for profit  margins  to  start  downward  in  the  laterstages  of  the  cycle.  So  there  is  a good deal  of  potential  absorptionof  final  prices here  that  could  occur  as  a consequence  of  decliningthe  Greenbook, and  as  a consequence,  while  the  staff  forecast has  avery modest  acceleration  of  inflation,  implicitly  the underlying costsobviously are  accelerating at  a  far  faster pace.  I think that  is  areflection  of  an  expectation of  a slowdown  in productivity gains,which  to  date have been  the major  factor  in  suppressing  the pass-through to  final  prices.As  a consequence  of  all  of  this,  one  has  to  ask why we  arethis  far  into  the business  cycle  expansion without  the  types  of  pricepressures  that we  have  seen  on previous  occasions.  I raised this  asan  issue  before,  and I'm beginning  to  suspect  that  we  are  going  to9/27/94-38-find out whether or not  the  extraordinarily  still  muted money andcredit  aggregates  really matter.  In other words,  we are  approaching  apoint  where we will  get  interesting  tests  as  to whether  inflation is  aPhillips  curve phenomenon  or  a monetary phenomenon.  If  we  look  at  itfrom  a Phillips  curve  point  of  view or  its  equivalent,  slack  in  theindustrial  area,  then we  are  on  the  edge  of  some  severe  inflationarypressure  if  we  are getting  rising  inventory accumulation.  If,however,  we  think  that prices  are a monetary phenomenon, we  are morelikely  to  see  the  types  of  changes  that  occurred prior  to  the  1930swhere we  had  a noninflationary  long-term environment  largely  locked  inby the  gold standard, but  periods  of  significant  pressure  during whichinflation  never really  took hold, because  the  credit  aggregates  neverreally  took hold, as  they  couldn't  in  that  type of  environment.  So,this  particular  business  cycle  may be  about  to  tell  us  a  lot  or,  Ifear,  it  may be mushy where  the  end result  will  be  somewhere  inbetween,  so  we won't  learn very much.  Reality  tends  to  do  that  to  usmore  often  than not!I do  think, as  a number  of  you have  mentioned, that  the  issueof  the  subnormal  growth  in monetary  and  credit aggregates  has  to  meansomething.  There  is  something  there.  We  have  argued  that  M2  or M1are  awful  as  indicators and  that  the monetary base  is  terrible,  but  weare  in  the business  of  creating money.  We  are  a central  bank.  If  wethink  all  of  that  is  beside  the  point,  I  think we've  got  to  worryabout a number  of  things  we  are  doing.  It  may turn  out  that  it'sbeside  the  point, but  I don't  think we  can make  that  presumption.My impression of  what  is  going  on,  pending the  outcome  ofthis  academic  debate,  is  that  we  have  to  assume  that  the pressures  arethere;  the  risks  of  making  alternate  assumptions  I think  are  just  toodangerous.  If  that  is  in  fact  the  case,  I would agree with thestaff's  version  that  more monetary policy restraint  is  probably  to  beexpected.  The  reason  is  that we  have  seen  stronger  GDP  growth than wehad anticipated and we  won't  know until  1995  or beyond  if  what  we  arelooking at  is  a situation where monetary policy suddenly has  turnedweaker  as  a  restraining  force,  maybe  because  of  the  inventorysituation, or  if  the policy  is  as  strong  as  ever  but  just  moredelayed.  We  may find  that  there  is  some  significant new underlyingstrength in  the  economy,  which  is  offsetting what has  been asignificant  impact  from monetary policy actions  already  taken.  It  istrue  that  there  are  significant  lags  in monetary policy, but rememberthese  are  distributed  lags.  It's  not  that  nothing happens  for  a yearor  15  months  and  then  suddenly  the  effect  is  felt.  There  is  a gradualprogression  of  effects.  We  have  to  presume  at  this  particular  stagethat  we  are  running under  the  projected  impact.  If  we  assume  that  ourjudgment  about  the basic  economy's  underlying strength  ex monetarypolicy has  not  changed significantly,  that  assumption  is  ratherdubious.  But what  this  suggests  is  that we  do  know something  aboutthe  effects  of monetary policy  actions  to  date;  we  know  that  theireffects  are  there  and moving.  What we  don't  know, and  will  not  fullyknow until  1995  and  later,  is  how powerful  in  retrospect  theunderlying  expansionary  forces were.My own  impression  of  all  of  this  is  that  I suspect we aregoing to  need  to move  further  somewhere  along the  line.  I would doubtvery much  that  the  degree  of  restraint  that  is  in  the  pipeline  at  thisstage,  including  the  significant rise  in  long-term interest  rates  overand above what would ordinarily be  expected from  short-term  interest9/27/94-39-rate  changes,  is  enough  to  give us  the  type  of  more subdued--excusethe  expression--"soft  landing"  that  we  would all  like  to  see.  I  thinkthat  the  subdued money  and credit  growth  does  suggest  that  we  are  notparticularly behind  the  curve.  It's  a  difficult  judgment  to  make,  andone  that  I don't  think we have  strong  analytical  tools  to  give us  anyinsight  into.We  have  another  issue  here  that  has  been  raised by a numberof  people.  Because  of  our  statement  "for  the  time  being"  in  our  lastmove on  August  17--which most  people  interpreted  to  mean that  we wouldnot move  at  this  meeting and would not move until  the  November  15thmeeting--we have  to  have  strong evidence  to  move more  quickly.  Mysuspicion  is  that  we probably  could get  through  to  the  November  15thmeeting.  If  we  do  move  then,  I think  that  would probably  require  usto  move  another  50  basis points  and probably move  the  discount  rate  aswell.My own  inclination  at  this  stage  is  to  go  with  "B" but  beasymmetric  for  the  reason that  Don  Kohn was  mentioning, namely, wehave  a good deal  of  data coming  in  around the  middle  of  October  thatcould very readily  indicate  that  our underlying  view of  the momentumof  the  economy was  too  soft  and  that  this  expansion  is  acceleratingfaster  than we had  expected.  If  that  occurs--if  the data  are  anundesirable  surprise--there will  be  significant market  turmoil.  Andif  we  allow  it  to  simmer  for  the whole  month  until  the  next meeting--remember,  this  is  a seven-week  interval--I  think it  could createinflationary expectations  that  might be  more  difficult  to  rein  in  thanif  we  moved in mid-October.  What  I'm saying  is  that  at  this  stage  weare getting  close  to  the point where  the data  do  matter because  we'vebeen under  restraint  long  enough  that  we  should begin  to  see  somesigns  of  its  slowing  impact  on  the  expansion.  If  we  don't  start  tosee  that  pretty soon,  that  will  suggest  that  this  economy  is  notgrowing  at  3 percent  but  closer  to  4 percent.  It's  not  all  thatdifficult  to  engender  that  type  of  outlook.  Now, I think  that's a  lowprobability  outcome,  but  I don't  think  it's  one  that  can  be  readilydismissed.I have  come  to  the  conclusion, and  I'd  like  to  lay  it  out  fordebate,  that  we  should not move  today.  We  don't  have  to  and  I don'tthink  it's  appropriate  to  move  today.  We  should be prepared  to  moveif  necessary  before our  next meeting,  but hopefully we  will  be  able  toget  through  to  the  next meeting.  If  we  are  able  to  do  that,  I thinkwe  will  probably have  managed policy better  than  we have  any reason  tobelieve we  should  be  able  to  do.  Obviously,  if  the  numbers  come  outin  an adverse  way, we  will  be  on  a telephone  conference as  usual  forthe  type  of  consultation and  discussion that  we have  had  in  the  past.Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman,  from what  we know andcan observe  today and based on  the  discussion  around  the  table,  Ithink  the  right  thing  to  do  today  is  to  retain  interest  rates  at  theirpresent  level.  I think we  have  removed all  the  accommodation  frommonetary policy and are  the  closest we  can  get  to  a neutral  position.I believe we  removed  it  at  the  right  time and  along the  right  firmingpath.  It  is  possible  that  the  risks  may be  essentially balanced,  butthey probably are  not.  Therefore,  I think an  easing of  interest  ratesbefore  the  next meeting  is  highly unlikely,  and a tightening  ofmonetary policy  could be  called  for by  incoming  data over  the9/27/94-40-intermeeting period.  Therefore,  I agree with your recommendation  thatan  asymmetric  directive  tilted  toward  tightening  is  appropriate.I do  not believe  that  the  statement  that  we made  after  thethought  it  was  the  right  thing  to  do.  I'm against  tightening  todaybecause  I don't  think it  is  the  right  thing  to  do.  That  statementshould not make  us  feel  at  all  unwilling  to  change monetary policybetween  meetings  if  the  data  indicate  that  is  the  appropriate  step  totake.  I do  believe making  such  statements  makes  sense;  I think  thestatement we made  in August  served  a useful  purpose.  But  the  incomingdata  in  the meantime  may lead  one  to  believe  that waiting  until  theam not  at  all  convinced that  the  credibility argument  demands,  becausethere's  a greater  probability of  a tightening move  than we might havethought  at  the  last  meeting, that  we  have to  tighten  today.  When  thenext move  takes  place, as  you already mentioned in your  presentation,it  would  likely be a move  of  50  basis  points.  I agree  very  stronglythat  that  would be  the  appropriate move--that  it  should be  either  zeroor  50.  I think a  25  basis point  move,  if  that  should present  itselfas  an  idea  to  anybody, could very easily  and almost  certainly would beinappropriately construed as  either  indicating a  degree  of  timidity,which would not  reflect  the  view of  the  Committee,  or worse  stillwould indicate  a compromise.  So  then  somebody  could write  a learnedarticle  about  the hawks  and the  doves  and who  did what  to whom,  andthat  at  the  end of  the  day we  did 25  basis points  because  we  couldn't

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mean the  hawk  and the  dove combineas  a  turkey.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So,  Mr.  Chairman,  I firmly  agreethat  "B"  tilted  toward  tightening  is  the  appropriate policy decision.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would support  yourrecommendation.  However,  I would note  that  there  are  inflationarypressures  in  train.  I think  they are  fairly  evident,  and we might bewell  served  if  we  were  to  act  sooner.  Therefore,  I would  support yourasymmetric proposal,  and if  the  data  come  out  at  all  strong,  I wouldencourage you  to  move  before  the November  meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I'd  also  like  to  support  your  recommendationand  just  say a  few  things.  I do  take  seriously  the  fact  that  we,  soto  speak, gave  our marker  in  August,  and we  should only be willing  totake  that  marker back  if  the  evidence  was  overwhelming  that  wecouldn't  wait.  I think  the  evidence  is  not close  to  overwhelming.The  first  sentence  of  the  second paragraph  of  the  Greenbook said  "thelargest  effects  of  the  interest  rate  increases  to  date may yet  lieahead, but  whether  they will  prove  sufficient  to  prevent  a buildup ofinflationary pressures is  unclear  at  this  juncture."  I think that  isexactly right;  I agree  with  that  100  percent.  That  says  to me  that"B" asymmetric  is  the  right policy.  We  have  to  remember  that  most  ofthis  restraint  is  probably  still  in  train  and the  price  effects willcome  even  later.  I want  to  be  clear--the  reason  that  I support  the9/27/94-41-asymmetry  is  not  that  I think  there  is  a strong  presumption that weare  going  to  have  to move  between meetings.  We might;  but  as  Billjust  said, the probability  that  we're  going  to  reduce  interest  ratesbefore  the next  meeting  is  zero.  The probability that  we  are  going  totighten  is  certainly not  zero,  and  that  for me makes  it  sensible  tohave an  asymmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman,  since  I believe  that  a blip  isa blip  is  a blip,  I would support  your  recommendation.  I,  too,  don'tthink we're  going  to  need  to  move  in  the  intermeeting period, but  Ithink it's  wise  to  have  the  asymmetry  as  an  insurance policy.  I agreewith your proposal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I'm comfortable with  leaving  the  funds  rateunchanged at  4-3/4  percent.  I don't prefer  asymmetric directives.  Iwould not  dissent  from  it,  but  I have  two  concerns  about  it.  One  isthat  an  asymmetric directive  toward  restraint  tends  to  get  theCommittee  associated with being anti-growth.  That's  because we haveto  react  to  incoming data  and  the psychology of  the  market  is  drivenby  the perception  of  those  data  in  a context  that  tends  to  cast  theCommittee  as  being anti-employment  or anti-growth.  Since  I don'tthink the purchasing  power of money is  reduced by more  output or  moreemployment,  I have  trouble with  that.  My  other concern  is  worryingthat  the  asymmetry  is  going  to  wind up being  cited prematurely in  somepublication  or wire  service  as  an  indication that  we  have  cocked  thegun again,  and  if  that  happens,  I won't be  very happy  about  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You  are  against  the  whole notion  ofasymmetry  in  the  directive?

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Yes.  I think  it  gets  us  into  a  lot  of  troublebecause  of  the  way  it  gets  interpreted.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  obvious  that  since  ourlast  meeting, pressures  on capacity  in product  and  labor markets havegrown as  have  prospects  for  higher  inflation  in  the  future.  Thus,  itseems  to  me  that we  should  raise  the  funds  rate  again  fairly  soon.  Idon't  think we  have  to  do  it  today,  but  I certainly would prefer anasymmetric directive  tilted  toward raising  the  rate  if  incoming dataimply greater  pressures  for  future  inflation.  Thus,  I would acceptyour  recommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Lindsey.

MR.  LAWARE.  I support  your  recommendation, Mr.  Chairman.  Ihope  that  in  casting my vote I will  be  resolving  in  my own mind  that9/27/94-42-the Committee  not be  inhibited in any way  in  the  timing  of  a move bythe  proximity of  the  election.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I agree with your  recommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman, I continue  to  think the  economyhas  a  lot  of  momentum.  In  this  situation, it  seems  to  me  thatinflation  expectations are  rising.  The bond rate  is  now at  itshighest  point  since  the  1990-1991  recession.  I don't  know what  thecurve  looks  like--I've never seen  it.  I'm not sure  what  its  characteris,  but I  think we are  still  behind  it.  I think we are  going  to  haveto  move  further, and  frankly  I just don't  see  a  compelling reason  todelay that  move.  On  the  contrary,  there  is  at  least  some risk  in  notacting  at  this  stage.  Aggregate demand is  strong and  in  that  kind ofsituation, especially  if  it  strengthens  further,  inflation pressuresinevitably are  going  to  grow, and  inflationary expectations  will  grow.Against  that  background,  if  past experience  is  any  guide at  all,  thatcould eventually put us  in a  situation where  all  the  choices  are bad.We  have been  there  before, and  it's  no  fun.  So,  I would prefer  tomove.  My choice would be  alternative D.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  "D"?

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  "D" as  in  David!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I  find myself  in  substantial  agreement with AlBroaddus  and  for many of  the  same  reasons.  It  seems  to  me  that  theeconomy has a good deal  of  momentum.  I'm not  at  all  confident  that  weare  moving  toward  a sustainable  path at  this  point.  I think thebanking system  is  in  the process  of  supporting rapid growth,  and  thisbalance  sheet,  just  a change  in  composition.  I think  the  evidencesuggests  that,  so  far  at  least,  we  have  not  moved particularly earlyor particularly  forcefully relative  to  historical  experience,  so  I'mnot persuaded that  we're  ahead  of  the  curve.  Finally,  I hope  I'mwrong when  I say this,  but  I'm concerned about  our ability  to  analyzethe price  data and come  up  with all  these  fine  reasons  why  somethingunusual  is  going  on  and  the  rise  in  prices won't  last.  We  can tellthose  kinds  of  tales,  but  I must  say that  that  kind of  analysis  hasled to  past policy errors,  and  I'm  afraid  I'm  reminded of  one  of  YogiBerra's  expressions  about  "deja vu  all  over  again."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I find myself very much  torn at  this  stage.  Ihave  a great deal  of  sympathy  for what  both  President Broaddus  andPresident  Stern have said.  I feel,  given  that  the  economy has  beenoperating near  full  capacity  for  some  months  now  and that  thestatistics  keep  coming  in much  stronger  than  we anticipated, that  thedata  over  the  next  couple  of  weeks  are  likely to  be  strong.  On  theother hand, while  I think  the  risks  are  on the  up  side,  the  timing  offurther  increases  is  something  that  has  both an  economic  component  to9/27/94-43-it  and  a political  component  to  it.  I would  trust  your judgment  inthis  sense  that  maybe  the  best  timing would be  a little  later.  So,  Iwould be  in  favor  of  your  recommendation.  I think the  risks  are  onthe  up  side.  I think it's  likely  that  we'll  move during  theintermeeting period.  So,  I would be  in  favor  of  the  asymmetry aswell.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I support  your recommendation, Mr.  Chairman,  andI do  trust  your  judgment  on  timing,  although  I would like  to  associatemyself with Jerry Jordan  on my general  feelings  toward  asymmetricdirectives.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I think a  tightening probably  is  going  to benecessary at  some point,  but  again  the  question  is  when.  I do  givecredence to  this  question of  credibility, and  it  seems  to  me  that  theevidence is  not  persuasive  that  we  need  to  move  now.  I prefer  to  givethe  tightening  that's  in  the pipeline  a chance;  again,  I'd cite  themonetary aggregates.  So,  I agree  with alternative  B and beingprepared to  move.  On balance,  I'm not  enamored with  asymmetry, but  Ithink the  chances  of  tightening  in  the  intermeeting period  are morelikely.  So,  I'd  support  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I'd  favor  "D" combined with a discountrate  increase;  I'd do  the  50  basis points  now.  I think  it's necessaryto  contain  the  emerging  inflationary pressures,  and  I also  think  it'snecessary  to  make  longer-term progress  toward price  stability.  Ithink,  as  you and others  have  observed,  that waiting  simply makes  ourjob more  difficult  and raises  questions  about  credibility.  I guess  Iinterpret  financial  market  developments  much  as  Al  Broaddus  did.  Withthe  bond rate  at  the  highest  level  since  the  recession  and moresensitivity in  foreign exchange  markets,  I think  credibility  is  anissue.  To  the  extent  we  lose  it,  it  makes  this  process much moreexpensive  for  everybody.  It's  not  just  a matter  of  the  credibility  ofthe  institution;  what  really matters  is  how  it  impacts  the  real  world.9/27/94-44-I think  to  the  extent we maintain  our credibility, longer  rates willbe  lower  than  they  otherwise would be.With  respect  to  the  language,  I personally  think  there havebeen significant  developments,  and  I think there  is  a  danger  in  thatsort  of  language.  One  can make  the  argument  that  the  existence  ofthat  language  actually has  undermined  some  of  our  credibility becauseof  concerns  about whether  in  fact  we  would  act  on  a timely basis.  Theinformation  in  terms  of  the  real  economy, prices,  and  financialfar  as  I'm concerned.Let me make  one  final  comment  about  the  monetary  aggregates.I, too,  would normally be  quite  concerned about  the  very slow growthof  the  narrower aggregates  in  1994--as  you know  I tend to  focus moreclosely  on  the narrower  aggregates  that  we can  actually  influence--but  I think their  growth has  to be viewed in  the  context  of  atremendous  monetary impulse  in  1991  through  1993.  You have  heard mesay it  before,  but  the  base grew  $100  billion over  that  3-year period.I think  in  a sense  there  is  a  liquidity overhang and  that  needs  to  getworked off.  I might  also  observe--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Does  that  include  U.S.  currency abroad?

[SECTION]

MR.  MELZER.  Yes,  that  would be  in  the base.  But  in  anyevent,  I view that  as  a very stimulative  impulse,  the  effects  of  whichwas mid-1988  to  mid-1989--we also  had very slow growth  in  the  base  andreserves  for  about  a  1-year period.  That  was  on  top  of  two  prioryears  of  very  sluggish growth  in  the narrower  aggregates.  So  myfeeling would be  that,  yes,  growth of  the narrow  aggregates  has  beenslow,  but  in  the  scheme  of  things  it  hasn't  been all  that  slow forthat  long.  I might  also  observe  that  there  are,  as  you well  know,some  very significant  technical  factors  that  are  impacting Ml,including  in particular  the mortgage  refinancing phenomenon.  Ourguess  is  that  that  took  7 percentage  points  of  growth out  of  M1  inprobably  is  growing somewhere  in  the  area  of  4 to  5 percent.  Butwe'll  see.  I don't  think  on  a  short-run basis  these  aggregates  areparticularly helpful  to  us  in  any  event.  I think they have  to belooked at  over  long periods  of  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Okay,  I think  the modal  consensus  is  on"B" asymmetric.  Would you  read the  language?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I'll  be  reading  the wording on  page  13  in  theBluebook:  "In  the  implementation of  policy for  the  immediate  future,the  Committee  seeks  to maintain  the  existing degree  of  pressure  onreserve positions.  In  the  context  of  the  Committee's  long-runobjectives  for price  stability  and  sustainable economic  growth, andgiving  careful  consideration  to  economic,  financial  and monetarydevelopments,  somewhat  greater  reserve  restraint would or  slightlylesser reserve  restraint might be  acceptable  in  the  intermeetingperiod.  The  contemplated reserve  conditions  are  expected  to  beconsistent  with modest  growth  of  M2  and M3  over  the  balance of  theyear."

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  say  that  under  our new procedurefor  announcing  our  decisions,  Don Kohn  thinks  that  2:15  p.m. is  theappropriate  time  to  announce anything  coming out  of  the meeting,including  a statement  such as  we have  made  in the  past  that  no  actionwas  taken.  We violated  that  last  time  largely  because we  finished ourmeeting early and  a lot  of  staff  members  came  into  the  Board  Room fromoutside,  and  security was  an  issue  at  that  point.  So,  I request  thatno  one mention anything  that  occurred within  this  meeting even  to  yourassociates outside  until  the  2:15  p.m. announcement  time  when JoeCoyne,  I gather, will  be making  the  statement  that  the meeting  isover.  Is  that  correct?
