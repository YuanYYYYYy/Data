CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Since  the members  are all here, I propose that we move up the starting  time of the meeting to 1:25  p.m.  Hearing  no objection,  I consider the meeting  to be in order.  The first item on the agenda  is approval  of the minutes for the May  19  meeting.  Does somebody  wish to move them?

SEVERAL.  So move.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  exception, they  are  approved.  The Board's  public information  officer traditionally has served as  an  assistant secretary of the Federal  Open Market Committee.  You all know Lynn Fox.  I  assume that  all of us presume  she is qualified,  and therefore  I would request  that somebody nominate her.

MS. RIVLIN.  I so nominate  her.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I second the nomination.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If there is  anybody  opposed, I don't want to hear it.  [Laughter]  Nominations  are closed,  and congratulations,  Lynn.  Peter Fisher.  

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to three front of you,  I hope.  The first page  shows the  3-month Euro-deposit rates  including the current, 3-month forward,  and 9-month  forward rates  since July  1 of last year.  This chart therefore  covers  the  12-month period since the start of the Asian  crisis.  1/ Copies  of the charts  used by Mr. Fisher are  appended to the transcript.  (Appendix  1)6/30-7/1/982In the  top panel  for the U.S.  dollar rates,  you can see  that most recently those rates have  continued their gentle  decline from their peak on  April  27  at the time of the Wall  Street Journal article.  The  decline was  punctuated more recently  by the market's  reaction  to the Chairman's  testimony before  the Joint Economic  Committee on June  10.  I will  come back  to that in  a moment.  That leaves  the  forward rates right on  top of the current  3-month rates, which  is the same  state  of affairs  that exists  in Japan,  as you  can see in the  bottom panel.  If you look at  German rates over the course of the  year since the start  of the Asian crisis--shown  in the  middle panel--your  first impression  may be that Europe  has been  going its own  way.  Rates rose in  the second half of 1997 and maintained  a  bit more  of a spread  between  current and  forward rates in contrast to the dollar  and yen rates.  But  on a second and closer look, I think one can  see  that since December  1997  German  rates  have  tended to move  in the  same direction  as U.S.  rates;  they declined  in December  and from late April  to the  present.  Their recent  downdrift  is attributed  to the anticipation  of a larger  Asian  effect  on the European  economy  and therefore the perception  of a reduced  likelihood  of rate rises over the remainder  of the year from the NCBs  in  advance of the ECB taking over on January  1st.  As this  gentle downdrift  has occurred  in the  last couple  of weeks, the  mark has weakened  slightly against  the dollar.  The  bottom panel  indicates  that money market rates in Japan  in general and the Japan premium in  particular have  backed  up quite  sharply in the  past few  days.  The  backup has occurred even  though the  Bank of Japan has been quite generous  in its term operations  in the  1- and  3-month areas,  but they again  have been  draining  shorter maturities  measured  in days and weeks.  The widening  of the various measures  of the  Japan  premium  began  about two weeks ago  as Nippon  and Long Term Credit Bank problems  came  to the surface.  It is interesting  that the widening  accelerated  from  last Friday to Monday  after the  announcement  that there might  be a merger between Sumitomo Trust and Long Term Credit Bank.  Turning to the next page,  there are  three  panels that I  will first describe  and then  go over  my thoughts about  them.  The first panel  shows the  dollar/yen  in green  with the  scale  on the right  side and the dollar/mark in blue with the  scale  on the left side.  The  middle panel shows  constant maturity U.S. Treasury yields  of 2,  10,  and 30 years.  The bottom  panel shows the currency  values  of seven  currencies  against  the dollar.  Those currencies  are indexed  to April  10, which was  the date  of the Bank of Japan's shown in  green.  The day before  we had conducted  a more modest intervention  operation on their behalf.intervention  operation  in Tokyo.  The Japanese  yen  is 6/30-7/1/983Many  market participants  have observed  an  apparent correlation between  the  dollar/yen  and various exchange  rates and rates  in other  asset about April  10,  many in the speculative  community  may have  reinforced  it through  their own  trading behavior in  the  expectation  of making  a profit.  That certainly  has happened.  But while  most market participants  are focused  on the weakening  yen  as the  cause of the recent  correlated movements,  I think we should not overlook the  common  thread of the strengthening  dollar and the strengthening  mark, which  I have not  graphed here,  as  capital  flees  the periphery  and moves  into core  industrial  countries.  In particular,  it seems  to me that over recent months,  the dollar and dollar  assets have  been  strengthening  as U.S.  economic  data have come in close to expectations,  though not  so strong as  to appear to require a policy tightening by the  Committee.  Indeed,  the data have been just weak enough to  avoid provoking  a tightening but not so weak  as to suggest that the end of the  great expansion might be  in sight.  While I do not have  similar charts for Germany,  the same phenomenon  has  been occurring there,  with the mark strengthening  against  the yen,  equity markets  reaching new highs,  and Bund yields  reaching  new lows.  The  Chairman's testimony  on June  10 before the Joint Economic Committee,  coming  as it did in the midst of much anxiety  about Japanese, Russian,  Chinese, South  African,  and other asset markets,  was  perceived by the  market as  something  of a neon sign  announcing  the good health  of the U.S.  economy  in contrast to much  of the rest  of the  world.  In addition, because  the Chairman  appears  to have  been read  in  the market  as being both on the  lookout for inflationary  pressures  but  also suggesting  that a near-term tightening was not  likely, investors took the testimony  as  a green light to buy Treasury  coupon  securities  with minimal  risk.  Our joint intervention  on June  17,  while providing  something of a respite from  the rush  of markets  in one direction,  also in  a sense  proved the correlation  hypothesis,  at  least to some people  in the  market.  In any  event, the  strengthening of the yen  provided  some trading  relief for many  other asset markets.  Overnight, we again had something  of the  same phenomenon.  Today,  official  statements in  Tokyo  that made a permanent income  tax cut  seem more likely  and suggested that one  faction of the LDP might  support the prime minister in his pursuit of a bridge bank concept gave the market  a certain  pause.  In  markets  here at the quarter-end,  a number of participants  seemed  to cash in their positions  and take their profits  home  when they could.  This  induced  something of a rally in the  yen, which played through into  other asset markets.  I'm afraid  that while there  is a positive side to  that, we should be aware of the likely risky  side,  namely that this episode  seems  once  again to be  confirming in  the market's  mind that everything  is driven  off the dollar/yen.6/30-7/1/98Turning  to the last page  and domestic open market  operations,  theaverage  effective  federal  funds rate since  your  last meeting has been quiteclose  to the  target rate  at 5.51  percent.  But as you can  see in the pattern  offunds rate trading over the three maintenance  periods, the daily  effectiverates  have  tended to oscillate between  slightly soft early  in the periods  andsomewhat firmer toward  the end of the periods.  You can  see the  slightdown/up,  down/up  pattern in the effective rates, the red horizontal  lines.This is not quite  how I think we should be going about meeting theCommittee's  objective of an average rate.  I would prefer to avoid theapparent instability  that stems  from having the market think of us as contentwith  the oscillation  of a negative  autocorrelation  pattern.  I would rather thatthey think of us and anticipate  our operations  as being directed  more towarda reversion to the mean.  I do not yet entirely understand why we have  hadthis problem of a  soft market  early in the maintenance  periods.  It maysimply be that  we have  switched back and  forth from adding to drainingreserves  as the needs worked out  that way.  It may also be that therecontinues  to be some  volatility in  the pattern  of major banks'  participation  inthe Treasury tax and loan  accounts.  Some  of them raise and then cut theircapacity,  and this is leading to some inherent  instability in  the market.In the last few  days,  markets have been  anticipating the usualpronounced  quarter-end  tightness in the market.  Today, federal  funds aretrading  above 6 percent  as we thought they would, but this is a majorpayment  day.  We have  tried to  address  the pressures.  You can see thesoftish tone we  gave the market  yesterday in our effort to anticipate  today'stightness.  We have  been  trying to meet that as best we can.Mr. Chairman,  I will need the Committee's  ratification of our domesticoperations.  Separately,  I will need ratification of our June  17  foreignexchange intervention  that I have previously described to the Committee.The System's  share comes to $416.7 million.  I would be  happy to answerany questions  members of the Committee  might have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Peter?  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I gather you are saying that you object to movements  up and downaround  the target  for the funds rate  and  you would like those  movements to be tighter.  Whyexactly  is that?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't want the market  to think that  if we allow  federal  funds to bevery soft at  the beginning  of the period,  we will inevitably let the market be tight at the end of6/30-7/1/98the period.  That is not my objective.  I'm afraid that the pattern  we have seen  tends to induce acertain  amount of instability  if market participants  come to anticipate  that if the fed funds  rate issoft, we will permit firmness  later.  I would prefer that they think of us,  whatever the funds ratedeviation  may be  on a particular day, as  trying to get  back to the target as best we can  on each ofthe subsequent days.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I don't have a question, Mr. Chairman,  but I would like tocomment about  some of the recent foreign  exchange market developments.  I will be brief.Specifically, I  see a risk in resisting the depreciation of the yen, if that begins to occur again.Obviously,  the countries in East Asia face an extraordinary,  challenging, and  difficult adjustmentproblem;  we  all know that.  There are  no good choices for them as I see it.  Deflationary  forcesin Japan have now pushed that very  important economy into recession.  Consequently, the yenhas depreciated  very sharply against the  dollar over the  last several  weeks.  The depreciation  mayindeed have  been disorderly enough that  it warranted  intervention.  I  do not know.  I certainlyrecognize that continued yen  depreciation  raises  a lot of problems  around the  world.  It raises  thethreat of another round of currency depreciation,  especially  in the East Asian  region.  But theperformance  of the Japanese  economy, as everybody  here knows,  is critical to the economichealth of that region  and to the health of the world economy generally.  And at this point, as I seeit, the  exchange  rate is one of the few  flexible prices that can  adjust quickly enough  andsubstantially  enough to help the Japanese  economy in the near term.I hope that as  we go forward we will  keep  in mind that  any international  effort to resistfurther yen depreciation  carries  some important risks of its own.  The reason  is that it haspotential  consequences  for both Japanese  and U.S. monetary policy.  Fundamentally, to prevent a6/30-7/1/98further yen depreciation  if underlying  economic  forces renew  downward  pressure  on thatcurrency, either the Bank of Japan  must pursue  a tighter  monetary policy or we  must pursue  amore accommodative  monetary  policy or some combination  of the two.  The former, of course,risks  an even deeper recession  in Japan.  The latter risks creating  stronger inflationary  pressuresin the U.S.  economy  at a  time when,  at  least in my view, rising inflation is already  a risk.  Theseobviously would be very  undesirable consequences in  two crucial  economies.  Indeed, a casecould be made that we really need just the opposite,  a more expansionary  monetary policy inJapan and a less  expansionary  one here.I do  not pretend, obviously,  to know  the best way  to address all of the  very difficultquestions  we face on this subject  as we go forward.  I suppose one could argue that thisCommittee  should be prepared to follow  a more accommodative  policy than it might otherwiseto facilitate  adjustment in East Asia.  Such  a policy would, of course, tend to stabilize  theexchange  rate.  But it is not obvious  to me  that the potential  benefits  from stabilizing  theyen/dollar rate, even  though there  clearly would be some  significant benefits at least in the  shortrun,  are worth risking the potentially  adverse  consequences  for both the U.S.  and Japaneseeconomies, given the underlying  monetary policy actions that might be required to maintain theyen/dollar rate  at or near its current  level  going  forward.  Again,  these  are the two largesteconomies  in the world and they are crucial  to the health  of the world economy.  It may be thatthe least-worst  choice in this situation is to let the yen depreciate further  and deal with the falloutfrom that  in Asia  and elsewhere  in the world  as best we  can.  On  a more positive note in thatcontext,  other Asian economies  clearly  would benefit over time from the stronger  Japaneseeconomy that an easier monetary policy in Japan  would foster, even  if the cost in the near termwere a weaker yen.  I just wanted to make those comments.  Hopefully,  they will be  helpful.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me just say that I do not think anyone  at theTreasury  would  seriously disagree  with the way  you framed the issue.  There  was a greatreluctance  at the Treasury  to intervene,  and the decision  was touch-and-go for a  considerableperiod of time.  I would say that the chances  of repeating such intervention  verge on the  remoteor even  less than that.  I believe there  is a real understanding that Japan's or moreeffort to stabilize the yen in April clearly  demonstrated  that intervention  per se does not work.  Ifwe ever needed any demonstration,  that was  it.  The only reason that intervention  seemed towork in the  latest episode  had nothing to do with the size of the intervention.  It was the result ofwhat somehow  was  perceived as a  signal that either  we were going to ease  monetary policy orthe Japanese  were going to tighten.  Clearly,  neither policy option  is even  remotely on the agendaat this  stage.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  While  our attention  has been  focused mostly on  Southeast  Asia, thesituation  in Russia is deteriorating  and seems to  be extremely vulnerable.  Could you or someonecomment on that?  Do we have  any relationship with Russia, formal  or informal, that would getus involved in  their problem?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I haven't even  heard the idea floated of an intervention  to support theruble, though it has been floated with  respect to  some of the other currencies  that have comeunder pressure  in the  last year.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  South Africa?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No.  We have operated  as agent for the  account of South Africa, butthat is a  standard reciprocity practice  among central banks.  We've done it routinely over the lastten  years  for the Reserve  Bank of Australia, so routinely that you never hear  about it.  It is ratherhard to turn down the Reserve Bank of South  Africa when they ask us to do  something that we6/30-7/1/98are doing  month in and  month out  for the Australian  authorities.  But for our own account or theTreasury's  account,  I haven't heard any proposal  floated for intervention  in  support of the ruble.I'm not  sure how I would  go about trading that currency.  But your question  was a little moregeneral,  and I defer  to Ted Truman  or others  on whether there  are other modes of assistance wemight be giving to the Russians.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  The complications  with Russia stem from the fact that it is importantto the United States  politically  and less important economically  and  financially.  It is much  moreimportant economically  and financially to our European  colleagues.  The basic problem inRussia is that  although they have  made better progress than I think many people  might haveexpected  six or seven  years ago, they also have  a much longer way to go.  In particular,  thecapacity of the country to generate revenues  and the need for funds to meet the obligations  of thegovernment have not been  matched.  There is a real concern  that the heavy  involvement ofexternal  funds  in the financing of their government budget in recent  years is building  up amountain  of debt that may be  a problem.  But the crucial  issue here is the  capacity of the politicalsystem in Russia to operate effectively.As far as financing is concerned,  even  leaving  aside the operations  that Peter Fishercommented  on, I do not have a sense that there  is a strong  likelihood of any bilateral  financing,though I wouldn't  assign zero probability to anything at this point.  The more likely mechanismswould involve  the continued use of international  financial  institutions  where, perhaps  especiallyin the Russian  case,  the multilateral  approach  through  these institutions  is probably helpful interms of blunting  some of the political criticisms.The other comment  I would make, which  is a tribute to what has been accomplished  inpart through the efforts of the Federal Reserve System over the years,  is that I perceive  a general6/30-7/1/98feeling now that the central  bank is one  of the strongest  institutions in  Russia.  It  should be notedthat many features  of the Federal Reserve  System were built into the Central  Bank of Russia.But as we know,  central banks cannot  do it all  by themselves.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The major concern  in the Russian  situation is that thetime is rapidly approaching  when a major crisis could occur.  As you probably know,  the Russianauthorities have  found it increasingly  difficult to refinance  maturing obligations  in  their newTreasury bill  market.  As their outstanding  bills have matured,  the Russians  have increasinglyhad to raise  interest rates  in order to sell the new bills, and there  apparently  is no equilibrium  ratelevel.  A lot of those bills denominated  in  rubles are held by foreigners.  At this stage,  the timeframe before  the crunch  occurs  is probably only a few  weeks  to  a month  or so.The issue that Ted Truman  alluded to is a very considerable  concern  in thisgovernment beyond the  financial  officials--people  in the White House, the  State Department,  andthe security  agencies--that  some  action will have to be taken to prevent  the collapse of theRussian  economic system.  The question that is  driving everyone to the wall is what type ofconditionality  can  be imposed.  As Ted has  mentioned and  his colleagues  have  reaffirmed in  afairly explicit  manner, the  Russians have  a  tax structure  at the  moment that if it were fullyenforced  and fully complied  with, would make everyone  bankrupt.  As  a consequence,  peopleare given  the choice of paying their taxes legally and going bankrupt or not paying them at all.  Itis very difficult to  be somewhere in  the middle.  The new  Russian government  is trying to put atax reform  bill through  the Duma to get a much  lower tax structure  that is capable of beingcomplied  with  and will therefore raise  revenues.  At the moment,  their revenue  shortfall  is verylarge, and they  are continuously required to fund it.  Their need for revenues  will  inevitably  go tothe central  bank as their ultimate  and only source  of funding.  At that point the ruble will be6/30-7/1/98gone.  Its value will essentially  disappear.  Some  estimates  are that it will decline by 50 percent.The  geopolitical implications  are  very obvious.  At the moment, it looks as though  pressure isbuilding  to get the IMF to do  something.  It is not clear what will happen  if that approach doesnot work  or conditionality  does not work.  All  I can say is that there is considerable  anxietyamong  political authorities  in  this country about a potential  collapse of the ruble in Russia.  I donot know  what  the outcome will be.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  The Russians  are  aggravating the problemfurther in their handling  of their short-term workout,  if there is one, by doing  some borrowing  indollars and  other hard currencies  and pledging  export earnings  as collateral.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  gives them  a day or two!  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  I want to return  to Japan  briefly.  I had a question for Peter Fisheron the recent  intervention.  Can  you tell us how market participants  viewed this intervention andalso what they  see as  the  outlook for possible  future interventions?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  The  intervention  in which  we participated  on June  17 certainly tookthe market  by surprise.  We had a much  bigger price  effect than  I and, I think, a number of mycolleagues  anticipated.  Some large speculative  players seemed to have  been extending theirlong-dollar/short-yen  positions, and  as the  yen strengthened from  146,  where we entered thelosses on a mark-to-market  basis  and some of them close their positions,  that gets the market'sattention.  I think the rate went to  142 much  faster than most market participants  thought itwould.  They expected it to  take longer.  It is  worth noting  that the rate  has not yet returned  to theprevious high  of 146.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Didn't it strengthen  to  143?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  It peaked this time in  the high  142's, briefly touching  143.  It is clearthat the market  is going to be on guard for further  intervention.  I would be the first to say thatintervention  without some message  is not going to be very effective,  as our  South African friendsfound when they orchestrated  their own intervention.  The Bank of England joined with  us intrying to  warn them that trying to match the speculators  dollar-for-dollar  without some newmessage  about what  was going  on probably would not have much  effect.  In fact,  it wascounterproductive.  That kind of intervention  creates the liquidity illusion that speculators  canturn over their positions  and  get cheap  dollars.I should add  that in terms  of market expectations,  the  financial  world was  coming toan end as  of just a week  ago, and the Japanese  were going to be completely  incapacitated  in theview of most foreign exchange  traders.  Clearly,  the Japanese  have  been  able  to beat those  lowexpectations!  I  alluded to some  announcements  and some  comments  that they made aboutpermanent  income tax cuts.  So, the Japanese  are beating the expectation  that they would donothing.  That, I think, has helped to moderate the yen's movement  over  the last few  days  andhas prevented  it from  going back up to  146.  But much remains  to be seen between  now and theother side of the Japanese  elections.  I don't have  the sense that the market is anticipating anyimminent intervention.  I think market participants  are  very curious  about  further announcementsout of Tokyo.  I hope that  answers  your question.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Yes, thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  On the Japanese  situation again,  we received  what  I thought was  afascinating paper on the policy options available to the Japanese.  It certainly emphasized  the fact6/30-7/1/98that they need to do something that is fairly aggressive  and strong  on the  fiscal side.  The  paperalso discussed the topic that Al Broaddus  brought up, namely,  the potential  for a depreciatingyen to lead over some period of time to a recovery  through  an expansion  in exports.  In thatregard, I was wondering  whether the yen  has actually depreciated  on a trade-weighted  basis.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It depends on which  trade-weighted basis one  uses.  It is a fact thatthe yen has not depreciated as much on  a broad trade-weighted basis--it  has depreciated  slightlyon that basis--as it obviously has  against the dollar.  In fact, that is part of the argument.  Buthaving said that, as Peter Fisher pointed out in his reference  to correlations,  the problem is that tothe extent that the yen weakens  further and the won, the rupiah, and the Thai  baht all weakenwith  it, it does not weaken relatively  that much on a trade-weighted basis,  but it does weakenrelative to dollar.  This is implicit in  Peter Fisher's comments,  and I would agree with that.  Insome  sense,  we have  the chicken  and the egg conundrum,  but it is increasingly clear that  Japan isthe heavy  occupant of the boat, if I  may mix my metaphors.  So,  a lot depends  on the health  ofthe Japanese  economy, as President Broaddus  pointed out.It also  isn't clear on the other  side that even  if the yen depreciates,  it is likely toprovide much net stimulus  to the Japanese  economy.  This is partly because it will not depreciatethat much  on average,  and  it's not clear that the associated  income effects  among Japan's  tradingpartners in Asia will not overwhelm  any yen price  advantages relative to the dollar.  I would notadvocate  a policy of letting the yen  go, nor do  I think the recent  intervention  was intended  topromote any  stabilization of the  yen.  Its purpose was  at best to  try to cause the markets  to pauseand think a little about what the fundamentals  might be  saying.  There is some  question, it seemsto me, on that  score.  But the simple  answer to your question is that the yen  may be said to beback  to where it was,  but it depends  a bit on what you take as your reference point or index.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Thank you very much.  We willnow go to the staff report to be  presented  by Messrs.  Prell, Stockton,  and Hooper.  Gentlemen.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We will be using the set of charts  titled "StaffPresentation on the Economic  Outlook."2/  But before I turn to the  firstexhibit, I want to take  a minute to update  you on the implications  of thelate-breaking  data--particularly  Friday's report on personal  consumption.As  you know, the downward  revisions to  spending in March  and April,along with  a mild downside surprise  with respect to the May increase, left uson a path that makes  it unlikely we will  see the  5+ percent growth  of realPCE that was predicted  in the Greenbook.  If we were  starting afresh today,we would  write down  something in the  low 4 percent range.Some of the surprise  in these data appears  to have reflected a differentsplit of auto sales between  consumption  and  producers'  durables,  whichdoes  not affect GDP.  But that  is only part of the  shortfall,  and we wouldnow trim our forecast for second-quarter  GDP growth to about  1-1/2  percent.Seemingly,  some of what  the GDP gods  unexpectedly  gave us in the firstquarter they may have taken  away in the second--still  leaving us, though,with  a quite impressive  overall first-half performance  for GDP.2/  Copies  of the charts  are  appended to  the transcript.  (Appendix  2)6/30-7/1/98Perhaps there  was a more  graceful  way to start our presentation  thanwith a correction of the Greenbook  forecast, but at this  point we do not seethis news as undermining  the major themes in the outlook that we will beaddressing.  So, let me  turn now to the first chart, which provides  a briefsummary  of our projections.In the top panels,  you can see that  we are forecasting  a marked  slowingof the economic  expansion.  The thin red line  shows the quarter-to-quartermovements  in real GDP, while the black  line captures  the broader contoursvia a four-quarter percent  change.  We believe  that growth  will remain  lowover the next six quarters--indeed,  considerably below the trend growth ofpotential output, which we put at almost 2-3/4  percent over this period.Under these circumstances,  we expect to see unemployment  driftupward, as indicated in the middle panels.  By the end of this year, thejobless rate  approaches  4-1/2  percent  and by the end of 1999, 5 percent.Even  with this rise,  labor markets will still be tight, putting pressure  onreal  wages and on prices  as  well.  We  see the CPI rising  only  1-3/4 percentthis year but picking up to 2-1/4  percent next year.  In the chart, we have alsoshown the time series adjusted for technical  changes to the index since 1994,the red line,  so that  you can  get a sense  of the "true" degree of decelerationand acceleration  over  time.Chart 2 addresses  some facets  of the  financial  backdrop for thisprojection.  We have once  again  predicated our forecast  on the  assumptionthat there will be no significant  shift in  the federal funds rate through  nextyear.  Although we anticipate  that nominal  bond yields  eventually will backup a bit, as you can  see in the top panel, there  are no really  excitingmovements  in real rates  in the  forecast.  Given  that the economy has beenchugging  along in the face  of the current  monetary  policy setting--at least upto the current quarter--this  might naturally lead one to ask what we  think isgoing to produce  the  sustained weakening  of aggregate  demand growth wehave predicted.From the financial  side, one  answer is merely that we do not have  arepetition  of the decline in longer-term rates that has provided a boost toeconomic  growth  over the past year.  But another answer can be found inour stock market forecast.  We are anticipating  a decline of just six percentin share prices,  occurring over the next  several  months.  As  the middle panelshows,  we  estimate that this would roughly flatten out the price-earningsmultiple on the S&P  500.  I won't take up your time with the umpteenthrestatement of our skepticism regarding the sustainability  of these  valuationlevels.  The panel  points  up just one  extraordinary  aspect  of the market'sperformance--which  is that the P/E is not only at an historic high, but that, in6/30-7/1/98contradiction  of past patterns,  it has reached that  level well  past the troughof the earnings  cycle.Indeed, it is  our sense  that the current market level reflects,  in part,unrealistic  expectations  about future  profitability.  The  lower  left panelshows  the divergence  between Wall  Street strategists'  predictions  forearnings  and our own.  One might argue  that this difference is the stuff of agreater market  correction, but the ability of the market  to continue  itslevitation act thus far this year makes us reluctant to go much further thanwe have.  In  any event, the end of the stock market  uptrend will itselfremove another source of impetus  to demand.Finally, in  fixed-income markets, we expect  that, if and  as theeconomy shows  signs of persistently  slower growth  and weaker profits,lenders  and bond investors will turn a bit more cautious.  As you can  see  atthe right, there has been only a slight widening  of risk premiums in  the bondbond issues  rather than a fundamental  shift in investor attitudes.  We expectspreads to remain  relatively modest, but again, we see things  moving in aless  stimulative direction than they have over the  past couple  of years.Of obvious importance  for financial market sentiment  and for demandtrends in the economy is  the denouement  of the drama playing  out overseas.And so,  we turn now to Peter Hooper for his  assessment of the  outlook inthat regard.

MR. HOOPER.  Developments in  international financial markets,which are reviewed in Chart 3,  continue to be dominated by turbulence  inAsia as Peter Fisher has indicated.  Movements  of exchange rates in thatregion,  shown  at the  top left,  can be  divided into three groups of currencies:first, sharp  declines  in the dollar  values of Korean  and  Southeast Asiancurrencies  last fall,  followed by  some recovery  and a further downturn morerecently;  second, a  somewhat  less pronounced but persistent decline  in theyen;  and third, still  relatively stable  currencies  in Greater China andSingapore.  Movements  in  Asian equity markets have  paralleled those incurrency  markets  across these groups,  with equity prices  in Southeast Asiaand Korea turning down  again  in recent  months  after an early  1998  bounce-back, while those in  Japan  and China plus Singapore  have  shown  much lessprecipitous  declines  since mid-1997.Looking  ahead,  a central  assumption  underlying our forecast  is that inthe period ahead Japanese  authorities  will come to terms on and implementan effective resolution of their banking  crisis.  Bumps in the road will beinevitable;  interruptions of credit  lines and other uncertainties  associatedwith the resolution process will weigh  on real  activity for much  of theforecast  period, but we  expect  financial  markets eventually to be bolstered6/30-7/1/98by signs of progress.  Against  that background, we  have  assumed that theyen will  be flat for the balance  of 1998  and will appreciate  somewhat  during1999.  Our forecast  has currencies  elsewhere  in Asia remaining  aboutunchanged  in nominal  terms, with the exception of the Chinese  renminbi,which we  see  depreciating moderately  next  year.  The currencies  of Koreaand  Southeast Asia should appreciate  in real terms  with rising inflation inthose countries.The middle two  panels show  developments  in  other key emergingdwarfed by its earlier recovery from crisis-induced lows  several yearsago--the  real peso is still nearly 20 percent below  the pre-crisis  highsreached in early  1994.  Brazilian authorities  have maintained  a steady rate ofdepreciation in the real, and we assume they will be  able to continue to doso.  Russian  authorities,  too, have  so far succeeded  in  keeping the rublerelatively  stable in the  face of growing  uncertainties  about Russia'seconomic  prospects, but the odds  of a sharp depreciation  are  rising.  (Russiahas too small  a weight in U.S.  trade to be included  in  our index for thedollar.)  Stock markets in all three countries  have retreated noticeably fromearlier highs  in the past year, feeling the contagion  from Asian equityAmong the major industrial currencies,  shown  in the bottom panels,sterling  has strengthened  recently,  while  the Canadian  dollar has weakenedagainst the dollar and the mark has moved roughly sideways  since its sharpappreciate  somewhat over the  year ahead as the new monetary  union gainsindustrial  and emerging  market economies  follows  a similar pattern.  Stockmonths,  while those in  the United Kingdom  and  Canada have leveled off orTurning to foreign  economic  activity, while observers  on continentalU.S.  shores are  still waiting for the tsunami to hit, our seismographs  nowindicate,  for a second time, that the quake  in Asia has been  substantiallylarger than previously believed.  The top left panel  of Chart 4 shows how  weviewed total foreign  GDP growth  and Asian  real GDP growth prospects  lastelsewhere  in  Southeast  Asia.  At the  time,  we saw  economic  and financialturbulence  as  a downside  risk for Asia, but with indicators for the thirdquarter  coming in strong for the region  as  a whole, this risk did notsignificantly  alter our baseline  forecast  for growth  to remain  near itshistorical trend rate  of more than 5  percent.  By the time of the JanuaryGreenbook, the panel  at the top right of this chart, with the crisis  having6/30-7/1/98intensified greatly and spread to north Asia, we had marked down  Asia'sgrowth for  1998  by more than  4 percentage  points to less than  1 percent.In recent  weeks,  news about  the first quarter and preliminaryindications  for the second quarter have been  far weaker than  we anticipated,indicating that GDP has been  plunging  at unprecedented rates,  as  shown inthe lower left panel.  Our current forecast has  Asia's GDP falling  3 percentduring  1998  and picking up only very  sluggishly, by Asian standards  atleast, in  1999.  The  level  of GDP in that region  at the end of the forecastperiod is  11  percent  below the path we  were projecting last  September.  Wesee  total foreign  growth,  the black bars, rising over the  next year  and a halfas the drag from Asia recedes.The lower right panel  shows the  importance  of various regions  in U.S.exports--the weights  used in constructing  our foreign  GDP aggregate--aswell as their shares  in total foreign  GDP.  Asia accounts  for over 40 percentof foreign  GDP but for 30 percent  of U.S. exports  and on that basis isdivided into three roughly equal subgroups:  (1) the front-line  crisiseconomies of Korea and Southeast Asia,  (2) Japan  (which seems  to beseeking membership in  the first group),  and (3)  Greater China plusSingapore.  Europe,  Canada, and Latin  America,  shown at the bottom, eachtake about  one-fifth,  or a little more,  of U.S. exports.Turning to a closer look at these regions,  your next chart focuses on thefront-line Asian economies.  The numbers here  are mind-boggling but, Iwould caution,  also very fragile  and subject to substantial  revision.  In  thefirst quarter  of 1998, real  GDP in Korea, Indonesia,  and Malaysia  dropped atannual rates  in excess  of 20 percent.  Early indicators  for many of thesecountries suggest large declines  in the second quarter as well.  The picturethat emerges  from our analysis of this free  fall in GDP, based on some stillvery sketchy details  and an  accumulation  of anecdotal  reports,  is indicatedin the  middle panel.  Sharp contractions  in consumption  and especially  ininvestment have resulted from four factors:  first, massive  adjustments  ofbalance  sheets as  private wealth  has plunged with the downturn  in stockvalue of foreign  debt;  second,  growing  uncertainty  about job security  andearnings prospects  as unemployment  and business failures  have  soared;third, cancellation of construction  and investment projects  following pastoverinvestment  and growing  excess capacity;  and fourth, a widespreadcredit crunch  and rising cost of funds.  Credit availability has dried up asforeign  investors have  fled and as domestic banking systems  haveretrenched.  Substantial  increases in interest rates--as  indicated  at the  lowerleft--have  raised  the cost of funds,  although real rates  have risen much lessas inflation has ratcheted  up in most of these  countries  and soared  inIndonesia in response to currency  depreciations.6/30-7/1/98As indicated  in the  lower right panel, trade balances  in  these countrieshave dropped sharply, primarily  because  imports have plummeted with  thecontraction of domestic  demand.  Korea's  imports in the first quarter were$53  billion at  an annual  rate, or nearly 40 percent  below  year-earlier levels,contributing to most of the $63  billion increase  in its trade balance over thesame period.  In most cases, exports  have failed to  rise appreciably, partlybecause  of the  contraction of trade credit  but also  because  of falling exportprices  and the  fact that a large  share of the exports of these countries  are toeach other.Returning to the top panel, in the two right-hand  columns we areprojecting further significant  declines in  activity in the  second half of 1998and only  sluggish recovery  at best next  year.  The near-term  outlook forIndonesia is especially  bleak, weighed down  by ongoing politicaluncertainty,  social unrest, and a paralyzed banking  system.  The likelyprolonged  absences of many ethnic  Chinese,  constituting a substantialportion  of Indonesia's entrepreneurial  and managerial  expertise,  also areresulting in critical  breakdowns  in the distribution  system.  Prospects  in theother countries  are  somewhat less gloomy as  some progress  has  been madeon restructuring  foreign  debt.  Current accounts in many cases have movedstrongly  into surplus,  and macroeconomic  stabilization  programs  are beingadhered to.  Once  domestic  financial conditions  begin to stabilize, renewedaccess to international  capital  markets should  help to support economicexpansion, but probably not until  later next year.A linchpin for the prospects  of stabilizing Asia's financial  markets isJapan, the  subject of Chart 6.  As  can be seen  in the first line of the upperpanel,  GDP fell  at a 5 percent  annual  rate  in the  first quarter,  much morethan expected.  Consumption  was weak, reflecting  declining  consumersentiment and rising unemployment,  as shown  in the  middle  left panel.Sentiment  fell further in April,  while unemployment  soared in April  andleveled off in  May, although  the ratio of job offers  to applicants weakenedfurther in May to a 20-year low.  These  and other recent developmentsportend a significant  further downturn  in consumption in the  second quarter.Investment  dropped  sharply in the first quarter and likely declined further inthe  second quarter.  As shown  in the middle right panel,  the Tankan  surveyof business  sentiment  and the lending attitudes of Japanese  banks tanked inthe first half of the year.  The drop in the latter series is evidence  of a creditcrunch  associated with the  growing crisis in Japan's banking system.Uncertainties  surrounding  the resolution of the banking  crisis, as  banks areclosed, merged,  or otherwise  dealt with  will continue  to depressconsumption  and particularly  investment in the  second half of 1998,  but weare assuming that private  domestic demand  will stabilize and begin to creepup next year as  longer-term prospects  for the  financial  system  begin tobrighten.  The projected increase in GDP in the  second half of this year ismore than  accounted  for by fiscal expansion  as the  recently passed  large6/30-7/1/98supplemental  budget package more  than offsets the contraction  incorporatedin Japan's initial  1998 budget.  As indicated in the lower left, we are nowassuming that the structural  budget deficit will weaken  by 3/4 percent of GDPthis  year and a  bit less  next year.  We also expect  net exports  to make  amodest  positive contribution  to GDP growth,  as indicated at the  lower right,with real imports contracting  somewhat  further and exports receiving somestimulus from the depreciation  of the yen.Turning to the third group of Asian  economies,  Greater China andSingapore,  growth in China has slowed noticeably  from the near double-digit pace  of a year ago,  as  both exports  and direct foreign  investmentinflows have  declined sharply.  We  are projecting  growth to come in wellbelow the  government's  target of 8  percent during  1998  and to recoversomewhat in  1999.  We  assume, though with  diminishing conviction,  thatthe Hong  Kong peg will hold despite the beating  that the Hong Kongeconomy  has  been  taking.  Hong Kong's  GDP fell  at a 10  percent  annualrate  in the first quarter following a downward revised fourth quarter.  Thespike in interest rates  late last year, shown in the middle  left panel, inresponse  to pressures  on the Hong Kong dollar along  with massivecorrections  in equity  and property values  have weighed  heavily  on  domesticdemand  and will continue to do  so well into  next year.The bottom two panels  summarize  changes  in the combined externalbalance  of all  ten major Asian economies.  As  shown  on the left,  we  expectthe  combined current account  surplus  of this region  to be well over $200billion this year, up from  less  than $50 billion  in  1996.  A  rough indicationof how this massive shift is being distributed around the  globe is  shown  atthe right, based on trade data for eight of the ten  economies.  Between  thefirst quarter of 1997  and the first quarter of 1998,  the combined tradesurplus  increased $151  billion.  Of this total,  $36 billion  was in trade withthe United  States  and $41  billion with Europe.  In  both cases, Asia's importsfell and exports rose  by similar amounts.  The  $50 billion  decline  in Asia'simports from itself, and hence identical  decline  in its exports  to itself,reflects  a sharp contraction  in intra-Asian  trade  as demand  in the region  hasplummeted.  There  was also  a sharp  drop  in imports from the  "other" region,largely OPEC  and Latin  America, reflecting  in part declines  in the  volumeand price of oil imports.Your next chart touches  on the rest  of the world.  Despite the  negativesurprise  in  Asia, growth  in Europe  came in at a healthy  3  percent  annual ratein the first quarter.  As indicated  in the second panel on  the lower left,  netexports  made a large  negative  contribution  to Europe's  GDP growth  in thefirst quarter,  partly because  of a  surge in imports  and partly because of aslowing of exports to Asia.  In contrast, Canadian  net exports benefited  fromstrong demand  in the United  States.  The net export  drag in continentalEurope  was offset by robust  growth in domestic  demand,  supported by low6/30-7/1/98or declining  interest rates,  shown  at the right.  U.K. interest  rates  have beenrising, however, as  the  unemployment  rate, shown  in the third panel on thelower left, has declined  further, and consumer price inflation,  shown  at theright, has moved  above the  Bank of England's  2.5  percent target range.Looking  ahead, we project growth in Euroland  to continue at a fairly robustpace, buoyed in part by  "europhoria,"  while  growth in the  United Kingdomand Canada  should slow  somewhat.The bottom two panels  address developments  in  Latin America.Negative  effects  of the Asian crisis  have been  felt by the major countries  inthis region.  Brazil's GDP  will be  depressed this year, partly by a run-up ininterest rates  in the wake  of the Asian turmoil last fall.  Brazil's problemsare also home grown,  including persistently large fiscal  and external  deficitsand growing political  uncertainty  as President  Cardoso faces  a toughchallenge from labor candidate Lula ahead of the elections in October.Mexico has been  hurt by the  drop in oil  prices, and the region as  a whole  isfacing higher spreads  in international  credit markets.  Assuming thesituation  in Asia stabilizes  by next year, we  expect  growth to pick up inMexico and Argentina.  However,  this means a  further widening  of theregion's  current account deficit,  shown  at the  right.  In the  case of Mexico,we can begin to anticipate  its own special  Year 2000 problem  in connectionwith its 6-year presidential  election  cycle.Chart 9 reviews the implications of these  developments for U.S.exports  and imports.  Recent movements  in  U.S. exports  by region reflectthe differing  trends  in activity abroad.  Exports  to Europe and Canada havebeen on  an uptrend, while shipments to  Asia dropped  sharply in the firstquarter.  Imports, shown  at the right, rose in the first quarter from all regionsexcept Asia.  However, there  appears to  be some uncaptured  seasonalvariance  in these data; imports from Asia  were well above  their level of fourquarters earlier, roughly  consistent with the view  we get from Asia's exportdata.As shown  in  the middle  left panel,  real net exports  of goods  andservices  declined  in the  first quarter  and, given  the substantial  drop thatoccurred in April,  we expect  a more  significant decline in the secondquarter.  Thereafter,  a slight increase  is projected for the second half of  1998and a somewhat faster expansion  in  1999, roughly in line with the projectedpickup in total  foreign GDP growth.  Real import growth,  shown in themiddle right panel,  should slow  in the second quarter  and beyond inresponse to the decline in U.S.  GDP  growth.  The  bottom line for real netexports,  as shown  in  the lower left panel, is another  substantial negativecontribution to GDP growth in the  second quarter, about  1-1/2  percentagepoints, followed  by lesser negatives  in the second  half and next year.  Theongoing declines  in net exports push the current account,  shown at the right,below minus  3-1/2  percent of GDP by the end  of 1999.  This level  matches  the6/30-7/1/98previous  low that occurred in  1987,  a period of considerable  weakness  in thedollar.

MR. PRELL.  I think the domestic  demand picture is  sufficientlyfamiliar to you that I can  run  through the highlights quite  quickly.  We areexpecting  a substantial  deceleration  of both household and businessspending.  Chart 10 summarizes  the  household  side.  The Greenbookpredicted a quite noticeable  drop-off in the  growth of consumer spending  inthe wake of the first-quarter surge,  and the latest  data suggest that thatslowing has come a bit faster than the previous  figures had indicated.  But,even  4+ percent in the  second quarter is a pretty hefty further  gain, and thefundamentals  at this point  are still highly favorable to demand.  So, wewould be  inclined to  stick with the general contour of the forecastrepresented by the  heavy black  line in the upper left panel, which  shows thefour-quarter  change in PCE dropping off from over 4 percent at this point tosomething closer to 2-1/2  percent in  1999.  One indication of the favorablefundamentals  is the still high reading  on consumer  sentiment  in the JuneMichigan survey, portrayed at the right.  For many households,  I suspectthat the rising value of their stock portfolios has been  a  significant  source oftheir confidence  and willingness to spend.  The middle left panel  documentsthe remarkable run-up  in the ratio of wealth  to income,  the black  line.Historically, the personal  saving rate has tended  to move  inversely with thewealth  ratio, and the current episode is no  exception.  The anticipatednext year and a half and--allowing  for lags--this contributes  to a leveling  outof the saving rate, thereby explaining the moderation of spending growth.In the housing market, all  signals on demand are  still flashing green.Yesterday,  the  Census figures  showed new home sales  edging up to  a newhigh  in May,  and--as plotted at the right--the  homebuilders'  survey for earlyahead,  a modest updrift  in mortgage rates in  combination  with a slowing inemployment  and income  gains will take some of the "oomph"  out of themeasured by the cash-flow  burden of ownership will  remain very  favorable.Thus, we  are projecting  a decline  in housing starts  that leaves  the level  stillcomparable to the  high readings  of the past few  years.Turning to the next chart, which relates  to business spending,  the upperleft panel highlights  one  of the most important  elements in  the dynamics ofour forecast.  Over the  past year,  a  significant component  of the growth  ofGDP has been the rise in the  pace of inventory  accumulation--the  black  line.Stocks  have been rising  much  faster than the trend of final  sales--the redline.  This is not a  sustainable  pattern, and  we think  we see signs  in the Aprildata that a drop-off in stocking  may be  in the cards.  We still  have  a sizableaccumulation  of non-auto stocks  in the  current quarter, however,  and  so we6/30-7/1/98expect that a further slowing of inventory  growth will  be putting aconsiderable  damper on  demand  over the second half of the year.As the expansion  of demand is perceived to be  slowing,  businesses willlikely be  less anxious  to invest in plant and equipment as  well.  The  blackline in  the right panel shows that we  are projecting that  real BFI  growth willslow  from about 12 percent  over the past year to half that pace in 1999.Because the level  of investment will  still be  rising, though,  we estimate  thatthis forecast implies that capital  stock growth,  the middle  left panel, willremain  substantial--exceeding  the pace of output expansion.Although we believe that  declining capacity  utilization will be causingdiscomfort  in some  sectors--especially  in  manufacturing--there  are  somebasic considerations  favoring  a rise in the desired capital-output  ratio.  Anobvious  one is portrayed  at the right:  the declining  relative cost ofequipment, particularly  computers and communications  equipment.  It iswith the expectation  that the prices  of such information technology  willcontinue  to decline rapidly that we  are predicting that  investment in capitalequipment will  continue growing  at a good clip through  next year.As  you can  see at the lower left, the data on new orders booked bydomestic manufacturers  of nondefense  capital  goods are already providing  apossible hint of the projected  pattern of investment, with orders forcomputers and communications  equipment having risen  appreciably, even  innominal terms, this year, while orders for other equipment have  leveled out.I should note, however, that it is tricky to translate  these  data into GDPexpenditures,  given that  international trade is  so important in this sector.Finally, we are  predicting that the  structures  component of BFI will berising modestly  over the coming quarters.  As  suggested by the vacancyrates  at the right, trends  and conditions  differ across the various markets, butit is our sense that there are enough  areas of strength to push aggregateconstruction  somewhat higher.  The recent  upturn  in the monthly data  onconstruction  was  heartening  in this regard;  but, frankly, we are not yet surewhether the  latest data are reflecting  an actual  change or simply the firststage of a statistical improvement  that will be followed up subsequently  bysignificant  upward revisions to the historical time  series.But, before I lapse into further discussion  of  statistical  arcana, let meturn the  floor over to Dave Stockton  for a more important  subject--theoutlook for  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  The upper panel of your next exhibit lays  out thekey  components  of the supply  side of our projection.  We use  a variety  ofapproaches  for estimating potential output.  The one displayed here is  agrowth  accounting  framework.  As  may be  seen  on line  1, we are  projecting6/30-7/1/98that growth of potential  output, on  a consistently measured basis, will be  2-1/2percent per year during the  1995  to  1999 period.  This translates into a 2-3/4percent increase by  1999  after allowing for the technical  changes in the CPI.The growth of potential output is more than 1/2 percentage  point higher thanthe pace estimated to have prevaied  over the first half of the  1990s.  Laborinput--line 2--is projected to increase  at a  1 percent annual rate, close  to theaverage  pace observed earlier this  decade.  But we  now estimate  that trendgrowth  in labor productivity--line  3--has  picked up to a  1-1/2 percent  pace peryear.  As  you know,  we revised up this estimate  by about 1/4 percentage  pointin the May Greenbook,  and we expect  that this  faster pace  will  continueover the forecast  period.The two principal  elements behind this pickup in trend productivity  arecapital  deepening  and  multifactor productivity.  As Mike  noted earlier, thehigh level of business investment  has boosted the  growth of the capitalstock, and with it capital services.  As  shown on line 4, we estimate that theaccompanying  step-up in capital  deepening  has contributed a bit more than1/2  percentage  point to  the acceleration  of trend labor productivity.Multifactor productivity--line  6--which  captures  the efficiency with whichcapital and labor inputs  are utilized, is projected to be on an upward trend ofabout  1/3 percentage  point per year, well  above the average  pace of thepreceding  15  years.As  we see it, there are risks on both sides  of our projection of trendproductivity.  On the downside, productivity  is a sensitive cyclical  variableand extracting the  trend from  the cycle  in the  midst of a strong  upswing  inactivity is exceedingly  difficult.  It's possible that the recent improvement inlabor productivity  will  prove less durable when  output  slows than we arecurrently assuming.  On  the upside,  multifactor  productivity in the pastcouple of years grew  faster than the  1/3  percentage  point per annum that wehave pencilled  in as  the trend.  Moreover, the explosion of investment,especially in the  high-tech area,  suggests that businesses are anticipatingample rates of return that would be consistent  with some greater increase  inthe marginal  efficiency  of investment.As  you can see from the dashed extension of the black line in  themiddle panel, we are  projecting that actual labor productivity  will  grow  a bitmore  slowly than trend, on average,  over the next  six quarters.  In part, weanticipate that productivity  will  exhibit a fairly typical slowing whenactivity  decelerates  as, for a time, employers continue  to fill outstandingvacancies.  We also have incorporated  a minor dent in productivitygrowth--on  the order  of a tenth  or two in  1998  and  1999--for the  diversionof resources to  addressing the Year 2000 problem.With regard  to labor input,  the abundance  of job opportunities in thistight market  has lifted  the labor force  participation  rate--the lower  left6/30-7/1/98panel--to  a level  above our estimated trend.  Going forward,  we anticipatethat, with jobs  remaining  readily available  and real wages  rising, theparticipation  rate will hold roughly constant  at 67.1  percent.The flat participation  rate implies  that the growth  of the labor force--thefirst column in the lower  right panel--should mirror the roughly  onepercentage  point per year expansion  in the  working age population.Employment  growth--the  second column--is projected to slow considerably,in lagged response  to the downshift in activity.  To place this in someperspective,  we  are looking for payroll  employment to slow from averageincreases of more than 250,000 per month over the  past year to about100,000 per month next year.Turning  to the upper left panel of Chart  13, with  the growth ofemployment  dropping below  that of the  labor force, the unemployment  rateis projected to rise gradually  to a shade  below  5 percent,  relieving only someof the pressure  on what is a very tight market.  Anecdotal  reports continue tostress  the difficulties  that  many employers are experiencing  in finding andretaining workers--difficulties  that are especially  acute in hot fields such asinformation  technology.  These  perceptions  appear to be shared  byhouseholds.  As  shown in the upper right panel, the proportion ofrespondents  to the June  Conference  Board survey viewing jobs  as plentifuloutstripped those reporting jobs as hard to get by a wide margin, in adramatic  reversal of the situation that existed earlier this decade.The influence  of taut markets on labor compensation  is likely to bereinforced  over the next year and a  half by continued acceleration  of healthinsurance costs.  A recent Peat Marwick  survey of large firms found thathealth insurance  premiums are expected  to rise about 3-1/4 percent  this year--astill modest increase but one that is, nonetheless, the highest in  four years.We are anticipating  an extension of this uptrend next year--consistent  withthe reports  of outsized  increases that  are  scheduled to take effect  or that areunder negotiation.That  said, not all of the influences  on labor compensation  are  likely tobe  in the upward direction.  We are not anticipating  a repeat of theminimum wage increases  of the past  two years.  Moreover,  as we noted inthe Greenbook,  bonuses,  commissions,  and other forms of flexiblecompensation  that  are tied to business performance  should  level out or turndown next year, as activity slows and profits edge  lower.  More  broadly,most measures  of inflation  expectations  have moved down  over the pastyear.  The Michigan SRC  results--plotted in the middle right--have  movedup a bit recently but on net are  still below  the readings  of the past few years.Low past and prospective  inflation  should be  a source  of restraint  on wagedetermination  over the  next year.6/30-7/1/98On balance,  the growth of ECI compensation  per hour--shown by thered line  in the lower  left panel--is  projected to be  about flat this year andnext, near its  recent 3-1/2 percent pace.Turning to the upper  left panel  of Chart  14,  these nominal  increaseshave  translated into relatively rapid  gains in real  wages,  especially  measuredin terms of product prices.  As may be seen,  gains in real compensation  perhour outstripped  the growth in trend productivity  last year,  and the gap  isexpected  to remain wide  this year and next.  As  a consequence,  the markupof prices  over trend  unit labor costs--shown  in the upper right panel--isexpected  to move  down still further in coming  quarters.One of the main factors  behind this apparent restraint  on the pricingpower of businesses  has been  the rapid expansion  of productive capacity.Manufacturing  capacity  utilization,  shown in the  middle  left panel,essentially  has been moving sideways  at a relatively neutral  level  for abouttwo  years.  Moreover,  we anticipate that the weakening  of activity in thefactory sector  will result in  some reduction  of utilization  rates  over the nextyear and  a half.  Consistent with the view that there  are few  pressures  onindustrial  capacity, purchasing  managers'  reports  on vendorperformance--the  right panel--have  been  nearly balanced in  recent monthsbetween  those reporting  slower deliveries  and those  reporting fasterdeliveries.In addition  to ample  domestic capacity, the spill-over from Asia has  lefta clear mark on global commodity markets  and should provide  some furtherdamping  of inflation  pressures.  Non-oil commodity  prices--the lower leftpanel--have  plummeted  over the  past year,  and we  are not anticipating muchif any recovery  in these  prices  over the forecast interval.  A rather similarstory has been  apparent in  oil markets.  Weakening  world demand  andexcess  inventories  that built up over the warm winter have  pushed pricessharply  lower in recent months.  We are expecting  efforts by OPEC  andnon-OPEC  producers  to result in only a limited rebound  in the spot price ofWest Texas  intermediate--the  black line in  the lower right panel--from  itsaverage  level  of about $13.50  per barrel  in June to  about $16.00  by earlynext year.The steep drop in oil prices that  has occurred  to date is expected  todepress consumer  energy prices--the  black bars in the upper  left panel ofChart 15--by  about  51/2 percent  this  year.  And, next year, retail  energyprices are  anticipated to retrace only  a small  part of this year's decline.With  regard to the  agricultural  outlook, considerable  uncertainty  alwaysattends  our forecast  at this point in the year.  But, in brief, we  are notprojecting  any significant  disruptions to production  that would move foodprice inflation--the red bars in the panel--off the  moderate  pace of the  pastyear or so.6/30-7/1/98The decline of core non-oil  import prices--the  upper right panel--isprojected  to steepen to a 2-1/4  percent rate this year,  after decreases of about3/4  percent in  each of the past two  years.  Although  we do not anticipate  anysharp reversal,  these prices  are likely to turn up next  year as the dollarretraces  some of its  recent gains  and as prices on world commodity marketsstabilize after their recent plunge.Slumping import prices  and  ample domestic  capacity in the goodssector have resulted in  somewhat greater disinflation  among consumercommodities--the  blue line  in the  middle panel--than  among consumerservices--the black line.  The 2-1/2  percentage  point gap between goods  andservices inflation  that has  opened up recently  is larger than the historicalnorm.  And, we are  expecting the  gap to remain  relatively  wide over thenext six quarters.All  told, we expect the total CPI--line  1 in the lower panel--to  pick upfrom a 1  percent pace this year to a 2-1/4  percent rate in  1999, pushed uplargely by less  favorable price developments  for energy and  imports.  Asyou know,  the stability that we are showing in our forecast of the coreCPI--line  2--masks an underlying  acceleration  of these  prices.  On  atechnically consistent basis--line 3--we expect a  pickup in core CPI inflationof about 1/2  percentage  point between  1997  and 1999.We present these technically  consistent figures  in the Greenbook inorder to facilitate a comparison  of our forecast with the historical publisheddata.  But, that should not obscure  the fact that we believe that changesbeing made to the CPI are  making it more  accurate  over time.  Line 4 in thetable--labeled  "actual"  CPI excluding  food and energy--provides  asomewhat  different  slant on this issue  by adjusting the historical  andprojected core CPI for our estimate  of the bias in each year.  Viewed fromthis perspective,  the 1/2 percentage  point acceleration  that we  are projectingboosts core CPI inflation  from slightly  above  1 percent  in  1997 to a bit lessthan  1  percent in  1999.  The final line in  the  table displays  our forecast  fortotal GDP prices  adjusted for measurement  bias.  On this basis,  we projectGDP prices to rise about 3/4  percent this year and  a bit more than  1 percentnext year.Chart 16 addresses  two risks to the forecast.  First, in light of recentdisappointing events in Asia, we consider a  still more pessimistic  scenariofor that region that hinges on  upcoming events in Japan.  Although therehave been  some signs  recently that the Japanese  government finally will actconclusion.  An  unfavorable  outcome in  the Upper House elections  in twoweeks  or growing concern  about the negative effects  of the credit crunchcould still result in policy inaction,  leading to a sharp further decline in theyen;  we have picked  175  yen  per dollar as the bottom in this scenario,6/30-7/1/98though  considerably weaker  numbers have been  bandied about  in recentChinese currency  pegs would give way and  that resulting  financial  marketturmoil would  drag Asian GDP down another 7 percent  below baseline bythe end of 1999.  We  also assume that  the contagion  would  spread to LatinAmerica and Eastern Europe,  with  reductions  in growth  there.  Finally, weassume that  the U.S.  stock market would take a 20 percent  hit.  In brief, thisis not yet the black hole scenario,  but it is taking  a few  steps closer to theedge.  Running this scenario through  the staff's model  with the federal  fundsrate held unchanged,  and allowing for feedbacks  to imports,  we get areduction in U.S. real net exports,  as shown by the  gap between the red andblack lines at the right, of about 1/2 percent of GDP by the end of 1999,roughly  similar to the  markdown in  net exports  since the January  Greenbookshown by the blue line.  The effect  of this shock on U.S.  exports  is larger,eventually reaching  1 percent  of GDP, but feedbacks  that reduce  importsalso cut the decline in  net exports.  In contrast,  a good deal of the decline innet exports since  January occurred because  imports were  stronger thanexpected.The second  alternative  scenario is a dollar  depreciation.  If events inAsia turn  out as our baseline forecast  assumes, with markets  beginning todwell  less on Asia's problems,  two factors  could begin  to weigh heavily onthe dollar.  One is events in Europe.  With jitters  over the introduction  of theeuro out of the  way and confidence brimming  with robust growth  inEuroland, there is a risk that the dollar's rise against  European currenciesover the past year and a half will be reversed.  Similarly, with  conditions inAsia beginning to  stabilize, the outsized  U.S. trade deficit and Asian tradesurpluses will attract  growing  attention in the markets.  In this scenario, wehave  the dollar fully reversing  its rise since  1996, with the mark/euro  goingto  1.40  and the yen to 120 by mid-1999.  As indicated at the right, this  17percent depreciation  of the  dollar generates  an 8 percent increase  in coreimport prices by the end of 1999.The implications  of these  scenarios for U.S.  GDP growth  and  inflationare shown  in the bottom panel.  With  the federal  funds  rate held unchanged,the pessimistic  Asia scenario  would reduce  GDP growth  to  1.3  percent inthe second half of 1998  and to less than  1 percent in  1999.  The drop in  thestock market accounts  for more than a  third of the effect.  The dollardepreciation would raise  GDP growth through  stimulus  to net exports.  Asindicated in  the last line  of the table,  it would also raise  CPI inflation  above3 percent in  1999  and close to 4 percent in  2000.  Mr. Prell will  nowcontinue our presentation.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The last exhibit is the usual  summary of the projectionsyou submitted for Humphrey-Hawkins  purposes.  If you scan  down thesecond column, where  we have  listed the central tendencies,  you will  see6/30-7/1/98that  most of you  are expecting real  GDP to grow  3  to 3-1/4  percent  over thefour quarters  of  1998,  with CPI inflation running  1-1/4 to 2 percent  for theyear and the jobless rate holding in a 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent range.  This is astronger,  more inflationary forecast  than ours,  and you remain  slightly to thehigh  side of the Greenbook  in  1999.  The central tendency  range for GDPgrowth  next year, at 2 to 2-1/2  percent, allows the unemployment rate to inchupward to between 4/2 and 4  percent, but inflation also edges up, into the2 to 2-1/2  percent range.We have included in the table the Administration's forecasts,  becausethese must be addressed  in the Humphrey-Hawkins  report.  As you  can see,in the mid-session  budget review document,  the Administration  predictedsmaller increases  in nominal  and real GDP than  your tentative  centraltendency  ranges for the two years and  a tad less inflation,  on average.  Ihave my doubts, though,  that this will lead to harsh criticism from theAdministration  that you are  intending to pursue  an excessivelyaccommodative  monetary  policy!This concludes  our presentation,  and we will  be happy  to answer anyquestions  you might wish to raise.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think that was one  of the better presentations thisCommittee has heard in a while.  The outlook is  very complex,  and I think  you  all handled itexceptionally well.Peter, what  is the potential  outcome in Latin America of current  account  deficits thatappear to be  getting out of hand?  There seem to be political  and other obstacles in Brazil,Argentina,  and perhaps  Mexico  to taking the types of actions that would lead to stabilization  inthose countries.  Concurrently,  we may have an  even worse situation  in Russia.  Do you havebreakdowns stemming  from contagion  in  your simulations  for those areas?

[SECTION]

MR.  HOOPER.  In the more pessimistic  simulation that we did, we had Asian  growthfalling by somewhere between  5  and  10 percent at an  annual rate  across countries.  We  assumedthat this weakness  would spread to Latin America  and growth  there would fall on the order  of 2to 3 percent.  There is obviously a risk that it could fall a good deal more.6/30-7/1/98The situation in Latin America  is a bit reminiscent  of that being experienced  a littleless than a year ago in Asia.  We are  seeing some  turbulence  in Latin American  financialseen indications  of slowing economic  activity in  some  of those  countries but also a fair amountof good news.  There seems  to be optimism in Argentina where  domestic  demand  is growingfairly strongly.  Mexico  has been hurt by the drop in oil  prices,  obviously, but domestic  demandthere seems resilient.  Nevertheless,  given the widening  current account  deficits we see in  thosecountries,  and perhaps  a little overvaluation  of their currencies,  though  nowhere near as much  aswe had in Mexico  in  1994, there clearly is a risk in that part of the world.  In Brazil, growth  hasbeen  sharply reduced  by monetary tightening in response to currency  pressures,  and risks remainhigh given  that country's large fiscal and external deficits  and the fact that President  Cardozo isin a  close election  race  with the leftist  labor candidate,  Mr. Lula.  We thought the pessimisticscenario  we picked was  a plausible one  that would involve a fair amount of contagion  followinga failure in Japan.  There is no question  that it could get a  good deal  worse.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  David, in Chart  14 you have  a table that shows realcompensation per hour and trend productivity.  Is that  real  consumption  per hour numberdeflated  by the CPI?

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  It is  deflated by the  nonfarm  business  price index.  So, it is aproduct  price  deflator.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for our colleagues?  PresidentBroaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I have  a  question, Mr. Chairman,  but first I would like to echoyour comments  about the staff presentation.  I have  been  watching these presentations  for a long6/30-7/1/98time,  along with Ed Boehne,  and  I thought this one  was particularly  well done,  especially thefocus  on the international  context.My question  has to do with inventories.  I have seen  a fair amount  of commentaryrecently  to the effect  that a good part of the buildup in  inventories in the first quarter, more thannormal,  involved  imported goods.  I was looking for some  reference  to this in the  Greenbook, butI didn't see  any.  The commentary suggests  that the inventory correction  may have  a relativelysmall impact  on the behavior  of final demand in the United States  going forward.  Is thereanything to that?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  As you know,  there are  no direct  observations  on this.  One significantelement in the rapid accumulation  of inventories in the first quarter was  oil.  Clearly,  the greaterflexibility in supply in the short run will  be  on the import side as opposed  to domesticproduction.  So, as that buildup in oil stocks  unwinds, we would  expect the impact to be more onthe  import side.  Actually,  we have seen some  further accumulation  in the second quarter as bestwe can  tell.  The buildup has gotten  to the point where  there is not much more room for storingoil.  Some is  probably being stored  on ships in distant places on the  oceans.  We  expect thiscontinuing  accumulation  of oil inventories to end in  the near term.Outside the oil  sector, if we look at the normal ratios  of imports to various  categoriesof domestic expenditures,  I think we can make  a case that a very substantial  component  of theinventory pickup in the first quarter was probably in  imports.  There have  been anecdotes  to theeffect that  some stock building  has occurred  to take  advantage of bargains that were  availableeither in components  or in finished  goods.  So, yes, we think that  while a complex  interaction  isinvolved--just  because  something was imported doesn't mean that the  offset will be  in imports in6/30-7/1/98the future;  the adjustment could still involve  displacing domestic production--our  forecastcontemplates  this in terms of our overall import  growth  and our domestic  spending  patterns.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We did get  a calculation  that supports what  Mike Prellis saying.  On  average, about a quarter  of inventories  are imported  goods.  Assuming all  of theincrease in oil inventories  in the first quarter was imports,  considering the limited  capacity  of thedomestic  production  system, and making a lot of assumptions  with respect to the shares ofdifferent  types of industry inventories that are imported  or not imported, we  end up with  a shademore than a third of the inventory buildup being imported out of the one hundred-odd  billiondollar annual rate increase  in  the first  quarter.  So,  there is no question that the first-quarterbuildup is comprised  disproportionately  of imports but not predominantly  so.  The bulk of theinventory change in the first quarter involves  domestic production.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mike, on  Chart 10  you have a  fairly dramatic  decline in the growthrate of real  personal consumption.  I understand  that part of that comes  from the peaking of thewealth-to-income  ratio--the  stock market weakness.  What  other factors create  that downdraft?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Part of it is simply an  assessment of what the underlying  trends wouldbe and  the fact that consumer spending was at such a high level  in the first quarter.  Even ifsecond-quarter  consumer expenditures  were to drop off to the 4 percent plus  growth  area,  orsomewhat  below our forecast, the first half would  still be very  strong.  That  is a  significantelement in the picture.  Another is that  the second  quarter would be weaker still  were it not forthe extra incentives  that were provided for auto purchases,  and that is a factor  that will reverse  inthe  second half of the  year.  So, it is distorting the  intra-yearly  pattern.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I would like to  make three comments.  The first is a  plea onterminology  dealing with  net exports.  We know  as a matter of arithmetic  that I plus C plus  Gminus net imports equals  output; that is arithmetic.  But to say that net imports  are  a drag onoutput is making an  assumption about  causation  that I do not think should be there.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I think we crossed the Rubicon on  this.  We recognize that it is hard toexpress this thought, but we have come to the conclusion that everyone understands this area.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I'm not so sure about that, but I think it is  very easy to express that in adifferent way.  We can  simply say that total spending  exceeds total output  when net exports arenegative.  I think it is too easy to slip into a  wrong frame of mind on  this.  My plea  is to beaccurate on the terminology  here.Secondly,  when  I looked up oil price  futures in the newspaper this morning,  August ofthis year to August of next year, I saw  Brent oil futures going from $14  to $17  per barrel.  I thinkthat  is a substantially  larger increase than you have,  so you might  want to comment  on why yourview differs  from that in the futures  market.Thirdly,  and this is the most important comment, it seems to me that the internalstructure  of your forecast  makes  perfect  sense if growth  in final  sales slows.  The components  ofthe forecast would be internally consistent.  But I  still do not understand  where the drive to slowthe growth of aggregate  demand comes from.  The real federal  funds rate is falling during thisperiod because  you have  the  CPI rising  and  presumably  inflation  expectations,  at least in themodel,  are consistent  with the CPI.  We assume  the market is  smart and  sees what is going  on sothat  the real  funds rate is falling.  The only retarding  influence  in the  forecast  is the impact fromAsia.  It reminds  me  a lot of the  debates when  I first came into this profession  in  the late  1960swhen we were hanging  everything  for a slowdown  of the economy on federal  fiscal restraint.6/30-7/1/98The Asian impact is  very much like a restraining  fiscal policy.  We all know what happened  inthe late  1960s environment.  The fiscal restraint  in  1968  did not in fact slow  the economy.  So, Iam very worried that we are putting much too much weight on Asia in  this outlook and that weare not paying enough  attention  to the  underlying  strength of aggregate  demand as  driven byvery accommodative  monetary and  credit conditions.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Peter Hooper will  say something in response to  your question  about oilprices.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOOPER.  Just to  address  the oil  price question,  I think the jump in the futuresreflected  OPEC's recent agreement  to cut production  by somewhat more  than we had  assumed inour forecast.  Our oil  experts doubt  that OPEC  will come through  and  actually restrainproduction  as  much as the  agreement  suggests.  But there is some  upside risk in the oil priceforecast  in light of these  very recent  events.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think one has to ask, too, whether  the current prices  are notabnormally low  because  of the oil  storage constraints.  We  are getting  a contango in  the marketthat may be  extreme.  There also  are some  fine points  in the current  situation that may beexaggerated.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Peter Hooper is right.  You are  a little  ahead of us in  terms oflooking  at the newspapers  this morning.  The  Greenbook as  of the  time it went to bed  actuallyhad an implied monthly  forecast  through the  end  of the  year that was almost  the  same as  thelargely  a function  of the  market's  adding  some risk premium  about uncertainties  such  as whetherIraq  will continue  to produce  and so forth.  That actually  has been  a feature  of most of the recentforecasts  in the  sense that we  go with  a point estimate  of supply  and the market has more  of an6/30-7/1/98uncertainty  band around it and therefore  has a risk premium built  into it after six months out.But through December  as of the time the Greenbook  went to bed, the forecasts  were  very close.More recently,  as Peter  said, we had the OPEC  announcement  on Tuesday and the currentlearned  about the OPEC  decision.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  As  to the general  outlook  for domestic demand,  your point is welltaken.  There is an  alternative  view in which  the multiplier-accelerator  effects that  flow from theexternal  shock and the inventory  investment correction are inadequate  to precipitate  the kind ofslowing of employment  growth and domestic demand expansion that we are anticipating.  Werethe stock market  to continue  going up, that would certainly  add something to the prospectivegrowth of domestic  demand.  We have  been surprised repeatedly  in the last couple of years, and Icannot rule out a further surprise.  On  the  other hand, one could point to some risks on the otherside.  We have had very high  rates of accumulation  of consumer and producer durables.  Thecapacity  utilization  rate in manufacturing  is  already below  its historical  average,  and if indeedprofitability  begins  to wane  and manufacturers  decide  they want to cut back  some more, therecould be a weaker business investment picture  than we have  projected.We think this is a reasonably balanced forecast.  Our model  simulations  in effect saythat we currently  have rather high real  interest  rates.  If we take out the extra stimulus  that hasbeen  coming from the outsized  increase in share prices, at least as many models would interpretthat  stimulus, we then have  this factor weighing on demand going  forward.  So, I think a casecan be made on either side  of this forecast.  I cannot rule out your being right.  If you had saidthis a year ago, we would  have been in  the same position  and you would have been  proven  to bethe one  who was  correct.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There is  an interesting issue here.  Everyone has  beenwrong by underestimating domestic demand  and wrong in the other direction by  overestimatinginflation.  The  area where  the error is crucial  has been  productivity  because  as productivitygrowth has accelerated,  expectations  about  earnings  over the  long run have  moved up.  This hascreated  a major increase in  stock prices  and a  virtuous circle wealth effect.  We end up with (1)much higher domestic  demand and  (2) lower prices because  of the acceleration  in productivitythat has occurred.  The Greenbook forecast  incorporates  a significant  slowdown  in earningsgrowth, which in turn comes  largely from  a slowdown in  productivity  gains.  If that happens,then the growth  in spending on capital  goods  also  slows and that creates  some negative internalmultipliers that conform  total  spending to  the Greenbook  forecast  of much slower expansion indemand.  The only thing that presumably could keep  the stock market  on a rising trend is that weare wrong again on productivity.  That would mean that earnings  expectations,  which  are now inthe area of 13  or 14 percent over the five-year time  frame used by security analysts,  wouldcontinue to move up, stock prices would continue  to move up, and effective  demand  wouldcontinue to rise quite substantially.  The unanswered  question  is what would happen  to inflationin that context.  That is why I think the  crucial error in our forecast  models  has been  theproductivity numbers.  I believe  it is a mistake to view the issue of having been wrong on the realside independently  of also having been  wrong on the inflation  side.  The implication  of theanalysis we have relied  on is that if domestic  demand is  consistently underestimated  in the futureand the Greenbook  is wrong, inflation  will be  stronger.  That is not necessarily true because theeffect on inflation depends  on where the domestic  demand is coming from.I would say at this point that we have a very  tough  set of forecasts to  make on bothsides.  I am not terribly certain  where the  balance  effectively  may be.  My own concern,  as I will6/30-7/1/98try to express tomorrow,  is that the odds  of a very significant  negative effect in the internationalarea, while  still low,  are rising.  That is where the  big downside  potential lies.  The upsidepotential  is that the  stock market will continue to rise independently  of any  productivity changes,and we  will get serious  inflationary pressures coming  largely from the wage  side, as wediscussed.  I think we are  in an area now where both the upside  and the downside  risks are muchlarger than we  have been  presuming.  I am  not sure that  we can merely look at whether we areunderestimating the demand  side.  We may well be doing so,  but it is crucially  important todetermine why.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  There is an  obvious  circularity in our forecast in  that, were  it not for theslowing of demand, we would not have  the cyclical  deceleration  in productivity  that DaveStockton  talked about  and the related deterioration  in profits.  It's not that we are anticipatingany deterioration  in the productivity  trend.  In fact, we are  anticipating a  continuation  of the morefavorable  trend that  we have estimated for the past couple of years.  It has  been in a  sense asupply  shock of the type President  Jordan has  talked  about a number of times.  That supplyshock,  working through  the stock market  as  you described, has created the compensatingaggregate demand to absorb  that  additional  supply.  In  a sense,  as we have shown in simulationsin  the past, we need a  higher real interest  rate to equilibrate  things in the face  of that kind ofshock.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  Peter, I just wanted  a few more  details  on the pessimistic  Asiascenario.  When  you  start out  with the yen  depreciation in  that scenario, do  you  "add factor"down  any  other parts  of Japanese  aggregate  demand or is that the hit on it?

[SECTION]

MR.  HOOPER.  We  "add factored"  both the  yen and  aggregate  demand.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  We  stipulated  that we were  going to reduce growth.  What we didwas  to impose  an exogenous  negative  psychological  or confidence  effect on  Japanese  aggregatedemand in  the model.  Everything  else equal,  if the yen  were to depreciate  to the extent  that itdoes in the pessimistic  scenario, the model  would normally  give us  a rise in Japanese  GDP.  Westipulated  that this  was a combination  of a currency  shock and an  aggregate demand  shockthrough  confidence effects.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  So, the falling Asian  GDP is imposed  exogenously.  Let us  comeback, then,  and follow  through on President Broaddus's  suggestion that we  let the yendepreciate,  whether it is to  160 or 175.  If you had not imposed  the exogenous  shocks toaggregate  demand  in Japan  and the rest of Asia and had just assumed that the  prevailingweakness  in  Japan,  if we stepped back  and allowed  it to happen, would  lead to this  depreciation,how  would that have changed  your overall  view of this  picture?

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  If all  you do is let the yen go,  this  is positive for Japan.  The effect  ofthis  currency shock on the rest of Asia is not that  large in the model.  The model does  not pick upthe  related  uncertainty  and confidence effects.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  So,  the Chinese  currency would hold and the Hong Kong  spilloverswould be contained.

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  Another  shortcoming of the  model is that it does not captureborrowing  denominated  in foreign  currencies,  and  the wealth  effects  are rather minimal.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Governor  Meyer, I think the problem  here, if you want  to put it in  aslightly different way, is that these Asian countries whose  currencies  have  lost 30, 50, or 80percent  of their value and have negative  growth  rates  of 20 percent of GDP present a challenge6/30-7/1/98for economics  to explain.  Whether we talk about  the functioning of the economy  as workingthrough the financial  markets  or other dimensions  of the confidence  process,  it is certainly  areasonable proposition that  we  do not have  to have simultaneous  currency depreciations  andnegative  growth.  But it is  also, I think,  a reasonable  proposition that this kind of accelerated  freefall of currencies  more often  than not is associated with declines  in real GDP rather  thanincreases in real  GDP.  Declines do not occur in  all circumstances.  There  was a depreciation  ofsterling and the lira in  the fall of 1992, and that was positive for European  growth.  In the contextof a financial crisis,  which Japan  certainly is experiencing,  it is hard to imagine that adepreciation  of the yen in the short run would  actually improve  growth in  a  substantial  way.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I want to ask  a general  question about the way  we thinkabout  Japan.  This may build on  Governor Meyer's  question.  A number of the Committeemembers recently  have  been in Japan,  and I would be  interested in their views about the problemand potential  solutions, as  well as  staff comments.We sometimes  read commentaries  about Japan  that, it seems to me, are based on apremise that it has an  economy that tends to stagnate  or decline in the absence of some type ofmonetary  or fiscal stimulus  or pump priming  to get it going.  These commentators  do not seem tobelieve as I do that the nature of a market economy is  to display an  inherent resiliency  and atendency  to expand in the  absence  of negative  impulses.  When  I try to figure  out what ispreventing  expansion in an  economy like that, I look for headwinds  problems like  our own in theearly part of this decade.6/30-7/1/98One way to think  about Japan  in my view is that over the course of the  1990s  theJapanese have  been  learning that Japan  is not immune  to the  law  of one price  any more  thanother countries.  Sometimes analysts,  especially academic  types,  tend to think of exchange  ratesmainly in terms of a fairly narrow  set of tradable goods.  It is almost  as if the  relative  cost ofproducing  a car in Yokohama versus Lexington,  Kentucky  will  determine  the exchange  rate.Obviously, that simply is  not the case in  global  capital  markets.  Asset markets  have as  muchimpact on exchange rates  as manufactured  goods,  and that includes commercial  and residentialreal estate  as  well as other asset markets.Ten years ago  if we had held aside  the  narrow set of exportable  manufacturing  goodsof Japan and focused  on everything else--commercial  and residential real  estate, equity prices, awhole host of things  about Japan--translated  through  a filter of the prevailing exchange rate  andwe had learned we would have predicted  one of two things:  deflation ordevaluation.  We would have  anticipated  that either the exchange  value of the yen  would declinedramatically  or the price  level in terms of the yen  would decline  dramatically.  We could have  satback and  waited for something to happen.  Yet, we have  gone through  a  long period of time withthe idea that the  yen  was  somehow  undervalued  and needed to go up.  It seems  to me  that is  likesaying  that in the late  1920s  the British were  right in repegging the pound at the pre-World War Iprice of gold.  All they had to do was to  let prices  denominated  in  pounds fall,  including theprices of real  estate, hamburgers,  and everything else  sold in  the U.K. economy.For people  who have  traveled  to Japan  and looked at the situation there more closelythan I have,  how close  or how  far is  Japan to having adjusted  to the rest of the world in terms ofthe yen prices  of residential  and commercial  real  estate,  a cup  of coffee,  and everything else  sothat normal economic policies  may work?6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Did you have  to eat  one to find that out?

[SECTION]

MR.  HOOPER.  There has been  a longstanding  dichotomy of views about theequilibrium  exchange  rate for the yen.  Most PPP indices  have it somewhere between  150 and200, depending on which  one we  look at on which  date.  Most models that focus  on the externalbalance would put it between  100  and  120.  Perhaps one way of looking  at it is to anticipate  thatin the very long term the yen will gravitate  to a real  rate consistent with  the 150  to 200 range as  aresult of domestic price  adjustments but that in the intermediate  term, given  the pressures  fromthe market relating to the external  balance,  the yen will most likely go  the other way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Isn't the  arbitrage  value  of the yen  vis-a-vis  the dollarunder  100 if we go ten years out?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That comes from  the 10-year bond yield.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I gather that bond  yield spreads imply a covered rate forthe yen, which,  as I recall, is well under  100  for a ten-year horizon.  That is the type of issue thatPresident Jordan  is raising, namely the real  disequilibrium  in the  current yen  exchange rate.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  You have to build in deflation  in Japan  in  order to get the internaleconomy and external  economy back in balance.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  To come to that part of your question, it seems  to me  that twoaspects  are involved.  One  is that, as with everything else  with Japan, it is difficult  to tell.  Inparticular, as you mentioned,  part of the dimension  of the disinflationary  process  has to do withthe current  level  of asset prices.  There, in particular,  the asset price  situation has  not yetstabilized, and in turn that is related in part to what they have  not done  and what they may beunwilling to do to clean up their banking  and financial  system. Therefore,  we may have  anundervaluation  in the yen  relative to its long-run  equilibrium,  but that  is in some sense my viewof what the Japanese  have to do to deal  with it.Your colleagues,  who spent more time in  Japan than I did, can  comment  on the factthat Japan  still has a  remarkably prosperous  economy,  especially in Tokyo.  When we talk toJapanese  officials  about their economy,  they will tell us that if we  look at the  department  storeswe will  see a lot of customers;  everybody  is buying;  everybody  is well dressed.  It does not strikean  outside observer as an  economy  in  a depressed  state.  That may  say more about whetheradvanced  industrial economies  can sustain  extended  periods of no  growth,  which is  not what wehave been used to assuming.  But given  what Japan  started from in terms  of wealth  and standardof living, I think that in fact  a large  proportion of the  Japanese economy  can very easily sustainextended periods of slow  growth.  That, in  turn,  contributes to their lack of urgency in trying  tosolve  some of the  fundamental  problems  associated  with their banking and financial  system.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  They have  a very rich economy,  with incomeand wealth rather well  distributed.  That gives  them a  capacity  to continue  an inappropriatepolicy for a fairly extended  period  of time.  They  also have  a relatively content electorate  so thatthere is  not the pressure on  the elected officials  that  would normally come  in  some  countries  suchas our  own.6/30-7/1/98I think another aspect of President Jordan's question relates  to an  assumption that theJapanese economy  is more of a  market economy than it really is.  It  is a command  economy thatworked rather well for an extended period of time because  the people  commanding  it did areasonably  good job.  That command  structure  has  broken  down to a large  extent, but there is notenough pressure, except that brought by foreigners  including  recent visitors,  to say to the peoplerunning the country  that they simply are not going to be allowed to let their currency  devalue andexport their way out of the current economic  difficulties because the rest of the world will  notpermit it.  We, the rest  of the world, will bring enough  pressure to bear on you to make it clearthat rising exports  are not a  solution you  will have the  luxury to  use.  That may be good policy orbad policy, but if we look at the effect  on the United  States and on Europe  of having to absorbthe cost of the Asian  crisis, we can easily see where the pressure on Japan is going to come fromto manage its economy  in a way that is more hospitable  for its neighbors  in Asia and lessdemanding  on the  rest of the world.  Japan  will have to fill the role that I think we can properlyascribe  to them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Gramlich.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  I have  a different question, but I am intrigued  by this discussion.My question about Japan  gets  back to the forecast.  As I recall  our previous  financial  crisis in thiscountry,  whose severity I would judge to be  about one-tenth that of Japan's current  financialcrisis, it was some time before there was sufficient recognition  that the problem  lendinginstitutions, the  S&Ls in our case,  had to be cleaned up.  I  don't know how  long Japan's  bankshave been in a problem  situation, but I think it is within the two- or three-year horizon that itfinally took us to act on  our financial crisis.  So, I think the  fact that economic  conditions  seemprosperous  in Tokyo can  be a little misleading because the  Japanese  have not yet started  to lose6/30-7/1/98their assets.  Of course, they've lost a lot in terms  of real  estate values,  but they haven't started tolose much  in terms of their financial assets.  When we  put all of that together,  it looks  as if theyhave some  distance  to fall before  things get righted.Let me get back to the  forecast.  The one number  that struck me was on Chart  6.Japan's GDP for the second half is rising at a  1.9 percent  annual rate.  I understand  that there willbe  a big change in  their fiscal policy, but it strikes  me that a realistic  forecast  might be to gomore to the pessimistic  Asia  scenario than to look for this rapid bounce  back.

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  We see further weakness  in Japan's private domestic  demand.  Thatclearly is a result of anticipated difficulties  in the process  of resolving Japan's  banking  crisis.Over the second half of the year, there is no question  that the banking problem will  continue toweigh  on the performance  of the Japanese  economy.  We have chosen  to write down  a relativelymoderate  further decline  in private investment  after a fairly significant  drop in  the  past fewquarters  and  some further decrease  in consumption  after the declines  registered over the pastyear.  We are  starting from a low base.  The declines  in these two  key sectors have resulted in  asignificant further reduction  in GDP in the  second quarter.  I agree  with you  that, despiteimpending  large fiscal  stimulus,  there is a downside risk in  our second-half forecast.  There isalso the possibility  that if Japanese  officials  made a clear statement about resolving theirbanking-sector problems and  actually started to implement  remedial  polices and their financial

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  To follow up with a comment  on Governor  Gramlich's  questionabout Japan:  Just looking at these  charts, I assume  that if you  have their real  exports  flat and realimports declining, then you have built in a very substantial  decline in real  domestic  consumptionin Japan.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR.  HOOPER.  Yes,  domestic private  consumption in  our forecast  does  fall throughthe second  half of the year.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Let me  ask, Jerry,  was the nature  of your question  to ask how  far theyhave left to fall?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  That is part of it, insofar  as  deflation rather  than depreciation  of thecurrency is the  solution.  One of those two things has to happen.  If the second  solution reflects  acorrect interpretation  of the environment,  does any  amount of monetary  or fiscal  pump primingdo any good?

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  On the  fiscal  side, there  is no question.  Over the past three or fouryears,  the  growth that we have seen  in Japan has  been largely  associated  with movements  inJapan's  structural  budget  deficit.  In  1996,  they had a large  fiscally-induced  expansion  of GDP.At the time, we thought  conditions were  beginning to turn  around  in Japan.  They withdrew  thatfiscal  stimulus in  1997,  and the  economy dropped  off sharply.  In the bottom left panel  of thatof 2 percent  of GDP in  1997.  It was not surprising that Japan's  economy weakened  substantiallybetween  those two  years.  The fiscal  expansion expected  for 1998  is going to be  crowded  largelyinto the second half of the year.  Our  view  is that  if they get progress  on the financialside--financial  restructuring  and banking reform--and  the  economy begins  to pick up as  a resultof this fiscal push,  households will  start to have  a brighter outlook.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I have  two questions  about Japan.  First, I know that a program hasbeen proposed on the fiscal side, but a lot of forecasters  assume  that perhaps  only one-quarter  or6/30-7/1/98one-half of that involves  actual  economic  stimulus.  What  assumption has  been made in  theGreenbook  forecast?  I hope it does not incorporate  the announced  program in full.

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  We looked  at the numbers  carefully  in this regard  and madejudgments  based on  the past relationship between  the announced  numbers and the  so-called  "realwater" content of the package.  The numbers  on actual  investment spending in the announcedpackage  account  for about three-quarters  of the overall  spending and the tax  cuts  for one-quarter.The tax cuts  are spread over the next couple of years.  The spending  also is fairly evenlydistributed.  I have forgotten  exactly what the gap is between  the "real water" and the headlinenumber, but it is fairly significant.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Where  does the term  "real water"  come from?  Is thatthe Japanese translation?  What is  "non-real  water?"  Does it have to do with priming the pump?[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  With no water in  it!  My second  question  is how would you assess  theextent of a credit crunch  in Japan  at the present  time?  I know there is  some  debate  about  thatbecause banks obviously  do not have  an appetite  to lend.  At the same time, we  do not see  someof the  typical characteristics  of a credit crunch,  notably rising interest rates.  Do you  see thisplaying a major role?

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  We  see it as beginning  to have a  significant impact.  Probably thebest indicator is the Tankan  survey of business  perceptions  of the lending  attitudes of banks.  Thesurvey results  are  shown  in the middle right panel  on  Chart 6.  They indicate  a rather largeJapanese  banking experts were  questioning the  existence  of a credit  crunch  and attributing the6/30-7/1/98weakness  in  lending to a  slowdown  in demand.  Now, with these  survey results and  a lot ofsupporting  anecdotes,  one cannot ignore the possibility that there is something significant there.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I would like to make a partial  response to  an issue that Jerry Jordanraised about  what type of policy Japan  should  pursue.  In the  area of monetary  policy, I think wecannot  talk about that very  effectively  until we have had our discussion  of the last item ontoday's agenda because  I think theology may be  required to  answer what monetary  policy isappropriate  in Japan.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Jerry, to return to  your two descriptions  of internal  deflation orexternal  devaluation,  my observation  of what is happening  in Japan is that they have  experiencedan enormous  amount of deflation that has not  been recognized;  they have  put it off.  I amreferring to the portfolios  of their banks, which are  exerting enormous  pressure.  As theseunsupportable  liabilities to cash flows  are being valued down  and eventually recognized,  I thinkwe are  seeing the effects  in  the form of both internal  deflation  and external devaluation.  I thinkthey  have a distance  to  go.  Their public  estimates of the  losses are  now anywhere  from $250billion to  $500 billion.  That is a lot to work through.  The  fiscal issue  is how much  of the lossesthey  are going to bail out through  government  spending.  I think they have  a long way to  go.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Would  somebody like to begin the Committeediscussion?  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  On the national  economy,  as  a new  paradigm optimist, I am lookingfor somewhat stronger economic  growth, somewhat  less inflation,  and lower unemploymentrates in my Humphrey-Hawkins  projection than the Greenbook  forecast.  I was pleased to seetoday that that puts me within the central  tendencies on everything but the CPI, where myforecast is  barely under the central tendency.  I readily  admit, however, that my level  ofuncertainty regarding  these forecasts has increased considerably  since the last  meeting.  I havebecome  increasingly  concerned  about the potential impact  of Asian difficulties on our economy.The downside  risks for both this year and next have risen in my view.  It is my feeling that  anyeconomic  weakness from Asia that spills  over to our economy would be  accompanied by evenlower levels  of inflation than we have had in  the last year or two.  As  for the  second quarter thatends  today, my forecast at the moment is for a real growth rate  of 3.3 percent.The Eleventh  District economy  has continued to expand.  I mentioned in the last twomeetings  that the rate  of growth  seemed to be slowing,  led by the traded goods  sectors, whichhave been  impacted heavily  by Asia and other forces  as well.  Again, it is oil, semiconductors,farming,  and Mexico that are  slowing the overall  rate of growth.  At the same  time, the  serviceand construction  sectors are  having difficulty  keeping  up with demand.  Oil prices hit a  12-yearlow of $11.56  two weeks ago.  Inventories  are  said to be so high that  oil  is being loaded  ontotankers,  as Mike Prell  mentioned earlier, that have no destination.  They are just being used forstorage.  This supply overhang from a  very mild winter in the United States  and Europe togetherwith weak  demand from Asia  has brought about steep declines  in prices despite output cutbacksin  recent months.  This oversupply situation  is expected to continue because  1.5  million  barrels6/30-7/1/98per day of new  capacity  are due  to come on line by  the end of the  year.  Normally, thedownstream  energy business in refining  and chemicals would be helped by the lower price ofinputs.  But that does not seem to be the case right now, partly because  lower demand fromSoutheast  Asia has put downward pressure on those product prices.The glut of computer chips is causing a restructuring  of the high-tech  industry in ourregion.  The  increased demand for the sub-$1,000  computers has hurt the sale of higher-endcomputers  and reduced  profit margins.  Asian  weakness has hurt the  demand for PCs, cellphones,  and other wireless  products  that use chips.  All of this has occurred  at a time when globalovercapacity  in chip production would have been  a problem by itself.  The large chipmanufacturers  in Korea halted production in their factories  for at least a week  in June in a futileeffort to curb falling chip  prices.  Samsung is the largest  chipmaker in the  world with  19  percentof the market.  Samsung, Hyundai,  and  LG Semicon have 40 percent of the  world's DRAMthe elimination  of 3,500 jobs.  One of the plants  it sold was  a joint venture  it had with Hitachi  inRichardson,  Texas  right outside of Dallas.  Hitachi  had to sell its  share in  an effort to deleverageits  balance sheet.  Now the deleveraging,  which  is becoming  so prevalent  in Asia, is happeninghere.Parts of our agricultural  sector have been  hit hard by a drought  that is  spreadingacross west and south Texas.  The cotton crop in non-irrigated regions is  virtually nonexistent.Even irrigated crops are  at risk because many farmers have  already  used up their  allotments ofirrigation water.On the other  side of the coin,  the Eleventh District still enjoys  one the fastest  rates ofemployment  growth in the  country.  Our construction  sector is still booming.  Construction6/30-7/1/98employment  growth  remains  strong.  Single-family  and multifamily permits continue toincrease.  Residential  contract  values are  up, and office vacancy rates continue  to decline  allover Texas.  As  a result,  shortages  of concrete  and labor have spread to sheetrock  andinsulation.  I mentioned at our last  meeting that  the shortage of concrete  was  so serious that  itmight affect  construction  of the new Texas  A&M football  stadium even  though a number oftheir alumni  produce concrete.  That has happened  and they  are postponing  the completion  untilthe following season.  The Aggies  have lobbied for a tightening  of monetary policy to make  thecurrent concrete  shortage  go away.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  There  is material  for a joke in there  somewhere!

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The Mexican economy  slowed  substantially during the first quarter,particularly  after the  correct seasonal  adjustments  are  made to the official  data.  Mexican  oilrevenues  have been  hurt by lower oil prices  and by Mexico's  decision to join Saudi  Arabia andVenezuela  in  a futile attempt to cut production  in the  hope of stabilizing  prices.  This has cutgovernment  revenues  and expenditures  have been reduced  as well.  The rate  of growth inMexican exports  of manufactured  goods  has slowed and  this trend is expected  to continue  asAsian exports  and labor become  relatively  cheaper.  The  deceleration  in the Mexican economyadds to the downside risks for the Texas  economy  over our forecast  horizon.Back to the national  economy:  The  downside  risks for the economy have risen  sincethe last meeting.  Inflation  statistics  over the  last two months have  raised some  concerns,  butsigns of inflationary  strain  are lacking in goods  markets, and long-term inflation  expectationscontinue  to fall.  The Asian crisis  has and  will continue  to exert  a downward  impact on inflationby lowering  commodity prices  and the prices  of imports generally.  And if it has  not alreadydone so, the crisis will have a longer-term restraining  effect on inflation through its moderating6/30-7/1/98influence  on U.S.  output and employment  growth.  The yield curve,  and I am referring  to the10-year yield minus  the  1-year yield, is  telling us  that slower economic  growth  is imminent.  Anegative  yield curve  has preceded  seven  out of the last six recessions,  the one exception being in1996 when  a recession  did not occur.  The world economy  is especially  sensitive  to U.S.  policychanges  at this time.  Through  its impact on net exports, an unexpected tightening  would have  amuch stronger-than-usual  negative  effect on the U.S. economy.  There are  very few signs ofproduction  bottlenecks and unfilled  orders,  and supply deliveries  suggest that inflation  pressuresare easing.  Our directors  and other  contacts continue  to tell us that their pricing power is at anall-time  low.  Market  indicators such  as the price of gold and commodity price indexes say thesame.  As I weigh the risks, I think a  strong case  can be made for a more balanced  view of theeconomic  outlook.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic  growth in  New Englandcontinues  to be strong.  Employment is growing  at about the  same rate in our region  as  in thenation, while  the unemployment  rate is more than  1/2 percentage point lower.  Massachusettsleads the region  in job growth,  outstripping the national  rate, and Maine  and  Connecticut aresecond  and  third in the  nation, behind  Alaska, in  the size of their decline  in joblessness  over thepast 12  months.  The region mirrors  the  nation in  the types of jobs being created.  Constructionis vibrant,  followed by  services.  While  manufacturing jobs declined  slightly in May, theyremained a  full percentage point above year-earlier  levels.  Labor markets continue to  be very6/30-7/1/98tight, especially  for skilled workers.  It is reported that Fidelity has 4,000 openings,  while JohnHancock,  only recently  enmeshed  in downsizing,  is trying to hire  a substantial  number ofworkers  as  well.  Consumer prices rose 2-1/2 percent  from a  year earlier in the region  with  wagesgrowing  at about the same pace.  Our contacts  see  little change  in overall  wage inflation;however, personnel  supply firms report wage hikes for temporary workers  in the  5  percent rangefor less  skilled individuals and increases  ranging  up to 20 percent for highly  skilled technicalworkers.  Contacts  mentioned  growing  use of incentive-based  salary  increases  as a method ofkeeping base wage  advances  modest and overall  wage  bills  expanding no faster than  sales orrevenues.he commented that the GM strike was likely to be short.  At  thatpoint, only one plant was  involved.  I  saw him recently  and asked  about his  prognosis  now.  Hestill believes  the  strike will not be long, though it has  surfaced  tensions  within the UAW itself onhow to deal  with GM.  However,  his  assessment  of the length  of the strike  should be taken  in thecontext  of the fact that is just about to end a  strike of three  years'  durationin Detroit.  [Laughter]  More  interesting from the point  of view  of this Committee  meeting,however, is the fact that  from his perspective,  more are  now in preparatory  steps tolabor action than  he has  seen  over a considerable  period  of time.Confidence remains  high in New  England, but in our Beigebook calls  concerns  werevoiced about the length of the expansion  and the impact  of the turmoil  in Asia.  Earlier this year,6/30-7/1/98regional  retailers  expected  little impact  from Asia.  Now they are less  sanguine, but the size ofthe  negative  effect is  uncertain.Real  estate markets  remain robust, with the  strengths  first  seen in Massachusetts  nowin evidence  in all  the  New England  states.  Inventories  of homes  are short,  and residential  pricesare rising,  though only at  a rate  slightly  above that of the nation.  Some speculative  constructionis now occurring.  The chief investment officer for John Hancock attends  a regular breakfastmeeting that I hold.  He notes  that Hancock  sees  tight real estate markets  across  the country withespecially fast growth  in Houston, Phoenix,  and Orlando.  He expects  prices to continue to risethough perhaps at a  slower pace.  Hancock  plans toMore broadly, on the  national  scene our forecast is more  optimistic  about growth  andmore pessimistic  regarding inflation than  the  Greenbook's.  We do not see as  large  an effectfrom  an inventory correction  for several  reasons.  First, inventory  buildups in  bothmanufacturing  and retail  have not had much  of an effect on inventory-sales  ratios.  In particular,retail  inventory accumulation  is largely  in nondurables  for which  sales have been  brisk of late.Survey data, in particular  the NAPM  survey,  do not indicate  concerns  regarding inventories.Inventory buildups,  as  we mentioned earlier in  our discussion,  could also reflect  a desire  to lockin lower material  and  supply costs  in the  face  of future  needs; this  seems particularly likely  in thearea  of petroleum inventories,  which  by some accounts  made a sizable  contribution  to the  pace ofinventory  accumulation  in the  first quarter relative  to  that in the  second half of 1997.  I thinkMike Prell  mentioned that as well.  Finally,  the buildup in  wholesale inventories,  which hasaffected inventory-sales  ratios,  is largely in the durable goods  area, likely  reflecting both a6/30-7/1/98idea that imports of capital  goods  grew substantially  during the first quarter.  Thus, it may be thateven the manufacturing  inventory buildup was intended and that its inevitable slowdown  will hitforeign producers  as well as domestic producers.With stronger growth  in  1998,  our forecast  sees the unemployment  rate falling slightlyand inflation as measured  by the  core CPI picking up, as it clearly has in the first months of1998.  Looking forward  to  1999,  even assuming a modest policy tightening, inflation in  ourforecast  tilts  upward more than in the Greenbook.  Clearly, there  are risks to this forecast.  Ourassessment of the inventory  correction could be  off the mark.  Our judgment about the impact ofAsia, which  is not terribly different  from the Greenbook's,  could be wrong  and Asia's  impactscould  be worse.  A stock  market correction could damp consumer confidence  and rein inspending or the  very age of the expansion could begin to damp consumption.  However, I shouldnote that our forecast  as  well as the Greenbook's  and other forecasts need  a slowdown,  and caremust be taken not to overreact  as it occurs.There are  risks on the  other side as well.  Our forecast  and those of others  haveconsistently  underestimated growth,  as the Chairman  pointed out before.  Labor markets  are tightand are expected to remain so in our forecast and the  Greenbook's.  Personal income is rising,spending is  strong, home buying conditions  are very  favorable,  and confidence  is high.  Businessinvestment  in capital goods and now nonresidential  construction  are reasonably  strong and maybe prompted  by rising wage  costs and  labor scarcity  to remain  so.  A sideways  or declining  stockthe household  side, rising housing values  could sustain  confidence  and  spending.  Finally, creditcontinues  to  be  available, though  spreads have widened  a bit, particularly for anything involvingAsia.6/30-7/1/98So, there  are risks on both sides.  But I continue to see the cost  of being wrong asskewed to the  upside.  I do not think there is much  doubt that  our economy  is operating  at levelsbeyond its potential,  even  though trend productivity  may have increased.  Being wrong at thisstage runs an increasing risk of building in  an inflationary  momentum,  and we may be seeingthat in the  uptick in the  core CPI recently,  especially as it reflects the cost of shelter.  If we  arewrong on the downside  and growth  slows more than is  forecast, the remedy  of easing policy isthere and likely could thwart any move toward recession.  If growth  is stronger, however, the jobto rein in inflation may be tougher, take  longer, and ultimately be more  damaging to the domesticand world economies.

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, the pace of economic  growth in  the Twelfth District hasremained  strong in  recent months,  and some of the  tightness in local labor and housing marketsis  showing through to wages  and consumer prices.  In  Arizona, the fastest growing  state in thenation, job growth  has  been  running at more than  a 4-1/2  percent annual  rate.  Nevada  andWashington  are not far behind with recent employment growth  at a rapid 4 percent pace.Growth has slowed a little in California,  which has been  somewhat more  affected than otherstates by the  drop in  exports to Asia and the pickup in import competition.  The slight slowdownlargely has been  confined to the  state's  manufacturing  sector, and overall  California job growthstill has been solid,  about 3 percent  at an annual rate.  Farther west in Hawaii,  recent economicdevelopments  have been  decidedly  more negative  as  the effects  of reduced  Asian visitorspending have rippled through  that island economy.Although  the  Asian situation  has had disruptive effects  on real  activity in the TwelfthDistrict, consumers  have been  benefiting  at least temporarily  from the related  declines  in prices6/30-7/1/98of imports as  well as the generally  low prices of commodities.  However, we have  seen somerecent  pickup in price increases  for nontraded goods  and services.  Housing markets  are  tight inthe District, and the regional  CPI has  been boosted to a noticeable extent by an acceleration  in itshousing shelter component.  For example, CPI housing  shelter costs in  the San Francisco Bayarea have jumped  about 7 percent relative  to a year earlier, and rents also  are picking up in LosAngeles.  In the Pacific Northwest,  where  a tight labor market has led to a  pickup in wageinflation, consumer prices for services  other than housing also are increasing  at a fast pace.Turning to the  nation,  we continue to see a divergence between  our structural  forecastand the economy's  actual performance.  On  the  one hand, our structural  model  continues topredict slower growth.  Real GDP is projected  to grow  at a  2-1/2  percent rate in  the second  half ofthis year and a less  than 2 percent rate  in  1999.  The huge inventory  buildup in the first quarter isresponsible for much  of the near-term  slowing currently  predicted by the model.  Weaknessabroad  also is  an important reason for the  slower growth.  More  generally, the  forecast  ofdemand is constrained  by the  relatively high level  of the  real  short-term  interest rate.On the  other hand, incoming data continue  to show a stronger-than-expected  economy.Among the prominent recent  examples are the employment  and industrial  production  reports forsubstantial  upside risk to the forecast  that calls for a marked slowing of growth.  Even  in ourforecast of slower  growth, the low  unemployment rate  will continue  to exert upward pressure  onwages.  This pressure  is offset by a number  of factors including  an increase in trend productivitygrowth,  diminished inflation expectations, the  higher dollar, and  increased price competitionfrom abroad.  As  a consequence,  our forecast  shows core CPI staying between  2  and 2-1/2  percentthis  year and next.  But I remain  concerned that if growth does not slow  as predicted,  the effects6/30-7/1/98of even tighter labor markets  will begin  to show through  to  higher wages  and inflationexpectations  and ultimately to higher price inflation.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me  start with a puzzle  I am left withafter listening  to some of the comments  that have just been  made about inventories,  oil,  and theconnection between  oil inventories  and imports.  I may be missing  something.  If the increase  ininventories is basically  composed of imports, whether they are oil or something else, thoseinventories  could not have  contributed to GDP in the first quarter because as  imports they wererecorded  as  a negative.  By the same  reasoning, the projected decline  in inventories  in the currentquarter should not have  a negative effect.  That  strikes me  as something  important that  we needto understand  a little better.  I remember  some huge previous discrepancies in the internationaltrade  accounts when there were statistical  discrepancies  worldwide  on imports and exports.  Itturned  out that exports  from some countries were  counted  as exports but were not yet recorded asimports someplace  else because they were in tankers held up in  the Cayman Islands orelsewhere.  So, we would have to wait a while to figure  it out.  I think that is an issue that wouldbear unraveling before  we draw any  firm conclusions  about how either the trade  account orinventories will  affect GDP in the second quarter and the rest of the year.I have  a comment on the  auto situation.  About 21,000  of the GM-affected workers  arein Ohio.  We have very  large  auto and auto-related  production facilities  in our area, so the strikewill have  a negative impact on manufacturing  activity in our region as long  as it continues.Turning to some regional  anecdotal  reports  since  the last meeting, bankers continue  totell us that commercial loan demand is  very strong, exceeding  their loan budgets  for 1998 asestimated  at the start of the year.  Consumer loan demand  is reported to have weakened  recently6/30-7/1/98compared to earlier in the year, but bankers  say that their consumer loan extensions are  still wellahead of their plans  as set  out at the beginning  of the year.  With respect to real  estate lending,they say that mortgage  financing, which boomed late last  year and early this year, has  cooledmore recently.  But in the usual  reports on their real estate  portfolios, they do raise increasingquestions about the transaction prices  they are seeing on income  property deals.  As before,  weare hearing frequent complaints  from bankers  throughout the District that the Farm  Credit Banksare  very aggressive in  their pricing,  doing some of the things they were  doing back in  the mid-and late  1980s.Construction  spending in the District is heading  for another record.  We have hadmore announcements  of new public buildings,  and this  is a reflection of very strong local  taxreceipts.  Those projects  will carry through  into next  year.  We already  are hearing that not onlywill  1998 construction  spending  and employment  in the construction  sector exceed  1997,  but ourcontacts  expect  1999 to be even stronger  yet.  Following up  on the persistent complaints  ofshortages  of construction  workers, the building trades  unions are now lobbying  Congress  for anincrease  in immigration limits on construction  workers.  In Cincinnati,  we heard that the laborconstruction  industry are developing  plans  to bus in workers  to build the two new  stadiumprojects that have  been  authorized.  When I  asked them from where, they said that they are stillworking on that.  [Laughter]Reports on labor market  conditions  indicate larger  wage structure  increases  thanbefore and more use of retention  bonuses  to address turnover.  Health  care  cost increases,  as wehave heard before,  have  risen  by up to 30 percent.  One firm in the Columbus  area reported thatthey advertised  for two weeks  for unskilled  clerical and  warehouse workers  with starting wages6/30-7/1/98of $7  to  $10  per hour and the advertisements  yielded no applications.  That prompted  anotherbusinessperson  to respond that in their warehouse  distributorship business, they have negotiateda work release  program with the local prison  and  have experienced no  absenteeism so far.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Only breakouts!

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  A communications  company told us that they now feel compelled topass through  steep increases  in labor compensation  costs to their customers  because  they are  nolonger able to meet  such costs through  greater productivity  and efficiency.  We were  told thattourism is booming everywhere,  but  average occupancy  rates  in hotels and  motels in the regionare declining because new  construction is adding to capacity more  rapidly than the rise indemand.Exports to Latin America  and Europe  are reported  to be well ahead of expectationsthis year.  Contacts  report  optimism about markets in both parts of the world because thoseimport-competing  industries  here that see potential  imports from Asia going instead to thoseother regions.  An  exception  has been steel.  We were told that European  steel was  now cominginto  the United States  because Asian steel  is going to  Europe.  Balancing that somewhat, a minesafety appliance  company  said that  sales in Europe  were the best in years,  and they are  optimisticthat will continue  into next year.On  the national economy,  the Greenbook  projects  a soft landing.  Again, I like theGreenbook  forecast;  I only wish I could believe  it.  The soft landing largely  comes from the slackcreated  by falling export  demand and the  leakage  of excess  domestic  demand into the external6/30-7/1/98story implied by the Greenbook  is that without the  Asian crisis, inflation  would be a much  moreserious problem  already  and in  the future.  The  Asian crisis also helps us indirectly by depressingearnings of exporting  and import-competing  firms.  That fosters  less exuberant  equity markets,which  in turn  reduces  the wealth effects that presumably  have  supported the extraordinarydomestic  final demand.  In  a nutshell, I read the  Greenbook analysis as  saying that we  are  goingto get out of the current situation  without accelerating  inflation or a recession  or both.  That willhappen because the Asia  crisis came  along at just the right time and in just the right magnitude.imbalances  in  some  of our markets--assets markets  in particular  and especially  real estate--thatwould eventually  make a  recession  unavoidable.Our challenge is how to keep  this wonderful  economy going not only for the benefit  ofour own people but for that of the rest  of the world.  I  would like  to see and  hear in our Districtmore  caution  being exercised  by both borrowers  and entrepreneurs  on one hand and lenders  andinvestors  on the other side.  But the pattern  of errors that  we have seen  in the  last year inforecasting  money and  credit growth and nominal  spending  growth has  gone on  for too long.  Ifeel  very certain  that if a year ago  we had  looked at a forecast  that accurately  predicted whatactually has happened in  the economy in  the last four quarters,  we would have  been  moreinclined to think that some  precautionary firming was appropriate.  Even if the Greenbook isright about the economy  and the Bluebook is right  about money growth, two years from now weare  going to be looking at a current  account  deficit of $400 billion,  a direct reflection  ofexcessive domestic  demand in the  sense of much more rapid growth  in demand than  aggregatesupply.  We know  that pattern is unsustainable  and  it also  should be unacceptable.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  The economy of the  Philadelphia District continues to operate  at highlevels, but the rate of increase appears  to  be slowing.  The labor market  in the District reflectsthis situation  with a  low unemployment  rate and  slowing job  growth,  and there continues  to belittle upward pressure  on prices.  Home sales have  been doing  very well in recent months.  Landprices have been  rising, but builders have had trouble passing through these increases.  Buyersare shopping a lot and they are pressing  builders for lower prices.  When there  have been  priceincreases,  they generally  have been modest.  National builders have  made competition evenmore fierce for local  builders and, as  a consequence,  builders  have had to be more efficient tomaintain  reasonable  margins.  Despite widespread  indications of high levels  of demand,producers  continue  to have  little ability to raise prices,  and this phenomenon  is still widespreadin the District whether in construction,  retailing, or manufacturing.Turning to the national  economy, the  basic story in the Greenbook  of moderatinggrowth  and modest  inflationary pressures  in the context of a lot of uncertainty  strikes  me  asbeing reasonable.  The  only part of that forecast that I have  a good deal  of confidence  in is the"lot  of uncertainty" part.  I have the  sense that what we  see as the most likely outcome is lesslikely than earlier  and that both upside  and downside risks have  increased in  recent weeks.  Wehave little practical  choice but to be patient and alert in this environment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Our District has been expanding at amoderate pace in recent  weeks,  maybe a little more slowly than earlier in  the year mainlybecause of a deceleration  in  manufacturing  activity,  notably  in the chemical  and paper industries,which  are important in  our region.  Anecdotally,  manufacturers  currently  are more  pessimistic intheir comments  to us  about the longer-term impact  of the  Asian crisis on their markets than they6/30-7/1/98were  at the time of the last Committee  meeting.  Elsewhere,  we  have had some impact from theGM strike, mainly in  Maryland.  For example,  a van  assembly plant in Baltimore had to shutdown because it could not get component parts from GM facilities  that had shut down  inMichigan.  About 2,700 people  were laid off in  that instance, and there have been  smallerlayoffs  at a number of companies  that supply GM.  So, manufacturing  is currently  on the  softside of our regional  picture.  Outside  the manufacturing  sector, business conditions  still  lookquite strong.  If anything,  consumer demand may be  strengthening  further.  Automobile andtruck sales  have been  quite robust recently,  and we also  have seen  good demand for furniture  andappliances, presumably  because of the continued strength in housing activity.Finally on the District,  I have been struck  by the frequency  of comments we  get fromour directors  and other business contacts  regarding  the extraordinary  amount  of money that islooking for a home.  Potential  investors, including  notably REITS,  are competing veryaggressively  for deals.  In this kind of environment,  there is  a lot of concern  on the part ofbankers  in the District and other observers  that credit  standards  may be slipping and  we may bedigging a hole for ourselves.  That is it for my District.I have a little  anecdotal information  on the Kansas City District.  I have a son whorecently went out to Albuquerque.  He doesn't know  anybody out there.  He had been there  abouttwo weeks,  and he  got  a job with benefits!  [Laughter]  I  don't have  to pay his health insuranceanymore.  So, as far as I  am concerned,  the Albuquerque  economy  is in really great  shape.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  It has the highest unemployment  level.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Well, my son has  dropped it down  a little.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Did he get  a signing bonus?6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  He did not get a signing bonus.  But incidentally I should tell youthat the job he  got was recruiting  high-tech  workers.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Does he know  anything  about that subject?

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I hope he  does by now; he has been working  for them for a coupleof days.  [Laughter]With respect to the national  economy, real GDP growth may indeed have slowed to a1-1/2  percent rate, the  figure  you gave us earlier, Mike,  with inventory  accumulation  slowing fromthe  rapid pace in the first quarter and net exports continuing to deteriorate.  But it seems to me,and I guess I'm just repeating  some things that others have  said, that these two negative  impulseson real  GDP growth clearly  should be temporary.  With that in mind, it is hard for me to see whythe negative  effects  of these  two  factors  would be powerful enough to reduce the growth  of realfinal domestic  purchases  by 3 percentage  points in the  second half of 1998  and by roughly  anadditional  percentage point next year as projected,  holding the  average  growth in real  GDPbelow  2 percent for the next six consecutive  quarters.  The labor  markets  are  still extraordinarilytight, and the Greenbook  is projecting  only a small reduction in the growth  of employment  in thenear term.  That implies continued  solid growth in real  wages and real income,  supportingconsumption.  Investment, it seems to me, ought to remain reasonably  strong, given continuingfavorable  financial conditions  and a lot of opportunities  to increase  both productivity  and sales.From this perspective,  it seems quite plausible to  me that the  growth  of final purchases  willcontinue to offset  the negative effects  coming from the inventory  correction  and weaker netexports.  Indeed,  if these negative effects  dissipate,  it seems to me that demand could actuallystrengthen a little in the quarters  ahead.  With these  points in mind and with the core  CPI on a6/30-7/1/98consistently  measured basis  projected to drift up, I come  out in the opposite position  from BobMcTeer.  I think there is  still  a lot of upside risk in the  outlook and we  need to give it weight.Having  said all of this, Mike  Prell  and his  staff might be forgiven  for wondering  whywe submitted projections  that are  very, very  close to the Greenbook.  The  answer is that theappropriate  monetary policy we  assumed, following the instructions,  raises the  federal funds rateabout  3/4  percentage  point  over the next several  months.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Apart from the GM strike, conditions  inthe  Seventh District generally  are quite similar to what  I reported  at the last  several meetings.Our region is experiencing  continued moderate  expansion  and  very tight labor markets, withoccasional  signs of wage  increases  but very few indications  that price  inflation is accelerating.Like  last year at this time, championship performances  by both  the Chicago Bulls and the DetroitRed Wings have boosted local  economies.  Labor shortages  continue to be the main concern  ofvirtually all businesses in  the District.  The unemployment  rate for our five  states dropped  /2percentage  point in April  to an average  of 3.3  percent  and remained near that level in May.  Oneof our directors,  who for months reported that his  large national  retailing firm had not had toraise wages  to get workers,  has for the  first time reported labor shortages  and higher labor costs.I noted last time that consumer  price inflation in  the Midwest  had accelerated  ahead of that forthe nation, and that continues to be the case, with prices for services  being the  driving factor.While  the District economy  continues  to perform  very  well,  there are a few  signs  thatactivity may be  slowing.  The Chicago Purchasing Managers'  survey results  released  thismorning showed a  slower rate  of expansion  in June,  with virtually all of the  components  lowerthan in May.  Part of that  may be due to Asia.  Anecdotal  reports of any serious  adverse  Asian6/30-7/1/98impact have  been largely limited to  the high-tech  electronics  and electronics  componentsindustry.  However, we have heard that Asia may be  the reason for slowing in  the temporaryhelp industry. While  overall business was quite  strong in the paper industry, exports  were downsharply.  In  general,  retailers  noted that there has been  some slowing  in sales activity in  Junefrom the  torrid pace of April  and May.  A large producer of agricultural equipment has reducedproduction  for the first time in four years.  The firm anticipates slower sales  because of largercarryover stocks  in agricultural  commodities,  lower farm  incomes, and weather problems inagricultural  areas.  Bob McTeer mentioned drought.  We have had floods  in Iowa; maybe  we canship some water down to Texas  to help  them  out!The biggest news, of course,  is the GM  strike, which is constraining our region'seconomy relatively more  than the nation's.  Over 50 percent  of GM's laid-off workers  at U.S.assembly  and parts plants  are  in the Seventh  District.  Retail sales in  Michigan  and othercommunities  having a sizable  GM presence  are  showing more softness than elsewhere.  Autodealers in the District are  concerned  about shortages  of vehicles  as well  as parts,  which couldaffect their service  business.  A survey by our Detroit branch found that spending by businessfirms in the Flint area has  been particularly  affected.In terms of the strike's impact  on the  national economy,  we are in broad  agreementwith the Board staff that the strike will  reduce real GDP growth  about 1/2 percentage  point in thesecond quarter.  Much  of that effect will  show up as  a reduction in inventories,  as  June's  lightvehicle  sales probably  will be in the mid-15  million unit annual  rate range.  That would be astrong  performance  though  not as  robust as  in May.  Some  of the strike's  lost output will,  ofcourse,  be  made up the  second half of the year, but the  key point is to recognize  a strike for what6/30-7/1/98it is so far, namely  a temporary  adverse  supply shock with temporary  negative consequences  forboth output and prices.Turning  to the national  outlook, the incoming data of the last few  weeks  haveconfirmed  the underlying  strength  of domestic demand.  So far, we see  little evidence of slowingin  consumption  and fixed  investment, and labor markets  are still very tight.  As  at the previousmeeting,  our forecast of slowing growth hinges on  substantial  declines in inventory investmentand deterioration  in net exports in the near term.  Certainly, the April business  inventory datashow some slowdown  in accumulation  relative to the first quarter, but we still may see highergrowth in stocks  than the Greenbook  projects.  Although  we are somewhat more optimistic onnet exports  than the Greenbook,  we recognize  that the risks  here are great.My recent trip to Japan  only confirmed my growing pessimism over the  prospects  forthe quick and significant structural  reforms  needed to improve their economy.  It was painfullyreminiscent  of my days as a  trade negotiator back in  the early  1990s.  All told despite theseconsiderations,  we think that real  GDP growth  is likely to exceed 3  percent,  and we forecast1999 growth  at or slightly above trend.  We  are less optimistic  about future inflation  than theGreenbook.  The slight recent deterioration  in CPI inflation  may not be alarming,  but as thespecial factors  holding down goods  price inflation  wane, we may see  overall inflation  movinghigher as  the  gap between services  and  goods  price inflation  closes.In my judgment, the risks we face have  increased  on both the upside  and the downsidesince our last meeting.  Domestic demand  has not  slowed appreciably,  and wage and price  datashow some deterioration.  On the other hand, the situation  in Asia and  in Japan  in particularseems to be more  serious than just a few  weeks  ago.  On balance,  despite my increased  concernsregarding Asia, I  believe the risks we  face remain  on the upside.6/30-7/1/98

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  Sixth District economy is  stilloperating at a high level,  but recent  growth  appears  to have  been  slightly slower than that Ireported at the last FOMC meeting.  Retail  sales have  posted only modest gains  above those  of ayear ago, while  the stories on manufacturing  are mixed, with strong reports from some  areas andproblems  from others.  For example, layoffs at Motorola are  expected to have an  impact onemployment  in Huntsville, Alabama and  at two plants in Florida, and prospects  are  gloomy at aNissan  auto assembly plant in Tennessee.  The GM strike has already idled 5,000 autoworkersacross  our District,  and a report last week fromwas very pessimistic  about the likelihood  of aprompt settlement.  Building on what Cathy Minehan  said, other signs  of labor activism areshowing up: negotiations  are  going on at Bell  South, where wages  are  a very  big issue,  and atLucent Technologies,  where  benefits  and job security  are highest on the list of issues.Housing activity continues  at a strong pace  in the District, with single-family homeconstruction  and sales being the strongest.  The only area of softness is in Louisiana.  One signof how strongly the tourism industry in the District  is affecting housing markets  is illustrated bya report  from one of our directors  at a recent  meeting.  He  indicated that entire  single-familyhome developments are  being built  in Florida  and sold with  the idea that the homes  will berented for a week  or month or more to tourists.  Office markets remain  healthy  while multifamilyconstruction,  which  we thought had peaked, now  appears not to have  done  so and is  certainlydoing better than we expected.  Nevertheless,  with the exception  of Orlando,  we continue  tobelieve that most of the big cities in the District are  on the verge of being overbuilt.  At the  lastmeeting, I indicated that the torrid pace of tourism, one  of our region's major engines  of growth,6/30-7/1/98had slowed a bit.  But as new attractions  have come on line in Orlando,  we have seen  somerebound in tourism.On the  wage  and price  front, the stories seem to be much the same.  Unusually largewage increases  remain  tightly targeted on just those  fields where  scarce skills are in  highdemand, and firms  are continuing  to report a determination  to resist raising prices.  With laborbonuses, retention  bonuses, and other one-time  compensation  increases.  Like others,  I amhearing increasing  talk of companies  adding benefits.  Small  companies are  addinghospitalization;  large and small companies  are  adding childcare  benefits.  It is not clear to me towhat extent those nonwage  benefits may have found their way into  the traditional  measure ofoverall compensation  costs.Not to be outdone,  I have brought  along with me a  copy of an Atlanta newspaper  fromlast week that tells my favorite  tight labor market story  for June.  It was reported that  a smallhigh-tech firm in suburban  Atlanta had just leased  a BMW for every  one of its 40 employees,from the receptionist to the programmers,  as an added  inducement for people to stay with thecompany.  It is reported  that they are  even paying for the auto insurance  to go with  the BMW.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  How long is the lease?

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  I'm not sure.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  As long as  they stay!

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  As long  as they stay.  On the national  front, like  others, I see  aneconomy that is divided into two very divergent  sectors:  the international  sector, which  islooking weaker  and  weaker, and a strong domestic  economy, where  growth was paced in the firstquarter by robust gains  in consumer  spending, business  investment,  and inventory  expansion.  It6/30-7/1/98seems to me that there is little one can  do directly with monetary policy to  affect the internationalsector.  After taking  account  of the damping  effect it is having  on overall domestic  real growth,  Iwould argue that we should not allow  international  developments  to divert  attention  unduly  awayfrom any developing  imbalances  in the  domestic  economy.  Fortunately,  I don't believe that  ishappening,  at least not yet.  To be sure,  consumer spending continues to pace the domesticeconomy.  Last Friday's spending  and income numbers continue  to suggest that the consumer  isnot yet spending beyond his means.  Consumer debt burdens remain somewhat high,  as dobankruptcies,  but appear to be  manageable  so far.  Corporate  profits remain  strong, increasingbut at a decreasing  rate.  Whether this  will  damp investment  and whether the recent buildup ininventories  is planned or unanticipated continue  to be  key questions in my mind.Our forecast  for the next two years is similar to that in the Greenbook  and to manyother forecasts.  Like the  Greenbook, though with some difference  in composition,  we see someslowing in coming quarters  due primarily to a slackening  in investment spending  and a pullbackin inventory spending.  We  see consumer expenditures  remaining strong.  We  anticipate  thatinflationary pressures  will  be modest over the forecast period, with the expected pickup ininflation being due primarily to an unwinding of the favorable effects that recent  declines  inenergy prices  have had on  prices rather than a surge  in underlying  inflationary  pressures.  To besure, the risks  to this  forecast, as others have said, are different  depending  on whether  one looksat the domestic  or the international  components.  Clearly,  as Peter Fisher has  laid out and othershave commented, problems  in Japan  and elsewhere  in Asia could worsen significantly  and theripple effects  could be  quite alarming.  However, I think the risks to the domestic  economyremain  on the  upside.  In my view,  it would be premature  to take  down the caution  flag in  that6/30-7/1/98area quite  yet.  We have  continually  been surprised by the  strength in investment  and consumerspending, and those patterns could well continue for some time.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The regional economy  continues to do  verywell:  consumer spending is  strong, construction activity  is strong, and business  attitudes aregenerally upbeat.  The only exception  to those favorable patterns  is in the natural  resourceindustries--agriculture,  energy,  and paper--where  conditions are  clearly a good deal  lessfavorable  and there are  some concerns.Our labor markets  remain  very tight.  The unemployment  rate in the Twin  Citiesmetropolitan area  has now dropped to  1.7 percent.  This has led to some  acceleration  in the rateof wage increases  but it's spotty.  It's by no means  generalized.  As a  consequence  of discussionswe have  had with a  variety of business and labor people,  one  development that  seems to haverestrained  at least overt  wage increases  is a greater emphasis  on  what  people are callingquality-of-life issues.  That is, labor is increasingly  interested,  at least in our area, in  things likemore flexible  hours, more  flexible vacation time, relaxed  dress codes,  and  so forth.  Employersseem willing to trade those  kinds of things for what we think of as  traditional compensationincreases.  Whether those always  lead to cost increases  or not depends,  of course, on whathappens to productivity.  There,  we do not have  very good statistics,  although business  people  doreport what they consider to be very favorable  results  in terms of the application  of technologyand their ability to raise  productivity.  So, that seems to be ongoing, at least in  our part of theworld.All this is hardly news at this point, but I do think productivity  is one of the  keys  to theeconomic  outlook  and will be  a principal  determinant of how the  economy plays  out.  I tend to6/30-7/1/98be relatively  optimistic in that respect.  I think something like the Greenbook  forecast is certainlypossible,  although  my own view is that we will get more real  growth both this year and next thanin the Greenbook  forecast.  I believe domestic  aggregate  demand will continue to expandsubstantially.  I expect aggregate  supply to benefit  from the productivity  improvement  that weare seeing,  but I also think we probably will see more inflation next  year than is  anticipated inthe Greenbook.  My view  is not based so much  on a conviction  that more  inflation  is inevitablebut simply on the notion  that I would not want  to bet the whole ranch  at this point on sustainedproductivity improvement  above and beyond what the trend might be.  So, I  am a little cautiouswhen it comes to that.As far as Asia is concerned, we  obviously don't know how  much of an adverse effectdevelopments  there might ultimately have on the U.S.  economy.  Even if we did know,  I thinkwe would have  a  good deal of difficulty unraveling  the implications  and ramifications  for oureconomy.  My own  guesstimate  is that we should not exaggerate  the effects of Asia.  The reasonis,  as we have  seen repeatedly  over the years,  that our economy is  very resilient.  We have  seenmajor domestic  disruptions  to various regions  of our economy from time to time--I'm thinkingboth  of the East Coast and the West Coast--and  yet  overall activity continues to march  aheadrather nicely.

MR.  HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since we had  a very  fine report on theTenth District earlier,  I will keep  my comments  relatively brief.  [Laughter]  I will say, though,that the District economy remains  strong.  Our directors and business  contacts  report signs  of thisstrength everywhere.  Consumer spending  is brisk, manufacturing  is solid,  and housing sales andstarts are  robust.  Labor markets  generally  remain tight across the District.6/30-7/1/98There have been  some significant  developments  in the ag markets recently,  and Ithought I would touch on that for a few  minutes.  Overall,  the agricultural  situation is  weakeningas farm  prices continue  to sag.  The District's important wheat harvest is well under way  and alarge crop is expected,  although  about  10 percent smaller than the bumper crop that we had lastyear.  In addition, recently  planted spring crops are  well established and  are enjoying  excellentgrowing  conditions.  Damping the  farm outlook, however,  are  low farm  prices.  Wheat, soybean,and  pork prices  are running more  than 25 percent  below  levels of a  year ago.  Corn prices  aredown about  12 percent.  Part of the problem  stems from the drop in demand from Asia. Wheatexports  to Asia have  been  especially weak, contributing  to the low hog and cattle prices andwidespread  losses in the  first half of this year.  The weakness  also results  from prospects  forlarge supplies  of both crops and  livestock this year.  If weather patterns  are normal  this summer,crop  inventories will  build for the  second straight year.  If these low prices persist as the futuresour District where  livestock is more important,  farm income could  drop as much  as  10 percent.In real terms, farm incomes  are sliding to near the lowest  levels in this decade.Lower farm incomes  will,  I believe, lead to some  rise in farm  loan problems  this year.However, most banks  had strong portfolios  coming into the year  and should be able  to absorblikely increases  in delinquencies.  Moreover,  rising farmland  values  and  strong cash rentscontinue to  indicate  that many farmers  still have  strong balance  sheets.  On  a more positive  note,of course, the  weak farm prices  will moderate  any upward  pressures  on food prices.On the national  front, I think private  domestic demand  is fundamentally  strong.  Eventhough domestic demand  growth may slow  over the forecast horizon, I believe that it will remainat or even  above the long-run trend.  The first-quarter  revision suggests  that the economy carried6/30-7/1/98over more momentum  than previously estimated, and so far the second-quarter consumption  datasupport that view.  Even  though the expansion  should slow this year due to the expectedinventory  correction and the worsening  of the  trade deficit,  I think the  slowing  will not keep realGDP from  growing above  the long-run  trend.  I recognize that inventories  and the decline  in netexports  are a  significant risk to the expansion.Recent  developments  on the inflation  front have caused me to revise upward myinflation  expectations  for the year.  The increase  in core inflation  we have seen  so far this  year islarger month-over-month  than I had anticipated.  I also expect inflation  to increase further nextyear, perhaps  as  past favorable  inflation factors unwind.  While  I remain reluctant to draw  strongimplications  for inflation  from the labor markets, I don't think we can  ignore the upwardmovement in  wage gains arising from  very tight labor markets.  In  addition, we are  seeing  adivergence  between  growth  in domestic demand  and growth in  GDP.  To the extent anaccommodative  monetary  policy may be  generating the  strong domestic  demand, I think weshould worry a little  about inflationary  consequences.Finally, the continued  strong  growth in  the monetary aggregates,  M2 and M3,  suggeststo me that monetary conditions  have become  more  accommodative.  Having  said this, I amaware that favorable offsetting factors continue to exert moderating  influences.  Pipelinepressures  are  small; capacity utilization  has been declining;  and the dollar, of course,  is and hasbeen  appreciating.  In addition, the historically high  real  federal  funds rate  appears to beconsistent with a slower expansion.I weigh all this and balance  it out as follows:  The expansion recently has shown  signsof slowing  to a more moderate pace,  but I expect it to continue  growing  above its long-run  trendfor at least the  foreseeable  future.  Also, as temporary  favorable  factors unwind,  I think inflation6/30-7/1/98is  likely to pick up later this year.  I see evidence  accumulating to suggest that monetary  policyhas become  more accommodative.  As a  result, there  is a risk that inflation will rise more thanwhat I would be comfortable with.  However,  I recognize  that the data relating  to the  extent ofthis  risk remain  mixed, and I  also am aware  of the unfolding events in Asia.  So, I look forwardto our policy discussion  tomorrow.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The SecondDistrict economy has been quite  strong in the second  quarter.  Our manufacturing  sector, whichis concentrated  in  the northern  half of New Jersey  and upstate  New York, actually began  to lookup a bit until the General  Motors strike came  along.  GM  has laid  off about 5,400 workers  of the10,000 located in Buffalo, some  more at a  parts plant in Rochester,  and about  2,300 in northernNew Jersey.  That  has set manufacturing  back a bit.  Although  New York City still  has anunemployment  rate of over 7 percent,  that rate  is down  from over 10 percent  8 or 9 months  ago,and the city seems  to be on the way  to adding more new jobs this  calendar year than in any  yearsince the  1960s.  So, the city continues  to do rather well.As  I look at the national  and international  economies,  the word that comes to my mindis "uncertainty."  I think that the forecast, as presented  in the excellent  staff Chart Show, is  aperfectly reasonable  one  and one that I sincerely hope  will materialize,  especially  theinternational  aspect  of it.  However, the  downside risk  on the  international  side is veryconsiderable in  my view.  The situation  in Japan  impresses  me as one in which  the economicdata do not tell us the nature of the crisis.  What we are  dealing  with in  the second  largesteconomy of the world is a very  deep cultural crisis in  which the decisionmaking  process of thesociety, which  had served Japan  very well  since the Meiji Restoration  and especially  since the6/30-7/1/98Second World War, has broken  down.  The  decision  recommenders  and to a large degree  thepolicymakers  have been  in the bureaucracy,  which is now completely  discredited  and even  morecompletely  dispirited.During  our recent  trip to Japan Deputy Treasury Secretary Summers  and I found thatleadership  for the Japanese  nation would now have  to come from the largest political  party, theLDP.  This is  a rather  significant shift in the way that society is run,  and one has to hope that theshift will work well.  In  my view,  the  emerging  decisionmakers  in the LDP probably have  awindow of opportunity  of about  two to three months in which  to convince  the party  members  andother political  decisionmakers  to take some  very  difficult steps as regards  the restructuring of theJapanese  economy, especially  the  financial  sector.  There is  a real  question concerning  whetherthey will  be  able to do that.If they do not--that is,  if the Japanese people continue  to have  very  low confidence  atboth the consumer and business  levels  and if that doesn't turn  around in the next two to threemonths--I  think that Japan will  sink into  a deeper recession.  That inevitably  will  cause a muchmore  serious  crisis elsewhere  in Asia, largely because the  situation  in Japan would  add to thecrisis of confidence in  an area where confidence is  already  abysmally low.  It  is very difficult toimagine that the effects  would not spread  to the key countries in Latin America.  We  have  seenthat even  Chile has become  vulnerable and has had to change  policies of very  long standing,which  they thought  had served them very well.  We have  a crisis  that is at  an advanced  stage  inRussia,  and it could readily  spread to Russia's neighbors.  Turkey is always an  accident  thatcould  easily happen. In my  view that  sort of international  financial crisis  would not be limitedto an Asian  trade effect of, say,  1/2  or  3/4 or  1 percent  on U. S. economic  growth,  because it is very6/30-7/1/98difficult to  imagine that that  would not spill over into our financial  markets  and create a ratherlarge correction.Looking at the purely domestic  economy, if the crisis  that I believe  could emanatefrom Japan does  occur, the downside risk to  our real economy will be very considerable.  If onthe other hand a crisis in Japan  does not happen,  the  other great uncertainty  is whether  we willcontinue to have the kind of productivity  growth that  is projected in the Greenbook.  Lowerproductivity  growth could reduce the rise in  real output to below  the Greenbook forecast  andraise  inflation to a rate  above that  in the Greenbook  and certainly as  high  as  that in  my ownBank's inflation  forecast.  Our forecast, which  appears  to be rather similar to a number offorecasts  reported around the table,  has inflation  rising to  about 3  percent next year.  We simplydon't know whether productivity  will  continue to "finance"  more rapid economic  growth  withvery  low inflation.  We have  been experiencing  very nice productivity  improvement since  thelast quarter of 1995,  and even  a nonbeliever in  the new paradigm like  me eventually  has tobecome  convinced,  if it goes on long  enough, that there really  is something new here.Now,  it seems to me  that if we have  this massive  uncertainty  on  the international  sideand very considerable  uncertainty  on the  domestic  side and we  have monetary policy close towhere we want it to be in any event, there is a  very, very  strong  case that the watchful  waitingthat has  served  this Committee  so extraordinarily  well over the last  several  years is the  rightpolicy to continue.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  As opposed to unwatchful  waiting not being the right policy!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole, no double negatives,  please![Laughter]6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I will try not to double anything.  Since our last meeting, there has beenno significant  change in Eighth  District economic conditions.  We continue  to have exactly thesame kind of stories about  tight labor markets  and firms  with unfilled positions.  We don't  seeany great upward pressure on product prices.  We do have some disruptions  from the GM strike,as is  true in  a number of other Districts.  It  looks as if we're  going to have  an Anheuser-Buschstrike, but perhaps  given the uncompleted  stadium in Texas--

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  That  is really serious!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  It's the only thing that is giving Mike  Prell reason to pause.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I don't drink beer!  I am wondering  how the record will look in fiveyears.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I am told that the management  of Anheuser intends to keep the breweryoperating,  so I guess it will become the  largest  microbrewery  in the  United States.District housing markets remain very strong.  In  most markets, we  have seen houseprice increases  in the 5 to  10 percent  range over the last year.  Prices  in the  St. Louis market  rose14 percent in the last  12  months according  to the data I'm looking at,  suggesting that I boughtmy house just in  time back  in early  April.I would like to  talk about the national  outlook and the puzzle  in the businessinvestment area.  If one thinks about firms that are  growing over time and expanding  capacity,one would expect them to be  adding capital  and labor and not ending  up with excess capacity  ineither area.  If we look at  the capacity  utilization numbers,  it would appear that conditions  arequite comfortable,  and yet  all around the country  we hear stories of labor shortages,  firms  withunfilled  positions,  and an increasing  amount of turnover.  So, there  seems to be something of amismatch  between  the capital  and the  labor sides.  That could come  about because firms  have6/30-7/1/98made some miscalculations,  but I'm guessing that the investment outlook will remain strongbecause firms in this situation  are  going to be substituting capital  for the labor that they cannothire.  We have  an example  in Louisville.  UPS  is going to be  adding  a huge facility,  aninvestment of over $800 million, to automate  the package sorting that they do every night  andreduce  the large  amount of hand labor in that operation.  That is  a very large investment.  I hopeit works  better than the baggage  handling system  at the Denver airport, which also wasautomated, but I guess  the Denver airport eventually straightened  that problem out.  Given thepersisting stories that we hear about the  shortages  of labor, we probably will  continue to  seestrong investment.  With  the  capacity utilization numbers that we are  looking at reflecting  capitalthat is not in tune with the available  labor or some maldistribution  by industry  or otherwise,  weshould not be lured too readily into  a comfortable outlook on investment just because  thecapacity utilization  numbers  look lower than they have  at times in  the past.I continue  to believe  that with an  unchanged  federal  funds rate, the inflation risks aresubstantially greater on  the upside  of the Greenbook  forecast than on the downside.  I have notchanged  my views  at all, so I will not repeat them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  The most important  developments since  the last meeting  relate tonear-term  growth.  They include  early signs  of the projected slowing in  inventory  investment, theGM  strike, and the further deterioration  in foreign real  economic  activity centered in  Asia andJapan  that is threatening  to spread elsewhere.  The combined effects of these developments,reflected in the significant declines  in both inventory investment and net exports  in theGreenbook forecast,  point convincingly to a  sharper than previously expected  slowdown  in thesecond  quarter--from well  above  to likely below  trend  growth.  This, of course,  follows robust6/30-7/1/98growth  in  the first quarter and indeed for the  last year and a  half.  While  this is history, it has lefta legacy  in terms of the prevailing very  tight labor market that is the major source  of inflationrisk going  forward.  This risk will remain even  if growth slows  immediately to trend.The significant deterioration  in the foreign  economic  outlook is  the most importantchange in the forecast since the May  meeting.  In thinking about the effect of the  Asian crisis onthe outlook, I like to keep  in mind both the central  tendency  in forecasts  of the spillover  on theU.S.  economy and the  probability distribution  associated with this effect.  In my view,  the centraltendency  was relatively stable earlier in the year while the probability  of a  significantly  worseoutcome  appeared to diminish  when some rebound  occurred in the currency  and equity marketsof the countries  in question.  More recently, however,  there has been both a  worsening  in thecentral tendency  and a renewal  of a higher probability of a significantly  worse outcome.  Theaggravation  of the central  tendency reinforces  the  case for a significant  slowing in the pace of theeconomic  expansion  going forward,  while  the  widening  of the tail  associated  with worse casescenarios  adds  an important  downside risk to  the forecast.  The  list of countries  facing seriousdifficulties  seems to grow  by the day.Nevertheless,  the  growth  of domestic final  demand remains robust.  The  strengthreflects positive  fundamentals,  including continued  supportive  financial  market conditions.  Thisleaves  some  serious doubt  about whether the  slowdown  that clearly appears  to be  under way willleave growth  persistently below  trend, a consideration  that is central  to the  optimistic  inflationscenario  in  the Greenbook.  While  I expect  slower growth  and higher inflation  going forward,still in  question  is the degree  to which  this turns out to be  a relatively  benign outcome--specifically,  a reverse  soft landing with inflation  remaining modest--or a  less pleasant ending of6/30-7/1/98one form or another.  There is once again a more balanced  set of risks  in terms of output  growth,given the sorry state  of foreign  economic  developments  and the still  robust domestic  demand.On balance,  I expect somewhat faster  growth  and higher inflation than projected  in theGreenbook.  Like President Broaddus,  I believe that an outcome  in line with  the Greenbookforecast  would require some  tightening of monetary policy over the forecast horizon.  On thegrowth  side, I wonder whether  we are facing  only  a transitory decline in growth  to below  trend inthe second quarter, after which growth  will rebound  to at  least trend or higher.  I wonder,  inparticular,  if growth  will  remain as subdued  as projected  in  the Greenbook  for the second halfwhen auto  production rebounds  from  the GM  strike and as the drag from nonauto  inventoryinvestment and net exports  diminishes.If growth slows to trend or remains  above  trend, the unemployment  rate  will remainnear where it is today or drift still  lower and the inflation outlook will  deteriorate  more rapidlythan in the staff forecast.  Even if growth  slows as projected  in the Greenbook, I wonder whetherthe staff was  too optimistic  in its jump-off from third-quarter  core  CPI inflation.  I interpreted therebound  in the  underlying rate of core  inflation from  near 2 percent  to about  2-1/2 percent.  Butafter a 2.7 percent  annual rate of core  inflation  over the first five  months  of this year, theGreenbook projects  only  a 2.1  percent rate for the second half.  I would be less concerned  aboutthe outlook for inflation  if the staff turns  out to be on the  mark about where the underlying  rateof inflation is today.  That jump-off point, the higher productivity  trend produced in the lastGreenbook  about which I  am also  skeptical,  and the 0.3  percentage  point downward revision  inthe CPI inflation  in  1999  due to technical  revisions  combine to yield the Greenbook's  still low2-1/4  percent  core CPI inflation for  1999.6/30-7/1/98Finally, I  am concerned  that when the trend in  the dollar  reverses, it will be moredramatic than the  staff projects.  When the  fundamentals in  terms of relative  cyclical  growthrates  and real  interest rate differentials  tilt against  the dollar, I expect the surging  current accountdeficit to reinforce  the decline in the dollar, potentially yielding a much sharper reversal  of theexchange  rate than is projected in the Greenbook.  That  would add to the inflation  rebound in1999  and beyond.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  Like many around the table, I find the Greenbook  forecast veryappealing.  It would be nice if it were right!  I think that  if the forecast turned out to be right, wewould find ourselves  in a situation that is extremely  interesting,  unusual,  and uncertain but notdifficult.  By that  I mean the  soft landing would get  us out of the difficult  choice  between  ourdomestic  responsibilities  and our international  ones.We have  had so much good news  over the last year or so that it is nice  to think thatgood news is normal.  The domestic  economy has certainly been  performing  extremely well  byeven the most demanding  standards.  Growth  has been  very strong and well balanced.  Laborwould have  thought possible.  Wages  have  been rising but not yet  at an alarming pace,  and priceshave  been  astonishingly well behaved so  far.  Capacity has  increased  and whatever we thinkabout  the permanence  or impermanence  of the productivity increase,  it certainly has been  therewhen we needed it to help keep wage  increases  from pushing either prices up or profits  down.The pace of growth  last  year and the acceleration  in the first quarter of this year were clearlyunsustainable  by anybody's  measures.  There is  no way we could keep  adding to payrolls  at that6/30-7/1/98rate  without running out of workers  and ending up with  the proverbial  bottlenecks that  have beenso  amazingly  absent from the current  boom.Without an impending  slowdown,  we clearly  would be tempted or required  by anyserious  economic  analysis to  use the  only tool we  have to  slow the expansion  down.  But we  aresaved by a forecast that  shows the  growth rate dropping like a rock under the combined  impactof inventory retrenchment  and the  worsening Asian crisis.  So, we have  to  hope that theGreenbook is right or at least roughly right and that the slowdown  will occur or indeed hasalready occurred.  I certainly agree that the evidence  points to slowing, but I am  skeptical  aboutthe break being as  sharp  as the staff believes.  My guess is that we will  be back in August with  adomestic  economy that is running a bit faster than we think it sustainably can  and with moresigns of domestic  inflation.  I am not too worried about that because  I think the  dollar also  islikely to  stay strong and that the anti-inflationary  inertia is currently  a very potent force.  By thatI mean  that the low inflation expectations  and the  pervasive belief of the  business communitythat they have no  pricing power because market conditions are  so competitive  are  keepinginflation  in check.If the forecast  is substantially  wrong  and growth does not slow much,  then we reallyhave  a difficult problem.  The problem  arises primarily  because  in some respects  at least we  arenot just the central bank of the United States.  We  are  an institution with  world responsibilities,whether we like it or not.  If by August or sooner,  it is obvious  that the U.S.  economy iscontinuing to run hot, then we have  a serious  dilemma, especially if the world outlook is asprecarious or even more  precarious than it looks now.  We  can tell ourselves that the best thingto do for the world as well  as  for ourselves is to keep the U.S.  economy growing  on a sustainabletrack, and therefore we better  slow it down by raising rates.  But we  would then be  taking the6/30-7/1/98risk of making the  world situation  even  less tenable and perhaps  precipitating  another round ofcompetitive currency  devaluations  that could lead  to a  prolonged global  depression.  That is notan attractive  set of choices,  so we  had better hope that the Greenbook forecast  is right.Of course, there  is also the possibility raised by  several around the table that theGreenbook  is wrong in the other direction.  The  sharp slowing could cut investor and  consumerconfidence.  The  stock market could turn  to rational  nonexuberance  and we would be  faced witha soft economy and rising unemployment.  That would be  unfortunate  but not particularly  hard tomanage  from a  policy point of view.  The  world would be  quite happy with our cutting interestrates.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Gramlich.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  At one  level it might seem that thismeeting  is more  of the same, but as our earlier discussions have  brought  out, there have beensubtle  differences  on  the policy question  since  this expansion has  proceeded.  Beginning  with thedomestic  economy,  the  first quarter was unsustainably  rapid by almost anyone's  definition.  Butbecause  of the inventory  swing, the damping  influence  of the  stock market, and net exports,  Iguess  I'm in agreement  with the Greenbook that growth  is slowing  on its own to roughly  asustainable  path.  One could argue  that policy  should tighten  some to help this process  along, butI suppose I  am more comfortable  with the  view that policy should  sit still and let the slowdownoccur naturally,  especially in view  of the surprisingly  good performance  of inflation.Turning  to the international  economy,  others have  said this  and I will repeat it:  Weshould not as a general  rule make policy by trying to stabilize international  currency values.  Ourbest contribution  to the  world economy  is to keep  our own house in order, our own inflation  rateslow  and stable or perhaps  zero and stable,  and our own real  output  growth healthy  and6/30-7/1/98sustainable.  But the  Asian crisis  is unique.  At every meeting  we hear about new countries onthe danger list.  The last time it was Russia and Brazil.  This time it is Pakistan  and South Africa.The next time we  will have  a number of other countries,  perhaps.  The linchpin is Japan, andover the  last few  meetings conditions there have been  described in bleaker and  bleaker terms.The Japanese  are now  finally considering  closing some banks and disposing of their assets, butover what  seems like a rather relaxed  schedule.  Even  if they do  this, this step  is only a necessarycondition to  arrest their downturn, not a sufficient condition.  In the short run,  closing banks islikely to be contractionary, not expansionary.  I think it is almost inevitable  that Japan's reboundwill be delayed,  at least in relation to the  Greenbook timetable.  To turn their economy around,they probably need a  large and  permanent tax cut, exactly the item omitted from their recentstimulus package.  Until  they do this,  and perhaps  go beyond, both the Japanese  economy andthe yen  probably will  fall further, reducing  growth  prospects in the rest  of the world includingthe United States.Adding all this up, I am  still roughly  comfortable  with the present policy.  Given theincipient  slowdown,  tightening  is probably not now called for in this country.  Internationally,one might argue,  as my colleague  to my right does or seemed  to a  minute ago, for tightening  andletting the yen depreciate  a little.  But given the asset  situation and the inter-country  links withinAsia, that is a rather dangerous  stance  at the present time.  I think there  is a  very strong  argumentfor continuing the watchful  waiting policy that we have  been  following  and waiting for the risksto clarify.  Who  knows  when they finally  will?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  A strong thread has  been running  throughthe discussion all  afternoon  relating to the stark difference  between  the domestic  and the foreign6/30-7/1/98outlook.  It is leaving us with  an unusual  and bifurcated  decision  mix that I find ratheruncomfortable.  If we think about the United  States economy  domestically  and in isolation fromforeign  impacts,  we see a very,  very strong economy.  It is coming  off a very robust first quarter.Job formation  continues  strong, unemployment  is very  low, business and consumer  sentiment issky high, credit is readily  available  on reasonable terms, the federal  budget is balanced,  the  stockinfluenced by inventories  and that part of the economy is probably in  the process of rebalancing.But I think of inventories  as having a rather transitory  influence that is  going to hit the economyin one  direction  or the other from time to time, and we have to look past that.  Looking forward,it is very hard for me to see the domestic  economy slowing  spontaneously  to or below anyreasonable  definition of sustainability for any extended period  of time.  That scenario  clearly hasthe potential  of being inflationary  at some  point.  My fear is that  we may be  close to that point.An incipient inflationary trend may now be starting to become  visible,  and I think that trendshould be  countered.However,  internationally,  as  we know  and  as we have been discussing,  we  perceive  atotally different  view of the world.  Asia is  the centerpiece,  especially  Japan.  We have beendiscussing that  at length  and I will not replay the  discussion.  The problem  is not only Asia.Western European  economies  look very  good right now, but they have a major challenge on  theirhands in making EMU work.  Of course, they have clawingon their doorstep.  Much  of Latin America  is fragile  as usual,  and it seems to me that they  are ata watershed  where they could  very possibly institutionalize  a  major, strong,  and lastingbreakthrough,  which would be wonderful,  or they could fall back into stagnation  for another6/30-7/1/98It seems to me  that for the United States to  embark on  a round of policy tighteningright now could be very  destabilizing from an international standpoint.  How  do we positionpolicy  in view  of this bifurcation?  The Federal Reserve  creates policy  obviously in the nationalinterest of the United  States.  But the state  of the world around us is certainly part  of that nationalinterest for obvious reasons.  In my judgment, the precarious  state of the world economy  seemsto preclude tightening  by the Committee  at this time, or maybe I  should just say at this meeting.The international  impact may yet prove to be just the right thing to offset the rising pressures  inour domestic  economy, and we may indeed get the Greenbook's  soft landing scenario.  I hope so.But I have to say that I  do increasingly  fear that at the end of the day we may have to pay a highprice  for delay.

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I'm the last to speak, so I willtry to be brief.  We  received a number of signals during the intermeeting  period.  Many of theseindicators  point to a continued uptrend in the economy, perhaps  at a slower pace but notnecessarily  one that is without inflation risks.As  others have  said, jobs continue to be plentiful.  The labor market is tight.  April's4.3 percent  unemployment  rate was not  a fluke.  Indeed,  for the  year through May,  theunemployment rate averaged  about 4.5  percent, which  is probably below anyone's  reasonableestimate of the NAIRU.  Disturbingly, these labor markets  are clearly creating  some conditionsfor wage-induced  inflation that in my view  are noticeably stronger  than earlier.  Average hourlyearnings increased  4.3  percent over the past  12  months, up from 3.9  percent in the prior 12months and in  turn  up from 3.3 percent  in the  12 months before  that.  In addition,  the so-calledindicators of worker insecurity  appear to have turned toward  increasing security.  President6/30-7/1/98Broaddus  talked about his son.  The median duration  of unemployment  is  not normally twoweeks  but it is down to  about five weeks  from eight weeks  previously.  The quit rate is back  upand labor force participation has not  grown further.I recognize that productivity  increases  may offset some of the  nominal wage increases,and in this regard I  am hopeful  that  the staff is right and in fact I think that they probably  are.However,  the difference  between  nominal wage  gains  and productivity  growth,  even assumingsome  uptick in productivity  trend, is growing  ever larger.  In  my view,  the  gap between wagegains and productivity  growth is putting increasing  pressure on businesses to translate  some ofthese wage  gains into price increases, particularly  if the growth  of profit margins  is slowing.Someone  mentioned earlier that the yield curve  was flattening.  As I  see it, theflattening is being  driven  more by the long end than the short end, which  does not  suggest to mea slowing  of the economy.  In  fact, it  might be having  a stimulative  effect.  So, I believe weshould be cautious  about putting  too much weight on  the flattening.  Finally, as  others have  said,the strength in  labor markets  is feeding  unabated  demand for consumer  goods, and interest-sensitive goods,  housing in  particular, have  continued to display strength.Others  have talked about the  Greenbook  forecast,  and I will quickly  give my read onit, which is not dramatically different  from that  of others.  The staff suggests that the  extremelystrong economic  picture is  going to be cooled to lower growth  rates by net exports, correction  ofinventory overhang,  and some moderation  in the PCE uptrend.  I think there is  at best  only thebarest evidence  in support of this deceleration  story.The net  export story, as the Greenbook  indicates,  is  actually  more past than prologue.The staff forecast says  that the worst of the direct  retarding impact from net exports  alreadyoccurred  in the first quarter and that  going forward we  are  likely to see  less of a  direct impact6/30-7/1/98from that  sector of the economy.  Therefore,  we are relying on  a multiplier-accelerator  story toachieve  the desired results,  as  I think Mike Prell  suggested in response  to  President Poole'squestion.Similarly,  with respect to the  slowdown  in inventory accumulation,  I think I'm in thesame  camp  as President  Minehan.  Inventory-to-shipment  ratios in  manufacturing  have edged  uponly  slightly, and they remain below where they were in January.  Wholesale  inventory-to-salesratios  also seem to  be quite well behaved.  Admittedly, maintaining  these ratios does  not requirea continued  $100  billion annual  rate of inventory increase, but it does seem likely that there maybe  more of an increase  or less of a slowdown  than  the staff expects.Finally, the staff is  looking forward  to some  slowdown  in PCE due to a slowing inwealth  creation  from the  stock market and a  slight uptick in unemployment.  The rise  in theunemployment  rate in the  Greenbook  forecast is  only to about 4.5  percent this year, which Ibelieve most  of us would not regard  as an indication  of a  loose labor market.  The slowdown  inthe  stock market may turn  out, as usual, to be more  ephemeral than  real.  So,  I see some real riskson the upside,  particularly with respect  to the domestic  economy.There are, as others have  indicated,  some countervailing  and potentially growing  riskson the downside.  The strike at GM,  I think, is likely to exert  a short-term but noticeable  shock.The international  developments  that others have talked  about are  certainly no less certain.  Theone thing I could add, after coming back from Japan  and talking to some  private-sectorforecasters there, is that I believe the base forecast  that the staff has  presented to us is  somewhatmore optimistic  than those  forecasters in Japan currently  believe.  So,  there is some moredownside potential  there.6/30-7/1/98In  summary, I believe that the risks to the upside still exist.  However, none of theseworries  are  yet realities.  The staff forecast  may materialize  and, like others, I  hope that it does.  Ithink that the risks to the downside are  a  little stronger now  than they were at the time of the  lastmeeting.  There  obviously  is continued international  instability.  On balance,  I would go  with theword "uncertain"  in characterizing  the outlook.  The future is quite uncertain  and I think noaction  is required on our part, either up or down.  The more prudent course  is, again,  to wait andsee.  It appears  to be the most responsible among the difficult  choices that we  face.  The nextmeeting  may have a different  outcome, but I think this is the appropriate  outcome  for thismeeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we have time this afternoon  for one last item onthe agenda.  You may recall  a fairly elaborate  paper  that was circulated entitled  "Issues Arisingfrom the Zero Constraint on Nominal  Interest Rates.'  I don't think we will  want to get involvedin  a particularly  long discussion  of this issue, but I do think it's probably  worthwhile  for DonKohn to take a  few minutes  to summarize  the paper. Then  we  will  see how much  of a discussionwe wish  to get into before  we adjourn  for the evening.  Don.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I will try to be brief, Mr. Chairman.  My colleagues,David Reifschneider  and David Small,  who did much of the  work  on thepaper are seated  at the table.  Hopefully, they  will answer your questions!This study was prepared  in response to  a discussion  at the Februarymeeting of the  Committee.  A number of you noted that for several  decadesthe Committee had focused  on reducing  inflation from high levels that wereclearly  unacceptable.  The inflation rate was  now low enough  that it seemedappropriate  to consider  how much further it should go down  and what trendrate would be most consistent  with maximum economic  growth.  Thatnominal  interest rates cannot go below  zero is one aspect of such aconsideration.  This zero constraint  comes  into play when  inflation is  lowbecause nominal  interest rates  also are  low  at the  same time.  If in thissituation the economy  is hit with a  downward shock  and policy is eased andif the economy is  then hit with another downward  shock or policy eases tooslowly, the Federal Open Market Committee  could find itself constrained  in6/30-7/1/98its  ability to  continue  to support the economy and the economy couldworsen  further.Very  briefly summarizing the results of the paper, one  is that beingcaught  at a zero  bound nominal rate is probably  a very rare event.  Policyerrors  are one reason  the Committee  could get  caught there,  and that is morelikely, obviously,  when the starting point is a low inflation  rate.  Beingcaught  at the zero nominal  bound could have  very  serious consequences.There  were two ways  that the study approached  this issue.  One was bylooking  at history.  The  1930s in  the United States provide one example  ofmonetary policy caught  at the zero  nominal  bound, particularly from  1932through  most of the rest of the  1930s.  In the  1990s, the approach  of the zeronominal bound in Japan  seems to have  constrained policy  there.The other way the  study looked at this was through model  simulations.There  it was  shown  that hitting a model of the economy with shocksrepresenting  unexpected events,  the zero nominal bound tended to  presentproblems  and tended to produce  longer and more  frequent occasions whenthe economy was  producing below potential  after starting from  an inflationrate of 1 percent or lower.A second  suggestion  of the paper was that the Committee  can structuremonetary policy actions to reduce  the odds of ending up  at the  zero nominalbound by being more  aggressive in  countering  downside surprises wheninflation  is already low.  Now, this can  be seen to some  extent in the oneplace in the  paper where the  staff looked at an alternative to a Taylor Rulethat had more  aggressive  coefficients  so that the Federal  Open MarketCommittee  reacted more  strongly to output and inflation  gaps.  That is asymmetrical kind of reaction.  One can also imagine  an  asymmetricalreaction  where the Committee reacts  particularly  strongly to the threat ofdeflation when  inflation is  already at  a low rate.  But it is not easy toimplement  such  a policy.  The Committee  needs  to identify the  surprise,needs  to be confident that inflation is moving  down to dangerously lowlevels, and needs to be willing to take risks by moving  aggressively  againstdeflation or a potential  deflationary  shock.  The Committee needs to take therisk that if it is wrong, inflation  might re-emerge  and the Committee  wouldthen have  to counter that--would  have to reverse  course.  So this  asymmetricstrategy requires a willingness to take risks.A third conclusion  of the paper was  that once the Committee findsitself at the lower bound, its options are limited.  Fiscal  policy is probablythe most effective way of stimulating the  economy when monetary policy istrapped by the zero bound,  but the central  bank cannot  count on the  fiscalauthorities,  as we certainly  are  seeing in Japan  today.  The monetaryauthorities  have at their disposal  some fiscal-type  actions  that they could6/30-7/1/98take, for example,  making  loans to private parties  at  a subsidized  rate,  whichthe  paper  did not consider  on the thought that it  was more  a  part of fiscalpolicy than  monetary  policy.Unorthodox  monetary policy  may work, but it obviously  would have tobe  through channels  other than reducing  short-term interest  rates  since  theyare already  at zero.  Those channels might include reducing  expectedshort-term  rates by tilting down  long-term  rates, or reducing term  or riskpremiums  in long-term rates.  The latter also  would tend to reduce  long-termrates  and exchange  rates  as well.Pumping  up the monetary  base by  itself would be  unlikely to beeffective  in doing  either of these things, that  is, reducing  short-term rateexpectations  or term and risk premiums.  Such increases  in the base  wouldtend to  go into excess  reserves  and there is no obvious  reason why thatwould change  expectations  about future  rates.  Tilting open marketoperations  to a limited degree  toward bonds  or foreign  exchange  also is notlikely to do much.  Studies show  that modest  changes  in the supply ofbonds,  Operation Twist kinds  of things, do not have much  effect on bondyields.  Sterilized  intervention, which  is what in  effect  such  foreignexchange  buying  would be,  also does not do much.  However,  massivepurchases  of bonds  or massive intervention  might.  The Federal  Reserve  didset the  rate on government  bonds during World War II.  If a  central  bankwere willing to purchase  all  the supply  of government bonds,  it could set thebond rate again,  and presumably  this would  feed through to  corporateborrowing  rates  as well.  So,  there are extreme  policies  involving massivepurchases  that  should work in lowering  term premiums  and risk premiums.In considering  how low  inflation  should go, the zero  bound is only onepart of the calculations.  There  are a  number of other potential  costs andbenefits.  On  the benefits  side, the paper did not deal at all with the extragrowth,  productivity,  or efficiency that might  result from  an economyoperating  at very  low or even  zero rates  of inflation.  Unfortunately,  it ishard  to quantify with confidence  the  gains from going to zero inflation  orthe costs  of the zero bound.A final  question  is  whether there  are  any implications  of this  analysisfor the  Committee's consideration  over  the next  couple of years.  For onething, there could be a practical policy issue  at some point.  Right now, ofcourse,  the funds  rate  is at  5-1/2 percent  and the risk, as a number of youalready  have noted, is  for inflation to be rising.  A  zero  bound problem doesnot seem  to be in  the cards,  but it is not  impossible  to imagine  a situationinvolving lower inflation  and lower nominal  interest rates.  We have  tendedto overpredict  inflation  over the last few  years.  I think one of the lessonsfrom the United States  in the  1930s  and Japan in the  1990s  is that problemshave  tended to follow  sharp breaks  in  asset prices coupled  with  sluggish6/30-7/1/98monetary responses because the  authorities  were concerned  aboutre-igniting  asset price increases  or inflation  and  with destabilizing  fiscalpolicy because the fiscal authorities  were focused on  budget balance  orlong-term  surplus.  Given  the  level  of equity  prices today in the UnitedStates, I don't think we are  invulnerable  to a  sharp break in equity  prices,the initiating  step in this sequence.  And if it came  on top of a  situationsomewhere  down  the road in which  foreign economies  were worsening  andthe dollar was appreciating,  it is not beyond imagination  to think that thiskind of situation might be  one where the Committee might consider whetherit wanted some  strong asymmetric  responses  to downward  shocks  to theeconomy.From a different  perspective,  the Committee  might want to considerwhether it has anything  useful to  communicate to the public  about thelong-run  context of its policy decisions.  If the Committee  had a  sense that  itwould lean  hard against  inflation rates  that tended to drop  to very,  very lowlevels or to zero,  there might be  some benefit from laying out the issues forthe public.  It would  allow markets  to anticipate  such actions and  suchanticipation might help to bring down  long-term rates.  You will rememberthat one of the problems in  Japan in the early  1990s  and in the United Statesin the early  1930s was  that it took long-term rates a  long time to comedown, presumably  because  markets  were  anticipating that the authoritieswould bring rates  back up  again.  If the Committee were  not going to dothat, it  might be useful to inform  people.  That also  would promote  a publicdebate, understanding,  and  accountability  of how the Federal  Reserveinterpreted the price  stability mandated in the Federal Reserve Act.Now may not be the  best time.  Since  the Committee  is worried  aboutinflation  going up, there would be a risk of misinterpretation  if it started totalk  about a supposition  that inflation  might get too low.  But at some pointin the future, I think a public discussion of these  issues might beconstructive  for all concerned.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions  for Don?

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I think this is  a very nice piece  of work, but if I were  assigned a job ofrefereeing  it for a journal,  I know  that it would take me two  or three  days,  maybe a week, of hardfull-time work  to get  through the paper and  get to the bottom  of it.  There are  a lot of veryinteresting but very important  technical  issues  affecting  how the  staff gets these results.  I thinkthe overall  issue is extremely  important  as  a backdrop to a  decision, which  I hope we  will reach  atsome point, that our long-run  policy  goal is zero inflation  properly measured, whatever  that might6/30-7/1/98mean in terms of the actual  CPI.  I believe  we need to be clear about all the technical issuesinvolved before  we actually confront  this as  a  live issue.  I would  propose that this paper be putinto whatever is the appropriate  form and sent out to four or five academic  specialists inmacroeconomics  who  approach  these  issues from different perspectives  to give us the bestprofessional  opinions.  I have spent  so little time on the paper that I hesitate even to comment onit.  I spent a  couple of hours reading  and thinking  about it, and  I have thought about these issuesbefore. I don't know whether  you want to get into a substantive  discussion  on this,  Mr.Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I will tell you one thing that I do  not want to do  and thatis  to send this out of this room  or out of this building and have it leaked  to the newspapers.  If thatwere to happen,  it would give all  the wrong signals.  I don't know how to avoid having somebodyleak it.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I  agree.  Obviously,  if it is  going outside,  it would have to be done in  away that  would not cause us grief from that point of view.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I don't know how we would do  it!

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think, Mr. Chairman, the  staff does  intend to try and re-dress the paperand put pieces  of it out, the model simulations in particular,  as a working paper in the workingpaper series here.  There  is another paper on this general  topic that has been  presented  at collegeseminars by other Federal  Reserve researchers.  There  has been  a publication  of a paper by BrianMadigan  and Jeff Fuhrer on this  issue.  I think we  could take the paper  out of the immediate policycontext  so that people would not know that the Federal  Open Market Committee had  been workingon it, and we could get academic  comment  on it.  It has been  done before.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If you feel confident, I feel confident  as I shake!  [Laughter]6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  I feel  less confident now than I did a few  minutes  ago!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  This  is an issue that has been discussed in  the academic  literature for  along, long time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I know  and it is  a crucial issue.  A couple  of years  agowe had an extended  discussion  of the  Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry paper.  It is a very crucialissue, and I think it is important  for us over the  long run  to  get a fix on it.  I am concerned  aboutthe press  looking  for any indication  of what we might be thinking.  I would be worried  aboutcreating the wrong sense of our thinking.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  In any case,  though,  I think we should take up what I heard  as BillPoole's offer to give it a very serious review.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That would commit him to a week  of hard  labor!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I think  that getting other input on  the paper, if a way  canbe found without creating  all  kinds  of problems for us,  would be very desirable.  But like theresearch that was  done a couple  of years  ago on  the costs  and  benefits  of reducing  inflation, I havea difficulty with the  starting point.  To  reduce  inflation from  any inherited situation implies initialconditions  and policies  that set in motion  certain  dynamics  as  opposed  to starting from thepremise  that we  have  stable purchasing power of money.  Stable  purchasing power  of money doesnot mean  that the prices  of all  assets  or goods or services  are  unchanged.  What  it means is  thatthe  weighted-average  of relevant  price categories  is not rising or falling.Once we  start from that concept of the stable purchasing  power of the currency,  whichis the idea  we are  trying to implant into  the minds  of decisionmakers--households  and businessesalike--I think we  come out a little differently.  Suppose  that is our initial condition  and we then6/30-7/1/98have  a favorable  productivity  shock,  maybe like the one we have had in the  last couple  of years.That means an  increase in the purchasing  power of money because  the weighted  average  of pricesthat are  falling  exceeds the  weighted average  of prices that are rising.  There  is  some literature  onthis, the  work that George  Selgin  and others  have  done about the productivity norm for inflation.A couple  of economists  in Britain  also  have done  some work  on that issue.  A central  bank canconduct  a monetary policy  in that environment  through  a monetary base  arrangement  of supplyand demand for central  bank money.  It does not create problems  of the type that I see  in thispaper  derived from the Taylor framework.  So, even  if we consider  a Taylor framework  approach,there is another or different way of approaching  the  same question  that I do not see included  inthis paper.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think a  favorable productivity  shock, even in  the context of this paper,would not present  the Committee with  a problem  for the reasons that were discussed earlier inthis meeting.  Such a shock tends to raise the equilibrium real interest rate and it tends to boostgrowth.  I think what becomes  an issue  in this  paper is downward  shocks to demand.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  That is why I referred to initial conditions.  We do  not get thatliquidity trap effect where efforts to increase  the monetary  base only add to excess reservesunless we  start with the initial  condition  of inadequate  aggregate  demand.  If we  start with  afavorable  productivity shock  and we  have  stable purchasing  power  of money, then the  real rateof return to real  productive capital  has actually  gone up.  We don't have a  problem then.  Weonly have it in  this inadequate  excess  demand  framework.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I just wanted to comment that I was struck by the juxtaposition  of ahighly theoretical  and really interesting  paper that we received  at the same time we  got  a paper6/30-7/1/98on the  real  world that shows  that the Japanese  government  and the  Bank of Japan  are faced  withthe same range  of choices  that the  staff put on the table in the  theoretical paper.  It wasfascinating to read the  two as companion  papers,  as I did,  and realize that the theory matches  thereality fairly closely.  That theory says that the Japanese  do not have  much they can  do other thanmassive fiscal  intervention  or massive depreciation  of the currency.  We know  depreciation  ofthe yen is not going to be a  healthy choice for a  lot of reasons.  So, massive  fiscal  interventionseems to be their only option.I think it is a  good idea to get the theoretical  paper more  thoroughly vetted.  I wouldworry, however, about some of the untried monetary policy options that are mentioned  in thepaper including operations  in the futures  market  and in the options  market and making directloans of a significant size to nonbank borrowers.  I think all  of those  options, if they wereperceived  as really under consideration  by the central  bank, would create difficulties  for us.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  I think the  intention, President Minehan,  was to concentrate  on themodeling part of the paper,  not on the other part.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I see, although  policy options do get included to a minor extent insome of the  variations  you put into play in  the modeling exercise.  In any event, the paper mademe conscious  of the  fact that  there are  a lot of other papers on this subject that I read a long timeago,  and I am going  to go  back  and reread them.  So, I thank you for that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Over the weekend?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Likely  more than a weekend.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I think this is a very interesting,  useful, and important  study.  I wouldagree that it involves  a very difficult  subject to study, and all  of us probably  should spend  a lot6/30-7/1/98more  time with it.  I think Don Kohn hit on most of the quite interesting issues  that I  saw in  thepaper.  I found  the one  about taking more vigorous  or aggressive  action  a fairly significant point.If we are operating  under a Taylor Rule,  I guess in effect what we are envisioning is that we havehigher coefficients  on  the  two gaps that cause  policy to move  more aggressively.  It may alsocause policy to move in  a  more preemptive  way, which we can do even  under a Taylor Rule ifwe have  forecasting.  So,  I think that is interesting.The other interesting point relates to  what may be,  at least  in terms  of these models,the advantage of setting  a goal that is a little above zero.  The simulations  seem to  suggest that ifwe have  1 to 2 percent inflation  as our goal,  we would run into the zero bound constraint veryfew  times.  Again, this is in terms of the simulations  in those  models,  but I think it's a quiteinteresting  result.  I frankly did find some of the  alternative  policy options interesting, inparticular the "put"  option to bring long-term interest  rates down;  perhaps  it does  have somepractical  relevance  to real world  situations.I  want to make  a couple  of additional  points, which may be related  to some that BillPoole  brought up.  It  seems to  me that a deflation  with zero interest rates is  somewhat similar  ineffect  to a break in history  in the  sense that we  have  estimated a Keynesian  model over a periodof history where we  really have  not had this basic condition.  So,  it may not be all that strangethat the results  are not particularly satisfying, as  often  would be the case if we had a break inhistory.It also is conceivable,  although  I basically  buy the Keynesian  approach,  that we mayhave regime  shifts  at  different points.  In hyperinflation  we may have a different regime  than wewould at zero inflation.  Although  I know  you looked at some different  models, they did notseem to me to involve complete  regime  shifts.6/30-7/1/98The third point is that I would like to see somebody,  maybe Bill Poole,  give themonetarists'  explanation.  I have  seen  an article  where Friedman has offered  some comments  onthis  issue.  After all,  not everybody in this world believes  that we  should focus solely  on interestrates  and therefore  that central  bank purchases  of securities  do not accomplish  anything when  weare  at zero interest rates.  They  do increase the monetary base, and if one believes  that quantitiesare what  is important, that can  have an impact.  I would like to see other viewpoints,  which wecould get in a  conference.  I don't think it has to be a  forum the Committee  would necessarilyendorse,  but we should try  to get the  views  of other people who  have thought long and hardabout these  issues over the  years.  This  staff paper is a  good work, but  I think it is a good  work ina particular religion.  We  might look at  a few  other religions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I just realized that the paper could go out withoutdifficulty  and sensitivity if it were sent out by Ted Truman.  [Laughter] It is so obviously theJapanese  issue and not ours.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Bob Parry already  made  my point and I would just underline  thatthis is an interesting paper.  It is an  important  subject, and I think it deserves  discussion.  Ifthere's  a public perception  problem, then I think we could, at  least as a  starter, have  a very robustdiscussion  within the  System.  There  are  a lot of people  on our staffs who  are working  on thisissue  and are interested in  new  approaches  using different  models.  It seems to  me that would besomething  we should consider  as a first  step.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I want to  support the point that has just beenmade.  I think we  have enough intellectual  resources  within the  System that have not beenbrought to bear on this paper  because of the  shortage  of time.  It was very  difficult for any  of usto spend enough time on it, let alone to have  an in-depth discussion  with our staffs on it.  I thinkthat a robust discussion within the Federal  Reserve System, which certainly  does not create thesecurity problem that I believe is a  very real  one, would be  much to be desired.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Much  has already been  said, but I want very briefly to reiterate  someof President Jordan's  comments.  If I understood  correctly, this  model's parameters  weredeveloped  in a period  when we had declining inflation.  I believe it is very important, though,that we look at it in the context of zero inflation and a  stable economic  situation  and thenevaluate  the effects  of shocks.  I believe that would be  very  important.  A broader discussion  orconference  on this issue probably  would bring out that kind of analysis.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Are  you suggesting  what the topic  at Jackson  Hole willbe  next year?

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  I am open to suggestions.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I thought this was a very interesting  and very useful  study  and entirelyrelevant, not only to what is going  on in Japan  but to the low inflation environment  that is now  inplace throughout the developed  economies  of the world.  I would feel more confident  about theresults if they were replicated  in a variety of other models.  I would be particularly concernedabout the rational  expectations  focus of the FRB-US  model relative  to some other econometricmodels, but I would like to  see it played out in a variety of models.6/30-7/1/98What I found exciting  in the  paper were the implications  for both policy  strategy  andfor policy objectives.  I think it is a very relevant point that  when  we have  a situation  whereinflation  is low and  we don't have much  room to  move nominal  rates,  we can compensate  forquantity with  speed and more  aggressive moves.  This notion of asymmetric  responses  todownward versus upward shocks  is a very interesting  one.  Having  said that, I  am a  littleskeptical that the Committee would be  willing to  move as aggressively  as is contemplated  inthose models,  given uncertainty  and the need to build broad consensus  for policy changes.On  policy objectives, I  see this as  a part  of a long discussion that we seem  to be havinga couple  times a  year with regard to how we would set an  explicit inflation target  if we everthat it reinforced  my view  that an appropriate inflation  target would be price  stability  plus acushion where  this cushion  was related to  the potential  adverse consequences  of setting too lowan inflation target.  I would  like to see further work along these  lines and I would be delighted  tosee outside reviews  of this study.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I, too, thought this was  a useful  study, especially in terms of getting usto think more  concretely  about  our objectives.  We do have  a lot of talent available  within theSystem.  We could spend time profitably  with some further analysis  and discussion  of all of this.I did have  a  couple of reservations  about  the study at least with the  way I interpretedwhat we have  here.  One  is a point that Don Kohn touched  on that I would  emphasize.  It is thatif we think there are  significant long-term  benefits  to low inflation in  terms of productivity  andgrowth  and so forth, then worrying  about what we  might do in terms  of countercyclical  policyseems to be a  second order question.  It  almost has  the flavor of saying that while we have  a6/30-7/1/98distortionary  tax in place  we want to  leave it in place  right now even  though it  adversely  affectsthe economy because it  gives us something to do if conditions  turn bad.  I suspect  that there issome problem  with that,  and I would like to think this through more fully.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  President  Stern  has picked up  my point.  I thought the paper wasvery interesting,  but in  some sense quite inwardly focused  because it is all  about what we shoulddo.  It missed what for me is an important  point, the one in the Akerlof paper to which theChairman  alluded.  I  guess I would like to see added to  this  study some sense  of the impact  onthe real economy from  having inflation at  various  levels.  Is 2 percent inflation  right?  Is zeroinflation  right?  Which  one does better in terms of productivity,  in terms of investment,  in termsof flexible  labor markets?  I think it would be useful  to have a summary of the information  that isavailable  on this issue.  Otherwise,  we are  aiming  at a target  that may have  very little  to do withour general  goal  of creating  an economy that is performing  well  overall.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Unfortunately,  we did  turn the  best minds  in the System  loose on thatthree or four  years  ago, and they could not reach  a  conclusion.  [Laughter]  They could not  showthat there  were benefits from reducing the rate of inflation  below  2 or 3  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Given the turnover of the Committee,  it probably  would be sensible  forus  to recirculate  that material,  at least to all those who  have not received it.

[SECTION]

MR.  FERGUSON.  We  also have  to put it in a broader context.  Those of us whohave recently  been  confirmed as  Board members  had to go through  a  bit of grilling  by  a fewsenators on why we did  not think  an inflation  target might be a good idea.  It is easy to dancearound that issue, but  it would be nice to attack it directly.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We have  to be a little careful.  I think we havedemonstrated  in this country in the last four or five years that the notion  that was held rathertentatively,  namely that  low inflation has a  very significant and favorable  effect on long-termeconomic  growth, is now  being held very firmly.  In other words, the experience we have justgone through  has really demonstrated  statistically  or at least has added  a few  important datapoints that corroborate  the crucial importance  of low  inflation on maximum  sustainable growth.If we start to  get into a mode  of worrying  about not getting  down too close to zero inflation, wethat.  We have to be a little careful  about keeping the  appropriate  balance in  our discussionsbecause  it can be  very easy for us to conclude  that it would be a disaster if we got to zero interestrates  and got to the type  of phenomenon  that Japan  is  experiencing.  We  may be tempted toconclude that the simplest  way to avoid that situation  is to keep  inflation  at 5 percent, whichmeans we will  end up with inflation  at  10 percent.  That's a  slight exaggeration.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  That's not  where  we are now!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It's not where  we are now,  but I just want to  stipulatethat these types of discussions can  take on  a bias that we  never intended them to take.  We haveto make  sure we are  wary  of that.

MR. GRAMLICH.  I have the unenvied  position of being chair of the Board'sCommittee on Economic  Affairs,  and I have  been wondering  about not having a whole lot on ourplate.  [Laughter]  One thing this Committee  might do,  as  some  already have  suggested, is toorganize  a conference.  If we were to do that, I think we  definitely  should open  it to people6/30-7/1/98outside the  System and get different  economists in on this.  I would like to see us getrepresentatives  from different  countries,  and in  Bob Parry's  terms, different  religions  as well--rational expectations,  monetarism, and so  forth.  I personally would like to have somebody take  alook at the  costs and benefits  of different  inflation  targets.  Maybe these  are well-trodden  issues,but I have not seen too much on them since  I've been here,  and in  any event  I think some  newstudies  are being produced.  So, I would not give up on that.  How best to do this is something  Imight volunteer to think  about with the staff.  Again,  I do think our study should be broadenedbeyond the System because  there is  a lot of academic  talent out there that both insulates  us andimproves the academic  product.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good  morning.  We'll begin with a discussion  of ourlonger-run  objectives  for money and debt growth.  I call  on Bill Whitesell to start us off.

[SECTION]

MR. WHITESELL.  The  Committee again must decide  whether tomake  any adjustments  in the ranges for money  and debt growth, which havebeen unchanged  since mid-1995.  In recent years, the Committee has beeninterpreting the monetary  ranges  as those that would be consistent  with pricestability  and normal velocity behavior, while the debt range, by contrast, hasremained  fairly well centered on  the staff's projected  growth rate for thisaggregate.  One reason  for adopting this rationale  for the monetary  rangeswas uncertainty  about the behavior  of velocity early in this decade.The handout reproduces  several  charts  from the Bluebook that  examinemore recent evidence  on this issue. 3/  Chart 4 depicts  the relationship of M2velocity to opportunity  costs--defined  as the three-month  Treasury bill rateless the weighted-average  interest rate  on M2 assets.  Breaking the  analysisinto four subperiods  allows  for shifts in  the level  of velocity--the  largest byfar being that of the early  1990s.  The  elasticity of V2  with respect  toopportunity costs was held constant  across the four subperiods  at its valueestimated  over  1977 to  1990.  The panel  on the lower right indicates  that,after allowing for a  level  shift in  the early  1990s,  M2  velocity has  had aboutas close a relationship to opportunity costs  recently  as it did in the past.Chart 5  plots the percentage  deviations  of V2  as  predicted by opportunitycosts from its actual  levels.  For the recent period,  while the  errors tend torun in the same  direction for a while,  they are not larger  on  average thanthose for other historical periods.But even  if M2 velocity is  again as predictable  as it was prior to thisto center a range  of 4 percentage  points in width on its forecast  of M2,which  was based on its desired  growth of nominal  spending.  If M2 began tomove out of that range because  of a  departure  of GDP from expectations,the monetary  aggregate would be providing an  appropriate  signal  for policy.However, M2  may at times diverge from  its range not because ofmovements  of GDP but because  of unforeseen  interest rate changes  or noisein  money demand.  Such divergences  would be reflected in  errors inforecasting  velocity,  which  are investigated  in the upper panel of Chart 6.The solid line  shows the errors in  the  Board staff's predictions in Februaryof the annual  growth of M2 velocity,  based on Greenbook  interest rateassumptions.  The parallel  dashed lines show  a 4  percentage point  range3/  Copies of the charts are  appended to the  transcript.  (Appendix  3)6/30-7/1/98around the projections.  There  were  six cases  in the last 15 years in whicherrors  in predicting  V2 were outside that range.  The dotted  line adjusts theerrors in  V2 for deviations of the federal  funds rate from Greenbookassumptions;  two of the  six velocity forecast  errors exceeding the rangewidth  could plausibly be attributed  to unforeseen  interest rate  changes,  whilethe  other four were evidently  noise in money demandThis  analysis  suggests that if you do again  use a range for M2 thatreflects  M2's forecast  growth for the year,  you should expect  on occasion adeparture  from that range because  of unpredictable  elements in moneydemand  and not  only because  a change in policy was needed  or was made.Despite the uncertainty  in money demand,  M2 still  seems to be of someuse as an economic  indicator.  For instance,  there is a strong  correlationbetween the  growth of M2 in one year and the growth  of nominal  GDP inthe next.  Another example  of the indicator value  of M2 is shown  in thelower panel of Chart 6, which  plots surprises  in nominal  GDP relative to thestaff forecast  along with  surprises in M2  adjusted for the effects  ofdeviations  of the  funds rate from Greenbook  assumptions.  The positivecorrelation  suggests  that incoming data on M2,  which are available  wellbefore the final  GDP numbers, give some guidance on contemporaneousdevelopments  in nominal  spending.  The Bluebook  provided  a similaranalysis  of M3,  not shown  here,  and found that the forecast errors for thevelocity  of M3 have been  slightly larger than those for M2,  while therelationship  of M3  to GDP is a little  weaker than that for M2.The final page  of the  handout is a table from the Bluebook showing thestaff projections for money and debt growth  and three  alternative  sets ofranges for the Committee's  consideration.  We expect that growth of moneyand of debt will  slow from their robust pace over the first half of this  year,largely because  of a deceleration  of nominal  spending.  In addition,  thedifferentials  between  the  growth rates of these aggregates  and nominal GDPare projected to narrow in  an environment  in which longer-term  interestrates edge  up  and the stock market  slips off a bit.  Committee members  mayhave a somewhat  stronger  outlook for money and  debt growth than the  staff,as the  central  tendencies  of your forecasts  for nominal  GDP  exceed theGreenbook projections  by something in the  neighborhood of 1/2  percentagepoint for this  year and  1 percentage  point  for 1999.  This would implyhigher money  growth by similar amounts,  other things equal.  However, acouple of you noted yesterday that you  had assumed  a higher funds rate inmaking your forecasts,  and that would damp money  growth.  For instance,  afunds rate 3/4 percentage  point higher by the  end of this year would  meannearly  a percentage  point weaker M2  growth over  1999, and the combinedeffects  of the stronger nominal  GDP and this higher funds rate  could beroughly a  wash.6/30-7/1/98In  1998, M2  and M3 are projected by the staff to grow  appreciablyfaster than their current ranges,  shown  in alternative  I, and M3 is expected  toexceed its current range  next year.  Alternative  II  shows ranges reasonablycentered on the staff projections  for money  and debt growth  for  1999,  albeitwith the midpoints of the M3 and debt ranges  a bit below the staff projectionon the  thought that the Committee's  concerns  about inflation pressuressuggest that you would rather round the ranges  down than  up.  AlternativeIII could  be used if the Committee  wished to adjust the range for the debtaggregate downward  further to make it consistent  with the expected  growthof debt under conditions  of price  stability, assuming  the members  see  trendnominal  GDP growth  at price  stability  of around 3  percent,  as does the staff.While  the monetary  aggregates  have some  value  as economic  indicatorswhen considered in the context  of a  variety of other variables,  it is nowwidely recognized  that the monetary  aggregates  are not suitable for a role asintermediate  policy targets.  Nonetheless,  ranges for money and debt  growthcan be  a useful means  for the Committee  to communicate to the public.  Ifyou prefer  to avoid  attracting any attention  to these financial  quantities  andhave no intention  of using them in policymaking, then  leaving the ranges for1998 unchanged  and carrying them  forward to  1999 might be  your choice.You could  also use  the ranges to communicate  to the public the  rate ofinflation  you believe  to be consistent with maximum economic  growth overthe long run; this might be true price  stability  as implied by the currentmonetary  ranges, or perhaps  a small  positive inflation rate  that allowedsome flexibility for policy above the zero bound  on nominal  interest rates.The latter  would imply  an upward adjustment  from the current ranges.Alternatively,  ranges  based on annual  projections  for money  and debtcould help inform the  public about your expected  annual growth  of theseaggregates,  which could be useful,  particularly if you had some  sense ofwhat growth  rates would  begin to raise concerns  for you.  Rapid moneygrowth relative  to the ranges might be  one factor you  could cite inexplaining  a policy tightening,  particularly if it were preemptive in nature.Such projection-based  ranges would also be closer to the spirit of thereporting  mandated by Congress.  Projection-based  ranges  need not belinked to any greater emphasis on the monetary and debt aggregates  inpolicymaking.  The  Committee  could make clear to the public that theforecast  ranges were  not at all policy targets  and perhaps  go even  further tostate  that no additional  weight on  the aggregates  was  intended by a return  toprojection-based  ranges.  On the  other hand, retaining price stability rangesfor the monetary  aggregates  does  not preclude  your giving them moreattention  in policymaking.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions?  No questions!  I  guess you  created  somesort of record around  here.6/30-7/1/98Let me just give my  impression of this policy  issue.  We currently have  a set  of targetsthat we believe  encompass monetary growth  under conditions of price  stability, and we have  hadthose targets  for a considerable  period of time.  The moment  we change  them is the moment  weessentially will be  saying that price stability was  a good idea, but let us  be a little  more flexible.I feel  very uncomfortable  with that.  I think that until we really perceive  a change in the role ofthe aggregates  and we  decide that our policy  actions are  likely to be reflective of their behavior,staying where we are is not a bad idea.  Interpreting what the money supply is doing in thecontext of a range that we stipulate as  a price stability range  has a certain  meaning that in  onesense may even  be superior to  our targeting the expected  growth numbers  and making ajudgment about whether  our forecast  is good  or bad.  Our forecast  is far less important in  abroader sense than  the range that is consistent with price stability.  We  have fallen  into a patternof setting the latter  sort of ranges  for the monetary  aggregates,  which frankly is not a bad idea.In my view, we should consider  very seriously the possible  advantages  of any move away fromthose ranges  because once we do so, we  are going to open up a whole set of new issues that wewill  have to address.  I'm not sure we have as yet arrived  at a  point where we  as  a group feelreasonably confident  about the  stability or predictability of the  monetary aggregates,  at least asfar as I can judge from our discussions.I meant  to ask a question before  I got into my impression  of our use of these targets.Your data show,  as  we  have seen before, that the recent acceleration  in M2 growth may merelyreflect a reversion  of velocity to normal.  Given that we had  not previously seen  that sort ofvelocity  behavior since  1992--your  actual versus  calculated velocity was going straight upstarting in  1993  but it now  seems to have turned around--would  the turnaround in  fact be  anecessary condition to restore  the previous  relationship?6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR. WHITESELL.  Absolutely,  and that is what that graph  shows.  We  maysometimes  be in danger of trying  to overinterpret  wiggles in money  demand.  There does seem tobe some  tendency over time for money demand  to return  to levels  estimated  by opportunitycosts,  aside from the periods where we have had major shifts.  Instead of breaking  past historyinto subperiods,  we alternatively  have  estimated money demand  over a time frame--1964through  1988--that has  a very  gentle uptrend in M2 velocity.  It could be that over long stretchesof time we have had some  substitution out of monetary assets  into alternative  investments  that isreflected in rising velocity.  When  the increased availability of bond and stock mutual  fundsbecame very  apparent to households  in the early  1990s, especially  with  a steep  yield curve  at thattime, there was a  burst of substitution  out of monetary assets.  It seems that that phenomenon hasstabilized  over the last few  years, and there  has not been  what we had feared  would be  acontinuing  substitution back  and forth between  bond and stock mutual funds  and monetaryassets.  Of course, the  stock market has not really been  fully tested yet for that result.  It doesseem to be the case that the velocity of M2 is returning to the same  type of relationship toopportunity costs  that it had in previous periods.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would presume  that the  staff forecast,  which I do notsee  on this chart,  is in effect going back to assuming  a type  of relationship  between  opportunitycosts  and velocity that prevailed  earlier.  Is that correct?

[SECTION]

MR.  WHITESELL.  To some extent, I would  say yes.  Obviously,  we do not have--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The  staff forecast  would have to take account of variousnew  variables including  mutual funds,  since  sometimes  they work and sometimes  they do not, orincorporate "fudge"  factors.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR. WHITESELL.  The staff forecast actually  is in the  first two columns of the  lasttable.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  don't see it relative to your calculated values.  In otherwords, these  charts are based on models.

[SECTION]

MR.  WHITESELL.  Right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  What I do not see here is  how the  forecasts relate to thevelocities  and the deviations  of V2 from a  simple relationship with opportunity  costs.  Is theforecast  going  back to the  zero deviation  from opportunity  cost on Chart 5?

[SECTION]

MR. WHITESELL.  Projected  M2 growth  continues to  be slightly above nominalGDP growth  so velocity  would be edging downward in  1999  as well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  But  will the  gap reach zero?

[SECTION]

MR. WHITESELL.  I'm not  sure if it exactly hits the opportunity cost line.Obviously, we are projecting  that the  opportunity cost  itself will  be flat.  I'm not sure wherevelocity exactly hits on a level  basis, but it gets very close  to that opportunity cost estimate.  Wehad some special factors affecting  M2 over the  first half of this year.  We had mortgagerefinancing  effects, which  boosted M2 growth.  We had  very strong tax payments  in the  secondquarter that also provided a boost to M2.  Those factors  will unwind  over the second half of theyear, but we  still  are projecting  a velocity decline  this year for the  first time since  1986.  Weanticipate that M2 growth  will be returning to a rate closer to that of GDP next year when thetemporary  effects disappear.  We do try to speculate about portfolio  effects  such as thoseassociated  with shifts in expected rates  of return,  substitution effects,  and possible  wealtheffects--so-called  rebalancing  effects.  There also  could be transactions  effects  associated with6/30-7/1/98high payouts  of capital  gains  and retirements  of equity that will boost M2  growth temporarily,but our knowledge  of these effects  is very  speculative.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree with  your comments  about the ranges.  I, too,would not want to choose the ranges  on the basis of a projection  that is consistent  with a forecast.I would prefer to set them on a basis that  is consistent with price  stability.  I would suggest,though, that that approach  might strongly  support the  choice of alternative  III  because  all theranges in that alternative,  including the  1 to 5 percent range for debt, are intended to beconsistent with price  stability.  As it turns out, the projection for debt suggests that this might bea good time to make the change.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I  am somewhat sympathetic  to PresidentParry's view,  but I think this is a dog that is better left not barking in the night and bringingattention  to the ranges at this time.  We would have  a lot of explaining  to do if we  said that wewere  reducing the debt range  to move even  more in the  direction  of price  stability.  I'm not surethat  opening up that argument  would be very convincing or worth the  trouble.  The move wouldoccur at a time when  most of us are  concerned that, if we  look purely  at the  domestic  economy,the  likelihood is that monetary policy might have  to be tightened.  I think giving a signal  thatclearly would be interpreted  as a weakening  of monetary policy would be a terrible idea.Although  I sympathize with President Parry's view,  I believe we are better  off if we retain thepresent ranges for all the  aggregates.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I'm not sure I understand  what you mean by  "weakening of monetarypolicy."6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  In other words, I would not change the debtrange even though I think you probably are correct  intellectually.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  But if you are reducing the  range, that  is the  opposite  of weakening.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  He meant weakening  debt growth.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Oh,  I see.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I think we  should not make any changes  thatwould increase the monetary ranges, and therefore  the  fine-tuning  of the  debt range--which  isreally  all you  are  suggesting, is it not?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes, just the debt range.  No change to the other  ranges.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I think that would bring attention to the subject thatwe do not need.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Let me  offer an alternative  perspective.  I think that the current  pricestability interpretation  allows  target ranges  for money growth  to be set  independently  of both thecurrent forecast  and projected policy and therefore to be ignored in  the policy process.Switching to a projections  interpretation  is therefore  closely connected  in my view  with a returnof money growth  to a more  important role  in setting monetary policy.  An expanded role,  asnoted  in the Bluebook, need not be  in  the form of a rigid target with policy respondingaggressively to  deviations  of M2  growth from its target.  But an expanded role would at leastsignal  that money  growth would be more important  as an indicator  variable,  and that deviationsof money  growth from a target range would  be one of a number of considerations  that wouldaffect the  course of monetary policy.6/30-7/1/98I look forward to the return  to a projections  interpretation  of the money  growth  rangesfor two  reasons.  First, I believe it is more consistent  with the spirit  of the Humphrey-HawkinsAct.  Second,  I believe it would  increase public  awareness of money growth,  and this could beuseful  at  times in  explaining  the need for  a change in policy.  In particular, this  might make  iteasier to explain  the need for a tightening of monetary policy during  a period when  robusteconomic  growth pushes  money growth above  its target range.The  staff reports  that V2  continues  to perform  as well relative  to its determinants  aswas  the case  before the  deterioration  of such performance  in  the early  1990s.  This progressreport is similar to that made  at virtually every meeting  at which  we have discussed  this topicduring my two years  on the  Committee.  So, the question  is if not now  when?  What additionalhurdles  do we expect M2 to jump through  and over how long  a period before  we  accord it a newrole?  In fact,  the bar  seems  to have  been raised.A  second  question  has been  put in  the discussion  of the Bluebook  for this  meeting.Was  velocity  ever stable  or predictable  enough to justify a more important role?  This, of course,is a relevant  question.  My  assessment  is that money  growth did play  a useful  role earlier and  thatit may, therefore,  be ready to resume  a somewhat  more important  role  going forward.  A  greaterrole for money growth  in the policy process  might be facilitated  both by returning  to aprojections interpretation  of the range  and by the identification of a long-run  target for moneygrowth  consistent  with the Committee's  inflation  target.  We  implicitly  identify such  a targettoday as  the midpoint of the current  money growth  ranges, which  we have interpreted  as beingconsistent  with price  stability.  Many  countries have  either adopted  an  explicit inflation target orhave given  a more  central  role to money  growth  in  policy deliberations,  insuring a nominalanchor for monetary policy  and its communication.6/30-7/1/98If we decide not to adopt  an explicit inflation target,  according  money growth  a moreimportant role in the  policy process  and establishing  a  long-run target  for money growth  wouldbe a natural  alternative.  In considering  the  long-run  target for the money growth rate and indeedin specifying the  numerical  range  under the price stability interpretation,  I think we also need totake into  account the analysis  of the implications  of the zero nominal  interest rate  bound wediscussed  yesterday.  The current price  stability interpretation  of the money  growth ranges  is setwith the midpoint for M2 growth  at 3 percent, corresponding  to about a 1/2 percent inflation ratefor the GDP price index.  If we  decide that the appropriate  long-run  inflation target is trueinflation plus a cushion, then the long-run money growth target  for M2 should be raised.So what about  alternatives I, II, and III?  Alternative  III remains unattractive  despiteits consistency.  It doesn't make sense to move to  alternative  III if the ultimate objective,  as inmy case,  is to move from the  price stability to a projections  interpretation  of the ranges.  Ipersonally am ready  to move to a projections  interpretation  of the ranges, though in this  case thenumerical  ranges  in alternative  II should be adjusted  to make them consistent with  a FOMCconsensus  forecast.  The staff, however, does not have the  necessary information to make theadjustment  because they need  the FOMC's  projections  of short-term interest  rates as well  asnominal  income.Let me  suggest a few  possibilities.  First, it might be  appropriate  for the  Chairman tonote in his upcoming Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony that the  Committee is moving towardpaying somewhat  closer attention  to money  growth, if there is some  agreement here that that isthe case.  Second, perhaps  we could ask the staff to  adjust the alternative II  ranges  to make  themmore consistent with the  Committee's forecast  and for them to think more  about how toaccomplish  this.  Third, perhaps  we should retain the alternative  I ranges at this meeting but keep6/30-7/1/98track of the  adjusted alternative  II ranges  and see how useful  they are relative to forthcomingdevelopments  in M2 as  we think about our policy choices over the months  ahead.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I come  at this issue from  a position  that is opposite from GovernorMeyer's  and closer to yours, Mr. Chairman.  I think that  the value of the  aggregates in terms ofcommunications  focuses on  the long term rather than the short run.  I went back to look at theoriginal language  of the Humphrey-Hawkins  legislation,  and I concluded  that the focus  of thatlanguage is  on communicating the ranges that the  Committee plans for various  aggregates.  Sincethe enactment  of that legislation,  the Committee  has been explaining how  difficult it is to planfor any  of the  aggregates  and how they are affected  by numerous  variables.  It seems  to me thatfor  short periods  of time,  like a half year for 1998  and a  full year for  1999,  we are better offfocusing on our longer-term  goals  rather than trying to project or establish  plans for variablesthat are  subject to an enormous  amount of change,  as evidenced by all the factors  that we  talkedabout earlier.  I think the communications  value of these aggregates  is better if they focus  onlonger-run  objectives.I also  think that by keeping  the ranges  where they are,  we do not lose the  value of M2in our own deliberations.  The point was made earlier that it is widely  recognized  that monetarytargets  are not intermediate  variables.  They are  in the array  of variables that we look at todetermine what is going on.  We may be  able to look at them with more confidence  now thatrelationships  seem to have  stabilized  a little.  That is a good thing.  But that does not mean thatwe have  to change  these ranges just because we are  looking at them with  somewhat  moreseriousness  and perhaps  using them to a greater  extent than we did before.6/30-7/1/98I think the communications  value of these  is exactly the way you put it.  I could gowith either alternative  I or alternative  III.  My inclination  is to stay where we are.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Poole.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  My reading of the ranges in recent  years is that they are almostcompletely ignored  by the public  primarily because  the financial  markets realize that moneygrowth  does not play an essential  role in the Committee's  deliberations  on the course  of policy.That was my perception  when I became a member  of this  Committee.  I think the ranges canserve a useful function  in conveying our attitude  about a policy on inflation in the long run.  Iwould leave it completely  to the Chairman  as to how  he believes  he can  most effectively use thisopportunity to convey  the Committee's  views.  I certainly  share  the view that a  move toalternative II would be  very unfortunate  because I think it would  be read in  the context of somerelaxation  of our concern  about inflation.  The question as  to whether we  have  alternative  I oralternative III or III-A or something else along those  lines, I would leave completely  to theChairman's  discretion to choose whatever  he thinks he could  use most effectively  in  conveyingour views.I, of course,  have some  sympathy with Larry  Meyer's statement  that the aggregatesshould play  a more important role in our policymaking.  That is certainly  my view.  But I thinkthe Committee has to get  there first in terms of our actual  use of aggregates  in the making ofpolicy before we  announce  to the world that that is what  we are  doing.  So, although  I have  a lotof sympathy with that approach  to policy, I  don't think it would be  a good idea to make theannouncement  and then  not carry through  on it.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree with the way  you have presented this.  I donot think we should change the ranges  for the  monetary aggregates  nor do I think we  should  goto alternative  III.  As  you said, we backed into a  situation where  the ranges emphasize  ourcommitment  to price  stability and that approach  is  serving  us well  at this point.  Therefore, Iwould change the ranges only if for some reason they  stop serving  us well, or as President Poolesaid, if we  start using money growth in a serious  way  for policy purposes.  Then,  I think it wouldbe  desirable for us to increase public  awareness  of money  growth.  But at this point, I do notthink we should make  any change.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I am sympathetic  to the position that you  laid out initially, Mr.Chairman,  and while there  is some  intellectual  case for changing  the debt range, I do not think itis worth the effort at this point.  I therefore  would be for keeping the ranges as  they are.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  A year ago  at this meeting, I felt  1 to 5percent was the right M2 range for  1998,  given an economy  operating  at most people's notion  offull employment,  and I still think that.  A year ago, I thought that if money  growth  was coming inabove the  1 to 5 percent range, repeating  the experience  of late  1996,  we should be  adjusting thelevel of the funds rate,  and I still think that.  I thought a year ago  that if money growth  wascoming in  above  the staff projections for late  1997  and the first half of 1998,  it would be tellingus that nominal  income  growth  was exceeding  their GDP forecast, that there was an  error in theGDP forecast.  I still think that.  So, I still think that the  1 to 5 percent M2 range  was right, isright,  and it tells us that policy is not appropriately  calibrated.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stern.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, favor what is being called  the pricestability  approach  to these  ranges,  so alternative  I is certainly  fine with me.  It seems to me thatat  the abstract  level, there  is a potential problem  with going to  something like  alternative  II.  Thatis, if we  allow for the normal  lags between  money  and nominal  GDP or money and  inflation, wemight inadvertently  set ourselves up for a situation  where we would be  prepared to  tolerate oraccommodate  or perhaps  even produce  more inflation than we wanted in the future  as  aconsequence  of raising those ranges.  So, at the  abstract  level, I would not be comfortable  withthat.At the  practical level,  if we were  to raise the  ranges, that might be seen as acceptablein the unusual  situation  where  we would  explain that inflation had been  low.  It is certainly  ourperception  that the  public views inflation  as being low.  But to  say that inflation  will be  low  andtherefore  we  are  going to  raise the money  ranges just does not intuitively make any sense to  me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  So unintuitively it does?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Could I just point out that the Committee  is accepting  that view  in itspolicy  decisions.  Are  you  saying  you don't want to communicate  that to  Congress because  wewill not  look disciplined  enough?

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I'm sorry, I didn't follow.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  The price stability  range is not the range we are aiming for next year.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Maybe  we  are!

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I guess  part of my view  of this,  Larry, is that I don't think we have theability to be  all that precise  in forecasting  M2 or any of these other variables.  We just are notthat precise.  I am not troubled  by two facts.  One  fact that does not trouble  me is that next year'sprojection  of 4 percent M2 growth is not right in the  center of our range.  I would not be6/30-7/1/98astonished  if M2  wound up growing 3 percent  next year, say,  as opposed to  4 percent.  But alsowe have not had any  trouble explaining those ranges  to Congress in recent  years.  I'm not evensure the issue has come  up in recent years,  but we certainly  haven't had any problem when  it hascome up in explaining  why money growth  deviated  from the ranges.  Congress seems  to havebeen fully satisfied with those explanations,  at least as  best I can read the  situation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree  that we should let sleeping dogs lie as far asthese ranges  are concerned.  I would not disturb them.  I have  long believed, though, that weshould keep these monetary  aggregates  alive for possible future use.  When I look at Chart 4,especially the  southeast corner that shows  the relationship  between  the opportunity cost and V2in recent years,  I am somewhat  surprised at how close the relationship  has been.  I lived throughthose years  and I don't recall  being aware  that  it was behaving  so well.  I wonder if that may be aresult of some revisions  of the money  numbers or something like that.  I  agree with PresidentPoole who  said that we should use the aggregates  in our policy before  we tell the public that weare using them in that way.  But if the relationship  stays  as close  as it appears  to be in that  graph,I think that (1) we  should be paying more attention  to the  aggregates  in  our policy and  (2)  weshould occasionally refer  to them publicly because there will  come a  time when the best way toexplain what we are doing will be in terms of the growth  of the aggregates.  We don't  alwayswant to have to say that  we think interest rates should be higher.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  In every  presentation of monetary policy that I havemade  to the Congress,  I have had some  reference  to the money  supply for exactly that reason, tokeep the aggregates  alive.  We do not want to shift back  to some emphasis  on the aggregates  andhave somebody ask where  that came  from.  In my recent  testimony before  the Joint Economic6/30-7/1/98Committee, I commented  that the pickup in M2 growth had  our attention  even  though we  did notyet feel comfortable  about the forecasting  capability or indicator  capability  of M2.  After all, weare the central  bank.  What we produce  is money  supply.

[SECTION]

MR.  MCTEER.  When  I read the financial  press, though,  I get the  impression thatnobody thinks  we  are looking at M2.  The reporting is  all in  terms of other things.  So, I do notthink that the  aggregates  have broken  through  to the  consciousness  of the financial writers.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I would join those of you who argueagainst making  any changes  in the  current ranges.  Presidents  Minehan and Poole made thearguments  the way I probably would  have made them.  I  will repeat only one of those arguments,and that is that I do  not see anything  about the current  construct that takes  away our ability togive whatever weight we wish to  give to  the aggregates  we have selected for our ranges.  In fact,I would argue that having money  growth trending  above what we consider to  be the  pricestability ranges  keeps the issue in front  of us to a greater extent than would adjusting ranges  to fitexperience.  So,  I very strongly prefer  retaining the  current monetary growth  ranges,  and I wouldnot tinker at the  current time with the range  for debt.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  I agree with President Guynn.  I thinkit is very  important for us to keep track of what ranges  are consistent with  our views of long-termprice stability.  That does  allow  those of us who are focused on  them  to remind the rest of us thatwe are experiencing  above trend  growth.  I think that actually  provides  for a useful  discipline.  Ialso took note,  as did President McTeer,  of the  southeast corner of Chart 4 that indicates  thatstability may be returning to these  relationships.  For me, that provides  a little hope that there6/30-7/1/98might be some  increased  discipline in those ranges and  therefore all the  more reason to keepthem  alive.  So, I would not change them  right now.  I would keep the monetary  growth rangesfocused on long-run  price  stability,  and I look forward  to a day when we might start to use themmore seriously in our deliberations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I, too, believe in  the price  stability approach  for settingthe long-run ranges.  In my view, there  continues  to be a long-term relationship between  moneygrowth and inflation,  and I think we will be returning  to  the use of money  aggregates  in the notvery distant future.  Therefore,  I would support either alternative  I or alternative  III.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, I  also would not make a  change now in the ranges foreither of the two time periods.  In the case  of the second half of 1998,  I  agree with PresidentMinehan  that the  Humphrey-Hawkins  Act primarily  focuses  on what the Committee  plans  for theaggregates.  That  implies that we  are setting ourselves  a benchmark.  To change the ranges in themiddle of the year would  be to destroy the value  of that benchmark and fuzz up the reasons whyit was adopted. In the case of making  a change for the year ahead  six months in  advance,  areason  for doing that might be that the  Committee wanted to signal  a major change  that wasahead.  And we may--I emphasize  may--have  a candidate  for such a change here if we want tosend a  signal that the aggregates  are now much  more  on the front burner than they have  been.But I  would say that if such  a signal is  desired, it might be better approached by developing  somekind of information release  and having the Committee  debate it and perhaps  adopt it, rather  thansimply changing the ranges  at this  meeting.  I  think a change  at this point could prove to becounterproductive.6/30-7/1/98

MS.  RIVLIN.  I, too, concur with  keeping the ranges where they are.  The fact is thatwe do look at the  money supply  numbers  and we discuss them along with a lot  of other variables,but in my time on this  Committee we  have not really used them to set policy.  I would need  a lotof convincing to believe that we  should.  That leaves  me, of course,  with some sympathy  for theMeyer projections  approach,  but I come  out thinking  that leaving well  enough alone is the bestpolicy.

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also am opposed  to changing theranges and interpreting  the  ranges  as goals.  I would retain  alternative  I, but I would point outthat these  are stochastic  goals and they involve  relationships.  For those of you who aretremendously influenced  by the bottom  panel of Chart 4, relationships  do come  and go.  I wouldlike to put in a plug that if we ever do  change these ranges,  I think we should put on the  table thenotion that I tried last time  of widening them.  But for now, I'm happy to stick with alternative  I.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, I strongly agree  with your position.  My  mainfocus  is on M2 rather than M3  and the debt aggregate.  Like others,  I think the current  1 to  5percent  range for M2  plays a couple of critical  roles.  First, I am  very strongly of the view that itclearly signals  our ongoing  commitment  to price  stability.  In fact,  one might argue that thisrange is the only formal nominal  anchor that we have.  I think it also provides  an early warningsystem when actual  money growth  begins to  deviate on the upside  as it has recently.  It helps tosignal that.  So, in a  sense it holds our feet to the  fire.  I think Bob Parry  has a point.  I certainly6/30-7/1/98would not object  to going to alternative III, but  I guess the disadvantages  of making  a changewith the questions that might raise  probably would  lead me to continue  to prefer  alternative  I.One other point I  would make is in the context  of the possibility that we may want touse the aggregates  in a more  operational  way  going forward.  The Bluebook does  not have analternative  now that shows  what we would have to do to get back into  the  1 to 5  percent M2range by the end of the year, and it might make sense just as a starting point to have  somethinglike  that in the list of alternatives.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It appears that  there is fairly general  consensus for nochange,  which is alternative I.  Would you read the  language encompassing  that alternative?

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  That  will be from page  22 of the Bluebook.  The first sentence  isthe usual general  sentence  on the goals  of the Committee:  "The Federal Open MarketCommittee seeks  monetary and financial conditions  that will foster price  stability  and promotesustainable growth in output.  In furtherance  of these  objectives,  the Committee  reaffirmed  at thismeeting the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3  of 1 to 5 percent  and2 to 6 percent respectively,  measured  from the fourth quarter of 1997  to the  fourth quarter of1998."  Then, skipping beyond the bracketed  sentence:  "The  range for growth of total domesticnonfinancial  debt was maintained  at 3  to 7 percent.  For 1999,  the Committee  agreed  on tentativeranges  for monetary growth measured  from the fourth quarter of 1998  to the fourth quarter of1999 of 1 to 5 percent  for M2  and 2 to 6 percent for M3.  The Committee  provisionally set theassociated  range for growth of total domestic  nonfinancial  debt at 3 to 7 percent for  1999.  Thebehavior  of the monetary aggregates  will continue to be  evaluated  in the light of progress  towardprice level  stability, movements  in their velocities,  and developments  in the economy andfinancial  markets."6/30-7/1/98

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Mr. Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The long-run  simulationsshown  on  Chart 2 following  page  9 of the  Bluebook provide one way ofplacing the Committee's  short-run  policy decision in  a longer-term strategicperspective.  4/  The solid lines show a baseline  extension  of the Greenbookforecast for ten more  years,  along which the  economy  makes a reasonablysmooth transition to the  steady state implied by the staff model.With the  current nominal  federal funds  rate, shown in  the upper leftpanel, held in place through  the year  2000, real  GDP growth--notshown--remains  below  the growth  of its potential just long enough  for theunemployment rate, in the middle  panel, to return  to the  staff estimate of theNAIRU of 5.4 percent  by late  2001.  During the interim,  inflation in thelower panel--as measured  by the  core PCE price index--gradually  rises to a2-1/4 percent  pace, which  is maintained  thereafter.  During this time, the  risein  inflation  combined with the steady nominal  federal  funds rate causes thereal  funds rate,  in the upper right panel,  to edge lower.  A  declining realfederal  funds  rate  is consistent  with rising unemployment  as  the effects  of4/  A copy of the chart  is appended  to the transcript.  (Appendix  4)6/30-7/1/98the earlier increase  in equity prices  on  consumption  abate,  as investmentspending  throttles back,  and  as  the trade  deficit continues  to widen.Once inflation levels  off in 2001,  the process  of declining  real federalfunds rates  is continued  through  very gradual  policy easings  of the nominalfederal  funds  rate.  The  real funds rate  stays  on a gentle  downward glidepath toward  the long-run equilibrium real  interest rate of 2-1/2 percentembedded in the  staff model.The  dotted lines convey  the effects of a tighter stance  of monetarypolicy in the near term that is designed  to achieve  eventual  price stability.By the end of this  simulation, inflation has  been reduced  to 3/4 percent,  onlya bit above  the assumed  remaining measurement  bias.  To achieve  thisresult, the nominal federal  funds rate is raised to a  little more  than 6 percentby late this  year, and is held there  through the  end of next  year.  The boost tothe real  federal funds  rate  depresses  real GDP  growth enough to raise theunemployment  rate  to a bit above  6 percent in 2002.  Thereafter,  theunemployment  rate  can be  gradually returned  to the NAIRU.The Committee  could view  the baseline  simulation as  a successfulstrategy.  With 1/4  percentage  point of the  updrift in underlying  inflationoffset next year by the further  methodological  improvements  assumed in theGreenbook,  the measured  core rate  ends up no higher than the rateprevailing  early  last year.  If the Committee  could accept this inflationoutcome  and also  views the extended  staff forecast as  plausible  in terms of a"best  guess,"  it may be inclined to stand pat on policy for some  time, asunder alternative  B,  at least until  the economic  outlook  starts  to divergefrom  this baseline  scenario.If the Committee  were dissatisfied  with the prospect of a reversal  ofsome of the recent  deceleration in prices, it might be inclined to tighten inthe near future, perhaps  at the current meeting.  The 25 basis point rise in thefederal  funds rate  of alternative C  in the  Bluebook would be a halfwayhouse along  the road to the increase of around 50 basis points thatcharacterizes  the tighter strategy.Of course, both simulations  could be viewed  as based on an overlysanguine  set of longer-run  structural  relationships  and temporary factors.  Aparticularly obvious risk that  would add weight to the  case for a policytightening is  that the staff has underestimated  likely inflation  pressures.  Therecent upside surprise to CPI and PPI inflation, despite  softer than  expectedoil  and non-oil  import prices,  may be an  early warning that the staff hasgone too far in lowering its estimate  of the NAIRU and in raising itsestimates of the growth in trend productivity  and potential  output.  As forthe  actual unemployment  rate,  the lower than  predicted May reportconfirmed a 4-1/4 percent jumping-off point, well below  any plausible6/30-7/1/98estimate of the NAIRU.  And the unemployment  rate would  stay lower thanin the baseline  if the downshifting  of spending to  a sustained sub-par pace,which  the staff considers  to be now in train, does not  in fact eventuate.After all, financial  conditions  remain  accommodative  and stock prices haveshown remarkable  resilience  to adverse  earnings  reports.In case the  Committee foresees  either a higher NAIRU  or strongeraggregate demand,  it might anticipate that a funds rate  path  something likethe one in the tighter strategy would  be necessary over time just to producethe  resource  pressures  and inflation outcomes  of the  baseline. Tracing outthe  assumed path for the funds rate in the tighter strategy  would requirestarting to tighten policy fairly soon,  if not at the  current meeting.  If theCommittee  saw a higher funds rate  as  being necessary in the  not-too-distantfuture,  then  the longer tightening action were  delayed, the  more aggressivewould  the  subsequent tightening have to be.  Indeed,  based on this policyoutlook, a tightening  at this  meeting could be  defended  as the best  way tominimize  the harm done to emerging market  economies  in Asia andelsewhere;  by keeping domestic  inflation  relatively low, such  a move todaywould  limit the extent of future interest rate  increases.The Committee  instead  may view the recent deteriorating  situation inAsia as posing a  serious enough  downside risk to the  U.S. economic  outlookto counsel against any monetary  policy firming  for some time.  If anything,this risk to the outlook has become more prominent  over the intermeetingperiod, as  the lower tail  of the probability  distribution for Asiandevelopments  and  possible contagion to non-Asian  emerging marketeconomies  seems to  have  gotten fatter  of late.  To  be sure, the  staff has madesignificant adjustments  to its baseline  forecast in reaction to the  recentdisappointing  news, as Peter Hooper noted.  But the Committee  still  may bemore apprehensive  than before about unanticipated  adverse  impacts on  theperformance  of the U.S. trade  sector, which  would directly damp  aggregatedemand, resource  utilization,  and inflation pressures  in this country.  AsPeter's  more pessimistic  Asia scenario  also noted,  worse  than expectedAsian developments  could well  be accompanied  by continued  dollarappreciation  and by extended further declines  in commodity and otherimport  prices,  which would further damp U.S.  inflation pressures.  Andthese  downside risks  to developments  abroad and in  the United States  wouldonly be heightened  by a tightening in U.S.  monetary policy  at this meeting.In particular,  an increase  in the federal  funds rate today  would catchrates across  the maturity spectrum.  Such a rate  increase  would be  enlargedto  the extent the policy tightening were  perceived  to reflect a FederalReserve judgment that inflationary  pressures  are stronger  than previouslyrecognized,  hence raising  the odds of further tightening actions  down theroad.  While the inflation premium  in interest rates might rise, real interest6/30-7/1/98rates would increase  as well, and  the rise in real  rates  would make U.S.  debtinstruments more  attractive  relative to those abroad,  thereby  tending tostrengthen the exchange  value of the dollar.  The  associated  decline  in  thevalue of the yen  and other Asian  currencies  might be especially troubling tothe authorities  of China  and Hong  Kong, whose  currencies  are fixed relativeto the dollar,  and contribute  to further instability in the Asian region.Given the relative likelihood  of the main risks in the domestic andforeign  outlook, together  with the relative costs to the United States if theyoccur,  the Committee  may conclude  that standing pat continues to makesense.  If so, the Committee  would be  balancing  the not unlikely probabilityof a somewhat  worse  inflation outcome  than in the Greenbook  against thesmaller, but growing  and perhaps more  damaging,  possibility of a meltdownin Asia.  The Committee's previous  decisions to  await more information  toclarify macroeconomic  trends both here and abroad  seem to have paid off todate.  The Committee  may not yet see  any compelling new  considerationthat  would induce it to change.As for the choice  of the tilt to the  directive, the enlarged risk of moresurprising bad news  from Asia may be seen  as warranting  a return  to anunbiased  directive.  Alternatively,  the Committee  may prefer to maintain thetilt toward tightening on the grounds  that the threat  of faster inflation  alsohas intensified considering  the recent stronger than  expected  incoming dataon consumer prices  and employment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions for David Lindsey?  If not, letme start.For months,  we have been  concerned with weighing the effects  of strong excessdomestic  demand, that  some may have seen  as  accelerating,  against those  of a  deterioratinginternational  environment.  A number  of you  commented  yesterday  that the risks on both sidesappear to be escalating.  Clearly,  on the international  side Japan,  the big  factor in  Asia, hasbecome  an increasing concern.  I  will not go into the discussions  we had  yesterday, but there  is  alethargy  of policy analysis  and decisionmaking in  Japan that, despite the evident movement  inrecent days, is still going to grip that country  in  a way  that  I fear will keep it in a  deterioratingcondition.  As I indicated  last night  at the U.K. embassy dinner, Japan's culture of civility makesthe type of harsh actions required to restore balance  in their economic  system exceptionally6/30-7/1/98difficult to  undertake.  I am  not sure  what they are going to announce  tomorrow  with respect  tobanking reform or the  broader package,  but it is very likely to be less than  many presscommentaries,  especially in  Japan,  have suggested  is needed.  This workout  is going to be farslower and far more difficult for Japan  than many have  assumed, and perhaps  it is not an accidentthat the Japan  premium,  instead  of going down in the context  of the  somewhat better newsreports, has gone up.  We  have an  800-pound gorilla  problem if ever there  was one, and it wouldbe quite  disturbing if Japan  got into a worse financial  situation.Conditions in the  rest of Asia clearly  are deteriorating  further, and most recently thedeterioration  has  spread to Hong Kong and Singapore.  The problem is that the  Asian contagionis obviously  engulfing other areas  of the world.  Russia is at the edge of financial collapse  at thisstage.  How  they are going to  get themselves  out of that is going to be a very interestingphenomenon  to watch,  but I believe it is a matter of weeks  before the  issue is going to have to beresolved  one way or the  other.  Latin America is a little shaky.  Brazil,  as  you know, has beenexperiencing  some difficulties.  Now  that President Cardoso appears to be in a neck-and-neckrace  with Mr. Lula, the left wing  populist  who has run against  him in the  past, there  is concernthat policy may not be as  sound  as it  should be to restore a semblance  of balance in  thatcountry's  economy.  Argentina,  as well  as  it is doing, is also  in some difficulty, especially  withregard to its balance  of payments.  Their imports  are very strong  as  a consequence  of a veryrobust and frankly  quite successful  economy.The falling  price of oil, which  obviously has been  a major factor in the Russiansituation,  also  is having an  adverse impact on Mexico,  where the  budget problems are  quitedifficult.  The lower price of oil  also is having  an effect  in Venezuela  and elsewhere.  No onementioned  the Middle East, but  if one  looks at the  financial and budget  implications of the6/30-7/1/98reduction  in the price of oil for some  of the Gulf states, though  it is not something  ofinternational  concern,  it is part  of a whole  cloth.The danger  of a wider world  financial  crisis,  while still very  small, has risen beyondthe point of being de minimis.  None  of us has ever experienced  anything like that.  Our parentsdid.  I'm not sure  that it is something  we know how to forecast.  We have learned, if we  havelearned nothing else  from Asia, that forecasting  financial  implosions and vicious cycles  isvirtually impossible.  We can merely look at a structure  that  seems  to be somewhat  shabby, but itimpossible  to project  whether that will  fall in on  itself or begin to  stabilize.  All of our modelscall for stabilization,  but that is  because of the way  we build them.  They  are essentiallyequilibrium-seeking  models,  and we cannot effectively  model vicious  cycles or financialimplosions.  A financial  crisis  in these countries  is a mildly scary prospect  on the horizon  for theUnited States,  but it still has, by any measure  that I know  of, a relatively small probability  ofoccurrence  though perhaps  not quite de  minimis.The impact of the  Asian situation  on the United States,  while  more than we  expected,is really  two-pronged.  In  an arithmetical  sense  GDP falls  when  we get a larger trade deficit.  AsBill Poole  insists, the word  "arithmetical"  should be put in there.  Another  factor offsets thiseffect in  part in that the deterioration in Asia clearly has altered  portfolio preferences  in favor ofthe U.S. dollar and in favor of investment in the United States.  One must presume  that part ofthe decline  in long-term interest  rates is a  safe  haven effect,  a reflection  of the  same forcescoming out of Asia that are pulling down our net exports.  The net effect  of Asian  developmentson  the U.S.  economy is  therefore somewhat  less than the gross direct effect.  The effects  of theAsian difficulties  on U.S.  financial  markets  have  augmented  the virtuous  cycle that has occurredin  the United  States  in the last two or three  years  by contributing  to the  surge in capital6/30-7/1/98investment,  the related  acceleration  in productivity,  and the increase in  stock prices associatedwith expectations  of rising profits  over the longer run.  The consequent  wealth  effect has  spurredconsumption  expenditures,  which in turn  have  increased profitability  and have  raised capitalinvestment  and productivity  and thus fostered  continued  cyclical  expansion.As I indicated  yesterday,  I believe a goodly  part of our failure  to  forecast the extent  ofreal  GDP growth  on the  one hand and the  surprisingly benign  inflation  pattern on the other isarithmetically resolved by our failure  to forecast the  degree of acceleration  in productivity.  Atthe  last meeting, I raised the  issue of whether it was possible, as  suggested  in widespreadanecdotal  reports, for businesses confronted  by the  absence of pricing power and rising laborcosts  to find new capital  investments  seemingly at will  to offset their rising costs  throughincreased productivity.  The notion  that someone can,  at  will, choose  from a stock of potentialinvestments goes  against the  view  we all  share that business firms  always seek to  maximize theireconomic  situation.  Apparently,  of course, they do not.One possibility that I raised at the  last meeting was that the implicit rates  of return  onnew investments  were in  fact rising.  We have  done some work on that since then.  Thepreliminary results  do indicate that when  we try to get estimates of the  real rates  of return oncapital  investment for various vintage  years,  the period  from  1993  forward does  show asignificantly  higher rate of return than in the previous years.  That would be consistent with thenotion that the  synergies that were  developing  as many  different technologies  evolved  andimproved in the  1980s and early  1990s created  the opportunity in recent years  to pick and choosealmost  at will among  various types of technologies  to  get increased productivity,  reduce  laborcosts,  and indeed displace  labor.  If that is in fact occurring,  it does  explain  to a substantial  extentwhy the productivity  numbers are rising.  I might also say  parenthetically  that if we can rely  on6/30-7/1/98these  calculations,  they do say that  we have the ability to translate expected  rates  of return intolong-term  structural  productivity gains,  or at least  into various measures  of structuralproductivity.  At the moment,  while I want  to emphasize  that the results  are quite tentative andthat there are certain features  of this model  that I  am a little uncomfortable  with, the tentativeresults  certainly are consistent with the notion that something different  started to occur in theearly  1990s.  Indeed,  if we look at the big surge in  orders and shipments  of communicationsequipment, it is obvious that we  are looking  at the  synergies  made possible by the  developmentof the laser,  fiber optics,  and the micro chip--[Secretary's  note:  Noises from  someone's  watchheard at this point.]--which  was just making those noises.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think the watch  was  digitally saying  "right on!"[Laughter]  In  any event, if we  look at these rapidly  improving technologies,  they represent theareas  where  all  the  faster than expected  growth  in capital investment  is coming from.  Suchgrowth  is occurring  in communications  equipment, which  has benefited  from a huge  expansionof new technologies  that are  found in  products ranging from cell phones to pagers to equipmentincorporating  a  much higher level of sophistication,  and obviously  we also see it in the wholecomputer area.  So, the data  are beginning  to confirm that something  has been  going on.  Howimportant it is and, far more importantly,  how  long it  will last are significant questions.  I  don'tthink we have  any way of knowing the  answers  to them at this point.  It may well be that wehave run through  a specific  bulge  in available  technologies,  and the  data that we have  are notinconsistent with the notion  that we are  rapidly using up the backlog.  But  we don't know thatwith  any degree  of certainty.  There  is nothing in any of these  analyses  that would promote6/30-7/1/98optimism about  a permanent rise in long-term  trend of structural  productivity  growth.  The dataand analyses  are suggestive  but not much more than that.For the moment,  the data that we have  still indicate  that unit costs  are rising at a  verymodest rate.  Unit labor costs  have picked up  some,  and productivity  gains may be  accelerating.Indeed,  that is what the data for nonfinancial  corporations show,  but compensation  per hour alsois  accelerating.  As I said at the last meeting, I have  some questions about  how much confidencewe can place  on the extraordinarily  benign  behavior of the ECI as  an indicator of underlyingtrends in labor costs.  The ECI is no doubt measuring what it is supposed to measure, namely,  thewage  structure abstracting from the movement of people  into different job classifications.  But itis hard for me to believe that in today's very tight labor markets there are not numerous phonypromotions  for purposes of giving pay increases to selected individuals  within companies,  whichwould be politically  difficult for employers  to give directly.  Yet, that sort of pay increaseobviously will  not show up in a change in  the ECI.  The clear evidence that  such pay increasesare occurring  is the fact that  average compensation  per hour, as best we can judge, is moving upa good deal  faster than the ECI itself.Nonetheless,  I think it is  safe to argue that price  pressures,  while modestlyaccelerating,  are not by any means  overwhelming.  We have been using the core CPI  as ourstandard.  I seriously question  whether that is  the right  statistic for that purpose.  First of all, theincreases  in the  core CPI over the  last three months have averaged  about 2.6 percent  at an annualrate.  That is equal to  the rate we had in  1996.  On  a methodologically  consistent basis, theaverage  increase is closer to  3 percent.  If, however,  we look at the  core PCE, which is a far moresophisticated  way of evaluating what prices  really are doing, the average  for the three  months isstill  under 2  percent or below  where  it was  in  1996.  I do not have the  methodologically6/30-7/1/98consistent number at hand to make the comparison.  It is somewhat higher, obviously, but it isnowhere  near the level  that gives  rise to the type of concern  created by a  focus on the recentacceleration  in the core CPI.  If we take  the analysis a step  further  and go to the GDP chainweight index,  which  includes,  of course, the  prices of capital  goods  that generally  are falling, wesee  an increase in the  1 percent  area.  Inflation  probably  is rising, but not at a rate that one  wouldconsider to  be a matter  of considerable  concern.  So, I think that we can talk ourselves  intobelieving there is more inflation than  in fact  has occurred.I do not deny that all these  indexes  show a pickup from  the latter months of 1997.Were that to continue,  it would set off a number of whistles.  But inflation  is not there yet.  Ithink it is important for us to get  a  good sense  of where we  are as distinct from where we fearinflation  is  going to go.  Very obviously, if a slowdown  in line  with what many of us areprojecting or that the Greenbook  is projecting does  not materialize  and if labor markets  continueto tighten,  as they  have since our last meeting, what is happening  to productivity will beirrelevant.  At some point we are  going to get a  surge in  real wages  beyond  what we are  seeingnow  and the pressures  on prices  are going to be  quite pronounced.As it stands now,  we are  getting  some pressures  on profit margins, most notably in  themanufacturing  area.  The  available data for the second  quarter, which  are fairly rough, suggestthat profit margins  in manufacturing  eased  further after declining in the three previous  quarters.Productivity,  however, is still moving up at a fairly  good pace  in manufacturing.  A goodly partof the weakness in  margins is coming from general price  weakness  rather than  significantincreases  in costs.  But it is obvious that at  some point we may get a very rapid acceleration  ofcompensation  per hour, and costs would be  going through the roof.  At that  stage, what would be6/30-7/1/98happening  to productivity  would be irrelevant.  That prospect  is what we  are all concerned  about,and I think very rightly so.For the moment, there is at least an inkling that the strength  in demand is easing.  ThePurchasing Management's  survey for June, which  was released  about 20 minutes ago I assume,shows a little  more weakness  than the market  expected.  It  is under  50 percent.  New ordersremained weak.  Prices paid continued to  decline.  This  survey has no General Motors  strikeeffect in it because  it was  taken well before  the GM  strike.  Chain store sales,  as  a number of youprobably noticed, turned quite  significantly weak in June.  Sales of light motor vehicles  haveremained quite  strong, but it is hard to assess  the underlying strength  of demand given  the extentand size of the rebates  that were offered.  The presumption  is that motor vehicle  sales  are goingto slip quite significantly  in July from the  current levels.The GM  strike is  a difficult issue to deal  with largely because  strikes  as such nevercause economic weakness.  What they basically do is to create a back-up of demand.  When thatdemand is released  at the end of the  strike,  there often occurs a surge in  demand, includinginventory investment,  that is too  strong and the economy  subsequently falls into a slump.  That isactually what happened  after the very long steel strike  in  1959,  which  created a major contractionin economic  activity in the  second half of that year.  The subsequent  surge in overall  demand ledto  an inventory recession in  1960.  There have  been a number of instances  of that type.  The GMstrike is beginning  to get less than  de minimis,  if I can  use the term I  used before.  It is beginningto look like an important  development.  It obviously is  going to have  a major impact on Juneindustrial  production.  It presumably  is going to  have an impact in July as  well, although  anormal  two-week  shutdown is captured in the  seasonal  for July.  As a consequence,  if the strike6/30-7/1/98is  over before  the  end of July, I assume  it is not going to have so pronounced  an  effect on theindustrial  production  number as in June.Inventory  investment, while very strong, still has not created  any significant evidencethat  firms view their inventories  as excessive  because another statistic in  the purchasingexecutives'  report this morning indicates that there  still is no particular concern among  thepurchasing  managers  in manufacturing  regarding the size of the inventories  held by theircustomers.  By definition,  all  goods are  manufactured--or virtually  all  goods  apart fromagricultural  products--so  that they  are  aware  of customer inventories  in all industries.  However,while there  certainly  is no inventory  overhang,  it is hard to believe that inventory  investment willcontinue  at a $100  billion annual  rate.  To the extent  that it falls well  short of that, which  is whatthe Greenbook is projecting  and what I think is the likely outcome, then the  arithmetic ofproduction  suggests that industrial  production  will remain quite  soft.In  summary, I think I expressed the majority  view, at least  as I heard  it here yesterday,that it is too soon to judge the size  of the Asian  spillover into the United States in  all respects.  Inmy view  at least,  it is too risky to raise the funds rate  at this point.  I think, as David Lindseypointed  out, that the psychological  impacts  on  Asia, Russia, and Latin America could be quiteoutsized  and I would suspect rather destabilizing,  with the ultimate impact on the  United Statespossibly quite  negative.  I do not think we can  make  a real judgment  about  what the probabilitydistribution looks  like.  But it is hard not to suspect that there is, to use Larry  Meyer's  term, asignificant tail  sneaking  out into  the high risk area.  While it does not seem  to be a particularlylarge tail,  if we inadvertently  tighten in an  economy that is already deteriorating,  we couldtrigger a far bigger problem.6/30-7/1/98But having said that, I would note  that the labor markets  continue to tighten.  There isno evidence  of which  I am  aware  which suggests  any  material  change  in that direction.  If themost immediate  evidence  of some slowing in the  expansion  reflects  nothing more than  atemporary  slowdown--a possibility that a number of you have raised and  I think quite rightly--then  I think  we face  a very serious potential  problem of inflationary  pressures emerging  out ofthe  labor market.  If that in fact were to materialize,  I  do not  see how we  could do otherwisethan  to respond.  As a consequence,  I  would propose that if we decide to  stay where  we aretoday, we  at least also  retain an asymmetric  directive  to the upside.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I  am essentially inagreement with  your analysis  and with the  conclusion.  I do have modest differences.  I believethat the risk on  the external  side  is somewhat greater  than you indicated, and  it could materializeeven  sooner than we  have anticipated.  On  the basis  of what  we now  know,  what the LiberalDemocratic  Party is going to  announce  in Japan  on July 2,  which  is coming  on us rather quickly,will  be very  disappointing to the financial  markets.  The  big rally that we  have had in the  yen  andthe  Nikkei  was mainly an end-of-quarter  rally  as of June  30.  Today, when  the Nikkei rallyresumed,  I think the markets  indicated that they  are expecting  far more out of the  announcementon July 2 than  is likely to be there.  Therefore,  the notion,  which I think  is the single biggestproblem,  that the  Japanese government  and its  leading party cannot get their  act together couldbe  on us rather  quickly indeed.I agree that the Russian  situation is extremely  hazardous.  Since one  of the  areas  ofstrength in the  world economy is continental  Europe,  a  serious financial  crisis  in Russia, whichcould  very quickly  turn  into a political  crisis in a nation with lots  of weapons,  could easily undosome  of the confidence that has been restored to continental  Europe in the last year.  I think a6/30-7/1/98severe  worsening of the international  situation  is certainly  not within the range  of the  probable,but I would describe it as  a risk that is distinctly possible.On the domestic  side of the economy,  I agree  very much  with your view, Mr.Chairman, that  we do not know whether  the wonderful productivity  improvement  we areexperiencing  is going to last.  You laid  out the basis  for that  uncertainty  very well  in yourremarks.  I think the  likelihood that wage pressures  are going to burst out is not terribly  great.What would happen in  my view is that in various  pockets of the economy people would  start torealize  that they could  push their employers  to pay higher  wages, but I think that realizationprobably  would spread somewhat  more slowly than  your remarks  suggested.  Therefore,  theprice reaction  might be somewhat  slower as well.  However, clearly  if the domestic economy  isto be looked  at in isolation and one  assumes that the  international  crisis will  not happen,  and wecertainly  all hope it will  not, then  I think we will be  in a situation  in which  the risks to inflationare  sufficiently  great that, although  I agree  we should not change our policy today, anasymmetric  directive  toward tightening is certainly  in order.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I agree with your recommendation  onmaintaining the  federal  funds rate  where it is  today and also on maintaining the bias towardtightening.  I am concerned  about the prospects of an updrift in inflation.  I guess  I fear, perhapsmore than  you do, that the  staff's  forecast for slower expansion  without some policy interventionnow, but I'm afraid those may be  short-lived.  I also think, based on other information  we havereceived from the  staff, that even if there is  an updrift  in productivity,  that may call for a higher6/30-7/1/98funds rate  and not  a lower funds rate  in order to maintain  equilibrium.  So, while  I am optimisticon both  of those scores,  I think the bias toward tightening that  you recommend  is right.However,  in line with what  the Vice  Chair has said, I also  am concerned  about theinternational  component  of the forecast  as  I mentioned  yesterday.  I think the external  situation isnot going to  improve anytime soon.  Therefore, I believe  the wiser course for us at this stage is tosit tight.  I  guess ultimately this is the  least unacceptable  choice, but I think it is also the mostresponsible one.  Therefore,  I would make no change  in either the funds rate or the  asymmetry.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Obviously, I  am delighted with the  staffsupward revisions  in its estimates  of productivity growth  and potential  output growth,  and I willbe even more pleased if future revisions are  also upward to  3,  3-1/4,  or even  3-1/2 percent,  which  Iguess  was the  highest in history.  That would be  absolutely delightful.  I  doubt that we will  see itgo above that and set a new record, but if that happens,  that would be  great!  Nevertheless,  suchproductivity  growth is still  not as rapid  as the growth  of demand, and that  creates  the problemthat we have.  I  also am delighted with the unemployment  rate being at 4.3  percent,  and I hope itcontinues  to go down.  I would like to see it go to 4 percent  or even below  4 percent.  Lowunemployment  helps us to do wonderful  things by providing opportunities  for people.  But it alsosets  a model for the rest  of the  world about what works.  The longer we can  sustain it, the moreimitators  around  the world we  are going to have.  So, I hope we  will not get ourselves  into asituation where we  have to take action.  An  unavoidable  byproduct  would  be a higherunemployment  rate.  It  would be not only bad for us, but also bad  as a model  for the rest of theworld if we found ourselves  faced with having to take such  an action.6/30-7/1/98When I  look  at the Asian  situation,  perhaps Latin America,  and certainly  Russia, Ithink  we should  ease  policy.  Unfortunately,  we do not have the luxury of even considering  thatoption at this time,  and that is too  bad.  Maybe  if nominal  spending growth,  money  growth, andother things over the  last year had been  as forecast  by the staff instead of coming in stronger, theeconomy  might  be more  balanced right now and we might  be able to entertain  that possibility.Or maybe  if we  had responded  earlier to indications  that  spending  growth, domestic  demand,  andmoney  and credit growth  were  coming in  a lot stronger  and the current  account deficit  waswidening,  we might  have had the option  of considering  an easing  sooner.  I think we are  going toneed to ease  for the sake  of the rest of the world.  The  sooner we create  the conditions  within thedomestic  economy  that  will permit us to contemplate  an easing of policy,  the better off we aregoing  to be  and the better  off the world is  going to  be.  Unfortunately,  we  sometimes  have totack;  we sometimes  have  to go in  an opposite  direction  from where  we really  want to go to getthere. I want to be in a  world where  we not only have lower inflation, but where  we have lowerinterest  rates,  rapid economic  growth,  and sustained  low unemployment.  But I think we  areapproaching  a point where we may have  to  go in  a direction  different  from where we  all want tocome out.

MR. BOEHNE.  If there  ever was a time  to hold  steady,  it is now.

Our backs are not to the  wallin that regard and, therefore,  I think the case is  very persuasive  that we  should  stay where  we arewith regard to monetary  policy.6/30-7/1/98As far as  the tilt of the  directive is concerned, I think continuing with the current  tilttoward tightening is appropriate  going forward.  I say that mainly  because  I do not believe weknow enough about whether it would be constructive  to make a change  at this point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, we  clearly are  seeing some weakness now  in someof the  second-quarter  numbers,  but it seems  to me that even though the  growth of final demandis still going  to be well above trend.  We have discussed the  two negative impulses frominventories and net exports,  but as  I said yesterday,  my own feeling is that they are  likely to betemporary.  There is  a very good chance  that they will not have much  lasting effect on the  abovetrend growth in final demand.  Such growth  is an upside  risk, and I think we should take  itseriously  in an environment  in which  labor costs  and the core CPI on a consistently measuredbasis  are rising.I still  think that an increase now in the funds rate would be prudent and could wellincrease the  lifespan of this expansion.  Having said that, I recognize  that for many reasons  thathave been  expressed around this table, this would  not be a convenient time to tighten policysince  we  are likely to  get a weaker-than-expected  GDP number at the end of this month  and thepublic perception  might link whatever  action we might take at this meeting with that number,which would  cause unfortunate problems for us.That sort of constraint  underlies the  need to take advantage  of opportunities  to tightenpolicy when they arise in an environment  like this.  They do not arise very often,  and the  windowof opportunity does not often stay open  very long.  I know people  can disagree  about this, but Ifrankly think we may have missed a couple of opportunities  in the  recent past that might  have6/30-7/1/98served us well.  So, if we  see that the strength  of overall demand  is persisting  as  we go forward,perhaps  as a result of an  improvement  in the Asian  situation,  and we see  a window  ofopportunity,  I believe we  should take  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  there is no question  in my view that we  currentlyface heightened  risks.  On the  downside, the risks discussed during  our lengthy review of theeconomic outlook yesterday  and this morning  stem from developments  in Asia, Russia,  and otherplaces, projections  of declining  inventory investment over the short term, and the possible  impactof reduced profit margins on the stock market.  All  of these downside risks  seem morecompelling  than they were  at the time of our May  meeting, if not scary in some cases.  I think wehave to remember, however, that given  the persisting strength  of the expansion,  we need  some ofthese retarding  influences  to rein in the growth  of the domestic  economy.  We  have forecasted  aslowdown,  and we  are  seeing a slowdown.  It may be  a little larger than  we expected,  but I thinkwe  have to worry  about overreacting  to it in  current circumstances.I believe  the risks on the upside also have increased.  We  are  beginning to see warningsigns of rising inflation.  We  continue to have an  atmosphere  of very  accommodating  financialcosts, and those temporary  influences  may fade  away.  I continue  to believe,  very much likePresident Broaddus,  that we  run a  significant risk of excess demand  whose cumulative effectstighten policy that we should have taken  advantage  of earlier.But I also agree with  you and with the Vice Chairman  that  the timing for a policytightening  move is not favorable  today, especially  as the Japanese  are trying to  work out6/30-7/1/98appropriate  policies  and there  seem to be so  many other potential  developments  that are  hangingin the  balance.  So, I would agree with your proposal,  in some sense reluctantly  because I  thinkour policy may well be behind  the curve as  far as our domestic  economy is  concerned.  I  wouldhope that we can, as  President  Broaddus  has suggested,  find a window  of opportunity when  alittle tightening might be  helpful both for us  and for the  rest of the  world.  In that regard, I wouldretain  the  tilt toward tightening  as well.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman,  the upside  and the downside  risks we face  are muchthe  same as  those we talked  about at our last meeting, but  as a number of us  have  said, they nowseem to be more severe  in both directions.  The domestic  economy has  continued to  show  signsof unsustainable  growth, and we  now have  seen some modest worsening in  inflation readings.However, the international  situation has grown  even more  uncertain  since our last meeting,  and Isaw it firsthand  during  my recent trip to Japan.  I think the chances of a more  severe thananticipated reduction  in our net  exports  appear  to have  increased.I would just add that my experience  in dealing with the  Japanese  government  and theLDP  lead me to believe that they  will not act  quickly  and decisively to deal  with  their problems.Their unique  culture and political processes  are very  powerful,  and they are not likely to changein  the short term.  I believe it will  be a very  long haul.For now,  I think the uncertainties  in the  international  outlook clearly justify waiting.However,  I do think that, on balance, the risks remain  definitely to the upside  and that we  arelikely to have  to tighten this  year.  So, I agree with  your recommendation.

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Your comments  and those  of others  thismorning  and in  yesterday's  discussion  certainly  have  reinforced my sense  that we are seeingsome  signs  of a  slowing  expansion  and can  identify some new, larger downside risks  than wecould at the time of the last meeting.  At the  same time the  slowing in coming quarters  that mostof us are  forecasting for the domestic economy  is far from certain in my mind.  Moderatingdevelopments  have  been in  our forecasts  for a long time without materializing.  If we continue  toget  the kind of strength  we have been experiencing  along with  other indications  that policy maybe too accommodating,  obviously I  too would be concerned  that we are  taking too great  a risk ofan  uptick in inflation.  Until we  get more confirmation  of the  direction in  some key sectors  of thedomestic  economy,  I also would be more comfortable with  an  asymmetrical  directive.  It wouldcontinue  to serve both  as a reminder to  us of the upside risks in the economy  and as a signal toothers that  we are  not interested in giving  back any of the ground that we have  gained  oninflation  over time.  Thank you.

MR. STERN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly share most of the  concerns  youexpressed  and it seems  to me, given  the trends that I believe  are  in place and  at the risk of someoversimplification,  that how things play  out domestically  largely depends  on  what productivity6/30-7/1/98does.  Some outcomes  are going to be  much more favorable  than  others depending onproductivity.  I  don't have  a  strong conviction  on what productivity might do over the next sixquarters,  so I'm left to fall back  on patience.  I think patience  has  served us well  to date.  There isa danger of overstaying  that hand, but at the moment I am prepared  to stick with it and I  supportyour recommendation.

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I agree with  your proposal.  I am willingto wait  and see if the  growth  in domestic  demand  slows and I am mindful  of the internationalsituation,  but I have a couple of comments.  I believe domestic  demand is stronger  than isconsistent  with long-term price stability.  We have  to be very much  aware of that.  My othercomment is that I do not want Japan's paralysis to become  our paralysis  in terms of what is theright thing to do.  I am very mindful  of that.  Yes, we  should wait, but I don't think wenecessarily  should wait until everything  is perfectly clear.  Thank you.

MS.  RIVLIN.  Certainly nothing  is ever going to  be perfectly  clear!  I support  yourrecommendation,  Mr. Chairman.  As I said yesterday,  I think the  staff may be overestimating  thepotential for a slowdown  in  the near term, but I also  am  very worried  about Asia and thepossibility of a general  collapse  in several  foreign countries.  I do not think we know  what wecan do to  avoid that, but we know that raising the  federal funds rate today is not the appropriatemeasure.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In light of the sharp  slowdown  in U.S.economic  growth that  appears  to have taken place  in the second quarter, the increased  potentialfor a  more persistent slowdown  due to the further deterioration  in foreign  economic  activity  andperhaps  especially due to the  substantial  increase  in global risk, I support your recommendationfor no change in policy today.  Nevertheless,  I  remain  quite concerned  about  the risk of inflationgoing forward  due to the very tight labor markets  prevailing today, due to the  continued robuststate  of domestic demand,  and due to uncertainty  about the  degree and the persistence  of aslowdown.  Therefore,  I strongly favor the  asymmetric  directive  as well.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The upside risk appears to have  risen further, as  it probably did ateach of our last  several meetings,  but the downside  risk seems  to have  gone up quite  sharplysince the last meeting to the point that I think the risks, even though  they are both greater thanthey were, are now  relatively balanced.  I guess I  am willing to be a  minority of one in that,while I favor a no change  policy today, I  would suggest a removal  of the bias toward tightening.Obviously,  Asia and the spreading  financial  crisis around the world are the main reason.  In  myview,  the reason is not so much  because  of possible  spillover effects  to the  United States throughthe trade  accounts or whatever.  I don't know  what the spillover is likely to be.  I think that, onbalance,  it has been positive so far.  But we  are  the world's remaining  superpower  and aneconomic  and political  leader in the world.  We often  say that China  has been very  statesmanlikefor promising not to devalue  its currency  under current  circumstances.  I think the circumstancesalso  require that we  not upset the  apple cart.  So, I would agree with your no change proposal,6/30-7/1/98and I would remove the bias.  I was  a lot more  comfortable  saying that before Tom Hoenig  madehis soundbite.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  My concern  is that meeting  after meeting  we  are drifting into a situationthat will  accommodate  higher inflation next year  and the  year after.  Let me start with anassumption  about the policy environment that we are  going to be facing  over the  next fewmeetings through the rest  of this year.  The inflation rate over the remainder of this  year is almostcompletely predetermined.  We don't know what  it's going to be, but whatever it is, it is notgoing to be much  affected  by what we do at this meeting or the next.  However,  what happens tothe inflation  rate is going to make a difference  to the  environment  within which  we are makingour policy  decisions.I am  also quite prepared to assume  that our external  problems or the problems in  othereconomies  are  very likely to be with  us, and I fear they will be with  us for a long time.  Considertwo different  scenarios  for our coming  meetings.  First, suppose that the published  CPI inflationrate remains  low.  That will make  life easy  for us.  We will  have the luxury  of acting or notacting  at any point,  and we can  continue  a policy  of watchful waiting.  But consider scenariotwo.  Suppose that the CPI starts to rise in the  published data  to the 3  to 4 percent range,  which Ithink is certainly well within the  realm of possibility.  Then  we are  going to  be faced with  somevery,  very difficult  decisions.  Assuming the  problems with  Asia and maybe elsewhere  in theworld persist, we are going to be faced  with the  same unpleasant  external  situation but  with theadded pressure of CPI increases  right in  our faces.  I continue to believe that it would be best ifwe were to raise  the funds rate now  rather than to wait for what I think could well  be a moredifficult environment for taking  action  in the future.6/30-7/1/98It is  not obvious to me that a tightening move now is  going to make the situation  inJapan  worse.  What I believe the  Japanese  need to do is  to have  a consistent policy direction  on anumber of fronts, including  a monetary policy that is more expansionary  to end their deflation.Such  a policy in Japan is likely to lead to some further depreciation  of the  yen  against the  dollar,and that is a constraint that the Japanese  feel in part because  of U.S. pressures.  If anappreciation  of the dollar against  the yen is attributed to policy action  here, it may  actually makethe situation easier for Japan.  I don't know.Having said all that, I well understand  the judgment going the other way.  There  arevery tricky issues  in the  international markets  and because  of all the  uncertainties  in the  outlookthat we have discussed, I am happy to support your recommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Gramlich.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Mr. Chairman,  I support your recommendation  and as always  Ithink you have  made  some  interesting points  in  your analysis.  I  would like  to comment  on a fewthings that I heard  around the table.  The first is on Asia.  To put in  a word for something thatJerry Jordan  implied yesterday  and Bill  Poole implied just now,  some  combination  of a reductionin Japanese prices  and the yen  still  seems to be in the cards.  That tilts me a  little more  toward thepessimistic  Asia scenario  that Peter Hooper mentioned  yesterday.The second point is that we have not heard much  about NAIRU  at this meeting, but letme repeat for the record  that  given the slowdown  that I believe  is in the cards  and normaleconometric  uncertainties,  I am not so convinced  that we  are  below NAIRU or at least that wewill  be below  it in a few  months.My next point is on  inflation.  I would like to underline  what you said was  our focuson the core CPI at a  time when there is  a very large difference between  that measure  and the core6/30-7/1/98PCE or the GDP deflator.  If we are going to put things  to study on the  table, I would  like to putthat on the table.  I think there  are some  interesting  issues here.  We see  some acceleration  in  allof the  series, but they are from different levels  and on the whole perhaps  less  worrisome  levels.I would like to support the view  expressed by Al Broaddus that if we see anopportunity for raising the  federal funds rate  and if we become  convinced  that the unemploymentrate  is below NAIRU,  we  should take  advantage of that opportunity.  In taking it, we probablyshould be  thinking about a bigger change in the funds rate than 25  basis points because,  as weknow, these opportunities  do not come along too often.Lastly, I have  some sympathy for what Bob McTeer  said about returning to asymmetric  directive.  I have been mulling over that option,  but in the end I rejected  it because,while it might be consistent  with our current  thinking, basically  added uncertainty is what mightlead  us to symmetry  and until  we know or think we understand  a little more  about the economicsituation, I would not want to attract  attention to the  symmetry issue.  It is to  some extent thesame issue we talked  about this morning with regard to the ranges  for the monetary  aggregates.So, I am  for sitting still  with  the asymmetric  directive,  but I did give some thought to the idea ofshifting to  symmetry that Bob McTeer raised.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Mr. Kohn,  would you lead  us off?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  At the meeting  in March,several  members  suggested  that the Committee  consider  whether someexplanation  should be given  to the public  after each  meeting  when nochange is made  in monetary policy.  Two proposals  were put on the  table atthe March  meeting.  One was to release  the  directive  when  the tilt waschanged  along with a brief explanation.  Another was to release  a  briefstatement  after every meeting  whether  or not the tilt was changed.  DaveLindsey and I came  up with  a number of permutations  and combinations  ofthose proposals.The desire  for more explanation  comes from within the Committee.There  is no real  outside pressure  for more  or earlier release  of information.Committee members  from time to time have wanted  to explain  the basis fora "no change"  decision,  notably when  markets expected  a change  that didnot occur.  Some members  also indicated  that they thought  an explanationwas desirable  when the Committee  felt that  underlying  conditions  were6/30-7/1/98shifting significantly though  not enough  to warrant  a change in policy.  Thatwas  the case in March.  There  also has been a desire  at times to warnan overreaction  because  of the  surprise when  policy tightening or easingactually  occurred.  It may also be that the felt need  to issue  a statement  whenno change  is made is fed in part by the  limited number of actual  changes.The Committee has few  opportunities  to comment on policy considerationsoutside the  two Humphrey-Hawkins  testimonies each  year.The question of how much to announce  and how often  to do so hasbeen  addressed by the Committee  on a number of occasions,  most recentlyin February of 1995.  At that time the Committee  had a report  from asubcommittee headed by Governor Blinder, with  Governor Kelley,President Boehne,  and President Melzer  as members.  The subcommitteerecommended  and the  Committee accepted  what  essentially  is the currentpolicy of announcing  changes  in the  stance of policy.  That  subcommitteerecommendation  included the  possibility of an occasional  explanation  of a"no change"  in policy if there  was a good reason  to provide  such anexplanation,  but it was expected to be rare.  The possibility of an occasionalpublic statement to explain  a  "no change"  policy decision was  announced tothe public at the  time.  The Committee  has shied away from  using thatoption partly on the ground  that members  felt it would be difficult to  do sojust once in a while.  Having done it, there would be  pressures for andexpectations of more frequent  announcements.No one  at the  February 1995  meeting was in  favor of making  anannouncement  after every meeting, although I think Alan  Blinder leaned inthat direction.  More than three years  have passed  since  then, and theCommittee  has had more experience  with announcing  changes,  so it seemsappropriate  for the Committee  to reconsider its policy.In  its discussions of these issues in the  past, the  Committee hasweighed  two broad  considerations.  Here I am drawing on  the February1995 discussion  as  well as  Dave Lindsey's memo  and other information  thatwe  have.  On the one hand, providing more rather than less information  isviewed as  generally better public policy.  It is the responsibility  of a publicagency to explain its activities in  a democratic  society,  and it enhancesaccountability  of that agency.  In addition,  on average  and over time,thinking  about and what its concerns  are.  That is, changes  in market pricesshould tend to stabilize  the economy and help the Committee  to achieve itsgoals.  I think there are two caveats  here.  First, it is not always  easy for theCommittee  to  convey its intentions and concerns.  They  are subject tomisinterpretation,  certainly  an experience  we all have  had from time to time.Second,  volatility may increase if events do not validate  expectations.Moreover,  Committee statements  help to frame press reporting  and press6/30-7/1/98coverage  of policy and  hopefully to educate  the public in that way.Committee statements  or official releases  give you,  the members  of theCommittee,  some  guidance in  your own  statements over intermeetingperiods.  Those  are the positive  aspects.On the other hand, the Committee  has anticipated  drawbacks  to makingadditional  announcements  and releasing  additional  information, especially ifthose  announcements  and information  feed back on the policy process itself,making it more  difficult to reach  the right decision.  In  some of thediscussions  over the  years, the market  reaction itself was  viewed as  apotential  problem  as  well as a  benefit.  The reasoning  was that if theCommittee wanted  to move interest rates,  it would change  policy.  The factthat it had not changed policy suggested  that it did not think conditions  wereright for changing  interest rates.  In 1995  in  particular, several  Committeemembers  expressed concern  that the announcement  itself could lock inin which the market expected  some action  and the Committee  would thenhave to worry  about disappointing those expectations.One question  raised at the time was whether  announcing  a "no  change"including delayed  contingent  changes.  In the  past, the Committee has  fromtime to time made decisions at meetings to change its policy stance  in thenext few days  or weeks  after the meetings if the  data came  in a  certain way.I can recall a  decision  like that in December  1991.  The Committee  did notwant to announce  a  "no change"  decision  and then not be  able to make  achange within  the next few weeks  if the incoming  data were of a certainkind.  That is why  the current announcement  after each  meeting is  phrased"there  is no further announcement"  rather than "the  Committee  has notchanged its policy."The Committee also was concerned that  announcing  symmetries  andasymmetries  could be seen as  a precommitment not  only over theintermeeting period  but for the next meeting  as well.  If the  directive  werereleased, the symmetries  and  asymmetries  would be much moreconsequential,  partly because  of market reactions.  That prospect couldprovoke more dissents and could lead to reduced use of the  symmetries  andasymmetries  because  members would be  concerned about the  marketreactions.  Members commented  at that time that the tilts had contributed topolicy flexibility  and  consensus building, and  they were  concerned  aboutdoing something  that would reduce the use of the tilts in the  policy process.There  also was concern  about the wording  of the press  statement.Members  anticipated  difficulties  in reaching agreement  or consensus,especially  if statements  were forward-looking  or had implications  for futureaction.  It  was not clear what to do about  dissents or contrary views in the6/30-7/1/98announcements.  These are  problems  that arise  for statements  made whenthe  Committee  actually  changes  its policy.  But some  of the  thinking wasthat with no action,  there was  nothing to take the focus  off the wordsthemselves,  and the words might be more important for a statement aboutwhy  the Committee  did not take action,  which  would be examined  more forwhat it implied for the future than  for a statement that explained  somethingthe Committee  had done.  At the  March meeting,  a number of you wereconcerned  that the nuances  of a "no  change"  directive  with  a tilt or changein  the tilt could  not be captured in a short  statement.In  addition to  these pros and cons,  there  are a number of other issuesthat you could think  about in the  process of reaching  this decision  or thatwould need to be  thought about if your disclosure  policy were going tochange.  One question is whether there  are ways of accomplishing theobjective of explaining  a "no change"  decision other than making  anannouncement  after every meeting.  One  possibility obviously  would be  toimplement  the February  1995  decision to issue the occasional  rarestatement.If the  directive  is released, should minutes  be speeded  up to helpexplain  the  directive?  Even if they were  speeded up, the minutes  would stillbe released with a  lag after the  directive, but  at least they would help toexplain  the  Committee's  decision with a shorter lag.  And  should thedirective wording be looked  at again?  The Committee  did look at directivewording  on the  tilts  in August of 1997, just about a year  ago, and you wereunable to reach  a consensus  on any changes.  Another issue is how to treatdissents and alternative  views.A  further concern  might be whether these  issues should be consideredin the broader context  of interactions  of FOMC  members  and staff with  thepublic  and the press.  You have discussed  what is appropriate  and what  isnot  appropriate  to tell outsiders,  but the  guidelines  remain  informal.  Thequestion  is, should  they be codified  or at least discussed again?Finally, if there is a  change in procedures,  how  should this beannounced to the  public?  If you  were to change  something  today, theChairman's Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  would be  a natural  possibility.Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  This is a topic  that has been the  basis for a  lot of discussion from timeto time, and  I think it is  worthwhile to  bring it back and discuss it again  because circumstances6/30-7/1/98change, people's  views change,  and the  Committee's membership  changes.  I would like  toprovide a few  observations  because this is not the first time I have been  through this.I believe  most of us around the table start with a bias  toward giving the public moreinformation.  But I think there are  two basic reasons  why we  should not end up disclosing the tiltor regularly  making statements when  we do not change policy.  They come down in my view tothe quality of the information  that we would be  releasing  and the quality  of the deliberations  thatwe have  around the table.I think it is beneficial  to give the public  a lot of information about monetary  policy,and we do give the public a lot.  But giving  misinformation  is harmful.  As an  illustration, oneonly needs  to look at the ambiguity that surrounds  the tilt.  Markets  do not have a clearunderstanding of what we mean by our "woulds"  and  "mights."  For example,  some  analysts saythat the asymmetry toward tightening that the Committee  adopted  in March  means  membersagree that a rate  hike is more likely than a rate cut.  Others  say the asymmetry  means membersagree  that their  next move will be to raise rates, though the  timing is up  in the  air.  Yet anothergroup says the asymmetry was meant to prepare the  markets to  give the  Committee room to actat today's  meeting  or the  May meeting.  I recall analysts explaining  not too many years  ago thatan  asymmetric  directive  meant that the Committee  had given the Chairman  leeway to changerates  between FOMC meetings,  while symmetry  meant the  Committee had decided to tie theChairman's  hands.  This  ambiguity  is not terribly  important when the tilt is  old news, but Ibelieve  ambiguity about the meaning  of asymmetry  in a current  directive  plants the seeds  ofconsiderable  confusion.Then the issue is whether  we could clear up this  ambiguity.  The problem  is that it ishard to clarify the ambiguity  for the public when  we are not clear about the meaning  of6/30-7/1/98asymmetry among ourselves.  The reason  is that it has meant different  things to differentCommittee members in  different circumstances.  In that kind of situation,  the task of crafting anexplanation  that does not mislead is at best  a challenging one  and the likely  outcome  is that theeffort will end up being an exercise  in frustration  or one that will produce  boilerplate.The second reason for not increasing  the  amount of disclosure  is its effect on thequality of the deliberations.  Quicker and more complete  disclosure  already  has changed  thenature of the Committee's deliberations.  I am for the disclosure  that we  do,  but we should notmislead ourselves  about how it has  changed the  nature  of these proceedings.  I recallparticipating in routine, vigorous,  and freewheeling  debates  in this room before we  decided  torelease transcripts.  Now,  most of us read prepared  remarks about our Districts and the  nationaleconomy and even our comments  on near-term policy sometimes  are crafted  in advance.Prepared statements were the  rare exception  rather  than the rule  until we  started to releasetranscripts.So the issue  is how early  release  of the tilt will  change the nature  of our deliberations.I think it will.  Announcing  the tilt of the  current directive  ultimately will  lead us to avoidasymmetry  altogether.  I think that will eliminate  a consensus-building  tool  that has benefited  ourthe current directive  when we have not decided  to  change policy  immediately inevitably willinvite  more speculation  and even lobbying of individuals  about the timing of our next move.  Isuspect that over time a majority of the Committee  will develop  a preference  for symmetricdirectives just to  avoid these kinds  of announcement  effects.In  most cases when the  Committee has  adopted an  asymmetric  directive,  it has  votedfor no immediate  change in policy.  There  have been  a few times when the  Committee  has6/30-7/1/98adopted an asymmetric  directive along with  a 25  basis point change  in the federal  funds rate.But in most cases,  perhaps  all, the asymmetric  directive  helped build a larger majority forconsensus.  I think consensus  is useful, particularly,  as we discussed  last night  at the U.K.embassy dinner,  because what has evolved  is a collective  responsibility  and accountability forthis Committee rather than the individual responsibility that has developed  in England.  I  had thesense last night that they wished they were  closer to us than where  they are now.I think  we send  a louder, stronger  message when  we do change  the funds rate if we havethis consensus-building,  collective-accountability  approach.  If we do not have the asymmetryavailable  as  part of our directives,  I think we will see more  8 to 4 votes  and 7  to 5 votes.  Is thatbad?  Maybe not.  But when I came  away  from the  discussion last night, I sensed that we arebetter  off the way we do things here.The bottom line  is that releasing  the tilt in the current directive  is not likely to give thepublic much useful  information  about monetary  policy, but it is  likely to reduce the quality ofour  deliberations  and our ability to build a consensus.That leads to the issue of releasing  a statement  after all meetings  in which we  do notchange the existing policy stance but without identifying the  tilt in the directive.  I believe such  astatement  would fairly quickly lead to demands to identify the tilt.  We cannot avoid making thetilt known for very  long if we start to make regular announcements.  What would happen  if wedid not announce the tilt is that outside  observers would pore  over every word in theannouncement  in an effort to determine whether  there is  a tilt or not.  So, I think the two gotogether.I personally believe  that we have  found about the right balance  for now between  thepublic's right to know  and the public's interest in  having  a high-quality decisionmaking  process6/30-7/1/98for monetary  policy.  No  tradeoff is perfect, but I think that what we have  works rather well  mostof the  time.  In the rare  exceptions  when we  might want to provide  some information  about thetilt and our policy direction or to prepare  the  markets for a near-term  policy change,  I think wehave  ample vehicles  to do that that are consistent with our collective  accountability,  notably thevoice of the Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That was  a very thoughtful evaluation  and historicalreview.  On the basis  of my own  experience,  I come out at the  same place.  I have gone  aroundand around on this issue  and I keep ending up in the  same spot for exactly the reasons Ed Boehnementioned.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I strongly  agree with  President Boehne,  and betweenwhat you  and he just said, you have  preempted the  substance of the statement that I wanted tomake.  But if you will indulge  me, I would like to go  ahead and try to expand  on what EdBoehne said.I did sit  on that earlier subcommittee,  as  Don mentioned, and I strongly  supported thechanges  that we adopted  in early  1995.  But I would have  a very strong  concern  about makingfurther  changes such  as those that are  discussed in  the Lindsey paper.  There  is a presumption,  ofcourse, that information released  about the  activities  of a public  body is basically  a good thing,and I would concur with that view if the information meets two criteria.  The first is that it willbe useful and helpful to society,  and in  this case I think we are talking about the market and itsparticipants  and balancing in  a positive way the beneficial  and potentially harmful  effects  thaton our critical policymaking  processes, as  Ed Boehne  suggested,  or that policy's intended  resultis not outweighed by the benefits of an earlier  release.  In  my view,  the  notion here to release6/30-7/1/98immediately  fails on both  of those  criteria.  Let me comment  on both of them.  Before I  do, Iwould like to make  a few  points.My  first point is debatable,  but I  believe that if we  start making  regularannouncements,  we will  very soon  find ourselves  locked into doing it all the time whether  welike  it or not.  Be that as  it may, I  would like to call your attention  to the  statistics in Table  1 onto change  policy and 83  decisions not to change.  The  table also shows the tilts that existed at thetime those decisions were  made.  I am considering  symmetry to be a tilt in this analysis.  Eightyof those decisions were  accurately  foretold by the  existing tilt at the time that they were made.That is 52.6 percent  of the total.  Seventy-two  were inaccurately  foretold  by the existing tilt, or47.4 percent.  That is not a very impressive  guideline  to future decisions.  I think that is goodnews and  bad news.  The good news is that it clearly shows that the FOMC is  always looking atincoming data  with an open mind and is not being  trapped by any previous  sentiment.  The badnews is  that while immediate release would obviously reveal  what the FOMC  members  werethinking as a  group at the time  of a meeting, the  tilt is very close to being perfectly  worthless  as apredictor of what  the FOMC  will in fact do.  Fifty-fifty would be  perfectly  worthless in thisanalysis.As for the  two criteria,  the first has to do with the net impact  on society  and how itappears  to the market.  What  would be the possible objectives  of the  earlier release?  The firstmight be a better understanding  of the Federal  Reserve  on average  over time,  as Don Kohn  sayson  page 4 of his memo.  To be  sure, achieving that objective  is  highly desirable,  but I don'tthink it necessarily has  anything to do with early release of the  directive.  In fact,  as I hope toshow  momentarily,  early release  actually would  be counterproductive  to that objective.  With6/30-7/1/98respect  to the  market's functioning,  remembering  this 52.6 to  47.4 inaccuracy  split, the marketprofessionals  who  watch the Fed  closely will  immediately  know those facts.  They will  learnnothing  that they do not already  know,  and they are  going to continue to do their own analysisand act accordingly.  In the  case of the  general public,  I believe that they would very soonbecome quite disillusioned  with the  lack of follow-through  that they would perceive,  becausethey are just going to look at our  actions; they  are not going to study the reasoning and thecarefully  crafted language in  our releases.  I personally have  no doubt whatsoever that thoseunfulfilled tilts would harm the  credibility  of this Committee  to the public.  Would it  dampvolatility?  I don't think  so because in the  short term, the tilt has no  forecasting power.  Thespeculators  would respond with  a "ho  hum" and perhaps  feed the  information marginally  intotheir assessments.  Their odds  on the direction  of the next policy change  might shift  a little, butthe volatility  in the market  would continue  as  speculation continued.I  would have  a concern that immediate  releases would leave us wide open to politicaldemagoguery  by persons known  to all  of us.  Take  this 47.4 percent  of the time when  theoperative  tilt is not followed.  I can  hear it right now,  "the Fed is misleading the public,"  "the  Fedis manipulating the market,"  "the Fed is indecisive,"  "the Fed has no integrity,"  and so forth.When we announce  a tilt toward  tightening, we will  get an incessant  drumbeat until that getssettled  one way or the  other.  If we eventually do not  act, then  those who engage  in demagogicrhetoric  will  say that they  forced us to back down.  If we  do act to tighten,  we will  get the samerhetoric  we get now.  If we  announce  a tilt to ease, the  demagogic rhetoric  is going to ask us  whywe  are hesitating, why  we are dithering; the  easing clearly is desirable;  it clearly is needed;  youare already  late.  Then, if we do ease, they will  claim to  have forced us  to ease,  but  that weshould have  eased by 50 basis points, not 25,  and we  were too late anyway.6/30-7/1/98That brings me to criterion number two.  To release  information  is good unless itaffects the policymaking process  and  its results in  a  seriously perverse  manner,  and I think itwould do that in three  ways.  Two of them have already  been  mentioned.  The  first is that thisCommittee would  in my  view  lose credibility with  the general  public,  and that would weaken  ourability to conduct  an  effective  monetary policy.  Secondly,  I think the political  demagoguerywould be dangerous in the sense that it would be very hard for us  to ignore.  The  worst but notunlikely  result would be that at some point we  might feel  obliged to assert our independence  andact in a way that would be harsh  and perhaps  premature.Thirdly,  as Ed Boehne  said a minute ago,  I think that our symmetric/asymmetricconvention  has been  very useful.  It depressurizes  uncertainty.  It legitimizes  uncertainty  and itlegitimizes delay  when delay  is  appropriate.  It helps build a consensus.  I think that regularannouncements  would ultimately cause us to  lose the use of that  very useful  convention.  If theFOMC  wants to change policy, then it does  so and if it wants to decide  on  "no change  plus  atilt," then that  should be  the result.  But if we were  immediately to announce  the tilt without apolicy move,  it is very  likely in my view  that the  announcement  would move  the market at leastsome  of the time, possibly the equivalent of about one-half  a policy move or maybe more, butsometimes the market  would not react  at all.  We would never know.  As we  sat here  and voted,knowing that the tilt was  going to be released,  we would not be able to anticipate  with anydegree of certainty  what the effect would be on the  market.  That would create the  likelihood ofan unintended  and unpredictable  policy change.  I believe  that after that happened  a couple  oftimes, we  would feel burned  and we  would very  soon cease  to use the  symmetric/asymmetricconvention.  I think that would be  a very  important loss  in a couple of ways.  It  would  frequentlyforce  the Committee into timing  decisions  on  a basis that it would not otherwise  choose  and  that6/30-7/1/98might be unwise.  Secondly,  again  as Ed Boehne  said, I think it would remove  a  very useful andlegitimate consensus-building  tool.I do not think it is any accident  that there  is no other central  bank of significanceanywhere  that uses  such an immediate  release.  In my opinion,  we  should not do it either.  I thinkwe have it right at this point.  Let us not try to fix it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I am  going respectfully to  take the opposite viewfrom that supported by Ed Boehne  and Mike Kelley.  Incidentally, I would like to thank DaveLindsey for his memorandum  that I think laid out the choices  well, especially  the roadmap.  Thatwas a huge help, for me anyway.I believe any  consideration  of this question  of whether we should disclose the tiltimmediately needs  to  start by asking whether  the tilt is useful in general  in our deliberations,whether it is released  or not.  I believe  it is.  In my view,  the need to consider  the tilt languageforces  the Committee to keep in closer touch  with its consensus  and to specify it more preciselyat any point in time.  As I  see it, that facilitates  our taking timely policy actions.  It  also allowsthe  Committee collectively  and as  individual  members  to  express  a concern or an expectation  onone side or the other of neutrality without necessarily  favoring an immediate  change in thefederal  funds rate.  It does not always work that way with  me in practice,  but certainly  it can inprinciple.The fact that the  tilt language  is useful does  not necessarily  mean  that releasing itimmediately  would facilitate  the implementation of policy.  But my own view is that doing sowould be constructive,  and I would cite three main  reasons for that view.  These have  alreadybeen  alluded to.  First, we all know that markets  do not like surprises,  and in my view  they work6/30-7/1/98better when they  are not surprised.  Releasing  the  tilt immediately would keep the markets  betterinformed  and better apprised of the  direction in which  we are most likely to move over time andin  that way help better prepare  markets  for impending  changes.Second, it seems to me that the  same principle  that guided our decision  back inhere.  As  I understood  it then,  the principle was that greater transparency  was better than lesstransparency  unless there  were clearly negative consequences  of greater transparency  for ourdeliberative  process.  I respect the differing  opinion that has been expressed,  but I am notconvinced that  this procedure  would necessarily  have a negative  effect  on our deliberations.  Infact, I think we can make an  argument that it might enhance  them under some circumstances.  Ithink Mike  Kelley's point  about being  demagogued is  a good one, but on the other  side of that,immediate release would reduce the  problem  of leaks.  I think it also would reduce  ourvulnerability to the  politically  very sensitive charge  of secrecy,  or excessive  secrecy.  To me, thatis one  of the most serious charges  that can be leveled  against the central  bank in this  society.Immediate announcement  of the tilt would work to reduce  that problem.Finally, immediate  disclosure  of the tilt would enable markets  and the public  generallyto interpret  incoming data  against the background  of fuller knowledge  of the Fed's currentposition, even recognizing  that our position might  change.  For example,  stronger-than-expecteddata coming in  after disclosure of an upside tilt would be more  likely to produce  a reaction  inthat long-term  interest rates can play as  automatic  stabilizers for the economy.If the  Committee accepts that position,  as  I do, the next issue is how  we wouldimplement  it.  My own preference  would be to release the operating  paragraph  of the directive6/30-7/1/98after every meeting.  We all  know the  language  is not exactly  Shakespeare,  but it is what  we infact use  to explain  our decisions after each  meeting and to convey those decisions to the Desk.  Ifwe  are going to continue  to do that, I do not see any compelling reason for withholding  thatinformation from the public.  I also do not see any reason  to release  anything beyond theoperating paragraph--the  other language  in  the directive. I think it would make sense, Mr.Chairman, to continue to rely  on your testimonies and  speeches to convey the Committee'sbroader thinking about underlying economic  developments  that condition  our decisions.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I had a question for Don Kohn before making  a comment.  Don, youreferred to occasions when  we did not change  policy but saw  a possibility that we would do so inthe next week or so after the  meeting depending on the  incoming data.  How  did that affect  ourwording of the  directive?  Do you recall?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  No, I don't recall exactly.  I believe  the Committee adopted  a  very strongasymmetrical  tilt.  I am thinking of December  1991  when the discount rate was cut by a fullpercentage point and the  federal funds rate  was cut by 1/2  percentage  point less than a week  afterthat December meeting.  The members  left  the meeting with  a strong presumption  that theywanted to get a package  of easing actions  together that included both the discount rate and thefederal  funds rate.  I think there was  a strong  tilt or presumption  in that directive, but I don'tremember  the exact  language.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I cannot remember either.  Let me  make a few  comments.  There havebeen some interesting points made with  regard to reasons  why we might not want  to announcechanges  in the tilt.  But I believe there  are some advantages  to making an announcement  whenwe change the tilt as  well as  when we change  the funds  rate itself.  Announcing decisions6/30-7/1/98concerning  the tilt would in my view  provide  additional  information  to the markets  that wouldenable them  to  function more  efficiently.  We have  talked in the past about conditioning theon the timing  of testimony  or speeches  that are going to be  given by the Chairman.  This is asimple way to accomplish  the same  thing.I also think these  announcements  would cut down  on leaks.  We have had problemswith leaks  associated with the tilt.  Announcing  changes  in  the latter would make the decisions tochange it more  meaningful because  in  effect the tilt would become an  additional  instrument ofpolicy.  I see  that as  a good thing, not a  bad thing as  Governor Kelley implied.  There  are timeswhen  there  does not seem to be  agreement  or a  clear consensus  about  what a particular  decisionabout  the tilt actually means.  That is obvious.  It seems to me that making  a publicannouncement  would require more clarity within  the Committee  as to what it means,  and thatcould be a positive development.I  also believe  that on  occasion  the availability of an  unannounced  tilt has provided  away for us  to defer making  tough decisions about  policy actions that should be taken.  I do worrya little that a policy of regular announcements  could cause us not to use the tilt, but it doesn'thave  to turn out that  way.  One approach  that I have  been thinking about  is that theannouncement  could  actually  be the  entire directive rather than just the  operating paragraph,  butI haven't thought enough about that.  It seems to me  that the full directive,  while  it may not beShakespeare,  provides  a little more  information  that would be  of interest to the  markets.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I come  out where Mike  Kelley, Ed Boehne,  and the Chairman  do.  I didnot get there  very easily.  It does  seem to me that we have  an obligation  to be as clear as possible6/30-7/1/98and to get across to the press  and the public that follows  monetary policy developments  that weare dealing  with hard issues, that we are balancing  risks, and that no mysterious  things go onbehind the walls of the temple.  I want people to understand  what our discussions are about.  Inthat context, I have been rather admiring of what the Brits have  done in  getting it all out andtalking more clearly than it seems to me we sometimes do.  So, I started with the notion  thatto the markets,  to whom is it a signal?  Just to us?  I came  to the conclusion  that it is really asignal just to us  and that putting it out to the markets would have  all of the difficulties that MikeKelley and Ed Boehne have discussed rather eloquently.  I believe  it would  end up being moreconfusing than not, in  part because  the world changes in six weeks and we change  our minds.  Itis not a good predictor of future policy actions  largely because  we often perceive thingsdifferently by the time  of the next meeting.  I don't think we want to be  in a position of having toexplain  that as well as  everything  else.I conclude that we are doing more or less the  right thing with two exceptions.  I wouldamend the wording  of this directive.  I do not have a proposal  right now, but it is mysterious  inthe  extreme with the  "woulds"  and the "mights."  Every time I hear it, I have  a little difficultynot laughing.  [Laughter]  I think we could do better than that if we put our minds to  it.  The otherexception is that I don't see any  harm in announcing  a "no change" decision  in just that way.  A"no change"  decision is a policy decision just like  a change, and I don't see why both should notbe  treated the same way.  We could just state what we decided  at the  end of the meeting in  anordinary way rather than continuing  to use the arcane  expression that  "the  Committee met."

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, could I remind us all  why we6/30-7/1/98"no change"  in  policy, we are in some  sense lying  because  there  has been  a change  in policy.There has  been  a change  in the tilt.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  I  agree with that.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  That is why we invented the notion of saying"the meeting has ended, there  is no further  announcement."

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  Can't we say we decided not to move the federal  funds  rate?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Had we  said that the first time, I  suppose wecould continue  to say that.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  Can't we now?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  The reason  that we  want to be very clear isprecisely  not to deceive  the public.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I don't think what I am proposing  would deceive  the public.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I  think our current  practice has  the benefit thatpeople  are used to the  way we  do it now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN. I  agree  that it may be arcane,  but I think it isunambiguous.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I think it just adds to the perception  of a mysterious Federal  Reserve.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If you can figure  out a way  to get the directiverewritten,  everyone  around this table, or a majority at least,  would agree  that that would be agreat accomplishment.  We tried several times to improve the paragraph,  but without success.The current  wording is awful.  We all  agree it is awful,  but the trouble is we all agree  it is awfulin different  ways.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stem.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me  start by saying what  I am not infavor of.  I  am not in  favor of releasing  the tilt, the full directive,  or the operating paragraph  ofthe directive.  I believe there probably is more  noise than value in doing  any of the above.Having  said that, I  do think that increased disclosure  and increased  communication  have  servedus well  on balance over the years. I do not conclude that we have somehow,  or at least I'm notentirely  convinced  that we have  somehow,  stumbled into optimality here [laughter]  and are doingjust the right thing.  So, I am giving thought  to what we can do incrementally,  what I woulddescribe  as  another small  step toward providing  additional information.What I am attracted to, and I think this comes largely from the discussion  we had ameeting or two ago, would be a statement of our thinking  after every meeting.  For the most part,this statement  would be retrospective  rather than prospective,  but it would help to explain  whywe came  out where we did not only in  the cases where  we changed policy but also where we  didnot change policy.  As Don Kohn  already has suggested,  drafting something  like that  is probablynot going to be easy.  On the other hand, those  of us at the Reserve  Banks  all have someexperience with that  when we communicate  the discount rate  discussion and decision  of ourboards to the Board  of Governors.  So, I  don't view that  as an entirely impossible  task.  I dothink it would be another  small step toward improving  communication.  My judgment is that itwould be received well  in the marketplace  and elsewhere and would  help people understandwhat we are  thinking about, what we are  concerned  about,  and some of the  difficult tradeoffs  thatGovernor Rivlin  referred to.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I want to comment on that briefly.  I think it is  far easierto write  a statement  when we  are taking action  because  we have a majority of the members whofavor the  policy move,  presumably  largely for the same  reasons.  It is very difficult to agree  on astatement  when  we are not taking action.  In other words, to try to capture in  a statement  thereasons  why people are not doing something  is in my view far more difficult than  stating whycertain things were done.  I may be wrong on that, but my experience  in trying to writecommuniques  over the  years  is that there is a real, excuse  the expression,  "asymmetry"  in howone approaches  this.  That is a practical  consideration.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  You  could well be right.  I  suppose we could, if we wanted to, try it outinternally before deciding  to go public with it to see  after a meeting or two whether we  couldcraft  a statement  that people agreed with.  Presumably,  you would want to have  something in theback of your mind before  the meeting began,  so you  could proceed  from there.  That is a way ofapproaching  it and  seeing how  difficult it might be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  When  I try to think through this  issue, I start with three  elements.  Wehave policy decisions;  we have  a policy rationale that we try to convey to the markets;  and wehave  the internal policy debate.  I think it is  very important that the internal  policy debate be keptconfidential  so that we can have  a complete  and free exchange.In terms of the policy decisions,  I believe they  should be disclosed promptly to theparticipants  and to  avoid the problem  of different  market participants  with different positionsgetting information  at different  times.  In the past, before  the funds rate decision was  announced6/30-7/1/98after every meeting,  some market  participants, the  experts,  got the information  first, and I do notthink that is a wise way to operate.In terms of the  rationale, a fully articulated rationale is impossible.  We  are nevergoing to agree  on exactly why we do things.  We all  come out in  somewhat different directions.The rationale that is incorporated  in the directive is  very,  very general.  It is mostly boilerplate.  Idon't understand the  difficulty of releasing the  full directive  because it is almost all boilerplate,and it is a very minimal common  ground that we can agree  on.  So,  I would be in favor ofreleasing the directive.  I cannot imagine that release  would cause us  any grief.The issue then comes down  to the question  of whether the  tilt is a  policy decision  ornot.  If it is not a policy decision, it seems to me that it does  not belong in the  directive at allbecause the directive is a  statement of what we  are telling the Open Market Desk  to do and theunderlying  rationale for that.  I think the tilt could be  used constructively to convey our sense ofthe balance  of risks,  the likely  future direction of our policy decisions.  I believe that is the  pointthat Bob Parry was making.  Of course, that is where I came in at my very first meeting back  inproviding  some signal to the markets  about our future policy direction,  and we  thought movingto  asymmetry might be useful in that regard.  Maybe  it is like a half step on the funds rate.  Wemight have different interpretations  of exactly what it is, but I think it would be useful to keep itin the  directive  and treat it as part of our policy decision, providing a sense to the  market of ourfuture  direction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Gramlich.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I have not been struggling  with  this issue very long  as everybodyknows,  but I  am tentatively in favor of releasing  the operational  paragraph,  or something like  it,6/30-7/1/98after every meeting essentially for the reason that Bill  Poole just gave.  At the same  time, Iunderstand the  arguments that Ed Boehne, Mike  Kelley, and the Chairman  have made.  I do notthink the  system is fundamentally  broken,  so I don't care passionately  about this.  I thinkGovernor Rivlin made  two  very  good suggestions  that I would endorse.  By the way, if a group isestablished to try to draft this paragraph,  I do not want  to be on it.  [Laughter]  I'm used touniversity-professor  speak and not central-banker  speak.  My participation  would be an outragein terms of comparative  advantage,  [laughter]  but I do think it could be written better.In terms of the  suggestion that Gary  Stern made about providing  some informationafter each meeting, I thought  about that, too.  But it strikes me that what  we would be doing thenis  subjecting the Chairman to a press  conference  every  afternoon  after our meetings.  I do notwant to  do that to him.  So, I would not be  for that suggestion.Let me also raise one other issue.  An intermediate  step we  might consider takingwould be to release  the minutes slightly before  instead of slightly after the following meeting.  Iasked about this at the dinner  last night.  The Bank of England,  as you know, is considering  thatpossibility.  The Chairman  indicated that one reason  we could not do that was that there is somecontingent language in the minutes.  There have  been so many fun  things occurring  this morningthat I haven't had a  chance to read the minutes  carefully to figure  out how  much,  but I believethere is not that much.  I think the minutes could be moderately rewritten.  This is difficult to doin periods when  we are tightening.  When  we  are easing, we are heroes  and nobody  cares much.When  we are tightening, it is hard to do, but in that circumstance  I see  a lot of advantage togiving a warning  before we  do the deed.  So, if we don't go all the way to releasing  theoperational paragraph  immediately  after each  meeting, a possible intermediate  step is  to releasethe whole minutes  a little before the next meeting.6/30-7/1/98

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we already  have had some verythoughtful  discussion  of this topic.  I will try to add incrementally to that if I can.  I believe wehave an opportunity  to take  another small step toward greater transparency.  I believe such  amove would be constructive  because  the additional  information  would help participants in thefinancial  markets to better understand the  FOMC's assessment  of risks.  This would allow theFOMC to better prepare  the public  for changes  in policy that might lie ahead.Let me comment  on three  issues.  First, should we change  the announcement  policy?Second,  should we add the tilt of policy to the  announcement?  Third, should we immediatelyrelease the full directive?I believe  that announcements  should be used  on occasion even  when there  is nochange  in policy.  First, if there were  significant  uncertainty  about whether  or not policy wouldchange,  we might explain  why we chose  not to change policy.  Second, if we were expected tochange  policy and did not, again we  might explain  why.  Third, if we did not change  policy butchanged the tilt in the directive,  then we should  explain why.  On  the other hand, we should notbe in a position where  we feel compelled  to make an announcement  in  the case  where we  werenot expected to  change policy and did not.Whether  policy is symmetric or asymmetric  is a very  simple way of conveyingimportant  information  to the market  and to  the public more  generally  about how the FOMCweighs  the risks  going forward.  I believe we should announce  our assessment of those risks aftereach meeting.  Would we  make less use of an asymmetric  bias?  I think that if we  agree to behonest  and use this  procedural  change to enhance  public transparency,  we will not use it any  less.6/30-7/1/98I think the  memos we received on  this issue contained two very interesting  argumentsagainst immediately  releasing the entire  directive.  First, it was said that the opening paragraph  iswritten  before  the meeting and is basically  vacuous.  Second,  it was noted that the language ofthe directive neither says what it means nor means  what it says.  Thinking about this  even for afew  seconds  suggests an obvious  solution.  First, we might eliminate the  first paragraph  andperhaps replace  it with our announcement.  Second, we could improve  the language  so it sayswhat  we mean  and we  can honestly say we mean what  we say.  My first preference  is to publisha new  and improved directive.  My second best is to announce  our tilt decision following  eachmeeting.  In  addition, depending  on the  Committee's  decision,  I would like  to provide anexplanation  when there  is  a change  in the funds rate, a change  in the tilt, or a no-change  directiveunder the circumstances  that I detailed  above.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  After listening to a number of verygood arguments  from people who have much  longer tenures  than I do in this  area, I will weigh injust a little.  I believe  that we have two decisions to make.  The first is whether we should makeany announcements  after meetings  when there  is no change in policy.  I think the answer to thatis  "no"  because I don't think such a decision  represents  a  consensus  in the same sense as adiffering  reasons why  individual members  of the  Committee  may decide not to make  a change inpolicy.  It is very difficult, as  you point out, Mr. Chairman,  to write  a clear  summary statementabout such  a decision.  We  spend a  fair amount  of time discussing  factors relating to our policypreferences  before  coming to a consensus  on not changing  policy, but we would then  be hard6/30-7/1/98pressed to  state clearly and concisely  the reasons  for that consensus.  That exercise  would not beproductive.Secondly, with  respect to announcing  the  tilt, I actually  see that as a close call, thoughI have a  slight preference  in favor of making  an announcement.  The reason  is that I believe thetilt does  reflect a change  in policy and  a consensus  is needed to make that change.  So, I think itis useful to inform  the markets of that for a variety of reasons  that others have  alluded to.  One isthat we often want to condition  market expectations  in one way or another.  That may be donethrough  statements  or speeches that you make, Mr. Chairman,  but in  some sense releasing ourthink  we can  indeed educate  the markets on what  this means.  Mike Kelley pointed to  a table thatsome  would interpret as  indicating that we are quite undecided when  we adopt a tilt.  One  of thethings we might do if we  were to undertake  to make this  announcement  would be to educate thethe risks are in one direction  or the other.  The tilt is a way to disclose  what the Committee thinksthe risks are, and that might  be very helpful, though  we could  also then  step back from that as weget new information.  I think that indicates that we are responsible public  servants  as opposed  toirresponsible  public  servants.  I am not so concerned  about having people  belittle  us or ask  uswhy we have changed our minds because  we  always have new  information  to assess  after ourFinally, as I understand the origin  of this,  some of the language  of the tilt as I read  itsuggests that  it is aimed  at intermeeting  actions.  It seems that we have moved  away fromintermeeting  adjustments in  the target for the  funds rate,  and therefore  perhaps  the tilt has  takenon a  slightly different  meaning that can be disclosed more clearly and more readily to the public.6/30-7/1/98For those reasons,  while  it is a close call,  I would be in favor of disclosing  the tilt but not makingstatements  when we  have made no change in policy.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I have  been the beneficiary  for many yearsof the  wisdom and experience  of Ed Boehne  and Mike  Kelley, and it is with  some  uneasinessthat I come out on the other side on this issue.  I am most comfortable  with the kinds ofcomments  that Al Broaddus  and Bob Parry made  for the following  reasons.  First of all, I wouldagree  with Alice Rivlin that  at the minimum we certainly  should be able to find a way  to redefineand recast the language relating to the tilt.  We did it in the first sentence  of the operationalparagraph relating  to the federal funds  rate,  and I have to  believe that somebody can in fact  winthat Nobel  prize.  We  should try again.Second,  I  guess the unspoken  assumption is that there is no turning back  once weliberalize our disclosure policy.  We will be stuck with whatever  additional  disclosures we  go to.I just mention  that because  I  do not think  anybody  has focused  on this explicitly.I  also start  with an underlying  bias that more  transparency and more  information  arebetter than less.  I  would argue that serious  observers  in financial  markets  and elsewhere  of ourpolicymaking  are  sophisticated enough  to understand  the nuances  when  we announce  the tilt andthey also are able to interpret  changes in the economy  between  the announcements  just as wehave to.The other argument  that I would underscore  without repeating all of it is thatannouncing  the tilt would avoid the misinformation  that spread just a couple  of meetings  ago.  Ibelieve  that is going to happen  again.  It was  most unfortunate  at the time.  We all  struggle withhow to  deal  with  misinformation,  and I think that  avoiding it is worth something.  I think David6/30-7/1/98Clementi's comments last night suggest that the Bank of England's  early experience  withdelayed information has  given them the  same type of problem.  So, announcing  our decisionsdoes  in my view  avoid the risk of what I call  "slips,"  not "leaks." I would prefer to put a morecharitable  spin on that and assume  that we  simply from time to time may say  something wewished  we had not.  That cannot  happen if we  already have made the  announcement.I also agree with the comment that any small  step we can take that reduces the  sense ofsecrecy that surrounds  our activities  is in our long-term  interest as an organization.  We simplyneed to  move a little further in that direction.  I don't believe we can make these announcementson an ad hoc basis  at one meeting  and not at another.  I think it has to be a routine that we  use forevery meeting.  The cleanest  and simplest way would in  fact be to release the operationalparagraph  of the directive.  It takes  care of announcing  the tilt and it also accommodates  AlBroaddus's  proposal  to announce  our fed funds target  at every meeting, not just when  we havechanged it.  This is not a  "slam dunk" issue,  but I have a modest preference  to come  out on thatside  of it.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

MR. JORDAN.  Thank  you.  I think that if someone did an empirical  study of centralbank behavior, at least for the last couple  of decades  of fiat monies unanchored  by a goldstandard or something  else, they would conclude  that there is an asymmetric  bias toward easiermoney.  The reason,  of course, relates  to the  existence of an asymmetrical  political bias towardeasy money, which  already has  been alluded to.  Because of that, we  have  seen a search for away to neutralize that political bias,  and it takes various  forms such as a  provision in theMaastricht  treaty that gives central banks a mandate for price  stability, currency boards  thatanchor their policies to  a strong hard currency,  and other ways that try to institutionalize  an6/30-7/1/98asymmetric  bias toward  tightening or at least to neutralize  the asymmetric  bias toward ease.  Inthat sense, I would never  favor an asymmetric  bias toward ease, announced  or unannounced,because  it is redundant.  [Laughter]I also question the  value  of having  a stated bias toward tightening,  whether releasedimmediately or later, and any signaling that comes from that.  Governor Gramlich  stated that hefeels there is  some value in signaling  or communicating  in advance  what  we are  going to do.  Ilook at what the Bank of England did in May,  and I do not see the downside  of their havingtaken an  action  that caught a  lot of people by surprise.  Why  is that necessarily  a bad  thing?  Infact, I worry about the opposite.  Before we started in early  1994 to announce changes  in  thefunds  rate or to release a statement  at the end of our meetings,  the Fed watchers  had to interpretDesk actions,  and success at that created a  rent or a value to those people.  We took that awayfrom them and I was happy we  did.  But now  we may create  a similar opportunity for those whocan  interpret our statements or their tone and feel or something like  that.  I think that there  is ahazard in  that approach  over time.I saw  a cartoon a few months  ago in a magazine that a lot of you probably do not read,so I will describe the cartoon.  It showed  a man sitting in front of a television  set.  The televisionset says,  "This is just a test; if it had been a real  emergency,  Alan Greenspan  would have  saidso." [Laughter]  I have  seen and I suspect everyone has seen  newsletters  to customers  ofbrokerage  houses that claim to know the Fed is not going  to tighten policy because,  if it were,Alan Greenspan would have  signaled in advance.  In the  absence  of a  signal,  you are  safe inassuming that nothing is going to happen.  Over time, there  is  a risk in allowing that view todominate  behavior.  Ultimately, of course, it is  our actions not our words that matter.  I just amnot convinced that even having an  on-again,  off-again  asymmetric bias  is desirable.  It does tend6/30-7/1/98to reinforce  an unfortunate  conviction that contemporaneous  data have a heavy  weight in policyrather than a  long-term strategic  focus.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, I wind up agreeing  with the  veryfine explanations by President Boehne and Governor Kelley that have been supported by anumber  of people,  but let me  say why.  First of all, a bit of history:  The reason that we decidedin February  1994 to announce  changes  in the funds rate was partly transparency  and partlyethics.  The Committee's  previous policy  of making  a decision  and then having the Desk at theNew York Bank in effect  apprise the cognoscenti through  its operations in the  market seemed, inmy view  as someone  who had been in the business  22 years,  to  verge on the unethical.  Thereason is that it clearly  had the effect  of letting the insiders  know before the unwashed  knew.  So,one of the main reasons  we changed that practice in  my view was because it was the right thingto do,  the moral thing to  do.  At the time, we also decided that if there was a  change in the tilt, itwould  not be announced,  and that is how  we  got into the announcement  mode that I mentionedearlier.It  seems to  me that we can  go one of two ways  at the present  time.  We can either staywhere  we  are, which is what I think we should do,  or we can  move to announcing  as  soon aspossible  what the  policy decision has been.  I think a number of people who are of the latterpersuasion  have concluded  that we would  probably issue a cleaned-up  operational  paragraph thatis understandable  to the  average person.  I see that as  a big problem because  such  a paragraphwould inevitably  state very baldly what is in fact  a very sophisticated message.  Monetary policyis not an "on  and off" switch  nor is it a partially  on, partially  off switch, which  is the  tilt.  It is6/30-7/1/98rather  something that one is trying to do in  order to have a  better economy  at the end of the dayfor the good of the American people and  people around the  world.I think our present policy,  which is  to make  an announcement  when  there is  a changein the federal  funds rate, is very clear and very specific.  It is easily understandable.  If we needsome  additional explanation  of what we are doing,  ideally we have  the Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony or, if not, the  Chairman  can  either create  or take  advantage  of a  speech opportunity.We have  the great advantage  of having  an unusually  capable  spokesman, who is able  to provideall  those measures  of subtlety and nuances  that I believe  are a  very important  part  of the policymessage.  We simply cannot  do that in an  announcement  that we have to release  on the day ofthe  meeting.  If we did, we would have exactly the  problem that Ed Boehne described  so wellWe  would spend the whole meeting shadowboxing  about  what we  were  going say at the  end ofthe  meeting.  That would take  any  spontaneity out of the meeting, which  is alreadyunspontaneous  enough  because  of the knowledge  that the  whole transcript  is eventually  going tobe released.  So, people come into  the meeting with prepared  remarks.  It is always  hard for meto believe  that  if we have  prepared remarks,  we  will  spend a lot of time  listening to the otherpeople who have been trying to share some information  with us.I think that releasing  anything  on the  day of the meeting would make the meeting acompletely  unspontaneous  set piece,  and as  a result we would have poor monetary policy.  It iswonderful  to have  transparent monetary  policy.  If we could  have the best  possible monetarypolicy and the most transparent monetary  policy, I think that would be the  ideal.  I don't think wecan have  both.  In my view we are better off having the best possible monetary policy explainedto the American  people in a way that  in fact  works quite well, which is what we have now.  So, Iam very much in  favor of retaining  our present formula.6/30-7/1/98

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Coming into the meeting today,  my second  choice was to announcethe bias.  I thought that would be my ultimate  choice because I didn't think my first choicewould get anywhere.  My first choice  would be  to stop voting formally on the bias.  We do talkabout it; we  have  a rough idea of where each  of us stands;  and we know  what the consensusseems to be.  Accordingly,  I do not see a lot of advantage  to having a formal  vote and thenhaving the dilemma  of whether to release that vote or not.  However, I found President Boehne'sand Governor Kelley's  initial remarks very persuasive,  and in particular they convinced  me thatwe should not announce  the tilt.  They partially  convinced me that there is a benefit  to having aformal  bias, but I suspect that we could retain  the benefit of the  bias and  still not formally  voteon it.  That would eliminate  the dilemma about releasing it shortly after the  meeting.  Where  Icome down  is to make  no change but to consider the advantages  of not having  a formal vote  onthe bias.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  We started this discussion  at the March  meeting after changing thetilt in the directive  and arriving at a consensus  around  the table that the  Chairman  shouldsomehow  convey that decision to the  public.  Subsequently,  there was  a "slip"  or a "leak"  ofinformation  concerning  the Committee's  new  policy direction  that came out in the press.  I aminclined to the  view that situations  involving leaks  of information  are not dissimilar to the kindsof situations that brought us to fuller disclosure  in the first place.  So, I would buy into GaryStern's perception  that we have  not yet reached nirvana  when it comes  to our disclosure policy.I have some concern  about asking  either the Chairman  or anybody else to  go out  andconvey information about the  direction that Committee  policy is taking in the  absence  of a6/30-7/1/98reasonably  forthright statement  of the Committee's decision.  In  this regard,  I think a  "nochange"  decision  can  be as much  a policy decision  as a change in policy or a change  in thedirection  of the tilt.  So,  if we feel compelled  to prepare  the markets, I think it is more  consistentwith  the notion that the  decision is a Committee  decision to have the Committee  make  astatement  about where it is  than to rely even  on the  Chairman and especially  on the rest  of us asindividuals.  If we  go out as individuals  and present our own views,  we risk having  theminterpreted in a variety of ways.  We obviously  cannot change  how the journalistic communityviews  us and how  it tries  to drive  wedges between  us,  at least in the  press.  But I think it is easierto have  a common  front if we have  a common statement.  What worries  me is that we  seem tohave some sympathy  for preparing  the markets,  but we don't  seem to want to do  that as aCommittee.  We seem to want to  do that as  individuals,  and I think that has some risk.The risk of demagoguery  is always  there.  We  get demagogued  whether  we  makeannouncements  or not.  I think our ability to withstand demagoguery  is  what makes  us credible.It has  made  us credible  in the past and it will make  us credible  in the future,  and I do not thinkwhether  we disclose  or not disclose  will  change  things  a whole  lot in  that regard.  I think there  isan  advantage  to demystifying what the Committee  says, and I think there  may be simple  ways ofdoing that.  I know when  we talked  about clarifying  the directive I was on the opposite  side ofthis argument.  My thoughts  have changed  over time.  There  may in  fact be ways  after thisdiscussion  or maybe  other discussions  that follow  of making the  directive  clearer,  of releasingthe minutes  or the  operational  paragraph  earlier.I come  down on  the side of feeling more  comfortable  with the idea of disclosing  ourthoughts in a simple  way after every meeting.  I  feel that the advantages  of doing that outweighthe disadvantages.  But I must say that a lot of the comments  and concerns  expressed  by people6/30-7/1/98who have been on this Committee a lot longer than  I weigh  on me  heavily as well.  I don't think Iwould be comfortable  about making a decision on  this issue at this  meeting, certainly a decisionto change our disclosure  policy, even though  I would agree  with  a change  if we  went in thatdirection ultimately.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  as I looked  at this issue  and went back and read  someof its history, it seemed clear to me that the whole idea of the tilt as  it was designed  in an earlierperiod was to allow  compromise and build consensus.  It  is an internal mechanism  fortilt will not add to transparency  because the  directive language  relating to the  tilt isincomprehensible. If transparency  is our goal  and we want  to have  the context of our thinkingin  our release  of information  to the public, then  I believe  Governor Gramlich  has a very  goodpoint.  We should then focus on putting the  minutes  together because  they incorporate the fullcontext of our decision, and we  could release them  earlier.  But I think trying to come  up with  astatement  at  the end of this meeting to  be released  to the public  at 2:15 p.m. and to frame it in thecontext of the  discussion  at this meeting  is  an almost  impossible  task for anyone.  So, I wouldfocus  on getting the  minutes in  good shape as  soon as  possible if we want to release them  early,and that would be the  way to  enhance transparency.  I do not think  immediate release  of the tiltas  currently drafted, or probably could be drafted, will do anything but confuse.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I actually come  out very close to where Tom Hoenigdid but reach that  position  in a slightly different  way.  This has been  a very helpful  discussion  forme, including  the opportunity  to learn the history.  I have been  on  the Committee  slightly less6/30-7/1/98than four years, and  I now have  a much better understanding  of just how complicated  this issuereally is.  I view  it as  a theory  versus practice  issue.  In theory, we all favor more disclosure  andmore information  to help make  the  markets  operate more efficiently  and to help us accomplishour objectives.  But in practice, we have  a legacy.  It is the tilt, which is  an arcane  tool as I viewit.  I know that in some of my earlier meetings, the  tilt was  viewed as a  directive to you, Mr.Chairman,  as to the  authority you  would have to take  some policy action  between  meetings.People on the Committee  would say that they were  giving you this authority,  but they wantedyou to consult them before  you actually  used it.  I guess that was probably  part of the  laterevolution of this arcane tool.  In earlier times, I believe the Chairman  did not consult theCommittee  as to what he  would do between  meetings.  It is a tool that we are  not using for thepurpose it was originally created.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It is a business cycle problem.  I think it becomes  quiteusable when  events  are moving very fast  and in an  unanticipated  way.  For example,  there were  anumber of occasions  during the recession  when policy had to move fast and very rarely at thetime of Committee meetings.  So, the  Chairman's  role in this regard is really  a function  of therelative  stability  of the business cycle.  As it has  turned out in the current period, because  of thestability that is built into the economy,  we  effectively have  been ahead  of the curve,  andtherefore  making decisions only at meetings became very sensible.  Hence,  the directive to theChairman  became  irrelevant in  effect.  It is conceivable  that at some later time--two  years fromnow,  ten years from now--the tilt is going to come back  as something  that we will need to assurethe flexibility of the decisionmaking  process.  So, I  am almost certain  that the  change  will not bepermanent.6/30-7/1/98

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  That is, of course,  my point.  To try to explain this to the public  andto use the tilt as a method  of educating the public  seems fruitless to me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I agree.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  It will  confuse  the public more if we try to use this tool to educatethem about monetary  policy.  It is the wrong tool to use.  I certainly  favor educating the publicabout monetary  policy, but let's not try to do it with the tilt.  I would like to find other ways  to dothis.  I don't have  any easy  suggestions,  given the difficulty that people  have pointed out here.  Icertainly support Alice Rivlin's  suggestion, though, of writing the operational  paragraph in plainEnglish.  I, too,  am offended  by it every time we go through  it.  I would  support giving  her threeNobel prizes on  this, but I do not think fixing it is quite that difficult.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We actually  did improve  the directive once  before.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  This  directive is clear by comparison![Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  But I think we can do better.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let  me suggest the following.  Proposition  one is that ifwe make  a change it is irreversible.  Let's be certain  that to the extent we make a change,  we  areall comfortable  that we are  not going to say three  meetings later that it was a  mistake and weshould go back.  We will not be able to go back.  I think this has been  a very  useful discussion inall respects.  I would put it to Don Kohn  to do the following if everyone  is in agreement--[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  If I have  the consensus!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There  is a lot of sentiment  for releasing  the directive.  Itis not a majority.  Incidentally, in  a decision  like this,  it is not the Committee per se but the  19,  or6/30-7/1/98now  18,  who should make  the decision  because  we are  all involved.  I think it would be  amistake to base a  decision  strictly on the  views of those who happen to be on the Committee at aparticular time.  I think we  all should be equally  represented in this type of decision.  There issome sentiment,  a considerable  amount  of sentiment, for releasing  the directive.  There  may evenbe more if we make  the directive  coherent.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  There might be less!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There is the  crucial question about the value  in thedeliberative  process of various gradations  of agreement,  which is what the tilt has enabled  us todo.  I think we should come back to this issue after  (1) seeing whether  we  can find a  way toclarify the wording of the directive  and (2) examining  the interesting question  that some of youhave  raised about the earlier release of the minutes.  That would require removing  all thecontingency  material,  but that may not be  a  particular problem.After that, I would suggest that  instead putting a  variety of alternatives  on the table  welimit the choices.  In other words  the choices  might include  (1) maintaining the  status quo, doingnothing, or (2)  clarifying  the wording of the directive and releasing it at some point.  That wouldautomatically  get the tilt  into the public  domain  as quickly  as any announcement.  In principle,  Ithink the proposal  that Cathy Minehan  made  is where  we would be  if we could get there, namely,to have  a statement after  each meeting of what the Committee meant.  I just think that approachis not feasible.  I do not think it could be  done, and I would suggest that what  would come out ifwe succeeded  in doing it would be some  boilerplate  similar to what the G-7  comes  up with,which  is awful.  If there were  a way to do it, I think it would be  the most  useful thing we  coulddo.  The  directive is the  next vehicle, but the directive carries  with it the problem,  as stated in thevery eloquent remarks  of both Ed Boehne  and Mike  Kelley,  of interpreting the  meaning being6/30-7/1/98conveyed by the sentence  on  the tilt.  I also would  like to say that I think the  issue that BillMcDonough  raises with respect  to the art form of constructing  monetary  policy is relativelyimportant.  We are engaged in  a very difficult activity.  We can make it more  difficult forourselves if we lock in  certain issues  without a full understanding  of the  implications.I hate  to say  this, but we will have to come back to this issue again.  I do think that indoing so we will  be able  to narrow the  alternatives  quite  significantly.  This  has been  a veryproductive  go-around.  It has clarified  a number  of issues for me  as well,  and I have  been  aroundfor quite  a while.We  moved the  luncheon up  30 minutes because we thought we  would be availableearlier.  That turned  out only to  be half true.  We are  adjourned.
