MR. BERNARD.  The  acoustics  in  this  room  leave  much  to  bedesired,  so  you  are urged  to  speak as  much as  possible  directly intothe  mikes.  I have  to  say  that  I have  an  interest  in  this.  I'd  liketo  circulate  later  a transcript  that  does not  have  too  many gaps  init.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  anyone heard  that,  it  fundamentallydisproves  his proposition,  there being no microphone  sitting  in  frontof  Norm!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Make sure  none of  them  is  an  18-1/2 minute  gap!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Who would like  to move  the  approval  ofthe minutes?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  So  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Peter Fisher,  youare on.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Peter?  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I have  two,  Peter.  First,  could you  justquickly repeat  the part  about  the  Mexican  transaction?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  For value  today,  the Mexicans  are  drawing  anadditional  $2.5  billion  on  the  medium-term facility.  That  brings  to$10.5  billion  the  amount  that  has  been drawn on  the  facility theMexicans have with  the Treasury.  For  several months we  and theTreasury each  have  had outstanding  $1 billion drawings  on  ourrespective  short-term  swap  lines  with  the Mexicans.  Those  remainoutstanding;  the  drawings have  three-month maturities.  We have  rolledthem  over  once.  I would expect,  because  I have  heard nothing  to  thecontrary,  to  be asked  to  roll  them  over  again on August  1.  That wouldbe the  second  renewal.  In  our agreement with  the  Treasury,  therecould be  a third rollover  of  the  three-month  swap  in  the  fall.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Second question:  There  seems  to  be  a declinein  the  amount  of  liquidity in  the  foreign  exchange markets  broughtabout particularly by redemptions  by hedge  funds  and others.  Do  youthink  that  has  implications  for  the  efficacy of  intervention down  theroad?  If  the private  sector has  fewer poker  chips,  might we  actuallysee  intervention become more  successful?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  That's a very  important  and difficult  question.I would put  the  emphasis slightly differently than you.  I think theinterbank community has been reducing  its  risk  appetite and has beenquite nervous  not  just in  the  last period but  for  the whole  six monthsof  this year.  It's  that  reduction in  the  risk-taking appetite of  thedealer community that makes  it  particularly difficult  for  hedge  fundsto  operate  in  their  traditional  style.  Now,  the  fact  that  there might7/5-6/95be  smaller positions  in  the market--and we have  some  confirmation ofthat--can cut  either  way on  the  efficacy of  intervention.  If  peopleare  closer  to  neutral,  it's  harder  to  catch  them  far  off  guard--leaning  far  the  wrong way.  On  the  other hand,  if  positions  aresmaller  and people  are  slightly off  guard, it  may be  easier  tofrighten  them back  to  neutral.  There  is  not much  science  to  thatassertion and  a lot  of  feel.  I think there  is  something  to  yourpoint,  but  there  could be  occasions  where  it  would be  harder  tointervene  effectively because  everyone  is  sitting happily  at  neutralin  terms  of  their own  risk  appetite.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  We  only know about  the  individual  withdrawals--I guess  they  are called redemptions.  Do we  have any sense  at  all  ofhow big  the market  is  and how much it  has  shrunk?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We have  a survey on turnover  in  the  foreignexchange market, based on  April  data.  We  still  don't  have  all  thedata, but  it  will  give  us  a three-year  to  three-year  snapshot.  Thebetter comparison is  to  talk to  the  major  interbank firms  to  get  asense  of  foreign  exchange market  liquidity and what  is  happening  totheir volume.  In  the  last month  it  has  certainly been  thin.  There  issome variance  among firms;  different banks  have had good months andbad months  this year,  and I don't  feel  confident  that we  can  saysomething  definitive about  turnover in  the  foreign  exchange marketsthis  six months  as  contrasted with  the  first  six months  of  1994.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Peter,  I want  to  follow up  on what  you  saidabout  Mexico,  because  something went by me  awfully  fast  there.  Yousaid  the  Treasury has monetized  SDRs  to  fund  the  Mexican drawing.  Canyou  explain that  a  little?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  One  of  the  resources  of  the  ESF  is  SDRs.  Theprocess  of  monetizing  them  and presenting them  to  us--let  me  say  if  Iam  explaining something wrong, Sandy, please bail  me  out--we  take  themin  and  they get  dollars  for  them.  And  that  is  the  major--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They sell  us  SDR certificates.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  They sell  us  the  SDR  certificates;  they  get  thedollars  and we  have  the  SDR  certificates.  That  then  is  an injectionof  liquidity  that we  have  to  worry about  and  sterilize as  we would  anyother  form of  intervention  in  that  sense.  So,  that's  the  process  ofproviding  them dollars:  monetizing the SDRs.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  But we,  the  twelve Federal  Reserve Banks,  ownour respective  shares  of  these  SDR certificates  based on the  capitalof  our banks?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. How are  we  informed that we  own  them?  How ismy bank informed  that we now have  that  in  our portfolio?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It's  published on  the weekly  H.4.1  statement;  Idon't know whether  there  is  a separate  internal  notification.  There7/5-6/95already are  $8 billion  of  special  drawing  rights  outstanding  inaddition  to  the  $11  billion  of  gold  stock.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  President Jordan  is  askingwhether  somebody is  going  to  call him up  and  say  "You have  just becomethe  proud possessor of  an  increased amount  of  SDR  certificates."  Heis  asking:  "What's on my bank's  liability side?"

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Initially, it  would--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Unless  the  New York  Bank is  holding themall  and  the  increase  is  offset by  deposits  at  the  Fed wholly in NewYork--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The Treasury balance  goes  up.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  mathmatical  way is  that  the  Treasury balancegoes  up, as  we are all  saying.  That's  the  narrow answer.  But  theChairman  is  asking--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  And then we  sell  government  securities,  as  theydraw down  the balance.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's not  the  question I am asking.  Ifthe  liquification were wholly  an issue  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  ofNew York  taking onto  its  books  an  SDR certificate  and  crediting theTreasury account  for  the  $2 billion,  then  the  transaction  is  completeand  the  Cleveland Bank goes  its  merry way and nothing  happens.  Ithink the  question  is:  Are any of  those  certificates  going to  show upthroughout  the  System and what  are  the  transactions on the  liabilityside  and against whom--the New York  Bank,  the Treasury, or  what?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The current  SDRs  are distributed throughout  theSystem the way every other  asset  is.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I may be missing  the point, but  in  terms  of  theSystem Open Market--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  the point  is  that  theliquification--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  What's on  the  liability  side?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  Treasury takes  its  SDR  certificate,gives  it  to  the Federal  Reserve, which  simultaneously places  the  SDRcertificate  on  the  asset  side  of  our consolidated balance  sheet  andincreases  the  Treasury deposit  on  the liability side.  That's  whathappens to  the  consolidated  system.  President  Jordan  is  asking whathappens  among  Federal Reserve  institutions?  If  you are going toallocate  SDR certificates to  the  various  Banks,  then what  appears onthe  liability side?  Are we  creating a deposit  for  the Treasury on alltwelve Banks?  Is  it  a transfer  from the  Federal  Reserve Bank  of  NewYork?  What actually is  done?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It's  done  through  the  inter-District  settlementaccount.7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It  could be  the  inter-District  settlement  account;Cathy  says  it  is.  But  the  other point,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  that  thatdeposit  never  shows  up.  The  Treasury knows  in  advance  that  it  isgoing  to  get  $2 billion.  It  doesn't  call  $2 billion of  funds  in  fromthe  commercial banks.  So,  the  Treasury deposit  is  $5 billion  or  $7billion  or  whatever it  is  the  Treasury is  targeting  that day.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  has nothing  to  do  with  commercialbanks.  This  is  basically a Federal  Reserve  crediting  of  the  Treasuryaccount  for  the  amount  of  the  SDR  certificates.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right.  Then  the  Treasury doesn't  call  in  thefunds.  The Treasury's  account--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  the  Treasury then  disburses  thosefunds  to Mexico.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  On  the  same  day.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Wouldn't we  just have  a change  ofassets  on  the balance  sheet?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  In other  words  the  check  is  thendrawn on  the Treasury account,  if  you want  to put  it  that way, andwill  end up  in  the  Fed account  for  foreign  central banks,  or  whateverwe  do with it.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Maybe.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  But  on  the Cleveland bank's  accounttheir  share  of  SDRs  goes  up and another asset  goes  down,  right?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  That  other asset  is  Treasury securities  tHat  Petersells  to  offset  the  increase  in  SDRs.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  That's  what  happens  to  Cleveland'sbalance  sheet.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  And it  happens  the  same day.  The Treasury'sbalance at  the Federal  Reserve never  changes,  whether the  SDRs  areissued or not.  They  target that  at  a given number;  they know  inadvance  what  it  is.  They don't  raise cash;  they  don't sell  bills.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So  ceteris paribus,  the  total  onCleveland's balance  sheet  stays  the same?  SDRs go up  and Treasurysecurities go down.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  You sterilize  immediately so  that our  share  ofthe  Treasury portfolio goes  down by the  same  amount  at  the  samemoment?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  If  I could just  add one  other factor--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'm  still not  sure  I understand  thistransaction.7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  We  will  endeavor  to  have  a simplified--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  still  haven't discussed how  the  moneygets  to  Mexico, where  it  is,  and who  draws  the  check.  It's  aninteresting  issue  that  I will  reraise  outside  of  this meeting, unlesssomebody needs  to  know.  Maybe  you already understand all  this.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  One more  fact  is  that  this  is  a case  in whichthe  Federal Reserve  has  no  choice  as  to  whether  it  accepts  SDRs.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I understand that.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  In  a lot  of  other transactions  with  theTreasury, the  Federal  Reserve has  some  choice.  But  the  law says,  Ithink,  that  the  Secretary of  the Treasury may issue  SDR  certificatesand  the Federal  Reserve shall  accept  them.  Period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do we  shift  U.S.  Treasury securites  fromour account  to  Mexico?  Never mind!

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We will  endeavor  to  clarify it  for  allinterested parties.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Actually, I had a related question.  I wascurious  about  the  same  thing Jerry raised.  Do  we  end up with anearning asset?  Is  there  a way  to  earn  anything on  the  SDRs  that  wehold or  is  that,  in  effect,  a nonearning asset?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  It's  nonearning.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  We  reduce  our  earnings.  When you're  clarifyingthis,  another question  is:  This  is  a repurchase  agreement,  right?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  No.  It's  outright.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  It's  an  outright purchase.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Like  gold certificates,  it's an outrightpurchase;  there  are no repurchase  agreements  on the  gold certificates.They are  required to  redeem  them under  some  circumstances.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  This  differs  from my understanding, then,because  in  February or March or whenever, my understanding when  wewere going  to  take yen or  deutschemarks--

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  That would be warehousing.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That's  warehousing.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  You are  saying  this  is  not  warehousing,  this  isnot  a repurchase agreement?  So,  this  is  permanent.

[SECTION]

MR. MCDONOUGH.  Correct.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Permanent,  yes.7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

MR. MCDONOUGH.  It's  an  acquisition  of  an  asset,  not  a swap.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I didn't  know  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions  for  Peter?President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  This  is  on  another  subject.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I want  to  thank you!

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Peter,  I was  on  the  "morning call"  this  morningand  one of  the  subjects was  the  fed funds  futures  rate.  Myrecollection  from  this morning was  that  the  fed  funds  futures  rate  isnow indicating  a 60  or  65  percent probability of  a 25  basis point cutin  the  fed  funds rate  this  month.  I was just  wondering how  that  tiesin with what  you were  saying here  this morning.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think we  heard the  same  thing  from  the  samesources at  different  times  this  morning.  Looking  through  the  pricingof  the  contract and the different  time horizons  one  has  to  adjust  for,there  is  a  60ish percent probability,  if  you read it  literally, of  amove early  in  the month--meaning now.  And  there  is  an impliedprobability closer  to  100  percent  of  a 25  basis point  easing by theend  of  the month.  Without  going  too  far  into  the  gymnastics of  it,that's how one  interprets  14  basis points  on a contract  that  settlesnear  the  end  of  the  month, given the  different probabilities  anddifferent  time  horizons.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  But I thought  I heard you saying  that  themajority of  the  opinion  in  the  market  was  that  there would not be  amove.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.  I was  trying  to  offer a note  of  cautionabout  whether you should read  that  price  literally as  saying thateveryone  in the  market has  agreed that  those  are  the probabilitiesattached to  a move  or whether  it's  a clearing price  between  some whohave  a much higher sense  of  confidence  that  there  will be  a moveearlier  in  the month and others who don't  think there  will  be a movethis  month at  all.  There  is  room for  all  sorts  of  interpretations  asto whether  a given basis point  implication  in  the  fed  funds contractindicates  a consensus view  or a range  of  different views  that  find  aclearing price.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  I've got  it!  [Laughter]  Youare telling me  that  the  SDR certificate  comes  out  of  the  Treasury  andwe  cancel  the Treasury obligation  and it  is  wholly an asset  swap  sothat  the  debt  to  the public of  the  U.S.  Treasury goes  down by thatamount.  Is  that what happens? problem  too!  [Laughter]That  solves  President Jordan's

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Can I follow up  on that?  The  same  thinghappened when we  changed the  price of  an ounce of  gold  from  $35  to  $38and then  to  $42.22.  The  Treasury got  a windfall  of  about  $1 billionto  $1.2  billion  in both  of  those  so-called devaluations.  So  an  issueon this  is:  What was  the  dollar price of  SDRs  that  we monetized?  Yousay  I have  an asset  on my balance  sheet  and  I don't know what  thevalue  of  it  is.7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's  about  $42.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It's  $42.22;  it's  equivalent  to  the  officialprice  of  gold.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  We  do  this  at  the  official  U.S.  Treasury priceof  gold?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do you  mean that  we  can  lower  the  debtto  the public  by moving  the price  of  gold up  to  the market price?That  could  cut  the  debt  back by a not  insignificant  amount!

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. I have been  trying not  to  mention  that publiclyfor  fear  that  someone might  want  to  do  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's  probably too  late;  we  justmentioned it.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  It  will  become  known five  years  from now!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Five  years  from now, it  will  be read in  thetranscript  for  this meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  By which  time  it  already will  have  been done.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions  for  Peter?  Ifnot,  would somebody like  to  move  to  ratify the  foreign currencytransactions  during  the  intermeeting period?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  I so  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Similarly, wouldsomebody  like  to  move  to  ratify the  domestic  open market operations?

[SECTION]

MR. MCDONOUGH.  So  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Then let's  move  on  to  the  Chart  Showwith Messrs.  Prell,  Simpson, Slifman, and Ms.  Johnson.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. SLIFMAN.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you  very much.  That was  a veryinteresting  around-the-world evaluation.  Questions  for  ourcolleagues?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Tom, could you briefly  describe how that  modelthat you mention on  the bottom of  Chart  8 is  set  up?  I'm not  sure  Ifollowed  it.

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON.  This  is  an  exercise using the  quarterlymacroeconometric model.  What  is  assumed here  is  that  you are willingto  lock  in  inflation basically at  current  or  recent  levels  and  to  hold7/5-6/95output  at potential.  Then,  in  the  case  of  the  so-called baselinehere, we are  taking the  CBO's  current  raw estimate of  the  fiscaldeficit.  So  basically, the  things  I just mentioned  are exogenous  tothe  model:  the  fiscal  deficit  as  well  as  the  inflation rate  and  theoutput  levels  you are  assumed to  accept.  Then we  solve  for  thefederal  funds  rate.  Basically, it's  the  long bond rate  that  isdriving  spending and  it's  the  funds  rate  or  the bill  rate  and othershort-term  rates  that  have  the  biggest  influence  on the  bond rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I want  to  follow up  on  that same  chart,  Tom.If  I'm reading  this  right,  it  says  that  if  the  bond market,  lookingforward,  feels  that  lower  future  debt  is  going  to  lead to  lower  futurereal  interest rates,  the  fed funds  rate  stays  fixed for  four  or  fiveyears.  Is  that what  it  says  literally?

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON.  Yes,  right.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That means  that rates  on  instruments  withmaturities up  to  four or  five years  ought  not  to  fall.  Isn't  thatright?

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  But  this doesn't  look a lot  like what  hashappened recently.

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  No.  I might  also point  out  that  in  thisexercise  the  simulation  starts  in  the  second quarter.  It  doesn'tstart  in  the  third  quarter, so  it  doesn't  acknowledge  the large

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON.  But  you're  right.  In  the  model,  the  longer-term  rates  that  relate  to  housing  and capital  spending  are  driving theeconomy.  The  decline  in  the  shorter maturities  would not  have thatmuch effect  on  spending in  the  model.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Does  it  follow that  expected future deficitreductions  should not move rates  on  intermediate maturities--say, two-year,  three-year,  four-year maturities?  What  you just  said is  that  ifthe  ten-year rate  stays  fixed, those  maturities won't have much effecton spending,  right?

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  That's  in  the  eyes  of  the  model.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes,  absolutely, that's  right.  The  otherquestion I had was  for  Karen.  In  all  of  the  G-7  economies--or ratherthe  G-6,  leaving out  the United States--the  forecast  is  for  growth inthe  near  term to  accelerate by various amounts  over what  it  recentlyhas been.  Presumably, in  all  the  cases  except  Japan--and, heavenknows,  maybe  even in  Japan--there will  be  fiscal  consolidation overthe  next  two  years.  You mentioned it  in  some  cases.  What  does  thisimply about monetary policy  and interest rates  in  those  countries?7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  We  actually have  explicit  interest  rate pathsbuilt  into what  we have  to  say  about  these countries.  I guess  I wouldinvert  the  question just  a bit.  I will  deal  with  Europe  first  andreturn  to  Canada.  These  are  countries  that,  as  we perceive  it,  wereexhibiting considerable  momentum around  the  end  of  last  year and eveninto early  this  year.  So,  the  questions  I ask myself  are:  What  hasslowed  these economies  in  the  first  half  of  1995  and will  thatpersist?  Will policy  action be needed  to  stimulate  those  economies?In  some  cases  that  may be,  but  I think  the  answer  that  we  get  for  someof  these  countries  is  "no."  For  example,  in  Germany the  impact  of  thetax  surcharge, which for reasons  that  I can't  fully  explain did notseem  to  have been anticipated, was  not visible  in  the  earlier data.But  when  the  tax surcharge  went  into effect  in  early 1995,  one  doessee  it  in  the  data;  we  expect  to  see  that  reversed in  early  1996 whenother  taxes  are reduced.  Some  effect  of  the  exchange rateappreciation  is  certainly a piece  of  the  story  in Germany  and maybeeven in  France,  but  there  are flip  sides  of  that  in  Italy  and in  theUnited Kingdom.  We  got GDP for  Italy this  morning, for  example, andit  was very  strong  in  the  first quarter.  So,  I guess  what  I am  leftwith by way of describing our  forecast  is  to  say  that  a piece  of  thispolicy  story is  that  the  tightening  that we  thought would come  on  lineearly  in  1995  has been postponed.  And that,  in  a sense,  is  monetaryeasing relative  to  the  baseline  from which we  were starting.  And atleast  several  of  the  factors  that we  see  as  explaining the  slowdown inthe  first  half  of  1995  we view as  having  transitory characteristics.They are  either already built  in,  as  in  the  case  of  the  German  taxes,or are not  seen  as persistent  enough  to  require  a real  policyresponse.Canada is  quite different.  The drop  in  Canada was  farstronger than  I think I can rationalize  in  these  terms.  It  wasrelated  in part  to  the  U.S.  economy, but  it  certainly was  of  anamplitude  far  greater than we  experienced in  the  United States.  Isuspect  that  there  will  be a need for  more monetary policy easing inCanada  for  recovery really  to  take hold again.  We  have  seen  actionsby the  Bank  of  Canada already,  so  I think  some of  that monetary easingwill  in  fact  be  forthcoming.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mike,  I have  a question, not  specifically aboutsomething that  came  up  in  the  Chart  Show but  about  a paragraph  thatjumped out  at  me  in  the  Bluebook, and I thought you might want  tocomment  on  it.  There  is  a reference  to  a change  in  the NAIRU;  it  isnow 5.9  percent  in  terms  of your  analysis.  My recollection  is  thatthe  very thick  study  that was  done  several years ago  came up  with anumber of  6.1  percent.  Would you explain what  elements have  changedto  produce  this?  Obviously,  longer  term,  it  does have  policysignificance.  Secondly,  there  is  a footnote  indicating  that  there  areno  adjustments  for demographics.  I think Kansas  City found  out howinteresting  it  is  to  talk publicly about  such demographics  estimates!They clearly are  relevant in  terms  of  estimating  what  the  NAIRU  islikely to  be  in  the  future.  Are we going  to  get  another  thick  studyabout  this  or  a little more detail  about  how this  change was made?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I guess  it  would be a  fair request  at  some  pointfor  us  to do  another thick  study.7/5-6/95-10-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  A thin  one would be  even  better!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  One of  the problems  of  comparing past  studieswith where we  are now  is  the  change  in  the  current population survey.Even at  this  point we  have  some  degree of  uncertainty about  how totranslate  today's unemployment  rate  into pre-1994  terms.  So,  that  canbe  one  ingredient  in  a comparison  of  old NAIRUs  to  new NAIRUs.  As  wehave  gone  along,  we have had to  adjust  our  sights  on what  this  is  andnow we  also  are  trying to  incorporate  the  experience  over  the  pastyear and  a half  with respect  to wages  and prices and trying  to  surmisewhether we might have  been  too high  or too  low.  We have  inched down abit  our working assumption  about  where the  NAIRU  is--the number aroundwhich our price  forecast,  in  effect, pivots.  At  this  point  we aretalking  5.9  percent;  it  is  a  little  lower than  it  was  previously.  Theallusion to  demographic  adjustments  in  the Bluebook was  merely  torecognize  that,  as we  look  out  over  the  next  five years,  there  will becompositional  changes  in  the  labor  force  and  there  could be movementsin  the NAIRU as  a consequence.  For  this  kind of  schematicpresentation, though, we  thought  such adjustments  would greatlycomplicate matters  and get  us  into areas  of  increasing uncertainty totry to  maneuver  them over  the  five-year  span  that  we were portraying.But  we wanted  to  alert you  that  there  were a number of  subtleties  thatwe  didn't  address  in  this  and  that  you  shouldn't be  thinkingnecessarily that  the  5.9  percent  unemployment rate  would be  thepivotal  rate  for  each  of  the  next  five years.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I have  a couple  of  questions.  I'm not  surewhether  the  first one  is  for Mike  or  for  Tom.  Going back  to  Chart  8on  real  interest  rates  and  fiscal  scenarios  and so  on and  comparingthat  with a statement  in  the  Greenbook, I'd  like  a little  furtherelaboration.  You make  references  to  what  you call  fiscal  restraint.I understand what  that  is  supposed to  mean.  But as  you describe  it  inthe  Greenbook, fiscal  restraint  has  the  effect  of  lowering  equilibriumreal  rate  . Normally, most  people would  think  that  lower  interestrates,  real  or nominal,  mean  easier monetary policy.  So,  a tighterfiscal policy causes  an easier monetary policy.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Let me  interrupt  you there.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We wanted to  make  that as  clear  as  we  could--andI guess w  failed--or maybe we  did do  it  as  clearly as  we could butthat wasn't clear  enough!  We  didn't mean that  adjustment  in  thenominal  rate, which we  took to  be a reflection of  a change  in  thenatural  r  :e,  to  be viewed as monetary  stimulus.  In  effect,  it  keepsthings  neutral  as  the  fiscal  restraint  tends  to  lower  the  naturalrate--the  rate  that would prevail  when the  economy was  in  a steadystate,  operating at  potential.  I apologize  if  we  confused you on thatscore.  In  fact,  what  we were  doing was  recognizing something  that  Ithink you raised at  the  last  meeting  about  how high the  real  short-term  rate  should be expected  to  be  over  the  longer run and whether  wefelt  that  3 percent,  or wherever  the  real  rate  is,  was  the sustainablerate.  I noted then  that  if  we  looked out  several years  that would7/5-6/95-11-become  a relevant  consideration.  I said  that  we  felt  it  was  higherthan  the  longer-run equilibrium  or natural  rate  and  that  in priorBluebook simulations we  had introduced a downward  tilt.  Since we weregoing  out  a bit  further with  the  Bluebook simulations  and we  werebuilding  in  a somewhat  more substantial  fiscal  consolidation, we  feltthat  it  would be  appropriate  for us  to  introduce  that  into  thisforecast.  So,  that's how  that  should  be  interpreted.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay,  and  I have  absolutely no problems  withthat.  I do  still have a  little problem with  the  references  to  bondenough, we  don't  have to  lower  the  funds  rate,  and that  gives me  alittle problem.  But  let me hold  that  for a second.  The Greenbooksays:  "We have  introduced a downward  tilt  in  the  funds  rate.  Thisimpetus  to  aggregate demand,"  meaning  that  this downward movementwould equilibrate.  I can  read that  statement  to  say also  that  becausethe natural  Wicksellian rate  or  some  equilibrium real  rate  has moveddown,  failure  to  move down  the nominal  rate  would be a de  facto morerestrictive policy  stance.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Assuming  inflation expectations  remain  constant.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  So,  whatever causes  the  equilibrium rate  to movedown--fiscal policy, or  God, or  something--you would say, even thoughthe  headlines  may say a lower  nominal  rate  is  an  easing,  that  failureto  lower  the  nominal  rate  is  in  fact  more restrictive.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I should emphasize  that,  given  our limitedability to  predict  these  relationships,  the  calibration  of  this  isclearly very uncertain.  I think  the point  of  Tom's  presentation here,which is  a schematic  one  in  a sense,  is  simply  that  if  there are  largeanticipatory  reactions  in  the  bond market,  then you  do  not need  tomove  the short  rate  as  aggressively in  order  to  give  a greaterstimulus  to  private  investment  spending.  It's  a simple  point,  and wedon't  want  to  suggest by the  precision of  these  charts  that we  cancalibrate  that very neatly.  Again, it's  a broad conceptual  issue andone  that,  obviously,  I would  think you  folks would want  to  contemplatein  thinking about where  funds  rates might  be over  time.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I want to  draw out  this  conceptual  aspect.  I dohave  a problem with  this  last point  about  the  rally of  the bondreserves and what  that might  do  in  terms  of  quantities.  And  that'sbecause  I have  a different  framework.  Let me  hold that  one,  though,because  I don't  want  to  take too  much time  and I want  to  ask Karen tohelp me  through thinking about  something about  Japan.  You used theword  "deflation" and  I know a number of  Japanese  commentators havedenied vigorously that  they have deflation.  I don't know what  theymean by  that,  but  the  word deflation  in  the  abstract means  that thepurchasing power of  the  yen is  rising.  I'm not  sure whether that  isreally what people have  in mind when  they  say those  things.7/5-6/95-12-If  you go  back  to  the  beginning of  this  decade,  commercialreal  estate  prices were  such that  the  Japanese would say  such  thingsas  that  the  land under  the  Imperial  Palace  was  worth more  than  theState  of  California.  We  would say  "Yes  and try  to  get  it."  All  thestocks  listed on  the Nikkei,  if  aggregated, would have  exceeded thepresent  value  of  GDP  for  the world.  We  thought  it  probably wasn'ttrue.  Or at  that  time a cantaloupe  cost  70  U.S.  dollars.  If  youthink during  the  course  of  the  decade  that  you  are going  to  remove  theimpediments  to  the workings  of  the market  so  that  the  law  of  one  pricestarts  to  operate  in  tradeable goods  and asset  prices  and things  likethat,  then  one  of  two  things  has  to  happen.  The  price of  thesethings,  converted into  the  equivalent  of  some  other  currency, has  tofall  either by a depreciation of  the  yen or by declines  in  absoluteyen prices.  Whether  it  is  proper  to  think  about  that  as  deflation ornot,  I don't  know.  What  else  could happen?  If  the yen is  not goingto  fall  in value on  the  exchange market,  then our  economics would  tellus  that  asset prices  and goods prices had to  move  toward world levels.How else  could this  adjustment  possibly be made?

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  I did not mean  to  suggest  any pejorative notionby using the  word  "deflation."  I meant  it  literally as  just  that  therate  of  change  of  certain prices was  negative.  Now, it  is  certainlytrue that  it  is  happening in  the  goods  sector because  to  some  degreewhat you described has  happened.  That  is,  we have  opened up--a  littleJapanese national  income  account  data  in  real  terms,  the  share  ofimports  to  GDP has  risen  sharply.  In  that  sense,  imported goods  andthe  competitive pressures  that  they can  apply through  market phenomenaare  having an effect  of  the  sort you might  want.  I'm not  so  sure  thatI see  that  as  much  of  an explanation  for why  land prices have beenfalling and  are  still  falling.  Nor do  I see  it  really as  anexplanation  for  the  stock market behavior.  So,  the  asset  price  story,which had its  own  special  factors  on the  up  side  in  the  late  1980s--aspeculative bubble kind  of  story,  fueled perhaps  by what  in  retrospectseems  like  a too  easy monetary policy--has  a different  story on  thedown  side as  well.  I am not particularly alarmed  that  Japanese  goodsprices  are  responding  to  competitive  pressures  from  the  outside world.I would think  that  it  might be  easier  on  all  concerned  if  it  happenedthrough an  end to  the  upward pressures  on  the yen rather than  throughfalling prices  of Japanese  goods.  But  I am not  aware  of  any rigiditystories,  for  example,  that  suggest  that because  prices have somedownward rigidity all  sorts  of  problems are being created.  I ammerely suggesting that  in  that  environment  Japanese monetary policylooks  to  be  a bit  tight,  given what  we  know about  capacityutilization, the  behavior of  wages,  and what  is  happening  to  assetprices.  All  the pieces fit  together  to  suggest  that  the stance  ofmonetary policy  could be eased  a bit  in  an  effort  to get  that economygrowing again.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I didn't  think you were  being pejorative but  Iwondered about  that policy conclusion.  I don't  see  how what youcalled fiscal  stimulus, which  I assume  is  more  resources  flowingthrough  the government  or  less  taxes,  or monetary stimulus  isnecessarily called  for.  If  what  is  happening  is  a breakdown of  thevarious  types  of  impediments  to  the working  of  the marketplace inJapan, one  should think of  that as  a wealth gain  for  the  Japanesepeople.  And  other things  the  same,  something  that produces7/5-6/95-13-miraculously a wealth  gain would not  lead  to  the  conclusion  that youneed an  easier monetary policy.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  True,  but  I am taking  into  account  the  otherthings  we  know about what  is  going  on  in  Japan.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Mike,  I have  a question  that  relates  to  currentactivity.  I have  been struck by  the  fact  that  nonwithheld income  taxpayments  this  April were  about  $20  billion higher  than  in  each  of  thetwo previous  Aprils.  I wondered what your  assessment was  as  to  theimpact  of  that on personal  consumption expenditures  this  spring.  Isthat  a significant  factor  in your mind acting as  a depressant?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It  was  one  of  the  laundry  list  of  factors  that wementioned  in  our  discussion of  consumption  in  the  Greenbook.  It  worksin  the  right  direction.  We  certainly are not  going  to  argue againstthat as  a possible drag on  consumer expenditures.While we  are on  the  subject  of  consumer expenditures--and  Iinterrupt  your discussion at  that  point--but assuming you wereinterested  in motor vehicle  sales,  Ford has released its  data  earlierthan we anticipated,  so  we  now have  Ford and GM, the Japanesetransplants,  and a number of  other manufacturers--that  is,  everyonebut Chrysler.  The  ones  we have  are  essentially unchanged  from May.Chrysler has been  indicating  that  they are  fairly optimistic.  Theyactually have  seen  their numbers,  so  I assume  that  their numbers  willlook  fairly decent,  and  this  would suggest  that  total  light  vehiclesales  in June  will  be  unchanged  to  slightly higher,  which would beright  in  line with  our  forecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  other questions  for anybody?  Wouldsomebody like  to  start our  roundtable?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I can,  if  you  don't  have anothervolunteer.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Go  ahead.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Theeconomy  of  the  Second District  remains weak, but  earnings  in  the  keyfinancial sector  appear to  be  on  the  rebound.  That bodes well  for  thefinancial  industry  itself,  for  the  service  sectors which  support  it,and for needed tax revenues  in New York City and the  states  of  NewYork  and New Jersey.  Sales  of  existing homes  are  down from  1994  butare  less weak recently  than  in  the  first quarter;  they  are now downabout  5 percent  as  compared with  10  percent  in  earlier months.  In  themost  recent month, permits  fell  10  percent  in New York  and 14  percentin New Jersey, year  over year.  Payroll  employment  in May fell  1.2percent  in New York,  reflecting cutbacks  in  local governments,  andpayroll  employment was  flat  in New Jersey.  Retail  sales  in May are up2 to  11  percent over  last  year depending on  the region, and they  seemto be  snapping back from disappointing sales  in  early spring.On the  national  level, we  see  the  economy working through  thepresent weakness  and growing stronger  in  the  second half,  entering7/5-6/95-14-1996  at  about  a 2-1/2  percent  annual  growth rate  and achieving a  2-3/4percent growth rate  in  1996,  Q4  to  Q4.  We  see  CPI  inflation  somewhatmore  pessimistically  than  the  Greenbook at  3-1/4  percent  in  1995  andinching up  to  about  3-1/2  percent  in  1996.  You will  recall  thattraditionally we  are rather bearish  in  our  view of  price  trends.  Notsurprisingly  given  the  foregoing, we  see  the unemployment  ratereaching  6 percent  this  year and dropping back  to  about  5-3/4  percenttoward  the  end of  1996.Looking only at  the domestic  economy, I believe  that  therisks  to  our  forecast  and the  risks  to  the  Greenbook forecast  arerather well  balanced.  However,  I am very  concerned about  the  possibledangers  from what may be  at  least  somewhat greater than projectedeconomic  weakness  abroad to  considerably worse  than  that.  I do notsay that  the international  part  of  the  Greenbook is  lacking  in  itsusual  realism, but  rather  that  the  risks  are mainly negative.In  the  last  several months  I, like  many of  you, have had anunusual  number of  Japanese visitors  includingThey would be  lessoptimistic  than  Karen Johnson on  the  growth  of  the  Japanese  economy inthe  next year  and a half.  Manufacturers must  invest  in  capacityoutside Japan to  be competitive  in world goods  markets,  leaving realand  disguised unemployment  behind  in a country  that is  not  accustomedto  handling that problem.  We believe  the  Japanese price  data aredistorted on  the  up  side,  and  therefore  there may be price  deflationin  the  neighborhood  of  2 to  4 percent.  With  few exceptionsinstitutions  in  the  financial  services  sector--banks,  securitiesfirms,  and  especially life  insurance  companies--have been  severelyweakened by operating losses  and bad debts.  Land prices  fell  20percent  in  1994,  and  I agree  with Karen  that  the  land prices arelikely to  drop  another  10  percent  or  so  this  year, at  least  that  ishow I interpreted the  graph.  The paper profits  of  many  firms  arelargely gone  at  a Nikkei  level  of  14,000,  which we  are relativelynear, and  at  12,000  they disappear altogether.  The Bank of  Japanfinds  itself  in  the  trap of  low nominal  and high  real  interest  rates.Monetary policy  is  tight, series  of  fiscal  packages has been  inadequate  to  provide neededstimulus.  In  the  confused political  situation,  career bureaucratshave  both more power and more  fear  of  using it.  A downward spiral  ofthe  real  economy and the  associated declines  in  financial--especiallyequity--markets  are possible and could have  a serious negative  effecton world markets  both directly and  through  generalized  investorconcerns.AIn Europe a not very  robust  recovery suffers  from  twopossible  threats  to  European unity, which  is  the  underpinning ofrecovery  in many European countries.  Those two  threats,  it  seems  tome,  are  the  growing  awareness  of  the  difficulties  of monetary unionand  the possibility that  an even worse conflict  in  former Yugloslaviacould  separate the major European powers based on traditional  andconflicting  friendships  with the  various protagonists.7/5-6/95-15-The  jury clearly  is  still  out  and the  verdict  uncertain  onthe  three major economies of  Latin America--Mexico,  Argentina, andBrazil.  Positive verdicts  are  largely  reflected  in  financial  markets.I was  in  Brazil  at  the  end  of  last week  and met  with  the  President,his  economic  team,  and  leaders of  the private  financial  sector.Ongoing  success  of  Brazil's Real  Plan  depends  on  superb  financialmanagement and near magic  in working  constitutional  reforms  in  thefiscal  area  through  a divided Congress.  Among other  things,  themembers  of  Congress  from  the  various  states  have  to  agree  to  reducethe  automatic  division  of  tax  revenues  to  those  states,  an  act ofconsiderable political  courage.  Any problem in  Brazil  would almostcertainly mean  further backsliding on their  trade  opening--particularly  their Mercosur arrangements with  their  two  smallneighbors  and,  of  special  interest  to us,  with Argentina.  Andabsolutely key to  Argentina's  ongoing  success  is  market  belief  thatArgentina will  benefit  from exports  to  the  much  larger Brazilianbased  on  that  assumption,  and  the  future  of  Mr. Cavallo'sconvertibility plan in  turn depends  on private  investment.  Now, theseforeign risks  may remain risks  and not  realities,  and  let  us  ferventlyhope  that  is  the  case.  However,  the  existence  of  these risks  is  ofparticular concern as  our  domestic economy passes through  the  presentadjustment process  when it  is  especially sensitive  to  shocks.  Thankyou, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, most  of  the  recent slowing  in  theTwelfth District  economy has been  in  fast  growing  states,  includingArizona, Idaho, Nevada,  and Oregon.  California has  experienced  lessof  a slowdown than  other  states  and  continues  to  expand at  a moderatepace, but  from depressed levels.  Several  large  local governmentswithin  the  state  of  California need  to  establish a path to  longer-termsolvency.  Los  Angeles  County recently proposed to  curtailexpenditures  severely.Orange  County is  working  to  avert  a short-term  liquiditycrisis,  but  it  is  having difficulty resolving its  insolvency.  BecauseOrange  County voters  rejected a proposed sales  tax  increase,additional  measures  such  as  cuts  in county spending will  be required.These  recent  developments  have had surprisingly  little  impact  on othermunicipal  issuers  in  California.  However,  a persistent premium  onCalifornia state  debt  suggests  that  the market  expects  the county'sproblems  eventually to  revert in  part  to  the  state.Turning  to  the  national economy,  I am somewhat  morepessimistic about  the  second quarter  than  the  Greenbook.  Our monthlyindicators model  suggests  that  real  GDP  declined at  a rate  between1 and 2 percent  in  the  second quarter.  It  appears  that  a good deal  ofthis weakness reflects  a small  drop  in  final  sales.  While  the  economyis  flirting with recession,  it  seems more  likely that  real  GDP andfinal  sales  will  increase  somewhat  in  the  third quarter  and growmoderately over  the  next  year and a half.  Our  staff  has used ourstructural model  to  try to  make  sense  of  the  unexpected surge  ingrowth last  year, which has been  followed by surprising weaknessrecently.  They found  that  in  the  latter  half  of  1994  householdspending  came  in well  above  levels predicted by historicalrelationships  with  income, interest  rates,  and other  variables.7/5-6/95-16-Developments  in  the  second  quarter  seem  to  bring  these  relationshipsback more  into  line  so  that  the  recent  declines may have been  ineffect  a payback  for  earlier  strength  in  household  spending.  Onepartial  explanation  could be  that  consumers  accelerated purchases  tolock  in  interest  rates  in  a period of  rising  rates.  There  certainlywere  anecdotal  reports  of  this  happening  in  the  housing market  in1994.Finally, I might  note  that  we have  raised our  inflationforecast  a bit  for  1995,  based on  developments  so  far  this year, butwe have  marked it  down a little  for  1996  in  view of  the excesscapacity that  is  likely  to  develop  later  this  year  and the recentoutlook seems  to have  improved in  our view  since we met  in May.  Thankyou, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, the  economic  data for New Englandas  for the  nation  indicate at  least  a pause  in  the recovery.  Theanecdotal  evidence  is  more positive.  In  sum,  total  employment,housing activity, and confidence  indexes have  weakened in  the  region.However,  the  jobless  rate  continues  to  drop.  Inflation on both theprice and the  wage side  remains well  in  check.  And many manufacturingcontacts describe  themselves  as wavering between hopeful  optimism andwatchful  concern as  they contrast  their  own  order books  with mediareports  on  the national  situation.Moving  to  a little  bit  of  detail:  Employment  in  the  regionfell  in  May with  the  weakness concentrated  in  construction andmanufacturing.  Services  and  trade,  which  have  accounted  for most  ofthe  job  growth we have  had in  this  recovery, also  had a relativelyweak May.  Despite  the  lack of  job growth,  the  regional  unemploymentrate was  5.2  percent  in May.  A decline  in  the  regional  labor  force  isone reason  for  the  apparent  inconsistency between  the weak job  figuresand  the  low unemployment  rate.  Consumer  confidence  in  New England hasthis a bit, business  confidence  in  the region  also  deteriorated quitesharply  in June according to  a survey of  Massachusetts companies,though  it  still  remains  above  the  level  consistent with optimism onthe part of  more  than half  of  those  surveyed.  So,  consumer confidencehas  dropped quite  a bit more  sharply.  Business  confidence  haswith  some  optimism.Our  informal  discussions  with area  manufacturers andretailers  again have  a somewhat more positive tone.  Manufacturers inparticular report good growth  in  shipments, and  several high-techcompanies  in  the  electronics  and medical areas  are planning  largehires.  Nevertheless,  there  are  some  companies  that  see  evidence ofslowing and the performance of  the  auto  industry  in particular  isbeing followed very closely.  The retail  situation is  mixed.  Theweaker performers may be more  representative  of  the  general  state  ofthe  regional  economy.  Our  retail  respondents  who are  doing well  seemeither to  be gaining market  share  or  sellers  of  specialty products.7/5-6/95-17-Lastly,  since  the  latest  national  data  on  new home  sales  wereso  strong  and  I reported  the  last  time  that  there was  a better picturein New  England on  home  sales  in  general,  I would note  that  our  latesthousing market  data  in New England  have  been quite  sluggish,  thoughagain  that  is  not without  its  bright  side.  Some  contacts  have  noticeda pickup  in  sales  in  the  past  month.On  the national  scene,  we  are  largely  in  agreement  with  theGreenbook  forecast  this  time  around.  Based on  information  to  date,  wesee  inflation, particularly  for  the  last part of  1995,  a little  higherthan  the  Greenbook  is  forecasting.  All  in all,  we  find  the baselineGreenbook  forecast appealing, but  we  are  concerned about  the  risks  tothat  forecast  and, given  those  risks,  how we  should be  looking  atpolicy going  forward.  That  is  the  subject  for  later  on in  thediscussion.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Overall,  the  Philadelphia  District  economy isflat  to  down, probably down  in  the  second quarter going  into  thethird.  Manufacturing has  been the  hardest  hit,  more  so  than  in  thenation as  a whole.  There  is  a tentative  sense  among Districtmanufacturers that  the  bottom may be  near and  that an  upturn  is  in  theoffing during the  fourth quarter and into  1996.  Most  say a healthyexport business  to  Europe  and  Southeast Asia  is  cushioning thedownturn  in  domestic demand.  Housing activity appears  to  beresponding positively  to  lower mortgage rates,  although  the  level  ofactivity  is  still  down  from a year ago.  Retailers  say  sales  are  upbut  below expectations.  They are  cautious  about  the  rest  of  the  year.They say  that  a period of  pent-up demand has passed and  customers  areagain more  susceptible  to  postponing purchases.  Retailers  look  to  acontinuation  of  discounting  to  keep  sales  growing.  Loan demand  atbanks  is  soft  and most bankers  say  their customers  are more  cautiousthan  several months  ago.  The  region has  been hit with more majorcorporate downsizings,  which make  for  headline news,  and thesedownsizings  greatly outdistance  interest  rates  as  a matter of  generalconcern.  There are  still  a  lot  of  help-wanted signs  in  the region,  atretail  shops  as  an  example,  but  they are mostly  for lower-paying  jobs.Wage  and price pressures remain subdued.  My sense  is  thatexpectations  in  the District  about  whether the  economy is  headed  for arecession  or  a rebound are in a sensitive  stage.  Business peoplegenerally are cautiously predicting a bounceback, but  thesepredictions are  vulnerable to  shocks  or  continued signs  of  weakness.Expectations  could change quickly.  Consumers  seem more  cautious  thanbusinesses,  judging  from comments  from  retailers.Turning to  the nation,  I think the  most  likely outcome is  aresumption of  growth,  although  the  risks  of  a self-feeding  downturnclearly have  increased  significantly for  all  the  reasons  that we havediscussed.  There  is  little room at  this  point to  absorb  additionaldownside  developments  without causing  a recession.  These downsidedevelopments  are easily imaginable.  They may occur  if  we don't  get  arebound  in  exports,  say,  because of  less growth abroad as  detailed byPresident McDonough.  Consumer or  business  confidence may deterioratemuch further  as  recession talk  increases, and one can  add to  thatlist.  We  could conceivably get  a much stronger rebound in  the  economythan  expected for  the  opposite reasons,  but  this  outcome  seems  to  meto  be  much less  likely at  this  point.  As  for  inflation,  there  has7/5-6/95-18-been an uptick  in  cyclical  inflationary  pressures.  However, with wagepressures  subdued  and price  competition  intense against  a backgroundof  timely monetary restraint  earlier,  we  still  appear  to  be  on  trackfor  achieving price  stability  over  time.

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I would  like  to  takejust  a couple  of  extra minutes  tomorrow when we  talk about  the  longer-term  strategy  of policy, so  I'll  try to  make  these  economic  commentsthis afternoon as  brief  as  I can.As  our Beigebook report  indicated, our  three  latest monthlymail  surveys  of  retail,  service  sector, and manufacturing activity allindicated somewhat  slower growth  in these  key sectors  in  our region  inthe  tone  of  the  anecdotal  comments  at  our June  board meeting,  at  whichwe  invite not  only the  Richmond directors but  also  our Charlotte  andBaltimore branch  directors,  somewhat  more bullish and  at  least  mildlyencouraging.  On  the  whole,  I would  say  they  suggested that  businessactivity in our  District may be bottoming out  and getting poised  for abit  of  a revival  going forward.  Our  regional anecdotal  tidbit of  themonth is  that  the  recent  closing  of  Pennsylvania  Avenue is  going tocost  the  D.C. Government  about  $3/4  million  in parking meter  fees.  Idon't know what  that  implies  for  the  fund rate,  but  that's  a  fact  forwhatever  it's  worth.Regarding  the national  picture, as  I think  I have mentionedbefore, we  use a VAR model  in  developing our Humphrey-Hawkinsprojections  and  this  time  our projections  are  very  close to  theGreenbook's  except  for  inflation;  we  are  on the  high side  there.  Weare  showing  about  1/2  percentage point  more CPI  inflation  in  both  1995and  1996--to be specific,  3.5  percent  for  1995,  which  I think  is  theupper  limit  of  the  estimates  you received  from the  members,  Mike,  and3.3  percent  for  1996.  Even  allowing for  the rising  inflation in  ourforecast,  I would say  that  both the  Greenbook projections  and ourprojections  in a sense  are pretty  rosy, at  least  from here  on  out.They both say  that  real  growth hit  its  low point  and  inflation hit  itshigh point  in  the  second quarter, and  they both project  rising outputand  employment  and generally declining  inflation going  forward.Frankly,  this gives  me  a little pause since,  as we  all  know, rosyscenarios  often don't play out.  In  general,  along with my  staff,  Istill  think  the  risks  are pretty well  balanced, but  I have  to  confessthat  I am  still worried about  the  downside risks  on  the  real  side.  Ithink the recent  weakness in  employment  and income growth could feedback  into  spending.  Moreover,  a slowing economy is  always  morevulnerable  to  downside  risks,  and I think  Bill  McDonough's  commentsabout  the  downside risks  in  the  external  sector  are reasonably welltaken.  Against  that background,  I very much hope  that  the  Juneemployment  report  is  a little brighter than  the  last  two.One  final  comment  I would make  on  the  financial  side--I  thinkthe  15  basis point  jump  in  the  long bond rate  in  response  to  that  newhomes sales  report  in May was  remarkable.  It  was,  to  be  sure,  a verylarge  jump.  But  this  is  a series  that  everybody knows  is  unusuallyvolatile  and it  usually does  not  get  anything like  that kind ofreaction  in bond markets.  I think that  reaction  indicates  how supersensitive  even the  longest-term  inflation expectations  are  to7/5-6/95-19-relatively small bits  of  information.  That  suggests  to  me  that weneed  to  provide  a firmer  anchor  for  these  longer-term  expectations  andI'd  like  to  come back  to  that  tomorrow  if  I may.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well  done!  President  Forrestal.

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  recent  indications  ofeconomic  activity in  the  Atlanta District  are  fairly mixed, but  theimportant  housing and manufacturing sectors  are beginning  to  show  somesigns  of  accelerating.  Employment  growth has pretty much  leveled offin  the District,  although District unemployment  rates  generally remainbelow  those  for  the  nation as  a whole.  The  retailers  in  the  Districthave  met most  of  their  expectations,  at  least  in  most parts  of  theregion, and merchants  are  fairly optimistic  about  the  third quarter.Apparel  sales,  for  example,  have  improved but  sales  of  household goodshave slowed  down.  Throughout  the  District  auto  sales  remain weakerthan  they were  a year ago.  Tourism  is  strengthening in  the  District,with only central Florida  remaining somewhat  weak.  Manufacturers'shipment  and production activities have  increased recently, but  thenumber of  contacts  reporting that  they have  added to  payrolls hasproducers  is  cooling, but  export  demands  remain pretty good  in  thatsector and are bolstering production, and chemical  and plasticshipments  also  continue  to be  quite strong.  Apparel production  issteady for  some products  but demand has  fallen  off  for  othercategories.  This  is  resulting  in  slowing factory activity  in  thatarea.  Building-related producers  of  such  items  as  carpets  and lumberare reporting  some  slowing.  Residential  building  is  also  slowing inthe  region and builders  are quite  cautious, but  realtors  areoptimistic;  that  is  a change.  I thought realtors  were alwayspessimistic, but  apparently  they are not  at  the moment.  Realtors  arereporting  that  single-family home  sales  are  up  for May and  early June,and  they attribute much of  this  rebound  to  lower mortgage  rates.  Homeinventory shortages  are reported  in  very few of  our markets.Multifamily  construction  continues  to  increase with  rising rentalrates  and  occupancies,  although realtors anticipate  that  the  rate  ofincrease  in  rental  rates  should  slow  in most  areas  of  the  District.Nonresidential  construction also  continues  to  increase,  with risingrental  rates  and  occupancies  now notably  spreading into  industrialspace.Lending activity throughout  the  District  again is  quitemixed.  Demand for  auto  loans and most  other  types  of  consumer  loansis  generally soft,  but  commercial  and industrial  loan  demand isstrengthening.  Wages  remain essentially unchanged throughout  theDistrict, and we  continue to  get  scattered reports  of  shortages  ofskilled workers, particularly construction  workers  in Tennessee.  Aswas  the  case at  the  time of  the  last  FOMC meeting,  fewer manufacturersthan before  reported higher prices  for both materials  and  finishedproducts, although we are  getting reports  from  industrial  contactsthat materials prices  charged by paper, plastic,  tire,  and chemicalproducers continue  to  go  up.  Though I said at  the  outset  that  I thinkthe picture  is  decidedly mixed, the  anecdotal  information  that we  aregetting  from our directors  and other  business people  is  definitelyvery, very cautious,  a little  bit  on the  pessimistic  side.With respect  to  the national  economy, our  outlook shows  apickup  in growth toward  the end  of  the  year  and we  expect  that  growth7/5-6/95-20-to  continue  in  1996.  For that  reason we  are  somewhat more optimisticon  the  growth side  than  the Greenbook,  and naturally with  that  kind  offorecast  our employment  gains  are  a little better.  On  the  other hand,we  show very little  improvement  in  inflation.  Now, some of  thesedifferences  might be  accounted  for  by  the  fiscal  policy assumptions  inthe  Greenbook  that  we don't  have  in  our  forecast,  and that wouldminimize  the differences  in  the  two  forecasts.  I think both  forecastsare  similar  in  that  they view the  current  slowdown  as  a mid-cyclepause  rather  than  the  onset  of  a recession.  I think  that both  ofthese  forecasts  are  reasonable  and within  the  usual  range of  forecasterrors.  But  I must  say  that  I continue  to  be  disturbed by theincoming data, which are below the  expectations  that  we had earlier.Clearly, as many people have  indicated,  the  risk  of  recession hasrisen.  It's  not difficult  to  imagine,  as  Ed Boehne has  suggested,that  this  decline  in  industrial production  and weak employment  couldlead  to  a decided  softening in demand.  And built  into  at  least  someof  our earlier  forecasts  was greater  growth in  our  trading partners,particularly  in western Europe.  And  as  Bill McDonough and others havepointed  out,  that may be an  optimistic  view at  this  point  since we  arelooking at  a lower  rate  of  growth in those  countries.  To  sound likean economist,  I would  say on  the  other hand  [Laughter]  that underlyingconditions  are not  unfavorable  in  the  economy.  The  imbalances  that wehad during the  last recession clearly  are not present;  household andcorporate balance  sheets are much better,  the banking  system is  inrelatively good shape.  While  we do  have  an inventory overhang, thatseems  to  be  in  the  process  of  being corrected.  As  I look  at  theentire picture,  I think  a recession is  probably not  the  most  likelyoutcome, but  I think  that  the  risks  are  definitely on  the  down side.Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Tenth District  economy remainsmoderately strong, but  signs  of  slowing have  emerged in  recent  monthsas  I reported earlier.  For  example,  District  employment  growth  slowedin March and  actually  turned down slightly in April  and May, and thestill  almost  3 percent higher  than  a year  earlier, and  ourunemployment  levels  across  the  states  are  consistently below thenational  average.  In  addition  to  slow employment  growth, activity  inthe  energy industry remains weak  in  our  region, and  the  farm  economyhas been hurt  recently by unfavorable weather  and weak prices.  Otherindicators,  though, point to  continued underlying strength in  ourDistrict.  In construction, we  have had recent  job losses,  but  anupturn in  housing permits  and other  construction  contracts  suggeststhe  decline will  be  reversed in  the months  ahead.  In manufacturing,our  survey of  recent  conditions  indicates  that  this  sector  continuesto  expand, albeit  at  a somewhat slower pace.  District manufacturersalso  indicate  that  they still  are  operating at  relatively high ratesof  capacity use.  Retail  sales  other than  automobiles  have beenholding up quite  well  in recent  months.  Moreover,  retailers  aregenerally optimistic  about  their  prospects,  although some  inventorytrimming has  occurred.  Confirming some  of  this  underlying strength inthe District,  loan  growth at  our banks  remained relatively strong  inthis  backdrop, wage and price pressures are  easing to  some  extent.  Weare  seeing price  increases  in  raw materials  and manufacturing and westill  have  some  shortages  in  labor  in District markets.  But price7/5-6/95-21-increases  for  finished goods  have moderated  and prices  remainrelatively stable  on  the  retail  side.On  the  national  front,  our  projections  are  relatively similarto  those  of  the  Greenbook.  We believe  the  economy  is  going  through  apause  and an  adjustment  phase  right  now.  We  expect  that  there will  bea couple  of  quarters  of  growth below trend,  but  at  the  current  levelof  fed funds  we would  also  expect  the  economy  to  return  to  growth nearpotential by the  fourth quarter and  into next  year.  This  view  isbased on  the  fact  that  the  fundamental  determinants  of  consumerspending and business  fixed investment  are  positive.  The  outlook  fornet  exports,  while  less  robust  than  earlier  thought,  remains  generallysound.  Inventory excesses  do not  appear  large enough  to  require  aprolonged correction.  This  outlook permits  the  labor market  and theindustrial  sector to  return gradually to  levels  of  activity consistentwith more  stable  inflation.  We are  looking  for  inflation  to  be  cappedat  about  3-1/4  percent, which  is  not  quite  as  optimistic  as  theGreenbook.  Looking  beyond that,  we  see  continued growth near  theeconomy's potential  in  1996.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, reports  from  our District  ccntactshave been more mixed lately.  While economic  conditions  in certainsectors  of  the  District  continue  to  show signs  of  slowing, some  pickupin  activity was  reported in  other  industries.  Reports  from  ourcontacts in  the  automobile  industry and, of  course,  today'sannouncements  indicate  that  autos  and  light  truck sales  in June movedslightly above  May's  annual  rate  of  14-1/2  million units,  but not  upto  the  15  million units  that  we  were expecting  just  a few weeks ago.I think that's  because  of  lower  sales  at  one  of  the  Big  Three andlower  expected sales  at  one of  the  foreign nameplates  that  has  not yetannounced its  sales.  I don't  view this  as  a pervasive,  industry-wideslowing  in  the  last  couple of  weeks  in June.  I think  the  slowing  ismore  focused  in  those  two  companies.  And, as  Mike mentioned, Chryslerhas not  yet announced, but  we  are expecting  its  sales  to  be  up 11  to12  percent;  of  course,  that  number  is  confidential until  it  isannounced.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think Chrysler has  announced itssales.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  You have the  numbers!

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  They  announced today?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  The  Chrysler numbers,  seasonallyadjusted by the  Fed,  went  from a rate  of  2.22  million  in  May to  2.43million in June.  According to  Dixon Tranum, our  analyst,  that puts  arough  estimate of  total  sales  in  June up  slightly  from the  seasonallyadjusted May  level.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Is  this  the  first month that  Chrysler had  the newminivans?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't think  they have  the new minivans.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.They are  out.7/5-6/95-22-

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I hope  this  is  not  going  to  throw the  seasonalsoff.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Of  course,  they  are  the  one  company  that haswidespread  incentives  for both  their  cars  and  their  light  trucks  now.None  of  the  other  manufacturers has  incentives  across  the  board.Despite  the  production cuts  so  far,  it  is  likely that  inventories  atthe  end  of  June  remained near  the  70-day  supply  that  existed at  theend  of  May.  This year's  weakness  in  light vehicle  sales  may reflectfactors  other than  overall  consumer demand because  the  total number  oflight vehicles  sold, including both new and used vehicles,  actuallyhas  risen  slightly this  year from  last  year.  I think an  importantfactor  is  the  rise  in  the  supply of  used vehicles  coming off  lease,and  this  trend is  going  to  continue  to  accelerate in  future years  aswell.  In  addition, despite the  incentives  on new vehicles,  relativelyhigh prices and  finance  company auto  loan  rates may be  shifting demandfrom new vehicles  to  used vehicles.  Orders  for heavy duty trucks  areexhibiting  signs  of  weakness.  However, the  back orders  remain quitehigh and  cancellations have  not  picked up.  On a seasonally adjustedbasis, heavy duty  truck production  in  the  third quarter  is  planned tobe  about  even with  the  first  and second  quarters  of  1995.For  other manufacturing firms,  particularly in  the consumerdurables  sector,  inventory pruning has  been a major  factorconstraining production, but we  do  not  believe  that  operating  ratesare  falling  to  recessionary  levels.  Industry reports  have  indicatednoticeable reductions  in  order  backlogs  for heavy  equipment,  furtherslowing  of  durable  goods  production, and planned  cuts  in  overtime andweekend  operations  and  in  temporary workers.  One  large producer ofheavy equipment  has  seen  a drop  in  the number of  their models  onallocation  from 30  to  15  in  the  past  few months  but,  of  course,  theystill  have  15  models  on  allocation at  this  point.  Indeed, producersof  construction  equipment believe  that  orders  and probably productionpeaked in  the  second  quarter, and  firms  are  now focusing  on managingthe  expected economic  slowdown.  One  District appliance maker  reportedcutting  production and workers  in May and June  in  an effort  to  trimfactory inventories  accumulated  earlier when  sales  were  softening.But  this  contact  also noted  that  the  inventory adjustment  by appliancedealers  appears  to  have  been  short-lived.  For  the  industry as  awhole,  factory  shipments  of  appliances  strengthened  in May andstrengthened  again  in June.  Purchasing managers'  surveys  in  ourDistrict  indicate  slowing  activity overall,  with  the  latest  Chicagosurvey dropping to  its  lowest  level  since June  1992.  On the  consumerside,  although reports  were mixed, most retailers  in  the Districtreport  that sales  growth improved in May and  again  in  June on  aseasonally adjusted basis.  Reports  from  several national  retailersreflected less  concern about  inventory positions  than  in previousmonths,  although  some  added that  stocks  were  still  above  desiredlevels.  Others  indicated an  inventory buildup  at  specialty anddiscount retailers  as  a result  of  deteriorating sales.We have not  yet  seen a widespread revival  in  the housingsector,  although realtors and homebuilders  are  optimistic  and thereare  increasing signs  that lower mortgage  interest  rates  are beginningto  have  an  impact  on activity.  In  agriculture,  weather-related delaysduring the spring planting season  trimmed this  year's  crop  acreagefrom  initial  intentions  and  increased  the  odds  that per  acre yieldswill  be  reduced by other problems  during the  growing  season.  Because7/5-6/95of  the  increased chances  of  a significant  tightening  in  supplies,grain prices  have  risen  sharply and  are  likely  to  remain  quitevolatile  for  the  rest  of  the  summer.Although the  labor markets  in  the  District  remain relativelytight,  slowing  economic  growth had tempered demand  for workers  andsome  easing  of  wage  pressures  was  reported.  Our  average unemploymentrate  in  the  Seventh District  is  5 percent now compared,  of  course,  tothe  5.7  percent  rate nationally.  On  the price side,  reports  generallyhave  indicated some  abatement  in upward pressures, mainly in  inputprices.  Reports  of  renegotiations  of  earlier  steel price hikescontinue to  surface.  Of  course,  the planned July  increase  is  widelyexpected not  to  go  into  effect.  The  auto parts producers  arereporting renewed pressures  from  the Big Three  to  cut  prices.  Energyprices in  the  District have  eased, partly due  to  soft  demand.  Freighthaulers  report  competition for  slower business  is  pushing down  rates.One notable  exception  is  paper and paper products,  where pricescontinue  to  move up.Overall,  we agree  with  the  Greenbook that  the  current  outlookis  for  slower growth  in  1995  rather  than a recession.  Even  though thesecond quarter may be worse  than  the Greenbook  forecast,  as  long  assome key expenditure  categories  do not  turn sour,  especially businessfixed  investment,  1995  should not  yield  to  recession.  While  the  coreCPI  has  increased at  an  average annual  rate  of  3.8  percent  so  far  thisyear, we  agree with the  Greenbook that  the  inflation outlook  isimproving.  There  remains  substantial  uncertainty about  the  actuallevel  of  inflation, but  the  expected path  is  one  of  improvement.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  As  has been noted, there  has  beena mix of  positive  and negative  indicators  of U.S.  economic performancerecently,  and  it  is  not  easy  to  know what  such  indicators portend  forthe  future.  It's  my opinion,  however,  that  the  economy has  enjoyed avery balanced expansion  since  its  cyclical  trough  in March  1991,weathering major changes  in  federal  spending and corporaterestructuring.  Like  the  Board staff,  I am inclined to  think  that  therecent  spate  of  negative  indicators  reflects a pause  in  the  currentcyclical  expansion rather  than the  onset  of  a recession.  We  areforecasting real  GDP growth  in  the  range  of  1-1/2  to  2 percent  thisyear, with  such growth  returning to  near  its potential  in  1996.  Withan appropriate  monetary policy I also  believe  that  inflation coulddrift  down  from current  levels  in  1996,  although we would still be  agood distance  away from price  stability.  On  the  positive  side,  thefinancial  indicators are generally looking  good.  The  equities marketis  riding high, and  long-term  interest rates  are down  significantlyfrom  their peaks  of  last November.  Indeed,  there  are indications  thatinvestment  spending, including housing,  and durable  goods  may beresponding positively to  lower  long-term interest  rates.  Bank  lendingis  strong,  and in  the  Eighth  District  loan quality is  very high.  Overthe  economy as  a whole, bank  lending  is  being  reflected in  anextraordinary increase-in  the  broad monetary aggregates, which on alonger-term basis  are roughly  linked to  demand growth  and  inflation.There  are  few signs of  structural  imbalance.  The ratio  of  inventoriesto  final  sales  remains  low;  the consumer  installment  debt delinquencyrate  is  near a 20-year  low;  and the  ratio  of  debt  service  todisposable  income  is  well  below peak  levels  reached  in  the  late  1980s.7/5-6/95-24-Furthermore,  the  value  of  the  dollar has  declined significantly inreal  terms,  so  much  so  that  U.S.  goods  and  services  must  certainlylook  like bargains  in  the world market.  I expect  that  this  willstimulate  domestic production  later  this  year  and  into  1996.Although growth  in  the  Eighth  District has  slowed,  theDistrict  economy remains  strong.  Unemployment  in  District  statescontinues  at  well  under  the  national  average,  and employment  hascontinued to  grow in  both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing.District  firms  producing prefabricated metal buildings, mobile homes,and  furniture  are  experiencing  strong demand.  Perhaps  this  sayssomething about  the durables  sector.  Currently,  foreign markets  areproviding good outlets  for  the  products  of  many District  firms,  butsharp  increases  in  import  prices  are  adding to  costs.  In  the  EighthDistrict, we  see  little  letup  in pressures  to  raise prices.  Wecontinue  to receive  anecdotal  evidence  that qualified workers are  inshort  supply.  Most contacts  in  our  District  report rising costs  andsome  moderate wage pressures.Given  this  outlook,  I am more concerned about  long-runinflation  than  the  prospect of  a sustained decline  in  output.  CPIinflation  accelerated to  3-1/2 percent  during the  first half  of  1995.Such an  enormous  amount  of  liquidity was  added  to  the  economy in  1991through 1993  that  I remain concerned whether  our restrictive policystance  since  then has  been sufficient  to  cap  inflation and makefurther progress  toward price  stability.  In my opinion,  the  declinesin  inflation and inflation  expectations  have  contributed  to  thecurrent  expansion.  Comparatively low  inflation has  kept U.S.  outputcompetitive  in both  foreign  and domestic  markets.  Moreover, thecredibility--the point Al  Broaddus was  talking  about  before--hasreduced uncertainty, encouraged  investment,  and enhanced productivity.A continuation  of  the  downward  trend  in  long-run  inflation  isessential  for  achieving maximum sustainable  economic  growth.

MR. MCTEER.  Growth in  the  Dallas  District  has  slowedconsiderably  from  the pace  earlier  in  the year,  but we  are  stillseeing positive  employment  growth.  With high  levels  of  resourceutilization still  being the  norm, the attitudes of  our  directors,Beigebook contacts,  and others  remain fairly good.  I might  say thatwhile  our directors  read the  same  newspapers as  everybody else  andare  aware  of  the  weakening  in  the national  economy,  their  anecdotalstories are more positive than what  they are reading.  The  drop  inmortgage rates  is  beginning  to  have  a positive  impact  on buildingpermits,  single-family housing  starts,  and  forecasts  of  real  estateactivity for  later  in  the year  in  our District.  The  impact  of  thepeso  devaluation, while  it  has been  serious  for  our District,  has beenmitigated by  several  special  circumstances.  One  is  a surge  in petro-chemical exports  that has  helped especially the  Houston economy  inrecent months.  Another  is  a pickup  in  foreign demand for  computersand electronics  components  produced in  our District.  Also,  the weakerpeso  has helped  the Maquiladora  industry along  the  Texas-Mexicoborder.  El  Paso  is  particularly a beneficiary and  is  having goodoverall  employment  growth despite  the  very weak  retail markets  in  thearea right  along  the  border.  So,  while export  growth has  slowed  fromwhat  it  likely would have  been had  exports  to  Mexico continued  to  grow7/5-6/95-25-at  their  1994  pace,  our  overall  exports  have  continued  to  growsufficiently  to  offset  some  of  the  weakening in  domestic  demand.  Ourdirectors  continue  to  report  exceptionally easy  credit  standardsthroughout  the  District,  which probably have  reduced  the  effectivecost  of bank  credit  and made  the  impact  of  current  short-term ratessomewhat  less  restrictive  than we might  normally  expect.On  the national  side we  have  no  major  arguments  with  theGreenbook.

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As at  the  last  fewmeetings,  I wanted to  give  a  fiscal policy update,  and  I havedistributed a table  to  the members  of  the  Committee.  I think  thetable carries  with it  several  messages.  First,  I would refer you  to  acomparison of  the  two  columns  labeled  "1995  Enacted" and  "1996  602BAllocation."  The  602B allocations  are  given by  the budget  committeesto  the various  appropriations  committees,  and  this  is  the  amount ofmoney  they  can divide up  for  actual  spending.  I think  the  first  thingthat  is  instructive  is  that  the  basis  for  comparison on  this  table  isnominal  1995  levels  of  spending.  We are not  cutting  from  somebaseline  that  includes growth;  we  are  cutting  from  1995  nominals.  Theamount  of  the  cut  is  just  shy  of  $22  billion.  This  is  not mandatoryspending;  in  other words,  Medicare  is  not  in  here;  Medicaid  is  not  inhere;  food  stamps  are not  in  here.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Social  Security?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Oh yes,  Social  Security is  not  in  here;interest payments  are  not  in  here.  These  are real-money-out-the-doortypes  of programs.  The  $22  billion  figure  roughly contrasts  with  thediscretionary number  of  $18  billion that  is  in  the  Greenbook.  Thefact  that these  cuts  are  from  a nominal  level  leads  me  to  make  someadjustment  to  see  just  how much  contraction  is  occuring.  If  wethought  that  real  spending should  be  roughly constant  next  year, wewould need to  have  an  idea of  GDP  in  1996  and we would  at  least wantto  assume  some kind of  constancy in  real  spending and perhaps a littleabove that.  If  we  add a  3 percent  inflation factor,  we  really arecutting  real  spending by something on  the  order of  $37  billion asopposed to  $21  billion,  and  that  is  before we  get  to  the  Medicareadjustments.The  second observation I would make--we have  a small  sampleof  only five  subcommittees  on the  table  here--is  that  four  of  the  fivesubcommittees  have  cut  more  than  their  602B  allocations.  These  areappropriations subcommittees  that  refer back  to  the  AppropriationsCommittee.  I can't  remember  this  ever happening before.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  reason you don't  remember  is  that  ithas  not happened.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It  hasn't happened, yes.  The  chairmen  of  thesesubcommittees  often  are  called  the  13  cardinals.  If  you have  aproblem, no matter what party you belong to,  you go  to  one of  thecardinals  and their  job  is  to  take  care  of  your post  office  or your7/5-6/95-26-road  or something  like  that.  Needless  to  say, when  they  are upagainst  a 602B  allocation they manage  to  spend  all  the money.Otherwise,  they  don't  keep  their  robes  very  long  or  whatever,  I don'tknow what  the  analogy would be.  So,  four  of  the  five committees  thathave  come  in have  cut  below their  602B  allocations.  The  only thing  Ican  read  into that  is  that  there  is  perhaps  more political  seriousnessthan  is  usually  the  case.The  third  thing  to  keep  in  mind  here  is  that  what  is  beingbalanced  is  that  one has  to  successfully  logroll  to  get  a majorityamong  two  different  groups  of  people.  The Budget  Committeeallocations  involve  one group  of people,  but  they  don't really haveresponsibility here.  These  appropriations  committee people  areanother  group, and  the  fact  that  they  are managing to  get  majoritiesin both  is  very, very  instructive.  Basically, these  are  going throughon party-line votes.  So,  the  amount  of  cohesion  is  quite high.  This,of  course,  is  very, very early  in  the  process.  We  go  from here  to  theSenate  and  then  to  a conference  and  then  to  the  presidential veto,  butso  far  I would say that  the Appropriations  Committee actions  suggestthat  deficit  reduction  is  at  least  on  track.  Perhaps  we  are  seeingsome  reductions  below 602B  allocations  to  have  as  bargaining chipslater  on.  You have  to  have  something else  you are willing to  cut  inorder  to  get your program back.  But  I think  it  is  very, very strikingthat  we  are  truly in  a new world,  as  the  Chairman  just noted.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you, quite  interesting.  PresidentStern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  District  economycontinues  to  do  reasonably well  based on  the  available objectivemeasures.  There are  some  problems  in  agriculture  related  to  weather,but  otherwise  things  seem  to  be moving  along reasonably well.  Acouple of  bright reports  have  come  in  recently.  One  is  a firm with  alarge mortgage  banking operation  that  says  business has  been  quitegood  recently and  the  improvement  is  only partially related  torefinancing activity.  And a  large  appliance and electronics  retailersays  that  business has  held up well.  Having  said  that,  I think  thereis  a sense  of  disappointment  in  some parts  of  the  District,  and it  isnot because  activity has  contracted  in  an absolute  sense.  I think  ithas more  to  do with what  people thought  this year's  business growthmight  turn out  to  be  for  their  firms,  what  they  took  to  be  a  trend asopposed to  what economists might  consider  trend rates  of  growth  and soforth.  Actual  developments  just have  not  lived up  to  those morefavorable expectations.  I think  there  is  some  of  that  going on.With regard to  the  national  economy,  I do have  some  concerns.First,  I will  talk briefly about  some  things  that  don't  concern me.Our model  is  also  a VAR model.  We  update  it  as  new data becomeavailable and it  is  giving us  a  forecast not  precisely equivalent  tothat  of  the  Greenbook, but  not very  different--a  continuation ofmodest  growth and some  slowing  in  inflation  over  time.  What  strikesme about  the forecast  is  that  the most  recent  run of  the  model  doesnot  differ very much, if  at  all,  from  the  run we  did prior  to  the  MayFOMC meeting.  So,  even  though  a lot  of  the  data  that have  come  in  onthe  national  economy in  that  intermeeting  period were  on  the  softside,  our model  continues  to  generate  the  same  forecast.  That  saysthat  either  those  numbers  are  consistent  with what  the model  in  somesense was  expecting or  there  have  been offsets.  The  offsets,  of7/5-6/95course,  could be  on  the  financial  side  because  of  the  continuedimprovement  in  the bond  and  stock markets.  In  some  sense  it  is  as  ifwe almost  have  an automatic  stabilizer working  in  the  bond market,with interest  rates  declining as  this  has  unfolded.  That,  as  Isuggested,  doesn't  concern me.What  does  concern me  are  some  other  things.  First  of  all,like  the  Greenbook, when we  interpolate  the  second quarter  we get  acontraction  in  activity;  and if  we go  back  and look  at  the  preliminaryGDP  data--not  the  data  that  are  finely smoothed and  reported severalyears  later--it's rare,  though not  wholly impossible,  to  find acontraction  in GDP  that  isn't  ultimately associated with a recession.I just  report that  as  a fact.  I don't  know what  its  implications  maybe  this  time  around.  What  concerns me  are  a couple of  things  thathave been mentioned.  One,  I share  Bill McDonough's  concerns  about  theforeign  situation.  I have  a sense  that we  have  looked at  the  sunnyside  of  a lot  of  those  economies  for  a  time,  and that  things  just arenot panning  out and have not  for a while,  and  I am concerned  aboutwhat  that  implies  for  domestic  activity.I am also  a little  suspicious  that  we may have  underestimatedthe  effects  of  the  1993  tax increase.  It's  not  just  that  tax paymentsapparently were much higher than  anticipated  in April  1995,  but  I cansee where  the  repercussions  of  that  may be more  important  than  I, atleast,  thought  earlier.Finally,  I am uneasy about  this  so-called  inventoryadjustment.  My experience  is  that  those  kinds  of  inventoryadjustments  never turn  out  to  be  as  quick  and as  easy and as  painlessas  we hope.  It  is  a truism  that  if  demand holds  up  they do  turn  outto  be relatively easy  and relatively painless, but  that  is  a big  "if."In  listening to  the  explanations  about  why demand might be expected  tohold up,  I agree  that  it  might well.  But  I don't  know that  I heardanything newly compelling  about  that,  and so  my concerns  are  notentirely assuaged as  I listen  to  those  explanations.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  The staff  at  Cleveland did a survey of  variouscompanies  across  the  District  on  the  subject  of  inventories.  The mainobjective  was  to  gauge  business sentiment  about  current  inventorylevels.  In  line with what Gary was  just  remarking, given theircomfort  levels with  their order books  and projected  sales,  ourbusiness  contacts  simply had no  complaints  about  their  inventories.They might  talk about  problems  relating  to  the  mix of  theirinventories,  sometimes  referring  to  thin  inventories  in  some  linesthat  were balanced by  too much  of  something else, but  they  did nothave  an overall  concern.  And that  was  just as  true of  manufacturingcompanies  as  it  was  of  retail  companies  and distributorships.What  has changed  in  the  last  few months  is  that  we  have heardfar  fewer  stories about  overworked workers--workers complaining abouttoo much overtime.  So  to  the  extent  that  there has been  anadjustment,  our anecdotal  information would suggest  a change  fromsomething  that was perceived as  being unsustainable to  something  thatis  much more  comfortable  all  the  way around.  We  recently had a jointmeeting with  all  three  of  our boards  and  the  reports  were  the mostremarkably uniform that  I have  heard yet  about  how well  things  are7/5-6/95-28-going  from the  standpoint  of  real  activity.  The  directors  expresspuzzlement over what  they read about  the  national  economy, but  I tookthat  to  mean  that  they  don't  understand the  difference between  firstand second  differences.  They  think  in  terms  of  the  level  of  theirfirm's  activity compared  to  a year  ago  and it  is  uniformly positive  inevery  respect.  They  do  not  see  things  as  we would in  the  sense  ofchanges  in  the  rate  of  change.There was  one new development  that  I thought was  significantand  that  was  their  expectations  about prices.  Except  for paper, whichBob Forrestal  also  mentioned--they say  that paper  is  a seriousproblem--there was  uniform agreement  in  line with  their  earlier viewsthat prices  are going  to  be  less of  a problem.  Steel  industry peoplesaid  that  the July 1st  price  increases  anticipated earlier simply didnot  happen, would not  happen, and in  fact  that  there  would probably besome  rollbacks  in  steel  prices.  They reported that  prices of  carbonsteel were  already being  rolled back.  Specialty steel people  saidthat  they had finished with  their  price  increases  for  this  year  andwere not planning  any price  increases  even for  the  first  of next  year.back from  an  international  trade  convention of  their  association,  andhe said  that  in  the  last  few months  there had been a dramatic  shift  inthinking about  prices  of  paints  and resins  and that  sort  of  thing--from expectations  that  firms  could get  further price  increases  toexpectations  that  prices would be  flat  for  the  balance  of  this  year.said  that  he had comeOn  the  labor markets,  sometimes when I think about  all  thatis  being said about  the  minimum number of  people  that are  not workingand how we have  to  maintain this  reservoir of  unemployed people,  Ifeel  I ought  to  come to  these  meetings  and  apologize because we  haveso  few people who are  not working  in  our District.  There  are  tencounties  in Kentucky and more  than  ten  counties  in Ohio  that  reportunemployment  rates  of  under  3 percent;  some  reports  are  down around 2percent  or  even  lower.  If  we have  so  few people  who are merelyconsuming  the product  of  other people  instead of  producing  somethingthemselves,  one might  conclude  that  maybe  we  are  going to  have  aninflation problem.  If  I thought  that  this  was  going to  lead  to  aproblem  of  cost push, wage push,  or  rising prices  I would be  asconcerned as  anybody  else, but  I simply don't  see  it.  In  trying  tofind  inflation out  there,  I mostly  get an  indication  that  theproductivity  increases that  are being sustained are warranting thekinds  of  demand  for  labor  that  our  firms  are  registering.  It  is  notthe  kind of  thing that  I think people have  looked  at  in previouscycles  as  a source  of  future  inflationary pressures.Turning  to  the  national  economy, when  I was  looking  at  theGreenbook  I was  pleased to  see  the  slight downward tilt  in  theinflation number  for  1996.  But  then Mike gave  us  Chart  18  showing  theranges  and  central  tendencies  of  the  FOMC  members'  forecasts,  and  thatleaves  me  still puzzled about  consistency.  The Greenbook projects  anupward  tilt in  intermediate- and long-term rates  this  year.  Itsuggests  that  the  absence of  some  downward adjustment  in  the  fundsrate  that  is  assumed  in  the  Greenbook will disappoint  the markets,  andso  longer-term rates will  go back up.  But  except  for  that kind of  alinkage, when  I look at  the  staff's nominal  GDP forecast  for  this  yearand next  year I don't understand why we  should have higherintermediate-  or  long-term rates  than  currently--not with  4.1 percentnominal  GDP growth  this year and  4.5  percent next  year.  If  anything,7/5-6/95rates  of  6-1/2  percent  on  30-year bonds  and  6-1/4  percent  on  10-yearissues  are  still  a bit  too  high  for  any sort  of  sustainableequilibrium.  But  when  I look  at  the  members'  forecasts  of  nominal  GDPfor  1996,  the  range goes  as  high as  6 percent,  and  if  that  kind offorecast  for  next year  and its  mix of  output  and  inflation  arecorrect,  then  the  consistency problem  is  in  the  intermediate-  andlonger-term  rates,  not  in  the  short-term rates.  If  the  centraltendencies  of  the members' projections--they  are  above the  Board  staffforecast--are  the best  guess  as  to  what  is  going  to  happen,  then  Iwould  think  that  the adjustment  has  to  be  in  the  shorter  end.  Icertainly don't  sense  any urgency  on  anybody's  part--the directors  ofour  boards  and other  people  that we  talk  to--that  we move  towardsomething  that would be perceived as  monetary stimulus, with  orwithout  an  idea about  needing  to  offset  some  fiscal  restraint.  Yet,  Ithink  that  very  few people would be  arguing  at  this  juncture  that  weought  to be moving to  what would be  a de  facto more  restrictive policystance.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, when the  economy is  experiencing  aslowdown, we  can't  be  comfortable about  its potential  length  or  depthuntil  it  is  over--and  this  slowdown is  not  over.  I feel  thatparticularly strongly  in  light  of  many  of  the  reports  that we  have hadaround the  table  so  far today.  But  that  said,  I still  have  to  be  onthe  more  sanguine  side  as  I watch the  data  that  come  through here.The  consumer does  not  look  as  if  he  is  scared  to  death.  Retail  saleshave come  back some  already, not  strongly, but nevertheless  they arenot  falling  any more.  Credit  is  still  flowing nicely, maybe  in  theview of  some a little  too  strongly.  With  regard to  the  surveys ofconsumer  confidence,  the  Michigan survey has  now  turned back up  just  alittle.  The Conference  Board survey  is  still  showing a littleweakness,  but both  surveys  are at  fairly high absolute  levels.Capital  spending was  certainly going  to  slow down  from  its  earlierpace,  and  I guess  it  has,  but  it  still  looks  good.  Orders  andbacklogs  are still  up.  Housing and autos  appear  to  be  stabilizing  onthe  most  recent  numbers  that we  have  received, and  certainly thestrong rally  in  long rates  has helped that.  The  stock market must  behelping  sentiment  and certainly the wealth effect  that goes  along withthat.  All  those  good things  being said, however,  it  is  hard to  findwhere  there  is  a strong growth engine  anywhere that  is  really going  tokick this  economy into  overdrive.  One  of  them  that  could have  donethat,  the  outlook  for  net  exports,  seems  to  be  increasingly  cloudy.When one  can't  find real  strength anywhere,  that  could, of  course,presage  further weakness.  But  it  does  seem  to me  that  the  odds areagainst  a deepening of  this  slowdown and  that  the  odds  favor aneconomy  that  is  coasting upward  toward a sustainable  growth rate.  Formy part,  I would put  that  rate  somewhat  above  that  in  the  Greenbook.Turning  to  inflation for  just  a minute,  the  battle  for pricelevel  stability certainly has  not been won yet,  but  I must  say that  Ifeel  better about  that  prospect than  I have  at  any time  I can recallsince  I have been here.  The  evidence  on  inflation and its  course  ispositive.  Everybody here  is  familiar with  that  evidence  so  I won'trecite it.  But it  does  look now as  if  inflation may be  peakingcyclically somewhere right  in  here.  If  so,  we  are entitled  to  takesome  satisfaction from  that.  It  would represent  considerable  progressboth in  terms of  a substantial  reduction and  also  the  fact  that  a7/5-6/95-30-secular downtrend has  been  going  on  for  a  long time  and is  continuing.To be  sure,  we  are  not at  price  level  stability and we have  to  keepour  sights  on  it.A couple  of  observations  if  I may:  Number  one,  I think thisCommittee  has  always  envisioned attaining price  level  stability as  aproject  to  be  accomplished over  some period  of  time.  If  in  fact  therate  of  inflation  is  peaking right  in  here  for  this  cycle,  that  willoccur at  a pretty  high  level  of  economic  activity.  I think most  of  usanticipate that we  are  going  to  go  back to  a sustainable  level  ofeconomic  growth  that  should not  kick off  any new inflationarypressures.  If  this  expectation  is  at  all  reasonable,  then  I think weare  in  a fairly comfortable position  for  the moment.  Second, I thinkit  is  of  key importance  that  we maintain  the  secular downward momentumtoward price  level  stability.  That  has  been in place  for  a number ofyears  now, and I think  it  still  is.  I believe  it  is  the number  oneduty of  this  Committee  to  make  sure  that  the  secular  downward trendcontinues  in place.  But  if  all  of  this  is  in  the  ballpark,  I do  thinkit  may imply that  we  have more  flexibility  for positive  kinds  ofreasons  than we have had since  I have  been  involved in  this wholebusiness.  We  do  have  some  flexibility to  move  responsibly if  thereshould be  a desire  to  do  so.  I'll  stop  right  there.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  I think  the preparation  for  thismeeting has  been  for me  the most  difficult  of  my tenure,  and that  isbecause we  are  seeing so  many conflicting  economic signals.  We  seemto  be at  the  classic  fork  in  the  road--whether or not  this  inventorycorrection will  work  itself  into a downward spiral  or will  turn out  tobe an air pocket  as  we  approach a soft  landing.  There  has  been a fairamount of  discussion today  about  the  conflicting  real  economic datasignals.  We  have  talked about  auto  sales,  housing,  the  inventorybuildup,  and the  consumer  sector--these are  areas  where the  signalsare mixed.  But  if  the  real  data signals  are  mixed, I would  have  topoint  out  that  the  monetary aggregates  are  giving  us  even  lessconsistent  signals.  The current  frenzy of  economic  analysis andspinning  of  the  econometric  forecasting models probably  are more thancan be  supported by  the meager  data  to  date.  We are  all  struggling tolook  inside  the  models,  questioning assumptions,  questioning  this,  andquestioning that.  However, because we  are  on such  a narrow path  andthe  adjustment  is likely to  be  so  fine,  it  is  difficult  for the  modelsto pick up  some  of  these  fine  gradations.Well,  having  been  a bit  frustrated by  that  process,  like BobForrestal  I went back to  the  question of  whether some  of  thefundamental  strengths  that  propelled the  economy  forward  in  1994  werestill present.  They are not  as  strong they were,  but  they are  stilldefinitely present.  Business  investment,  while not  growing  at  a highdouble-digit  rate,  is  still  relatively strong.  The  financial  marketsare not pointing  to  an economic  downturn.  The banking  system isstrong.  There  is  no credit  crunch in  sight.  In  the  labor market,even  if  unemployment  does  notch up  a bit,  we are  still  relativelyclose to  full  employment.  In the  manufacturing and  financial  sectors,the  productivity improvements  are holding up.  On  the  inflation front,the  uptick that we  have  seen  this year does  appear  to  be related  tocyclical pressures,  as  Mike  Kelley observed.  Since wage  inflationappears  to  be  in check,  it  is  unlikely that  the  upward adjustment  that7/5-6/95-31-we have  seen  in  1995  is  going  to  be permanent.  On  balance,  thefundamental  strengths  that  brought  us  to  where  we are  now in  thiscycle  remain, but  I think  the  economy  is  vulnerable  to  the  inventorycorrection  that  is  under way.  And as  Bill  McDonough and othersmentioned, there  is  a potential  risk  from  international  weakness  orother  shocks.  When  the  economy  is  in  a weakened  situation,  any kindof  shock  can have more  of  an  impact.  In  short, while  I think thefundamental  strengths  remain,  I think  the  downside  risks  are  stronger.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  During the  last  six weeks  my optimism hasdiminished that  the  inventory adjustment  process  is  going  to  be behindus  after  two  quarters  and  that  thereafter  the  economy will  return totrend growth with unemployment  in  the vicinity of  the NAIRU.  Theinflation  outlook, however, has  correspondingly improved.  Althoughthe  most recent  employment  report  was  a wake-up  call,  I think the  newssince our last  meeting has  been predominantly negative.  GovernorBlinder's prescient prediction  at  our  last meeting  that  the  Greenbookforecast  for  the  second and third quarters  of  1995  would once  again bewritten  down by an  average  of  1/2  percentage point  per quarter  hasproven accurate, although  he,  too,  underestimated the  downwardrevision.  Even so,  I still  consider  the  Greenbook's  forecast a bitoptimistic because  I think the bulk  of  the  risk with respect  to  realactivity is  on  the  down  side.  With  even  a modest  further shortfall  infinal  demand growth,  it  is  easy  to  elaborate  a scenario  in which  theinventory adjustment process  is  more protracted than previouslyforeseen,  and  the  longer-term  outlook, once  inventory factors haveturned  to  neutral,  entails  higher unemployment  and a larger  output  gapthan  the  Greenbook envisions.  We  could easily  end up  I think in  anextended  growth recession.At  our last meeting,  I was  somewhat  sympathetic  to  theGreenbook's  conclusion  that  the  bond market rally might  be  overdone,and  I was  a bit  concerned about  the upside  risk  that  interest-sensitive  sectors might  rebound too  strongly.  My concern  on  thisscore has  faded.  I now  see  the  bond  and  stock market  ralliesfunctioning  simply as  automatic  stabilizers  that partially  cushion  thedownside  risks.  I think  the  impetus  of  lower  long-term interest  ratesand wealth effects  that  are working their  way through the  pipelinewill buoy  spending on housing and  related consumer durables  later  in1995  and  in  1996.  That  impetus  is  needed  to  avoid a hard  landing.  Iflonger-term bond yields  were  to  back up, which is  an outcomeanticipated  by the  Greenbook under  the baseline  fed  funds  assumption,the  downside  risks would be greater.Let  me just  briefly enumerate  what  I see  as  the major  sourcesof  downside risk  at  this  stage.  They have  all  been mentioned in  thediscussion  during the  go-around.  The  first  concerns  inventoryinvestment,  which I think could  easily  turn  out  to  be higher  thisquarter  than  the Greenbook  forecast  of  $29  billion  in  real  terms.This  forecast  is  guesswork  since, as  Mike noted, a lot  of  crucialsecond-quarter  data  are missing.  And  if  inventory  investment  ishigher, more  of  the  adjustment  remains  ahead  than the  Greenbookcontemplates.  I mentioned  this  last  time and  I just  want  to  reiterateit  because  it  is  very  important  in my own  thinking.  There  is  alwaysthe  downside  risk that  an inventory adjustment  could trigger  a7/5-6/95snowballing process  of  cumulative  decline  through  the  multiplier-accelerator  process with negative  feedbacks  on  consumption  asdisposable  income  falls  and  on  investment  as  business  expectations  aredisappointed  in  line  with what  Gary Stern  said had happened at  firmsin  some parts  of  his  District.  As  firms  see  their  expectations  forgrowth on  which their  investment plans  are based being  disappointed,that  could trigger  a decline  in  investment.  Governor  Lindsey voicedconcern at  our  last  meeting  that  credit  terms may  stop  easing or  mayeven  tighten  during a process  of  slow growth or  conceivably recessionif  default  rates,  which  are  now showing some  hints  of picking up,  wereto  rise  further.Another  risk concerns  consumption,  which has been  sluggishthis quarter  and could easily rebound  less  strongly toward year-endthan  the  Greenbook assumes,  particularly  if  a backup  in  long ratesputs  downward pressure  on the  stock market.  The  Bluebook'ssimulations  reveal  that  a higher saving  rate poses  serious  risks  tothe  forecast.  With a  1/2  percentage point  increase  in  the  savingrate,  those  simulations  show unemployment  rising  to  6.8 percent  bymid-1996.A  third risk  that  many of  you mentioned and also  concerns mehas  to  do  with  export  growth, which  is  a needed source  of  strength aswe go  forward.  The depreciation  of  the  dollar  has  left American  goodsvery well  priced  in  world markets  but,  like many  of  you,  I amconcerned about  growth prospects in  Canada and  Japan and our  othertrading partners.  Karen  Johnson gave  good reasons  to  believe  thatgrowth will  rebound later  this  year in  the  rest  of  the world as  in  theUnited  States,  and I certainly  hope  that  comes  true.  But  it  does  seemto me  that  most  of  the  risk  is  on  the  down  side  and the  downside  riskhere  is  magnified through multiplier spillovers  across  countries.  Itcomes  through  one  country spending less  and  other countries  seeingtheir  exports  fall  and  their growth  prospects disappointed.And  then,  of  course,  there  is  fiscal policy where  since  ourlast  meeting  I think  the prospects  for  a contractionary fiscal  packagehave  improved considerably.Now, to  offset  those  sources  of weakness,  the Greenbookforecast  relies  on a strong rebound  in  housing demand and associatedspending on  furniture and other durables,  including motor vehicles.But  under  the baseline  fed funds  assumption with  some backup  of  longrates,  I see  a real  risk of  insufficient  revival  in  these  sectors.Moreover, as  the  Bluebook baseline  simulation makes apparent,  and MikePrell  reiterated this,  by 1996  the  tighter  fiscal  scenario aloneclearly points  to  reduction  in  the natural,  equilibrium, or whateveryou want  to  call  it,  Wicksellian real  rate  of  interest consistent  withan  economy operating at potential.  In  the  Bluebook baseline,  the  realfunds  rate must  decline to  2-1/2  percent by 1996  and 2 percent  by 1997to  keep  the  economy  operating at  potential.  So,  I agree with theconclusion  of both  the  Greenbook and  the  Bluebook  that as  we  goforward the  real  funds rate  will  have  to  decline  from its  currentlevel.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I have  five points  to  make.  I tell  you thatbecause  then when  I get  to  point  four  you'll  know I am  almostfinished.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't  you  start  at  five?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  All  right,  I'll  start  with  five.  That wasabout  inflation.  I thought  it  was a good place  to  finish.At  the  last  two  FOMC  meetings  I expressed  two views--Governor Yellen has  scooped me  on  this.  I said  that  I thought  theGreenbook was  a shade  too  optimistic,  and  I said  that  history  tells usthat  forecast  errors  are  serially correlated.  I say  this  not  togloat,  because I am just  as  guilty of  this  as  anybody else.  I wasbelow the  Greenbook both  times,  but  I was  also  too high both  times.  Iam again  a little below  the  Greenbook.  In  none of  those  cases was  thediscrepancy very  large,  although  this  time  I see  that  I have  thedistinction  of  being  just  enough below the  Greenbook to  be outside  theFOMC  range.  But  that  has  to  do with  rounding  to  quarters,  I hope.  Ifnot,  there  is  a stronger message  there!  [Laughter]  I should add,however,  that  since we  have  free  rein  in  these  forecasts  regardingwhat  we assume  about monetary policy,  I did not  make  the  Greenbook'sassumption about  interest  rates,  but  rather  I embedded in my  forecastthe  assumption  that  the  fed  funds  rate  would be  50  to  75  basis  pointslower  by year-end  than it  is  today,  starting  immediately.I have  several  reasons  for  coming  in with  a forecast  that  isbelow  the Greenbook,  and  I am just  going to  mention them very brieflybecause  someone around  the  table  has mentioned each  of  them by now.The  one  I want  to  emphasize  is  that while  it  is  not  unreasonable  tohave  an expectation  of  a fairly smooth  inventory adjustment  the waythe  Greenbook has  it,  there  is  up  to  now  something between scant  andno  evidence that  things  are working out  that  way  so  far--that  is  tosay,  that  inventory accumulation  is  coming  in  substantially  lower  inQ2  than  it  did in  Q1.  The  data on  that  are  very scanty,  and so  theGreenbook may in  fact  turn  out  to  be  right;  I don't  rule  that  out.But  I think  we should keep  in mind  that,  when  it  comes  to  inventoryadjustments,  the bigger  they  come  the  harder they fall.  Second,  forreasons  many people have  mentioned and as  you probably guessed  fromthe  question I raised earlier,  I think  foreign GDP  is  likely to  beweaker than  our forecast,  and so  exports will  be commensuratelyweaker.  Thirdly,  I am worried about  the  consumer, or  really the rightway to  say  it  is  that  I am worried about  the  multiplier-acceleratormechanisms  being more  severe  than those  embodied in  the  Greenbook.  AsI look  at  this  list,  I figure  that  one  of  those  three downside  risksis  bound to  materialize--I don't  know which one--which is  the reasonmy point  estimate  is  lower  than the  Greenbook's.  So,  take  theGreenbook and subtract  any one  of  those  three,  and you get outside  theFOMC  range.Now, more  important  to  me  than  that  is  the  risk  to  theforecast.  I must be  almost  the  18th person--17th, the  Chairman hasn'tspoken yet--to say that  the  risk to  me  looks  lopsided on  the downside.  That  says  to  me  that  I have  this  point  estimate and, as  I lookand think about  the  probability distribution  around what  I guess  isthe mode--don't  ask me how  I come up with a point  estimate,  I thinkit's  the mode--the risks  are  clearly  on  the  down side.  I mentionedthe  risk of  the  inventory adjustment being more  severe  than  the7/5-6/95-34-Greenbook  forecast,  and  I put  that high on my list.  I can  think  of  arisk  on  almost  every component  of  spending.  On  consumption,  I alreadysaid  that  there  is  a serious  concern  that,  with  lower  employment  andreal wages,  falling  income  will  lead  to  weaker  consumer  spending  thanis  in  the  Greenbook.  There  is  also  a risk,  as  somebody said--it wasBob  Parry--that  1993  and  1994  were  unusually buoyant years  forhousehold  spending and we  simply are  not going  to  repeat  that  again.On  business  fixed  investment,  which  has  been holding  up remarkablywell,  I am very worried  about  the  accelerator  taking  hold as  GDPgrowth turns  from positive 5 percent  in  Q4  to  negative.  As  in  theGreenbook  forecast,  falling  capacity utilization  and weaker  sales  aregoing to  bring  falling profits,  which I think  companies have  notreally factored much into  their  thinking as yet.  Lower  sales  implyless need  to  add  to  capacity.  I hope  business  fixed  investment willhold up  in  response  to  that, but  it  is  a downside  risk.  GovernorLindsey mentioned the  downside  risk  on  the  fiscal  side.  I am a littleless  anxious  about  that  than  I was  at  the  time  of  the  previous  FOMCmeeting, but  I don't  rule  it  out at  all.  And we  have alreadymentioned the  foreign  demand risk.  Frankly, none  of  those worries,  asI look  at  them,  is  that  huge.  But  they  are  all  going in  the samedirection.  The  odds  that we  will  dodge  all  those  bullets are  not  verystrong.The  third point  I want  to  make  has  to  do  with  the  relevanceof  the  latest  tea  leaves  to  surface  to  the  top  of  the  cup,  which havebeen  a bit  better than  the  news  of  the  previous  several months.  Ithink the  news  of  the  last  six  to  eight  days  is  better  than  the newsof  the  last  six  to  eight  weeks.  But  I don't  think we  should getcarried away by  that,  just  as we  should  not have  gotten carried awayby  the  news  of  the  last  six  to  eight weeks.  Had we  taken  that  newsliterally, and if  it  was  the  only  information  that we  had, we  shouldall  be  forecasting a deep  recession.  That would have  been  a greatoverinterpretation of  those numbers  as  they  came  in.  All  of  usavoided  that  overinterpretation I am sure.  Similarly, the  mixed bagof  numbers,  including finally  a few bright  spots  in  the  cloud, doesnot  obviate  the  fact  that  we  are in  a cloud.  Mainly, these  reportslook good  in relation  to  the  unremittingly bad news  in  the precedingweeks.  When  I look at  these  numbers,  I don't  look  so  much  at  the  lastsix  to  eight  days  or  even  the  last  six  to  eight  weeks,  but  the lastsix to  eight  months.  If  we  look  at  the  last  six  to  eight  months,  wefind  that retail  sales were up  just  0.4  percent  from November  to  May.That  is  0.4  percent  in nominal  terms  and not  at  an annual  rate.  Ifmonths, and  if  industrial production comes  in  close  to  zero  in  June,that  will  leave  it  barely above  its  December  level.  Householdemployment--again, depending on  the  way  it  comes  in,  if  the  Junereport  is  close  to  market  expectations  for  total  payroll  employment--will  be unchanged from what  it  was  in November.  That  is  not  about  tealeaves;  that  is  about what  the  economy actually has  been doing in  thenear-term past.All  of  this  does  not  spell  a disaster  scenario, but it  isnegative news  relative  to  what  we  thought  six months  ago.  And itdoes,  as  many people have  remarked,  leave us  with an  economy  that  ishighly vulnerable to  an adverse  shock.  This  is  my fourth point.  Youcould think of  a whole  variety  of  such  shocks,  and when you  aresitting  that  close  to  the  edge,  it  does not  take  very much.  In linewith that,  I examined--with  some help  from staff  here  and also  at  the7/5-6/95New York  Fed, which  I thank--several  statistical  indicators  ofrecession.  I am not  quite  sure how many  there  were because  some  ofthem were  variants--putting  different  things  on  the  right-hand side  tocome  out  on  the  left-hand  side with  a probability of  recession.  Thereis  a whole  bunch of  these, more  than  I realized.  I have  learned  thatit  is  now a small  cottage  industry.  Almost  all  of  them seem  to  beflashing  a number  in  the  30  to  60  percent range  right  now as  theprobability of  a recession,  which, ironically,  is  almost exactly whatyou would get  if  you  just  did  the  most  naive  thing.  The  old  rule  saysthat  if  the  leading indicators  go  negative  three  times  in a row,  thatpredicts  10  of  the  last  5 recessions.  That  is  to  say, it  gives  youabout  a  50  percent chance  of  a recession.  That  is  what  the  leadingindicators  are  saying  now and what  these  statistical  indicators  alsoare saying.  My personal probability is  actually at  the  lower  ratherthan  the  higher end of  this  range,  more  like  a third  than  60  percent,but  it  is  enough of  a risk  to  leave  me uncomfortable.The  fifth  and last  point,  which  should  have been  the  firstpoint, has  to  do with  inflation.  On the  Greenbook forecast,  andcertainly with  a weaker forecast,  the  risk  of  rising  inflation nowlooks  to  be minimal.  In  the  Greenbook,  the  unemployment  rate  isrising  from just  a tad  below the  natural  rate  to  just  a bit  above  thenatural  rate.  Capacity utilization  is  falling to  and  then below itshistorical  average, which leads  me  to  conclude,  exactly as  the  staffdoes,  that  the pressure  for rising  inflation is  either gone  right  nowor  is  soon  to  be gone  as  the  GDP  gap  changes  sign  from positive  tonegative, if  one signs  it  that  way.  This  is particularly  clear  if  youlook  at  the  long-run Bluebook projection, which shows  inflationfalling  ever  so  slightly for  the  next  several  years.  This  leads  me  tothe  final  point,  and  it  is  echoing  what  Mike Kelley said  a few momentsago.  If  this  inflation  outlook  turns  out  to  be  right--and that  seemsto  be  a reasonable expectation--the peak  rate  of  inflation  in  thiscycle,  because there  are  cycles  as  well  as  trends  in  inflation,  willbe 2-1/2  percentage points below the peak  inflation rate  in  the  lastcycle.  That  is  very  substantial progress.  We  have  been talking  hereabout  individual  inflation  forecasts  that  differ very  little.  Peoplehave  said  that  their  forecasts are  higher  or  lower  than  the  Greenbookforecast by  .2 percentage  point  or  so.  Nobody can  forecast  inflationthat  accurately;  nobody on  earth.  So,  a likely reduction of  2-1/2percentage points  from  the  last  cyclical  peak  is  very significantprogress.  It  suggests,  furthermore,  that  one  more cycle, hopefullynot  starting  imminently  on  the  down  side,  is  going to  bring  inflationalmost  to  zero.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  On that  beneficent note, wehave  come  to  a termination of  today's agenda.  I want  to  remind all  ofthe  FOMC members  of  our  usual  annual  dinner at  the British  Embassy at7:30  p.m.  In the  past we  have been quite  successful  in being  asobscure  as  we are  usually.  But we  need to  be a little  careful becauseI think  there probably is  going to  be  some  awareness  outside  that weare  there,  and  I suspect  that  there  is  going  to  be some  attempt  by thepress  to  approach  some  of  the  people who will be  at  that dinner.  So,if  we  can  create some-constructive  ambiguity,  it  will  not be  a greatloss  to  the  world at  large  and  especially for  ourselves.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With respect  to  your  projections, MikePrell  is  keeping  an  open  book and  corrections  may be  submitted  throughMonday, July  10th.  I would also  like  to  call  on Mike  to  bring us  upto  date  on  the  data  that  just  came  out.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I will  be  very brief.Initial  claims  for  the  week  of  July 1 were  published  this  morning andwere unchanged at  369,000.  You  will  recall  that  two  weeks  ago  theyshowed a spike up  to  396,000;  they came  off  last  week  and wereunchanged  in  the  latest  week.  Insured unemployment  was  up  to  2.7million.  That  has been  trending up recently,  so  the  rise wasn'tparticularly surprising  in  light  of  the  initial  claims.  The  leadingeconomic  indicators  were down  0.2  percent  in May, as  we  and most  otherpeople had anticipated.  The  change  in  the  prior month stood at  minus0.6  percent;  there was  a revision  from minus  0.5  percent  to minus  0.4percent, I believe,  in  the preceding month.  For what  it's  worth, wewere  speculating  that  the  measure  of  the probability of  recession thatwe presented  in  the  Greenbook would be about  54  percent  and, with  therevision  to  the  earlier  month--this  is  a very sensitive measure--it  isnow at  48  percent.  [Laughter]  The  Johnson Redbook came  out  yesterdayafternoon--up 1.4  percent  for  June--and you have  the auto  salesfigures before  you.  As  I indicated yesterday, they were up  slightlyin  June  to  14.9  million units  for  light vehicles,  which  is  in  linewith  the Greenbook  forecast.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  is  the  translation  of  the  Redbookinto  reality?  What  is  your guess  as  to  what  that means?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We  find  it  to  be  terribly unreliable, but  achange  that  large might  be  a signal  that we  can  look  for  a positive  inthe  retail  sales  numbers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Maybe  up  0.1  percent!

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It  is  hard  to  say.  That  is  all  the news--some  ofwhich probably is  not  fit  to  print.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  It  will  be in  five years!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any questions  for Mike?  If  not,  let  usproceed with  the  agenda.  I call  on  Don Kohn  to  bring  us  up  to  date  onthe  long-run ranges  for monetary policy.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Don?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Don,  do  we have  evidence--I  think  there wassome  earlier--that  the  velocity of  M2  is  now back closer  to  zero.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  trend in velocity growth?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Yes.7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  whole  level  of  M2  velocity has  shifted up by,I think, about  15  percent;  M2  is  about  15  percent  lower  than we  wouldhave  thought using  old  standards.  There  is  some  evidence  that  thegrowth  rate  relationships  among M2,  nominal  income,  and  opportunitycosts  have  come  back  roughly on  track  in  the  last  two  years  or  so.  Ifthat  were  the  case  and  if  we  had any  confidence  that  it  would persist,we  might be  able  to  imagine  a situation  in  which  the  growth rate  of  M2demand was back on  track and velocity then would  fluctuate  around itscurrent  level  rather  than around  the  lower  old  level.  That  is  adistinct possibility, but  the point  I was  trying  to  make  in mybriefing  is  that,  given  our uncertainty about  these  relationships,  Ithink  it  is  a little  early  to pronounce M2  velocity back  on track.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  it  looks  stable  for  the  last  two years?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Approximately, yes.  Now, we have had more M2growth  in  the  second quarter--by several  percentage points--than  thismodel  was predicting.  In growth rate  terms,  the  model was  right  onfor  1994.  I think what happened in  the  second quarter  of  this  yearwas  that  M2  was  reacting to  the  decline  in  intermediate-  and long-termrates,  whereas  the model  uses  the  bill  rate  to proxy  for  alternativeinvestments.  So,  it  didn't  capture  those  declines.  Going  forward,whether  this  old  standard model--it  is  now nearly ten years  old--willcapture  the  dynamics will  depend in part,  I think,  on whether  short-and long-term  rates move  together  in  their  traditional  cyclicalrelationship.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I will  phrase this  as  a question, but  it  isreally a statement:  If  in  fact  we are back  to  a more  stablerelationship, wouldn't  a 1 to  5 percent  growth range  for  M2  be a bitlow?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That  would  give you  a midpoint  of  3 percent.  TheCommittee has  looked  at  that  as  providing  some  sort  of  benchmark  forwhat  it  might  expect  from M2  when  reasonable price  stability had beenreached.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That's  the  year  2000!

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  For next  year  the models actually see  growth atthe  upper  end of  that range--perhaps  consistent  with what  you aresaying--in the  4 to  5 percent  area,  approximately.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Let me  remind you again  that  we ran  those  modelsoff  our nominal  GDP  forecast,  which  is  a pretty  low number, and  youwould want  to  make  a mental  adjustment  for your  own  forecasts.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Don, applying  the  same  logic  you described withrespect  to  how the  1 to  5 percent  range was  set  for M2,  do we  haveenough  confidence about M3--its  stability over  time  and itsrelationship  to  M2--to  say,  if  historical  relationships obtained, whata comparable range  for M3  would be?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  No,  I don't  have  enough confidence.  In  the past,M3  growth has  tended to  run  approximately a percentage point  abovethat  of  M2,  so  a 2 to  6 percent  range  for M3  would not  seem  to  be  a7/5-6/95-39-bad alignment.  But  the past  experience applies  to  a period  in  whichdepositories  were  capturing  an  increasing  share  of  credit  extensions.If  your best  guess  were  that  their  share  of  credit  flows  would remainabout  constant,  then perhaps  the M3  range  ought  to  be  about  equal  tothe M2  range,  assuming that  depositories  rely  on  retail  and wholesaledeposits  in  roughly  the  same  proportions.  So,  it  is  hard  to  know.  Itreally depends  on  the  role  depositories  will play  in  the  financialsystem.  To  repeat  the  earlier point,  an  M3  range  of  2 to  6 percent  isroughly consistent  with a range  of  1 to  5 percent  for  M2  in  terms  ofhistorical  relationships.  Whether  it  would be  consistent  goingforward is  a much harder  question.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  In  setting  these M2  ranges,  do we normally  lookfor some  consistency between  the  target  range and  the  Committee'snominal GDP  projections?  We  just  did our nominal  GDP projections  for1996.  Their  full  range is  4-1/2  to  6 percent  and  the central  tendencyis  4-3/4  to  5-1/2  percent;  we were  asked  to prepare  our  individualforecasts  on  the  assumption of  a desirable monetary policy.  So,  if  wetake  those nominal  GDP  forecasts  and  assume that  M2  velocity isconstant, wouldn't  that  suggest  that  5 percent M2  growth would beconsistent with  the  forecasts we  are providing to  the public  andCongress?  And shouldn't  5 percent be  the midpoint  of  the  M2  range?If  it  is  not--and  it  is  not  even under  alternative  II  for  1996--itseems  to  me  that  adopting  the  alternative  II  range,  and certainly thealternative  I range,  communicates  a lower real  growth  target  than  ournominal  GDP  forecasts  imply.  A  growth rate  of  5 percent  for M2  isprobably consistent  with,  say,  1-1/2  or  2 percent  real  GDP  growth.  Ifour M2  target  is  taken as  the middle of  our range,  a 1 to  5 percent  M2range  implies  lower  target  real  growth  than  that.  Even  underalternative  II,  the midpoint  of  the  M2  range  is  4 percent  and  thatcould  entail perhaps  1 or  1-1/2  percent  real  GDP growth  for  1996.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think  you are  right,  Governor Yellen,  becausefor  a number of  years  the  Committee  really has  not  been  taking theseaggregates  seriously as  guides  to  policy,  and as  a result  it  has notbeen  moving the  ranges  around  to  make  them consistent with  itsoutlook.  Part  of  the problem  is  that  it  is  very hard ex ante  to  knowwhat  those  ranges  ought  to  be.  We may now have  a little moreconfidence  about  that,  but  even  relative  to  the  staff's nominal  GDPforecast,  which  is  4-1/2  percent  for  1996,  the  1 to  5 percent  rangefor  M2  is  obviously  low.  And  if  I took  the  Committee's nominal  GDP,which is  higher  than  the  staff  forecast--and  especially if  I assumedthat  interest rates  would have  to  be  lower  to  get  that  nominal GDP--wemight have  a decline  in velocity.  That  is,  we might  need even more M2as  market  rates went  down.  I have not  run  the  exercise, but  I wouldguess  that  we would be  talking about  an M2  projection of  5 percent  oreven  a  little over  5 percent  to be  entirely consistent  with  theCommittee's  nominal  GDP  forecast.  The other  way to work this,  whichis  more or  less what  the  Committee has  done  over  the  last  few years,is  to  say  that we  see  this  range as  something  that  is  out  there  toprovide a benchmark in  the  future,  and we are  not paying muchattention to  this now--and  let  it  go  at  that.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  But we were  asked to  communicate our  goals  for1996  and not  for  2000.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I was  going  to  comment  a bit  on what  GovernorYellen was  saying and  also point  out  that  I think we  are  really on thehorns  of  a dilemma.  Governor Yellen's  point  stands  by itself  in  termsof  the  logical  consistency of  what  the  ranges  ought  to  be  relative tothe  central  tendency  of  our nominal  GDP  forecasts.  But  it  is  hard towould convey to  Congress  in  terms  of  the  way we  have been  reducingthese  ranges  over  the  years  and  the  consistency  of  that  with  thecredibility of  our  inflation  objective.  Given  that  we  don't  yet  havefirm  evidence as  to  whether  these measures have  trended back to  a morereliable long-term  relationship with  other economic  variables,  if  wetake what  might be  the  logical  step  and  increase  these  ranges  tolevels  that theoretically make sense vis-a-vis  the members'  nominalGDP  forecasts, we would be  increasing both ranges  to  a degree  thatmight be  considered inconsistent with  the way that  the  Committee  hasbeen reducing them  over  time.  That  is  the  concern  I would have  onthat.I wanted to  raise  a question on  another  subject,  althoughother people may want  to  jump  in  on  the  current  subject.  The  questionthat  I had has more  to  do  with your  longer-run  trends.  I had sometrouble  sorting  out  the distinction between  the  downward  funds  ratepath that  you talk  about  in  the  Greenbook  as  a function of  the  changein  equilibrium real  rates  of  interest--which  is  part  of  the baselineforecast--and what you mean when you  talk  about  a demand shock  as  aresult  of  fiscal  tightening.  Are we  double  counting  there?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  There  is  a demand shock built  into  the  baseline,which  is  the  fiscal  restraint needed  to  balance  the  budget  by the  year2002.  That  is  already  in  there,  so  you would not add more  fiscalrestraint  on  top  of  that  unless  you  thought  even  greater  fiscalrestraint  would be  forthcoming.  One  could also  imagine a  situation inwhich  the path  of  fiscal  policy is  a little  more  front-loaded  than  thestaff  is  assuming and  therefore  the  restraint  happens  sooner  ratherthan later.  As  Mike noted yesterday,  the  assumptions  for  1995  and1996  on  fiscal policy lie  somewhere between  those  of  the  President  andthe  Republicans.  So,  if  you  thought about  a situation where  theRepublicans  somehow prevailed  on  the  stance of  fiscal  policy,  thatalso would be  a demand shock--at  least  over  the  next  few years.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  But  that  is  not  the  demand  shock that  you hadin mind?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  What  we used was a saving rate  shock,  but  Ibelieve we  noted that  you could  think of  it  also  as  a situation  inwhich we had more  fiscal  restraint  than  we were  expecting.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I just want  to  ask  a very brief question  tofollow up  on what  Governors  Lindsey and Yellen were  pursuing.  If  theM2  demand function works,  what  interest  rate  is  assumed tacitly  in a 3percent M2  growth  forecast?  How much higher  is  it  than  currentinterest rates?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  In  terms  of  a trend interest  rate?7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  No,  in  terms  of  1996.  The  point  was made  thatwhat  we would  like  any  of  these  things  to  be  doing  over  the  longer-term horizon may be  one  question,  and what  we would  like  for  1995  and1996  may be another  question.  I was  trying  to  ask  the  easierquestion--from now until  the  end of  1996.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I'm not  sure  it  is  easier!  Of  course,  the  staffhas  4-1/2  percent  M2  growth  projected  for  1996  with the  interest ratesof  the  Greenbook, and  that  means  a gentle  decline  in  interest  ratestoward the  middle of  1996.  If  I used  the  interest  rates  of  thetighter  scenario--that  is,  the  75  basis  point  increase--that  gets  theprojection for M2  down  to  3-1/2 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The  question is  what  interest rates  would weneed  to  make  the midpoint?  The  staff has M2  growth of  4-1/2  percentin  the  baseline and  5-1/2  percent  in  the  easier alternative.  But aswas pointed  out,  those  are  funny numbers  if  you are  aiming  for  3percent.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It  would require  slightly more  tightening  than  thetighter  forecast.  The  tighter  forecast has  M2  growth  of  3-1/2percent;  to  make the  3 percent  you would need  slightly higher  interestrates,  perhaps  avoiding  the  drop  in  interest  rates  in  the  second halfof  1996  or  you might  have  to  raise  rates  a bit  and keep  them up.  Ithink  the  tighter  scenario  gives  you  a baseline  to  think  about  that.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I would like  to  emphasize  the  point  that  thereare many kinds  of  interest  rate paths  that  one  could  imagine.  If  youmoved rates  down  very sharply  in  the  short  run and they were  toflatten out  or  even come back next  year,  that  might  have  someimplications  for  growth next  year;  in  particular, M2  growth might  notrun appreciably higher  than  our  forecast.  There  are lags  here  and westill  don't  know all  of  the  behavioral  relationships--what wouldhappen  to  mutual  funds  flows  and so  on under  some  of  these  ratescenarios.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I want  to  explore  a little  further Don's  answerto  Governor Yellen.  I think in  the past  the  Committee has  lowered theranges  in  part  because  we thought  that  the  trend velocity  of  M2  hadincreased somewhat.  It  was not  that  we believed that  the  rangesshould be consistent  with 3 percent growth  in nominal  GDP.  The  latterwas  closer  to  5 percent.  I think  the  fair  question  to  ask  is  whetherwe  think the  velocity  trend has  shifted  back to  something  closer tozero,  and  if  we believe  that,  then  I think  it  would be consistent withthe  Committee's  forecast  to  change  the M2  target  range.  So,  I thinkthe  rationale had more  to  do with  our beliefs  about  the  trend  invelocity than  it  did with  our  trying to  establish  a range  consistentwith price  stability  in  the year 2000.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  It  seems  to  me  that we are  still  in  a positionwhere we  don't  have  a great  deal  of  confidence about  the  relationshipbetween  the  growth of  the  aggregates  and  the  growth of  the  economy.7/5-6/95-42-In  the  past,  I think we  have  acted in  a way, as  Cathy  indicated, wherewe have  used the  ranges  to  convey a message,  and  I think we probablyare most  comfortable  in  continuing  to  do  that  at  the present  time.  Wewould be  able  in  my view to  increase, as  Don  explained, the  range  forM3  and still  be  consistent with  our  longer-term  objectives.One  point  I would make,  Don, about  your  comment  to  GovernorYellen is  that  I don't  think  there is  a consistent  basis  for  themembers'  forecasts.  That  needs  to  be kept  in mind.  If  we were  to  goaround the  table,  I think people  would give  different responses  aboutwhat  their  forecasts  assume,  and I am not  sure  that all  make  explicitpolicy assumptions.  There  also  is  a difference  between what  theythink is  going to  happen and what  they  think should happen.  We  arenot  given consistent  statements  about  what we  are  supposed to  assumein doing  this  exercise.  So,  I think we have  to be  a little  carefulabout  what  those  forecasts  in  fact  are.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions  for  Don?  If  not,let  me  just  say something that  I think  is  on  the  table,  and I willstart  off  the  roundtable.  If  we presume  that  the  velocity of  M2  isfinally going  to  return at  some point  to  the  stability experienced  fora very long period  of  time,  all  the  arguments  that are being made withrespect  to  the  ranges  are very appropriate  and  to  the  point.  However,the prospect  that  we  will  take  them  seriously, in  the  sense  that  theirbehavior may alter policy,  is  still  a very  long way down  the  road.  Itjust  does not  seem credible  that  we will  develop  enough  confidence bynext  year,  or maybe  even  in  two years,  to  be  able  to  say that M2  isback  on track  in  a manner  that  will  affect  the  way we  conduct policy.As  a consequence,  were  it  not  for  the  Humphrey-Hawkinslegislation at  this  point, we would not  be  having  this  discussion.  Wewould not  even have  the  aggregates,  so  far  as  I can  judge,  as  asignificant  part of  the Humphrey-Hawkins report.  I am not  saying  thatwe  would not discuss  them;  obviously,  they  are not  an  irrelevantissue.  So,  that  really gets us  down  to  the  question  as  to  what  typeof  signal  we  want  to  put  out  there.  In  a sense,  what  are  we  trying  todo  if  we  make  changes  in  the  ranges?  If  we  don't  make any changes,our  decision will  get  zero publicity;  indeed,  that  is  what  we  foundout  after  our February meeting.  No  one cared;  no one  commented;  myrecollection  of  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  hearings  is  that no  one  raisedthe  issue.  I may be mistaken on  that,  but  if  they did  it  certainlydid not make  an impression on me.If,  as  I hope  and suspect, we may vote  later to  ease policy,superimposing on  that a  signal  that  we are  changing the  ranges  wouldworry me  in  the  sense  that  we could be  conveying more policyimplications  than  I think we want  to  convey.  I am persuaded that  theposition  staked out by Governors  Yellen and  Lindsey is  a perfectlysensible  one,  especially a year  from now  if  I may put  it  that  way.  Iwould doubt  very much  that  it  is  useful  to  make any changes  at  thisstage,  and  I think that  there are  more  downside  than upside risksbecause  we are not  in  fact  using these  ranges  for policy purposes.Unless  I am mistaken,  there  are very  few  of  you around  this  table whowould consider that your views  on policy will  be affected  to  asignificant  extent by whether or  not we move  the  M2  range  today.  Thatis  a view which,  I will  grant  to  everyone,  is  disputable because wegot  to  the  1 to  5 percent  range  to  a large  extent by accident.  We  gotthere because  it  was very embarrassing  to  have higher growth cones7/5-6/95when the  growth  figures  were  falling  through  the  floor,  so  we  decidedto  adjust  and we ended  up at  1 to  5 percent.  That  range  is  not  arational  position;  it  is  an accidental  one,  but  if  we  change  it  wewill  be  giving a signal  which  in  my view would probably be  a mistakeat  this  stage.  President  Boehne.

MR. BOEHNE.  In  my view, Mr.  Chairman,  that  is  both anaccurate  and a sensible  statement.  There  is  a dog  over  in  the  cornerand he  is  asleep and his  name  is  Aggregates  and we  ought  to  let  himsleep  for  another year or  two.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree  that  it  wouldbe  ill-advised  to  change  the M2  range  at  this  stage,  especially inlight  of  the  possibility,  as  you postulated, that we might  easemonetary policy.  You would  spend an hour  and  a half of  your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  explaining  the  changes  in  something that we  don'ttake  seriously.  The risk of  the body politic  thinking,  thanks  to  thepress,  that  the  central  bank had decided to  undertake a majorsoftening  of  monetary policy would be  very high, and I think  it  wouldbe very unwise  to  take  that risk.  So,  I agree  very much that  weshould keep M2  where it  is,  and that  would be  alternative  1 for both1995  and  1996.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I certainly agree with  your recommendationregarding M2,  Mr.  Chairman.  With  respect  to  the  other aggregates,  Iwould favor  alternative  II  for  1995  and  alternative  I for  1996.Having said  that,  let  me make  just  a couple of  additional  comments,  ifyou will  indulge me.  I think,  as  the  discussion  is  showing,  that  weall  acknowledge  that  the monetary targets no  longer serve  much oftheir  original purpose,  at  least  for now or  the  foreseeable  future.Among  other  things,  that  purpose was  to  underline  the  System'scommitment  to  price  stability and  to  serve as  a nominal  anchor  formonetary policy.  I think many  interested parties  outside  the FederalReserve,  including some  key Congressmen,  are well  aware  of  that.  Ofcourse,  the Humphrey-Hawkins  law requires  us  to  set  monetary targets,and we will  have  to  continue doing  so  in  the  foreseeable  future  tocomply with  the  law.  However,  the  current short-term policy situationgives  us  an unusual  opportunity  to  argue  for  some  changes  in  theHumphrey-Hawkins  law that  may put  us  in  a position to  develop  a moreeffective and a more  meaningful  longer-term  strategy for  monetarypolicy.Let me  clarify what  I mean  by opportunity.  As  everybodyknows,  the  recent  fairly sustained deceleration  in  economic growth hasa lot  of  people  calling  for  the  Fed to  ease policy.  A case  cancertainly be made  for  that  today.  I am not  going  to  be  the  one  tomake  it,  but  I am sure  someone will;  and should we not  do  anythingtoday, the  case will become  even  stronger as  we go  forward  if  thesluggishness persists.  I think it  is  fair  to  say,  though,  that  manyof  us would be  concerned that reducing  the  funds  rate  target,  even inthese  circumstances,  could seriously damage  the  credibility of  ourlonger-term and  oft-stated commitment  to  price stability, because  atthis  stage  policy has  no  firm  longer-term nominal  anchor.Consequently, within a short period  of  time--it probably would not7/5-6/95-44-happen  immediately--if  the performance  of  the  economy  does  not  playout  exactly  as  we  anticipate,  a drop  in  the  funds  rate  could produceanother  inflation scare.  If  that  happened,  long-term  interest  rateswould shoot  up  and greatly  complicate policy going  forward.So,  as  I see  it,  we  have  a dilemma.  The  way  out  of  thedilemma  in  my view  is  for  the  Committee  to  develop a new and moremeaningful  longer-term nominal  anchor  for  monetary policy  that wouldtie  down  longer-term  inflation  expectations  and really make  ourcommitment  to price  stability  more  credible  than  it  is  now.  Thatwould free us  to  take more  flexibly  the  short-term policy  actions  thatwe  need  to  take.  Monetary  aggregates may  have played this  anchoringrole  in  the  past, but  clearly they  can't  do  it  now.  Against  thatbackground, Mr. Chairman, I would respectfully urge you  to  try  topoint  this  dilemma out  in your  testimony.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think you have  raised  some veryinteresting points.  May I ask,  if  you are not  going to  use  themonetary aggregates,  will  you just  give  us  20  seconds on what youwould propose?

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I was  going  to  lay out  a strategy  as  brieflyas  I could.  A key point  I want  to  make  is  that  the  current  situationgives  us  an opportunity to  recommend something  in  terms  that  arefairly concrete  rather  than  in  the  abstract.  In  my view, we candevelop  a more  operationally meaningful  longer-term monetary policystrategy.  It  would have  three  components.  First,  as  I said inourselves publicly and  firmly  to  the  price  stability objective putforward  in  the  Neal  amendment--both  its  definition  of  price  stability,whose  language  I think  was negotiated at  the  time,  and alsoimportantly its  5-year longer-term  horizon.  It  is  that  specific  timehorizon  that  I think  would make  it  meaningful.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are you  talking about  a statute  orunilateral  action by  the  Federal  Reserve?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  It  would be preferable  to  have  a statute,  butI think we  can go  a significant  distance  in  the direction  I amrecommending  even without a statutory change.  I am not  recommendingexplicit numerical  targets.  It  seems  to  me  that  it  is  feasible toadopt  something  like  the Neal  language  in  the  context of  the  currentlaw.  I would like  to  emphasize  that  the  5-year  time  horizon wouldrepresent  a difference  from what we  have now.  We  have  said a lotabout  our commitment  to  price  stability, and  if  we had  a specific  timehorizon  for  its  accomplishment,  that would make  us  more  accountableand would make  that  goal  operationally much more  meaningful.  If  weadopted  that, we  should  issue an  accompanying  statement  that  says  thatwe expect  to  continue  to  take  short-term policy actions  that  are  aimedat  stabilizing  the  economy  in  the  short  run.  As  we continue  to  takethose  short-run actions,  we  ought  to  emphasize  that  we would  in  eachcase  evaluate  them  against our  longer-term objectives.Second, if  we were  to  refocus  our  longer-term  strategy thatway, I think  it  would be very helpful  to  revamp our  semi-annualHumphrey-Hawkins reports  in  a way that would conform  to  that.  Underthe  refocused strategy  that  I am proposing, the main purpose  of  thereport would be  to  explain how our policy actions  over  the preceding7/5-6/95-45-six months have  been  consistent with  advancing  us  toward our  longer-term  objective and  also  to  explain  how any short-term  actions  that  wemight  have  taken  to  deal  with short-term economic  conditions  areconsistent with  our  longer-term goals.  If  we were  to  revamp  thereport  in  that  way, I  think we would be  in  a better  position tocommunicate  our policy  to  the public  and  the  Congress  and  that wouldhelp  to  increase  our  credibility.Third,  at  the  operational  level,  if  the  Committee  refocusedits  strategy this  way, we  would need  to  alter in  a conforming way  ourshort-term policy  deliberations and  refocus  them  in  terms  of  theoptions  that  we  consider  for  the  short  run.  This  would mean revampingthe  Bluebook  to  some  extent--especially  its  discussion of  short-termalternatives and  options.  In  some  ways  that  has  already been done.In particular, the  current  attention that we  give  to  the  relationshipbetween  our alternative  short-run actions  on  the  one hand  and thebehavior  of  the  monetary aggregates  on  the  other should be  reduced  andreplaced with more discussion of  the  relationship  between alternativeshort-term policy actions  and  our longer-term  inflation  objectives.Again,  some  of  this  is  already being  done,  as  is  evident  in  thismeeting's  Bluebook, but  I think we  need  to  give  it  more prominence.It  needs  to  be done  at  every meeting, not  just  in  July  and February.Now, I recognize  as  well  as  anyone  that  developing an operationallymeaningful  linkage between  short-term actions  and  longer-terminflation  goals  is  extremely difficult  because  there are  long  lagsbetween the  time we  take  short-term actions  and  the  time  they  have aneffect  on  inflation.  That  is  why the  intermediate monetary targets,when it  was  feasible  to  use  them, were  so  useful.  It  is  a difficultissue,  but  I think  there  are  some  things  we could do.  For  example,the  Bluebook  could routinely assess  the  inflation expectationsembedded in bond  rates  and perhaps  speculate on how alternative  short-run  actions might  affect  those  expectations  going forward.  Again,some  of  that  is  done  already, but  the  effort  could be sharpened andgiven more  emphasis.  We  might also  want  to  experiment  with some  sortof  nominal GDP  feedback rule, not  externally but  internally, as  abenchmark  in  considering short-run policy alternatives.  Clearly, theshort-term  operating  issues  are  tough problems  and someexperimentation  is  needed, but  I think  that  would be appropriate.If  I may end up with one  last  comment,  Mr. Chairman, I feelvery strongly  that we have made  enormous progress  in  the  FederalReserve  System over  the  last  fifteen  years in moving from  a dangeroussituation with very high rates  of  inflation  to  where we  are now.  Wehave  gone a considerable  distance  in  increasing our  credibility asprotectors  of  the  value of  our nation's money,  and that  achievementamong other  things  has helped us  to  foster growth in  employment  andoutput  over  time.  As  I see  it,  the  task now is  to  put  in placeinstitutional  arrangements  that would allow us  to  extend and  solidifythose  gains.  So,  I would vote  for  something  like  that.  I think  thetime  to  do  it  is  now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I want  to  start  off with  a couple  of  commentsrelated  to  what Al  Broaddus was  just  saying.  This  is  the  20thanniversary of  Concurrent  Resolution  133.  That  resolution was  adoptedin  the  aftermath of  the  first  oil  shock as  a device to  put boundarieson  inflation  in  keeping with  the  notion at  that  time that  there was7/5-6/95-46-some  stability in  the  demand  function  for  some measure  of  money  andthat constraining  the  growth  in  that measure would put boundariesaround the  rate  of  inflation.  I think  that  after  twenty years  we havelearned a lot;  we  have unlearned a lot;  and  it  is  time  to  rethink  theunderlying premise  of  Concurrent Resolution  133,  which was  codified  inlegislation  enacted  during  1977  and  1978.  We  are  still  beinghamstrung by  something  that  simply does  not  fit  our objective.  Thatobjective  is  to  give  definition  to  the  dollar  and  to  maintain  that  inthe  minds  of  the  people.  The  Humphrey-Hawkins statute,  as  we  call  it,as  was  true  of  Concurrent  Resolution  133,  does  not  do  that.For about  30  years  the  mean  level  of  M2  velocity was  about1.65,  with  significant  cyclical  movements  around that  mean, but stillit  was  a mean  in which we had some degree  of  confidence.  The  rangeswere related to  historical  experience.  There  is  some very tentativeevidence  that  the mean level has  moved up  to  about  1.9,  but  thatevidence  is  very  tentative;  and  even  if  the  new level  is  true  thereare  still  significant  cyclical  variations around  it.  Right now, withthe  recent  acceleration  that  is  being observed, we basically have  twochoices  of  assumptions  to  make.  Either  the mean  level  has  shifted upand we  are getting  a cyclical  increase  in velocity  and  the  recentgrowth  in  the  aggregates  should be very worrisome, or  we  should expecta substantial  deceleration  in  the  rate  of  change  in M2.  If  someonewants  to  make  the  assumption  that  the  level  of  velocity  is  going  toshift  back down  to  what  it  once was,  then  they have  a bigger problem.As  a device  for  communicating  intentions  to  the  public andCongress,  I think  the  ranges  can be useful  if  properly explained.  Idon't  think  they  are useful  as  a way of  indicating  to  anybody how  theshort-run decisions  about  changing the  funds  rate will  be made.  Ilook at  a lot  of  indicators  of  all  sort  of  things;  I look  at  the  priceof  gold;  I look  at  exchange  rates;  I look  at  yield curves.  I wouldnot want  people  to  think  that  decisions  on changing  the  funds  ratefrom one  meeting  to  the next  are  influenced  by any single measure.  Wewould have what  former Governor Wallich used  to  call  the  Goodhart'slaw problem  if  people  started  to  attach  our actions  to  a singlemeasure.  So,  I agree with  the  Chairman's  initial remarks  thatchanging the  announced ranges  of  M2  in  this  environment,  especially ifwe  also decide  to  take  action  in  the near  term  on  the  funds  rate,could miscommunicate what  we  are doing.  A reduction  in  the  fed fundsrate or  the  discount rate  at  this  point, whether we  like  it  or not,  isgoing  to  be  interpreted as  an easing  in policy.  Whether we  think  itis  a more  stimulative  policy or not  is  something else again, but weknow how  it  will  be  interpreted.  Associating whatever explanation wegive  to  that  short-term action with our  long-run  objectives  is  what  Ithink we  should be doing and we  should not  associate  it  with wheremoney growth  is  relative  to  some announced target  range.  They  servetwo different  objectives.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I agree with where you  are comingfrom.  We have  systematically deemphasized these  ranges  because  theyhave not  been reliable,  and  I think  it  would be presumptuous  at  thisstage  to  conclude  that we know where velocity  is  going  to  be.  And soI would  feel  comfortable  with alternative  I for  the  1995  ranges;  Iwould leave  them where  they  are  for 1996,  although alternative  I,which includes  a higher M3  range,  is  acceptable  to me  for  next year.7/5-6/95

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I had  the  unfortunate pleasure ofhaving my maiden  interview with  the  American Banker  quoting me  assaying  that  I am an M2  kind of  guy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I really  thought  that  was  a smalltypographical  error!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I understand exactly where  you are coming  from,but  I will phrase  it  a little more  cynically.  If  after a year M2growth is  above  the  top  of  the  target  range, you will  suggest  thenthat  we once  again  shift  the  range up  as  we  shifted  it  down becausegrowth was  coming out  near  or below the  bottom of  the  range.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I was  suggesting  that  when  it  is  ourjudgment as  a Committee  that  M2  is  something  that we  should bediscussing and  focusing on with  respect  to  policy, we  really ought  tobe  serious at  that  point  as  to  where we want  to  set  the  M2  range.  Inthat  context  I think  the  types  of  arguments  that you and GovernorYellen are making will  be  the  right  ones.  My own view is  that  itwould be premature  to  reach  that  conclusion.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Given  that  you  are  the  one who will  be up  onthe  Hill  to  testify on  these  issues,  I am willing  to  go  along withyour suggestion.  My preference would be  to  go  back  to  a higher  range.I would go  for  what  I would call  alternative  III  for  1995,  which wouldmean  raising M2,  and  alternative  II  for  1996.  In  fact,  there  is  noalternative  III  listed  in  the  Bluebook.  Even  alternative  II  for  1995has  an  M2  range  of  1 to  5 percent.  I think a 2 to  6 percent  rangewould be better  and that  is  the  range  associated with alternative  IIfor  1996.I remember well  our  embarrassment when M2  growth  fell  belowthe  range.  I am a little  concerned  that we will  have a  similarembarrassment when M2  growth  ends  up above  the  range  and  folks  whomight want  a tighter monetary policy will use  that as  evidence  againstus.  But,  again,  you are  the  man who  has  to  be up  there,  and  so  in  theend  I will  support whatever recommendation you make.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Along the  lines  of  my comments  earlier,  I am  inagreement with not making  any changes  in  M2.  You did not  address M3in your  comments, Mr. Chairman, but  I would be  a little  morecomfortable making  a change, particularly  for  1996,  basically becauseI think that  range  has gotten extraordinarily  low.  The arguments  thestaff makes  that  the changes  in  intermediation trends  probably willaffect M3  over  a longer  course of  time  seem  to  make  sense.  So,  Iwould like  to  cast my vote  for  alternative  II  for  1995  and alternativeI for  1996.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Mr. Chairman, with  regard to  the  aggregates,  Icertainly take your  comments  to heart.  In  light  of  that,  I wouldfavor alternative  II  for  1995  and alternative  I for  1996.  I would notchange the  M2  range.  After  listening  to  Don,  the  explanation  for7/5-6/95-48-changing  the  M3  range  seems  straightforward, and  in  that  sense  I wouldgo  ahead and do  that.  I don't  think  that  would cause  any problemswith your  testimony.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree with  that.  M2  is  the  crucialaggregate.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  With regard to  some of  the  issues  that AlBroaddus raised,  I think his  points are well  taken.  We  ought  to  belooking  at monetary policy as  it  relates  to  inflation.  Myreservations  have  to  do with my  impression  that  a couple  of  his pointsin  some  sense  jump  the  gun.  They have to  do  with two  issues  inparticular.  Don Kohn raised a question  about  the  quantification ofthe benefits  of  price  stability and indicated--or at  least  I took hiscomments  to mean--that  the  evidence was mixed and uncertain.  If  westarted doing present value  calculations, depending on what  estimateswe believed, we  might  find significant  benefits or we might  find  thatthe  benefits  are rather  small  relative  to  their cost.  I happen  tobelieve  that  there  are benefits  there  and that  they  are  sizable, but  Ithink it  is  incumbent  upon us  to  make  that  case more  compellingly thanwe have  to  date.  I don't  see  any way around  the  difficult  researchthat probably involves.Another  related and  important  issue  has  to  do with publicsupport  for  any objective  that  we  adopt, whether  it  is  mandated bystatute  or we  do  it  ourselves.  To  some  extent,  it  falls  on us  tobuild the public  support  for  a price  stability objective.  I don'tthink  that  support  is  totally  lacking, but  I don't  believe  there  isany great  conviction among  the public at  large  that price  stabilityought  to  be  the preeminent  objective  of monetary policy.  Until  we  puttogether some  of  that  evidence  I was  referring  to  earlier,  I thinkmoving way out  ahead  and trying  to  bring the  public  with us might  bevery difficult.  So,  for  the  reasons  that  I stated,  I would becautious  at  this  juncture  about  going  down  that path.  I do  thinkthere  are issues  there,  and  I suggested before  that  we  ought  to  bediscussing and looking  at  them and probably finding  some research  todo.  I am concerned about  moving  too  far  too quickly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, I have  a great  deal  of  sympathy  forwhat  President Broaddus  said,  and I think we ought  to give  seriousconsideration to  it.  With regard to  the  upcoming Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony,  I favor  setting monetary targets  that are  likely to  beconsistent with policy goals  in  the  long  run.  The  current  range  forM2  would be  consistent with  low  inflation in  the  long run  if  growth  inM2  velocity returns  to  its  historical  zero  level.  On  the other  hand,if  growth in M3  velocity returns  to  its  historical  average  of  roughlyminus  1 percent,  the  current M3  range would have  to  be  revised upward.Since  there  is  some  evidence that M3  velocity is  reverting  toward itshistorical  norm, I favor  Bluebook alternative  II  for  1995,  which infact  does  raise  the  range  for M3,  and alternative  I for  1996,  whichpreserves those  ranges  into 1996.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I agree with  your concerns  about movingthe M2  range now and how that might  be  interpreted.  I would not7/5-6/95-49-change  that  range.  With  regard to  M3,  I am most  comfortable  with  therationale  that  Bob Parry  just  described with  respect  to  taking a  lookat  long-term trends  and viewing M3  on  a basis  consistent with  what  wehave  been doing with M2  in  recent  years.  That  would  lead me  to  favoralternative  II  for  1995  and alternative  I for  1996.  I would add  thatour  discussion  today points  up  to  me  that  we  are  in  an  increasinglyuntenable position with  respect  to  how we  communicate  to  Congress  ourlong-term intentions  about  monetary policy and  the  need  for  some  sortof  nominal  anchor.  I don't  expect  anything necessarily  to  come  out  ofwhat  Al  has suggested  today, but  I think we  ought  to  have  that  as  animportant  topic  of discussion well  in  advance  of  our  February meetingnext  year.  We might  be  thinking about  the  need to  revise  our approachfor  1996  and perhaps  begin to  move  our  time horizon  further out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We probably will  have  to  respond  to  abill  on  the  Hill at  some point.  Our  response will  have  to  capture  theview of  this  Committee in  its  various  aspects  as  they have  beenraised, largely pro and con, by you, Al  Broaddus,  and the  rest  of  us.It  is  going  to  be our  one  shot  at  the  legislation, and  I am  a littleconcerned  that  if  we don't  focus  on  this  issue, we  could suddenly  findourselves  with significant  mandated revisions  in  what we  do.  Thoserevisions may not  involve  what  we wanted, and  in  retrospect  we mayfind that we  could have gotten  a different  and more  favorable  outcome.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I agree  and  I felt  that  way when we  talked aboutthis  in  February.  The  more  leadership we  exercise in  this,  the  betteroff  we  are  going to  be  in  terms  of  the  ultimate  outcome.  There  aredifferent  points  of  view  on  this  issue,  but  I think  it  would be veryunfortunate  if,  for  example, we  got  to  a year  from now and we weredebating how we might  adjust  the  M2  and  M3  ranges  and never got  tothis  topic.  Price  stability  is  what  a central bank  is  all  about.  Weought  to  be  quite  explicit  about  that  commitment,  and we  ought  todiscuss how we might achieve  it  operationally.  So,  that  is  veryconsistent with  the  sorts  of  topics  that Al  is  raising.  Ultimately, Ithink  it  would  improve  our accountability, which would in  turn  improveour performance  and lead  to  higher  economic  growth  and employment  thanwe otherwise would have  achieved.  Gary Stern made  some  good pointsabout  documenting  that  case.  I think  that  is  becoming  increasinglyurgent,  as  pointed up  by this  discussion today, and  it  is  something wehave  to  pursue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman, your  initial  remarks about  theranges  for  the monetary aggregates  are  quite appropriate and I agreewith  them entirely.  We are confronting  a number  of  issues  in  monetarypolicy at  the moment, and  some  of  those  are going  to  come up  as  theyusually do  in  the  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.  Changing  the rangeswould just draw more  attention to  them  and provide  a real distractionto  the  essential  conversations  that  I think we need  to  be having.With  that  in  mind,  I would favor  alternative  II  for  1995  andalternative  I for  1996.  That  encompasses  M3.Let me  just  add one other  thought,  since  there has been  somediscussion of  possible changes  that Al  Broaddus brought  up.  I willthrow on the  table  the  possibility that  if  we  really do  not believethat  the  aggregates are  going to  return to  providing us  with  somenexus  to  the  real  economy, the  time might be  coming  if  it  is  not  here7/5-6/95-50-already  to  think  about  a change  in  the  statute.  Not  only is  thissetting  of  the  ranges a distraction  for  the  Congress  in  some  sense,but  it  is  occupying  a lot  of  this  Committee's  time  for no  good reasonsexcept,  as  you  said, Mr.  Chairman,  that  the  law is  there.  If  weremove  the  statutory provision, the  focus  of  Committee  discussions  canbe better  directed to  more  important  issues.  I realize  that  there  arerisks  in  going  forward with that  kind of  legislative  request,  but  Ithink  it  is  something  that  we  ought  to  think about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I favor  alternative  II  for  1995  andalternative  I for  1996.  I find myself  quite  frustrated with  thisdiscussion.  I think  part of  it  has  to  do  with  our not  really knowingwhether  the  ranges  are  something we  should be  shooting  for--whetherthey  are  long-term objectives,  or  whether they  are  in  effect  short-term monitoring ranges  to  be explained.  So,  I support  the  notion  ofhaving a more  extended discussion of  what  our goals  should be  in  termsof  thinking  about  restructuring the  Humphrey-Hawkins  statute  and  thekinds  of  things we monitor.  I don't  think  this  is  the  time  to  do  it,because  I am not sure  we know enough now  about  what  range we  shouldmonitor, whether  it  should be M2  or  M3  or  something  else.  At thispoint,  I certainly  agree with  the  notion  that  if  we  change  the  M2range now, we  are  going  to  draw more attention  to  it.  But  at  somepoint  I think we  do need  to  address  the  kinds  of  issues  that AlBroaddus  has  raised and decide whether  or  not we  are going  to  supportlegislative changes  that would get  us  off  the  horns  of  this  dilemma.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  My suspicion,  incidentally, is  that  ifwe  are  confronted  with a legislative  initiative  to  which we have  torespond, that  might  require us  to  have a special  meeting to  discuss  itor  an  addition to  the  agenda  at  a regular meeting  that  extends  thediscussion.  It  is  not going  to  be  easy  to  respond.  However,  if  wehave  specific  language proposed in  draft  legislation, that  will  focuswhere  this  Committee wants  to  come  out  in  the  recommendation  that weas  a group will  want  to  send up  to  the  Hill.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSCOW.  Mr.  Chairman,  I favor  alternative  II  for  1995and alternative  I for  1996.  In  terms  of  the  last point  that we  werejust  discussing, assuming  that  we will  have  to  respond to  some  type  oflegislative  initiative,  I think  it  would be desirable  for us  to  try  toget ahead of  the  curve,  as  you were anticipating  in your earliercomments.  Perhaps  we  could have  staff work done  to  identify someoptions and some  specific  language  that  we could plan  to  consider  at  aspecial meeting  or at  an  extended meeting as  you  suggested.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We have  been doing  that  for  the  lastseveral  years  in part  to  respond to  and capture--not  to  an exactextent but  to  a large  extent--what we  have been hearing around thistable.  However, when  we are  confronted with specific  legislativelanguage we will  have  to  try  to  tie  down  the  issue  and not  just  floatinteresting  ideas across  the  table.  It  is  going  to  become  the  law;the  law  is  going  to  affect  how we behave;  it  is  something  that we  aregoing  to  have  to  deal  with as we  operate  in an  institutional  contexton  a day-by-day basis.7/5-6/95-51-

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I agree  and  the  legislative proposal would bethe  action forcing  the  event.  What  I am suggesting  is  that  inanticipation  of  that  coming  legislation--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree  with  that  and  I think  we willstart  doing that  as  we  begin  to  interact with  the  committees  up  on  theHill.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I was  hoping  that  in  the work  that  will  be  done,we  could see  some  alternative  specific  language.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't  I suggest  this:  Don Kohn  isdoing  a good  deal  of  work on  this  sporadically;  he  is  the  staff'spoint  person on  this  issue.  If  you have  any  ideas  that  you want  toput  forward,  I think  it  would be  very useful  for you  to  communicatethem, hopefully in writing, so  that  we  can all  see  them.  You mightsend  them  to  Don  so  that he  can coordinate  getting  the  various  ideascirculated and we  can  then decide where  to  go  from  there  if  thelegislative  issue arises.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would prefer alternative  I for1996.  In  the  case  of  1995,  I would also prefer  alternative  I becauseI have a problem with  changing benchmarks  in  the middle  of  the  stream.I think we  lose  a lot  when we  do  that  in  terms  of  our  ability todiscuss  and  judge  changes  that  have  occurred  intra-period.  Certainly,we can  conduct policy just  as  well  without  making this  change.  But  Ithink we  can also have  a better and a cleaner  discussion  in  thisCommittee,  in  the press, wherever, without  the  distraction  of  havingmade  a change  right  in  the middle  of  the year  and having people  tryingto  read into  that  something  that was  not meant  to  be  there  in  thefirst place, however  clearly we  may explain  it.  So,  I would prefer  tostay with alternative  I for  1995  and  for  1996  as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Alternative  II  for  1995  and alternative  I for1996  seem okay  to  me.  I would  like  to  associate myself  with  remarksthat  Al  Broaddus  and  Tom Melzer have made.  On  our discussion relatingto  possible  legislation, has  there  been  any further  dialogue withSenator Mack and  is  his proposal  still  the most  likely  that  we willneed to  respond  to?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  seems to  be  the  only  operativeproposal at  the moment.  We  have  been trying  to  persuade  the  Senatorand his  staff  to  take  an approach  similar to  what has been  sort  of  thegeneric  thinking  here.  If  we  have  not circulated a copy of  my letterto  Senator Mack,  I think it  would be quite  useful  to  do  so.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Your  letter has not  been sent yet,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  has  not been  sent?  I thought  itwould be going out.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I wanted  to  talk to  them  about  it  before  sendingthe  letter over.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  A  letter will  be going  out!  [Laughter]I said  in  the  letter  that  I was  not  speaking  for  the  Board or  the  FOMC7/5-6/95but was  expressing my own views  on  certain  issues.  But  I must  saythat  I tried,  as  I formulated  my letter,  to  take  into  consideration anumber of  the views  that  I have heard  around this  table.  I said  thatmy  thinking was still  in  a very preliminary  stage,  but  it  might  beuseful,  when we  get  that  letter  out,  to  circulate  it  to  the  Committee.The  letter  might be  useful  as  a vehicle  to  start  getting yourresponses.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I think  it  would be  important  for  us  to  giveSenator Mack the  impression  that  we are  eager  to  work with him onthis--not  the  impression  that  he  is  dragging us  along  kicking andscreaming.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  and we  are  trying  specifically to  dothat.  Where we  think he has  a view that  would be very difficult  toimplement,  we have been  trying  to  communicate  that  opinion.  Doesanybody else  want  to  comment?  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I would like  to  associate myself with GovernorLindsey's  comments.  I would  favor alternative  III  for  1995  [Laughter]and  alternative  II  for  1996.  I certainly understand the  sentimentsthat you expressed, Mr. Chairman.  This  is  not  the most  importantwith  an  imperfect  law that  asks us  to  communicate  our objectives  in  animperfect way.  I certainly understand why you  don't want  the  rangesto  be  the  focus  of  your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony, and I understandthat  they can be  confusing.  Nevertheless,  at  the end  of  the  day itseems  to  me  that  this  is  the  law  of  the  land and we  ought  to  do  thebest  we  can  to  live with  it  and  to  have  the  forecasts  that we  putforward be  ones  that  are  defensible.  If  you are asked why we  haveselected these  monetary targets,  I hope  you would be prepared toanswer.  Then I ask myself how you would go  about  answering.  If  youwere  to  say that  we  are  assuming a continuing upward  trend in  M2velocity and  if  that  were a defensible  assumption,  that would be  fine.That would  imply,  in  turn, real  objectives  that  I would  find perfectlyappropriate.  But  if  you were pushed  that  far,  as  I imagine  you won'tbe,  and  if  you were  not  prepared to  say  that  an upward  trend  in  M2velocity  is  our  underlying assumption,  then you in  effect  would becommunicating on  behalf  of  this  Committee  objectives which  I would notregard as  my objectives  and  I don't  think they are  the  objectives  ofthis  Committee.  After Bob  Parry  said  that  our nominal GDP  forecastsdon't  represent  our objectives,  I reread the  instructions.  They saidthe  projections for  both 1995  and  1996  should be  based on what  in  ourjudgment would be  an appropriate monetary policy.  So,  I thought  thatwas  the  instruction under which we were  to  be  operating.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't  think it  said money  supply.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  You have  a point.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  It  would be  an appropriate monetary policy--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  However defined.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  --consistent with our projections  for  nominalGDP.7/5-6/95-53-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  There  is  no M2  or  anything elsespecified in  the  instructions.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  But  I think  Bob Parry  said  that  the  nominal  GDPprojections,  or  their  central  tendency,  should not be  interpreted asour  objectives.  Did  I misread  that?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  No, you  didn't.  I get  the  impression  that  peoplehave  at  times  forecast what  is  going  to  happen  as  opposed to  what  theywould  like  to  see  happen.  I could be very wrong  on  that.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  That  is  where  I was  coming  from.  I understandwhy you don't want  this  to  be  a central  issue  of  the  testimony.  Inthe  case  of  1995  we  have  language  for  M3  that  says  that  raising  itsrange  is  a technical  adjustment.  You don't  seem  to  feel  that M3  isgoing  to  be  the  focus  of  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony.  It  seems  tome  that  we could  adjust  up the  range  for M2  for  1996  and make  a verysimilar  statement  about  a change  in  our views about  the  velocity trendfor M2  and say  the  increase  is  a technical  adjustment.  At any rate,that  is  where  I would come  out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I am in  the  Lindsey-Yellen camp  here, but  Imust  say  that  I have  a little  trouble articulating  a view on  the Ms.I find myself  mumbling with great  incoherence  in  the  extreme;  these Msare  a problem.  On your  first point,  I agree  entirely.  These arebasically gibberish  numbers;  we don't  take  them  seriously;  the marketsdon't  take  them seriously;  economists who  pay attention  to  monetarypolicy don't  take  them  seriously;  and  it  is  hard for me  to  get  veryexercised about  them.  Having  said  that,  I think  there  is  someargument  for  consistency with  the nominal  GDP  target,  and I alsowonder why an M3  shift  is  a  technical  adjustment  and an  M2  shift  isnot.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  reason basically  is  that  the M2range  is  wholly an  accident  of  history.  M2  has  become a  crucialvariable  in  discussions  on  the  Hill.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  It  used to  be M1.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  I am just  saying  that  if  you  areasking for  a rational  reason  for  the  current  M2  range,  I can't  findone.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Right,  I don't  think there  is  either, and  it  ishard for  me get  exercised about  this issue  one way or  another.  Now,unlike  the mumbling with great  incoherence,  there were  two  things  thatwere said  around the  table  that  I can relate  to  very strongly.  First,the kind of  plan that  Al  Broaddus  outlined  seems  to  me greatlysuperior  to  these M ranges.  I don't mean that  to  be an endorsementword-for-word;  I don't  think Al  wants  to hold  it  word-for-word.  Butit  surely has  to  be a much better route  than the  M2,  M3  mumblings.  Ijust don't  have  any doubt  about  that.  I think  that  something alongthose  lines ought  to  be explored.  The  other  thing  I can relate  to  iswhat Gary  Stern  said.  Mike  and Don may remember  that  my first  FOMCmeeting was  the Humphrey-Hawkins  one last July, and  I came  out  of  thatmeeting  saying  that we  really ought  to  get  the  staff working  and put7/5-6/95-54-together all  the  research  there  is  on  the  costs  of  inflation  versusthe benefits  of  disinflation;  we  should put  together  some  kind ofcompendium  of  research, which  is  just  what  Gary suggested.  Those  aretwo  very  coherent  thoughts  that  I can  relate  to  on  these  ranges.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Are we returning  to  the  ranges  andthe  vote  on  them?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Even  though we  are required  to  vote  on1995  and  1996  ranges,  let  me  suggest--can we vote  on M2  separately for1995  and  1996?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  As  far  as  I can  judge,  there  seems  to  bea broad willingness,  if  I may use  that  term, to  do  nothing on M2  foreither 1995  or 1996,  but  I sense  that  there  is  a  significant  splitwith respect  to  M3;  there may be  a majority  in  favor of  raising  the  M3range.  I am reasonably certain  about  the  first proposition,  and whatI will  do  is  put  to  a vote  a range  of  1 to  5 percent  for M2  for bothyears,  which  is  unchanged  from  the  current  range.  I would like  to  putthat  to  a vote.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  So  the vote  is  whether people prefer  1 to  5percent  for  M2  for  both years?

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  start  off  the  discussion asusual.  First,  I might  indicate  that  I was  somewhat  surprisedyesterday by  the  degree of  convergence  on  the  outlook.  As  I saw  it,virtually all  of  us  were  concerned about  asymmetric  risks  on the  downside, but  no  one  thought  the probability  of  a recession was  betterthan  50/50.  Indeed,  all  your  forecasts  imply that  the  economy willwork  its way through  this  period.  There was  clearly,  in  thediscussion  and  in  the  evaluations,  some uncertainty as  to  how thecurrent adjustment process ultimately will  unfold.  In  my judgment,the  crucial  issue  is  whether  the  inventory adjustment will  reach  acritical  mass  that  will  weaken  incomes  sufficiently to  upend finaldemand.  Such a development would  in turn  set  in motion  a typicalrecession driven  by inventories  in a vicious circle  downward until  itexhausts  itself.  At  this  stage  that  does not  appear  to  be  the  likelyoutcome, and  indeed time  is  on the  side  of  emerging  stability.  All  wereally need  is  sluggish  final  demand that  persists until  the  inventoryadjustment  finally  dissipates.Three  or  so weeks ago  I must  say  that  I interpreted  the  risksas  still  increasing, because all  the  evidence  that  I could seesuggested that  the  economy was  moving to  the down side.  The  inventoryadjustment process was  under way, but not  as  rapidly as  I thought  wasgoing  to  be needed to  be  easily  successful  in  removing the  adjustment7/5-6/95-56-in  inventories  as  a retarding element  overhanging  the  expansion;  andthere  was  an  increasing danger  that  it  could  reach a critical mass.But  the  data  of  the  last  few weeks  clearly  are  moving  in  the  directionthat,  while  the  downside  risks  are  still  there,  we  at  least  seem tohave  reached  the maximum  risk potential  and  probably are  now  somewhaton  the  other  side.  But  by no  means  have  we  reached  the point  where  wecan very readily presume  that  the  major  threat  to  the  recovery is  overat  this  stage.The  key variable  that  I think  is  crucial  in  this  process  isthat durable goods  tend  to  be  the  major  adjustment vehicle.  Usually,one  can learn  a great  deal  about  that by  looking at  how the  ordersstructure at  the  bottom of  the  durable  goods  pyramid is  behaving--steel,  aluminum, and other  metals  to  a lesser  extent.  An initialevaluation, coming  largely  from contacts  at U.S.  Steel,  was  that  thesteel  industry was  extraordinarily weak.  In  fact,  conditions  in  thatindustry  looked very much  like  those  I have  seen  in  the  past  on  theway  to  a major inventory  liquidation.  It  is  turning  out  not  to  bethat big a problem, because when we  surveyedoperation,  to  get  an idea  of  whether  or not  we are  looking atcompetitive  shifts  or whether we  are  looking at  real  changes,  ourcontacts while  sensing  that  orders  were weak, displayednothing  remotely close  to  some  of  the  negative  vibes we were  gettingfrom Indeed,  the  fact  that  ingot  productionand, as  best  we can  judge,  finished goods  production  are holding upraises  questions  about  how weak  these  markets are,  because  history asI remember  it  for  the  steel  business  tells  us  that  when  the marketsreally start  to  evaporate,  shipments  fall  very dramatically and beforethat  the  ingot  level  goes  down very  sharply.  That  has not  happened.The price  of  steel  scrap has  held up,  apparently bolstered to  anextent by export  demand.  Mill  product prices  seem to  have eased, butit  is  not  terribly clear  by how much.  We  had a significant  decline  inaluminum orders  three or  four weeks  ago.  As  best we  can  judge,  itreflected developments not  dissimilar  to  what  is  going  on  in  steel--the  automobile backup,  excessive  inventories  of  steel  and  aluminum  atservice  centers,  and  to  a small  extent  weak forward orders.  Aluminumorders  have  come  back from  the  low point.  They are  still  lethargicbut  are  scarcely evidencing  the  type of  underlying metals  inventoryliquidation that  usually is  at  the  forefront  of  some  of  the  biggerinventory correction.We  are,  as  best  I can  judge  from  the purchasing managers'data, beginning to  see  some  significant  retrenchment  in  lead  times  ondeliveries.  This  is  probably also  affecting the  holdings  ofinventories  of  component parts  and peripherals  in  the producerdurables area  because  orders  for nondefense  capital  goods weighted bythe  demand  for final  producer durables  are  holding up better  than  thetotal  durable goods  orders  for nondefense  capital  goods.  This  impliesthat  orders  for  peripheral parts  and components  of  the  nondefensecapital  goods  are  coming down, which would be  consistent with the  typeof  durable goods  inventory  correction that we would expect.  We haveseen significant  inventory  liquidation  in both cars  and trucks  in Mayand June.  If  one  looks at  the  data  on  inventories,  the motor vehicleinventory accumulation  in  the. first  quarter was  $14  billion out  of  the$49  billion NIPA inventory  change.  Preliminary data  on motor vehiclesales  and production  for  the  second  quarter suggest  zero  inventorychange,  which effectively means  that most  of  the  implied $20  billion7/5-6/95reduction in  inventory  investment  in  the  Greenbook stems  from themotor  vehicle area  and  is  pretty  much  on  schedule.  The big surge,  orapparent surge,  in  book value  of  manufacturing  inventories  excludingmotor  vehicle  finished goods  inventories  in May  evidently got  markeddown  in  constant dollars  to  a level  which,  combining April  figures,  isa shade--$1  or  $2 billion--under  the  first-quarter  level  for  thatsegment.  Looking  across  the  board,  it  strikes  me  that  the  estimate  ofinventory  investment  in  the  Greenbook  for  the  second quarter  seems  anot  unreasonable number  especially when we  also  look  at  the  shiftsthat  have  occurred  in  C&I  loans  and  commercial paper.  Those  shiftssuggest a fairly pronounced decline  in June  inventory investment  andprobably  in May as  well,  but  it  is  hard  to  say.  While  the  adjustmentin  inventory investment  is  not moving  at  a pace  that  suggests  it  isgoing to  be over  fairly rapidly, it  is  moving at  a pace that  does notseem  inconsistent with the view  that  final  demand will  hold up  enoughfor  it  to  work its  way  through.  I suspect  this  is  the  reason why thegeneral  view around  this  table  has  been one of  mild optimism eventhough  the  members recognize  that  the  downside risks  clearly haveincreased  since  the  last  meeting.So  far  as  final  demand is  concerned, we  saw that  the  motorvehicle  sales  figures were  a shade  stronger in June,  largely  as  aconsequence  of  Chrysler  and the  Chrysler  sales  incentives.  Theimportant  issue  is  probably not  so much  that  sales were up  over Maybut  that  they were up  significantly over  April.told me  that  the market  disappeared  in  thesecond half  of  April.  They didn't  have a clue as  to  why.  The marketcame back  in  early May, and they did not have  clue  as  to  why it  cameback.  It  wasn't  a terribly useful  insight  [Laughter],  but  the  marketdoes  not  seem  to  be  too  bad at  this  point.  The new home  sales  figurefor May, at  an annual  rate  of  722,000,  is  bizarre  as  most  of  thosehome  sales  figures are.  But we  have other  evidence  that  suggests  thatthe  residential  building sector  is  clearly  turning.  As you well  know,mortgage  applications  for purchasing new and  existing homes have  beenmoving up  in  both  the  series  put  together by  the Mortgage BankersAssociation  and  that by Morgan Guaranty, which has a slightly  broadersample.  The  home  builders data  clearly  indicate  that  things  aremoving.  This  is  important  not  only because  of  the  importance  of  theresidential  construction  sector,  but also  because history  suggeststhat motor  vehicle sales  and some  parts  of  the residential  buildingindustry move  together.  If  there  is  firmness  in  the home buildingarea  it  has  to  exert,  if  history is  any guide,  some upward movement  inthe motor vehicle  area, which would be  very useful.With regard to  the  weakness in  the  rest  of  the  world,  I mustsay  that  I subscribe  to  the  concerns  that  the  Vice Chairman and othersamong you have  indicated.  There  is  something going on in  the  rest  ofthe  world that  I find somewhat  disturbirg.  One  gets a sense  that  thepickup  that  seemed to  be under way earl  er  is  having great  difficultygathering strength in  Europe.  In Japan, the  odds  that somethingadverse of  significance  is  going  to  happen seem high enough  to  makeone quite uncomfortable,  and  the  Canadian  economy clearly is  insomething of  a swoon.  Nonetheless,  our  export  orders, probablylargely as  a result  of  the  improved competitive  position of Americanproducers, suggest  that  the  foreign market  is  still moving.The  equipment  markets,  especially when we  adjust  the  ordersfigures  for  the  final  PDE as  distinct  from  all  the  components and7/5-6/95-58-parts,  remain quite  solid.  Unfilled orders  still  seem  to  be rising  ata modest pace,  though  some  slowdown  in  the  rate  of  increase isprobably on  the  horizon as  some around  this  table have  argued, mainlywith respect  to  the  deceleration  risks  that Governor  Blindermentioned.  Although we  are  not  yet  getting  any material  evidence  thatprofits are  weakening,  there  is  some  evidence  that  the  underestimationby the  analysts  of a  continued rise  in  earnings  through  the  firstquarter shifted  in  the  second quarter.  But  it  is  largely  a change  intheir  views  rather  than  any really significant  decline  in  earnings.Indeed,  one  crude measure  that  I tend  to  look  at  because  it  is  usefulon occasion--manufacturing prices over manufacturing unit  labor costsas  a measure  of margins--continued to  move up  through May.  So,  we  arenot  yet  seeing  the underlying earnings deterioration that  one wouldexpect  at  this  stage.  I do  think that  it  has  to  emerge  because  it  ishard to  visualize  that  earnings are  going  to  hold up  through  thesecond and third quarters.  But  at  least  there  is  no  evidence  thatthey are pulling back  to  a degree  that  could undercut  the  capitalgoods  markets,  and certainly the nonresidential building area remainsquite strong.  As  I said before,  it  looks  as  though, or  at  least  thereis  a possibility, that we  are passing  through  and maybe  have passedthrough  the period  of  maximum  risk.  But  just  remember that  businesscycles  are not  smooth even  if  large  external  shocks  are missing.In  summary,  I would say that we  clearly have managed  tocontain  a highly unstable  and  inflationary business  cycle  expansionthat  was  taking on  some  fairly  strong characteristics  in  the  secondhalf  of  last  year.  I think we  have  cut  the  top  off  this  boom andthereby  significantly reduced the  probability of  having to  deal  withwhat  was  going  to  be  a heavy and very distasteful  inventory correctionand perhaps  a capital  goods  correction  late  this  year or  next year.  Idon't  think we  have solved  the  problem of  the business  cycle.  I don'tthink human nature has  changed.  All  we can  hope  for perhaps  is  tolimit  the  degree  of  fluctuation.  But  somewhere,  somehow, by  somemeans,  we  are going  to  get  something that  is  going  to  be called  arecession unless  somebody  finds  that human  nature has  changed  in  amanner  that  it  has  not  in  eons.So  far  as  policy  is  concerned, we  concluded in  late  1993  thatthe  appropriateness  of  a 3 percent  federal  funds  rate was  no  longer  asevident as  it  had been before the  elimination of  the balance  sheetadjustment  strains  and the  50  mile  an hour head winds  to  which  thatrate was  addressed.  We  accordingly and appropriately moved the  rateup as  we confronted new  circumstances in  early  1994.  Today, we havedefused to  a significant  degree the  inflationary pressures  that werebuilding  through the  early weeks of  this year.  At  this  point we  haveto  ask  ourselves whether  a 6 percent  nominal  federal  funds  rate, or  a3 percent  real  federal  funds rate,  is  the appropriate  level we  wish  tobe at  in  the  next  6 to  12  months.In  this regard we have  quite  encouraging evidence  that  thecyclical peak in  inflation may be  close  at  hand.  I think inflation  isbeing held down by events  in  the rest  of  the world.  The  crucialquestion we  must ask ourselves  is  whether we need a 3 percent  realfederal  funds  rate  to  continue  the  secular disinflation  that we  havebeen  involved with  for a number  of  years  and specifically the pointsthat  were made by Governors Kelley and Blinder with  respect  to  thedownward moves  of  the  cyclical peaks  of  inflation.  Remember that  thecyclical peaks  were  all moving up  throughout  the  1970s  and into  the7/5-6/95-59-1980s--indeed, the  cyclical  lows  were  moving up  as  well--and  thesehighs  and  lows  are  now moving down.  If  as  Don  Kohn says,  and  I thinkhe  is  quite  right  in  this  regard,  the  current  real  short-term  federalfunds  rate  is  above  some notion of  the  equilibrium  or natural  rate,and hence  that  rate  is  consistent with  a degree  of  restraint  that  isnot  appropriate  to  the  disinflationary  trend  that  we  envisage  isoccurring,  then the  issue  is  whether we  should bring the  rate  down.If  the  argument  essentially  is  that  the  3 percent  real  rate  is  indeedappropriate  for  the  future,  I would ask how do  we know  that  4 percentreal  or  6 percent  real  is  not more  appropriate?The point  I am  trying to  make  is  that we  are not,  as  aCommittee  with a goal  of  price  stability, saying  that  the  rate  of  realinterest  consistent with  that  is  infinity.  We  obviously are arguingthat  there  is  a certain path which is  consistent  with  that.  We haveto  come  to  a conclusion  of  where  we  think that path  is,  and  this  getsto  the point  that  Al Broaddus was  raising about  how we are  focusing onthe  appropriate  longer-term path  to  price  stability.  As  I read whatit  is  that we  know, the  real  federal  funds  rate  consistent withachieving price  stability is  something under  3 percent--not  forcertain but with  some degree  of  reasonableness.  If  that  is  ourconclusion--and  that  is  what  I would conclude,  though  everyone has  tomake his  or her  own  judgment  on this--the  question  is  what do  we doabout  it.  A month  or  so  ago when a very rapid decline  in  inflationarypressures  seemed  to  be building up,  I would have  been inclined  to  saythat we probably were  safe  in moving the  rate  down 50  basis  points  asa mid-course  correction.  In  retrospect,  I think that  was  a wrong viewbecause  I don't  think  the markets  would believe an  announcement  inwhich we  tried  to  make clear  that  it  was  a mid-course correction andthat  it  was as  far  as  we would go,  which  is  frankly as  far  as  I thinkwe  ought  to  go.  We  tried  to  make  that point  last August going  in  theother direction  and we  failed.  That  is,  the  markets didn't  believe  usand  responded pretty much against  it.I have  concluded  that,  since  the  risks  are beginning  to  easeslightly,  there  is  no urgency here;  but  I do  think we  should movebecause  I find  it  increasingly  difficult  to  argue  in  favor  of  stayingwhere we  are  right  now unless  one  can argue  that  inflationarypressures  are still  building.  I personally find very little,  if  any,evidence  that  that  is  the  case.  I have  concluded that probably  thebest  thing to  do  is  to  move the  funds  rate  downward by 25  basispoints,  which I must  say likely will  be a big deal  because we would bechanging the direction of  policy.  I am  concerned about  going  furtherthan  that  in  part  because  I am really  concerned about  spooking theI don't  think  a larger reduction now is  necessary.  We  could readily,if  we  so  chose,  add another  25  basis points  in August  or  later.  Inthat sense,  I think  what we would do  is  probably create  an expectationin  the marketplace  that  indeed we will  move  again since  everyone says"well, the  Fed never moves only once."  I am not  sure  that  is  all badbecause it  probably would mean that  we would support  graduallycreate  support within the  economic  system.  I find  it  very difficultto  envisage  inflationary pressures emerging at  any point  in  the nearterm.  If  we were  to  lower rates  by 50  basis points,  I am fearful  thewith  that because  it  is  very difficult  to  dissuade  the markets  from7/5-6/95-60-that point  of  view, and  I think we would drive  the  federal  fundsfutures  rate  down  to  a considerable  extent.I come out  with  the  view, which strikes  me as  consistent  withthe  Committee's  basic  economic  outlook,  that  an  appropriate monetarypolicy  at  this  stage  would be  to  move  25  basis  points.  The  choice ofan asymmetric  directive  is  implicit  in  the  notion  that we might  wantto  move again before  the  August  meeting, while  a symmetric  directiveimplies  that we  wouldn't choose  to  move until  that  meeting.  I amstrongly about  that  one way or  the  other.  That  is  because  I thinkevents will  determine what  we will  do.  We  are going  through  a periodwhen we will  know within 6 weeks  or 2 months  at  the  latest  whether  theadjustment  process  that  is  going  on will  cumulate  into  significantrecession pressures  or whether  it  will  end up  as  a pause  in  theexpansion.  I don't  think we  can make  that  judgment  today, but we  willknow a very considerable amount  more  the next  time we meet.  So,  thatis  my view.  Who  wishes to  begin?  President Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman, as  you  have  indicated, inrather robust  economy  in pursuit  of  our  goal  of price  stability.  Ithink no  one on  this  Committee  should  be surprised, and I am sure  noone  is  surprised, that we  have  experienced  some  slowdown  in  theeconomic  expansion.  I guess  the  surprise  for me  and perhaps  forothers has  been the  extent of  the  downturn  that  we have  had.  Now, thequestion  in my mind is  whether  or not  this  slowdown will  result  in  acumulative  downturn and a recession.  My view is  that  that probablywill  not  be the  case and,  as  their  forecasts  indicate,  that view  isshared by the  other members.  If  I were  to  look  at my  forecast andindeed  the  forecast  in  the Greenbook and  the  other  forecasts  that  Ihave  seen,  I probably would not want  to  move  because  I think  theresults  of  those  forecasts  are  reasonably favorable.  Some  of  theforecasts  anticipate  growth  a little below potential but  not  seriouslyso.  The  further question  I ask myself  is  whether  I believe  even myown  forecast.  There  are  enough uncertainties  surrounding  all  theseforecasts  to  make me a  little  cautious  about  the  downside  risks.Those risks  clearly  are  there  although, as  you said,  they probablyhave  dissipated a little  over  the past  couple  of  weeks.  Also,  I thinkthat  the  market  is  telling us  that  the  3 percent  real  federal  fundsrate  that you  talked about  is  a little  on the  high  side.In  terms  of policy  I think  it  is  wise  and prudent  for us  totake  this  action at  this  time--as  an insurance policy in  a sense.When I came  into  the meeting,  I must say  I was  thinking more  in  termsof  a 50  basis point drop  because  I thought  that 25  basis points wouldonly compel  the market  to  keep  asking when the  next  move  is  going  totake place.  But hearing your rationale  for  25  basis points,  I wouldbe prepared  to  support  that.  While 25  basis  points  is  a close callfor  me, I think it  is  highly desirable  for us  to  move at  this  time,whether it  be 25  or  50  basis points.  I think an asymmetric  directiveis  appropriate.  The risks  of  easing at  this point  are  fairly minimalin my view.  The  inflation  rate  is  not  that bad.  As  I have  saidbefore and other people have  said  today, we have  made  substantialprogress,  and I think that we  are going  to  reach  the  cyclical peak ofinflation.  I am not at  all  concerned by  the  argument that  I haveheard outside  of  this  room that  we may have  to move again  on  the  otherside  and  therefore we  should not  move now.  That  argument  does  not7/5-6/95-61-carry much weight  with me  because  I think we  are  compelled  to  movewhen  conditions  so  warrant.  In  summary,  I would support  your  25  basispoint  move  at  this  time  with an  asymmetric  directive.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I strongly  feel  we  should be  easing  today.Indeed,  it  seems  to  me  that  we  are  already  somewhat  behind  the  curve,which is  something we  rightly  feared greatly on the  up  side.  We neverreally did get  behind the  curve  then,  fortunately.  But  I think we noware behind  the  curve.  We  would be  terribly behind  the  curve  I mightadd, and staring into  the mouth  of  a recession,  were  it  not  for whatyou  said  in your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony in  February, Mr.  Chairman.That  statement,  for which I think we should  all  thank you, inconjunction with  the  incoming data  has  created  an interest  rate  easingthat was  not  of  our making.  And  that,  indeed,  is  what  all  of  us  areexpecting is  going  to  support  the  economy in  the  second half  of  1995,which is  the  crucial period  for  this  episode.  That  is  why  I and,  Ithink, most of  us  are  not  looking  for  a recession  later  this  year andinto next  year.I want  to  say for  the  record, Mr. Chairman,  that  I wrotethese  notes  on  the  4th of July, because what  I am going to  say aboutthe  reasons  is  so  similar  to  what you  just  said.  With  that  in  mind, Iam going to  be  extremely brief.  The  case  for  easing now  starts  withthe presumption,  or  the  guesstimate,  that  the  3 percent  real  fundsrate  is  too  high for  the  long  or  intermediate run.  Were  it  not  forthat  belief,  I think we  would have  a much weaker case  for  easing now.But  I certainly  think  that  it  is  true.  I think  it  is  very, verylikely  true with the  current  fiscal  stance, and  just  about as  sure asone  can be with  the  significant  deficit  reduction  that appears  to  bein  train.  So,  I feel pretty  confident  that  a 3 percent  real  fundsrate  is  not  something  that  we want  to  live with  for very  long, oranother way to put  the  same  thing,  that  a 3 percent  real  funds  rate  isrestrictive  at  a time  when we  should not be  restrictive.The  second part  of  the  case  is  exactly what you  said  also--that  calling  this  a 3 percent  real  funds  rate  assumes  that  we havecapped  inflation at  about  3 percent, which is  the way  it  looks  to  me.That  seems  quite  likely as well.  If  so,  bringing down  the  nominalfunds  rate  at  this  point  is  in no  sense  abandoning  the  long-runmovement  toward price  stability.  It  is  capping the  cyclical peak,exactly as  you said.The  third part of  the  argument--again you said  it  andeverybody around the  table  said  it  in  the  go-around--is  that  theeconomy  looks highly vulnerable to  a negative  shock right  now.  As  BobForrestal  just said,  that means  we  ought  to  be  taking out  someinsurance  against  recession.  It  would have  been nice  if  we  had takenthis  insurance  out  some months  ago, but  we didn't have  that  kind  offoresight.  We  ought  to  take  it  out  now.The  final  nail  in  the  coffin  is  something you did notmention, but  something that  I know you believe  as  well.  It  is  that,given what  the markets  have  done,  if  the  Fed does  not  ratify  it  withsome  easing--and it  doesn't  have  to  be  today, but  soon--the bondstock market  to  crack  as  well.  So,  the  very things  that we  are7/5-6/95-62-expecting to  support  the  economy  and prevent a recession willevaporate  right  before  our  eyes,  if  we  don't  act.  Now, having  saidthat,  as  you  know Mr. Chairman,  I  feel  that  a 50  basis  point,symmetric move  would be  better  than  25  basis  points,  asymmetric,  whichin  turn would be  better than  25  basis  points,  symmetric.  Let me  verybriefly give  you  the  reasons why  I think doing  50  basis  points  wouldbe preferable  today.It  starts  with  the belief  that  the  ultimate need  is  going tobe more  than  50  basis  points.  If  you don't  believe  that,  doing  50basis  points  today would not be  a smart  action.  There is  definitelyroom  for  disagreement  on  that.  I feel  that  with  the  fiscalcontraction  in  train, more  than  50  basis points  is  likely to  be  theend  of  this  episode.  That  is  to  say,  at  the  end  of  this  episode  thenominal  funds rate  will  be  below 5-1/2  percent.  If  I didn't  feelthat,  I would not  be  arguing for  50  basis  points  now.The  second part of  the  argument  is,  as  I said before, that  Ithink we are  already behind the  curve and it  is  useful  at  this pointto  give  a signal  to  bolster confidence  that  the  Fed  is  watching andnot  asleep  at  the wheel.In  addition to  that,  doing  25  basis  points will  be read  as  afairly timid  action suggesting a very tentative Federal  Reserve  notquite  sure  about what  should be done.  Now, maybe  that  is  in  factaccurate,  and we  are certainly seeing  a lot  of  newspaper reportssuggesting  that.  But  again,  it  is  not  the  image  that  we  would like  toproject,  if  we  can help  it.  Related  to  that,  I think  that  doing 25basis points  now would create more uncertainty about  our near-termfuture  intentions  than doing  50  basis points.  We will  have  thethat  this  is  the  start  of  another  downward staircase.  I think thereis  more credibility  that  minus  50  now would be a mid-course  correctionor whatever you want  to  call  it--I  would call  it  a temporary restingplace--a movement  that  we  would  be  comfortable  to  sit  with for a whileand  observe developments.Finally, no matter what  we  say,  a downward move of  25  basispoints  is  going  to be  read as  evidence of  a divided Committee  that  avery clever  Chairman was  able  to  hold  together on  an  in-betweencompromise.  That,  again,  is  not  a total  disaster.  The  situation  issomewhat  equivocal  and reasonable people  could have different views.But  I would say  it  is  not  the  image  that we  should want.So,  for  all  these reasons  I think doing  50  basis points  nowwould be better  than 25  basis  points now and 25  basis points  inrecommendation.

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I basically agree with many of  thecomments  that Bob Forrestal  made.  If  I were certain of  our  forecastand that  in  the  Greenbook, I would probably favor  leaving policyunchanged at  present.  However, as  we all  know,  forecasts  are  oftenwrong and  they  often underpredict  the  size of  cyclical swings  in  theeconomy.  Therefore,  I support  a 25  or  a 50  basis  point  cut  in  thefunds rate.  I would have  some preference  for  the  latter with7/5-6/95-63-symmetric  language  as  insurance against  a more prolonged decline  inreal  GDP  than  I think  is  most  likely.  I want  to  emphasize,  however,that we should be prepared  to  reverse  course and  raise  rates  ifcircumstances  change  and growth  looks  as  though  it  will  exceed  thegrowth  rate  of  potential output.  In  fact,  I don't  think we  should  cutrates  now unless  we  are prepared to  raise them  again  fairly  soon,should that  become  necessary.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  In my judgment,  and I expressedsome  of  this  yesterday, the  current  slowing  in  the  expansion will  befollowed by a rebound  of  growth at  a rate  near  the  economy's  long-termpotential.  In  fact,  I think  the  recent  evidence suggests,  and youmentioned this  in your  comments,  that  lower intermediate-  and  long-term  interest rates  have  in  effect  put  a floor  under  the  housing andauto markets.  So,  at  this  time  my principal concern  is  really withthe  long-run  inflation  trend.  Trend CPI  inflation  of  3 percent  orhigher  is  reflected in  the  forecasts,  including the  Greenbookforecast,  and in  long-term  interest  rates.  In my view trend inflationof  3 percent just  isn't good enough.  With  CPI  inflation during thefirst half  of  1995  running  about  3-1/2  percent  at  an  annual  rate  andthe  economy expected to  continue  to  expand at  or near  its  potential,  Idon't believe the  current  economic  outlook warrants  a change in  thestance  of monetary policy.  Easing policy  at  the  first  sign  ofeconomic weakness after  a period of  what  I think we would all  agree  isunsustainable  real growth undermines  our credibility and couldadversely affect  the  bond and  foreign  exchange markets.  In  effect, wewould be  engaging in  short-run  fine-tuning  under  conditions  of  greatuncertainty with respect  to  the  economic  outlook.  Accordingly, mypreference would be  to  maintain the  current  restrictive  policy  toensure  that  the  acceleration  in  inflation  that began  last  year  iscapped and  to  bring trend  inflation to  a level  significantly below 3percent.Now, having said  that,  if  it  is  the  strong  consensus  of  thisgroup that  a 25  basis  point  cut  in  the  funds  rate  is  warranted,  Iwould not dissent  on  that  even  though  that  is  not  what  I would  favor.But  I would say  that  if  we did  that  we  should make  it  clear that  thisaction does not  reflect  a change  in  our commitment  to  reduce  the  trendrate of  inflation.  And, as  Bob Parry suggested, we  should be preparedto  reverse course  and allow  the  funds rate  to  rise  should the  evolvingsituation warrant  it.  Any change  in  the  discount  rate  at  this  time  ora larger  change in  the  funds  rate would  be most  inappropriate  in myview.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Going back  toCommittee that  at  that  time  the unemployment  rate  was  still  above  thenatural rate  and  inflation was  still  coming down.  We made  the  verywise and prudent  decision  to  take  a forward-looking  stance  on monetarypolicy  and not  react  to  current  conditions.  I am  glad we did.  Ithink it  was  the  right  thing  to  do,  and I would suggest  that  we do  thesame  thing today.  When we  look down  the  road  6 to  12  months,  we arelooking  at  the  first  half  of  1996  when our  action will  have  itsimpact.  Therefore,  I agree with  the  point  that was  just made  that  we7/5-6/95-64-cannot  think  of  ourselves  as  reacting  to  the  current  slowdown becausethere  is  nothing we  can do  about  the  current  slowdown.  What we can  dois  affect what  we  think  is  going  to  be  the  economy  in  early 1996.  Inthat  regard, I think  we  are  fortunate  that we  have  had the  slowdown  inthe  second  quarter of  1995.  Had we  had the  slowdown  in  the  fourthquarter  of  1995  or  the  first  quarter  of  1996  when  some  other factorsthat  I foresee  are  going  to  come  into  play, we  would be  in  theproverbial  soup.I think the  Greenbook,  although  I am glad  to  see  they havemade  an assumption  of  fiscal policy contraction,  understates  theactual  amount.  What  they did was  to  average  the  President's proposaland the  Congressional proposal when,  in  fact,  these  proposals  startfrom different baselines.  The Medicare  saving  that  the  Presidentproposed  is  from a rate  of  growth in  Medicare spending  that  is  thesame  as  the  Senate's, and  on  the  appropriations  side  that  is  not  wherethe  differences  really are.  I think we  may see  something a lot  closerto  $40  billion  followed by  another $40  billion  rather  than  the  numbersin  the  Greenbook.  In  addition,  in  the  first  half  of  next  year, wehave to  add to  that  the  potential of  three  other downside  risks.  Inthe  order  of  their  likelihood I would call  them Japan,  Canada, andEurope.  None of  us  can  really bet  on  the  state  of  the  Japaneseeconomy.  The chances  of  something  significant  happening  there areprobably less  than  50/50,  but  they are  high enough when we  add that  tothe probability of  continued sluggishness  in  Canada and/or lessexpansion  than the  Greenbook  forecast  for  Europe;  the  latter  seemshigh  to  me  given  that  they have  to  have both  a fiscal  and a monetarycontraction  to meet  the Maastrich  criteria.  It  all  adds  up  to  a slowfirst  half  of  1996.I agree,  therefore, with Governor Blinder  that  ultimately weare  going  to  need more  than  a 50  basis  point reduction.  If  I werebetting  I would say  that  a year  from now we will  be  100  basis pointsunder where we  are now, and we  still  may be  chasing where  we want  tobe.  However, Mr. Chairman,  I agree  with your  point  on  tacticalgrounds.  I think  that  25  basis  points  is  the  right  move  to  make  todaylargely because  of  those  foreign  exchange rate  considerations.  Iwould be very nervous,  given the  current  state  of  the  yen, aboutmaking a move  that  was  considered bold and  aggressive and might  sendthe  yen up, with  all  kinds  of  perverse implications  for  our bondrecommendation.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I can be brief;  I planned  to  say a lot  about  thedebt  aggregate!  [Laughter]  We probably have  one negative  quarter  inthe  bag and we may have  a second  in  the  bag.  If  we  do,  that  will  beembarrassing.  It  will  be  called a recession;  and if  we  have arecession in  the  second and third quarters,  looking back on  it  in  thefuture, we will  be  a lot  happier if  we had eased  today.  If we barelyescape  a negative  third quarter and barely escape  the  recession  label,the  economy is  still  likely  to  be weak and  an easing will  still  lookto have been  appropriate at  this  time.  Only if  we  have  a boomingthird quarter will  we  look back  on a decision to  cut  the  fed fundstarget now as  something of  an embarrassment.  If  the  economy  lastgone  that  last  50  basis points.  It  now looks  like we may have  gone7/5-6/95-65-one bridge  too  far.  I don't  regard a 25  basis point  reduction in  thefed  funds  target  as  much  of  an  easing of  policy, but  even  if  we callit  an  easing,  it  is  consistent  with our  long-term goal  of  fightinginflation  for much  the  same reason  that  a race  car  has  brakes.  Thepoint  is  not  to  reduce  the  average  speed  of  the  race  car but  to  keepit  on  the  track  for  the  maximum  sustainable  speed.  A  recession now isnot  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Federal  Reserve  in  the  future and  ourfuture will  be  to  fight  inflation.  As  for  tactics  and  the  probablereaction  of  the markets,  I'll  have  to  defer  to  your  judgment.  I mustadmit,  though,  that  coming  into  the meeting my rationale was  that  a 50basis point  reduction would leave  the  markets more  settled than  a 25basis point  reduction.  I think  they are going  to  start  clammering  forthe  next  25  basis points  immediately.  So,  I would have  recommended a50  basis  point move,  but  I will  defer  to  your judgment  on  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  This  is  a fairly difficult policy decision forme.  When  I reviewed  all  the  materials  for  this meeting,  I realizedthat  any decision that  I would make would really depend on  theinterplay of  three different  factors.  The  first  relates  to my ownpreference among  the  three  longer-run policy alternatives  that Donlaid  out,  and I must  confess  to  some preference  for the baselinestrategy among  the  three,  recognizing  that  they are  all  forecast-basedand so  forth.  Second, and probably more  important,  is  my view ofshort-term risks  to  the  baseline  forecast  as  we  see  it  in  theGreenbook.  And  finally, even  if  the  risks  are skewed  to  one  side orthe  other,  what  are  the  costs  of  being wrong?  That  is,  are  the  costsof  being wrong  relatively high even  if  the  risks  are  low?I think I view the  risks  to  the  forecast pretty much the  sameas  everybody else  here  sees  them.  I think  those  risks  have  changedover  the  last  few months  from being  on  the up  side--that  is,  thatgrowth would be  faster  and inflation more of  a problem--to beingfairly evenly balanced;  and now they  seem  to  be much more  on  the  downside--that  is,  in  the  direction of  slower  growth  than  the  forecastsuggests.  However,  I think these  risks  are wholly  in  the  context  of  apause  in economic  growth and not  a recession.  Growth could be  slowerthan  the  baseline  forecast, particularly  in  the  third quarter, giventhe  uncertainties  about  near-term consumer demand,  inventory buildup,auto  sales,  and other  factors  that people mentioned yesterday.  But  Ido  think there  is  a powerful  offset  to  all  of  this  in  the drop ininterest  rates,  the  health of  the  banking  system, and  the health offinancial  markets  in general.  In my view, those  financial  factorswill  pull  the  economy out  in  fine measure by year-end.I continue to  believe  that  even  though  the  risks  of beingwrong on the  up  side are  small--that  is,  having much stronger growthby year-end than  the  Greenbook predicts  right  now--such a developmentwould be pretty costly  in  terms  of  central  bank credibility and  interms  of what might  have  to be  done  in  1996  to rein  in  excessivegrowth should it  materialize.  In  that  regard, I think the  boom/bustscenario  that DRI  plays  out  in  some  of  its  latest  releases--eventhough  it  gives  those results,  as  I do,  a low probability--isinteresting  and  instructive.  Also,  I should note  that  the  data  havebeen pretty mixed, especially recently, and that  recent  data tend  toconfirm my hypothesis  that  financial  market  conditions  will  spurgrowth by year-end.  A  lot more  data will  come  in by the  end of  July.7/5-6/95Normally,  I would not be  sympathetic  to  a wait-and-see  attitude, but  Ireally have  these  concerns  about  what  would happen if  we  are wrong  onthe  up  side by  the  end  of  the  year  and what we  would have  to  do  in1996  to  rein  in  that  excess  demand.  So,  I came  into  the meetingwanting  to  vote  for  a no-change,  although asymmetric, directive.  I amnot  going  to  dissent  over  25  basis points,  but  I did want  to  conveythese beliefs  on  my part.  I can  go  with  your  recommendation,  and Ican  certainly accept  an asymmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think  a quarter-point  drop  in the  funds  rateis  the  right  amount  at  the  right  time,  along with an  asymmetricdirective.  The  current  level  of monetary restraint  has helped  causemore  of  a correction and  associated downside risks  than we preferred.A cautious move  toward less  restraint,  therefore,  would help  shore updemand and lessen downside  risks.  More  importantly,  it  woulddemonstrate  that  the  Fed  is  awake  at  the switch  and wants  to  avoid arecession.  I think we  would be  seen  as  forward-looking both when  theeconomy  is  overheating and when  it  is  underachieving.  As  the  centralbank  our primary contribution to  prosperity over  time  is  pricestability.  Within  the  longer-run  context  of  moving  toward pricestability, however,  there  is  some  room  and indeed an  obligation totake  into account  shorter-run  fluctuations  in  demand.  Now is  one  ofthose  times  to  act promptly.  To wait  is  to  risk having  to  ease moreand faster  later on, with  a greater  probability of  boom/bust  in  1996or  1997.  A  quarter-point drop  in  the  funds  rate  would be  a prudentmagnitude  for  financial markets  as  well.  It  would in my judgmentbalance the  need to  try  to  avoid feeding  another big run-up in  assetvalues versus  the  risk of  setting  off  a major correction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, after  listening  to  the  Committee'sdiscusion yesterday and  today, one  of  the  things  that  strikes me--itfeeds  a little  bit  off  the Bluebook--is  that  if  we  take  the  outcome  inthe baseline  forecast  as  reasonable  and desirable,  then we  might  gowith a no-change policy.  In  our  own Bank's  view and  in  my view thatoutcome  is  reasonable,  and  in  their  comments  around this  table  a lotof  people  said  that  they  found  such an  outlook reasonable.  Thissuggests  to  me  that  the  real  funds  rate may be where  it  should be  atthis  stage.  There  is  no  strong evidence  that  it  is  not.  When we lookat  the  risks,  yes,  there  are  downside risks.  But as  others havepointed out,  the  strong financial  markets,  the  favorable bankingconditions,  and  our own  Bank's projection point  to  upside  inflationrisks,  and that  leaves  me  inclined to  leave policy unchanged.  Thereis  a statement  in  the  Bluebook  to  the  effect  that  if  we want  to  insureagainst  a possible  further  slowdown, we  might want  to  ease.  But  I amconcerned that  that  insurance comes  with its  own  price.  When we votefor monetary stimulus,  we  are also  increasing  the  risk of  furtherinflation.  In addition,  some members want  to  ease  in  anticipation  ofprospective  shocks  that have not  yet materialized.  The  odds  of  suchoccurrences  are unknown and that,  too,  leaves  me  uneasy about movingat  this  time.  So,  I think  it  would be prudent  for us  to  adopt  anasymmetric  directive  and wait  for  information  rather  than  to move  atthis  juncture based on  the  projections  and  the evidence  that we haveabout  the  real  fed funds  rate.7/5-6/95-67-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I think  the  appropriate  criterion  for choosing  astance of  monetary policy  is  whether we  feel  it  is  a move  toward theobjective  of  stabilizing  the  purchasing power  of  the  dollar.  Aninappropriate  criterion would be  either  somebody's  idea  about  what  theimpact  of  fiscal  multipliers  was going  to  be,  assuming we  knew how tomeasure  fiscal  policy appropriately,  or  some  idea about  a cumulativeprocess of  decline  in  the  economy  in  the  absence  of  some  pump-primingto  prop it  up.  I do  know  that  people  outside  the  Fed,  who believe  insome  kind  of  stagnation  thesis  and think  that  the  economy contracts  inthe  absence  of  fiscal  or monetary stimulus,  are going  to  interpret  ouractions differently  than  I would.  But  I still  think that  there  areappropriate  and  inappropriate reasons  for  our  thinking about whether  apolicy adjustment  is  called  for.  In  Don's  characterization  of  ourmove last  February, one  of  his  interpretations was  that  it  is  possiblefor us  to  take  out  some  insurance, and  I think that was  correct.  Theway  I viewed it  at  the  time was  that  if  we  enjoyed  full  credibility ofour commitment  to  stabilize the  value of  the  dollar over  time  and feltthat we would achieve  a stance  of policy that  in  1996  and  1997  wouldmove us  decisively  in  that  direction, then  I would not  have thoughtthat  the  action in  February was  necessary.  That  is  quite differentfrom what  I thought  about our November  1994  action.  In  my view thataction was  an adjustment  that was  necessary to  move us  toward pricestability.  I did not  think  that  the  February action in  a vacuum wouldhave  been necessary.  With  the  advantage of  hindsight,  I think  theprice numbers  and  the  possibility of  our objectives  beingmisinterpreted had we  not  done  that.The way I think about  policy now  is  in  terms  of  how muchinsurance  we need against  future  inflation.  I would not want  to  betaking  out  insurance  against  a contraction  because  I think  the  economytends  to  expand in  the  absence  of  adverse  shocks  or  perverse policy.So,  it  is  a question  of  whether we  should cancel  all  the  insurance  nowand whether  that would be  appropriately interpreted, or  in  thealternative  that  we  have  a growing confidence  that  we  are back ontrack with  regard to  the  future value  of  the  dollar  and  so  we aregoing to  cancel  half  the  insurance now.  We  can live  with  the  "othershoe  to drop"  syndrome if  it  is  interpreted  that  when we have  furtherevidence that everybody agrees  that  we  are moving  toward stabilizingthe  value of  our currency, we will  then  feel  comfortable  in  cancelingthe  other  half  of  the  insurance policy.  At  that  point  I would pause.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, policy  changes  shouldnot be based on  reaction  to present data,  but  rather on  our views ofthe  economy and prices  about  18  months  from now.  I say  that  becauseif  we were dealing  only with  a response  to  recent data  I would want tokeep policy unchanged because  I don't  like  the  price numbers  that wehave  seen  thus  far  this  year.  But based on a view toward  the  future,I do think  that  the  real,federal  funds  rate  is  too high.  It  is  higherthan  it  either  should be  or needs  to  be and thus we  should  ease.  Thequestion therefore becomes when  and how much.  Especially because  ofmy very great  concern  about  possible  shocks  from weakness  abroad,  Ithink  the time  is  now.  From what we know now and not  giving creditfor  fiscal  restraint until  the  appropriations bills  are passed and7/5-6/95-68-signed by the  President,  I believe  that  the  likely total  easingrequirement  is  50  basis points.  I think  a single  50  basis  point movenow would be  very  likely  to  destabilize  financial  markets  and  lead  toa concern  that  we know much more  than we  really do,  or  fear more  thanwe really  should, about  a likely recession.  That would  disturbthat  it  would disturb  the  dollar/yen relationship  and disturb  furtherthe  already weak Japanese  economy  that  is  a source of  great  worry toquite  a number  of  us.  So,  I think the  downside  risks  that many  of  usdiscussed could become downside realities  as  a result  of  a 50  basispoint  move now.But  I think we  also have  another reason to  be concerned  thatour  fears about  downside  risks  could become  downside realities,  andthat  would be  if  leaks  were  to  come  from  this  meeting that wouldreveal  our very considerable  discussion of  downside risks.  We are  ina particularly  delicate period of  the  business  cycle.  We  are  also  ina very delicate period  for  financial  markets,  and I think we  have toshow an unusual  amount  of  discipline and  restraint  about what we haveto  say  for  ourselves.  Ideally, it  would be very nice  if  all  of  uswere  to  maintain a stoic  silence  until  the  Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony when he could lay out  a very balanced presentation  of whatthe  Committee really  thinks.  Therefore,  I support  the  25  basis pointasymmetric proposal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman,  I believe  that we  should beforward-looking  in  setting our  monetary policy.  While  we had  two  orthree  months  of  bad numbers,  there  is  still  a lot  of  uncertainty aboutthe  economy's  underlying strength.  As you mentioned, some  of  the  morerecent  data  that we  have seen  on housing and  orders  for durable goodssuggest  that  the  economy  is  stabilizing  at  a sustainable  level  of  realactivity.  I think  it  is  important  that  we be  careful  not  to  give  theperception that  we  are  tying monetary policy  too  closely  to  thefluctuations  in  short-run output.  That  would damage  the  credibilityof  our  commitment  to  reducing  inflation.  Clearly,  if  inflationarypressures  are moderating, we  should be  prepared to  reduce  the  federalfunds  rate  gradually.  I believe  the  real  federal  funds  rate  should bebelow 3 percent,  especially given  the  fiscal policy assumptions.  Atthis  point  our  forecast has  the  economy slowing  to  a sustainable rateof  growth with some  reduction in inflationary pressures,  though not  asmuch as  the  Greenbook in  1995.  This  is  based on both  the  forecastthat we have  from our model  and my own personal contacts  with peoplein  our District and  elsewhere.  Our  forecast  also  assumes  that  theCommittee  will  be  lowering the  federal  funds  rate by at  least  50  basispoints by  the  end of  1995.  The  timing of  this policy  action wouldhave  little  impact  on  the  economy's performance  this year.  By  ourassessment  the  25  basis  point reduction  in  the  fed  funds  rate  now willhave little  quantitative  impact, but  it  may serve  as  a signal  that weare  indeed  forward-looking.  However,  I think  it  is  important  that  wenot  give  the  impression  that  we are  simply responding  to  short-runfluctuations  in  output.  It  must be  clear that  our action  isconsistent with  the  slowing expansion and moderation in  the  inflationoutlook.  As  others  have  said, I think it  is  important  that  weindicate  that this  is  not  a change  in  our commitment  to  reduceinflation.  So,  I support  the  25  basis point  reduction and anasymmetric  directive.7/5-6/95-69-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I will  make only  a couple  of  points.  I think  thethe  current weakness  in  the  economy  or  even prospective weakness,  atleast  of  the  type  we have  been  talking  about.  In  part  that  is  becauseof  the  well  recognized  lags  in  policy;  there  is  not  much  we can  doabout  the  economy  at  this  point.  In  part  also,  as  people  havecommented, the  reaction that  has  already occurred  in  the  bond andstock markets  and  the  anticipation  that  the  inventory  adjustment willbe  rather  brief  and rather  shallow--those,  of  course,  are  notindependent  events--do not  suggest  to  me  that  a decision  today hingeson the  immediate  outlook.  What  I think  is  important  at  this  junctureis  that  the  markets have  essentially priced  in  an easing  of  policy.We do  not  in my view want  to peg  the  federal  funds  rate  at  anyparticular level.  Interest  rates  typically fluctuate pro-cyclically.If  we  look at  even the  relatively optimistic  path  for  real growth  inthe  Greenbook or  the  model  that  we maintain, we get  ceteris paribus  anumber of  consecutive  quarters  of  below-trend  growth.  That  is  anenvironment  in which I would  expect  interest  rates  to  be declining.It  doesn't  seem  to  me  that  we  should stand  in  the way of  that.  So,  Isupport your  recommendation,  Mr. Chairman.  For what  it  is  worth,though,  I would prefer a  symmetric directive.

MR. BROADDUS.  I am very much where  Tom Melzer is.  If  I werea voting member,  I would support  your recommendation, Mr. Chairman,although I must  say with a considerable  degree of  nervousness.  Thatkind of  nervousness  has been  underscored by Tom Hoenig and  someothers.  There  seems  to  be  a feeling--calling  it  a consensus  may betoo  strong a characterization--that  we  can be  fairly confident  thatinflation has reached  a cyclical  peak.  The probability of  that  iscertainly higher than  I would have  expected a while  back, but  I thinkwe need to  keep  a longer-term perspective here.  It  was  less  than ayear and an half  ago  that  we  ended  an  extended period  of  substantialmonetary ease.  While  the  risk  of  further  inflation  in  this  cycle  issmaller  than  it  was,  I don't  think  it  is  zero  and we  need to  keep  thatin mind.  I think a cautious  approach  involving a quarter-pointreduction  in  the  funds  rate  is  the  appropriate  degree  of  easing now.I would oppose  a half-point  reduction.  One other  comment:  As MikeMoskow and others  have  said,  it  is  important  in  communicating thisaction  to  the public  to make clear  that  it  is  done  in  the  context  of  acontinuing  longer-term  commitment  to  price  stability.  I would verymuch  like  to  see  the  words  "price stability" in  the  announcement  thatwe  will  make  this  afternoon if  we  take  this  action.  I think it  wouldbe  highly desirable  for  you, as  I am  sure you will,  to  emphasize  thatobjective  in your  testimony a couple of  weeks down  the  road.

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman, as  I said yesterday, I think  thatwe have  the  flexibility here  to  move  for positive  and affirmativereasons  as  opposed  to  negative  and defensive  ones.  Based on myreading of  the  likely outlook,  I don't  see us  as  driven primarily bythe  specter of  a collapsing  economy, although  I would certainly concurthat  the downside risks  are  still  there.  Rather,  I see  the  likelihoodof  a moderate and sustainable  noninflationary growth period  ahead of7/5-6/95-70-us  coupled with  a cyclically plateauing  inflation rate  that  is  stillin a secular  downward  trend.  I find  all  of  that  rather  attractive.It  gives  the  Committee  room  to  move within  the  context  of  maintainingits  posture  relative  to  a steady  focus  on attaining price  stability.The positive  reasons  to  move  have  been  articulated around  this  table,and  I won't  try  to  recite all  of  them  again.  I do  think that  25  basispoints  is  plenty for  us  to  move  today.  The major  significance  will  bethe  change  in policy direction  as  opposed  to  the amount  of  the  move,and  I share  the  Vice  Chairman's  concern  about  the  risk  of  roiling  thefinancial markets  in  destabilizing ways.  I believe  that whatever wedo,  25  or  50  basis points,  there  is  going to  be speculation  about  whatcomes next,  either way.  I also  favor  25  basis points  because  it  isnot at  all  clear  to  me what  our  next move may be  or when  it  may come.For  that  reason, Mr.  Chairman,  I also would prefer to  see  a symmetricdirective, although I certainly  can support  asymmetric  if  that  is  theway we are  going to  go.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I also  think that  the baseline projection  isprobably the  most  reasonable, but  I would support  a 25  basis  pointmove  as  insurance  in  the  sense  of  not  being 100  percent  sure  about howour  forecast  of  the  inventory  correction is  going  to  work out.  I mustsay  that  I vacillate on  this  question of  symmetry or asymmetry.  Iguess  I don't have  strong views,  but  I am marginally supportive  ofsymmetry because  I don't  think  that  we would move before Augustwithout  talking  in  any case.  But  I wouldn't vote  against  asymmetrybecause of  my lack  of  conviction  as  to  the  use  of  asymmetric  language.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I support your  recommendation  tolower  the  funds  rate  today.  As  I already emphasized,  I am concernedabout  downside  risks  and  the possibility of  destabilizing feedbacksthat  could weaken  the  economy more  than  the Greenbook  envisions.  Onthe  inflation  side,  I think a funds  rate  cut  is  consistent with  ourlonger-term objective  of  gradually attaining price  stability,  giventhe  greater  slack already  in  evidence  in both product  and  laborfunds  rate  of  the  size we are  envisioning here,  show a decline  ininflationary pressures as  we  go  forward.To me,  one  of  the  major rationales  for  such  a cut,  asGovernor  Blinder and  others have  emphasized, is  that  we need to  cementin  place  the  existing  financial  conditions  that  are already working toprovide  the critical  cushion against  the downside risks.  So,  I wouldlike  to  see  a cut  to  prevent  a further  backup in  long-term interestrates,  namely,  to  ratify  the  expectations  implicit  in  the  currentstructure of  longer-term yields.  I certainly am not  arguing  that weshould be setting monetary policy by following  the  fed  funds  futures,but  I think we  should recognize situations  when  the market  has  gottenthings  right  and act  accordingly.  I see the  reduction  in marketinterest  rates  that  has  occurred since our  last meeting  as  a verynatural  reaction--Gary Stern mentioned  this,  too--to a  softeningeconomic outlook and as  an automatic  stabilizer mechanism thatcushions  the  the  economy when  it  is  buffeted by spending  shocks.  Ourtask at  this  point  is  to  be  careful  to  avoid a pitfall  that  is  wellrecognized in  the  literature  on  monetary policy.  It  is  that  interest7/5-6/95-71-rate  targeting has  the  potential  to  thwart  the  operation  of  thatnatural  adjustment mechanism, thereby  exacerbating  economicvolatility.  So,  I see  a cut  in  the  funds  rate  now as  essentiallygiving  the  green  light  for  this  market mechanism, which  is  alreadyworking,  to  continue  its  work.  I certainly agree  that  the  rationaleis  stronger  for a cut  now.  As  the  Chairman  emphasized,  and  theGreenbook and  Bluebook acknowledge  this,  eventually we have  to  cut  thefunds  rate because  the  equilibrium  real  funds  rate  is  tending  to  fallas  we go  forward.In my view  this  is  a mid-course  correction and it  is  designedto  do  a little  sooner  as  an  insurance policy  what  I would  envision ourhaving  to  do  anyhow in  the not-too-distant  future.  In a sense  we putsome extra  restraint  in place  last  February at  a time when  it  seemedas  though  the momentum in  demand was never going  to  subside.  Thatsituation has  changed dramatically;  it  changed pretty quickly  afterthe  February meeting.  Now I think  of  that  as  extra braking actionthat  is  no  longer needed, and  I see  this  as  a move  to  a more  neutralstance.  I remember  that  Bill  McDonough warned us  at  the  Februarymeeting  that  we needed to  be  forward-looking and that  we would one dayhave  to  make  a pre-emptive  forward-looking move  toward  ease  that wouldcatch the market  off  guard, but nevertheless  we  should have  thecourage  to  behave in  that  forward-looking way even  though  it  would bea surprise.  My only  regret  at  this  stage  is  that  we really are not  asfar  ahead of  the  curve  as  Vice  Chairman McDonough envisioned in  hisremarks  then.  So  a 25  basis point  cut  in  the  funds  rate  is  not  goingto  be a surprise  to  the  market.  In  fact,  for  much of  the past  monththe  odds  of  a 50  basis  point  cut  at  either this  meeting  or  the  nexthave  been close  to  one.What  should we do  today?  I guess  my inclination would be  ifI had my druthers  to  choose  a 50  basis  point move  today because  Ithink  it  is  needed,  if  not  now then in  the  near future,  to  move  to  amore  neutral policy  stance.  In  a way,  it  would be psychologicallystabilizing  for  households  and  firms  to  be  able  to  rest  a bit moresecure  in  the  knowledge  that  the  Federal  Reserve  wants  to  take  actionsto  keep  the  economy growing.  But  I also  recognize  the  argumentsagainst  such  a move  today  that  the  Chairman  and others  among you havearticulated  on  the basis  of  the possible  impact  on  financial markets.So,  I can certainly support  the proposal  for  a 25  basis  point  cuttoday.  I would have  a strong preference  for an asymmetric  directive,although  I don't  mean by  that  a presumption  that  there would be anintermeeting move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  A cut  of  25  basis pointswith  asymmetric  language seems  to  be  the  general  consensus.  Would yougive us  wording on how that  would read?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I am reading  from page  25  in  the  Bluebook:"In  the  implementation of  policy for  the  immediate  future,  theCommittee  seeks  to  decrease  slightly the  existing degree of  pressureon  reserve positions.  In  the  context of  the  Committee's  long-runobjectives  for price  stability and sustainable  economic  growth,  andgiving careful  consideration  to  economic,  financial,  and monetarydevelopments,  somewhat greater  reserve restraint  might or  somewhatlesser reserve restraint would be  acceptable  in the  intermeetingperiod.  The contemplated reserve  conditions  are  expected to  beconsistent  with moderate growth  in M2  and M3  over  coming months."7/5-6/95

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I hate  to  raise  the  "slightly" versus"somewhat"  issue,  but  if  we are  moving  only  25  basis  points,  then weshould make  it  "slightly."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  I think  you  are  right.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let's  go  to  "slightly."

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Contrary to  the  original  plan, we  aregoing  to  have  lunch  here  since  apparently the  air conditioning  isholding up  reasonably well.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Is  there  a press  release?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am  sorry.  The  draft  reads  as  follows:"Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today  that  the  FederalOpen  Market Committee decided  to  decrease  slightly the  degree  ofpressure on reserve positions.As  a result  of  the  monetary tightening  initiated in  early1994,  inflationary pressures have  receded enough  to  accommodate  amodest adjustment  in monetary conditions.Today's  action will  be  reflected  in a 25  basis point  declinein  the  federal  funds  rate  from  about  6 percent  to  about  5-3/4percent."We will  try to  capture  all  sides  of  the  general  discussion atthis  meeting  in  the Humphrey-Hawkins  report.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman,  is  it  possible  to  add one  finalsentence  there  that  says  "This  action is  taken in  the  context  of  ourlonger-term  commitment  to  price  stability"?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I thought  of  doing  that but  I concludedthat  such  an addition would make  the  statement  too  complex.  I thinkthe  issue  is  that  we  are not  responding  to  an  expectation  of  a7/5-6/95-73-recession.  We are  responding to  the  fact  that  we have  succeeded inreducing inflationary  pressures enough  so  that  the  adjustment makessense  for  the  longer  term.  A  reference  to  price  stability  is  implicitin  there.  I originally had that  in  an  earlier draft  and  I decided  itwas  redundant  and we wanted  to  keep  the  announcement  short.  We  willhave  a longer  explanation  in  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  report.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  What  time  does  this  announcement  come  out?

MR. MCTEER.  Is  there  a good  reason  it  can't  be  earlier?

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Don,  why don't you--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We  have  tried to  establish  a regular  time  so  thatpeople, not  knowing  exactly when  it  would come  out,  would not behovering over  the  Telerate machines  and reading  great  amounts  ofmeaning  into  the  timing of  the  release,  how long you argued aboutpolicy, or  whatever.  So,  we  thought it  was better  to  establish aroutine  time  rather  than making  it  1:55  p.m.  after one  meeting  and2:35  p.m.  after  the  next.  That was  the  reason.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't  we adjourn  and go  to  lunch?
