CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would  somebody like  to  move  approval  ofthe minutes  for  the meeting on November  15?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  I recognizePresident Jordan  for  a motion.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I'd like  to  nominate

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody  like  to  second  themotion?approved.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Unless  I hear an  objection,  it'sPeter Fisher has  a number  of  interesting  things  to  discussthis  morning.  Peter.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  [Statement--See Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?  If  not,  shall wego  on  to  Joan Lovett?

[SECTION]

MS. LOVETT.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--SeeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Joan?  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  You mentioned that  the markets were  thinner  atthe  year-end  than they  usually are.  Would you expand on  that?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  It  has been a disappointing  year for  a  lot  ofpeople  in  the  financial  markets.  We have had  some  sense  sinceThanksgiving  that many people are  just  hanging on  in the  hope  ofgetting  through December  31.  If  they have done well  or have managedto  do  all  right,  they want  to  finish  the year  in  that  position.  Ifthey haven't  done well,  they don't want  to  add  to their  losses.  As  aresult,  there has  been  a general  tendency for people  to  try to  takecover.  This  gives  us  a hint  as  to  why we have had  abrupt moves  whensecurities have  come  into  the  market  in clumps,  because people don'tfeel  they necessarily have  the wherewithal  to  take  them  on.  If  theydo buy them,  they have to  re-route  them right  away or hedge  them withsomething  equivalent.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Is  this  causing more discounting  of  the  OrangeCounty paper  than  you might  ordinarily expect  if  they had been sellingthat paper at  another  time  of  year?

[SECTION]

MS. LOVETT.  I think  that  in  the  Orange County  case thereprobably are  several  influences  at  work.  It  was  helpful  that peopleeventually were able  to  get  a handle  on  just what  the  county has.  In12/20/94the  first  day or  so,  people couldn't  get  any information  from OrangeCounty  on  almost  anything,  and I  think  that  is  what  caused the  biggestcases  to  where  they were prior to  the  break of  the  news  or maybe  just5 or  10  basis points  past that,  even with some  of  the  securities beingliquidated.  So  I think the  initial  move  occurred because  of  the  lackof  knowledge of  exactly what was  going on  and what was  going  tohappen.  By the  same  token, markets  are  in  an atmosphere where  thereis  an FOMC  meeting and people  view interest  rates  as being  on  anupward  trend.  If  you  could have picked a  time  for Orange  County  tosell,  maybe  this  would not have been the  time  you would have picked.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Would somebody  like  to move  to  ratifythe  domestic  transactions  of  the Desk  since the  last meeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So  move.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  [Statement--See  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  [Statement--See Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  either  gentleman?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike, you  talked about  the  inflation  forecast  andindicated  that  you made,  in  effect,  an  intercept  adjustment  in  theforecast  to  carry  forward  the  favorable  experience that  we  seem tohave  had  in 1994.  Would you  talk  further  about  why we  have had thatfavorable  experience  and why  it  might continue?  We may be  seeingactual  growth  in  excess  of  potential.  As we  get  closer  to  capacityisn't  there a risk  that we will  have  seen  a delay  in  the  typicalPhillips  curve  relationship?  If  it  were  to  reassert  itself  in  1995,might  inflation  turn  out  to  be  a fair  amount  higher  than you indicatedin  the  forecast?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That  is  a  risk I hinted at  in my remarks  aboutthe  late  1980s  experience.  I think  the key  here  is  to  look back atwhy we projected  the  inflation  that we  did  for  1994.  In essence,  wewere  concerned at  the  beginning of  the year  that  the  pattern ofexpectations we were  seeing,  the very buoyant  attitudes  and  so  on,  andthe  rapid growth at  the  end  of  last  year  were going  to  give us  astronger  price  increase  this  year  than would have been dictated by  ouranalysis  of  where levels  of  resource utilization were.  Looking  backnow, we  see  a pattern  that  seems  reasonably consistent with  ourfundamental view of  the  Phillips  curve  picture.  We  did not  get downto  our point  estimate  of  the  NAIRU until  this  summer.  Under  thecircumstances,  some  further  deceleration was not  implausible.  We alsothink that  perhaps we  underestimated the  cost  effects  in  the medicalcare  area.  We have  had  tremendous deceleration of  the cost  of  medicalbenefits,  and  this has  helped  to  tamp down  the  rate  of  increase  incompensation.  I think  that  has been a  surprise  that was  not  builtinto  our  forecast and now appears possibly  to  have been a broadelement  that was  helping to  bring down  the  inflation  rate  this year.We don't  see  that  contributing as  much going  forward.  We  think  there12/20/94will  still be  some  deceleration, but  it  will probably  taper off  tosome  degree.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Mike,  there have been  a couple  of  threads  in  thediscussion  about  1994:  the Greenbooks  in  the past,  this  one,  andyour  remarks  now.  On  one  side, we have had a  lot  more growth  inoutput  and employment  this  year than we--or  anybody--had beenanticipating and much larger  increases  in  short-term interest  ratesthan had been expected.  In your remarks,  you made  reference  toquestions  about  the  demand damping  effects  of higher  rates.  The otherside  is  the greater underlying  strength of  the  real  economy.  Whichhas  been  the  larger  contributing factor:  that  there  is  something  elsegoing  on  that  has  created more  strength on  the  real  side  than we hadanticipated  or, as  has been  conjectured  in  the press,  that  monetarypolicy  is  less  potent?  To  which of  these would you  subscribe?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't  think one  can  rule  out  the possibilitythat  the  interest  sensitivity  of  the  economy in  the  short  run may beless  than  it  was.  Certainly, we have  felt  all  along that,  without  thedisintermediation  effects  of  Reg Q  ceilings  that  we got  decades  ago,there wasn't  going  to  be  quite  the  abrupt  swing  toward restraint  thatpreviously accompanied  increases  in short-term market  interest  rates.But we  are  still  learning.  Financial markets continue  to  evolve.  Itis  conceivable  that  the  lag  structure  is  different.  I just  don'tthink we have enough  evidence  to  make a  strong  statement in  thatregard.  Part  of  what  has  happened  this  year has  been a  surprise  inthe  growth of  European  economies,  in particular, that  has helped tobuttress  export  demand.  On  the  domestic  side, while  we  cited  a riskrepeatedly through  the year  that  inventory  investment  could bestronger  than we were anticipating because businesses might  becomeconcerned about  the  availability of  supplies,  as  things  turned out,that  seemed  to  be  a much more  dynamic  feature  in  the  economy  than wehad  anticipated.  There  is  a cyclical  dynamic  to  this.  As  inventoryinvestment  and exports  proved strong,  that  raised  aggregate demand  andthat  in  turn reinforced the  desire  for  inventories.  As we  got moreproduction  and more  income,  that  raised  consumption.  So  this  is  aprocess  that  feeds  on  itself  up  to  a point.Going  forward,  it  is  critical,  as  I noted, that  these  levelsof  inventory investment  are unsustainable.  If  the  economy  is  going  toget  back  to  a growth  rate of  no more  than  the  long-run potential  rate,there has  to  be  a drop-off  at  some  point.  The  question  is  when  thatdrop-off  in  inventory investment  will  occur.  We  are  also  banking onthere being a  significant  lagged  effect  of  the  interest rate  increasesthat have  occurred.  It  is  still  early, as  has been discussedrepeatedly here.  As  estimated even  in  our current models,  the  lagsare  long  enough  so  that  we would  only begin  to  get  significant effectsnow and  in  the  early part  of  next  year.  We  are  also building  infurther rate  increases, which will  have  their effect more  in  thelatter part  of  1995  and  into  1996,  but we  think  these rate  increasesin adjustable  rate mortgages  and even  adjustments  in  the  stock market.If  short  rates  rise  as  much as we  have  assumed,  it  will  be more  andmore difficult  for households  to  get  enthusiastic  about  taking  on whatappear  to  be  some  risks  in  the  stock  and bond markets when  they canget  sizable  real  returns without  risk  in  the  short  run.12/20/94

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  There are  a couple  of  things  that  follow  fromyour remarks  in  looking into  the  year ahead and  contrasting it  with1994.  When I started looking at your  Greenbook forecasts  for  1995  and1996,  on  one side  I welcomed  the  continued discipline  that  comes  fromthe  concern about  inflation and  the  overriding  desire  to  contain  it  toachieve  our  longer objectives.  On  the  other  side,  though,  I wasreminded  of  the  feeling that  I have  had in conversing with employeesin  Cleveland  in  the  last  couple  of  months;  they keep  telling me  thatthe  unusually warm weather  that  we have had in  October, November, andunusually cold January, February, and March.  There  is  this  vindictiveweather god out  there  that  catches  up with us.  What  is  it  about  theprocess  you  go  through  in putting  together the  forecast  that says  thatfavorable  surprises  in  output  and employment  in one  period must  bematched with unfavorable  developments  in  a subsequent period  such thatthe  level  of  output  and  employment always  comes  out  approximately thesame  in  any given  forecast horizon?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In  fact,  we didn't  quite  get back to  theunemployment  level  in  our prior forecast.  We  took  the  kinder, gentlerapproach to  some  limited degree here  so  that  by  the  end of  the  period,we  are in  essence back  at  our point  estimate of  the NAIRU  as  itcurrently  stands  rather  than somewhat  above  that.  This means  inessence  that  we don't  see  any  disinflationary pressure  through  1996.We merely stabilize  things.  That  is  the design principle  here.  Whatwe have  attempted to  do  is  give you  a baseline  forecast  that  holdsactivity to  a path  that  at  least  doesn't  let  inflation get  out  ofcontrol  and  tries  to  tell  you whether  that  is  achievable  and how.That  exercise involves  a great deal  of uncertainty, but  that  is  whythe  good news  in  terms  of  output  and  low unemployment  that we  haverecently experienced gets  offset  by bad news  of  slow growth andincreasing  unemployment  later  in  the  forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.  I expected  that  answer.  Let  me  follow upon  it  because  it  raises  a big  concern  about  our February meeting.Some  time  between now and  that  meeting, we have  to  submit projectionsto  you whose  so-called central  tendencies are  to  be  published in  theHumphrey-Hawkins report.  What  I suspected to  be  the  case  andconfirmed when I  looked  it  up  is  that  the numbers  in the  centraltendency  in  February are  almost  the  same, with  only slightdifferences, as  the prior  December Greenbook projections.  The  centraltendencies,  which  of  course  exclude  the  outliers,  tend  to  be a  littlemore  optimistic  than  the Greenbook  on  output,  a  little  lower onunemployment--0.1  percent or  so--and a  little better  on  inflation.But there  is  not much  difference;  essentially,  the  central  tendenciesare  the numbers  in  the prior December's  Greenbook.  If  that  turns  outto  be  what  happens  this  time,  I am concerned about what we  are  goingto  be  announcing publicly.  The Chairman has  to  go beforeCongressional  committees  two  or three weeks  after  the  February meetingand go public  with these  numbers.  The markets  expect  this  Committeeto  take  some  action  in February to  raise  the  funds  rate  again.  Thenthe  Chairman  is  going  to  be  in  the position  of  saying  that  what weexpect  to  happen--actually I have never understood whether  it  is  whatwe want  to  happen or what we predict  is  going  to  happen--is  thatoutput growth  is  going to  drop under  2 percent,  unemployment  is  goingto  rise,  inflation  is  going  to  rise,  and therefore  we will  jack up  thefunds  rate.12/20/94

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't  know if  there  is  anything I can  say!  Itcertainly occurred  to  me  that taking  these numbers  just as  they aremight provide  a somewhat unappealing  forecast  in  the  Humphrey-Hawkinsreport.  But  this  forecast  is  not  so  far  from  the  consensus view amongeconomists  that  a little degree of  optimism, as you suggested,wouldn't put  it  in the  ballpark.  I don't  want to  prescribe whatpeople  should say here.  What we have  forecast  clearly is  a slightuptick in  unemployment between now and  the  end of  next year, a slightuptick in  inflation, and growth  that  is  only modestly below mostpeople's assessment  of  the  long-term trend.  We are  a little  bitlower,  I think, than  the  consensus  forecast  at  this  point  for GDPgrowth.  We are  lower  on  the  inflation  rate than  the  consensusforecast.  I admit  that  these  are  differences, but we  think  they areconsistent.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  If  I could  add just  two points:  One  is--I'm notsure  this  is  helpful--my impression that  the  Administration is  goingthrough much the  same  problem.  If  they  think that  the  NAIRU is  aboutwhat we have  estimated  it  to  be,  they no  longer are  in a position tosay growth will  slow down  to  potential  of  2-1/2 percent  because  inthat  case  they will  have built  in  a permanently higher  inflation andlower unemployment rate.  I'm not  sure how  they will  square  thatcircle.  In  terms of  comparing  the Committee's  forecast with  theAdministration's forecast,  there  may be  some  leeway on  that  score.  Mysecond point  comes  back to your  initial  question on  the  effectivenessof  monetary policy and whether  it may be  reduced.  In  today's  world,of  course, we  tend to  assume  that  one  of  the  channels  of  monetarypolicy is  through the  exchange  rate.  That  is  why we  have modelresults  that  suggest  the  overall  effect may be  the  same as  it  was  15or  20  years  ago,  but  the  channels  have  changed with  the  relaxation ofRegulation Q.  I don't  know whether  you want  to call  it  an  exogenousevent,  or a favorable event,  or an unfavorable  event,  or  somethingunrelated where there has been  a breakdown  in monetary policy.  But,of  course, with  the  dollar having gone down this  year rather thangoing up,  which would have been your ex  ante  assumption, you do  have adifference  that  could either be  attributed  to a stronger  than  expected"economy" in  some  sense  or a short  circuiting of  that channel  in  thisparticular instance.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further  questions?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I'd like  to  ask a question of Mike  that  keysoff  of  where  he  finished with Jerry Jordan.  Yesterday in thebriefing, Governor Yellen asked Mike a question about  the  differencein  the  forecasts attributable  to  the  tightenings  that  are embedded inthe  Greenbook forecast  but not  yet acted upon by the  FOMC.  She  citedsome  numbers generated by the  staff  model.  Mike, you indicated  thatyou didn't  really accept  those  numbers.  I'd  like  to  know--it  isgermane  to  the question that  was  just asked--what would be  theforecast  at  a constant  funds  rate or  the  difference  in the  forecastbetween a constant  funds  rate  path and the  funds  rate  path embedded  inthe  staff  forecast?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The  model  simulation we have done  using aconstant funds  rate has only  slightly more  growth  in 1995  and thenappreciably greater  growth  in  1996.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Right.12/20/94-6-

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  By  the model's  assessment,  that  would add  severaltenths  to  the  inflation rate  in  1996.  So  in  that  sense,  thedifference here  is  one  of  stable  inflation at  slightly over  3 percentversus  an accelerating price picture with the  inflation  rate moving upinto  the mid-3 percent  range  by 1996.  I don't have  a basis  forseriously questioning  this  outlook.  I do  think  there  is  a  risk  in thenear  term that,  if  the  economy behaves anything  like what we  areanticipating  and if  the  fed  funds  rate were  to  remain at  5-1/2percent,  inflation expectations  could mount  in ways  that  wouldn't beanticipated in  the  structure  of  our model.  It  is  manifest  that  themore.  The recent  response  of  the  markets  to  the  tightening actionshows  that  they are rather  sensitive  to  indications  that we  are  goingto  resist  inflationary  tendencies.  The  common  forecast  is  forinflation  to  move up.  I'd say  the  consensus  is  about  3-1/2  percent,looking  at  the  Blue  Chip  forecasts  for  1995.  I think  there would beconsiderable worry--unless  there are  clear  indications  the  economy hasweakened in  the  next couple  of months--if  the  Fed were not  to move  therate  up  significantly.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I wasn't pushing a constant-funds-rate policy;I was  just  asking what  the  effects  of  that policy were, particularlyon  the  real  growth rate  and on  the  inflation  rate.  On  a  fourth-to-fourth  quarter basis,  your  forecast  has  real  GDP  growth deceleratingfrom  4.1 percent  in  1994,  to  1.9  percent  in  1995,  and  then to  1.8percent  in  1996.  If  you  accepted  what was  in  the  the  staff  model  andyou backed out  the  effects  of  the  coming  tightening,  that  1.9  percentand  1.8  percent would change  to  2.1  percent  and 2.5  percent.  Now, tomy way of  thinking  about  the  marginal  effect  of  new policy withrespect  to  timing, wouldn't  you expect  the  inflation  effects  to  bezilch  in 1995,  pretty mild in  1996,  and  in  fact  mostly having animpact  in  1997?  I am  talking  about  additional policy changes,  notabout  the  tightenings we have banked  already.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  inflation mounts  because,  in  thisalternative, we are  running with an  unemployment rate  that  remainsbelow  the NAIRU  out  through  1996  and presumably into  1997,  so  we  aregetting an  accelerating picture.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Sure.  I'm only talking  about  the derivative.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  But  I  think  that  in  the near  term,  taking  intoaccount  exchange  rate  and  import price  effects  and  so  on,  the  modelbegins  to get  additional  inflation  creeping  in within  1995  andbuilding  a bit.  It  is  very gradual  and probably undiscerniblydifferent.  That  again goes  back to  the  comment  I made  earlier.  Itcould creep up  on you, and  sustaining  the  low unemployment  rate,  ashappened  in  the  late  1980s,  eventually does  build up  to  a  significantpickup  in  inflation.  That  is  what  our  forecast has  been designed toavoid.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I was  not  questioning any  of  that;  youmisinterpreted the  question;  it  is  only about  the marginal  effects  ofpolicy.  If  we  have passed through  the NAIRU, which  seems  reasonablylikely,  exactly what you  said ought  to be happening.  But  the  marginaleffect  on  inflation of  policy tightening  from today  forward,  to my wayof  thinking,  ought not  to be  on  this Greenbook page.  That  is  reallythe  question.  Or  do you  agree with  that?12/20/94

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think it  would  show up certainly  in  the  tenthscolumn, but we are  talking  about a matter of a couple  of  tenths  overthe next  year or  year and a half.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It  is  not dramatic.  I would caution  that  inthinking about  the  slowdown  in  the  economy,  one  does  not want  to  thinkof  that  as  purely a  straight  interest  rate  effect.  Some  of  it  is  theinevitable  reversal  of  that  cyclical  dynamic  in  the  inventoryinvestment  area  that  I talked  about.  Our  inventory equations,  just  asother  forecasting tools,  don't work all  that  well,  so  it  is  notsomething  I'd want  to  bank on  the model  to  capture.  This  is  a veryimportant  element  in  the  timing  of  the  deceleration as  we  see  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  reminds me of  a discussion  Iremember having  at  the CEA  in  1973  when  everyone was  talking about  thesmall  inflationary effects  that  were  on  the  horizon--0.2  or  0.3percent.  Our models  are  really gross  simplifications  of  the  realworld.  As  I've  indicated before,  simulations  on  reduced-formstructures, which without  appropriate  add-ons  give us  silly  forecasts,should not be employed with a great  degree of  confidence  at  thisstage.  I think  our  capability of  doing  the  type  of  simulation  thatyou  are discussing here  is  really marginal.  We have  to  be  carefulabout  reading  terribly much  into  it.  Just  remember,  it  is  the  sameeconometric  structure  in  the model  that  engendered a  significantslowing  in  the  second  half  of  1994,  which didn't  occur.  Thedifference  is  the  add-ons  and  the underlying  structure  that  we don'tcapture.  I'm not  saying  it  is  not useful  to  discuss  what  thepotential  impacts  and  lags  are;  it  is  just  that  I hope  that  everyoneretains  a  large dose  of  skepticism  in  applying  these  types  ofstructures.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mike,  how much  additional  fed  funds  increase  isbuilt  into your  forecast?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  have  the  funds  rate  moving up  into  the  6-1/2or  7 percent  area by  early next  spring.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further  questions?  Let's  move on  tothe  Committee discussion.  Let me just  say,  incidentally,  that  I'venoticed at  the  last  couple  of  meetings  that  our  discussions  ofeconomic  conditions have  spilled over  into  an  awful  lot  of  policy atthis  point.  I request,  if  you  can possibly do  it,  that  you  stay withan analysis  of  what you  see  and  leave  the  policy prescription  for  thenext  segment,  or we will  be  contaminating our  agenda here  in aninappropriate  way.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  though that  that would beeasier  to do  if  the  Greenbook based  its  projections  on where  policy iscurrently.  What we  have  here is  a Greenbook that  assumes  a  furthertightening,  the  amount  of  which  is  unspecified.  So  that makes  it verydifficult  for us  to--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  it was  specified  in theBluebook.12/20/94

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It  is  specified and you  should have heard throughyour  research director what  the  specific numbers  were.  I apologize  ifthere  was  a slip  in communications.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I must have missed it  when  I read the Greenbook,but  just now you  said a  6-1/2  to  7 percent  funds rate.  Surely,  it  wasone  or  the  other  or  6-3/4.  It  seems  sort  of  vague.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  My point  is  that  we  think the  tightening needs  tobe  significant.  I  think a problem with  specific  numbers  is  that  theyimply a  false  sense  of  precision about what  it will  take.  Yes,  toenter something  into an  econometric  model, we would write  down  6-3/4percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I acknowledge your issue but  stillrequest  that,  if  you possibly  can, you  stay on  this  side  of  the  fence.President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Let me  just  kick  off  the regional  overview.The  First  District  continues  to  expand  at  a moderate pace.  We havehad  a rate  of  job growth  for  the  region as  a whole  that  is  behind thenation.  Our  unemployment numbers  are  about  the same,  and  as usualthere  are all  sorts  of  variations by state, with Massachusetts  stillleading  the  pack and Connecticut  still  bumping  along.  Consumer  andbusiness  confidence  in  the region has  risen  sharply according  to bothrecent  data and an increasing  amount  of  anecdotal  information.  On theother hand, while District bank  lending has  grown  through  the  thirdquarter,  the pace  of  its  growth  is  well behind that  of  the  nation as  awhole.  And  if  you  compare  the districts,  the  First  District  islagging in  all  kinds  of  bank  lending.Job  growth  continues  to  be  concentrated  in  services,especially business  and  health  excluding hospitals.  Manufacturingemployment  continues  to  lag,  but  the  anecdotal  reports  from FirstDistrict  manufacturers  are  generally positive.  Strength  is  fairlybroad-based.  However,  there  continues  to  be  weakness  in  the  defensearea.Most  of  our manufacturing and  retail  contacts  reportincreases  in  input prices,  though  their  comments  often  revolve  aroundthe  same  inputs,  largely paper  and wood products  in  our area.  Theyare  also  starting  to  report  increases  or planned  increases  in  sellingprices.  Larger  organizations, both  retail  and manufacturing,  seem toindicate  that  the  downsizing  is  over.  About half  of  our contactsreport  that  they are  going  to  be hiring  in  the new year.  If  they haveprice  increases  in mind, they probably will  be putting  them  throughabout the  beginning of  the year.  There  are reports  of  wage  increasesin  the range  of  3  to  5 percent.  I think,  however,  that  the high  sideof  this  range probably  reflects  some desire  in companies  that havebeen  through downsizing  to reward  those people who  are  remaining.  Idon't think  that  is  necessarily  reflective  of  a  trend of  continuing  5percent wage  increases.Now  trying  to  stay  on the  right  side  of  this  fence,  withregard to  the  Greenbook, we were more  optimistic generally speakingwhen the  year began.  We  thought  there was  likely  to  be  a  lower  fullemployment  level,  a  little more potential  for  growth,  and certainly noinflationary risk of  any size.  We  saw balanced risks  at  that  time.12/20/94As  the  year has gone  by, we along with  everybody else have beenimpressed by  the  degree  to  which  the  data are  always  stronger  than weexpect.  I see  that  Boston  is  widely  thought  of  as  a dove  on  thesematters,  but even  the most dovish  of  the people  at  the  Boston Fed nowbelieve  that  the  risks  are more  on  the  up  side.Our own  forecasts  are  now a bit  more pessimistic  than  theGreenbook.  We  think  1995  will  have more  overshooting on  theemployment  side  and a greater risk of  inflation  than  is  embodied  inthe Greenbook.  If  this  doesn't  stray too  far  over  the  fence,  we  thinkthat  the  tightening in  the Greenbook  is  about  the minimum  that  isneeded.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Peter Fisher  has  an  announcement that  Ithought  we  ought  to  interpose.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  He's  not  here,  but  maybe  I can make it.  He  canclarify the  facts  later, but  let  me  just  state  that  at  about  9:30,  theMexicans  did announce  that  they had moved  their  intervention band by15  percent  and will  continue  to  crawl  that band by  four new centavos  aday.  So,  they basically have  moved the  band by  15  percent.  We  don'thave any market  quotes--

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  [Re-entering  the meeting]  Actually, we do.  Thepeso  has  traded  at  3.83  to  3.86,  down  about  11  percent  from yesterday;it  has  not  approached  the  outer band at  all.  Screens  in New York arenot  quoting  the Mexican  stock market, but  talking  to  people  in Mexico,the  decision seems  to  have  been taken well  in Mexican markets.  Eventhough  the ADRs--Mexican stocks  traded  in New York--were  down, reportsindicate  that  Mexican  stocks  are  trading up  in Mexico.  So,  the marketseems  to be  taking  it  well  in Mexico  so  far,  and  the peso  hasn'ttraded  out  to  its  limit.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  To get  good  results on  that  or  at  leastnot disastrous  results  would be very helpful.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The Tenth  Districteconomy continues  to grow at  a healthy pace and gains  remain spreadacross  all  states  and  all  industries.  Our  bank directors  are  almostuniformly positive  about  current conditions  and  the near-term outlookfor  our region.  One  key  example comes  from  the  transportationindustry, where  reports  show strained  capacity resulting  from verystrong demand  for  shipments  of  coal,  autos,  building materials,  and  avariety of  other products.  In almost  every part  of  the District,  wecontinue  to  hear reports  of  shortages of  labor,  spanning  both skilledand unskilled.  Consistent  with  these reports,  current  data shownonfarm  jobs  in  the  District up  almost  3 percent  in  October  from ayear earlier,  about  equal  to  the  nation.  Most  states  added jobs atrates  close  to  the  District  average,  but  a  couple--New Mexico  forexample--were  substantially over  the  average.Manufacturing continues  to  improve, with most of  the  strengthin the  durable  goods  industries.  Our contacts  in the  District's  keyautomobile assembly  plants  tell  us  that  they are  operating at  capacitylevels  following the  changeover  to  new models.  Major expansions  areunder way  in  the  District  for plants producing computer  chips andother computer  equipment.  Construction activity  remains robust  acrossthe  District.  Most  of  the  recent  strength has  been  in public projectswith some modest  slowing  in home  building.  The  energy  sector  is  atleast  stable  over  the  past  few weeks, but  farm  incomes  are probably  onthe weaker  side  for  us,  especially  in  cattle and hog production.  Bankcredit  continues  to  increase at  most  District banks,  with  strong loangrowth offsetting  some  modest decline  in  securities.At  the national  level,  we  are  looking  for growth  in  the  lastquarter  to be  as  much as  5 percent.  I  look  for  that momentum  to  carryforward  into  next  year.  I also  share  the  view that  the  economy  iscurrently operating  beyond long-term potential  levels.  Such measuresas  the  unemployment  rate  and capacity utilization certainly  suggestthat  and perhaps  even an  overheating  economy.  At  the  current policystage  and  looking  forward  to  next  year,  I  think we do have  continuedinflationary pressures  that  confront  us  as  we  enter  1995.  With that,to  avoid  going over  the  fence,  I'll  shut up.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman,  economic  activity on  balance  inthe  Seventh District  appears  to  be  even stronger  than  at  the  time  ofour  November meeting.  Like  the  Greenbook, we have raised  our estimatefor  real  GDP growth  for  the  fourth quarter,  and  I expect  it  to  be  inthe  5 percent  range.  It  also  seems  likely  that  rapid growth willpersist  into  the  first  quarter  of  1995,  with  some  likelihood  of  growthin  excess  of  3 percent.  With real  GDP  already slightly  abovepotential  output,  this  robust  pace  of  real  activity threatens  togenerate  a noticeable  increase  in  CPI  inflation  later  in  1995,  movinginflation above  the Greenbook  forecast.  Indicators  of  consumeractivity  in  the  Seventh District remain quite  robust.  For most  of  the12/20/94-11-District,  the  holiday sales  season is  running very strong,particularly  for  such durables  as personal  computers,  electronics,appliances,  and big  screen televisions.  Only sales  of  soft  goods  suchas  apparel have  lagged.The District's  manufacturing  sector continues  strong afterthe  summer supply disruptions  in  the  automobile  industry.  Auto andlight  truck sales  are  running at  about  a 15-1/2  million unit  annualrate  in  the  fourth quarter.  Although availability continues  toconstrain  sales  for some models,  many of  the problems  should beresolved over  the  next  six months,  allowing domestic producers  tocontinue to  gain market  share.  Over  the next  six months,  the  BigThree  automakers  plan to  boost  light  truck capacity at  existing plantsby about  800,000  units  through a number of  changes  to productionprocesses.  Production schedules  for  the  first  half of  1995  are quiteaggressive,  up 4 percent  in  the  first  quarter  from  strong year-agolevels  and up  5 to  6 percent  in the  second quarter.  While  this  is  avery upbeat assessment,  some  extremely tentative  signs  of  moderationin automobile  sales were reported to  us  just  recently.  Specifically,reports  yesterday from  two major automobile manufacturers  revealedsome  softness  in demand at  the  dealer level.  Although retail  salesremain  strong, some  dealers have pared back their  orders  frommanufacturers, possibly as  a result  of declines  in  showroom traffic,unexpected increases  in  stocks,  or higher interest  rates.  Inresponse,  one  manufacturer has  taken  the unusual  step of  trimming  itsproduction plans  and reducing overtime  levels at  several plants.Although  it  is  too  early  to  attach much weight  to  these  reports,  theyshort-term rates.Heavy-duty truck sales  were  strong again  in  October,  and itnow looks  as  if  sales  for  all  of  1994 will  set  a new record high.Orders also  remain brisk, with the  backlog  extending into next  year'sfourth quarter.  The backlog is  due  at  least  in part  to  producersallowing customers  to  lock  in  current prices  and avoid expected priceincreases  next year  if  they are willing  to  accept  later delivery.Significant  strength is  also  evident  in  our District's  steel,  machinetool,  and  office furniture  industries.In the  agricultural  sector,  the  situation is  more mixed.  Itappears  that  some slowing has  occurred in  sales  of  farm  equipment,especially for  large  tractors  and combines.  Still,  domesticmanufacturing schedules  are up  strongly  in November and apparently inlarge meat  supplies,  particularly  for hogs.  On  the  other hand, cropby  the  heavy use  of  government price support programs,  especiallyamong farmers  in District  states.  Upward price pressures  are reportedfor  food packaging costs,  including very steep  25  to  30  percentincreases  in corrugated cardboard prices, with  another increaseexpected in January, as  well  as  increases  in  prices  of  tinplate  andbottles  used as  beverage containers.  In addition,  the  explosion  of  amajor fertilizer  plant  in  Iowa has  added temporary pressures  to  tightsupplies  and sizable price  increases already evident  for  fertilizer.On the  employment  front,  labor  markets  continue  to  firm.Auto-related employment  is  at  its highest  level  since  1979,  andoverall  manufacturing employment  in the  District  is  back to  its  198912/20/94-12-level.  In  Michigan,  the unemployment  rate  in November  was  the  lowestsince  the  end of  1969,  and  in  Illinois,  the  rate was  the  lowest  sincethe  late  1970s.  Moreover,  surveys  of  employer hiring plans  in  theMidwest are  the  highest  in at  least  18  years.  The  tightening  inDistrict  labor markets  has been accompanied by more  frequent reportsof upward pressure  on wages  due  to  labor  shortages.Overall,  Seventh  District  economic  activity is  consistentwith the  national economy.  It  has  continued to  grow at  a rate  that,if  maintained, would  lead to  increasing  inflationary pressures.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Twelfth District's  economy  isgrowing  solidly.  Outside  of California,  the pace  of  growth ismoderating  in  some  of  the  intermountain  states,  although Oregon'seconomy  seems  to  be  accelerating.  Economic  indicators  for  Californiashow  continued improvement,  aside  from  the  financial problems  inOrange County.The  current  estimate  of  the Orange  County  investment pool'slosses  is  $2 billion, but  the ultimate  loss  probably is  going  to beslightly higher.  That  $2 billion  is  equivalent  to  around  2-1/2percent of  Orange  County's $75  billion personal  income  or  around  .3percent of  total  state  income.  However,  the  comparison with a  singleyear's personal  income  overstates  the economic  impact  of  the  financiallosses,  since  a large  proportion of  the  funds  was  earmarked forcapital  expenditures  that  are spread  over several  years.  Since  morethan  97  percent  of  the  funds  in the pool  were  invested by governmententities  within Orange  County, most  of  the  economic  effect will  befelt  in Orange  County  itself, which  accounts  for  roughly  10  percent ofCalifornia's  economy.  The county and other  participating governmentsappear  to have been  largely successful  so  far  in  finding ways  to  meetimmediate  cash needs.  There  is  still  a great  deal  of  uncertaintyabout how  the  effects will  be distributed  among  the  affectedjurisdictions.  However,  it  is  clear  that  these  local  governmententities  will  cut  spending substantially.  Orange  County already haspostponed some  large  capital  projects  and put  a  freeze  on  hiring andall  nonessential  spending.  A number  of  other jurisdictions  are makingsimilar moves.One  of  the  immediate  effects  has been  to  raise  the cost  ofborrowing  for Orange  County governments  and  for  the  State  ofCalifornia.  As  was  discussed  earlier,  credit  spreads  rose  onmunicipal  securities  all  over  the  country  after Orange  County filedfor  bankruptcy.  These  spreads  generally have  fallen back to  thelevels  that  prevailed before  the problems  in  Orange  County becamepublic.  The  exception  seems  to  be  the  State  of California.  Creditspreads  on  state  issues  rose more  than on most  other  tax-free  bonds.Subsequently, spreads  have come  down  only a  little  from  their  post-bankruptcy peaks,  and  they remain higher  than  they were before  thebankruptcy.  This might  reflect market speculation  that  the  stategovernment,  which already is  financially weak, eventually will beasked to  bear  some  of  the  cost.  In this  regard,  I should point outthat  in contrast  to  California  State bonds,  the  credit  spreads  foractively traded city and  county issues  within California  look aboutlike  those  for municipals  in  the  rest  of  the  country.12/20/94-13-Exposure  of Twelfth  District banks  to  Orange  County has beenand continues  to  be minimal.  Loans  and direct  holdings of  OrangeCounty debt by banks  are  small,  and  the  same  goes  for  exposures  underletters  of  credit.  However,  a few banks  face  some  indirect  exposurethrough  sponsorship  of  mutual  funds with Orange  County holdings.Sponsors  of  some  affected mutual  funds,  notably the money marketfunds,  bought  the  funds'  holdings  of  Orange  County debt  to  preventtheir  funds  from  realizing  the  full  losses.  In  other words,  theywanted to make  sure  they didn't  "break the buck" on  the money  funds.In general,  the market  seems  to  have differentiated among variousmutual  funds  according  to  the  extent  of  their  Orange  County exposure.We  also  learned that  one of  the banks  that  has  a tax-exempt moneydone  by a  few other banks,  issued  a letter  of  credit  for the  OrangeCounty debt,  which of  course  increased  its price  and reduced  theproblem.I'd like  to  turn to  the  national  economy now and hopefully Iwill  remain on  the  right  side of  the  fence  as  well,  but  I certainlydon't want  to be on  top  of  the  fence.  [Laughter]  The nationaleconomy continues  to  exhibit  surprisingly strong growth  in employment,output,  and  spending.  Indeed, the  evidence  suggests  that  the  currentpace  of  real  economic  activity has  not been diminished very much bythe  tighter stance  of  monetary policy this  year, or  at  least  that  anypolicy  effects have  been more than  offset  by other  factors.Simulations  of  our  own structural  model,  which has  a monetary policyresponse  similar  to  models  such as  DRI's  and Ray Fair's,  suggest  thatthe  tightening  so  far  this  year has reduced  the growth  rate of  GDP byabout  1/2  percentage point  in 1994.  The  tightening also  is  projectedto  reduce GDP  growth  by a full  percentage  point  in  1995,  and another1/2  percentage point  in 1996.  Long bonds  have moved  up more quicklythan  they  often do  in  response  to  a policy tightening;  there werecharts  in  Part  II  of  the  Greenbook that  illustrated  this.  This  earlyincrease  has probably  accelerated the  effects  of  policy, so  a greaterproportion of  the  effects  of  the monetary restraint  than  suggestedabove may  already have been achieved.  I might note parentheticallythat  this  has  a rather  interesting implication  for  the MPS model  whereone-half  of  the  effect  is  in  the  third year.  That  is  very differentfrom  any other model.  The more conventional  models  are  showing afaster effect.Even assuming  that monetary policy tightens  further,  as  inthe Greenbook,  our  structural  model  sees  a  substantial risk  thatinflation in  1995  and  1996  will  be  somewhat  above  its  current  pace.

MR. FORRESTAL.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  economy  in  theSixth  District  continues  to  expand, although  the  pace of  the  expansionhas decelerated  somewhat  from  the  growth  rates we  saw earlier  in  theyear.  Consumer  spending is  holding up quite well.  We had a reboundin  retail  sales  right after  the  Thanksgiving holiday that  hascontinued  this month,  and most  retailers  are now expecting  that  theywill  exceed  last  year's  strong  levels  by as  much as  6 to  8 percent.However,  they  are  also  reporting  that  their  sales  are  dependent  to  alarge  extent  on  special  promotions  and  discounts,  and that  obviouslyis  cutting  into  their  profit  margins.  Big ticket  items  are  sellingparticularly well.  Sales  of  apparel, which  had been weak  for  some12/20/94-14-time,  are also  seeing  strong gains.  We have had reports  starting  inthrough  the  first  half  of December.  Tourism remains  a very brightspot  in  the District  economy.Manufacturing activity was relatively  flat  in  the  SixthDistrict  last month, although most plants  expect to  see  gains  over  thenext six months.  Producers  of  lumber and building materials  areoperating at  or near  capacity, but  several  of  them have noted thatshipments have begun  to decelerate.  The  same pattern  is  showing up  inhome  furnishings and equipment.  In contrast,  activity at  producers ofpaper, pulp, and  chemicals  rose  substantially, and demand for autoparts  is  also  strong.  Again, the  outlook  for  capital  spending was alittle  less  favorable  than  a month ago.Home  sales  in  the  District  fell below  strong year-ago levelsin most  areas,  although realtors  are  reporting that  they expect arebound  in  sales  in  the spring.  Multifamily real  estate marketscontinue  to  improve  and rental  rates  are rising.  Commercial realestate  is  also  doing relatively well  throughout  the  region,  although Ifind it  interesting  that  some architects  report  that  demand for  theirservices  is  in  decline;  that  could imply some  softening  ofconstruction next year.  With respect  to  loan demand, bankers  say  thatit's mixed, with  increased commercial real  estate lending andwith sales.Labor markets  haven't  changed very much  in  the  District sincelast month.  We continue  to  see  labor shortages  reported  in  certainareas.  It's  most pronounced in  Tennessee  and in Atlanta.  In Atlanta,it's  related partly to  the Olympics  and partly to  retailers who arefinding it  very difficult  to  get people  for  the  holiday  sales period.Skilled construction workers  are  in  strong demand  everywhere, andwages  in  that  industry are rising  sharply.As  for  prices,  about  50  percent  of  manufacturers  indicatethat  they  are still  being pressured by  the  rising  costs  of  rawmaterials.  They are noting  difficulty again  in passing  these  costs  onto  final  goods.I would just  add with  respect  to  Orange County  that wehaven't seen  any  fallout  in  our District  from that  episode.Now your  fence  looms  rather  large  in  front  of  me  as  I turn  tothe  national  economy, but  let  me  go  at  it  this way  if  I may.  We,  too,were surprised  by the  rapid rate  of  growth  in  1994  and by  therelatively  low inflationary response  to  that growth.  As opposed  tothe  last  couple of  meetings, we did not  run  forecasts  with  anassumption of  tightening.  We did  it  with constant  federal  funds  thistime.  It's  interesting that  our GDP  forecast  through the  fourthquarter  of  1996  brings  the rate  of  growth  in  real GDP  down  to  aboutthe  2.5,  2.6  percent  level  throughout  that  period without  anytightening at  all.  The  CPI  through that  period is  higher,  as  youwould expect,  than the Board's  forecast,  but  it  remains  at  about  a3.2,  3.3  percent  level  throughout  1995  and 1996,  with the unemploymentrate  somewhat below the  Greenbook forecast.  That  raises  the  questionin  my mind--and I think I raised  this  last  time--whether  or not  thereis  something different  going on  in  the economy this  time  around that12/20/94-15-would suggest  that potential  growth  is  higher  and the  NAIRU is  lower.But  I  think the basic  question  is  whether or  not  there  can be  greatergrowth  in  the  economy with  less  inflation,  thereby  implying  somewhatless  tightening  than  is  forecast  in  the  Greenbook.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Our directors  and other business  contactscontinue  to  report  generally robust  activity in our  region with  just  acouple  of  exceptions  that  I'll  mention  in  a minute.  I guess  the  moststriking anecdotal  information we  have  gotten  lately has  to  do withlabor market  conditions,  which as  a number of  other people have  notedfor  their  Districts  appear  to  be  tightening  very noticeably  throughoutour region.  At  our  last  board meeting about  10  days  ago,  we hadseveral  reports  of  shortages  in  both retail  help  and constructionworkers.  The  shortage  of  construction labor  is  said to  be  pushingconstruction costs  up  in North Carolina.  Also  in  November, WestVirginia posted  the biggest monthly  increase  in jobs  ever  in  thatstate, and  it  was  quite  broadly based across  the West Virginiaeconomy.Elsewhere, most  of  the  information we have  on holiday saleshas  been positive.  Also  on  the positive  side  of  the  ledger, we  seeincreasingly clear signs  of a  firming  of  conditions  in commercial  realestate  markets  in  a number  of  local  areas.  Actual  construction hasnot  accelerated markedly yet, but  commercial  vacancy rates  aremetropolitan areas,  and  there  is  talk about  increases  in  other  areasnot  too  far down  the  road.  Prime space  has become  increasingly hardto  come by, especially  large  blocks  of  it.Lest  you think  the  only news  we  ever  listen  to  in our  Bank  isgood news,  let me mention a  couple  of  signs  of possible moderation  inactivity  in  some  sectors  in  our region.  We do  a monthly survey ofmanufacturing activity  in  the  Fifth District,  as  a number  of  otherReserve Banks  do  in  their respective Districts.  Our November  surveysuggested  fairly significant  slowing  in  activity  in  that  sector, whichis  very important  in  our District.  This  slowing  is  in  some  contrastto  the  published national  data.  Also, we  see  continuing  signs  of  aflattening  in  residential  real  estate  activity across  the  District.At  their  meeting a few days  ago,  our  Charlotte directors  said  thatbuyer traffic  for  single-family homes  had hit  a wall  in  the month  ofanecdotal  information, but  it  does  seem a  little  at variance with  someother  things  we  have heard.Finally,  with respect  to prices  in  the  District,  our  latestmonthly survey  suggests  that  both manufacturers  and  retailers  are  nowexpecting  somewhat sharper  price increases  over  the  next  six monthsthan  they were  just  a  few weeks  ago.Nationally, of  course,  the broad contour  of  the  Greenbookforecast hasn't  changed a  great deal.  The  thing  that  struck me  isthat--there  has  been  some  comment about  it  already--in  spite  of  thestrong projected growth near  term, the  bulge  in the  CPI  predicted forthe  first  quarter  of  next year  is  noticeably  less pronounced  than  itwas  in  the November Greenbook.  Inflation  remains  relatively  steadyover  the whole  two-year  forecast  horizon.  I think Mike's  comments12/20/94-16-suggested fairly  that  projections  key  off  of  the  recent  favorableactual  inflation  data rather  than  the  apparent strength  in  realeconomic  activity and  the  strong  job growth and  low unemployment  rate.Let me  just  say that  I don't  envy the  staff's  task  indeveloping  this  forecast.  I think  developing any  kind of  reasonableand  credible  forecast  in  this  situation  is  exceedingly difficult  andthe  forecast  we  have  is  certainly plausible.  Still,  I  think we haveto  recognize  that  this  projection can be described  as relativelyoptimistic  under the  circumstances.  There are  considerable risks  inthe  forecast  at  this point,  greater perhaps  than  we have  seen earlier.I think  these risks  are probably somewhat  more balanced  than  they havebeen up  to  now, but  there  still  are substantial  upside  risks.  As weall  know,  the  economy  is  clearly very strong;  it's  really roaring Ithink;  but  there  are  quite a  few signs  of  weakness  here  and there.There  is  a  lot  of  talk  about passing  intermediate-level priceincreases  through  to  final prices  at  the  beginning of  the  year.  So  Ithink there  is  certainly a possibility, more  than marginal,  that wecould begin  to  see  the  economy overheat  as  we move  into next  year andsee  an  inflation rate  significantly higher  than  the  rate  the  Greenbookis  projecting.  At  the  same  time,  I think  the  downside  risk  on  thereal  side  as  we get  out  into  late  1995  and early  1996  is  greater nowthan  it  has been, especially given  the  further  tightening  of policythat may be needed  to  contain  inflation going  forward.  Because  ofthis--and  I'm going  to  step  on your  fence if  I may here  just  briefly,Mr.  Chairman--while  I think some  additional  restraint  will  almostcertainly be  required before  this  thing  is  over,  I believe we need  tobe  somewhat  more cautious  in applying  it  than was  necessary earlierthis  year when we were  further  away from a cyclical  peak and when wehad a  serious  credibility problem.Speaking of  credibility, I  think the  recent  behavior  of  thebond rate  suggests,  to me at  least,  that  we have  acquired  some oflate.  In my view, that  is  the most  encouraging development we haveseen  in some  time.  The  trick  is  going  to  be  to  maintain  it  goingforward as  we move  into  a situation  where the  risks  are  at  least  alittle more balanced  than  they have been.  I might  just note  onceagain  if  I may  that  precisely in this  kind of  situation,  somethinglike  an  inflation  target might  be  helpful.

MR. STERN.  Thank you.  For  the  most part,  the  Ninth Districteconomy remains very strong;  much of  it  is  operating  at  fullemployment or maybe  even  beyond.  Two  interesting pieces  ofinformation have become  available  since  the  last  meeting.  On theanecdotal  side,  I  think there  is  some  accumulating  evidence  thathousing  is  slowing down, both sales  and  construction activity--thatthere  has been some  response to  higher  interest  rates.  I wouldn't  saythat  the  supporting  information  is  overwhelming, but  I  think  there hasbeen  enough  of  it  to  indicate  some  effect  in  our  area.  Secondly, wedid have  a meeting with a  large number  of Twin City business  leadersseveral  weeks  ago,  and  I would  say the  general  tenor of  that meetingwas  that  whatever we have here, we  don't have  equilibrium.  What  Imean is  that most  of  their talk was  about  labor  shortages  across  theboard,  from  the  skilled  to  the  entry level  jobs.  That market hasn'tcleared.  It  has not  resulted yet  in  a lot  of wage  pressures, althoughpeople  talk  frequently about raising wages  in one  part of  the  pay12/20/94-17-scale or  another.  But  it  sounded to  me  as  if  there  is more  to  come,that we clearly  have some disequilibrium.  The  same  thing was  truewhen  they discussed what  they were  seeing in  terms of  crude  andintermediate materials  prices and  availability.  There  obviously arepressures  there.  It  sounded to  me as  if  there  is more  to  come  andthat  ultimately that will  put pressure on  final  goods prices.  Nowwhether  this  results  in simply a blip  in inflation at  the  consumerlevel  or  something more  sustained  remains  to be  seen.  But  clearlythere  is  a lot  of  pressure.  If  these people  are representative,  thereis  a lot  of pressure coming.With regard to  the national  outlook,  I guess  what  I found  themost  surprising part of  the  Greenbook forecast,  something that peoplehave  already commented on, was  the  inflation  outlook.  If  I used  theGreenbook  type  of  framework, which as  I understand it  relies  a lot  oncapacity pressures  to  drive  inflation, and  look at  how the  economy hasperformed and where we are  in terms  of  the unemployment  rate  andcapacity utilization and so  forth,  I think  I would come  out with a lotmore  inflation over  the  next  several  quarters than  is  there.  Myconcern  is  that we  could get an  acceleration of  inflation--the 1/4point or  so  that  the Greenbook  seems  to  envision is  just  noise.  Thatcould happen or not  happen depending on  a lucky or unlucky break ortwo.  My judgment would be  that  if  we get  an acceleration  ofinflation, we will  not need a magnifying glass  to  discern  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  the point  I was  trying to makebefore,  Gary.  This  business of  a 1/2  percentage point  increase  ininflation at  an  annual  rate  as  though that means  anything--

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  You can go  from  0.2  to  0.3  of  a point--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You can  round the numbers  to  the nearest5 percent!

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  You can go  from  0.2  to  0.3  percent per month andthat gives you  a percentage point right  there.  On a monthly basis,  itdoesn't  look  like  very much.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The economy  in  the  Eleventh District  continuesto  show the  same  healthy rate  of  growth  that  has been  in placethroughout  1994.  We have been  looking intensively  for  signs  ofslowing  activity in  response to  tighter monetary policy.  So  far  theonly perceptible  slowdown has been  in  single-family  construction,which peaked  in April,  but  this  decline  has been more than  offset bystrong  activity in  multifamily and nonresidential  construction.  Therehas  been no  slowing in  the  rate  of  expansion  of  the most  interest-rate-sensitive  sectors of  our manufacturing  industries--rubber,plastics,  lumber, nonelectrical and  electrical machinery, primary andfabricated metals,  furniture, paper,  stone,  clay, glass,  all  of  those.Defense-related and energy-related manufacturing are  the  only areasother  than  single-family construction  that  show signs  of weakness.  Icontinue to  hear  scattered  reports  of  price and wage pressures,  butthe  number of  these  reports  seems  to  have  dissipated since  the  lastFOMC  meeting.  Nonetheless, capacity constraints  are  strong andpossibly intensifying for  electronics, petrochemicals,  and paperproducts.  Wage pressures are  reported in the  electronics,12/20/94-18-telecommunications,  fabricated metals,  and  trucking  industries.  Firmsin the  temporary help  industry expect  even greater difficultyrecruiting  skilled workers  next  year, which could put  even morepressure  on  wages and prices.  In  spite  of growing pressures on wagesin several  industries  and  rising materials prices  in  a number ofothers,  we have  seen little  evidence  of price  rises on  final  goods  andservices,  especially at  the  retail  level.  In  fact,  our  Beigebookcontacts  in the  retailing sector  tell  us  that  intensified competitionin recent  months  has brought  the  average of  their selling prices  belowthose  of  a year  ago.As  the  Greenbook points  out,  we have all  consistentlyunderestimated the  strength of  the  economy  throughout  this year.  Allthe  risks  seem to  be  on  the  up  side  at  this  stage  with  respect  to  realgrowth  as  well  as  inflationary pressures.  The  improvement  of  jobprospects,  consumer  confidence,  and  credit availability are  propellingstrong  growth  in  the  consumer sector.  The need to  add  to  capacity  isputting upward pressure  on  investment  spending.  Stronger  economies  inEurope  and Latin America will  be  increasing our  export  demand.  Thereis  nothing  in  the new  fiscal  policy proposals  that  would stifle  thesedemand pressures.  Quite  the  contrary, the  anticipation  of  tax  cutswill  likely  add  to demand pressures,  capacity constraints,  and priceand wage pressures in  the  coming months.  Mr.  Chairman,  I'll  defer  thenext  sentence!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I don't  know how successful  this  is.[Laughter]  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  TheSecond District  continued recent  trends  of  a robust  economy  in NewJersey and  a slowing expanding  economy  in New York  State.  Data forthe most recently  available month  indicate  that  employment  grew 2.7percent in New Jersey and stagnated  in New York.  Consumer  salesthroughout  the District  in November  grew quite moderately, but  thedata and  the  anecdotal  evidence  indicate a  strong  Christmas  season  inall parts  of  our  District.On  the  national  level,  I feel  that  there  is  great  uncertaintyabout where  the  economy is  going,  or  at  least  I am very uncertain.  Ido  not believe  that  growth  in  the very  strong fourth  quarter, whichcould well  be  4-1/2  to  5 percent or  even more,  is  the  real  world but  ahappenstance of  all  possible positive  elements  coming  together.  If  itis  not  too  good  to  be  true,  at  least  it  would seem  too  good  tocontinue,  and  growth next  year should  slow down  to  a sustainable  pace.Our Q4/Q4  GDP  growth  forecast  for  1995  under current policyassumptions  is  2.4  percent with  the  CPI  at  3.3  percent and going up.We think that  the  cost pressures  that have been discussed by manypeople probably  are already baked  in  the  cake.The  greatest uncertainty  is  to  figure  out  where currentmonetary policy  is  and its  effect  on  the  economy.  Is  it  tight and,  iftight,  in  relation  to  what?  We did  some work on  comparing  the presentpolicy  stance  at  full  employment, and we  tried to  find  some previousperiods when  one  could  say the  economy was more  or  less  in  the  samemacro performance position.  We came  up with April  1972,  May 1978,  andindicators  of  whether monetary policy  is  tight  or  not.  If  you  look atthe  real  fed  funds  rate, which we  compared with the  latest  12-month12/20/94-19-CPI,  it's  now 2.6  percent,  which is  considerably tighter  than  in  the1970s  and somewhat  tighter  than  in  1987.  The monetary  aggregates, M1and M2,  are very much  tighter  than in  all  the  previous  comparisonperiods.  The  Treasury yield curve is  flatter, which would indicatethat  the market  feels  that  policy is  better  positioned than  it  was  inthose previous periods.  Even the  crude  PPI,  which has  been rathertroublesome  lately,  if  you  look over  the  12-month trend it  tooindicates  that price  performance  is  better,  and  therefore  one wouldthink that  monetary policy may well  be  tighter.  I'm not  sure  thatthat  tells  us  that  current monetary policy  is  perfect.  It  doesn'ttell  me whether  it's  a  little  too  tight  or  a  little  too  loose  or  verymuch, except  that  it  tells me  that  if  I were  to  leap  over what  tinybit  of  fence  remains,  that waiting might  have something  going  for  it.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sounds  like  a leap  to  me.  PresidentJordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  With  regard to  Orange County-typedevelopments,  before  that  drove  everything else  off  the newspapers,  wewere  getting  a number  of  similar reports  in  our area.  Cuyahoga Countylost  $150  million, which  they say  is  equivalent  to  a new  footballstadium,  so we have  a  team for  sale.  And  it  appears  now that  thestate held  $900  million  of  stripped bonds  that  are  deeply under  water.So,  we are  going  to  see  significant  reductions  in waste,  fraud, abuse,and underemployed people  on  county  and  state payrolls!  These peoplewill be  going to  work,  fortunately, because  they are  going  to  find avery good labor market.I focused  this  time mostly  on manufacturing.  Manufacturingemployment  in our  District  is  almost  50  percent above  the  nationalaverage;  it's  really  the main part  of  the  Fourth District  economy.With only one  exception, manufacturers  said that  the  NAM presidentdoes  not  speak for  them.  Sometime people volunteered this  to  me;sometime  I sought out  their views.  If  there  is  a NAIRU in  the  FourthFederal  Reserve District,  I would say  it's  a  lot  lower  than  it  isassumed to  be  for  the  nation because  our  unemployment rates  are  4percent  or  less  in most  of  our metropolitan areas.  And yet  I stilldon't  sense  any change  in people's  attitudes  about what will  happen  toinflation  in  the  future.  People  talk about  very tight  labor markets.I continue  to  hear the  same  stories  about  shortages  of  skilled andunskilled workers,  yet  it  doesn't  seem  to be  getting built  intopeople's plans.  They may be  looking  to  that  reservoir  of  previouslydiscouraged workers  that  was  supposed to  have  existed, or  thedisguised unemployed that  we  are supposed  to  have  inherited fromearlier periods,  or  the  otherwise underemployed people  out  there.  Butif  they exist,  they  live  in  other Districts  and we  are  having  toimport  them;  we have  reversed  the population  flows  and are  gettingsome  in-migration.  Our manufacturers  talk  about paying hiring  bonusesand performance  bonuses  based on  having  had a very good year, but  theyare  not building pay  increases  into  their wage bases  in order  toattract  or  to  retain workers.  One of  the  states,  Kentucky, recentlysuspended its  program  to  attract  businesses  to  the  region  because  theysimply view their  labor market  as  so  tight  that  going  out  and  tryingto  steal  companies  from other  regions  of  the  country was not  a veryprofitable  thing to  be  engaged  in.  The  person who  told me  this  wasvery disappointed because he  heads up  that  program and he  was not  surewhat  he was  going  to  be doing.12/20/94-20-I talked  to  the  CEO of  one  of  the  giant  companies  that mainlysupplies  the motor vehicles  industry, especially heavy  trucks,  andalso produces  other  equipment.  With regard  to  his  capital  expenditureplans  for  the  longer  run,  whether  for  increasing capacity  or makingproductivity-enhancing  investments,  I asked him what  assumptions hemade  about  future price increases.  He  said  zero.  He  was very  adamantin  saying  that  it  would be  irresponsible  for  any  industrial  leader  inAmerica  today to  assume  that  they can plan on any price  increases  fortheir output.  Instead,  capital  expenditure proposals  are  evaluated onthe basis  of  their ability to  achieve  the productivity  increases  tomatch any  cost  increases  in labor  or  other resources.  I thought  thiswas  at  least  one  bit  of  evidence  that what we are  trying  to  achieve--stability in  the purchasing power  of  money--is  beginning to  take  holdin the  minds  of  our business  people.Another  industrial  leader  from a very  large company  thatsupplies paints  and other  chemical products  approached me  saying  thatwe must have  an  immediate  and very substantial  increase  in  the  federalfunds  rate.  And,  of  course,  I was  curious  and  asked him why he  feltthat  way.  Was  he  concerned about  inflation?  He  said absolutely not,because  he  could not  increase  his prices.  In  fact,  he  said  that  hewas  trying  to  hold the  line  and resist  pressure  to  reduce his  pricesbecause of  increased competition.  But his  costs  were  killing him andthe  Fed needed to  raise  the  funds  rate  in  order to  reduce  those  costs.Small  and  large manufacturers  in  the  District  are doing  verywell  in the  export  markets,  especially  exports  to Mexico  and Canada.District  exports  have posted  strong increases  in  the  last  two  or  threeyears,  and companies  that had never  engaged at all  or  significantly inthese markets  are  now finding  them very attractive  and are doing  quitewell.  I hear  a lot  of  reports  of  plans  to  increase  capacity in  thenext  year or  two  as  well  as  continuing  emphasis  on  labor-savinginvestments.Turning  to the  national  economy,  I can understand why peoplewho believe  that  the  growth that  we  have had in  1994  is  the result  ofprior demand stimulus  would  feel  that  we ought  to  take  that  stimulusout before  it  spills  over  into  excess  demand and  therefore  risingprices.  It  is  a  legitimate point  of view.  It  is  not  clear to  me whywe didn't  recognize  that  excess  demand  earlier  and therefore  make  abetter  forecast  for  1994  if  we  knew  that  that  was  what was  going on.to  consider an  alternative  interpretation of  what we have beenexperiencing  this  year and  that  is  that  it  is  the dividend  for priorrestraint.  We  should have  expected  that policy actions  to reduceinflation and  to  build our  credibility on  the  inflation  rate wouldproduce  the  type  of  output  increases  that  we  have  had.  Therefore,what  has been  going on  this  year  is  not  the  sort  of  thing  thatnecessarily spills  over  into  rising prices  and higher  inflation  in thefuture.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  In  the  third quarter,  nominal  GDP was up  6.7percent  from  a year  earlier,  the  largest  year-over-year  rise  in  fiveyears.  More  recently, nominal  retail  sales  rose at  a  15.1 percentannual  rate  from July to  November,  the  fastest  four-month pace  sincethe  spring  of  1987.  There  are  few  signs yet  that  our monetary policy12/20/94-21-actions  have  slowed  the pace of  spending.  Since March,  for  example,business  loan  growth has  accelerated to  an  11.1  percent  rate,  afterfalling  in  1993.  Nevertheless,  in  my view monetary policy has  shiftedtoward restraint.  All monetary aggregates have  shown relatively weakgrowth  since  spring.  Inventory investment  has  been very strong  thisyear.  In my view rapid  inventory accumulation has been  desired and islikely  to  continue  for  a time.  Despite rapid inventory  accumulationso  far  this  year, the  inventory-to-sales ratio has remained near  thelowest  level  since  the early  1950s.  According to  a recent  survey byour  staff,  attempts  in  the Eighth  District  to  build inventory,especially  of  finished goods,  have  been unsuccessful  simply because  ofcontinuing  strong  sales  growth.  One  major motor  vehicle manufacturerin  the  Eighth  District reported  that  it  held larger  stocks  than  itstwo  domestic  competitors  simply because,  in contrast  to  its  rivals,  ithad  the  capacity to  keep  production closer  to  the pace  of  sales.  Evenso,  this  firm has had difficulty  in  keeping  its  strongest  sellingmodels  in  stock.  Such  observations  matched the concern with  respectto  the nation  as  a whole  expressed  in  the National Association ofPurchasing Managers  surveys  in  October  and November.In November,  employment gains  exceeded  the robust  averagemonthly increases  from January to  October and were more  than  twice  aslarge  as  the  average  monthly rise  in  the  civilian  labor  force.  EighthDistrict  unemployment  fell  to  4.7  percent  in  October,  its  lowest  levelsince August  1974.  That's  a  level  at  which we have  been hovering  forsome  time.  On a comparably measured basis,  the nation's unemploymentrate has  fallen  to  its  March  1989  level,  which  in  turn was  the  lowestsince December  1973.Notwithstanding  this  evidence  of  strength  on  the  real  side,the  positive  reaction of  the bond and  other  financial markets  inrecent  weeks  is  heartening.  I hope  this means  that  the markets  nowbelieve  that  the  long-term  inflation rate  will  not accelerate  from itscurrent  level.  Whether the  nearly universal  expectation  thatinflation  over  the  near  term, or  the  long  term  for  that  matter, willbe  3 percent  or more  is  acceptable is  another question, as  is  whetherwe act  today  in  terms  of  any  short-term actions.  I am not  at  allaverse  to  strong  cyclical  real  growth  if  the  thrust of  our policy isconsistent with long-run price  stability  and we  have  credibility.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Unfortunately, President Boehne  had  toleave because  of  an  emergency he  had to  attend  to.  I'd like  to  askRick Lang whether he  could give  us  a brief  survey of  what  is  going  onin the  Third  District.

[SECTION]

MR. LANG.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The Third Districteconomy continues  to  expand but  at  a more moderate  pace than  in thenation as  a whole.  Employment  levels  in  several  areas  of  the  Districtstill  have not  reached their pre-recession  levels.  Manufacturingactivity continues  to  be  one of  the  strong points;  its  levels  continueto  be  high, although not  as  high  as  in earlier months.  Retailers  aretelling us  that  they are experiencing good holiday sales,  especiallysales  of  durable goods.Housing activity  around the  District  remains  mixed, with  onlya  few areas  in  the District  showing  signs  of  strength.  There  are somesigns  of  increases  in  nonresidential building activity, although  thisis  not  translating  into  substantial  gains  in  construction employment12/20/94-22-at  this  point.  Bank lending  around  the  region is  up but  also not  asstrongly as  in  the nation  as  a whole.  That  is  particularly true  ofbusiness  lending.  Price pressures  continue  to  be  evident  in  themanufacturing  sector,  but  they do  not  appear  to  be  widespread aroundthe  region.  Also,  although we  do  not  have evidence  of  strongpressures  on wages  in  the region,  we do  hear  of  more cases  of  signingbonuses  being given  to workers  in  some  sectors  of  the Districteconomy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I'll  try and  stayentirely on  the  right  side  of  the  fence  by talking  about  fiscalpolicy!  [Laughter]  I have  three  observations  to  make:  First,  we arenow  getting the  first  indications  of  the  effects  of  the  1993  tax lawchanges.  I have presented scoring  stories  to  this  group before.  Iwant  to  stress  that  what we  have are  very preliminary indications,  butthey are  from both  the macro  aggregate  level  and  from detailed microdata  that were published in  Statistics  of  Income.According  to  our  staff  estimates,  if  you  look at  a liabilitymodel  estimate  of  what  taxpayers owed,  in  1992  it  was  $498  billion  andin  1993  it  was  $522  billion.  We had a net  gain of  $24  billion  inliabilities.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  for  individuals?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Yes,  I'm looking  at  the  individuals'  side  here.Personal  income rose  4.3  percent between  1992  and  1993.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What was  it  without  transfer payments?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Slightly below that--4.1  percent.  But  thereare  offsetting  factors.  I could go  on  for  too  long,  but you don'twant  me  to.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  The  general  approach  to  estimating, given  theadjustments  the  Chairman  is  talking about,  would be  to  take per-tax-return personal  income.  The elasticity  of  receipts  with respect  toper-return  personal  income based  on  the  index used  for  inflation  is1.0.  The  elasticity for  real  increases  is  about  1.5.  The  inflationindex  for  1993  was  2.8  percent.  So we would  expect,  if  nothing hadchanged  in  the  law, about  a 5 percent  overall  increase  in nominalreceipts  or  $25  billion.  We  got  $24  billion, which doesn't  leave anyroom  for  revenue  from  the  tax  increase.  Looked  at  from  an  alternativepoint  of  view, the  estimated  revenue  from  the  tax  rate  increase was$15  billion.  So,  that  would leave  $9 billion  left  over,  or  anincrease  of about  1.8  percent  attributable  to  economic  growth.  So,  wewould have  to  assume  that  receipts  grew at  only about  40  percent  ofthe  rate  of  increase  in nominal  income, which  is  also  implausible.The micro  data tell  a very similar  story.  These  are early tax  returnestimates  and every year  the  Statistics  of  Income  publishes an  earlycompilation.  I would stress  that  the  data are  early.  What  I want  tocontrast  is,  for  the  same  type  of  sample,  the  top  763,000  taxpayerswhich  in  1992  were  those making  over  $200,000.  Overall  AGI  for  thosetaxpayers  rose  .4 percent  versus  2-1/2  percent  for  other  taxpayers.12/20/94-23-But when you break down the  composition  of  income you  get a patternthat  I think strikingly suggests  an enormous  behavioral response.  Forexample, looking at  Schedule C income,  which is  notoriouslysusceptible to  changes  in  tax rates,  people making under  $200,000  didnot have  a bad year;  they gained about  3 percent, but  the  rich peopledid  terribly.  They had a decline of  43  percent  in  their reportedbusiness  income.  And while corporate profits  for C Corporations  didgreat  in  1993,  and partnership and S Corp profits  for people makingunder $200,000  rose  28  percent,  those  sorts  of  profits  fell  25  percentfor people who were  affected by the  tax rate  increase.  The  thirdparameter  that  is  probably most  susceptible  to  tax rate behavioralresponses  is  charitable giving.  Where overall  charitable  giving roseabout 3 percent,  charitable giving by those making  over  $200,000  rose41  percent.  If  we add up  the  dollar changes here,  a $5.5  billionincome,  and  $2.9 billion  in  extra charitable deductions,  just  lookingat  those  three  factors we get  a shortfall  from  1992  levels  of  $22.3billion that  would have been taxed at  an average  rate of  38  percent.That  would give  us  a shortfall  of  $8.5  billion.  In other words, morethan half  of  the  tax  increase was  offset by behavioral  responses.  Ifound it  striking because both  the micro  and macro data point in  thesame direction.I think that  that  type  of  evidence plus  evidence  that hasaccumulated over  the  last  15  years  is  going to  lead  to  some modestchanges,  and  I want  to  emphasize  the  word  "modest,"  in the  scoringprocess  that  Congress  will  use.  But  I do  want  to  disagree--and  Irarely do--with Bob McTeer's  observation.  I think  that  we should keepin mind a number  of  effects with regard  to  what  is  going to  happen  tofiscal policy.  In my mind the  short-term effects of  fiscal policywill  probably be contractionary.  To  explain why,  first,  I think thedynamic will  be  to produce  a near-term balanced change  in  the  overallscoring.  There are  two  philosophical  reasons why  the new  leadershipin  the  House  should do  that.  First, Newt  is  a political  philosopher,and his basic  strategy is  to  reverse  the  observation  that all  politicsis  local,  which  is  Tip  O'Neill's  approach, where you buy off  thetaxpayers in  your District by putting up a project and  they don't  careabout the  national effect, meaning  the  tax implications.  The  electionwas  run on a reversal of  that  strategy.  And so  I think if  you'replacing yourself  in Newt's  shoes  as  a political  strategist, you wantboth  to pay off  your  constituents and punish the  opposition.  Thatrequires both tax  cuts  and  spending  increases.In addition,  I think  the  lesson of  the  iron triangle  is notlost,  and there will  be intentional  efforts  to  try and weaken  thelong-term  effects of  the  relationship between  the  bureaucracy, Hillstaff,  and the press  by defunding  it.  So  I think we will  see  that  thetiming of  spending reductions will  be much quicker  than anyoneanticipates.  And  they will  be heavily oriented toward what  inWashington we  call  "reductions in  force"  and the  rest  of  the  countrycalls  "firings."  They actually are  not  firings;  they are buyouts.So,  here  is why I'd  like  to  elaborate on  why we  should keep  in mindthat probably the  net effect  of  what we  are going to  see  is  a fiscalcontraction.  With a buyout you give  the  departing  employee  a lump  sumpayment.  That  expands  the  government deficit.  But  the  newly laid  offemployee does  not  run out  and spend his  buyout  immediately;  in  fact,he's a little traumatized  and will  actually cut  back on  spending.  So12/20/94-24-there would be one  example  of where you'd get  an  increase  in  thebudget  deficit which would not  feed back  into  higher aggregate  demand.Second, of  those prospective tax  increases,  I think two  inparticular will  happen.  One  is  a child credit which actually will bedribbled out  over  the  course of  the  entire fiscal  year and may noteven  start until midyear.  So you get  $10  a week in  your paycheck.The  timing of  the median-dollar  fiscal  impetus will be much later thanthe  timing of  the  offsetting dollar  of spending cuts.  The  other  taxcut,  which  is  capital  gains,  I think has clear  timing  issues.  Moreimportant,  I think there  are issues  for  the  effect  on  the marginalpropensity to consume  that  dollar, which  I think  is  probably quitelow.  So,  I believe  the  net  fiscal  impetus  that  is  going  to come  fromthe  budget changes  on  a timing basis is  going  to  be quite negative  for1995  and 1996.  Second,  I think if  we  look  at  the marginal propensityto  consume  issues again,  the  effect on  demand  of  any fiscal  change  isgoing  to be  rather small.  We always  taught  that  the balanced budgetmultiplier was  around 1 in  a very simplified model  or more preciselythat  the  effect  of  a spending  cut  is more  dramatic  than  the  effect  ofa tax change.There  is  a third reason why that's  going to  affect  theeconomy  in  a negative way, and that  is  that  we are going  to  see  Ithink an intensely  regional  distribution of  the  spending changes,mainly focused  in  the northern portions  of  the  Fifth District!  If youwant  any indication  of  that,  go  for  a tour  of  some  of  the  nicersections  of Upper Northwest  section of Washington, and you will  see"For Sale"  signs  just  about  everywhere,  although I think there werelocal  elections which may have affected that  outcome  as well  as  thenational elections.  As  in  the  case  of  defense  spending cutbacks,  Ithink we are going  to  see  a highly regionalized effect.The  third observation  I'd have on  the  net  impact  is  on  theregulatory side.  I think  that  compared to  the  fiscal  actions  theregulatory actions  of  the new Congress will  be extremely  dramatic.Here  I think  the  right model  to  think about  is  what happens  to  GDPwhen you stop  building a pyramid.  I don't mean  to  imply that  all  ofour regulations  are pyramids, but  some have  cost-benefit relationswhich  are  not much better.  When you stop  building a pyramid, you  layoff  workers and you have  a negative effect  on  GDP.  Those workers willeventually find  employment.  Their real  output  will be higher, butthose  real  output  gains will not be  seen  for  two  or  three years.  Ithink we  are going  to  see  a major  change in  the  regulatory apparatus,and particularly  in  the  mandating of  the private  sector and state  andlocal  governments  to  spend money  for  federal  regulatory purposes.  Thenet  result,  I think, will  also  be  contractionary on  the  economy, atleast over  the  forecast horizon.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sounds like  a 30-year bond rate  of  5percent!  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  in the  spirit  of  "contain yourselfto  what you see,"  what  I see  is  what  I've heard all  morning--a verystrong economy where the  risks are  rather heavily skewed  to  the  upside.  Let me  take  just  a minute  to  mention  two other  matters.  Thefirst,  which has been  alluded to  a couple of  times  this morning, isthat  there  may be more  substance  than many of  us  think to  this  wholenotion  that we  have  some  kind of  a new economy with a lower propensity12/20/94-25-toward  inflation.  I am referring  to  this  whole mix of  arguments  thatwe may have  a  lower NAIRU, a new level  of  competition, world marketswith  lots  of  capacity, much higher productivity, and probably  lesssignificant wage pressures  than  one might  expect with this  level  ofemployment.  I have  had a  lot  of  sympathy with that  argument  for  along time  and spoke  to  it  several  times  at  our meetings  during  thespring.  I don't much  doubt  that  that  has  been present  and  is  presentin the  mix of  the  economy right  now.  I  think it  probably  is  asignificant  reason why we have  done as  well as  we  have  so  far  relativeto  the  amount  of  growth  and the  amount  of  inflation that we haveexperienced.  But  I rather  doubt  that  we  can depend  on  that mix ofconsiderations  to  carry us  very much higher in  the  level  of  capacityutilization  than we  already  are  experiencing without  having  that  mixof considerations  exhaust  themselves with higher  inflationarypressures  showing up.The other  thing  I'd like  to  mention  is  that  I am worriedabout  and puzzled by  the  formation of  consumer debt.  I think  therehas  to  be  a  serious  downside risk there,  either  short  term or  longterm.  Consumer  debt  is  off  the  charts  on  the up  side  in relation  toconsumer  income  or net worth, and its  growth should  slow.  There  areprecious  few signs  that  it  is  slowing so  far, but  there  is  a  short-term possibility  that what we  are  seeing  now is  that  the  consumer  isindeed  shopping until  he or  she  drops and  that maybe  the wallet  willclose  after Christmas.  Inventories  could  start  to  build up quickly.That  is  something  to  watch immediately  after Christmas.  If  we don'tget  some  slowing  in  the  near future,  then  I would worry  that  that  isgoing to  imply some  other  types  of  problems  further  on  down the  linethat  could perhaps  be  even more  serious.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  Our  discussion has demonstratedthe depth and  the breadth and  the  resilience of  the  economy.  Theseare  terms  that we usually use  for  market conditions,  but we couldcertainly apply  them  to  this  expansion period.  We  are  closing  in nowon  four years  of  economic  expansion.  Growth  in  three  of  those  yearsis  now indicated  to  have been  above potential  in most  parts  of  thecountry.  It  almost  seems  that  Orange  County  is  the  only place  thatdoes  not  appear  to  be  participating.  A  key question  is  similar  to  theone  that  Governor Kelley  just  posed;  that  is,  when are we  going  to  seestronger signs  of  a slowdown?  So  far we  are hearing and seeingsignificant  signs  of  momentum going  into  1995.  I do  think that  themonetary stimulus  that  extended  from  1989  through  the  first part  of1994  is  causing  a good deal  of  the momentum, and  I don't  think we needto put  too  fine  a point  on  it.  Within that  period we  had  15  months  ofa  3 percent  federal  funds  rate  that  certainly has  had an  influence.  Ido  think that  the  so-called head winds  died down  sometime  in  1993.People became more  comfortable with  their balance sheets,  and  themonetary policy  ease  started  to  show through  significantly into  theeconomic  system.  As  other people  have  said,  these  restructuring headwinds are  now becoming  tail  winds.  We  are now reaping  the benefits  ofthe  earlier balance sheet  restructuring which  is  providing a lot  ofcash for  both businesses  and households  to  spend.  Whereas we  did havea credit  crunch  in  the  banking sector,  now we are  seeing  significantwillingness by banks  to  lend  to both households  and businesses.  Bothbusiness  investment and  construction spending, which had been  a drag12/20/94-26-on  the  economy, are now starting  to  contribute  significantly  to  theexpansion.Well,  at  some point  it  must  stop.  I think that  forecastershave plenty of  room to be humble  as  we end  1994.  It  is  at  leastfeasible  that  consumers  could  slam on  the brakes  early next year--whenthey balance  their  checkbooks when  they  really start  to  assess  howmuch debt  they have taken  on.  Maybe  it  will  happen when they get  thelatest repricing  of  their  ARMs  or when the  wealth effects  start  to hitas  they  get  their year-end mutual  fund statements.  I think people  arebeginning to  realize  that  the paycheck  increases  are not  as  great  asthey have  seen  in  the past.  We may not  have  the  strong  year-endbonuses  in  some areas  that  we have  seen  in past  years.  In  short,  Ithink that  the party for  consumers  is  going to  be  over, but  it  is  notclear how far  the current  momentum  is  going to  carry us  forward fromhere.On the  business  side,  I think  that  the  tail  winds actuallygetting  from re-engineering and  technology investment.  Eventually,monetary policy will  start  to  bite  harder  as  this  pipeline  effectworks  its  way through  the  economy.  We have been  given breathing  spacewith  respect  to  final  consumer price  increases.  We may have beensaved by the bumper grain  crop  that we have  seen  this  year.  Energyprices  backed off.  We have had  a mild autumn.  Ironically, the  labordiscussion around  the  table  today about  labor shortages,  but  alsodiscussion of  the  fact  that  we are  not  seeing big pressures  in wagethat  are being  taken  to  try to  deal  with these  labor  shortages  that  donot  affect  the permanent wage  structure.  I think  that  despite  thefact  that  we  have  a  5.6  percent  unemployment  rate,  there is  still  someconsiderable unrest  in  the  labor  markets.  People  have  jobs,  but  theydon't necessarily have  the  jobs  that  they want or  that  they like.Except  in  some  skilled areas  there  may be more  flexibility  in thelabor market  than we had  thought.  I believe  there  is  a willingnessnow  to move  and change  careers,  and  this  willingness will  be helpfulin containing wage pressures  as  we move  forward.  And certainly on  thebenefits  side,  the  health  cost  containment efforts  have  been helpful.In sum,  as  we move  into  1995  I,  too,  think we  are going  toget  a slowdown, but  the question  is  when and how much.  On the  fiscalside,  I'm not  as  confident  as  Larry Lindsey  in making predictions.  Itseems  to  me  that  everything  is  on  the  table  in  the  Congress.  In  thiscontest  of  wills  that  we  are  about  to  see,  I hope  that  the  loser  isnot  deficit reduction.On  the market  side,  the  financial markets  really haveperformed quite well  given all  of  the  shocks  that  we have  experiencedin  1994,  but  I think there  is more  yet  to  come.  We  have seen quite  anorderly correction  this  year,  but  there may yet be  some  fallout.  JoanLovett and,  of  course,  Bob Parry  talked at  length  about Orange  County.I don't  think we have  seen  all  of  that play out.  I don't  think wehave yet  seen  all  of  the  implications  of  the  Bankers  Trust  situationplay  out.  When people  get  their year-end mark-to-market  statements  ontheir mutual  funds,  there may well be  some  surprises.  I think many ofthe  counties  may still  be  trying  to  figure  out  exactly where  theystand.  So  there may well  be some  shocks  coming in  1995.  The point  of12/20/94-27-that,  of course,  is  that  there  is  considerable uncertainty as  we gointo  1995.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  the  staff projection  for  thefourth quarter  is  correct, we clearly have a more vibrant  economy thanmost of us  had expected and the  surprise  is  the  lack  of  inflationflares  in  the  current  figures.  I am  somewhat puzzled by the  Greenbookprojection  for  the  first quarter  of  1995.  The abrupt  GDP  slowdownseems  to me  to be  counterintuitive.  With  the very high  level  ofcapacity utilization and reduced  slack in  the  labor markets, pressuresare  building  for price  increases  and higher wage  demands  when contractnegotiations begin next  year.  What  I  find puzzling  is  the widespreadexistence of  sales  at  significant discounts  on  every kind ofmerchandise.  Brooks  Brothers has  recently offered  40  percent  off  ontop-of-the-line  goods,  and the  newspapers and catalogs  are  burstingwith ads  for  sales.  Coming during  the  top  selling  season of  the  year,these  sales  would seem  to  support  the  idea  that  price increases  arevery difficult  to  make  stick.  To be  sure,  steel--operating at  orabout 95  percent of  capacity--has  negotiated contracts  for  1995deliveries  at  higher prices.  And that  pattern will  probably spread  inthe near  future  to  other  industries  that  also are  operating at  highlevels of  capacity.  The momentum certainly  seems  to  be  there  foraccelerating growth  in  the  economy even  though  it  is  already burningalong at a rate  well  above potential.  And as  the night  follows  theday, inflation  is  certain  to  be  lurking.  The height  of  the  GreenspanWall prevents me  from completing my prepared remarks  at  this  time.  Iwill wait  for  the  gate  to  open.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think the wall  was  extremely successful.  I'mnot  going to  breach it.  I'm also going  to  be very brief  since,  comingalmost  at  the  end, almost  everything  that  I might  have said--and  itsopposite--has  already been said!  [Laughter]Let  me  take  a few minutes  to  defend  the  conventionality ofthe  Greenbook  forecast  against  some  of  the  objections  that  wereraised.  Although, as  a small  footnote,  in thinking  ahead about myHumphrey-Hawkins  forecast  in  February, my inclination would have  beento  be  a  little higher on near-term growth--1995  growth--and maybe  alittle higher on  inflation.  But  these  are  small  differences.  I wantto defend  the Greenbook both  in the  particulars,  the  kind  of  outlookthat  it  is  pushing--a rapid  deceleration of growth  and a smallincrease  in  inflation--and also  on  the  basic methodology of  beingconventional.  I think there  is  a  lot  to  be  said  for,  and very  littleon  the  other side,  the  staff  of  the  central bank  to  be extremely12/20/94-28-conventional  in  its  methodology and not buy on  to hypotheses  that  havevery little  empirical  support,  although  10  years  later  that might looklike  a good idea.  Usually it  doesn't,  but  it  might.  Speaking as  acitizen and as  a central banker,  I'm glad to  see the  staff  sticking tothe tried and at  least  not  falsified methods!  [Laughter]I agree with  the  Greenbook outlook  that we  probably havepushed a bit past  the  NAIRU.  There  is  a probability distributionaround  this,  of  course, but  the best  guess  is  that  the  economyprobably has pushed a little past  the  NAIRU, or noninflationarycapacity.  I also  agree that  it  is  quite  reasonable  to  expect  a veryconsiderable deceleration of  growth  in 1995  under current policy andthen  a tiny bit more  in  1996  if  there  is  no  further  tightening.  Oneof  the  reasons--Susan Phillips  and  several people have mentioned  it--is  something  that  is  too  easy to  forget:  the  lagged effects  of  thestimulative  monetary policy  that only ended in  February 1994,  and onlyvery slightly at  that.  It  is  even  easier to  forget  the  stimulativeeffect  of  the bond market  rally that peaked in price,  troughed inyield, only in October 1993.  Everything we  know about  lags  ininterest  rates  says  that  those  two  things--the previous  Fed stance andthe bond market  rally attributable  to whatever you want  to  attributeit  to--should be powering the  economy  in 1994.  I think the mainreason behind  the  standard forecasts'  underestimates  of  1994 was  anunwillingness  to  believe  in interest  rate  effects.  It  is  the  samekind  of  thing that  is  happening now;  everyone  is  looking  around  andasking where  it  is,  not believing, and  then  all of  a sudden it  isthere.  This  has happened many, many times  in the  past, and I have nodoubt  that  it  will  happen  in the  future.  And it probably is  happeningright  now.  This  is  a second reason to  expect a considerableexpansionary effects  of  interest  rates  and,  second, just  the beginningof  the  early stages  of  the  kicking  in  of  the  contractionary phase  ofmonetary policy.  As  I think Mike  indicated  in  answer  to somequestion, you  should just  now be  beginning  to  see  the  effects  of  theFed's  tightening in 1994.  It  is  very hard at  this point  to  see  it  inthe  tea  leaves, but  history suggests  that  it  is  right  around  thecorner.  So  those  are  two  fundamentals  leading me  to  think we  shouldhave  a sharp  deceleration  in  1995--the wearing  off of  the previousexpansion and  the  kicking  in  of  the  tightening.Finally, there  is  the  inventory swing.  I think  the  staffoutlook--I was  about  to  say  it  is  exactly right,  but nobody can  get  itexactly right.  Nobody knows  the  timing of  this, but  it  is  an awfullygood bet  that between  the  fourth quarter  of  1994  and  the  fourthquarter  of  1995,  the  inventory  swing  alone will  take  something between1/2  and a full  percentage point off  the growth  rate.  It  would bequite  surprising if  that didn't happen.  So  all  that points  to  aconsiderable  slowdown in  the  economy  even  if  there  is  no moretightening of monetary policy, and  somewhat more  if  there  is.  That  isas  close to  the  fence  as  I'm going to  come  right  now.Let  me  just  take  two minutes  on  inflation.  Many people  aresurprised,  and several people have  remarked around  this  table,  aboutthe  modest  rate  of  inflation given  the  rapid economic  growth.  I wantto  say  two  things about  that.  First,  this  is  not  quite as  surprisingas  people  seem to  think.  If  we have overshot  capacity, as  Mike said,we have overshot  very, very recently and by very, very modest  amounts.And there  are  long  lags.  It  would be  surprising  indeed  if  we already12/20/94-29-saw a  sharp  increase  in  inflation  from  that.  Simple  evidence, whichsays  the  same thing  in  a different  way,  is  that  the  conventionalPhillips  curves  are  fitting  this  episode extraordinarily well.  Theyhave very small  residuals.  So,  if  there  is  a new economy due  togreater  openness,  a  traumatized  labor  force, or  whatever--all  thesethings  are possible--the evidence  for  that  is  really not  in  the data.And so  I think  the  staff  is  wise  to  stay clear  of  it.  That  is,  itwould be  imprudent  for us  as  central  bankers  to  presume we are  in  anew,  substantially less  inflationary world.  On  the  other hand,  therecent  news  is  good:  To  the  extent  that  the errors  are  coming  in notquite  zero,  they are  coming  in  favorably.  And while we would beimprudent  to  jump hastily  to  a conclusion  that  we are  in a new world,we would be  foolish  to  ignore  the  evidence as  it  comes  in.  And theGreenbook doesn't  ignore  it.  They have written  down the  inflationforecast a bit  in  reaction  to  the  recent  data.  I  think that  is  aboutthe  right way  to  deal  with  it.Finally, a  last  remark  about  inflation and  in  defense  of  thestaff:  Standard econometric  estimates would  say  that  a  1 percentovershoot--1  percent  as  measured by the  unemployment  rate  for  anentire  year--would add about  1/2  percent  to  the  inflation  rate.  Now,it  is  correct  that  nobody  should take  these numbers  as  equivalent  tothe  gravitational  constant  in physics--never mind Einsteinianamendments  to  that.  We  don't  know these numbers  nearly  that  well.  Onthe  other hand, there  is  no particular  reason  to  think that  it  is  toolow rather  than too  high.  It  is  the  best  guess,  and  even  if  you wantto view that  0.5  percent  effect  as  saying  0.5  plus  or minus  2percentage  points, which  I  think would be  very much an  exaggeration ofthe  errors,  0.5  is  still  as  good a guess  as  you can make--except that,if  anything,  the  incoming  evidence seems  to be  pointing  to  a  littleless  of  an  inflationary impact,  not  a little more,  as  I said  a minuteago.  So,  the  evidence  is  not  overwhelming.  But,  if  anything,  itwould shade you  toward  less  of  an  inflationary acceleration, not more.So,  there,  I have  defended you!

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  My opinion concerning  the  strength and  likelyfuture direction  of  the  economy has  changed just  marginally  since ourlast  meeting.  Certainly,  the  evidence has  continued to  accumulatethat  we have  an  economy with a very  good head of  steam.  We  see  thatin  the  employment report,  a significant  rise  in  the help wanted  index,growing order backlogs,  and  frankly  to  my surprise  in the  Michiganindexes  of  car,  appliance, and house  buying  intentions  which allturned up  after having  fallen,  in  some  cases  substantially, ina  slowdown,  although I continue  to  feel--as  I  stated last  time--thatwe are  seeing  in part  the  lagged effects  of  a prolonged period of  lowinterest  rates,  as  Governor  Blinder also  noted.There  is  certainly some  risk  that real  growth will  slow  lessin  1995  than  the Greenbook  forecast  now assumes  and that we  couldovershoot potential  output  in  1995  by more.  Nevertheless,  I'll  justcontinue  to  emphasize,  as  others  and  I have  in  the past,  that  ourprevious  actions  have  added a great  deal  of restraint  to  the pipeline.Since our  last  meeting real  interest  rates have  risen  considerably,and as  Bill McDonough  emphasized, real  interest  rates by variousmeasures  are not  low by historical  standards.  We have  seen,  finally,12/20/94-30-a decline  in  the  stock market, which will  bring wealth effects  onconsumer spending  into play, and  for once  the  dollar has beenappreciating--which re-enforces  direct  interest  rate  effects  and playssome moderating  influence on  the  inflation  forecast.  In addition,  ofcourse, as  Mike has  emphasized,  inventory accumulation is  bound toslow and  it  seems  possible  to  me  that  accelerator mechanisms  can  thenkick  in  to  slow the  economy significantly.So,  I see a number of  changes  in  the pipeline  that  I expectto work  to  cool  off  demand but with a very substantial  lag.  Andfrankly at  this  stage  I remain  uncertain as  to  just  where the  economywould be  in  1996  with  the  100  to  150  basis points  increase that  isassumed  in the  Greenbook.  I share  the  concern  of  a number of privateforecasters  and of  some  of  you that  this  degree  of  tightening  in  thenear  term could slow demand growth  and  that we  could  end up producinga boom/bust  scenario.  To  avoid  such an  outcome,  it  seems  to me  thatthe  funds  rate  would have to  fall  rather quickly,  by more  than  theGreenbook assumes,  once  growth slows  to  trend, even  with the  economybelow the NAIRU.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Don?  If  not, why don't  Istart  as  usual?  I'm  impressed with the  extent  to which  it  is  verydifficult  to  find  any negative  factors  in  the  current  outlook.  Youcan not  find  it  in  the  order patterns, which  are strong  across  theboard.  There  are very few firms  outside  the  defense-related area orlong-term turkeys  that  are not  doing exceptionally well.  [Laughter]The  Christmas  selling  season  is,  as  always,  difficult  to  read.  Thetrouble with  the Christmas  selling  season  is  that  the  constant  dollarvolume  is  really predetermined because  retailers  will  sell what  theyhave  and  the  only thing  that  is  indeterminate  is  the price.  But  thatis  quite  relevant to  how  the  system works when you  get  into  the  firstquarter.  Looking strictly at  the  data as  they stand  at  this  stage,  itis  very difficult  to  tell  whether  in  this  quarter  the  GDP  growth rateis  3 percent  or  7 percent.  We  are making  forecasts  about  how thesystem  is  going  to  evolve.  My  own  impression  is  that  since  it  isextraordinarily unlikely that  all  of  these positive  events  willcontinue  without  change  for terribly  long,  one has  to  assume  that  thisexpansion will  start  to  ease  off  at  some point.  The  only thing  that  Ithink we have  to  be  careful  about  is  that  the  easing may be moredelayed  than  we suspect.  And until  we begin to  see  the process  oferosion  in  its  early  stages, we  really have no  basis  for  saying  thatthe  expansion  is  slowing  down.  We  are  looking at  history;  we arelooking at  relationships;  but  there are  no  significant demonstrableimbalances  in the  system that  basically  say things have  to  change.  Weare  projecting that  there  will  be  a  change,  but  that again  is  aprojection.  As  of  the moment  in  the  labor markets,  initial  claimscontinue  at  quite  low  levels.  The  fairly strong pattern  of  C&I  loanssuggests  that  inventory accumulation is  still  moving  at a  reasonably12/20/94-31-strong pace  and that  is  bolstered by  the  orders pattern, whichsuggests  that producers' durable goods  are  doing well.  Remember, agoodly part of  inventories  is  supported by the  capital goods  andconstruction markets  even though we don't  keep  the  data  that way.As  best  I can judge, profit margins  are still  on  the  firmside and even  though profit  forecasts  are beginning to  look moresymmetrical  rather  than just  continuously underestimated,  the  evidenceon  the profits  side  is  still  quite positive.  Prices,  as a lot  of youhave noted, are  firming in  the  commercial  real  estate markets,although my suspicion  is  that  the nationwide  figures may still  beeroding albeit at  a much  slower pace.  I won't add much  onhomebuilding;  it  is  a puzzle but  I think that  if  it  doesn't  start  tomove down,  then  all  of  our historical  relationships,  all  of  our basicdata, are  lacking  in predictive  value.  I don't believe  what  is  goingon  in homebuilding, but we  will  find out  eventually.I think the  interesting question is  why wages  are notresponding  to what  is  a very rapidly  tightening labor market.  Afterspeaking to  some  labor  leaders  and others who  talk  to  their membersand have  a sense of  this,  I get  the  impression that  long-term jobinsecurities  are quite pervasive  especially with respect  to  theportability of health  insurance and pensions that make workers  morecautious  about  changing jobs.  The layoff  rates  are very low;  theturnover  rates  are  really quite  low by American standards;  and thereis  a tendency among workers  just  to  stick with what  they have.  Theeffect  of  this,  I suspect,  is  a major factor  in holding wage  increasesto  a very sluggish pace  considering all  the  evidence we have beengetting  in recent months  of  labor market  tightness.  This  is  crucialbecause  so  long as  that  is  the  case and productivity  is  positive, unitcosts  are very well  contained.  Any endeavor  to  move  final  prices  upin  that environment  induces competitors  to  come  in and  try to  steal  afirm's  market  share,  which erodes  the  firm's pricing  capability.  Solong as  we have some  evident  flexibility  in  the  system, then pricescan not readily move.  This  doesn't necessarily mean  that  businessfirms  have  to  run out  of  capacity;  obviously, it  just  starts  to  get alittle more  costly or  a little  tight  and we begin to get pressures.But  it  is  not  clear from  the  anecdotal data  and  the macro data  that wehave  that  these pressures  are  severe.  I thought  that  the  exercisethat was  done for  the  Greenbook Part  II,  which separated where  thegrowth rates  have been  in manufacturing depending on which  industrieswere  at  high operating  rates,  is  tending  to  suggest  that there  is  moreflexibility  in  this  system than our  old conventional wisdom ofcapacity use  would indicate.  There  obviously has  to  be a limitsomewhere,  and when we  look back on  this we may well  find that we havea system that  is  a lot  more  flexible  than we presupposed.This  is  also  true,  I think, with respect  to  monetary policy.While  it  is  certainly  the  case  that we  have what  historically wouldhave been  a not  insubstantial  amount  of  a policy impact by  this  time,the  simulations  that  the  staff  has done,  including  the  fact  that  long-term interest  rates moved up  faster than  the normal process  wouldimply, suggest  that  we  are probably some  25  percent  into  thecumulative effects  of  our policy  tightening at  this  stage.  That  isnot  a small  number, and we  are now seeing very little effect  as  aconsequence.  On  the  contrary, what  we are  seeing  is  an easing  ofcredit  terms  in  the  banking sector  and the  old notion that we  used tohave  30-40  years ago--that  the  central bank would  tighten, short-term12/20/94-32-interest  rates  would rise, bank  credit would suddenly be crunched byRegulation  Q or  some  other  factor,  financing would be  undercut, andthe  economy would swoon--clearly is  an historic  relic  and  thedisintermediation  that we used  to  see  is  just  not  there.  On  thecontrary, we  are having difficulty getting banks  to  notice  thatinterest rates  are up.  The interest  rates  on  automobile  installmentpaper  are  really lagging.  Everybody  is  trying  to  protect marketshare, and  this  whole  thing just  doesn't  seem to  be  coming together.But  it  will.  It  always  does.  And the  question  is  essentially prettymuch when.I think it  is  really worth recognizing  that  there  issomething  quite different  about  the  timing  of  this  recovery.Ordinarily, a recovery has  a much  higher rate  of  growth  in  the  earlystages  and  slows  in  the  later  stages.  Probably what  is  happening hereis  that  we  really didn't  have  the  classic  movement  to  a cyclicalrecovery until well  into  the  cycle,  and we  are probably now  ateffectively the  earlier  stages  in a geriatric  sense as  distinct  fromthe  calendar.  What  this  suggests  is  that  we probably  still have quitesignificant momentum  in  the  system, and  it  is  not  clear  just when  itwill  ease  off.  I wonder to  what  extent we  can attribute  all  of  thisto  monetary policy and monetary policy lags.  Surely, we can  attributesome  of  it;  there  is  no  question  that  that  is  the  case.  But  there  isan  internal  dynamic  in  the  economy  that  is  wholly independent  of  thebusiness  cycle.  I do  think  the  issue  that Jerry Jordan  raised  is  aninteresting  one,  and even  though  it  is  very difficult  to  provestatistically,  it may well be  that  the  fact  that  inflation  isrelatively low may--despite all  the  discussions we have  had about  theinadequacy of  the  evidence--be contributing  to  improved productivity.If  that  is  the  case, we will  get  some greater growth  in potential.  Ihope  that  one  of  these days  I will  be  able  to  use  one  of  thesestatistics  after  the  fact,  and  finally say  I told you  so  [Laughter])without  struggling.  I must  say I'm a  little  concerned about  thecontinued ease  in bank lending terms  which  I suspect  is  greater  thanthe  numbers  show.I seriously wonder  what our monetary actions  from here  onwill  do  to  1995  as  well  as  to  1996.  I think  it  is  true,  as  a numberof  you have  pointed out,  that  if  we  really look  at  the  distributedlags--the  average performance historically  of monetary policy--it  isvery difficult  to  make  the  case  that  what we may do  in the  earlymonths  of  1995  will have  significant  effects  in  calendar  1995  in  realterms.  I would only caution  that  if  we  get  an  unexpected breakout  onthe  up  side  in  inflationary expectations,  the  distributed  lag  ofmonetary policy will bunch up  very quickly.  We have  to  be  carefulabout  that.  I do  think  the argument  that most  of  the  impact  isdelayed is  clearly a correct view, but  I  think we  have to  be carefulabout  the probability--even  though  it  is  low--of  significantaberrations  that  could have  important  negative  effects.All  in all,  if  we decided that  we needed  to  move  the  fundsrate  up  at  this  meeting, which  I don't  support  I must  say, I doubtvery much that  that would have  a negative  effect  on  economic activity.I think the  economy's  momentum is  still  quite  strong.  I do worry,however, with  or without the  Orange  County turmoil  and  the  usual  end-of-year problems,  whether we  would be  taking undue  risks  inendeavoring  to tighten  in this  environment.  I think  that  the  oddsthat  we  are  going  to  have to  move  shortly after  the  first  of  the year,12/20/94-33-no  later  than  our next  meeting, are  quite high.  However, it  isconceivable  that  this  expansion could  fizzle  out  fairly  quickly.  Ifrankly don't  expect  that,  but  I think we  can't disregard  thatpossibility.  Where  I would  come  out  at  this  stage is  that  I hope  wewill be  comfortable  staying where we are  for a while.  I believe,  asDon  Kohn pointed out,  that we have  time  to  make  further  adjustments  ifneed be, but  because of  the possibility that  we might  find  itnecessary to  move after  the  first  of  the  year but  before  January 31,  Ithink  it  would be preferable to  have  an asymmetric  directive.  ViceChairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  yourconclusion  that  alternative  B with an  asymmetric directive  isappropriate.  As  I remarked earlier,  the degree  of  uncertainty aboutthe  effect of  existing monetary policy suggests waiting.  Also,  thesuggested we  could have  some  remaining  effect  of  governmental  actionson Bankers  Trust, which would create  some  uncertainty in markets.Therefore,  I think that  to  make a move  that  is  not absolutelynecessary right at  this  time  involves  some degree  of  risk.  It  isdifficult  to  quantify and would be  better  if  we avoided  it.  Whyasymmetric?  We  get  enough  data  in the  first half  of  the month--nonfarm payroll  employment  on the  6th of  January, retail  sales  on  the13th,  and  industrial production on  the  17th--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Industrial  production we  get muchearlier.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  We do?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  it  is  a Federal  Reserve number!

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  The world  gets  it  later.  In anycase,  I think what  is  important  is  not  so much what we  know but whatis  known  outside.  It  might  very well  be  the  case  that  by the middleof  the  month, roughly, our  strong views  on price stability  could bequestioned.  And, therefore, we  should have the  capability of  moving.We  can move  in  fact without  an  asymmetric  directive, but  I think  thatwe  are better  off with  the  asymmetric  directive  toward tightening.Therefore,  I believe  that  the  combination  of  doing nothing  today withan  asymmetric directive  toward tightening  is  the  appropriate  mix.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mr.  Chairman, one  argument  against  policy movesat  this  time  is  this  skittishness  of  the markets  on  the heels  of  theOrange County mess.  On  the  contrary, I  think the  markets  have  reactedto  the  "Lemon" County and  the  Bankers  Trust  situations  with greatpoise  and restraint.  In my opinion,  the markets  may be  more dismayedby a  lack  of  further  tightening now, particularly as  they sense  theincreased  level  of  economic  activity,  the  shrinking  labor  marketslack, high  levels of  capacity  utilization, and consumer  attitudesthat don't  foretell much  slowing of  consumption.  In  the past,  therehas  been market  speculation  that we  were behind the  curve.  Thethe  continued strength of  economic  activity even  temporarily mayreignite  concerns  about  our determination.  At the  risk of  dubbing  theFed  as  the  Grinch who  stole Christmas,  it  seems  to  me we  need  to  snub12/20/94-34-the  brakes  again without  delay,  and  therefore  I would preferalternative C  symmetric.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I  favor  "B" asymmetric  towardtightening.  As  I mentioned before,  the  response of  the  financialaggregates  convinces me  that  we can  afford  to  do  nothing now andobserve  the  effects  of  our prior actions  for  a time.  I must  say,though,  that  I'm not  at  all  convinced  that  we  have  fully met  thecurrent challenge  especially  if  our  goal,  as  I think  it  should be,  isprice stability.  Therefore,  I think  it  is  important  that we giveserious  consideration  at  the  February meeting as  to  how we mightconvey our  long-term  intentions  in  this  regard.  The question  that wehad  from  Senator Riegle  last  July was  indicative,  I think, of  the  factthat perhaps  on  the  outside  there was  some  confusion as  to exactlywhat we  intended.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There  has been  some discussion  that  thenew Congress  would  establish  such  a  legislative goal.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Yes.  With  regard  to  that  issue, perhaps  onething we  ought to  think about  would be  to  provide  some  longer-runinflation  forecasts,  say beyond  1995  or  1996,  because,  as  an  initialstep  in  considering  legislation, I  think one  could  say  that  monetarypolicy  is  going  to  have  its principal  long-term  impact  on  inflation.Eventually, I would be  inclined  to  establish  long-run inflation  orprice  level  objectives  as  some  other  central banks  have done.  Nowclearly this  is  going  to  require  a  lot  of  further  work, and  I'mencouraged by  the  fact  that  the  staff  is  looking  into  that  issue.  Iwould hope  that  we might  have something,  at  least  to  start  on, that  wecould  talk  about at  the  February meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree  that  this  isa good time  for waiting.  It  was  only 35  days  ago  that we  raised  thefed  funds  rate by what was  essentially  a record amount.  The Augustinterest  rate  increase was  only three  months before  that,  and by allhistorical  standards  ought  not  to  be  showing  in  the  data  as  yet.  Thatis  to  say,  125  of  the  250  basis  points  of  tightening  that we have  doneup  to  now  could not possibly be  in  the  data at  this  point.  I think  ifwe  were  to  move now  it  would  imply  some  sense  of  alarm on  our part,some  sense  of  urgency  that  things were  going badly wrong.  And  likeyou,  I don't  think  things  are going badly wrong.  Things  are  lookingpretty good.  Even the next  FOMC meeting comes  just  11  weeks  after  thea quarter?  It  is,  of  course,  the magic number  for  a macro  economistwho  tends  to  look at  the  economy every quarter.  It  is  a  shame  therewasn't more  spacing  in  there, but  that  is  the  way the  FOMC  calendarfalls.  So,  I think you are almost  surely right  that  it  is  wise towait until  the  next  FOMC meeting unless  something  fairly  startlinghappens.  In  that  regard,  I would prefer  a symmetric  directive.  Idon't  feel  strongly  enough about  this  to  make  a big  deal  of  it,  but  Ihave  a predisposition to  wait  until  the  next  FOMC meeting  for a numberof  reasons.  I wasn't persuaded by  Bill's  argument  that  if  these  datathat  he  mentioned come  in  strongly that  we might  not wish  to wait what12/20/94-35-basically amounts  to  only two more weeks.  If  the Greenbook  forecastwithout  the  additional  tightening is,  say,  2.1 percent  real  growth  in1995,  which we were discussing before,  it  is  not  so  obvious  that  weought  to  take action  to push  it  down  lower  than that.  As  I saidbefore,  I suspect  that  the projection  might be  a  little on  the  lowside;  that  without more  tightening growth  in  1995 might  be  higher thanthat;  and indeed  that  more  tightening might be  necessary.  I for  onehave  an  open mind about  future increases  in  short  rates.Finally,  I won't  repeat my  thermostat speech  of  the  lasttime, but  I always  keep  in  mind that  the  classic  mistake  of  centralbanks  in  almost  all  times  and almost  all  countries  is  to  overstayeither  their  tightening or  their easing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  As  we all  know, the  Greenbook  is  assuming  thatthe  funds  rate  has  to  be pushed up  another percentage point  or perhapseven more  to  keep  inflation  from breaking  out.  Obviously, we can'tknow for  sure  at  this  stage whether  that much  tightening  is  going tobe  needed, and  indeed as  you suggested, Mr.  Chairman,  things may workout  so  that  nothing more  is  needed.  Still--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  a very  low probability.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I would  think so,  and  I think  it  is  certainlya very high probability that  we are going to  have  to  do  somethingmore.  The  question before  us  this  morning  is  whether or not we needto do  some  of  that  tightening today  or whether we  can put  it  off  alittle  longer.  I think  it  is  a very close  call.  My own preference  atthis  meeting would be  to  move  the  funds  rate  up  1/4  percentage pointto  5-3/4  percent.  I realize  the  1/4  point  funds rate moves  earlier  inthe  year had adverse  reactions,  and  at  that  time  some  argued thatthose moves  were made under  sensitive  circumstances.  However,  thesituation  is  very different  now.  We  only recently made  a very strongmove,  so  I don't  think  that  kind of  reaction would be  a problem atthis  stage  of  the  game.  I think  the main argument  for  a relativelymodest  further  move  today  is  that  it  would reinforce  and lock  in  thequite  considerable credibility gains  that  the  November tighteningappears  to  have produced, as  I believe John LaWare  suggested.  I thinksome  reinforcement  at  this  stage would be  desirable given  the  verystrong recent  data on both  employment and  spending.  At  the  same  time,a  1/4  point move would be  significantly more  restrained than  any ofour  last  three moves,  and  it  would indicate  that  we  recognize  the  needfor  caution  as  we move  closer  to  the  cyclical  peak.  So,  my preferencewould be  for  a 1/4  percent  increase.  I also would  like  to  second TomMelzer's comments  about  the need  to  consider some  sort  of  inflationtarget,  something  to  nail  down our  longer-term goals  and objectives  atthe  February meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman, I would agree with those  who  saythat  we need to  take  some  action at  some  point.  I  think that  thatshould be  now, not  later.  The  best  environment  is  to  do  it  now whilesensitive  to  market  concerns.  I happen  to  think Governor LaWare  iscorrect.  By delaying we would risk having  to  do more  later  and  havingmore  adverse effects,  so  I would prefer  doing  something now.12/20/94-36-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I think  the main part  of  our problem right  nowis  inflation  psychology.  It  certainly reflects  the  lack  of  a nominalanchor.  It  suggests that  it would be  helpful  to  have a politicallysupported mandate  to  attain and maintain a stable value of  the  dollar.If  somehow we could achieve  the  conditions of  a true gold  standard--without gold but  the  steady purchasing power  of  money in the  minds  ofpeople--over  time  it  would make  some of  these  short-term things  thatwe  go  through a lot  easier  to  deal  with.  I also  support  Tom Melzer'ssuggestion about  having  a discussion but  also  having a long-termfocus.  That  may sound like  a minor change but  one  that may beimportant  in  a communications  sense because  our  long-term forecastsare often  taken  as  long-term  inflation  objectives.  I still  feel  thatthe  numbers we put  together for  the Humphrey-Hawkins  process  shouldnot be people's predictions  of  what  is  going  to  happen with regard toinflation, but  rather  a reflection of  what  we  intend to  try andachieve by  our monetary policy  actions.There is  some  good news  about what  seems  to be a consensusaround the  table that  the  rates of  change  of  output  and employmentthis year  are  unsustainable.  And as  somebody said, unsustainablethings  have  a habit of  ending.  The question  is  whether  it  will  end asa result of  a natural process  in  which whatever dynamics produced itin  the  first place  start  to  diminish so we  get  a deceleration  in  therate  of  change  toward  something  that's more  consistent with  trend.  Oris  it  something  that we have  to  take conscious  policy actions  to  forceif  it  is  not  occurring naturally?  I would resist  the  latter.  To  theextent  that  the  anticipated slowing  in  the  growth  of activity  issupposed  to  occur because  of  reductions  in  capital expenditures  forproductivity-enhancing or  capacity-increasing purposes,  it  is  not  tobe welcomed.  It  is  implausible  to  me  that  investing  less  in  capacityand productivity  lessens  the  chance of  inflation.  In  fact,  quite thecontrary;  we  should welcome having more people  invest  in capitalexpenditure programs  for capacity or productivity.  So  if  you're  goingto  contemplate  an  action before  the next  meeting, with or without  anasymmetric  directive, with  or without a telephone  call,  I hope thatthe numbers  will be  reviewed very  carefully to  determine whether whatwe are  seeing is  a result of  still  diminished head winds and theeconomy has a ways  to  go  in a natural  spontaneous process  versussomething that  is  read  in  the marketplace  as  a spillover  of  excessdemand.  And that  is  going to  happen  if  it  isn't  carefully done.  Iwouldn't  dissent  against  an asymmetric  directive, but  I would be veryconcerned  if  any action taken was  interpreted  in  the marketplace  asanti-growth  for  the  sake  of  it.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Jerry,  just to  clarify, I favor your  objectiveas  well, but  recognizing  the  practicalities of  getting  from where weare  to  that  in a relatively short period  of  time and the possibilityof  a legislative mandate, I was  suggesting  that  a long-term forecastI agree with you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I want  to  associate myself  fully with GovernorBlinder's  views.  My reasoning  is  similar.  The  first  observation  isthat  I think the November move was  extremely  successful.  Our decisionto  go  75  basis points  took off  the market pressure  in both  the  foreignexchange market  and the  bond market.  I think had we moved  50  basispoints, we  would be moving  another  50  basis points  today.  So  in thatsense we  should be  patting ourselves  on  the back  for our  last  move.And as  a result  I don't  think we should  move right  now.I have  four  reasons  for not  preferring an  asymmetricdirective.  The  first has  to  do with data.  Reporters  often askwhether we  are waiting  for  information  from  the  Christmas  season  toabsolutely nothing  that  we  are going  to  do  at  this  meeting  that  couldconceivably affect  the  Christmas  season  or vice  versa.  In  fact,  asour  discussion about  lags  has  indicated, what we are  talking  about  isnot  even  the  first  quarter;  what we  are talking  about  is  late  1995  andearly 1996  with regard to  the  effect of  our  actions.  So,  rather  thanlooking at current  activity we have  to  use  our crystal  balls,  whichadmittedly are  cloudy, and  stare down the  road.  So,  I'm not  sure whatinformation  is  going  to  come  out  in January  to  cause us  to  change  ourminds.On  the  other hand,  I do  think  that  over  the  longer period weare going  to  have  information  that  will  be  useful.  We will  have moreinformation  on where  fiscal policy  is  headed and  sooner  than weusually do.  In  addition,  we are going  to  have  information  on  theconsumer.  I think the  anecdotal  evidence on  the  consumer  situation,as  Governor  Kelley suggested,  is  that  they appear  to  be  tapped  out.In  fact,  when you  talk  to bankers,  they  are now  issuing credit  cardsto  C and  D class  credits,  and  they are  doing so profitably.  I'msaving  this  for  the next meeting,'but when I look  at  the  cash  flowsituation  of  households,  the  only private  sector  support  for thisspending  in my mind is  a buildup  of  consumer  credit.  I think thecredit  data  bear that  out.  So,  I would  rather delay for  informationreasons--certainly not move  in January,  and  I may even want  to  delayat  our next  meeting  on January  31-February  1.The other  issues have  to  do with our  tactics  in  the market.We have  learned  this  year that moving  at meetings  gives us  a much moreefficient  tradeoff measured by the  short-term move  compared to  thelong-term move.  Generally, we have had  flat  or  rallying markets  onmoves at  meetings.  We have  been unsuccessful when we movedintermeeting, and  I think  that  is  another reason  not  to  go  asymmetricand  not  to move  intermeeting.Finally, and  I think  this  reinforces  President  Melzer'spoint, we will  have  to  consider  our  long-term  intentions  at  our nextmeeting and we  will  be making not  only a tactical  move  but a  strategicmove.  And I think we  should at  the  very least  want  to  hold whatevertactical moves  we have  until we  know where  we  are  going  to  go12/20/94-38-strategically.  So  for  those reasons  I concur  with Mr.  Blinder andurge  symmetric  "B."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  in my view the  economy  has pickedup more momentum since  our last  meeting, and  the  degree of  tightnessin  labor and product  markets  has  risen  even  further.  Our analysisagrees  with the Greenbook  that  further  tightening  is  needed in  orderto  prevent an  increase  in  the  inflation  trend.  Therefore,  I wouldprefer  a  50  basis point  increase in  the  funds  rate.  Frankly,  I don'tsee  the problems  of  Orange  County as  a  reason to  hesitate  in doingwhat  is  best  at  this  point  for  the  national  economy.  Financialfutures  markets  expect a  50  basis  point  increase  in  the  funds  rate  byearly January.  Thus,  I doubt  that  a policy move at  this  time  wouldcause much disruption.  However,  I can  support  your recommendationsince  I interpret your comments  as  indicating that  a change  in  policyis  quite  likely by roughly the  middle  of January.  If  the  tone  of  theeconomic  data does not  change,  I am concerned that  further  delaybeyond that point  would lead  to  a deterioration of  inflationaryexpectations.

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman, we believe that  further tighteningis  almost  inevitable  because  of  the  unexpectedly rapid pace of  theexpansion and  the  prospect  of unsustainably robust growth  continuingin  the  future.  However,  in light  of  the  unusually  large  action at  thebeing, with  the  expectation  that  economic developments  in  the  comingweeks  will  confirm the  need for  an  increase  in  the  funds  rate  at  theasymmetric directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think that  the  case  for notmoving  today  is  quite persuasive.  We  did move aggressively  just  a fewweeks  ago  and  I think we  have moved aggressively throughout  the year.The cumulative moves  are  really quite  significant.  We need toremember the  lags  in  monetary policy and  give  some  time  for  that  towork  through  the  pipeline.  In  fact,  I am not  convinced  that  any greatfurther  degree  of  tightening  is  necessary, but  I have  an open mind onthat  score.  Also,  as  I tried  to  indicate before,  I think  there  is  nowgreater  flexibility  in  the  economy.  At  the  risk  of  belaboring thatpoint,  I think  there  is  a plausible argument  that would suggest  thatthe  economy can  support  a greater degree  of  growth  at  the present  timewithout  incurring  inflationary pressures.  Obviously,  this  is  moretheory and  argument  than anything  else,  and as  has  been pointed outthis  morning  there  is  really  not very much empirical  evidence.  Someof  the  things  that  you  cited with respect to  the  labor market  I thinkare  appropriate  and relevant  here,  so  the burden  of  proof  obviously  ison  those  who  would suggest  that  this  is  a plausible  theory, and  Ithink there  is  a risk  in  using it  in  terms  of  policy deliberation.However,  I do  think  it  is  important  to  keep  this  in mind as  we goforward because  if  this  is  in  fact  the  case  we run a  risk on  the  otherside  of  seriously overdoing monetary policy actions.  For  the  moment,12/20/94-39-I would support  your recommendation.  I would prefer a  symmetricdirective, but  I could  support  the  asymmetric  option as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman, in appreciation  for  GovernorBlinder not  giving his  thermostat  speech  I'll  forego  giving myinflationary teakettle  speech!  [Laughter]  But  I do  think that  giventhe momentum  that  we observe  that  it  is  overwhelmingly likely that  weare  going  to  need to go  up  at  least  some more;  and  it  does  seem to  methat  once  one  becomes  convinced of  that,  then  it  is  desirable  to  do  itquite  soon in  the  expectation  that  that  is  the best  way to head offhaving to  do  too much.  That  said, I think  it  certainly would be  agood idea  to  hold off  until  after  the year-end pressures.  At  thatpoint,  we ought  to  take  another very hard look  at  it.  For  today, Icertainly  support  your  "B" asymmetric  approach.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I also would support  "B" asymmetric.  I thinkthat we have  more tightening to  go,  but  I'm willing to wait  untilearly next year.  As  a general  matter, I agree with Governor Kelley--if  you  are  going  to  do  it,  earlier  is  better.  But  I think we havebeen given  some breathing  room with the  favorable  CPI  numbers.  Itwould be useful  to  let  us  get past  the  end of  the year and  the  year-end marking-to-market.  That  allows  the markets  a chance  to  settleout.  Ultimately, I think  that  more  tightening is  going  to benecessary.  With all  of  the market  and monetary restructuring  that  hastaken place,  it  is  probably  going  to  take  larger  swings  in  interestrates  to  achieve monetary goals.  It  is  very difficult  to  generalizefrom past experience when  the pipeline  is  going  to  kick in  fully.  Iwould  like  to  see  us  give  serious  consideration  to  the  longer-terminflation  targeting approach  that  a number  of  people have  spokenabout;  Tom Melzer  started  off  the discussion  of  it  today.  But  fortoday,  I think  "B" asymmetric will  serve  us  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I favor  alternative B  to  hold thefunds  rate  at  5-1/2  percent  at  this  meeting, and  I favor  it  for  thereasons  suggested in  the  Bluebook.  I also  concur with the  sentimentsexpressed by Governors  Blinder  and Lindsey and  President Forrestal.  Ithink a wait-and-see  strategy is  reasonable,  given  the magnitude ofprevious  tightening  and particularly given our uncertainty  aboutwhether  and how much the  economy  is  likely  to  slow on  its  own  and myown uncertainty about  how much additional  tightening  is  going to  beneeded.  I would prefer a  symmetric  directive  with a strongpresumption that  we would wait  until  the  next  meeting in  order  to  act.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I agree with your proposal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I'd favor  "B" with a  symmetric  directive.  Ifavor  "B"  because  I do  think we  have  applied some  restraint  and,given  the  lags,  I think we  ought  to  be patient and  take  some  time  to12/20/94-40-see  what  effects,  if  any, they  have.  I favor a symmetric  directivefor  several reasons.  Part of  it  is  my normal antipathy  to,  ordiscomfort with,  asymmetric directives.  But more  fundamentally onthis  occasion,  I have  trouble  imagining what  evidence we will get  inthe  next  several weeks  that  is  really going  to  help us  address  what  Iconsider  to be one  of  the  key questions:  What  is  the  economy going  tobe  like  and what  is  the  appropriate  stance or  policy actions  that  willinfluence  things  later in  1995  and into  1996?  It  just  doesn't  seemlikely to me  that we  are going to  learn  anything in the next  severalweeks  that  is  going to  help us  very much  in addressing thosequestions.  I may be wrong, but we  can have  a conference call  ifsignificant new information  does materialize.  Beyond  that,  thesuggestion has  been made,  and I certainly agree with it,  that  thereare  a number  of  fundamental  longer-run policy  issues  that  theCommittee  should discuss  and perhaps  try to  reach  consensus on.  Inoted a number  of  them  in my recent  communication.  [Secretary's  note:A copy of  Mr. Stern's  letter  to  Chairman Greenspan, dated November 29,1994,  is  appended.]  And I think the  one  that  is  on  the  table  alreadyabout  longer-run  inflation objectives  is  a good place  to  start.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Just  to  clarify:  One  of  the  events  thatis  not  irrelevant is  how the  markets respond  to  what's  happening.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And  I think that  that  is  probably themost crucial  "statistic"  in a sense  and really the  only one  that  couldmake a material difference  in  this period.  I agree  it  is  very hard  tofind data with anything crucial.  But  I think that  there  is  a veryimportant  issue  here, namely  that we not  allow our  an  erosion in  ourcredibility that we have built  up and which has  kept  the  cap on  long-term  interest  rates.  I must  tell you,  it  is  too  subtle an issue  forany of  us  to  predict.  Let's  get  to  President  Minehan  and then  I havea few  things  I'd like  to  say about  this  issue.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I have  been  concerned for  some  time  about  thethermostat  issue  that  Governor Blinder raised.  We did quite  a littlework prior  to  this  meeting to  assure ourselves  that at  least as  far  aswe  could project, however  deficient  that projection might be,  that  theamount of  tightening  that  is  already in  the pipeline  is  notsufficient.  We  came  out pretty strongly, all  of  us  in Boston, withthe  conclusion that  it  is  not  sufficient.  So  for us,  it  is  not  aquestion of  "whether;" it  is  a question of  "when."  I would alignmyself with the  people who think  that  if  it  is  not  a question ofwhether but a question of  when, that  sooner  is better  than  later.  Inthat  area  I would align myself with Governor  LaWare's remarks.  DonKohn  talked about  the markets  being fairly confident,  but  I think itis  important  to  remember  that what  the market  giveth  the  market  cantake away, too.  And along  the  lines  of what you said, Mr.  Chairman,  Itoo would be  concerned  that we might  lose  the  credibility that hasbeen hard won.  I view the  75  basis points  we did at  the  last meetingin  two ways:  as  a 50 basis  point make-up  for  actions  that  I think weshould have  taken earlier,  and as  25  basis points  into  what we neededto  do  at  that meeting.  So,  I don't really regard that  move as beingas  strong as  some  other people do.  All  of  that  said,  I'm verycognizant  of  the probability that people  who are  closer to  the  marketsthan we  are in  Boston have  a view of  the  thin  trading  and whateverthat  is perhaps better  taken  than ours.  So  I'd be willing  to go  "B,"12/20/94-41-but  I'd feel  fairly  strongly that  asymmetric  should be  the  tonebecause I am  concerned that we might  see  market movements, given  thestrength of  the  underlying economic  data.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  is  an  interesting result  we  aregetting.  It  is very clear  that  there  is  a heavy consensus  for  "B."However,  there  is  a very sharp  split  on  symmetric versus  asymmetricunless  we  take  the  two members  who have argued  for  an  increase asbeing  on the  asymmetric  side--but we  don't usually do  it  that way.What  I would  like  to do,  though,  is  more pro  forma and that  is  tosuggest  the  following as  probably an appropriate  way to  come  at  this.We  are,  as  I think a number of  us have discussed,  in a crucial  area  asto how we  should behave.  Given  the discussion  that  we have had  aroundthis  table,  I don't  think  it  would be wise  to move before  the nextmeeting without a  conference call  to  be  certain that  everyone  has asay with respect  to  how they view what we are dealing with.  I  franklydon't  know whether or not  such  a call  will be  appropriate;  it  may wellbe very clear  during the  period  that  it  is  not.  But  I don't  think weought  to  move  in  the  intermeeting period without having had aCommittee  discussion.  I would like  to  stay with the  asymmetricdirective with  "B" because  it  captures,  marginally  as I read it,  theview of  the Committee.  But  it  is  pro  forma and  I would suggest  thatthe  difference  frankly between  symmetric and  asymmetric,  as  far  asaction  is  concerned, probably  is  minuscule.  So,  I would like  to  put"B"  asymmetric on  the  table  for  a vote.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I am reading  from page  14  of  the  Bluebook:  "Inthe  implementation  of  policy  for  the  immediate  future,  the  Committeeseeks  to maintain  the  existing  degree  of pressure  on  reservepositions.  In  the  context of  the Committee's  long-run  objectives  forprice stability and  sustainable economic  growth, and giving  carefulconsideration  to  economic,  financial,  and monetary developments,somewhat  greater reserve  restraint would  or  slightly lesser  reserverestraint might be  acceptable  in the  intermeeting period.  Thecontemplated reserve  conditions are  expected  to  be consistent withmodest  growth  in M2  and M3  over  coming months."

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Somewhat  and  slightly?  You  said  somewhat moreand  slightly  less?
