SPEAKER(?).  So  moved.

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection.  There's  a short  reporton  foreign  currency operations.  There weren't many operations.

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  I've  had to  suffer  a lot  of  comments  on  that![Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any  comments or  questions?

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  What  was  the  second occasion when you consideredintervention?

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  It was  an occasion when  the  dollar was  moving upvery rapidly  toward the  2.30  to  2.32  level.  It  occurred at  a timewhen questions were being  raised about  the German  situation after  theChancellor's  health problems  and after some money  figures  here hadsuggested that  interest  rates might be  required to  go  up again at  thatpoint.  The  dollar spurted up  from about  2.28  to  2.32  and that  causeda considerable  amount  of  consternation.  But  [the  advance]  lasted onlya matter of  hours  and the  dollar then began to  retreat.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  There  was no one  particular event  except  theChancellor's  health?

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  I don't  think the  rise  could be  associated with asingle  event  at  that point;  it  was  certainly not  comparable  to  theassassination of  President  Sadat.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You have a recommendation  for us?

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  Yes  I do,  Mr. Chairman.  All  of  our swaparrangements will  be  coming up  for  renewal  before the  end of  the  year,and I would request  the Committee's  approval  to  roll  them  over  foranother year  in  the  normal way.  Since  last year  [there  have beenchanges]  in  three cases.  The central  banks of  England, Canada, andMexico have  specified  the  investments  against  which the  interest ratesshould be  calculated in  the  event  that  the  Federal  Reserve were todraw on those  swaps.  For  good order we  would propose  that  the  changein the  arrangements with these  three central  banks be  incorporated  inthe  language  at  the  time we  renew them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are we  symmetrical  in  all  these now  interms  of  that?

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  Well,  symmetrical--11/17/81

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  change was made  last  year  for  all  the  caseswhere we would draw at  the  foreign  rate.  When we  did  it  for  theGermans, we did  it  for all  of  them.  The problem was  that  not all  thecountries  were  ready  to  come  forward with a rate at  that  time,  so  theswaps  for  those cases  were  rewritten  to  say  "an appropriate domesticrate"  which  in  our  case--

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  And these  three  do  not  correct  all  of  them.There are  still  some  in  that unspecified category.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  We had a  long negotiation, youremember, with  the Japanese;  it was  not  so  long with  the  Germans.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  there's  a question  of  the  interestrate.  There's  also  a question of  the  exchange  rate,  which I nowforget--

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Well,  that  was eliminated, too.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The exchange  rate was  different when  oneside  was drawing than when the  other side  was  drawing.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  That has  all  been put on  a symmetrical  basis.On  the  one hand,  it's  on a symmetrical  basis;  on  the  other hand, theinterest rate was  adjusted at  the  same  time.

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  Some  of  them are  not  specified.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Our biggest problem with  theJapanese, which we  finally solved, was not getting a market  ratebecause  their Treasury bill  rate was worked that  out.  I had  to put  a lot  of  pressure  on the  Ministry ofFinance  as  well  as  on  the Bank  of  Japan.  There  are  two differentversions;  but  they're  completely satisfied now with  the arrangementsover at  the Treasury.But we  finally

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, we  seem to be  in  reasonable shape  onthese  arrangements  regarding  the  terms.  Do we have  a motion?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Mr. Chairman,  I think you're  remembering therisk-sharing,  and that  is  what  was dropped  in all  the  cases.  Thesubstitution that was made was  that  we would at  the  same  time  take--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm remembering the  risk-sharing.  I don'tremember  the  specifics  of  it  at  this  point, but  I won't--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  For the  five  that we  had drawn upon in  the  post-1973  period, they  had a provision  that  they would share  the  risk  onour  drawing.  That was  the--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  50-50.  Well,  do we  have  motion?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  So moved.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Second.11/17/81

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  I hear no  objections,  you areauthorized to negotiate  these on  substantially the  same  terms  as  theynow exist.

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Sternlight.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Statement--see Appendix.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Questions  or  comments?

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  Peter, at  these meetings weset  desired rates  of  growth  for M-1B.  In  the  last  7 or  8 months  [M1-Bgrowth has  been]  significantly below the  lower end of  the  targetranges  that we've  set.  As  I listened  to you,  I got  the  impressionthat  one  of  the  reasons  for  that  is  that borrowings,  as  they  actuallyevolved, were at  a lower  level  than  the assumptions  we had made at  ourmeetings.  Under our  procedures, when borrowings are below what weanticipate  they will  be, do you  adjust  the  nonborrowed path or  thetotal  reserve  objective  to  compensate  for that  reduced  level  ofborrowing?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  The decline  in  borrowings  over  the past  sixmonths  was a consequence  of  the  lower-than-path money growth.  Moneygrew less  than was  targeted,  [but  the target]  was  the  basis  forsetting path patterns  for  total  and nonborrowed reserves.  Inparticular we pretty much stuck with  our path for  nonborrowed reservesas money grew more  slowly and the  banking system needed less  reserves.Because  of  that  slower money growth borrowing came down,  and  that hasbeen  reflected in  a considerable decline  in rates.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Well,  I was  under  the  impression  that  we settargets  and then we do whatever we  think  is  [necessary]  to  achieve  theM1-B  target,  for  example.  So,  if  money  growth  is  coming  in  below, andif  borrowing comes  in below, don't we  take  some action to  counter  thatsituation  so  that we  can achieve  the  target that  we've  set  forourselves?  It  seems  to  me  that  if  we  adjusted upward the  nonborrowedreserve path, we'd get  total  reserves  at a higher  level  and therebywe'd be able  to  achieve,  or  at  least  come closer  to  achieving, ourM1-B  targets.  Or am I  [wrong]?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  there  have been adjustments  of  thatkind.  There have been  adjustments  in  the other direction when moneygrowth ran way ahead of  desires.  There was  a small  adjustment  of  thenature that  you've described within  this  last period;  the  nonborrowedpath was  raised because we were  falling below in money growth as  theperiod unfolded.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  But  as  I listened to your report,  I got  theimpression  that these  adjustments  were  very small  and  slight.  Whyaren't they made  to  the extent  necessary to  achieve  the  targets  thatwe  set?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  President Roos,  the  Committee  also had an  M2constraint.11/17/81

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Well,  had we adjusted nonborrowed reserves  toachieve  our M1-B--.  Let me put  it  differently.  You're  suggestingthat  we did  not  respond  as  might have  been necessary  to  achieve  ourM1-B  target because we would  have  overshot  the M2  target?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  If  the Committee  had only  an M1-B  target  andwas  determined to  achieve  it  no  matter what was  happening  to  M2  oranything else,  then,  of  course, we  would have had  to  push reserves  inand raise the  nonborrowed reserves path enormously, with  a resultingdrop  in  interest  rates  and presumably more marked expansion  in M2  andother  things.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  So,  Steve, we're almost  back  to  where  we were whenwe had  incompatibility of  achieving  interest  rate  targets  andaggregate  targets.  Now we  have  two  aggregate  targets  that  sometimesare  incompatible.  Is  that what  you're  saying?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  yes,  in  some  sense  maybe  they areincompatible.  You  can choose  one or  the  other;  you can't  choose  themboth.  But  given  the  [recent]  changes  in  financial  technology and theway people  are  behaving, the  Committee  inevitably has  to make  thejudgments  it  has  been making:  That  it's  going  to  take  this  attitudetoward  one  in  case  the  other  goes  off  and vice  versa.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Could we set  those,  if  we really wanted  to,  andlock  the  doors?  Could we  set  those two  aggregate targets  so  that  theywould be  compatible so you  could accomplish both  of  them?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Only  if  God were  sitting  at  this  table!  Let metell  you, it'd be--

MR. ROOS.  It  depends  on whether you're  a smoker  or  a non-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Black.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Steve,  do you believe pretty  confidently that  ifrates  had  come down  M2 would have  speeded up in view of  the  ratesensitivity that's  so  much  in  [evidence]  now?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  in  the  short  run our  experience  is  that[growth in]  money market  funds  tends  to  speed up  with rate  declinesbecause  of  the  lag in  [the  adjustment  of]  their  rates.  As  ratessavings  deposits  at  banks  accelerated.  I assume  it  was  just  some  sortof  cautionary  inflow.  But  all  the evidence  we  have  is  that,  yes,  asrates  decline we still  tend  to  see growth  in M2  as deposits  become  alittle more attractive relatively speaking.  Now,  this  doesn't  holdquite  to  the  extent  it  did before because we do  have  components of  M2that  move  with market  rates.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  That would be  interesting  to watch over  time.I'm  not sure  that  that  will  [continue].11/17/81right.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  it  is  atrophying a little,  that's  quite

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Just  following up  on your  comment,  Steve:Earlier  in  the  year,  of  course,  we did have  that M2  constraint  as  weall  know, but  at  the  October  6th meeting  that proviso  clause  on M2  wasdropped  and we  set  sort  of  independent  paths  for M1-B and M2.  It  wasmy impression, and you probably have more recent  data  than  I've beenable  to  look  at,  that  in  this  latest  period since  the  October meetingboth M2  and M1-B have  fallen below the  path we  set.  Is  that  true?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  The  M2  figure  for  October has  fallen below byabout  a couple  of  percentage points;  our  expectation at  the  time  thatwe  [constructed]  the path was  [a  growth rate  of]  11.8 percent  and itwas  published at  9.3  percent.  In  very recent weeks,  the  latest  datashow an upturn  in M2  because  of  the persisting  strength in  moneythat we've observed in  savings  deposits at  commercial  banks.  So wethink we're on a trajectory that gives  us  a very  high November.Again, most  of  that  is  just  extrapolating the  trajectory of  the  lastcouple  of weeks.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Well,  in view of  the  fact  that we  apparentlyhave  fallen below the paths  set  at  the October  6th meeting on both ofthe  Ms,  I was a  little curious  about  Peter's  remark about  the verysmall  upward adjustment  made  in nonborrowed reserves.  I think  it  waspretty darn  small.  Do you happen  to  recall  the amount,  Peter?  Wasn'tit  about  $60  million?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  $55  or $56  million  or  something  like  that.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It was  $100  million for  a week;  in  terms  of  a3-week average  it  was  $56  million  or something  like  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  If  I could add one  other point  that  seemsrelevant  to  me:  As  you know,  there  has been  a considerable decline  inrates  as money growth has weakened relative  to  the  longer-run paths.I think we've gotten away with  that  in  the market  in the  sense  thatthe basic  credibility of  the Fed's  longer-term restraint policy hasnot been  seriously questioned.  A minority of  voices--maybe one  ortwo--has been heard here and there  on  the  fringes  raising a question,but by and large  the  Fed's  credibility has not  been questioned.  Ithink  a very vigorous  response  to  achieve an M1-B target when it  wasfalling considerably  short would have very much endangered that[credibility]  to  the  point where  it  would have been questioned  in thisperiod.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any other questions?  If  not,  we canratify the  transactions  if  you  are prepared to.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I move  it.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Second.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Excuse me,  Mr. Chairman.  Is  it  too  late  to  askMr.  Sternlight a question?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No.  Excuse me,  Jim.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  certainly  isn't.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  it's  one  short  question.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Well,  I'd  like  Peter to  expand  on that  laststatement.  What makes  you  so  sure  that  the  credibility of  the  Systemwould have  been called into  question more  vigorously had we  tried  tokeep money growth closer  to  the  targets?  Isn't  that  just  yourimpression?  You  don't have  any hard  [evidence].

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  It's  judgment, Governor--I  can't prove  it--just  from the way  that  our  responses are  watched so  diligently by  anarmy of  Fed watchers  in  the markets.  They are watching  to  see whatour response will  be  and there  are  suggestions  from various  quartersthat  money is  falling  short  and we  ought  to  be doing  this  or  that  torepair  that  situation.  I had the  impression  that  we were  gettingclose  to  the point where credibility could be  questioned each  time  wemade  some  overt move,  whether  it was  on  the  discount  rate  or puttingin  reserves  at  some particular  funds  rate  level  or  something.  We'vealways  run  little  risks  of  that  kind.  We  came  through it  withoutreally  setting  off any  significant reaction but  I don't  think we werethat  far  from  that  on  various occasions  as  we  came  through this

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I might add  that  we always have  the  luxuryhere  of  looking  at  these  things  ex post.  As  I remember  thisintermeeting period--and I may have my  timing off  a  little--we had abig  increase  in M1-B  early in October.  And  the reason  October turnedout  to  be  low was  the  figures  late  in  October that  we  didn't  knowabout until we  were  in November.  Now, in  the middle  of  November, welook back and October  looks  low.  When we were  in  the middle  of

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Also,  pumping  in more  reserves  whenthe  economy is  weak to  compensate for  a  [shortfall]  will  notnecessarily result  in  an  increased money supply.  What  one may find  isthat  it  just  causes  a  further drop  in borrowing  and more  downwardpressure on  interest rates.  We may  end up  not being  any closer  to  ourmonetary  target  and it  may bring about  a more precipitous  [rate]

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  that's  what interest  rates  do.  They getyou  closer  to your monetary  target  if you move--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Yes,  but  there's  a delayed effect.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes.

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  It may not  show up  for  quite a fewmonths.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Why don't we go  ahead with Mr. Axilrod andthen we'll  call  it  all  open  [to  questions].

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, both  statements  gave  us  a littlemenu  of concerns.  I think  the  time has  come  for  comments on  theeconomic  scene  and related comments you might want  to  make  on thefinancial  scene.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  What's your peak-to-troughprojection, Jim?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  About  2 percent  if  one were  to  go  from Q1  1981to  Q1  1982,  and that  compares with  a mean  of postwar contractions  ofabout  2-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  One question, Mr. Chairman:  The third quarterinflation  rate  turned out  to  be quite  a bit higher  than we hadexpected and  I wonder  if  there are  any special  factors  there  or  is  itsomething that's  likely to  continue?  What are  the risks  on that  side?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  It  was a couple  of  special  factors.  Onerelates  to  the  inventory deflator and a technical problem  that  wethink will be  reversed.  Another was  actually a positive  feature  thatturns  out  to  be negative  in  the  short  run.  We had a much  steepersubtracted, it  tended  to  boost the  inflation  rate.  But we  think  onaverage  the  changes  that  we've made  to  the third  and fourth quartersdon't represent  a fundamental  change  in  the  inflation  outlook,although I would say some  things,  such as  service  prices,  have  beencoming  in  higher than  in our previous  forecast.  But  it's  not  a bigproblem at  the moment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Roos.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  I have  a question,  Steve.  As  I understood yourrationale, you're concerned  that  if  interest rates  fall  more quicklythan  somehow would be warranted by present  economic conditions,  thatwould have adverse  consequences.  Am  I not correct  in  saying  that  theonly way  to  stop  interest  rates from declining at  what anyone mightthink  is  an excessive rate  is  to  withdraw money, which has  adepressing effect  on M1-B?  Is  that  correct  so  far?  The only way  tokeep  interest rates  from dropping by what  anyone might  think  is  aprecipitous  amount  is  to be  frugal  in  the way we  supply  reserves?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's  one way, assuming GNP.  GNP could bedifferent.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  All  right.  Let me  ask this  then.  If  we believe,and maybe we  don't,  that  there  is  some relationship  between economicactivity and the  rate  at which  the  aggregates grow, especially thenarrow  aggregate,  and if  in order  to  keep  interest rates  fromplummeting we keep  the  aggregates below what we  think is  [anappropriate]  targeted range,  can't  that  exacerbate the  recession?  And11/17/81if  the recession  is  more pronounced, won't  that  cause  interest  ratesto  be  low anyway?  In  other words, where  does  that  string  of  reasoning--if  you can dignify  it  by  calling  it  reasoning--break down,  Steve?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  the context  that  I had  in  mind was  thatthe Committee  is  making a short-run  decision  for,  let  us  say,  the nextsix  weeks.  And whether  that  decision  is  for  5 percent  growth  inmoney, or  6 or 7 percent--if money growth  turned out  to  be  any one  ofthose  [rates]--and  then  the  Committee went  ahead and attained  its  1982tentative  targets  or something  like  them,  I simply  didn't  think  thatthe  difference  in  those  growth rates  would matter very much.

[SECTION]

MR.  ROOS.  Nor do  I.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  And  they won't  affect  the year  as  a whole--theresult  for  the year  1981--because in  large  part  that's  given.  Or  atleast  the  year  isn't much affected by  those  growth  rates.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Yes, but  I thought  it--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  So,  that drove  me to  worrying about what  kindof volatility might be  promoted in  credit  markets with effects  onexpectations  from short-run  efforts  [to  increase  growth],  given  thefact  that  I assumed the  Committee was  going  to phase  down  into its1982  targets,  or phase down  as  the  year began.  That  drove me  intothese muddy areas  of  how people perceive what happens  in creditthat  a sustained economic weakness was  in  train, that  would start  aspeculative bidding on commodity markets,  use of  credit  for  thosepurposes,  and  things  like  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  ROOS.  Well,  I would  share your thinking that  what we  dotoday in the  short  run  isn't  important.  But my question--and maybe  Iwas premature and  it  should be  considered when we  make  our  longer-termplans--was  on  this  whole question  of  the  relationship of  [declining]interest  rates and the  aggregates.  I think  that  should be  consideredat  that  time,  though maybe  not  today.  I thought  that  you were  reallyaddressing  the  longer-term game plan and--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I was  trying to  say,  President Roos,  that  anelement  in today's  short-run decision probably  should be how theCommittee wants  to phase  into  the  targets  for next year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Ford.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  In  looking at  your  calculations  of  the  effectsthat  the  different alternatives  we're  considering would have  on  rates,I noticed that  you're projecting  that  from today until  our nextmeeting in December, which  is  a period  of  5 weeks  I believe--andcoming into  this  meeting I thought  Peter said  that  the  fed funds  rateis  running a  little  over  13  percent right now--

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  So,  you're  saying  that were we  to  choose  to  expandM1-B over  the  next  5 weeks  at  a rate under  9 percent, we  could have  a100  basis point  drop per week  in  the  fed  funds  rate potentially.  Thatis  the worst we  could have,  is  that  right?11/17/81

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  that  isn't  the worst.  That's  our  bestguess  of  what  these  relationships are.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Is  that  right?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Best  estimates  until--

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Well,  that  did happen for  a while.  As  I recall,when we  put  on credit  controls  over a year ago,  we  did have  the  ratedropping 100  basis points  a week.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Even more  for  a couple  of  weeks  in April.It  was  between  100  and 200 basis  points  a week  for  a few weeks.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  I'm wondering what  is  in  your modeling.  That  wasa very unusual period.  If  we were  trying to  achieve  some  step-up inM1-B  to  get back to  our  announced targets  for  this  year,  I'd besurprised, in  the  absence  of  credit controls,  if  we  were  to  getanything like  the  kind  of precipitous  drop in rates  that  we had undercredit  control.  Wouldn't  you?  How does  your model  generate  this?

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  It  depends  on where we put  the  borrowing.  Ifthose  borrowings  get  too low,  then  rates  can  drop pretty fast.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  the model  would have  generated muchbigger drops  in  rates  than--

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Do you mean, in  other words,  that  this  is  anadjusted number  [from what  the]  model--?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  no.  The  credit  control program[produced]  drops  in money  supply well  below what was  targeted at  thattime.  So,  in  order  to  hit  the  target,  the  declines in  rates  wouldhave been even more--much, much  larger.  So,  this  sort  of  assumeshitting  the  targets.  Moreover,  it  does  it  with  only  6 weeks  to  go;  soyou have  to  get  a lot  of movement  in  it.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  On  the  credibility  question that  you mentioned,Peter,  are you concerned also  about  our  credibility in terms  of  theaggregates  and whether  or  not we're  trying to  keep reasonable  the[deviations  from]  the  long-term paths we've set?  Isn't  that also  acredibility problem in  addition to  the worry about  what happens  if  therates  drop?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think so,  sure.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  In making your judgments,  then, how do  you judgeone kind of  credibility against  the  other?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  carefully.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  We had  some builders  circling the  statue  in  frontof  the Atlanta Fed and they were  thinking  about hanging Mr. Volcker  ineffigy.  Their  argument was:  What  are  you guys  doing?  You're nottaking  care  of  things.  You ought  to  stop worrying about  these  ratesand  let  them  come down.  We  are dying.11/17/81-10-In  that  connection,  I noticed  in the  Greenbook  that  yourhousing  forecast  for the  fourth quarter,  Jim, shows  870,000  starts  onaverage.  That  must mean  there's  a bottom below  that,  which we'regoing  to  face  either  this month or  next month,  where housing  startsare going  to be  reported at  under  800,000 units.  Is  that  what you[expect]?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  No,  not necessarily.  We  have 918,000  orsomething like  that  in October.  So,  it's  below 900,000  on  average forthe next--

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  It  has  to  be.  If  you  have  an average  of  870,000and you have  918,000  for  the  first  month, where  is  the bottom?  I'mworried.  They came  circling  our statue  of  the eagle when  starts were900,000.  What  are  they  going  to--?

[SECTION]

MR. ZEISEL.  840,000  is  our  low  in  [the  quarter].

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  We'll  have a bald  eagle!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Having  resolved  that piece  of  arithmetic,we'll  go  to Mr.  Winn.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman,  it  disturbs  me  to  sit  here  and letus  contemplate what  is  really a fiction, which  is  these numbers  thatwe're  going by.  I'm watching  the volume  of  our check  clearings  inColumbus suddenly shoot  up, which is  an  unusual  phenomenon at  themoment.  If  you  look into  that,  it's  unbelievable  the money  fundtransfers  that  are  being put  through by one  our Columbus banks.  Iwonder  if  the numbers we  are  dealing with here were closer  to  thereality of  transactions  balances if  we'd have  the  same  kinds  ofreactions we're having  to  these numbers.  To play these numbers  outseems  to me  to  be  a serious  mistake  in  terms of  transactions  balancesagainst  the  economy.  I think  these  are  too  low  in  terms  of  reality ifwe  adjust  for  the money  funds,  which are  growing very rapidly  [basedon]  the push being made,  at  least  in our  District, not  only  in termsof  large  corporations  but  of  individuals moving into  these moneyfunds.  The pressure  is  really  very great  to  get  individuals  toconvert  into money  funds,  which are  transaction balances.  It  seems  tome that  it would behoove us  to  move promptly  to  find out whatproportion of  these money  funds  is  in  fact  transactions balances  andto  start  to  factor  that  into  our thinking  about  these  aggregates,  ifthis  becomes  a guide  in  terms  of  our  policy.My  second point  is  that  it  seems  to  me we're  stuck not onlywith arbitrary numbers  but  that  our  perspective is  too  short.  If  wethink a bit  longer  term about  what we're  trying to  do, we  get awayfrom some  of  these  extremes  in  our  thinking  concerning this  5-weekperiod.  Third, to  try to  get  away  from this  damn  base drift problem,which  is  going  to  kill  us  on  the  one  side as  it  did  last year  on theother,  I'd put  this  in perspective by  going back  to  the  fourth  quarterof  '79  and then making  some growth  rate projections  out  into  theseperiods  for what  it  takes  to  get us  on a  reasonable path from  thatlevel  until  the March  figure gives us  somewhat different  numbers  thanhave  been presented  to  us  here.  So,  this  is  a series  of  things  thatwe  need to  think about  in  our policy  considerations.11/17/81-11-On  the  economic  front,  I have  a concern which is  not  sharedby my colleagues,  I must  confess.  I think we've  kind of  gotten  overthe  interest  rate bulge  temporarily here  in  terms  of  pressure  oncorporations.  But  I have  a feeling that  the profits  squeeze  issetting  in and that  some managements  are going  to  throw in  the  toweland  that  we're  going  to  have more  financial problems  in  the  monthsahead than I think  are  factored  into  some  of  these  forecasts.  I don'tknow what  the  fallout  of  that  is  going to  be  in  terms  of  psychology[and  the effect  on]  this  turnaround  that  is  projected  in  the monthsahead.  This  really is  causing me  concern because  of  the  fallout thatwould have  for  financial  institutions  that  think  they're in prettygood shape  and could suddenly wake up with  some  rather sick  loans ontheir hands  that  really aren't  [known by]  the public.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let me make  a couple of  comments  onyour  comments.  On  that  one,  I am somewhat encouraged in  a perversesort  of  way  that  the bankers  I have  been talking  to  recently realizethat  they may have  some  credit problems  on  their  hands,  if  realizationis  the  first  step toward appropriate policies.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  On  your  first point  on money market  funds,I agree with  the  general direction of your  comment.  It's  very hard tomake  statistical  analyses.  We've  tried to  make  some.  I forget  allthe  assumptions, but  on what  I think would be  considered the mostconservative assumptions  that  adds  somewhat over  1 percent to  M1-B  interms  of  transactions  balances.  But  that kind of  calculation allowsnothing  for  indirect  effects,  for  example  that  an  individual minimizeshis  transactions  balance  simply because  he  has  a money market  fund andknows  he  can draw upon  it  even  if  he doesn't  draw upon it  frequentlyor  at  all.  [The  problem]  is  a matter of  continuing  concern.  Butthere's no  figure  that comes  out  that  says  this  much of  the  money

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  Can't we go back and take  a look at  some  of  theseaccounts and see  to  what extent  they really have--?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  these  calculations derive--and  Idon't know how good the  basic  data  are--[from information]  that  saysthere's  this much  turnover or  this  much  check usage  on these moneythey were NOW accounts  instead of  money market  funds,  they'd be  thisbig.  And that  accounts  for  a relatively small  fraction of  moneyimpact.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  We also  had an informal  Michigan survey wherewe asked people what  percentage of  the  money market  funds  weretransactions accounts  to  them  and what were such  and such?  A verysmall percentage was  transactions.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  What strikes  me  is  the  number  of  people  one  talksto  who are becoming aware of  them  and now starting to use  them.  Thatreally  is  accelerating.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  this  survey was  conducted a  few monthsago.11/17/81-12-

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  That's  the  thing.  I think  in  the  last  few monthswe've  seen  a really marked  shift  into  this  sort  of account.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't have  the  figures  with me  to  lookat  these  things  in a longer-term perspective, but  I'd like  to  look atthat.  I should get  those  figures,  Steve.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  I have  it  in  a chart.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The year-to-year changes  are quiteorderly.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  If  you  took the  '79  base that  [Mr.  Winn]  mentionedand  [drew]  a  cone  out  from  '79--in other  words,  if  there  were no  basedrift--the growth  of M1-B  that  we've had  would put us  inside  therange,  just  below  the  middle  according to  my chart.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Mr.  Chairman,  as  a matter  of  interest,  I've  putthe  1981  average  over  1980  in  the Bluebook.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Yes,  it's  there  in  the back  of  the  Bluebook.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Where?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It's  on page  6;  it's  the  last  line  for  M1-B.This  happens  to  be  a year where  the  difference between  the  Q4-to-Q4figure  and  the  [yearly]  average-over-average  is  a lot bigger  than  itis  ordinarily.  The  difference  is  ordinarily more  like  1 or  at  themost 2 percentage points.  As you  can  see,  it's  close  to  2-1/2  or  2-3/4  percentage  points.  That  is,  M1-B looks  like  it will  grow about  4-1/2  percent  year-over-year whereas  for  Q4-to-Q4  it's  only growing--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  These are  adjusted figures?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  this  is  shift adjusted.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's because  we  got  [growth]  early  in  theyear;  so  far  it  has been high.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  I'm not  sure  in  this  calculation whetherwe  ended  up shift  adjusting  1980,  but  that would  lower  it  from 4.5  to4.4  or  4.3  percent;  it  wouldn't be  that  much of  a difference.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We started  high?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  This  would reverse next year,  Steve.  If  itstarts  low,  then  it  will  end up--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Oh,  yes.  It  averages  out  that  over  [the  two]years  they both come  out  the  same,  I think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I might  also  say that  I have  no confidencein  this  shift  adjusted  figure  anymore.  I think  it  was an  appropriatething  to  do  earlier  in  the year.  But  at  some point  it  loses  me,  interms  of  significance.  I think we  have  already passed  the point whereit  loses me,  but  it's not--11/17/81-13-

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It's  having very  little  effect  now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it  had a quarter  of  a percentagepoint  or more  [effect]  in  the  second half  of  the  year,  I think.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  it's not--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  nothing drastic.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It's  not  unreasonable  to  say, Mr. Chairman--Ihesitate  to  mention  it--that  the  staff,  and in  a sense  all  of  us,underestimated the  offsetting downward  shift we would get  [along with]the  upward shift  in M1-B  from shifts  in  savings  accounts.  There weredownward shifts  in movements  of  demand deposits  into  other  things.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that's  the  money market  fundquestion.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's  right.  In  some  sense  we have  twooffsetting errors here.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  But  it  seems  to me  that  it  all  works  in  thesame direction.  If  you go back  to  the  beginning of  the year and lookat  the  spread between  the  M1  and M2  targeted growth rates,  it  wasgoing to  be  2-1/2  percentage points.  But we had  fudged that;  it  wasreally something like  3-1/2  points.  Now, if  you  look at  where  theyear  is  probably going to  come out,  that  spread that we  thought waspoint  difference in  the  observed spread versus what we  thought thespread was  going  to  be  suggests  to  me  that  the weight  of  the  argumentis  overwhelmingly  in  the  direction of  M1-B being understated,  whetherit's  because  of  money market  mutual  funds  or  whatever.  While  I'munder no  illusions  that  we knew exactly the  relationship  last  Januaryeither,  that  alone  leads me  to  the  conclusion that  I simply am notnearly as  preoccupied with what the  statistical measure  of  M1-B isversus what  I think  the  reality is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Partee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I just  wanted  to point  something out--noton  this  subject--[though]  I agree  that  the  velocity of M1-B hasincreased because  of  the  money market  funds.  After all, we'llprobably have  a 9 percent  increase  in nominal  GNP this  year withgrowth  of  only a couple percent  on M1-B, which  is  unprecedented.  Thathas  to  mean  a considerable  shift  has  occurred.But  what  I wanted  to  point out was  that when  Steve  speaksabout  the  trajectory--plotting a course  that would  take  us  through thewinter  and into  the  spring--he  has been very careful  every  time he  hasreferred  to  it  in a statement  to  say  "assuming the economicprojection."  And I would  argue  that  this begs  the question, because  Ihave a certain amount  of  sympathy with Larry's  first  question.  I heldmy hand up when he  asked  it,  though  it  has  been some  time  since Larrymade  his  comment.  There could be a circularity here that  in  effecthas  a trajectory to  no place,  or  as  we  say in  regard  to  the discountrate  "a bridge to  nowhere."  That's because,  in fact,  we may find  thatthe  nominal  GNP numbers  fade  as  we move  ahead.  We've had a little  ofthat,  certainly,  in  the  fourth quarter  [with  GNP]  being quite  a bit11/17/81weaker  than we were  anticipating all  year.  I have  a sense  of  a littleshortfall  from our  projections  as  we've  gone  through the  year.  We'vecertainly had big  shortfalls  in  relation to  our  expectations  on M1-B.I looked  at  it  and we  have been below  our  expectations  of M1-B  atthese meetings  for  six  consecutive months,  and  the average  shortfallhas  been  7 percent  over  that  6-month period.  We've  even been  short  onM2  compared to  our  expectations,  the paths  that  we  selected when wewent  into  the period.  In  the  case  of  M1-B,  that's  partly because  ofthis  velocity problem.  But  I think  it's  partly because  of  shortfallsin economic performance,  too.It's  hard  for me  to  believe  that  there will  not be  aneconomic  recovery commencing  in the  second half  of  next  year, giventhe  size  of  the  deficit  that we'll  have  and  the  further  cut  in  taxesthat will  occur as  of  July 1st.  But  it's  a  fair piece  until  themiddle  of  next  year,  and I'm not at  all  sure  that we  can  say withgreat  confidence  that  the economy might  not decline a good  dealfurther below the  projection,  [say,  by]  the  end of  the  first  quarter,which could give  us  quite a  serious  problem as  it  occurs.  If  that  istrue,  and  if  we hold up  interest  rates,  then  we will  get  thecontraction  in transactions  balances  that  will  make possible  acontinuation of poor business.  So,  I just  wanted to point  out  thatSteve  has  been very careful  every time  he  referred to  the longer-runplanning always  to  assume  as  a caveat  that  the  economic  assumption wasright.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I keep  hearing, particularly from  smallbusinessmen,  that  there is  a lot  of  pent-up demand both  in  terms  ofconsumer  spending and  investment demand,  if  only interest  rates  wouldcome  down.  They're  referring mostly  to  bank rates  and mortgage  rates.I wonder,  Jim,  if  there's  any  reason why that  should be more  true  thistime  around  than  in previous  recessions--that  there  would be moreinterest rate  sensitivity on  the  demand side.  One  can  say that mayberates were  so  high  that  people  backed  off.  But  if  it's  true  thatthere  is  this  pent-up  demand,  that  seems  to  me  to  argue  for  a  shorterrecession of  a more traditional V-shape.  But  I haven't  been able  tocome  up with  any really convincing reasons  why  it's  necessarily  truethat  there  ought  to  be more pent-up demand waiting on more  interestrate  [declines]  this  time  than  other times.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Well,  I think  it's  a mixed picture.  A  coupleof  years  ago we had what were  really  fairly  strong  forecasts,  giventhe  interest rate  assumptions.  Our thinking  there  was  largelyconditioned by the  inflationary experience  and a rough  calculation ofreal  interest  rates.  We didn't  think real  rates  were  that high and wehad relative  to the  model  forecast--at  least  our own model--a  fairlystrong GNP projection.  Looking  at  it  now,  the argument  is  a bitdifferent.  Our  inflation  forecast,  looking  ahead,  is  coming down.  Inthe mortgage market  there is  a good deal  of  underlying  demand that'srelated to  demographic  factors,  and  the  interest  rate  is  a  constraint.But  I'm not  sure  I'd  frame  it  in  terms  of  the  interest  elasticityhaving changed;  we've  just  choked off  a lot  of  potential  demand  in  thelast  two or  three  years.  In  the  auto  area,  our view is  that  interestrates  are  probably a small  factor  in  the  depressed state  of  theI don't perceive  the notion  that  rates  coming  down a bit--say the11/17/81-15-mortgage rate  goes  from  18  to  16  percent--as  a dramatic  factor.  Now,if  you talk about  the  mortgage rate  coming down  into  the  12  percentarea,  for example,  then  I think big  things will  happen.  So,  ratherthan  focus  solely on  the  interest  rate  effects, we  believe  there  aremany things  going on  in  various markets.  It's  not  just  that  theinterest rate  elasticity is  so  high  that we're going  to  get  a bigbounceback, given where we're starting.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  One other  comment  on  the  inflation front:  I hada number of meetings  with groups  of  15  or 20  people and I asked  themwhat  kinds  of  assumptions  on  inflation  they were  building into  theirbusiness  budgets.  I didn't  find an overwhelming  number of people  whowere reducing  their  own  internal  assumptions  on  inflation.  Out  of  agroup  of  15  or  20  people,  maybe 2 or  3 people were  actually loweringtheir budget  assumptions.  But  I did  find a difference in businessesthat  are  unionized and  those  that  aren't  unionized.  Unionizedbusinesses  tend to  see  noticeably  less  feistiness on  the  part of  theunions  in  terms  of  wage  demands, but  in  the nonunionized  areas  I don'tfind  that  happening.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  do you  find  to  be  the  typicalinflation forecast  in  these planning budgets?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I would  say most  are  in  the  9 to  10  percentrange, with  a few  outliers down  around 8 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  accords  with my experience,  but  Ifind more  outliers  above  than  below.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  Well,  I hear people who  talk about  [inflation]above  10  percent.  Probably more people  say  they  see  it  above  10  thansee  it  at  8 percent;  but most  of  them are  around  9 to  10  percent.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The people  say  that  they'replanning on  a 5 to  6 percent  wage  increase  next year.  But  they arenonunion.  They pay relatively low wages;  they  [start  with]  theminimum wage,  I think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Rice.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Mr. Chairman,  at  the  last  several  meetings  I'vebeen  saying that  the  economy was sluggish,  bumping along  somewherebetween no  growth and very  low growth.  I thought  that was  a goodthing in  terms  of  a desire  to  reduce  inflationary pressures  and  Ithought  it  would be good  if  we could keep  the  economy  in  that mode.But  now we  see that  the  economy has  not  remained  in  that pattern.Nearly all  of  the  indicators  point  to  a recession.  And,  as  theRedbook  indicates,  pessimism is  widespread among businessmen.  Itappears  to  me  that  the  only question  really is  how deep  the recessionis  going  to  be.  My own  judgment  is  that  the  staff  forecast  is  aboutright.  I would differ only slightly  as  to  the  timing of  theturnaround.  The  staff  sees  a mild upturn  in GNP  in  the  second quarterof next year.  I do not  see  a turnaround appearing as  early as  thesecond quarter.  I do  not  see  the  mild pickup  in housing  and inautomobiles  and  in  inventory that  the  forecast  is  based upon.  I thinka turnaround has  to  await  the  tax  cut  of  midyear and  that  it  probablywill  be  toward  the  end of  the  third  quarter before we  see  any  realsigns  of  recovery.  So,  I would put  the  recovery  further  back in  time,11/17/81-16-which means  that  we're  likely  to  see  very low economic  activitycontinuing  longer.  In  other words,  the  duration of  the  recessionwould be  longer  than is  projected.  I'm  also more optimistic  about  theinflation picture  for next year.  In my view  the  course  of  inflationwill  be somewhat  less.  The staff  is  projecting an  average  inflationrate  of  something  like  8.8  percent,  and  I would expect  it  to  beslightly lower  than  that.I was  interested  to  hear Mr. Axilrod say he  saw significantdifferences between  this  downturn and  the  one  that  occurred  in thespring  of  last  year.  I certainly  agree with  that.  This  is  a muchmore  classic  recession.  I don't  think  it will  be  V-shaped;  I don'tthink there will be  a very quick snapback because  the  conditions  aredifferent  and the  basis  for a  quick snapback  in consumer  and businessspending seems not  to  be present  now.  The main  issues  that  seem to  bebefore  us  then are: (1) How much  of a drop  in  interest  rates would wefind acceptable  in  the  current  circumstances;  and  (2) How much ofshortfall  in  the growth  of  M1-B  from  its  target  range would we  findacceptable.  And related  to  both of  these questions  is,  of  course,  thecredibility issue.  What  happens  to  our credibility  if  we  allowinterest  rates  to  fall  below whatever  level  we  find acceptable  andwhat happens  to  credibility if  we  continue  to  allow money growth tofall  substantially below the  target range?  I see  our  credibilitybeing  called  into  question much more when we are seen  as  letting up  ina situation where  inflation is  gathering momentum and  when interestrates  are  rising  [than  if]  money is  tight  and we  appear  to  be  lettingup--and I emphasize  appear--in  a situation when interest  rates  arefalling  and  the  economy is  weakening.  In current  circumstances  it'smuch more  important  to  be perceived as  sticking  to  our  objectives andtaking  our monetary  growth  target  seriously.  Therefore,  at present--and I refer now to  the period over  the  next  six weeks  to  two months--it's  important  to be  seen as  not  contracting the  narrowest monetaryaggregate, M1-B,  further than we  had intended to  six weeks  ago.  Iwould think  that  our  credibility depends  a great deal  at  this  time  onwhether we are willing  to  appear  to  move  in  the  direction  of  trying  toachieve our  target  for  M1-B.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Schultz.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Well,  one comment  about  what Mr. Boehne  said:As  far  as  latent  demand  is  concerned, we've  had a policy of  monetaryrestraint  for  a couple  of  years now and  it  does  stand  to  reason  thatin  the  interest  sensitive  sectors,  which have been  under pressure  forthat  length  of  time,  there would be  some  latent  demand--certainly, forexample,  in housing.  The auto  sector would seem  to  have  some  latentdemand because  of  scrappage  on  the one  hand and because of  the  recentvery rapid rise  in used car prices;  one would assume  that  would havesome  connection.  I happen  to  feel  that  auto sales  may be  a bit  moreinterest sensitive  than  the  staff  does,  as a psychological  factor,  ifnothing else.  I recognize  the  sticker  shock phenomenon.  Anotherinteresting  thing to  note  is  that  in the  quarterly  survey of  theNational  Association of  Small  Businesses  a large percentage  ofrespondents  say  that  their biggest problem is  interest  rates.  Butonly a portion of  those people  say that  the  problem  is  that  they areunder  terrific pressure.  A  lot  of  very solid  small  businesses  saythat  they'd  like  to  expand  if  interest  rates would  come down,  so Ithink there's  considerable  latent  demand  in  that  area  as  well.11/17/81-17-

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think you're  quite  right  about  that.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Let me  speak  to  what Bill  Ford had to  say,because  I think that's  the  crux of  the  matter at  this point  in  time.I believe  that  the  very high  interest rates  have been  a primary causeof  the  recession we're  in.  If  that's  the  case,  then we  certainly needto  have  lower  interest rates  before the  economy begins  to pull  up.And  I think we  clearly do need lower  interest  rates.  There  are  threethings,  though, that  bother me  a great  deal  about  the  speed and depthof  that drop  [in  rates].  The  first  is  that  if  we  let borrowing  go  toolow--I'm not  sure  about  Steve's  frictional  level  of  $50  to  $100million because  I have  a feeling it  may be a little  higher--we getinto a situation where  the  funds rate  could drop very precipitously.And  if  the  funds rate were  to  drop  to  a negative  real rate,  that wouldbe  an indication to  the  market  that would not  be  very  favorable.  Youasked Peter what his judgments  were  about  expectations.  The  fact  isthat  the army  of  Fed watchers  out  there  has history on  its  side  infeeling  that we are  going to  cave in.  We have  in  the past  and  theycontinue  to  expect history to  repeat  itself.  So,  I think a very  sharpand precipitous drop  in  the  funds  rate could have  seriousexpectational  consequences.The  second part  follows  on  that  expectational  point.  It  isimportant  that  we get  mortgage rates  down  if  we're going to  get  somerecovery in  housing.  Now, how do we go  about doing  that?  Well,  if  weget  more  savings  flows  into the  thrifts,  that helps.  If  the  rates  onall  the  other  alternative  investments  come down,  then the mortgageswill  look  better.  But the  fact  is  that  the  thrifts  have been  killedby investing in mortgages  over  the years,  so  the  expectational  factoris  very important  for  them  in  terms  of  when  they're  going to  startmaking mortgage  loans  again.  The  California  thrifts  keep  coming  inand  telling us  that  they're  not making any mortgages  at  all  even withthese very high rates.  So,  how do  we get  them to  [make  such loans]?I'm not  sure that  a very precipitous  drop  in  short-term rates  is  thekind of  thing that would make  the  thrifts  feel  that  they'd want  to  goout  and  start making mortgage  loans  again.  The expectational  factorsare  important  there.  I don't  really know how to  assess  that,  but  it'ssomething  to  be  considered.The  final  thing that  just  scares  the devil  out  of  me--itgives  me some  nightmares--is  what will  happen if  we do  get  thisrecovery in  the  first  or  second quarter  and then  the tax cut  comes  in;I just have  to  feel  that  interest  rates  are  going  to  start back upagain at  some  point  in  time.  Now, 1982  is  an  election year.  Whatkind of  problems will  this  country  face  in  its  anti-inflation effortsif  we are  in a period of  rising  interest rates  in a politicalcampaign?  On  the  question of  how  rapidly  interest rates  come down andhow rapidly they come back up,  in  talking to  small  businesses  of  alldifferent  kinds,  my sense  is  that  there  are  thousands  of  them outthere  that  are hanging on by  their  fingernails  and they're going  tocontinue  to  hang  on when they  see  interest  rates  coming down.  Butwhen  they see  those  interest rates  start  to  turn back up again,  Ithink a lot  of  them are  going  to  let  go,  and we  could be  facing  areally, really serious problem.  Willis Winn brought  in a letter  thismorning which he  says  is  typical  of  what he has  been getting frombusinessmen.  In  effect  it  says  that  the Fed is  being  too  tight  andit's  causing  the  recession and not  letting  the  President's programwork.  It's  that  kind of  argument.  Now, what  happens  if we get  into11/17/81-18-the  summer  in  a political  campaign  under those  kinds  of  circumstances?I just  have  a feeling  it  could wreck  the  whole  anti-inflation campaignand  then we're  in  deep trouble.  I think we  do need to  get  interestrates  down.  It's  important.  But  the  speed and depth  of  that  drop andthe  potential  for  the  rebound is  something that  we really have  to  keepin mind.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Gramley.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  some  of  the  things  I'm going  to  say echowhat  Fred has  just  said.  As  I  listen  to  the  staff,  they are  tellingus,  I  think,  that  we are  in a classic  recession now.  It  is  quitepervasive across  sectors;  it  has  cumulative  characteristics, but  theeconomy is  by no means  falling apart.  We are not  looking at a  1974-75;  we're not  looking  at  a  second quarter  of  1980.  I find myself  inbroad agreement with that,  and  I think that  is  what  the  tone  of  theRedbook  is  saying  also.  But,  frankly,  I don't  like  what we're  goingthrough.  I would much rather  have  seen a continued  more or  lesssideways path instead  of  heading into  a  recession.  If  we  look back atwhat has been happening  in the  last  two  years, we  find  that  theeconomy got  too weak  in  the  early part  of  1980  and  it  got  too  strongin  the  last  half  of  1980  and  then it  was  too weak  again.  In  allcandor  we have  to  acknowledge  that  the behavior  of  financial variableshas been principally responsible  for  that.  I don't  think we  ought  tocast  any blame.  If  I had been responsible  for  running the  whole  thingmyself,  I don't  know that  I could have done  any better  and  I may wellhave done worse.I certainly agree with Willis  Winn's  comments  that  we'relooking  at  the behavior  of  a measure of  transactions balances  that  wehave not  the  foggiest notion  of  how to  interpret.  But  I don't  thinkthe  answer  is  simply to  recast  our  statistics, because what we'regoing  through is  a wholesale change  in ways  of  portfolio management  onthe  part of  both  businesses and  individuals.  And it's  going  to  take  along,  long  time  for  this  to  shake  down until  we  finally understandwhat these monetary aggregates mean.  I think what we have  to do  is  totake  into  account  what  is  happening  to  interest rates,  at  least  tosome  degree;  and  there  just  isn't  any doubt in my mind that  interestrates have  gone  through much  too wide  swings  in  the past  couple  ofyears.  In retrospect,  I come  to  the conclusion  that when we  let  thefed  funds  rate  get up  to  the  18  to  20  percent  range,  the behavior  ofthe  economy subsequently has  become  too weak.  And when we  let  it  getdown into  the  8 to  10  percent  range,  the  economy has become  toostrong..  Now, those  are rather wide limits,  but  somewhere  betweenthose  two  limits  is  where we  want to  be.I agree with Mr.  Axilrod's  comments  that  the  economy  isdifferent  now than  it was  in the  second quarter  of  1980,  so we're notgoing  to  see  the  same  kind of  response  that  ensued upon  removal  ofcredit  controls  when  interest  rates on  short-term securities wereslightly below 10  percent.  But  let  us  remember also  that  we have anenormous  amount  of  fiscal  stimulus  coming along  in  the  latter half  ofnext year,  and  that's  going  to  work the  other way.  And I  agree withEd  Boehne  that we have  a lot  of  pent-up  demand out  there  that  couldbegin  to  affect  the  economy  if  interest  rates  come down  a  lot  further.The most  important policy question  we need to  focus  on  as  aCommittee  today is  how far  and how fast  we want  interest  rates  to  fall11/17/81-19-from here.  I would remind you  that  interest rates  are  already  lowerthan  the  trough  level  of  interest rates  that  underlies  the  staffforecast.  The  staff  forecast has  a trough  level  of  Treasury billrates--that  is,  on  short-term securities--of  11-1/2  percent  in  thefirst  quarter of  1982.  We're already below that.  I think we will  seea significant  further  reduction in  important  rates  of  interest  likemortgage  rates  if  short-term rates  stay where  they are  for  a while.It  may well be  that  some  further decline  in  short  rates  isappropriate, maybe  even desirable, but we  need to  be  extremelycautious in how far we  let  them go because  inevitably if  the  economybegins  to  recover strongly, with a combination  of  a relaxation offinancial  constraints and  fiscal  stimulus,  the  rates  are  going torocket back up  again.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  know how many people we  canget  through here,  but  let's  try a couple more.  Mr. Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  in  every recession  there  is  a periodwhere one  becomes  alarmed  if  it  looks  worse  than one  had expected.And that  is  the period that  I think we're passing  through now.  But  Ithink the  staff  is  right  that  there  is  a  foundation under  the  economy.It's  partly the  tax cut  next  year.  I think the  pent-up demand inhousing, automobiles,  and  investment,  as  it  gradually comes  alive,will  prevent a very deep  drop.  So,  I think concern  of  a very severerecession  isn't  justified.  If  the  economy  is  worse  than  it  seemed afew months  ago,  so  is  the  inflation outlook, or  at  least  it  hasn'timproved.If  I may go  back for  a moment  to  the  targeting problem  thatLarry Roos raised,  the way I understand  this  is  that  the  Committeesets  the money supply path and  the borrowing assumption.  The  staffderives  from that  a total  reserves path and a nonborrowed reservespath  given  the borrowing assumption  [and]  we then  target  thenonborrowed.  And a change in  the  nonborrowed  [path]  would simplyamount  to  going back  to  total reserves  targeting.  A change  in  thenonborrowed  [path]  is  the  analogue  of  a discount  rate  change.  It's  amajor  decision and  it  should be made  by  the  Committee, not  just  maderoutinely because we're  not hitting  the  money supply  target.  The  samecould be  said about  changing the total  reserves  target.  That  too,  itseems  to  me, can miscarry as  a result  of  excess  reserves  building upor being drawn  down, and  the  target  should not be changed without aCommittee decision.On the  aggregates,  I share what has been said about  M1-B.It's  not  a sacred number;  it's  a very profane number.  It  has beenmisspecified.  There's  a member  of  the  Shadow Open Market Committee  inNew York  who has an adjusted M1-B that  is  growing at  a 10  or  12percent annual  rate.  All he does  is  put  in  50  percent of  money marketmutual  funds  and overnight  Eurodollars  and RPs.  You can--

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  So,  he's not  complaining  about  theshortfall?

MR. WALLICH.  He's  not complaining.  He  has been complainingabout our excessive  reserve  expansion, you see.  Everybody can findsomething wrong with us.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Who's  that, Heinneman?11/17/81-20-

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Heinneman.  I think  that Willis  is  perfectlyright  that  the bank  in  Ohio  is  in  effect making  it  possible  to  have  azero balance  checking account.  And I think we're moving  further  inthat  direction.  So,  M1-B  is  highly suspect.  Well,  I guess  I won'tsay any more  on the  aggregates.  Just  a word on  interest  rates:  Whathas  been said  here is  exactly what I  think.  If  we  stick  firmly to  anaggregates  target, we're  going to  have very wide  swings  in  short-termrates.  After  a while  long-term rates will  cease  to  follow this  raterace  and will  probably  remain high because people have  the  experience,if  they ever  buy bonds,  of  losing money as  bond prices  rise.  If  weget  a V-shaped  interest rate  [move],  we'll  lose  credibility.  I thinkour credibility is  really much more  linked  to  interest  rates;  manymillions  of people are  more  interested in  them  than  in  the monetaryaggregates  in  which, at  least  in Washington  outside  of  three  buildingsnot  including  this  one,  there  isn't  all  that  much  faith.

I'm  simply trying  to  say that  Ithink we  ought  to  aim at  a saucer-type  movement  of  interest rates.  Irecognize that  we need  to  have  some  compromise between not  completelyletting  go of  our aggregates  targets  and avoiding excessive moves  ininterest rates.  That's what we need.  And  in  that  process,  we oughtto  avoid getting  to  negative  real rates,  as  Fred  said.  Thank you.

MR. BALLES.  Out  our way we happen  to have  a big worldwideengineering  outfit called  Bechtel  Engineering and  they've  just hadsome  publicity about a brand new kind of  business  they're gettinginto.  They  think there's  a great  future  in  it.  It's  called

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I thought  they were  decontaminating  the M1figure.  That's  what George  Schultz  said!

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  Maybe we  should have  George's  boys  take a  lookat  our problem with the  Ms and  see  if  we  can get  some decontaminationand decommission!  I was  kidding Dave  Lindsey that  if  I were  his boss,I'd give  him an  assignment  to  answer  the  question:  "Will the  realmoney supply please  stand up?"What  I have  to  say today  is  that  I'm torn between Lyle'spoint  that  we don't  really know what  these Ms mean  anymore--and  I amvery sympathetic  to  that--versus my  feeling that  we  want  to  avoid aprocyclical  monetary policy.  As  I look back over  the  last  couple  ofyears,  we  took very positive  action in  focusing on  a gradual11/17/81-21-we had a lot  of  guts  in  letting interest  rates rise  to  unprecedentedlevels  in  carrying that  out.  And  I guess  I would be a littleuncomfortable  if  we weren't  symmetrical  on  the  down  side.  But  giventhe  recession  we're now in  and our  guesses  as  to  how  long  it  willlast,  it  wouldn't bother me  to  see  interest  rates come  down  somewhatfurther.  I'm considerably influenced  in  that  by the  real  risks  I seeof  this  downturn getting more  serious  than  the  staff projects,although I can't  really disagree with  their  forecast.  But  the  risksare  there;  we  all  know  about  them.  There  are very serious  risks  inthe  thrift  industry, extremely serious  recessions--and  that's  the  onlyword  for  it--in  the  forest products  industry and the  auto  industry,and  there  is  a cost-price squeeze  going on  in agriculture.  To  theextent  that  we  can give  them some near-term  relief,  lower rates,  itwould  simply head off  the  risks coming  from  those  sectors  ofconverting this  present  recession into  a major contraction.  I'mhoping  that  we'll  avoid  an  actual  shrinkage  in  the  money supply  suchas  we had in  the mid-1970s.  And while  I certainly wouldn't want  tosee  the  extreme  fluctuations  in  interest rates  that  we witnessed  in1980,  I don't  see  very much risk of  that  happening  in  late  1981  andearly  1982.  Maybe  I've  been brainwashed by being too  close  to  theforest products  industry, but  I recently appeared on  a paneldiscussion along with Henry Reuss  and they were ready  to  hang me  ineffigy, Mr.  Chairman,  instead of  you, maybe as  your proxy.

MR. SCHULTZ.  That  gives  [unintelligible]  more  important.  Ifthey hang  them all,  that's  all  right.

MR. BALLES.  To  Henry's credit,  I'm glad to  say that hesupported what we have  been doing.  He said  it  was necessary and waswhat  just  had to  be done.  That was  a pleasant  surprise;  I didn't  haveto  fight with him.  But  I'll  tell  you, I do  have to  fight with  thebuilders and the  forest  products people  who  say  they are  bleeding  todeath or hemorrhaging.  They say:  What can you  do  for us?  And do  itsoon because if  you don't  do  it  soon,  it's  going  to  be  too  late.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Just  to  comment  on the  situation  in the  ChicagoDistrict,  the problems,  of  course, have been serious  all  year butthere  certainly has been  further deterioration since  our  last  meeting.And it's clear  that  [just  about]  all  of  the  sectors have  now beenaffected, with very few exceptions.  Turning  to  the  auto situation,this point, of  course,  is  gone.  The  optimism that  some  of  them havefor  1982  is  significantly  eroded and  I think  the  automotive situation,therefore, is  very serious.  Capital  expenditures  in  our area havebeen  further curtailed, particularly  in  the  automotive  industry, withsignificant cutbacks.  The Christmas  shutdown schedules, which werealready going to be heavy, have  been extended considerably.  Thisrecession  is  a little  different  in  the Midwest  than other  recessionshave  been.  In  the past  the  agricultural  sector has  offset  theindustrial sector.  This  time  that  is  not  the  case.  Because  of  highproduction, farm  incomes are  down  and,  as  a result,  the  agriculturalarea  is  also  in  a very serious  predicament.  And that  has  impacts  on11/17/81-22-people who manufacture products  for  that  sector,  several  of whom havegotten  themselves  into very weakened, precarious positions.  In  turn,the  banks  that  extend  credit  to  the  farms  are beginning to  see  someslowdown  in payments,  and  I think  it  is  inevitable  that  there  will  besome problem  loans  developing  among those banks  as  they go  through  aforeclosure procedure.I am considerably more pessimistic  than  most with regard tothe  outlook for  '82.  I admittedly  come  from an area where  there  is  avery heavy concentration  of  industries  that have  been most  affected.But  I am beginning to  wonder  if  the  consensus  view  that we will  allcome  to  work on  the  first  of  July and  find  that  someone has  turned  thelights  on  is  really going  to  come  to  pass.  I think we're placing anawful  lot  of  hope  that  the  tax  cut will  produce  significant benefits.I think the  recovery will  begin to  take  place as  we  see a permanent ormore  lasting  impact  on  inflation.  And until  we  get  into  the  contractsettlements  next  year,  I don't  think one  can  forecast how  that  willcome about.  I don't want  to  imply that  any of  this  should indicate  asignificant  change  in policy for  us.  On  the  contrary, we  continue  tohave  the  broad support  of  the  business and  financial  industry  and  Ithink  they would  encourage  us  to  stay with the  general  direction  ofour  current policy.  But my hunch  is  that  with  the  economy as weak asit  is  rates  will  continue  to  come down and  we can  continue  to  maintaina  fairly restrictive  stance  on  the  aggregates without  necessarilyhaving a negative  impact  on  the  recovery prospects.  So,  I would urgethat  we continue  with  this.  But  I do  want  to  report  that  thesituation  in  the Chicago District  continues  to  be  serious  and isdeteriorating.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Morris.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman, until  the  last  two peopletalked  it  seemed  that  I was  perhaps one  of  the  few people in  the  roomwho  wasn't  confident  that  I knew what we ought  to  be doing.  But  I dosense  a clear  trend around  the  table  that  we're  fighting last  year'swar,  which of  course  is  always  a danger.  It  seems  to me  that  thelatest  Maginot  line  is  that  if  the  federal  funds  rate drops below 10percent,  the  economy  is  going  to  turn  on  the dime and shoot  uprapidly.  That  seems  to  me,  at  least  for  the  first  half of  1982,  to  behighly unlikely.  Quite  the  contrary,  I think  there  is  a risk  that  ifwe're  too  rigid  in  following  this particular  [policy]  line, we  couldwell  end up  with a much  deeper recession  than we're projecting.  Idon't have  the confidence  that  that would be  the  case, but  that riskis  clearly there.  With that background,  I tried to  read some of  theeuphemisms  that  Steve Axilrod  is  now developing for  the  Bluebook.  Iagree with him, looking at  the  options,  that we're not  going  to affectthe  monetary growth rates  in the  last  weeks  of  this year.  But  hetalks  about  a more restrictive policy producing a  "smoother transitionto  targets  for 1982"  and  that's  the  euphemism that  I've  been trying  tointerpret.  What  I think  it  means--I'd like  to  ask  Steve--is  thatwe're going  to  have  some very low monetary growth rates  early  in  theyear, which would be helpful  in  offsetting very rapid growth  rateslater  in  the  year.  But  if  we  set  out  to produce  overtly very lowmonetary growth  rates  in  the  first  half  when the  economy  is  very weak,we  could generate a  larger  recession  than  any of  us would think wasconstructive  in  the  situation.  Have  I interpreted you wrongly,  Steve?11/17/81-23-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  what  I meant was  that  that alternativewould reduce  the  odds  of  the  funds rate  going  to  5 percent between nowand year-end and  rising back up  to  15  to  20  percent  early next year  asan  effort was made  to  hold the  aggregates next  year down to,  say,  inthe 2-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent range  tentatively  adopted.  That'sliterally what  I had in mind.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Finally,  looking at  the  options  for  thismeeting,  two of  the  options  call  for  a more restrictive policy than weannounced at  the  last  meeting.  It's  hard  for me  to  envisage whateconomic  data have  come  in  over  the  past five  weeks  that would  lead usto  support  a more  restrictive policy  than we  did the  last  time.  Icould certainly buy  "B" because we  could still  say  that  we're shootingfor  7 percent  growth  through  the  rest  of the  year, which  is  a numberwe put  out  last  time.  I find  it  very difficult  to  figure  out how wewould explain coming  out with  the  5-3/4  percent  target underalternative  C, after having given our  sanction to  a 7 percent  growthrate  before we  knew how sharp the  decline  in  the  economy was going  tobe.  I should  think  that would  take  some doing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Corrigan.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly would agree  that  theeconomy  is  soft.  We  even have  some  sense  of  that  in  the  Ninth FederalReserve  District  at  this  point.  And that  softness  is  well  reflectedin  statistics and in business behavior  and sentiment.  My own personalhunch would be  that  the  fourth  quarter  at  least could be  even softerthan the  staff  is  now  suggesting.  But at  the  same  time  I also  sensethat  there  is  at  least  a residue of  optimism  in  terms  of  the  longer-term  outlook and expectations.  In part  that  grows  out  of peoplelooking ahead  to  the  tax  cut  and  in  part out  of  some  of  these pent-updemands  that people  have  been talking  about.  There also  is  still  somelingering hope  that  the  inflation  rate may be coming  down in ameaningful  way, although recent  events perhaps  have not worked in  thedirection of  reinforcing  that.  The  relevant point  here  is  that  if wewant  to  talk about  a sustained recovery--whether  it  starts  in  thesecond quarter or  the  third  quarter--the  sustainability quotient  isgoing  to  depend  on  two  or  three  critical  things.  One  is  bending downthat  inflation rate,  including the  wage  side.  Another  is  the budgetsituation, which hasn't  even been mentioned here,  and as  I would  lookat  that  right now recent  events seem  to  have worked in  the  directionof  making it  harder  rather than  easier  to  get on with  the  furtheradjustments  that have  to  be made  in  that area.  The  other  thing thatis  very important  in  connection with  sustainability is  that we simplyhave  to  create  and maintain an  environment  in which some  of  these veryserious  liquidity and balance sheet  strains that  are  all  over  theeconomy can be  turned around.  And achieving  that  turnaround under  thebest  of  circumstances  is  not  something  that  is  going  to be donequickly or easily.  It's  going  to  take  some time, which  in  turnimplies  that  it will  not  be done  in an  environment  in  which we havethese  zigzag patterns  of  interest  rates  and these  zigzag patterns ofeconomic  activity.  That  leads me very much  in  the  direction thatGovernor Gramley  suggested.  And  fundamentally it  leaves me with theview  that we ought  to  be proceeding  slowly and deliberately withrespect  to  this  interest  rate  situation,  even  though  I, too,  obviouslywould conclude  that  there  is  some  further  latitude  that  can beconstructively used here.  But  I think we have  to  be cautious and we11/17/81-24-have  to  try  to  avoid  some  of  the problems  of  the past  as we  try  towalk  this  very thin  line.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Teeters.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Some  of my concerns  have already beenexpressed.  I have  a strong  feeling  that  we're  monetarists  when theeconomy  is  expanding  and we're  interest  rate  targeters  when it  beginsto  collapse.  If  we move  in and  put a  floor  on  the  interest  rate,which is  what  it  sounds  like  around here,  we'll be in  real  trouble.We  haven't  kept up with what we  said we were  going to  do.  I  thinkthere  is  still  latitude  to  lower  interest  rates from where  they arenow.  This  staff  forecast has  a bottom  rate  on mortgages  of  16-1/2percent;  that  doesn't  speak of  any revival  in  the  housing market  nextyear.  I  think we  can move  it  down.  I agree with  Lyle  that we  havelet  interest  rates  swing both  too high and  too  low.  Or  rather we  letthem  swing  too  high;  I have  seen  very little  evidence  of  theirswinging too  low at  this point.  I think we  will probably want  to  paymore  attention  on the  high side  as  well  as  on  the  low side  in  the  nextcycle.  There's  also  a tendency  to  be very unconcerned when rates  riseand then to  sit  and agonize  for weeks  about  lowering them.  We didthat  last  summer and  a few other  times  on  the  discount  rate.  It  seemsto  me  that we  should be  symmetrical and not  try to  fudge or change  ourphilosophical  point  of  view as  we go  along.If  you  look at  this  forecast--and we have  had a  lot  ofsurprises  in the  forecast  on a quarterly basis  over the  past  threeyears--it  takes  until  the  end of  1982  for real  GNP  to  get back towhere  it  was  at  the beginning of  1980.  Now,  that's  a very, very  slow-growing  economy;  and although  there have been lots  of  ups  and downs,we end up at  the  end of  1982 with an  8.8  percent  unemployment rate  forthree  solid quarters.  That  is  not my definition of  a revivingeconomy.  And we have 8.8  percent  [unemployment]  projected primarilybecause  interest  rates  are  assumed to  rise  next year.  When an  economyis  growing as  little as  this  one  is  projected to  grow with no  impacton  interest  rates,  some  policy parameter  is  wrong.  And  this  is  evenafter  a very large  tax cut  at midyear.  We're not  talking  about anexuberant  economy next  year anyway;  we're  talking  about  an  economythat  is  just barely keeping  its  head above water.  If  we  then  comedown and  set  a  floor on  interest  rates  at  12-1/2  percent, we're goingto  end up  like  the supply  siders did with the  Stockman article;somebody  is  going  to notice  that  the  emperor doesn't  have  any clotheson  and that we  aren't  accomplishing anything.  Our  inflation rates  forthe  past  three  years have been 9.7,  9.8,  and  9.4  percent  and  this  isafter  three  years  of  monetary  restraint.  Every time  we  think we'regoing  to  get  a dip in  the  inflation  rate,  something comes  along and[drives]  it  back up  again.  I think we  should  become  increasinglyconcerned about  the  rate  of real  growth  in this  economy  and do what  wecan  on inflation.  But  [we  also need to]  realize  that we  don't  havecomplete control  and  that we  could do  extreme  harm if  the economycontinues  to  run at  these  very low levels  of  real  utilization.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Well,  that's  forthright, anyway.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Black.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman, I have to  align myself  with thosewho  think  that  the downturn  is  apt  to  be more  serious  than the  staff11/17/81-25-has  suggested.  With a sharp deceleration  in  M1-B growth and the  veryhigh  real  interest rates  here  in  the  summer and  the point  that WillisWinn made  that  there  seem  to  be a  lot  of  [potential]  bankruptcies--which many  of  our contacts are  telling us  will  surface pretty soon--the downturn may be  somewhat greater  than  the  staff  is  projecting.  Bythe  same  token,  I'm somewhat encouraged by  the  reaction of  some of  thelabor unions  in  the  softening economy and  [by  the  fact  that]  the moneysupply has  been kept  under good control.  So,  I would be  a little moreoptimistic  about how much we might  be able  to do  in  the way ofcontaining  inflation.Now, when we get  to  the  policy issue,  I think  there  are  twoclear  alternatives here.  Everyone recognizes  that we  can't  do muchabout  the  aggregates  issue  [this  year].  But what we do  will make  somedifference  for  next year.  Most  people  have  focused on the  firstchoice,  the  desirability of  maintaining  our  credibility by notappearing to  have  thrown  in  the  towel  by  overreacting and lettinginterest rates  come down  too  fast.  But  that  deals with only one  ofthe  two  credibility problems we  have.  That  one  relates  to  the beliefon  the part  of  a lot  of people  that  generally we've  erred on  the  sideof  ease  [in  the past].  But  there's another  credibility problem  andthat  is  that  we  haven't had a very good record of  hitting our targets.And  that  is  the  one  that  impresses me more.  So,  I'd like  to  focus  onthe  risk that  the  continuation of  the  shortfall  in M1-B might worsenthe  recession and thereby  impede  our efforts  to  reduce  inflation  overthe  longer run.  If  this  downturn is  really serious,  the  pressures aregoing  to  be pretty unbelievable  for us  to  ease later  on.  So,  I wouldfavor  this  second course  of  action.  And if  we do  follow  that,  it'scertainly  likely that  we're going to  have  to  let  rates  fallsignificantly.  I don't  know how far  and no one  else does.  But Idon't  think  the market  would necessarily conclude  that  we have  thrownin  the  towel  if  this  is  the path  that we  follow,  so  long as M1-B  isnot  moving above  what we  set  as  our  long-run target.  So,  that's  theway I would like  to  go.  I'm well  aware  of  the  limitations  of  M1-B;but  even with  its  imperfections,  I believe  it's  a better target  thananything else we  have.  And  that preference  of  mine has beenstrengthened by the  considerable weakness  we've had  in the  economyfollowing  the weakness  in  M1-B.  We've had strong M2  growth  and yetthe  economy has weakened pretty considerably.  So,  my preference  isfor  alternative A, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like  to  alignmyself with comments made  earlier by Governor Schultz  and GovernorGramley.  It  seems clear  to me  that  the weakness  in  the  economy thatwe're  experiencing now is  something that we've been looking  forwardto.  We've  achieved it  and we hope  it  doesn't  go  any deeper.  But it'sa point  at which, if  we make  a mistake with regard  to  interest ratelevels,  in my judgment  our  credibility will  indeed be  in  jeopardy.Let  me  just make  one other  observation.  For  those who have commentedabout  achieving an M1  growth represented by alternatives A, B,  or C,I'd like  to  observe  that  we are  talking about  only  a two-month periodremaining  in  this year.  I believe  Frank Morris  spoke  of adopting  "B"or  "C,"  which  are  somewhat  more restrictive  than what  we  adopted atthe  last  meeting.  At  that meeting we were  looking at  a three-monthperiod,  and the  incoming evidence suggests  that we  cannot  achieve what11/17/81-26-we  set  out  to  do  in  September  or October.  To  try to  do  so  in  theremaining  6 weeks  of  this period would not  be my prescription.I  think the  focus  should now be  on  the  interest  rate  level;to moderate  the  interest  rate  reductions  to  smooth the  transition  intothe  first  quarter  of  1982  is  important.  I would also  observe  that  theinterest  rate  levels  have been reduced  rather  significantly over thelast  60  days;  the  lagged effects  of  those  interest rate  reductions  arenot  clear, but  they  are  significant.  Let me  remind you that  as  of  thefirst  of  September,  for  example,  the  federal  funds  rate was  averagingclose  to  16-3/4  percent;  it's  now  at  13-1/4  percent,  I believe  Petersaid, and  rates  on  short-term governments  have had an even  furtherreduction.  We  don't  know what  the  effects  of  this  will be but  theyshould be positive  on  the economy.  As  a result,  just  to  turn  looseand  let  interest  rates  continue  to  fall  to  achieve an  aggregate  growthtarget  for  the year  over  the  remaining part  of  the year  is  not  what Iwould prefer.I would suggest  a prescription of  alternative  C with an  11  to16  percent  federal  funds  range, a borrowing  level  in  the  neighborhoodof  what  it  is  now, which  I understand  is  about  $350  million.  However,to avoid  the  possibility that  things  might  turn  around  and we  wouldget  much  stronger growth  in the  aggregates  than was  forecast  in  theBluebook,  I'd like  to  suggest  a change  in  the language  of  thedirective.  I'd say growth  of  5 percent  from September  to  December,  assuggested by alternative  C,  "or somewhat  higher,"  thus  acceptinghigher growth  if  it  occurs.  I think the  [chances]  are  that  it willnot  be  that  high.  But  if  it  is  that  high, in  view of  the  past  recordover  1981 we  should accept  it  for  these  last  two months  without movinginterest  rates back up.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Roos.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  If  I were  to  express  a preference  among  the  threealternatives,  I'd  lean  toward  "A" or  "B."  But, as  has been statedbefore,  this  decision  is  a very short-run  decision.  If  what hashappened  in  the past  few months were  to  happen over  the next  twomonths,  regardless  of  whether we  choose  "A,"  "B,"  or  "C,"  we probablywon't  hit our  choice  right  on  the  nose.  So,  I don't  think what we dotoday  is  all  that  important.  I do  think,  though, that what we  do  inour  next  two meetings  is  extremely important,  and  I'd  like verybriefly to  address myself  to  a  couple of  concerns  that  I've  had as  Ihave  listened to  the  discussion  today.First of  all,  regardless  of  the  terminology that  tendssometimes  to  disguise  it,  there  is  significant  sentiment beingexpressed  that we  should  revert  to paying primary attention  tointerest  rate  stabilization.  That was  our practice prior  to  October1979.  This  [view]  is  apparently based  on  some very real  skepticism asto  whether the  aggregates  are meaningful,  whether  they're  definable,and whether  they're  controllable.  I've  heard a  lot  of  people  say thatM1-B  should be discarded because M2  somehow or  other  fits  somewhatbetter  today.  I would remind those people that  if  M2  were really themeaningful  aggregate  and were  growing  as  strongly as  it  has,  wewouldn't be  faced with a problem of  the  slow economy and recessionarycharacteristics  that  we're  facing  today.11/17/81-27-However,  I think  there's  an  even  more  fundamental  concern  aswe  look ahead and  that  is  the  decision as  to  whether or  not we  oughtto  revert  to  our  former practices.  We know that  our mission  is  to  tryto  achieve reasonable price  stability and  to  achieve  steady economicgrowth.  As  some  of you have  said,  it's  not  desirable  to  have  [large]variations  or ups and downs  in  interest  rates.  Well,  I would remindyou  that prior  to  October  of  1979  we spent  precious hours  discussingwhether or  not  interest  rates  should  be  set  1 point or  1/2  pointhigher or lower.  We  attempted to  conduct monetary policy by targetingon  interest rates.  And I would remind you, unless  I misread whathappened, that  when we convened on October  6, 1979,  after  many yearsof  carefully attempting to  guide  the  ship by controlling  interestrates, we were  very concerned  that we had seen  significantfluctuations,  cyclical  and  other  types  of  fluctuations,  in economicactivity and we also were  experiencing shockingly high  rates  ofinflation.Now, even  though we may assume  that  our  efforts  to  controlthe  aggregates have not  been as  fruitful  as  we might have wanted,  ifyou review what has  happened since  1979,  I think you would concludethat  there  is  some  relationship between  the  behavior of  the  aggregatesand price  stability, lagged,  and economic growth.  Compare  the  timeswhen  the  aggregates  grew above  our  ranges and  see whether  or  not  therewas a stimulative effect  on  the  economy a few months afterwards.Indeed,  [consider]  whether  the  slow growth we've had isn't  reflectedsomewhat  in  the present weakness  in  economic  output  that we'reexperiencing.  So,  I would conclude my remarks merely by saying  that  ifwe decide  that  [what  we  did in]  October  '79  was wrong, then  let's  tellthe world  that we're going  to  go back to  where we were prior  tomost  violent upward movement  in the  interest  rate  pattern imaginableand  our credibility would be forever destroyed, because  our Chairmanhas done  a very  effective  job of  convincing people  that we  aredetermined  to pursue this  new course.  But  if  we  start equivocating,if  we  start waffling,  I think we're  in  for  severe problems.  These  aresome  of  the  issues  that perhaps  we will  discuss  in  the next  couple  ofmeetings.  Certainly today there  are  a lot  of  people who would  say:"Let's pitch  out  [the  decision of]  October  '79  and go  back  to  interestrate  stabilization."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  it's  fair  to  say there  aredifferences  in  emphasis.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  That  may be;  I agree with  that.  But  I don'tthink  anybody wants  to--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I think  it's  also  fair  to say  thatequivocation is  in  the  eye  of  the  beholder.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I didn't  say anything  about my preferenceson  the  alternatives  before.  I agree  almost  totally with what  FrankMorris had  to say.  I would choose  alternative  B.  I don't  know thatit's  all  that  important  to  get  a 7 percent  increase  in M1-B inappreciable  increase.  As  you  know, we've  chosen  7 percent  since July.And we've  only had  7 percent  in one  month of  the  months  that  have goneby.  So,  I'm not  really sure  what it  means  when  I say  I'd  like  the  7percent  alternative because  it  may not be  that  at  all.  But  I guesswhat  I'm saying  is  that  if  M-1B  growth  turns  out  to  be  significantlybelow  7 percent--and  significantly below I would define as  being below5 percent--I  would assume  that  we would not  regard  the  federal  fundsrate  range  as  being a  [constraint]  that  would stop  [us  from]  trying  toget more growth.  So,  I'm prepared  to  accept  10  to  15  percent  on  thefederal  funds  rate  range,  as  stated  in  the  directive.  But  if  theaggregates  continue as  weak as  they have been--not what  the  staff  isprojecting, but what  they have  been--I would want  us  to  break below  10percent  on  the funds  rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Solomon.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  I think  the split  among us  is  sharpertoday  than  it  has been  in  a long  time.  It  turns,  really,  on  thequestion  of  how much importance  one gives  to  a moderate,  orderlyabout  the  reaction  in  the bond markets  if  there were  a rapid drop  inthe  fed funds  rate.  There  could be  a very negative reaction  and thismoderate  decline  that  we've been  seeing--and yields  in  bond marketshave  the best  chance  of  influencing  and bringing down mortgage  rates--could be  cut  off  very abruptly  if  markets  see  a precipitous  decline inshort-term money rates.  I think it's  true  that many of  us  here aremore  concerned about  declines  in  [real]  interest  rates when theythreaten  to  drop too  precipitously, in our  judgment,  and becomenegative.  But  I don't  think  there's  anything  inherently  immoral,  letalone  unaesthetic, Nancy, about  asymmetry.  The--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  creates  a very poor economy.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Well,  I'm not  too  sure;  it  depends  onwhere our priorities  are.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  That's  not  the  argument  I heard when  they weregoing up,  either.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  I've  never  argued that  there has  tobe  a mechanistic  asymmetry in conducting  a complicated monetarypolicy.  In any case  it,  I align myself with Fred Schultz,  Lyle11/17/81-29-Gramley, Roger  Guffey, and although he's  somewhat  elliptical,  I thinkJerry Corrigan, Henry, and a  few others.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  I didn't  say anything--

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  You're  just elliptical  looking, Jerry!

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Well,  I've  always been  elliptical  looking!

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I would argue  that  we should havesomething close  to  alternative C,  say 6 percent,  for October  to

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That's  "B."

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  No.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Oh,  for  the  two  months,  October--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Or  5 percent  for  September toformulate  it  that way in  the  directive.  Secondly,  I also  think afunds  rate  range  of  11  to  16 percent makes  sense because we've hadthis  sharp  decline of  about  300  basis points  in  the  fed funds  rate.And if  it  were  to  drop  to  11  percent  from  13-1/4  percent within  theremaining  six weeks  of  this  year,  that's  a very substantial  drop.  Iwould  find it  surprising that  people would want  to  see  it  drop  fasterthan from  13-1/4  to  11 percent  within a 6-week period.  I believe  thatthe  recession will  continue  into early next year  and  that  there willbe further pressures  to  continue  the downward  [trend]  of  rates, whichI think we have  to  accept.  My only point  is  that  [the  decline]  bemoderate  and orderly or  we will  have a perverse  reaction in  the bondof  $350  or  $400  million.  I also  would agree  that  if  growth in  themoney supply comes  in  higher,  we could accept  that.  The disadvantageof  targeting higher monetary growth  is  that  there's  a greaterlikelihood  that we will  get a decline  in  interest rates  at  the  frontend  of  the  period at  a much more rapid rate,  instead  of  spreading  itout  over  a period of  months  in a more moderate way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Before we have  a lot  of  debate back andforth, I think we ought  to  get  through our  list here  with Mr. Boykin.Then we will  attempt to  draw all  these  conflicting  stands  into  happyharmony.

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  I've been  sitting here,  Mr. Chairman,  trying  tobe  sure  I had the  strength  of my convictions.  If  I can  figure outwhat  my convictions  are, maybe  I'll  have the  strength!  I would  liketo  comment very briefly on the economy down  our way, particularlysince  I have  a slightly different  story  to  tell  this  time  around.  Ithink there has been a decided change  in  attitudes  in  the  EleventhDistrict  over  the  last  six weeks.  We  see  weakness  starting to  spreadin our  area.  Of  course,  like  the rest  of  the nation,  retail  sales,autos,  and housing have been  weak  for  some  time.  We  are starting  tosee  some  increased  layoffs  in  the  manufacturing area--in the  aircraftand the  electronics  industries.  Also,  there  are  some  early signs  ofpossible weakness in  the  energy industry.  The  drilling boom seems  tobe  slowing a little.  I'm told  that  one  can actually see  a few rigs11/17/81-30-stacked  in the yards,  and  that  has  not been the  case  for  quite  sometime,  although  the  demand  for  the  deep  offshore rigs  remains  strong.We have  had unusually heavy  rains, particularly  in  the north centralTexas  area,  and  that  is  going  to  cause quite  a bit  of  crop loss,particularly  in cotton  and wheat.  People  are  estimating  a loss  ofabout  $25  million  in  that  area.  Also,  we're beginning to  hearconcerns  expressed about  the possibility of  over-building  in thecommercial area,  particularly in  the  Houston  and Dallas  markets.  Asfar  as  the  staff's  outlook on  the  economy,  that  is  about  the way  Iwould  see  it.  It's  a reasonable  outlook  and  it's  consistent with  whatI'm hearing.On the  policy side,  a very  sharp decline  in  [the  federalfunds  rate]  right now would  cause me  a  lot  of  concern,  particularlyfor  the  implication for  the  long-term rates.  [As  for]  credibility andperceptions,  I think  there's more  likelihood of  serious  criticism  fromthe majority of people  on  the  interest  rate  side  rather  than  on  notmeeting the  stated targets.  Steve's  explanation  of  how alternative Cwas constructed  and what  it's  intended to  do  I  find very persuasive,and  I'll  line up  on alternative  C.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let  me  try  to  summarize  a bit.There  are  some differences  in  emphasis,  but  I'm not sure--we'll  findout--whether  they're  as  great  as  they  appear  to be.Oh,  let  me ask you  a question, a  side  issue,  on  this  energybusiness.  You  say  there are  some  early  signs  of  a much  [less]  rapidincrease at  the  very least.  I've  heard  the view expressed  that  a  lotof  the  activity  currently in  the  energy  area is  based upon anassumption  that  the oil  price  is  going  to be--I'm  trying  to rememberthe  figure  now--$80  or  $90  a barrel  in  the  1990s.  And then  if  thatassumption  is  a disappointment--

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  In real  terms?  In  constant dollars?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  In  nominal  terms.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  In nominal  terms.  Presumably,  they'redoing  the  drilling.  It  isn't  all  that  clear  to me,  but  the point wasthat  the  price  [assumption]  was  high  enough  that  a lot  of  people mightbegin questioning  it.  Do you  have that  feeling?

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  Yes,  that  does  seem awfully high.  On  the otherhand, we get  a  few scattered reports  of  some  shutting  in going on,just  not producing.  They know it's  there  and  ready to  go  but  areholding back because  of  the  supply  side.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  A price  of  $90  a barrel,  if  it's  innominal  terms,  isn't  even  an  increase  in real  terms  if  these  10percent  inflation  forecasts  are  correct.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  May I ask a question  in  line with  that?  As  youpointed out,  most  of  the drilling  going  on  is  deep drilling.

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  That's  natural  gas  drilling?11/17/81-31-

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Is  there  any oil  at  those  [deep]  levels?  Arethey doing  a lot  of  betting on  natural gas  decontrol?  Is  that  [amajor  factor]?

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  Yes,  I think it  almost  has  to be, Fred.  Weheard a report,  and the  Chairman heard it  also,  of  some  deep wellsdown  in  the  Laredo  area where  [it  cost]  about  $4 million to  drill  onewell  and  $8 million  to  drill  another.  As  the  director who wasreporting on  that said,  somebody has to  be  thinking something  that  hewas not  aware of.  I would think  they have  to be  betting on  decontrol.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think  there are  a lot  ofassumptions  in  the gas  business  that  the  price  of gas  is  going  to be$12  or  more  a cubic--

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  MCO.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Foot  or MCO  or  a thousand cubic  feet,whatever  it  is.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Thousand  cubic  feet.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Not  in  the  1990s  but  in  1985  or  1984.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Even under  the present  law, newlydiscovered natural  gas  will be  fully decontrolled by 1985.

MR. GUFFEY.  It  is  today,  I believe,  for newly discovered.But  they have  to  compete with  the  old gas.

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  But  isn't there  still  a question of whetherit's  interstate or  intrastate?

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  It's  my impression that  that's  not  true.  Anynew gas  is--

MR. BOYKIN.  We were  told the  other day by one  energyeconomist  that  there  are  17  different  price  levels  for  gas,  if  you  canbelieve that.  It's  based on all  kinds  of  combinations,  as  you say:the depth,  the  age, whether  it's  going  interstate or  intrastate.  Butthere  are  17  different price brackets.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Is  it  also based on how it  smells?

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The cheating must be  enormous.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm not  even sure what  that  director wasassuming with regard to  $80  to  $90  a barrel.  I think  it  probably wasin  real  terms.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  in  nominal  terms,  10  percent--11/17/81

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  In  ten years,  10 percent  is  nothing.That's  right.  He must  have been  talking in  real  terms.

MR. PARTEE.  [Unintelligible]  is  7 years.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me  just make  one  point.  We  did  anawful  lot of  talking about M1.  It  has  been pointed out by a  couple  ofpeople  that M2  has  been  in the  directive  as  well  and  that  somehow M2wasn't  as reliable because  [its  relatively rapid  growth  implied]  wewouldn't  have had a recession.  I'm not  so  sure  about  that.  Wethought  the M2  range was  very tough and  restrictive when we  adoptedit.  We  thought we'd be  at  the  higher  end of  the  range  if  we werewithin  it  at  all.  I guess  the velocity  of  M2  hasn't  changed much, hasit?  This year  the  assumption was  right  on the  button.  There wasn'tmuch  [change  in]  velocity.  Anyhow, that's  a side  comment.While  I listened to  all  the comments  around the  table,  I havethe  impression  that  there  are some  problems  that  only time will  solveand  I think we have  one  of  those.  I don't  think we  should  suffer  froman excessive  hubris  that  whatever  we do  is  going  to produce  a nice,neat  answer  to  our problems.  A sour  view of  business  is  rather  commonaround  the  table.  I didn't hear  anybody not  express  that.  And  Iheard quite  a few views  that,  when one has  to  look  at  an uncertainworld, the  staff's  projections  are as  good as  any.  There  was  acertain amount  of  talk about  the  risks  on one  side  of  [the  economy]getting worse.  Let's  talk about  the  risks  on  the  other  side of  itbeing better.  I think they exist,  too.  There's  certainly a viewaround--maybe  the most  common view--that  the  economy may not performvery well  in the  short run,  but we're going  to  have one hell  of  arecovery  in  the  second half of  the  year.  A  lot  of  people  are probablyoperating  on  that  basis.  I'm not  saying  that's  the  right  view, but  itis  a view that a  lot  of people  hold.  And that  probably has  someimplications  for  activity.  Currently,  there  is  a risk of  somecumulative difficulty, complicated not  just by normal  kinds  ofcumulative difficulties  in  recessions but by  financial  problems  thatwe  can't  see  very  clearly but may be  there.  We have an  uneasy feelingthey may be  there.I don't  think we can put  a  lot  of  money, speaking  for myself,on any of  these  particular projections.  And while  I agree  that  thestaff  view is  as  logical  as  any, the  range of  dispersion around anyforecast,  I suspect,  is  going to be pretty high.  In any event,  we'vegot  sour business  in  the very short  run.  We  still  have high  inflationexpectations.  I suspect  they may be  improving a  little,  but  I get  thesame  kind of  reports  that Mr.  Boehne commented  on,  and I  thinkinflationary expectations  are going  to  be very  sluggish to  change.Part  of  the  nature of  our problem  is  that  the business  picture canmove  much faster up or  down.  At  the  moment  it  is  down.  Then  someother  things  may change,  such as  inflation and  inflationaryexpectations  and  long-term  interest  rates  in particular  after  allthose markets have gone  through.  That  in  itself means  we're  in  a kindof  no-win situation.  If  we deal  with  the  inflation  and  long-terminterest  rate problem, we  cannot  deal  with  the business  problem;  or  ifwe deal  with the business problem  aggressively, we can't  deal with  thelong-run  inflation, long-term interest  rate problem,  I suspect.  Thereis  no way we  can do  it  with  the limited  tools  that we  have.  We canget  more  relaxed about  the whole  inflation  issue;  I'm not  sure  thatwould help.  But  I'm not  ready  to  go with,  as  Nancy was  suggesting,  a11/17/81-33-basically new approach.  I'm not  going  to  suggest  that  at  the momentand  [that  is]  a little  outside  the range  of  consensus  for  this meetinganyway.How favorably this  will  develop depends not  only on  all  theseuncertainties  about  business  that we  can't  resolve, but  on how fastpeople become more confident  that we  can  get  on an  orderly  long-termpath.  I think  a lot  depends upon wages.  I alternatively get  hopefuland discouraged  about  that  depending upon  the  latest  report.  In  fact,we don't  know much.  But  in  terms  of  financial  dimensions,  it  doesseem  to  me,  in  a sense,  that  the  key  is  how  to  get  long-term marketrates down  and bank rates  down.  Those  are  the  rates  that  are  going  tobe most  important  for  the  economy.  But  it's not  really  just  a problemof  getting  them down;  it's  a problem  of  getting them down  so  they staydown.  I don't  think  any short-term relief  on  interest  rates  is  goingto  mean a thing,  if  they begin bouncing up  again pretty quickly  orwith  any possibility of  that  happening.  And  I'm not  thinkingprimarily in  the  political  terms  that  Fred  Schultz mentioned.  Ourbasic problem  is  how we stimulate  the economy.  That may be  expressedmore happily  at  the moment  as  avoiding  an excessive decline, withoutthe  threat  of  interest  rates moving  right up again  as  soon as  theeconomy levels  off  and shows  some  signs  of  life.  I think there  is  areal possibility  of  a turnaround at  some point;  how  fast  dependspartly  on what we  do.  But  at  this  second--to exaggerate  just  a bit--we're going  to  run into  a stone wall,  assuming  the  kind  of monetarytargets we have  for next  year.  We will  find markets very sensitive toan  increase  in  the  economy or  an  increase  in  the  aggregates, whichnormally accompanies an increase  in  the  economy.  And without  eitherenough experience  with declining inflation  or enough confidence  in  thefuture generally  [unintelligible]  movement,  as  I see  it  at  the moment,from being very abrupt.If  we have a sizable  turnaround in  the  economy in a hurry--expectations  of  a buoyant  economy  and expectations of  higher  interestrates  or whatever--I  don't  think we're  going to  have much  time  for  allthose balance  sheet  adjustments  and  changes  in  behavior  that  arenecessary to  restore more  balance  to  the  financial  system.  And we'llbe  up  against the  same  dilemma  this  year  that we had last  year.  Idon't know  how  indefinitely one can go  into  the  future.  There  is  aquestion of  how confident people  feel  about  the outlook  for  inflation.Not much has  been said  about  the  budget.  The  question  of  theupturn in  interest  rates  after whatever downturn we have  is  going  tobe importantly affected by what people  think  the budgetary outlook  is.That doesn't  look very good at  the moment.  But  I must  say  it's  alsoaffected, at  least  as  importantly, by what people  judge  our  ownbehavior will be--whether we're  going  to  react or  come  out  of  theshoot  in  a hurry the next  time  the money  supply shows  a little  bulgeon  the up  side,  because  that's  the way they are  sensitized to  thinkwe're  going  to behave.  And so  long as  the  monetary growth rate  islow, they are  sensitized to  think interest  rates will  go  down,  andthat's what  is happening.  In  a way, if  we want  to  get  interest  rateslower,  the best  thing  that  could happen  is  to  have  the monetaryaggregates  continue to  look low, because  the minute  they begin  to  lookhigh,  I think  that will  be  the  end of  the  interest  rate  decline, atleast  in  the  long-term market.  In  the  space  of  some months,  I doubtif  that  can be avoided.  If  we were  successful at  the  moment  ingetting a big increase  in  the money supply,  I would not bet very much11/17/81-34-on  long-term rates  coming down--for  a good many months  in  any event.I don't particularly  think that's  going  to  happen.There's  great  difficulty  in  knowing what  the money supply  isat  the moment.  That has  been adequately  discussed.  I would  just makeone other  general  comment  in  reaction  to  what  some people  have  said.I do  think  that we've  had  too much  interest rate  instability  and  toomuch  exchange rate  instability.  If  this  persists  into  the  future  inthe  range  that  has occurred  in  the  past  couple  of years,  at  some pointwe're going  to  shake  these  financial  markets apart  so much  that  nobodywill  know where  in  the  world they stand and  a  long-term  investmentwill  be  three  days.  That's  not very encouraging, particularly withregard  to  the  long-term  interest  rate problem that  we  have.Something  occurred to  me  during  the  discussion when FrankMorris  accused--if  that's  the  right word--Steve Axilrod  of  sayingsomething  I don't  think was  in  Steve's mind.  But  let  me say  that  Idon't  think  it's  so  bad if  it  was  in  Steve's mind, because  it'ssomewhat  in my mind.  We  get a natural  force  toward moderation ofmonetary growth when we get  downward  forces  in  the  economy.  We  get  acertain  natural  push upwards  on the  money supply when the  economy  isbeginning  to  expand.  And  if we  literally  [evened off]  the moneysupply  through  those demand  forces,  we'd have a violent  change  ininterest  rates.  I don't  see  that  there's any way  to  avoid  it.  Let mecome  back  to Lyle's  point  about  how violent  a change  in interest  rateswe want  and whether we really are  achieving anything.  I don't  thinkthat  calls  into  question  in  a  fundamental  way the  trend of  monetarygrowth  over  time.  What  it  does  call  into  question  is  how hard weshould  fight  against  essentially cyclical  movements  in demand  forceson  the  money  supply.  When we get  these  waves  in  the money supply, wehave  lots  of  problems  explaining ourselves  to  the  iron-cladmonetarists  in  the part  of  the market  that's  [persuaded]  by that  kindof  argument.  But  I don't  think it  is  or  fundamentally has  to  beinterpreted as  a departure  from  the  general  idea  that we've got  to  geta  lower trend.  It's  not  a question of  how much cyclical  amplitude  weallow around  the  trend.  We don't  allow  any  cyclical  amplitude  that'sgoing to  raise  questions  among the  questioners.  But  one has  to  askwhat  the  lesser  evil  is.In  any event,  getting down  to  the nub of what we have  towriting a directive  that people  can understand and agree with.  ButI'm not  sure--we'll  find  out--how  far  apart we  really are.  I thinkwhat we're  debating  is  the  aggressiveness,  in a  sense, with which wemove  to  push the money  supply up  or deal  with weakness,  if  that's whatwe're  going to  have.  I don't  think  I really hear  anybody saying  thatwe shouldn't  move  in  the  direction of  easing bank reserve positionsand be prepared  to  see  some  decline  in  interest rates  if  the  moneysupply is  on  the  weak side.  I don't  think  I hear  anybody saying  thatif  the money supply took  a  little  jump, we  should be  sitting  hereresisting  it  in  any sense.  Having said  all  that, we need  to  quantifywhat we  mean and how we  express  it.  It's  almost  easier  to  talk  interms  of  the  operational  variables  rather  than  the  targets  themselves,recognizing that  the  actual movement  in  the  money supply over  the  nextfew weeks probably  is  not  going  to  be affected much by what  we do  andwe'll  have  to  take  the  figures  as  they come.  Some  consistency in ouroperations  as  we  set  them now--not  knowing what  those  money supplyfigures  are  going to be--with  further  declines  in  interest  rates  of  a11/17/81-35-moderate character  doesn't bother me.  I think  that's probablyappropriate  in  all  the  circumstances.  I would think that  meanssomething  like  a $350  million  figure  for borrowing or  $400  million, orsomeplace  in that  area.  We'd be prepared to  move down on  that  if  themoney supply is  weak and not prepared to move up  on  it  if  the  moneysupply  is  strong unless  [it's  extremely  strong].  But  I can't conceiveof  it being  strong  enough so  that we'd want  to move  [borrowing]  up,frankly.  But  we would have  to  be prepared, I think,  to move it  downsomewhat  if  the money supply remained weak.Just  how to define weakness  is  going  to  be  an  issue.  We havehad the pattern recently of a 5-point band  in the  federal  funds  raterange.  It's  an  artificial contrivance  in many ways  at best because  ifwe put  a 5-point band on  any of  these  numbers  I'm not  sure  anybodysitting here would want  to  think  of  the  federal  funds  rate going up  to15  or  16  percent as  some of  these  [Bluebook alternatives  show].  Incurrent circumstances  the  rate probably  is  not going  to go  up at  allsignificantly from where  it  is  for  any length of  time.  It  is  slightlyover  13  percent now.  I suppose,  on the  convention we've used in  thepast,  that would make  the  range  10-1/2  or  11  percent  to 16  percent  orsomeplace  in  that  area;  but  the  upper part of  that  range  isn't  veryrelevant.  I'm sure  that  this  feeling would not be unanimous, butthere  is  a considerable  amount  of  feeling that we'd want  to take  avery hard look at  this  if  the  rate  got  down toward  the  lower  end ofthe  range, as  it  well  could.  It  is  probably not  apt to  do  that  unless[the  Board]  reduces  the discount  rate  in the  near term.  I think thediscount  rate  is  clearly going  to  be in question during  this periodand should be  in question in  terms  of  a downward movement.  I think wewould assume that  that move might well  come  sometime before  the nextmeeting, unless  there  is  quite  a change  in  the business picture.  Whenone  thinks  in those  terms, we  could begin getting down toward  thosefunds  rates  quite  easily but probably  after a period of  time.  Thediscount rate isn't  going to  be moved right away.  Now, as  to how toformulate  the  actual  directive,  I think basically we have  two  choices:We  can put  in  a relatively  low number and say we're not bothered  ifit's higher;  or we can put in  a relatively high number  and say we'renot  bothered if  it's  lower.  Maybe we  could have  a little morediscussion  of  those options.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Well,  I've  said my piece on  the  interest  rateissue.  I'm not  bothered by the  fed  funds  rate  getting down below 10percent, but  not between now and the next meeting.  I would go withthe  idea  of  a target  and then  say  "or somewhat  lower."  My choicewould be alternative B with initial  borrowing at  $350  million and afederal  funds  range  of  11  to  16  percent.  It's basically  "B,"  but witha different  funds  rate  [range].  After all,  that's  a consultationpoint.  I think we  ought  to  consult  if  it  gets  [to  11 percent];remember, the  next FOMC meeting is  only 5 weeks  away, so  it's  a veryshort  period of  time.  I suspect,  as  I said yesterday, that we'regoing to  have  to move  that  basic  discount rate pretty soon.  And Iwould have some  concern about  the  rate  going  [down]  faster  than  that,which is  why I say 11  to  16  percent.  I'd have some  concern about  theborrowing getting down any  lower  than  $200  million during  this periodof  time.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I buy the  $350  million and  I buy the  "B"[specifications]  but  I would want  the  funds  rate at  10  to  15  percent.I certainly can't  imagine it  over 15  percent,  and I would want us  to11/17/81-36-consult very promptly  if  10  percent  is  going  to  hold us  up  and wewould not  have a good growth  in  the money supply.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Incidentally, I'd be  willing to  go  11  percentwith 15  percent  on the  top  end;  the  only problem is  that  it's  only a4-point  range.  I don't  think we're  going to  hit  that  [upper  limit]anyway.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  No.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I had  Steve draft  a couple  of  alternativedirectives.  Let me read  them  to  make  sure  I understand them  first.Well,  let  me just  try this  on  you.  The  concept  is  simple  enough;  thelanguage can be worked on,  obviously.  One option  follows  a practicewe have used  at  least  once  and maybe more  than  once,  and I  think  it'sa good practice unless we  have to  deviate  from  it  because  it  doesn'tsound  like  so much fine-tuning.  It  starts  with  exactly  the  samedirective  that we had  at  the  last  meeting, but  it puts  it  in  the  pasttense,  so  to  speak.  It  says  that  at  the previous  meeting we decidedon  7 percent  and 10  percent,  [respectively as  the  quarterly targetsfor M1-B  and M2].  Then  "In reviewing these  quarterly targets,  theCommittee  felt  that  shortfalls  in  growth would be  acceptable  if  theyare  generally consistent with  phasing into  the  tentative monetarygrowth  targets  set  for 1982  and as  they may occur  in  the context  ofrange.  So,  it  says  in effect:  This  is  the  target  we had set  for  thequarter;  we recognize we  set  it;  it  looks  like we're  low and we'llaccept  the  shortfall provided  interest rates  are declining;  and we'renot  too  unhappy with the  shortfall  in  the  light  of  phasing into  nextyear.The  other  option, presumably, would be  consistent  with doingsomething  like  "C."  We'd put  in  those numbers  for the  next  twomonths,  but  say a  somewhat  higher growth  rate would be  acceptable asconsistent with the  quarterly  target set  at  the  previous  meeting andjust  repeat  the  targets  of  the  previous meeting.  That doesn't  sayanything about--.  What  I was  looking  for  was whether there's  anyinterest  rate  allusion  in  that  one.  There  is  not,  I guess.  But  inthat  one we put  in  the  low number and  say we're perfectly happy toraise  it  to  where we  set  it  at  the  last  meeting.  The other says  thatwhat we  said at  the  last meeting is  okay, but we're happy with ashortfall  [in money growth]  if  interest  rates  are declining, and  it'slogical  for  moving into next  year anyway.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  What  if  you're  not happy with a shortfall?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  you're not  happy with any  shortfall,you're  not  going to  be happy with  either  of  these  formulations becausethey both  are  low.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That's  my reaction.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  What if  you're not  happy with next year'stargets?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  if  you  really want  it  much higher--if  you want  a 7 percent  target  next year--then you wouldn't buy  thisone.  But  I think all  it's  saying basically is  that  the number  is11/17/81-37-something less  than 7 percent.  It's more  consistent with what  we'retentatively thinking about  next year  than 7 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Why does  7 percent  for  the next  [5]  weeks  meanthat we  favor 7 percent  growth next year?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  doesn't.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  I didn't  think  so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  doesn't  say we  favor 7 percent growthnext year.  What  it  says is  that  if  we  have  7 percent growth--.  Well,the  thought  expressed around the  table  by a number of  people was  thatif we push hard  for  large growth now, then we will have  to  slow itdown next year, and  that  may be undesirable.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We  will have  a lot  of  shortfall  to  make  up,though, when we get  into next year.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Well,  we  still have--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It  may not  be as  clear as  I was  trying  to  makeit.  The 7 percent was  for  the  quarter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  that's  for  the quarter.  This  is  justrepeating what we  said at  the  last meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Last meeting we  said we'd like the  quarter  tobe  this way.  The  operative  sentence  says we're  going  to  accept  theshortfall  from that  so  long  as  interest  rates  are  declining, whichcould mean  that  7 percent  over  the next  two months would be  ashortfall  from the  7 percent  for  the  quarter.  It  wouldn't preclude avote  from  a Committee  member who favored that.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  But  it's  open  [ended].  It  could get  to  zerowith  interest  rates  declining.  It  still  seems  to  me a  test  of  thedirective.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I was  trying  to  say that  you wouldn'treally like  it  much below where you were  going into next  year.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  We have  a smaller--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  What  is  "some  shortfall"?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Chuck,  we  have  to  give  some verbalguidance on  how much of  a shortfall  is  acceptable.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well, we better have  it  in  the  directive becauseit  sounds as  if  it  could be  zero  or minus  10 percent  as  long asinterest  rates were  declining.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  That's why a shortfall--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We've used language  of  this  sort before,Chuck.  That's  ridiculous,  if  I may say  so.11/17/81-38-

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It's  not  ridiculous  because we're  7 percentagepoints  off  our  expectations on  average  for  the  last  six months.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We are not  when you  take  account  of M2.That's  just  wrong.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I  thought M2  was  below--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  M2  is  still  in  this  directive.  M2,  infact,  is  currently projected  to  be on  target.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I agree with Chuck, but  for  differentreasons.  My concern  is  that  the markets will  assume that  we mean  onlya very modest  shortfall  if  we  say a  shortfall will  be  accepted.Secondly,  I'm concerned about  the  [possible]  interpretation of  thecaveat  about  declining rates.  We'd have  to  say at  least  an  "orderly"we're pushing gung-ho  for  that.  I think on  balance  there's  lessdanger  of misinterpretation  if  we  use  the  other  alternative--if we putin  something  like  alternative  C  and say we will  accept  something lowerthan  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  are you going to  do  in yourconception  if  growth  comes  in  less  than  alternative C?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Then the  fed  funds rate  is  going  togo  [down]  until  we change  it.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  I have been  thinking about  alternativedirective  formulations  this morning,  too.  I must  say  I struck outbecause of  the very problems  we're running into  here already.  Mypreference  at  this  point would be  to  have  the  directive  state  theaggregate numbers  for  October  to  December  that are  in  alternative Cwith  the  language  "or somewhat  higher"  with borrowings  at  $350  to  $400million.  I could accept  combining that  formulation with a  federalfunds  rate  of  10  to  15  percent,  simply because  I think  it's  going  tobe  hard to get  the  aggregates  specifications even  in alternative  C,given  the  economy.  But  I do  think that  kind of  language  formulation,notwithstanding Frank Morris's  concerns,  is  more prudent  and  safer  interms  of  people understanding what we're  doing.  And obviously,  if  theaggregates  were  soft,  we still  would have  the  opportunity  to  use  theconsultation procedure to make  further  judgments  as we  go  along.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  I had  Frank down  for  "A."  Are  you  saying youagree with Frank?

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  No.  I said notwithstanding  his  concern abouthow to  explain why we're now  at  5-3/4  percent  instead of  7 percent.  Ithink that  can be  dealt with.  No,  I'm talking  about  "C"  or  somewhathigher  and, as  I  said, I could  go  with  10  to  15  percent  for  the  fundsrate  band simply because I think  it's  going to be  hard to hit  any ofthese  things.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  I would  join in  that,  except  that  for  thefederal  funds band I would prescribe 11  to  16  percent  simply becauseof  the  shortness  of  the  horizon;  we're  [only]  looking at  the next  [5]weeks.  If  the  funds  rate  drops  to  the  tune  of  another  2-1/4 points,that  is  close  to  being a precipitous  drop over  the  last  three  months.11/17/81-39-

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  That's  my preference,  too.  I'm saying  I couldlive with  it.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Oh,  I see.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I would agree with Roger,  and I would preferthe  11  to  16  percent.  I do  think  the alternative  formulation,  thefirst  one  that  you read,  is  awfully  fuzzy.  It's  sufficiently  fuzzythat  I don't  know whether anybody would know exactly what we'retalking about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Unlike the  other  one?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I would prefer  alternative B just  as  it  iswritten.  I don't  know how many others  feel  that way.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I would prefer  alternative B with the  10  to  15percent.  I think there  is  a real problem  of  perception in  that  itlooks  as  if  we've tightened monetary policy at  the wrong time  if  we gowith the  5-3/4  percent  target  for M1-B.

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  I would prefer  to  see  alternative A,  but  I'd bewilling  to  accept  the  money growth  figures  for alternative  B with  theborrowing at  $200 million  and a  federal  funds band  from  9 to  14percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  $200  million  is  awfully low as  a start  forborrowing.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  I'm willing to  do  that.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I prefer  alternative  B with a  funds  range of  10to  15  percent and an  initial  borrowing level  of  $350  million.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  I'm  concerned in  formulating this directive, Mr.Chairman,  that  it  certainly will  appear odd  that we have  adopted thealternative C specifications  at  a time  when we  know  the  economy isworse.  And  that  leads  me  to  join  those who  have  spoken up  in  favor  ofalternative B.  It's a minimum of  what  I'd  like  to  see.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Mr. Chairman, no  one has  really  [addressed]  FrankMorris'  point about what  has  happened since  the  last  meeting tojustify making  our  targets more  [restrictive]  than  they were.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  A big decline  in  interest rates  and ashortfall  in  M-1B  in  October.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  I don't  think that  justifies  it.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  The  shortfall  in  October  is  the  easiest  one  inthe world to--

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  I don't  think that  justifies  anything.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I may have  to  agree, but you asked me  whatjustifies  it.11/17/81-40-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I think Tony  is  absolutely right.  We've  nowit's  very hard to bring  them  together.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Can't we  to  some  extent  cover  the problem ofappearing to  be  tightening by  commenting about moving  into  next year?Consistent  with what you  said, we could  say we are positioningourselves by  this  particular  choice  to  move  into  the band that  we willselect  for  next year.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  That will  scare  the market  out  of  its  mind ifyou do  that because  they would interpret  it  to mean that  we're headingagain  for  the  lower  end of  the  range next  year.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  No,  I'd say we  would be positioning  ourselves  tomove  into  the band that  we  will  select  for  next year.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I don't  like  next year's  targets;  I thinkthey're  too  low.  I hate  to commit  myself  to  them;  it  gets  to  thepoint  that  we can't  do  anything  about them  in  February.  We'resupposed  to  take  a new  look at  them  in February.  This  freezes  us  inconcrete as  to  what we're  going to  do  for  next  year's  target.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's  what you've  said all  along.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  do  we have  any  other  comment?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  I'm concerned mostly about  thepossibility of  the  funds  rate  falling below the  discount  rate  and ofvery low borrowing.  Then  things  could get  out  of hand and confront uswith  the  need to  keep  lowering  the discount  rate  in  order  to  preventthat.  For  that  reason,  I would start  off with a  [relatively high]borrowing  assumption and  I would  like  to  consult  at  a  somewhat higher[funds  rate]  level  on  the way down.  Consulting doesn't  mean that  onestops  there.  But  at  least  at  a  time  when much higher  mobility ofinterest  rates  is  a possibility, we  ought  to  look  at  it  earlier ratherthan  later.  So,  I would go  for  $400  million  for borrowing  and  12  to16  percent  on  the  funds  rate without  any expectation that  it would goto  16  percent.  But neither  would I like  it  to  drop  below 12  percentwithout  talking about  it.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  I'm  concerned about  the appearance  of  setting agoal.  Maybe  I have  a problem with understanding  the philosophy  ofthese  statements  even after  hearing them  discussed so  often.  As  Iunderstand  it,  the  philosophy when we set  a target  is  that  it  is  atarget  and we  may not  always  achieve  it.  We  have a problem nowbecause we've been underachieving both the  short-run and the  long-runtargets  on  one of  the  things we  look  at,  M1-B.  Were we  to put  out adirective  that  appears  to  have  set  tighter  targets  as  we're  facing  theprospect  of  what may be  a very serious  recession,  starting  from  adisastrously low  level  of  economic activity  in major  industries  suchas  housing  and autos,  we  could  scare  the  devil  out  of  everybody byhaving people perceive  that we're  trying  to  be very tight.  So,  theconcern  and all  the  talk about  how to  couch this  is  very  important.I'd be  inclined to  err  on the  side  of  staying with  the  target  that  weband again but  allowing  it  to  have a  little more  leeway  on the downside.  I'd go with something  more like  Emmett  Rice's  prescription  of  a11/17/81-41-"B+"  or  "A-" type  prescription, with  a borrowing assumption of  perhapsa quarter billion dollars  or  somewhere  in  that  range  and a wide  fundsrate range.  If  I counted right,  4 or  5 times  earlier  this year we  seta 6-point  range.  Why not  set  a  6-point  range of  9 to  15  percent,  sortof  centered on where we  are now and allow ourselves  a little moreleeway?

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  That  9 to  15  averages  12,  not  13-1/4 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The basic  problem we're  dealing with  is  arepetitive problem.  We are  setting a target  for  the  next  six weeksand nothing we  do  here  is  going to  affect what  those numbers  are overthe next  six weeks.  We have  to  have a little  longer  perspective.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  You're  right.  There's only  a difference  of  $2billion in  M1-B  on  "A,"  "B,"  and  "C." change we've had on the  last  two  Fridays.It's  less  than  the  amount  of

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  But  that  argues more  for  the  appearance  of  itand  that we  stay with the  7 percent.  I agree with you that  nothing wedo  is  going to  affect what  happens over  the  next  six weeks.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  We all  agree  on that.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  So,  the whole  question is  what  the market  [willthink].  If  they  think we're  tightening--

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I would still  stay with  "C" the  way it'sprescribed with a borrowing assumption  of  $350  million.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know.  We're not  going to  resolvethis  before  lunch.  I guess I come back more  strongly to my gutfeeling  that we're better  off  not  horsing around with  the  target  thatwe  set  last  quarter  in  a formal  statement.  But  I'd clearly admit  thatwe  are prepared  to  see  a shortfall  under certain  conditions.  It  seemsto  me we clearly  are.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  And  that we  wouldn't be  surprised.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  I think  that's more  like  it.  It's  not thatwe're willing to  see  a shortfall but we  expect  that  it's  going  tohappen.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think that's  about  the  same assaying we're willing.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Maybe we  should simply say  there areonly six weeks  left  to  go  and there's  no point  in--

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Is  it  the difference between  [desiring]  andaccepting?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  What we do  in  the next  6 weeks will  impact whathappens  to  the  money supply in  the  first  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  That's right.  The world doesn't  stop.11/17/81-42-

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  We buy a  little more  insurance  that  the moneysupply  is  not going  to  fall  out of bed.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  The next  six weeks  matters,  too,  if  we  getborrowings  down  to whatever  that  frictional  level  is.  I agree withGovernor  Schultz;  I have a hunch  that  the  frictional  level  ofborrowing is  higher  than Steve was  suggesting,  although I can't  besure.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I happened  to  look  back at  the data,President  Corrigan, and  it  might be  of  some  interest  to  the Committeethat  in  June  and July  of  last  year  the  level  of  adjustment plusseasonal  borrowing--and I think  the  funds  rate  ran a  little  below thediscount rate  at  times  in  that  period--came out  [in millions  ofdollars]  at  104,  34,  127,  44,  75,  20,  121,  and  145  for 8 straightweeks  in  June and July.  So,  it  can run quite  low.  There's  noguarantee,  but  it  can  run  quite  low.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Look what  happened  in August  and  September.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  borrowing  sort  of  goes  up.  It  doesn'tgive  you  any  scope  for  shortfalls  in  required reserves  because youcreate  large  excess reserves.  That  can happen.  That's  the  danger.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  The  question  though,  Steve,  is:  When we  firsthit  that  frictional  level what happened  to  the  funds  rate?  That'swhat gets  me  concerned.  There's  a point  at which  the drop  in  thefunds  rate  gets very rapid  in  that  kind of  period.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  That's  only, Governor  Schultz,  if  this  so-called  frictional  level,  which might happen in any event,  is  alsoaccompanied by a very sharp rise  in excess  reserves.  Then  the  fundsrate  could drop very substantially.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Did that  happen  in  those weeks  that youmentioned last  year?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  No.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me  talk  a  little  less  theology and alittle more practically at  the  moment.  Suppose we  start at  $350million as  an assumption.  Make  the  figure  a rounder  number and startat  $400  million, Mr. Axilrod.  In  the ordinary course  of  events, youset  a nonborrowed reserve path.  You  start  it,  just  as  an assumption,at  $400  million  and you will put  in a growth path  for M1-B.  Let megive you  two hypotheses  for that  growth path you put  in  for M1-B:  Oneis  6 percent,  just  to  keep  the numbers  round, which  is  close  to  "C;"and  for  the other  extreme,  say,  8-1/2  percent, or  round that down.Now,  if  the  money supply  comes  in  around 6 percent,  the borrowingswould remain  at  $400  million or  whatever  the  [initial]  level  is,  if  weadopt  "C.  Presumably,  that's  what would happen.  If  we put  in the[higher]  number  on  the  basis  of  "A" and  the money  supply  comes  in  atthat  same  6 percent,  how much would the  borrowing  level  go down?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  roughly it  would be  $200 million  lower  onthat,  having  started  the path  at--11/17/81-43-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  would be $200  million  lower by  thelatter part  of  December?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  I was  looking  at  a monthly average, but  itwould be  in  that  area  in  December.  It's  $2 billion divided by  10,roughly.  It's not  quite precise.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  the  range  of what  we are  talkingabout in  nondiscretionary action.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  What  does  that  $200  milliondifference mean  in  terms  of  the  implied  fed  funds  rate?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  sometimes  it  means nothing.  One of  ourrules  of  thumb has  been 25  basis points  per  $100  million;  another hasbeen  20  basis  points.  They've all  been wrong at  various  times.  So,one  could  say  somewhere between  40  and  50  basis  points  is  representedmerely by that.  But,  as  the Chairman has  said, misses  in  money  supplyare  often much  larger  than this  little  range.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  I think  I am  saying, in practice,  isthat we might  set  that path, depending  upon where we  start  it,  closeto  the  "A" specification;  we're probably not  going to  be very quickabout making discretionary upward adjustments  in  the path  if  theshortfall  is  anywhere within the  range  of  "A" to  "C."  We mightconsider  one if  it  came in  at  3 percent or  less.  It  depends on whathappens  in M2  and all  the rest,  but  that's  what we're  talking about.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  You have practically no room  for  discretionaryupward adjustments  in nonborrowed  reserves because even under  thecircumstances you  have  cited--and remember we  set  a monthly  average--if  we're  3 points  off,  we're down  to  the  frictional  level  of  borrowingby  the  end of  the  period.  So  there  is  no  room to  have  an  upward--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  There's not a lot of  room;  that's right.And that's why we're  talking about  relatively small  numbers here.  Wehaven't  got  a lot  of  room unless we  really wanted to  push  extremelyhard.  Precisely, we don't have much  room.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  I'm not  sure what you said.  Did you sayconstruct  a path on  "A" or--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that  is  one alternative  one couldtake.  But we would not be  very quick about  making discretionaryadjustments.  It  depends upon where we  start  off or what  people  thinkabout  this.  If  we  start off  at  $400 million  and  it  fell  to  "B" or  "C"or  a little  less,  we're going  to  end up with  $200  million.  If  it  fellmore  sharply  than  that  to  well below  "C,"  we're  going to  end up at  alower  level and we may run into  the  federal  funds  rate constraint.That's what  the  operational  decision is.  Now, if  we  set  it  up  theother way,  it  depends upon where we  set  the  initial  level  ofborrowing.  In  either  case,  I think we're  saying  that  if  it  runsabove, we  don't  do  a thing--we accommodate  it--which we've done  oftenin the past.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  The way you  stated  it,  isn't  really theoperative question how fast we want  to  get  to  that  frictional  level  ofborrowing?  If  we  started with  $400  million  and a  6 percent path as11/17/81-44-distinct  from  $400  million  and an  8 percent path,  doesn't  theoperative  question  then  reduce  to  how  fast  we want  that  borrowinglevel  to  get  down to  whatever  that  frictional  level  is?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  that's  the  operative  question.And we're  talking about  a very narrow range.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  So,  the  real  policy issue  is  the  onewe  discussed:  Do  we want a more rapid  rate of  decline in  the  earlypart,  that  is,  in  the  next  few weeks,  or  do we  want  to  stretch  it  outand have a more moderated rate  of  decline?  If  we  go  for  "A,"  we'retaking  a bigger  risk  that we  will have  the pressure  earlier.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  depends  upon where we  set  the  initialborrowing.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Well,  I'm  assuming  the  same  range  of$350  to  $400  million.  If  you  construct  the nonborrowed reserve pathon  "A" rather  than  "C,"  then  there's  a greater risk  that  we'll  get  thedownward pressure  earlier  and  to  a  larger  degree.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  moves  in  that  direction.  We're  talkingabout very  small  numbers  in  the  next  three  or  four weeks  or  so.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Yes.  I accept  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The most  important  thing  is  where we  setthe  initial borrowing.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  And where the discount  rate  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  discount  rate will be  an  importantconsideration in where  the market  [goes];  in  fact,  that's  going  to  bemore  important  than  this  other  thing.  I'm afraid  that  the only  twothings  that  are going  to make  any real  difference here,  in  the  rangethat  anybody  is  talking about,  are  if  somebody says  we want  to  go allout  and make  sure we're going  to  hit  7 percent M-1B  growth and weought  to  start with  zero  borrowings.  Then we'd be  talking about  avery different  kind of  approach.  But with  the  initial  borrowing  levelsomeplace  in  the  range  that  we're  talking  about,  these  otherdifferences  are going  to be minuscule  in a mechanical  application ofthis  [directive].  What  is  going to make  the  difference  is  if  and howquickly  the  discount  rate  is  changed  and whether we make adiscretionary adjustment  as we  go  along.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  You wouldn't  see  the borrowings  going above$400  million?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I wouldn't  see  the borrowings  going above$400  million under  any conceivable  conditions  that  I can  imagine  overthe  next  five  weeks.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Unless  you lower  the  discount  rate  by about  3 or  4percentage points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  if  we  adopted a whole  different kindof  strategy, but barring a deliberate  counter movement  on  the  discountrate--11/17/81-45-

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  You're  assuming  the discount  rate will  go  downto  around  12  percent  during this  period  of  time?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm assuming  that  is  quite possible.  Iwill not make any premature assumptions.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  It  depends  on what  [the  Reserve  Banks]  recommendto  [the  Board].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  we  see both  continuing weakness  inbusiness  and continuing weakness  in  the  aggregates,  I think that wouldbe a reasonable  assumption.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  I would still  argue  that  if  we're  going  to  getthere,  I'd rather get  there  in  an orderly way.  I would start  offconstructing the path  off  6 percent with  the borrowings  at  $400million  and if  we have  to  adjust, we  have  to  adjust.  But  I would wantto  get there  in  a deliberate,  orderly way if  we have  to  get  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What you're  saying,  "in a deliberate,orderly way" makes  a difference  of  maybe  $25  million in borrowings  inthe  second week  in  December.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  I don't know.  I'm not  sure  I agree with  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Is  that wrong, Mr. Axilrod?

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  My concern  is  getting  into  the  realm  of  thisfrictional  level  of  borrowings.  I'm not  sure  I know what  it  means,but  in my own mind's  eye  I have  to  leave room  for  the possibility  thatgetting  there  could result  in  a situation where we would get  a buildupin  excess  reserves  and  the  federal  funds market would really  fallapart.  That may be an outlier  concern, but  I have  it.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I share  Jerry's views  all  the  way.  I could buythe  idea  of  keeping a 7 percent path  instead of  a 6 percent  path  andputting in a contingency  clause  to  the  effect  that  an overrun wouldnot be resisted in  any way.  But  the  idea  of  too  disorderly a drop  ininterest  rates  at  this  point  is  the most  important  thing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think you're  focusing on  the wrongthing.  That's  going  to be more affected by the way we  set  the  initialborrowing assumption  than  the mechanical  thing  that  falls  out  of  this.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I agree.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  In  a 4-week period.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  The appearance matter  that  Nancy mentioned is  theone  that keeps  coming up  in my mind.  If  this  reads  that we  tightenedthe  bands  for  the  aggregates  and we did not  lower  [the  funds  raterange]--we're at  12  to  17  percent now and you say we're  going to  go  to11-1/2  percent  or  stay at  12  percent, as  a number of people haverecommended--it's going  to  come  off  that  the  economy is  crashing downand the  Fed is  cheering it  on, possibly.  Possibly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Where  is  [the  bottom of  the  range]  now, at12  percent?11/17/81-46-

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  The range  is  12  to  17  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  The  range  is  12  to  17  percent  and  if  you're  sayingwe are not  even  going  to  lower the  range--

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  But  the  range really  doesn't mean  that  it'sbeing held  there.  It's  a checkpoint  for  consultation.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Only  on  the way up.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  has worked extremely well.  Well,  I  thinkborrowing  a little  higher  for  safety.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, we're  in  a very narrow range  here.I have  a strong  feeling within the narrow range  that  we've  discussedhere.  All  I'm  trying  to  do  is  make  the  point  that  if  we have  toconstruct  a reserve path, and  that's what we're  talking about,  thedifference  between  "A" and  "C" at  the  extremes  is  not  an  immediateone;  once  we've  set  the  original borrowing  assumption,  it  can't  changejust mechanically  by more  than  $25  or  $50  million  a week unless  themoney supply  really  falls  out  of  bed.  It  would be  changed because  themoney supply fell  out  of  bed not  because  of  the  difference  in  theassumption;  there's  only going  to  be  a  $50  million  difference  in  early

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That  is  something  I want  to  guard against.  Itmight not  fall  out  of bed, but  then  it  might  fall  out  of bed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Oh,  if  it  does,  then  the  borrowing  isgoing  to  come down.  But  it  doesn't make  any difference whether  wepick  "A,"  "B,"  or  "C." are  going  to  go way down.  That would be because  the money supply wentdown, not  because we picked  "A,"  "B,"  or  "C."If  the money  supply is  negative, borrowings

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  If  we  had borrowing  at  $400  million  and  then  setthe  reserve path on  7 percent  for  October  through December  and had afunds  range  of,  say,  to  10  to  15  percent or  even  11  percent  tosomething, I  think that would  take  care  of  the  appearance  problem inthe  directive  as  well  as  give us  an approach  on--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  But  I do  believe  that  it's  probably when thefunds  rate  breaks  that we will really get  the  system  to  generatemoney.  Because  then  the banks  can't  nicely  lend  their  federal  funds;they've  got  to  get  out  there and do  something else.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think that  kind of  break  comes  below 10  or  11percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  would come with a break in  the  money supply,which would  force  these rates  down.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Chuck,  if  we move  in your directionto  the  7 percent  for  October  to December--I  don't mean September,[but]  October  to  December--would you  accept  a  funds  rate  range  of  11to  16  percent?11/17/81-47-

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I don't want  a  top of  16  percent.  I think thatjust  looks  absolutely ridiculous.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I must  say that  looks  a little  foolish tome.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I think  then  it would be  a question  of whetherwe want to  narrow it  to  11  to  15  percent.  I might accept  that.  Thereare  others who wouldn't.  I think  the  biggest  thing is--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Why do  we  have  to  keep the  funds  raterange  at  5 points?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Because we don't  want  it  to  seem constraining.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  But  everybody  knows  that  the  up  sideis  academic  anyway  in  the  next  five  weeks.  So,  why couldn't  it  be  11to  15  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Because  then  it  will be perceived that  in  the  lastthree  meetings we've closed  in  on  interest  rate management.  We wouldhave gone  from a 6-point  spread to  a 4-point  spread  and the  chargewill  raised that  we're managing  interest  rates.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  That's  the way it's  going to  look.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I could buy Ed's  formulation of  $400  millionand 7 percent with a 10  to  15  percent  federal  funds  range.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I think maybe that's what  we ought  to  settle  on.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I have  a feeling maybe we  ought  togo  to  lunch and settle  it  after  lunch.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Good idea.  When  in  doubt, punt.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we'll  have  a quick lunch.[Lunch  break]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let  me  consider  the numbers, with  an unduedegree  of  technicality, because we're  in a very narrow band.  I don'tthink  there's much disagreement here  on these  details;  whether theywill work out  or  not  is  another question.  Let me  just  get  clear  in mymind again what  I asked you before.  The difference,  going all  the wayto  the  extreme, of  something  like  an  8-1/2 percent  growth  rate and a 6percent  growth rate  just  in  setting the  reserve paths  is  going to  be$2 billion,  did you  say?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  The difference  is  roughly  $2 billion  inand the  lowest  one  turns  out  to  be what  actually happens,  then  theaverage  level  of  borrowing--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  don't  make the  lower  one whatactually happens.  That's  where we're  setting  the path theoreticallynow.  We don't  know what  is  going to  happen yet.  That's  the nextquestion I'll  ask.11/17/81-48-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  All  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Your  path would be  $2 billion higher  in

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  With  "A" than with  "C"?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  The  level  of  the  money supply, M1-B, under  "A"is  put  in at  about  $400  million higher  in November  than under  "C."That's  the question.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  And how about December?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  is  that  because  there's  a biggerdifference  in--

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  But on  the  reserve  path, it's  only differentby  $40  million.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  the  reserve path difference  would be verysmall;  it's  not  different by much.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  why not?  I don't  understand  that.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Because  it  should be  $1 billion.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  The  reserve path  is  relevant  to  just  the  5weeks.  It's  not  quite  the  average  for  the month  of  December;  it's  the5 weeks  ending  December  22  or  whenever  it  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm  looking  at the  December  part of  thereserve path.  The  first  period  is  not  going to make any  difference,because we're going  to give you  the  level  of borrowings.  I'm nottalking  about what  the money  supply  actually does now.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  if  you  tell  us  the level  of  borrowing--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  We will  hold  that  level  of borrowing through--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, you'll  hold the  nonborrowed reservesthat  are  consistent with it  at  the  moment.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's  right.  And the  difference  in the  amountof  those  two--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It'll  make  no difference.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  But  if  you're  asking about  the differencein the  amount  of  the nonborrowed reserve  paths--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  what  I'm  asking--go ahead.  Thatwill  only be different in December.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I would  say Jerry is  right;  it's  roughly  $40million.  You'd  take  the  $400  million  difference and  divide  it  by  10or  something  like  that.11/17/81-49-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are  you telling me  the  difference in  thetheoretical  money supply--not  the  actual--for December between  6percent  and 8-1/2  percent  is  only  $400  million  in December?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  no.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  It  could be  $800  million.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  By December  the difference  is  $2 billion, muchof  which would affect  reserves  in  January.  So  I'd need  to make a veryexact  calculation here.  If  you just  take  the  December  $2 billiondifference,  that would be  a $200  million difference  in  reserves,roughly.  If  you take  the November difference,  that's a difference ofabout  $40  million in  reserves,  roughly.  And the  average  for  the5-week interval between  Committee meetings will  be  somewhere betweenthat  $40  million and $200  million on  a nonborrowed reserve path, givenborrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  So,  we're  talking  about  a difference ofonly  $200  million, which wouldn't  really materialize  all  in  Decemberin  choosing the  path.  Now the  much bigger difference  in  the actualborrowing is  going to  be  [because  of]  what actually happens  to  themoney supply.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's right;  that's how I started.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Is  your proposal  that  if  the  money  supply comesin  short we would lower  the borrowing?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that's what  I am trying  to  see--howmuch room we've  got  for  that.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We  stay  on  the nonborrowed path  if  growth  comesin  short,  so  borrowings  go  down.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  So  borrowings  fall  off?

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  That's  the problem.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Our  staff projection,  for what  it's worth,  isessentially  alternative C.  That  is,  we would expect money supplygrowth  to  come  in  at  around 5 percent  in November and  6 percent  in

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Unfortunately, with all  due  respect,  thatisn't worth much.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Right.  We  think  it will  be  that  or  a littleless.  So  if you  set  the path at  "A" and we were nearly  right  on  "C,"then borrowing by sometime  in December would probably be a couplehundred million  less  than  whatever borrowing number you choose,assuming nothing  is  done  to  raise nonborrowed  reserves.  That's  oneway of  looking at  it.  But  the  error  could be  a lot bigger  than  thatdifference,  one way or  the  other.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  $200 million  is--11/17/81-50-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  that's  the same  $200  million I havehere.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Right,  but  it  depends  on where you  start  it.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  has been  two months  or  6 weeks;  it's  come up.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes,  it's  a  lot  of borrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  but you're  saying  that's  if  it  camein  roughly around  5-1/2  percent.  If  it  came  in  at  3 percent  orsomething, that's  another  $200  million.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  then  borrowing would be  down to  close  to

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  That's  where  it  begins  to  bother me.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Then  you'd be  $400  million below path on totalzero.reserves.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't know how to  avoid  this.We'd just  run  into  the  federal  funds  rate constraint  then.  We have  toconsider what we  want  to  do with any  of  these alternatives.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  it  seems  to me  the more we  go  for  thereserve path under alternative A,  the  greater the  likelihood thatwe're going to  run  into  the  frictional  level  of borrowings very soon.If  you  can agree  with  the  staff's  forecast  that  the  actual moneygrowth  is  more  likely to  be  "C" than  "A,"  and then you  say to yourselfthat,  if  anything, we're more  likely  to  come  in  below that  than aboveit,  you've really  compounded the problem that  I've  been worrying  aboutby selecting  8 or 8-1/2  as  the money number  on which we  calculate thenonborrowed reserve path.  Although  it's  true  that  it's  only  $40million on  average  for  the  full  month of  November,  it's  going  toaccumulate  to a  lot more  than  that  on an  ongoing basis by  the  fifthweek of  this period.  I think  it  gets  to be  a rather  significantdifference.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I do,  too.  The pressure we will  geton  rates will  be  significantly  different  if we  have a  shortfall.  Andthat's what  the real  issue  is  about  today.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  I think  the  question  is:  Should we haveserious  downward pressure on  rates,  if  we  have shortfalls--not  only,as  Lyle  says,  from 8-1/2  percent  down to  5 percent, but  below 5percent  or whatever  it  is?  Shouldn't we be having  serious  downwardpressure  on rates  because of  the weakness  that  that  implies  for  theeconomy?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The question  is  how  far;  that's  theissue.  If  it  drops  another  225 basis points  in  the next  5 weeks  fromwhere  it  is  presently, that's  quite  a substantial  drop.  If  we  gobelow--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  If  you  look  at  cyclical  declines,  it's  not  avery fast  drop.11/17/81-51-

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  We're probably  going  to  need more

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  The faster we  get  it  down,  the  less  distanceit's  going  to  have  to  travel.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well, very  soon we'll  have  done as  much  as wedid in  1980.  We will  have cut  rates  about  in  half.  This would seemto  be doing  the  same  to  the  funds  rate and bill rate.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  But  I think  Paul  is  right  that we'd  hit  thefunds  rate  constraint  if  we go  through this  frictional  borrowinglevel,  and we'd have  a conference  call  as  to  what  to  do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I guess  I can't  convince myself  that  itmakes  all  that much  difference.  Unless  it  made  a real  difference,even if  the money supply was growing  someplace in  this  range,  wewouldn't want  to  see  the  federal  funds  rate drop  any more.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Mr.  Chairman,  I have  an  instinct--Mr.Sternlight may have  a different  one  or may share  it--that when we'retalking about  borrowings between $100  and  $350  million, neither  of  uscould argue  that  the  funds  rate would be--.  At the  low end  there's alittle  greater  odds  that it  will  drop  below the  discount rate.  At  thehigh  end there may be a little  greater  odds  that  occasionally  it willbe trading a point  above  the  discount rate.  But  basically it  would bearound the  discount  rate,  I think.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well, the  risk is  that  it  might drop  verysharply below the  discount rate,  and  in  that  case--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  But  only  if  required reserves turn  out  to  be alot  weaker than our  nonborrowed path.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But  still,  I don't  think these  differencesmake  much difference  in  themselves.  The question  is:  What happens  ifa real  shortfall  in  the  money supply is  added on  top  of  it?  In  thatcase we're going to  run  into  [the  need  for]  a consultation.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  In that  case the  lower the  growth rate  inmoney you start  from, the  less  chance you have of  being presented withthat problem early,  so  to  speak.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  It  seems most  desirable.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's  ignoring  our policy responsibility notto  have  a consultation  if we have  great  developing weakness in  theeconomy.  We don't want  to  avoid  the problem;  we want  to  precipitateit  so we can  talk  about  it.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Or we'll  have our consultationearlier if  we agree  on  an  11  percent  floor rather  than a  10  percentfloor.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That's  true.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think that's probably the practicaldifference here.  I take  it  that  everybody is  agreed  that,  whichever11/17/81-52-one of  these  numbers  we put  in,  if  the money supply  came  in  higher  inthe  short  run, we wouldn't want  to  run up  the  borrowings,  although  itwould be  called  for  if  we put  in  the  low number.  We'd have  tooverride  the  thing,  but  I  think  that's  understood.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  If  we put  the  "somewhat  higher" thing  inthere,  that makes  it  explicit.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Sure.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Which higher  thing?

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Regardless  of what  number  we pick,  if  we put"___  percent  or  somewhat  higher,"  it  makes  it  explicit  that we're notgoing  to  run up the  borrowing  if  the  money supply comes  in  stronger.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  What  happens  if  we  just  take  what we  had lasttime,  which  is  the 7 percent--leave it  alone--and set  the borrowingsat  $400  million  and our consultation rate  on  fed  funds  at  11  percent?

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Do you mean  7 percent  for  October  to December?

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  No.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  November  to  December.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  He means  September to  December, doesn't  he?

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  September  to December you  calculate  at  8percent.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  No, November  to  December.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  that's not  the  same  as we had  the  lasttime.  "A"  is  what we had last  time.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that's  the only thing.  Of  course,we can do  that  whatever we  say in  the  directive.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Well,  I would go  with Fred'sproposal.  To  me  it's  really  important  that we not  repeat  what  we didlast  year.  That's  the  one  time  I dissented  and I'd have  to dissentagain, I  think, if  the  fed funds  floor were put  so as  to permit such asharp drop  in  the funds  rate  over  a short  period of  time.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Don't  forget  that  last  year  the  economy wentdown  at  a real  rate of  9-1/2 percent  in  the second quarter.  No wonderthe  rates  dropped so  fast.  We're  going  to  have  a decline here  ofabout half  that.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The  reaction  to  that  would be  veryperverse  in  the  bond market.  I'm convinced of  it.  And  I think  thatis  much more  meaningful  to  an  economic  recovery.11/17/81-53-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  the  obvious  in-between course  is  todraw the path  just using  the  7 percent.  That  leaves  it  between the  8-1/2  and 6.  Something  around 7 or  7-1/2  percent  splits  the  difference;it  sounds  all  right  to  me.  If  the money supply  really goes  off  on  thedown  side, we're  going to  have a consultation anyway.  I think  that'squite evident.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  What  are you doing?  Are you suggesting  "B"with a quarter billion dollars  of  original  borrowing?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think  in  terms of  "Bs"  or whateverhere.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  communicate.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Set  the  borrowing requirement high  to  be  safe.Set  the path, however,  so  we get  some  addition  to  reserves  during  theperiod and some  downward pressure  on rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's what  we're  talking about.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  One might  term my proposal  "a son  of  a B,"  Iguess.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We're  talking about  $400  million, which  Iwouldn't want  to  exceed  in  the  short  run and,  say, 7 percent  just  forpurposes of  drawing the  path.  That's all  we  have to  do  at  the moment.Then we've  got  to  write  a directive which  encompasses  this.  And westill  have  the  choice  of whether to  put  in  a low  figure and  say  "orhigher,"  or to  put  in  a high  figure.  I tried  to  rewrite the  onestarting with the  high figure.  I had some  bias,  I must  confess,toward not  changing the  directive, which we can't  meet anyway everymonth.  But  let  me  try this  wording on you:  "After reviewing thequarterly targets for  M1-B  from September  to  December at an  annualrate of  7 percent  (after allowing  for NOW accounts)  and  for M2  at  anannual  rate of  about  10  percent  or slightly higher..."  And weprobably should put a phrase in  there  "adopted at  the  last meeting"  orsomething.  "...the  Committee  decided some  shortfall  in M1-B,generally consistent with phasing  into  the  tentative money growthtargets  set  for 1982,  would be  acceptable  in a context  of  declininginterest rates  and continued  strength of  M3."

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  M2.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  M2  rather,  yes.  I don't  know;  this  seemsfairly plain  to  me.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  I don't know how that  relates to  whatwe've been  talking about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it  relates  to  what  we  were  talkingabout  just now.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Is  that  the  end of  it,  Paul?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  couldn't be.11/17/81-54-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it  goes  on  and gives  the  federalfunds  range,  but  that's--

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  What's  that  going  to  say?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  7 percent  in November  and  December?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  the  same  language;  we've  got  to  fillin  the blanks.  I take  it  we have a  split between 11  to  15  percent  and10  to  15  percent, right?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I would much prefer  the  10  to  15.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  All  right.  My  feeling  in  substance  isthat  we  ought  to  consult  at  11  percent,  but  I--

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  I don't  think we  should  do  this  now.  With a  rangeof  6,  then  5, and  then  4 points,  we're  going  to  be  charged with comingevery  time closer  and closer  to  managing interest  rates.  Whether  ornot  they perceive  it  correctly,  that's  what  is  going  to  be  said.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  consider  that  entirely a bad  idea.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  If  that's what  you  want.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Fred, did you  hear  that?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Why do  we need to  specify?  One  sort  ofinference  [about]  interest rates  here  is  the  borrowing assumption.The  Chairman may  consult  the  Committee,  so  the  funds  rate constraintisn't  even  a binding  action.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  is  the  substance of  your comment?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I'm wondering why we need  to  expose  ourselvesto  the charge  that we're managing interest  rates  when we're not  doingthat?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Do you mean just  take  out  the  funds  ratereference?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Take out  the whole  sentence?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Take out  the whole  sentence.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  That's  certainly widening  it!

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Yes.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Nobody is  really going  to believethat we're  indifferent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know what people would concludefrom our  taking  out  the  sentence  entirely at  this  point.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  They'd never get  it  from Henry.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  That we've  gone  completely monetarist?11/17/81-55-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  for  sure,  at  this point.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  What  is  it,  75  percent of--

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Milton Friedman has  finally won!

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Let's  try  it  and  see what happens!

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I still  don't  like  the phrase about  phasinginto  next year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  think that  is  essential,  butI don't  know how other people  feel  about it.  It  gives  some  feeling ofthe dimension  of what  we're  talking about.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  To  restrain ourselves  this  late  in  the  yearwithout putting  that  comment  in  about  leading us  into  next year  wouldbe bad.  I'd be very much in  favor of  including  those  words.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  My problem is  that  [money  growth rates]  arecoming  in  so  low  this  year  that  if  we start  talking about  lowertargets next  year--there's  already  talk around the  market of  our beinglower-limit monetarists--it  gives  the  impression  that we're headingfor  the  lower  limit next year as  well.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Well,  as  I said  earlier,  it  seems to  me  that  thedirection we're  going will  tend to  put us  toward  that range.  We canphrase  it  in a way  that we are  aiming toward  that range,  notnecessarily  that we'll  fall  under  it.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Well, we're already under  for  this year.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Yes,  but  the  language doesn't--

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  The  language doesn't say that.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Well, we're going  to  be.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  [Unintelligible]  then we would have ashortfall.  [Unintelligible]  the  language--

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  It  sounds  as  if we're  trying  to pull  [money]down  so  we can make next  year's  target, and we're  already below wherewe want  to be next year--or where you guys  want  to  be next  year.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well, we have  the very real  question of  what  todo  about  this year's  shortfall--whether to  add it  to  next  year's rangeor not.  We haven't discussed  that.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  If  we move  to  plain M1,  then we're back to  theunadjusted and that's  right  in  the middle  of  the  range.  So,  we'dstart right  from there.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  We can do  a definition shift.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  We got  rid  of  the base  drift.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  We got rid  of  the base  drift.11/17/81-56-

SPEAKER(?).  Somebody  said  there  is  a  definition  shift.[Secretary's  note:  Mr.  Guffey was  leaving  the  room.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [To  Mr. Guffey]  Are you going to  vote?

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  No.  I don't  have  a vote  or  I would  stay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are  we having a vote?

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  Instead  of  base drift,  we're  going  to  usedefinition  shift.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  think we  can argue  out nextyear's  targets here.  We  have  a wide  enough range  [of  views]  to  startwith.  All  this  is  meant  to  convey  is  that we're  recognizing that  7percent  is  high and we  wouldn't mind being a  little  lower.  That'swhat we're  saying.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  I don't  understand why we want  to  deviateso  drastically from  the kind of  operational  directive  we  typically setup.  In  effect, we're  using  language  that  doesn't have  any meaning tome.  And  I don't  know how it  will have  any meaning  for somebody on  theoutside.  Why  [don't]  we  go  along the  lines  of what  Fred wassuggesting of  specifying for  the  directive that  we're seeking M1-Bgrowth  of  7 percent between October  and  December?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Or  somewhat  higher.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Or  somewhat higher.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That makes  it  seem quite  consistent.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Then we  know what we're  talking about

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  think you're going  to  getagreement  on that.  I'm allergic  to  [unintelligible]  down everymeeting, if  I may say so,  some  target  for  the next  5 weeks  that  hasnothing  to do  with  [unintelligible].  It's  just  the  law ofdistribution;  we don't  come  very close  to  it,  whether we're above orbelow it.  I'd  like  to  relate  the  actions  in  one  meeting  to  theactions  of  the previous meeting.  It's  just  presentational.  We didthat,  I guess,  last  time.  I forget what  we did last  time  insubstance, but  it  was  some  kind of  reiteration of  the  target  at  thebeginning of  the quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Well,  there may not be  agreement  around thetable, but  I  like what  Lyle  and Fred  are  suggesting  for  the directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know what  "7 percent or higher"means.  If  we  get  a  shortfall, what do  we  do  then?  Does  that implyreal  aggressiveness?  It  sounds  like  it  to  me.  You're  saying  now thatwe're  starting out  there;  I don't  think  the staff projection  is worthmuch, but  I think  the probabilities  are we  could well  be below 7percent.  Then we'd better be very aggressive.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I thought  it  was  going to  be  "7percent or  lower."11/17/81-57-

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Say 7 percent--

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Well,  if  we said  "7 percent  or  somewhat  lower,"what  does  that  do  for you?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Then do we  accept  it  if  gets higher?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  the problem:  Do we  accept  it  ifgets higher?

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  I can  see myself accepting if  it  gets higher,but  I wouldn't want  to  set  the  few  steering mechanisms we have  toaccomplish that.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  It's  highly unlikely  it would behigher.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  it  could  happen.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Who  knows  in  this  world?  But  I think wehave  to  have  agreement  that  if  it's  higher,  we don't want  to  doanything.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  That's  the  one  thing  I can agree  with.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And I thought we had  some  agreement  thatif  it's  lower,  we don't  want  to  be  all  that  aggressive either.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I certainly can go  along with  that.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I don't  know;  it  depends on how much  lower.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Isn't there  agreement  to  let  the  borrowingsslide if  it  begins  to  come  in  low?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.  I said  "not all  that  aggressive."We'd let  them slide  as  they would naturally  slide.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  But  the question  is  on what  path to  constructM1-B,  isn't  it--whether it's  7 or  8 percent  in  the  quarter?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Tentatively, I thought we'd arrived  atconstructing  the path on  7 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  if  we  start with a sufficiently highborrowing  assumption, I could go with  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No, we're  talking  about  $400  million,  as  Itake  it.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That's  surely high;  that's  the borrowingassociated with  "C" in  the  Bluebook.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The problem  is  that  if  we don't usethe 7 percent number, we  then  get  into  the  formulation--if we  don'twant to  change  it  in  the middle of  the quarter--in which the wordingis  so  fuzzy that  nobody really knows what  it  means.  If  we want  to11/17/81-58-follow a policy of  not changing  target numbers during  each quarter,that  would have  to  become,  I think,  a  consistent policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  if  we  had  a  strong reason  forwanting to  change  it,  we would change  it,  obviously.  But  I think whatpeople  are  saying here  is  that  if we met  that  original  target,everybody would be happy.

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  What  if  we  took your  language  there--I'm notsure  I have  it  right--and  got rid  of  the business  about  the generallyinitial  reference  to 7 percent growth  for  the  quarter.  We could putin a phrase that  said  the  Committee  sought growth  in  the monetaryaggregates  consistent with  the  7 percent,  taking  account  of  theshortfall  in October,  and  said nothing else.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know what  that  means.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I think  that  means we'd make  up  for  it.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Well,  it  means we  could go  ahead and  constructa path--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  [The  staff will]  construct  the path  on whateverthe  Committee  tells  us.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  I was  trying  to  get  around the problem somepeople  have with declining  interest  rates and  next year's  targets.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well, we  could do  it  by  saying  "forgetting theshortfall  in October."

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  We  could  say  "while noting  the  shortfall  in

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We can  say  "The Committee decided  in  thelight  of  the  shortfall  in October  to  accept  a lower  rate  for thequarter."  That we  can say.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  But  affirm the  target  for  the  last  two months.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  I think  that's what we're  doing.  We'reaccepting  the  shortfall  and  saying:  Let's  get  it  back on  7 percentfrom now on,  if  we  reasonably  can.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We have  several precedents  for saying weaccept  this kind  of  thing  in  a context  of declining  interest rates,  orthe  reverse,  don't  we?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  there  were  a couple  of  instances  of  thatthat  I have  found.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Yes,  one each way.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It  was back in  December  '80,  but  that  followeda period of  rapid  growth.11/17/81-59-

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Didn't we have  something  like  that  in  thedirective  in  April  or May of  last year,  Steve?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  in May  there was  a shortfall  from the2-month rate  specified, and  it  was  accepted in  the  light of  the  rapidgrowth in April.  They all  followed rapid growth;  that's  the problem.They didn't  follow slow growth.  In  August, Mr. Chairman,  followingthe  slow growth  in July, the  Committee  just  reaffirmed the  third-quarter  target  of  7 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  We were  expecting at  that  point  a prettyhefty growth  in August,  like  11  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  that's  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  And we weren't  faced with zero borrowings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I have  arrived at  wording  that  says:"The Committee decided  in  the  light  of  the  low rate of  growth intarget  for  the  quarter would be  acceptable, in  a context  of declininginterest  rates  and continued strength  in M2."  That  should  be worded,I think,  in  a conditional  way.  If  M2  is--

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  You're  going  to  drive  the monetarists  up  thewall with  that.  In  the  context  of  a weakening  economy and declininginterest  rates, we'll  accept  shortfalls  from  our  targets.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  in  substance what you want  to  do.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I know.  I'm not  a monetarist.  I was  justthinking about  those  sensitive  ears  out  there.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Why can't we just  say  "After taking note  of  themovements  of  the  aggregates,"  with no  specification as  to  what  theywere,  "the Committee decided..."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  You have  to  decide.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Oh,  I think  that's what  we're going to

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  But you're  saying  here  "after noting theshortfall"  or  "after accepting a shortfall."  I don't  think we need  tosay that.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I think  the lesser  evil  is  to  put  the7 percent  number down  and not worry  about  the  fact  that  we'rechanging.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  The only  alternative  is  to put  a short-term rangein  and  I don't want  to  suggest  that.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  It's  easier  to  say 7 percent for  the  last  twomonths.11/17/81-60-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I may  say  so,  in response  toPresident  Solomon's  comment:  I'm  not  an  expert  on  public  relationsbut  the Committee  had  put  down  a  third-quarter number  of  7 percent;  itwas missed and I  think it  was  understood.  For  the  fourth quarter  anumber  of  7 percent  also was put  down,  which will probably be missedand probably will  be  understood.  But  if  the  Committee then decides  toput  down a November-December number  that  is  also  7 percent,  people  aregoing to  wonder  after you've missed  that  one.  This would be yourthird  try.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  partly what bothers  me.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  We're becoming  predictable.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  keep  promising these  short-term resultsthat  we don't  get.  That  is  precisely what bothers me.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  The market  can adjust  it  to  that  point,  so  long  aswe stay  consistent.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  It  seems  to  me  there's  a real  risk  in putting  outa  [number  in  the]  directive  that we  know we  can't  achieve.  Apparentlywe're  far enough  through  the period that  the  opportunity of  having  the7 percent  come  in  is  very  remote.  If  that's  the  case,  are we  betteroff  using a number which  is  more achievable  and gives  us  morecredibility?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We're  not  that  far  off  in  the sense  thatwe'll probably hit  the M2  target.  And what we're  saying  in thisformulation is  that  we agree we will  probably miss  on M1.  That  is  thepurpose of  this  [wording].

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  What  is  your projection  for now,Steve,  5 percent?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Alternative C  is  essentially our projection,  orwe think  it  will  come  in a  little  lower.  That's why we bent  thewording  that  way.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Well, what  we're  trying  to  do  isstructure  a compromise,  Si.  We're most  likely to  hit alternative C  orbelow, but  that's  not acceptable  to  a substantial  number  of  people,Chuck and others.  So we've been trying  to  grope  for  a compromise  inthat  area.  If  we  go back to  your  kind of  language,  even  though  it'sconfusing  to  the public,  we'd still have  to  have  a privateunderstanding  on how much shortfall--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  there  isn't  any what  you callprivate understanding.  Yes,  we have  to  set  a  reserve path, whichwe've  just  tentatively set;  there's no  obscurity about  it.  The  way toavoid these  things  in  the  future--but  it would get us  into  otherproblems--is  to  say we're  setting  the reserve path at  X,  which weconsider  consistent with  7 percent.  We  are not promising we're goingto make  7 percent;  that's  just  where we're  setting  the reserve path.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  What  is  the great  difficulty with using  7percent--and  that  sets  the  reserve path--and  then using  the borrowing11/17/81-61-assumption and  the  fed  funds  constraint  to  take  care  of  the  fact  thatwe  are going  to miss  that  one way or  the  other?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's what  we're  trying to  do,  as  Iunderstand  it.  I think we have  agreement  on  the  substance;  it's  justhow to  describe  it.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  My problem is  my  simple mind;  I don't  have  anydifficulty with what  I just  said.  But  maybe others  do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Do  you  think you can  give language  for  adirective,  if  I understood you correctly?

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I just  would use  the number  7 percent  in  astraightforward directive--the  normal  kind  that  we  have used before.I'd use the  numbers  for M1-B  and M2  that  are  under alternative B,which are  7 percent and  11  percent or  something  like  that.  And thenI'd put in  a fed  funds  constraint, which  I would prefer at  11  percentbecause  it's  very difficult  to  know what  is  going to  transpire  in thisvery  short period of  time  and I think  it's  worthwhile  to confer  at  11percent.  I'd  start with  a borrowing assumption  of  $400  million,recognizing that  there is  every likelihood that  it  will  come down andnone  that  it would  go  up  because we would be  generally tolerant ofsome additional  strength  in  the  aggregates, which none  of  us  feels  isgoing  to  happen.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  What  about  the  language you had a minute  agothat we would provide  reserves  in the  two-month period that would beconsistent with a 7 percent  rate  of  growth  in  the  money supply?  Shiftit  from a pinpoint  to  a reserve  supply in  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's just  the  traditional  form.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  And  say we're going  to  hit  the  money supply at7 percent, but--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  is  the wording we  have--that weprovide  reserves  consistent with  the  7 percent.  This  says  "behaviorof  reserve aggregates."  We  can do  it  just by putting in  thosenumbers.  That's  right.  And every month we're putting in  numbers  thatwe aren't  going to  make.  We  can  do  that;  that's  simple enough.  But  Idon't  think it  conveys  any more  information.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  A number  has  two  purposes.  One is  a target;then there  is  a number which  is  used to  construct  a nonborrowedreserves path.  So,  it  has  two  functions.  And it  seems  to  me  thateven  if we  really don't  think conditions  are  such  that we will make  itas  a target,  it  is  useful  in  setting the path.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  There's  no question.  The more I look atthis,  the more  I think we're arguing over  nothing.  We  act  as  if  theonly  thing people read  is  this  paragraph.  Whatever we  say we're goingto  have  to  describe  in  the  rest  of  the policy record, and we'represumably going to  describe  it  in more  or  less  similar terms.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  How about  something  like  "While taking note  ofthe moderate shortfall  in growth  of  the aggregates  during October"--and  it  was  only  a moderate  shortfall--"the Committee  continues  to  seek11/17/81-62-expansion at  the  rate  of  about  7 percent  in M1-B and  10-1/2  percent  inM2  in  the period  ahead."  And  that  says  we gave  up  October.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  While noting  it  and  ignoring it.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  taking  note, we  continue  to  seek--

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Don't you have M2  growth  too  low?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I didn't  have  the  Bluebook  open right  there.  Ithink  10-1/2  percent  is  about--

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  11-1/4  percent  is--

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  I didn't  say  it  very well,  Governor  Partee,but  that's  the  gist  of  what  I was  trying  to  say before.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  We'd have  to  drop  out  the  language  "seeksbehavior  of  reserve aggregates."  Or maybe we wouldn't.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  the  traditional  way of  doing  it.  Idon't  think  it  makes  any difference  in  substance;  we'll  describe  itall  anyway  [in  the policy  record].  But  it  gives  you less  informationand we're  still  back to  this  business  about  jumping up and down  everytime we have  a 2-month  target  or  a  5-  or  6-week target  over  which wedon't have much control.  But  if  you  can rationalize  it  and say  that'swhere  the reserve path--

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  How about  "set  the  reserve path designed  toachieve X percent  growth"?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that's  what we  say ordinarily.That's  the  traditional  form.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I really don't  think  this  is  a good month  to  tryto  reform the  way we  state  the  directive.  It's  in  the middle  of  aquarter,  as  you  said before;  it's  at  the  end  of  a year;  and it's  in  aperiod where we're going  to  fall  short  of  our  growth  for  the year as  awhole.  And we just  shouldn't  be doing  fancy things  with the  directiveright now.  If  we want  to do  it,  we can  do  it  in  January  and  start  outa new year with  a--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But we don't  have  this  kind of  problem infor  which we  have no  targets.  So,  we don't  have  the  problem.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  Does  anybody recall  how we handled this  a yearago  when we went  through some  gyrations  in  order  to  get  the  monetarygrowth rates  cranked down so  that--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think we  presented a quarterlytarget  a year ago.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I don't  think so  either.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  difference  now is  that we  have putthese  things  on  a quarterly basis, and we did  that  with a purpose  inmind--maybe  it  was  only in my mind--which was  to be  a  little11/17/81-63-consistent over  the  quarter.  The  concept  was  for  the  meeting in  themiddle  of  the  quarter  to  review the  target we  already  set  for  thequarter.  Now,  this  is  a kind of  reversion to  taking a look at  it--

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I like Chuck's  language.  Governor Partee'slanguage  finesses  all  of  our problems  and we've had enough discussionhere,  I think, that  the  Manager will  know what  it  is  we're trying  toachieve.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We could be more specific  as  to  the  time periodby saying  "for the  remainder  of  the  year"  instead of  "in  the periodahead."

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That  is  five weeks?

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  No, it's  almost seven.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It's  essentially November and  December.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  think  we're  arguing aboutany  substance.  As  a matter of  form,  I don't  like  it.  But  ifeverybody  else likes  it--

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  What's  the  funds  rate  formulation, Chuck?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Oh,  I didn't  specify  that.  We were  just  talkingabout  directive  language.  The  specs  the Chairman will  recommend  tous,  I'm sure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  on  that,  I would prefer the  11  to  15percent  just  to  get  a consultation at  around 11  percent.  If  we wereabsolutely  symmetrical around where  we now are, we'd make  it  10-1/2  to15-1/2  percent,  I guess.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  It  gives us  a little breathing room.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Why don't we make  it  10  to  16,  Schultz?  Betteryet.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  It's  the bottom  end--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  16  percent,  ha, ha, ha.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  It's  only been a month since  it  was  there.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  A lot  has  happened  in  a month.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  see how anybody can take  anyoffense at  10-1/2  to  15-1/2  percent.  That  is  absolutely  thetraditional--I'm talking  about  the  outside reader.  A Committee membercan, maybe.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That  centers  it  on  13  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  centered on  where we  are,  which  iswhat we've been doing.11/17/81-64-

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  then  it  is,  what--2-1/2  points  below  thediscount  rate?  That must  mean that  there's  practically onlyfrictional borrowing.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It's  not  lower  than where  the discount  rate  is.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Then  it's  very unstable already.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Yes,  Henry, but  we'll  send you  a recommendationon the  discount  rate.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  I've  already  sent  one.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  That's  something  one would like  to  be able  to

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes, but  that goes  to  the reserve path,  Ithink,  not  to--.  Well,  one  can argue  that  we might want  to consult  ata higher  rate.  I'd just  as  soon consult  at  a higher  rate myself.  ButI don't  think where we put  this  number  is  going  to  affect  where  thefunds  rate  goes;  it  affects  where we consult.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  that's  what  I had  in mind.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  Well,  we never  consult  unless  that bottom  levelis  broken.  We never  consult  just  because  it  drops  and touches  thenumber  and pops back up.  I tell you:  The  funds  rate  is a  little  over13  percent now, and  if  we're  breaking 11  percent  in a  5-week period,that's  really moving  down.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  We've  had informal  agreements  before  to consultbefore we hit  the  bottom or  the  top  of  the  range.  We  could do  thatthis  time  also.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  We  certainly  shouldn't wait  a week  andestablish the  average  that begins  breaking  the  lower  level.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I am sensitive  to  your point, but we  stillhave  to put some  number  in here.  In  fact,  we may consult  before  weget  to  that  number.  That's  always  an option.  We  can consult  any  timewe want  to  consult.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  And you can  control  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I have a  certain  amount  of  control  overthat.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  do  you  feel  constrained  from  consultingbefore  we reach  that point?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No.  Not  for  that  reason  alone.  I onlyfeel  constrained  in the  sense  of  wanting  to consult  if  there weregenuine  confusion  over what  we  should do, whatever  these  numbers  are.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  If  we had  an M1-B  target  of  7 percent  forrange  of  10-1/2  to  15-1/2 percent,  and  initial  borrowings  at  $400million, does  that  cover what we've been  [unintelligible]?11/17/81-65-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I am not  in  favor of  thatformulation.  But  if  everybody  else  loves  that  formulation--

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  What was  that  first  alternate  directivelanguage  you had earlier  in  the meeting  about  five hours  ago?  The onethat  we  didn't have  [in  front  of  us].

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  It  said the  Committee  had  set aside--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  was  essentially this,  just  astraightforward--

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  No.  There  was some nuance  in  there  thatallowed you to  keep the  7 percent  quarterly number.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I think  it  was  "a somewhat higher growth ratewould be acceptable  and would be  consistent with  the  quarterly targetspreviously  [adopted]."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  puts  in  the  "higher."  It  says  thelower one  won't be  acceptable at  7 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  It  had a second sentence that  it  could behigher  if  it  was  consistent with  the quarterly targets  or  somethinglike  that--

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  But  isn't the  presumption  clear enough therethat  if  it's  lower, we would respond the  same way?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think so,  but  that's  why I'm notcrazy about  it.  This one  only had 10-1/2  percent  for M2  as  Mr.Axilrod wrote  it.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  But  is  10-1/2  percent  on M2  consistent  with 7percent  on M1,  Steve?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  for  the quarter, we  thought  it would be alittle higher  than 10-1/2  percent;  it  could be  11  percent.  But  theCommittee's decision was  10  percent  or a little higher  last  time.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  For  the  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  For  the quarter.  So,  it's  not  inconsistentwith  that  at  all.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  We might  go with  a straight crap  shoot and callit  7 and  11.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That's  what  I have:  7 percent  for M1-B and 11percent  for M2  for  the  remainder of  the year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let's  settle  this  federal  fundsrange.  All  these cosmetics  don't  amount  to  a hill  of  beans  in  someway, since we explain  it  all  in  the  [policy record].  Who  wants  to  putthe bottom at  11  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  The  fed funds  rate?11/17/81-66-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  bottom of  the  fed  funds  range.  Well,we  have  a majority  there,  clearly.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  How am  I going  to  [contend]  with  having aconsultation  at  11  percent?  Usually  I'm against  that  kind of  thing.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Why  don't  you ask who will  accept  10-1/2?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  the  alternative  is  10-1/2  percent.Big  deal!  How many would prefer  10-1/2?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I would prefer  it.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Why not  10-1/2  percent with  a consultation at11  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I  like Chuck's:  Consult  at  11  percent;  7percent  [for  M-1B];  and  10  percent  [for M2].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  only problem I see  with 11  percent,which  I prefer  in  fact  on  the  lower  end,  is where  to put  the  top.  A16  percent  figure  looks  a  little  ridiculous  to  me.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  You've  got  it!

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  We can consult  at  11;  it's  the  same thing.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  To maintain  our  credibility in  fighting againstinflation at  16  percent.\ 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How about  11  to  15  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  How about  11  to  16  and consult  at  15?

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  But,  Henry,  that's  symmetrical.  You  don't wantto  be  that--

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Sometimes  we  can afford  to  be  symmetrical.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  An  11  to  15  percent range  happens  to  becompletely symmetrical  around the present  level  of  13.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Do you want  a show of  hands?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.  Is  that  acceptable?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Acceptable  is  what you want?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Acceptable  at  this  point.  All  right.Now,  I take it  there's  agreement  that  we're going  to  set  a path on  the7 percent  and we probably won't be  moving that  discretionarilydownwards very  readily because we haven't much  room to  do  so.  If  itcomes  in  weak, it  will go  down by  itself  starting  at  a borrowing levelof around  $400  million.  I think that's  where we've been.  So,  theonly thing  that  remains  is  that we  can  just  use  this  traditionalformat and  say  7 percent  for M1  and whatever we  say  for M2.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  11  percent.11/17/81-67-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  11  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Well, when we  say 7 percent,  is  it  going to  bethe wording  that's  here  of  September to  December?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  October to  December.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Or November  and December.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We can put  the phrase  that  Chuck had  infront  of  it:  "The Committee noted  the  shortfall."

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  The moderate  shortfall.  It's  the  only monthwhen we had just  a moderate  shortfall.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Yes,  but  I think we  talked  about November  and

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Say  "for the  remainder of  the year" so  that  wedon't have  to  say November to  December.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Did we overshoot  on M3?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We don't  specify M3.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Don't  forget bank credit.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  A higher aggregate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "The Committee,  after noting a moderateshortfall  in  M1"?  Yes,  but  turn it  around.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I'd say  "a symmetrically moderateshortfall  in  M1  and an  overrun  in M2."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  we  didn't have an  overrun  in M2.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  No,  we didn't.  We  expected  12.9  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  the  directive  said 10  percent  forthe  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  In  the  earlier part,  in  the  general paragraphsof  the directive, there needs  to  be  some reference  to  the  eliminationof  the  surcharge.  You have  a sentence here  which is  "On October 30the  Board  of  Governors  announced a reduction  in  the Federal Reservebasic  discount  rate from 14  to  13  percent."  I would  think we'd alsowant  to  add that  "on November  16  the  Board announced the  eliminationof  the  surcharge."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm glad somebody reads  that!

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Mr. Chairman, without  raising any furtherproblems for  the  Committee, with  Governor Partee's addition of  "afternoting the  shortfall"  does  the  Committee  want  to  say after  the 7percent  "or somewhat more"?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No.  I don't  think  so.11/17/81-68-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I just  said  "about."

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  When we  say  "somewhat more,"  does  that mean wefreeze  the  funds  rate  at  that  level?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think we want  to  say  "somewhatmore"  especially because of  what happens  if  it's  somewhat  less.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Why can't we  say  "about"?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  I said  "about"  7 and 11  percent.  "Around"is  all  right.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  This  directive  will  get known as  the7 to  11.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  the  directive will  say  is:  TheCommittee, after  noting a moderate  shortfall  in growth  in M1-B  in

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  And the  continued  high  level  of M2.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "...  seeks  behavior  of  reserve  aggregatesconsistent with growth of M1-B  from October  to  December  at  an  annualrate  of  7 percent  (after allowance  for...Now accounts)  and with growthin M2  at  an  annual  rate  of  around 11  percent."  And we're  at  11  to  15percent  on  the  federal  funds  range.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I think we're making  it  needlessly difficult bypointing  to M2  as  the balancing  item  that  keeps  us  where we  are.  Whydon't we just  play down M2  in  this?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  is  just  the way  it  was  the  last  time.They  get  equal  weight.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Yes,  but now we've mentioned the  shortfall  inone and said nothing about  the  other  except--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  other was  within  the target.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We  were  expecting apparently a higher Octobernumber  than we  got  by  a couple  of  points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We were  expecting a higher number thanwhat we got  and we were 0.7  below the  figure we mentioned in thedirective.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  was  surprising,  considering all  saverscertificates.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Let's vote.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm in  favor  of  that.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Mr. Altmann called  to  my attention that we havehad more  than  one change  in  the  surcharge  since the  last  meeting.We'd have  to  do more  than put  in  this  suggested elimination, so  Iwithdraw my suggestion.11/17/81-69-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  So,  there's  no mention  of  a surcharge?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Why don't  we put  both  of  them  in  there?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I  think we can  delegate  to  the  Secretaryto  put  in a mention of  the  surcharge  in  the  appropriate  place.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  How about  "eliminated it  in  two  stages."

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Are you  dropping  from the  directive  the  commentsabout  next year?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Except  to  the extent  that  they're  in  thatparagraph that  indicates  the preliminary specifications.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Yes,  it  does--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Now that  we have  labored over  this  thingthat  nobody is  going  to  see  for  six weeks and until  it's  no  longerrelevant  any more--

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  And will  be  known as  the  Federal  Reserve  crapshoot when it  comes out.
