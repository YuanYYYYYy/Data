CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Good morning,  everyone.  Is Mike Prell  coming?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Mike  is arriving for a just-in-time briefing, Mr. Chairman.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Would someone  like to approve  the minutes of the

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Mr. Fisher, you are on.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Before  I ask a question,  I have a hypothesis.  It isconceivable  that the  1982  report on System  holdings of individual  securities  slipped betweenthe drawer and the bottom of somebody's  desk and that created  a precedent.  [Laughter]Therefore, the  data were not published in  1982 and it was  presumed that they should not bethereafter.  I say that only half tongue in cheek.Questions  for Peter?  Starting with his  second request,  is there  any objection  toincluding the  detailed portfolio information  in the annual  report?  If not, we  will assume  thatit is acceptable,  and we need  a vote on  domestic operations.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move approval,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  We also need  a vote on theintermeeting  leeway.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval  of the additional leeway  to$12  billion.3/25/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It has  been moved.  Is there  a second?

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There  is a second.  Without objection.  Thank youall.  Let's  move on with record  speed to Mr. Prell.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Mike?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  I was a little uncertain  as to  the wealth effects  on consumerspending  in the Greenbook  forecast.  I had the impression that there certainly  was an impactfrom higher equity prices  in particular, but in the Monday  staff briefing to the Board, youseemed to be saying that there was  not much of an effect.  Would you  go into that a little,please?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  On our interpretation,  there probably  has been some  positive effecton consumption over the past year or so from the  increase in financial wealth.  Setting  asidemeasurement  problems, that effect likely has in reality been offset at least  to some degree byan increased propensity to save based on concerns  about retirement  income and for otherprecautionary  reasons.  Going forward,  we would interpret our forecast  as continuing toincorporate  some positive wealth effect, but again  with these other factors  tending to balancethat.  Because  we have  assumed  that the stock market  tops out as we move into the latter partof this year and then declines noticeably in  1998, the  wealth-to-income  ratio  falls back aconsiderable  distance toward where it was several years ago.  That tends to diminish thewealth  effect as we move  out in  1998.  Another factor to keep in mind is that we have had asurge in income growth over the past year or so.  It would be natural,  given a permanentincome  view,  for spending to lag a bit and for the  saving rate, all other things equal, to edge3/25/97up a bit.  As income  decelerates  over the next year or so, we might  still be getting  someadjustment in consumption  that would then tend to result in the saving  rate  edging lower.  So,we  see a number of counteracting forces  that we have  tried, at least judgmentally, to balancein a sensible way in the forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I noticed that you built into your forecast  for  1998  an increase  of75 to 100 basis points in the federal  funds rate.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  75 basis points.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I  gather from the  wording of the Greenbook  and your briefingthat that was basically to keep real  interest rates  stable.  But I wondered why  you were  doingthat.  At least in my memory, it was a change  from earlier  Greenbook  practices,  and  I wouldfind it helpful  to have your comments  on this.  Of course, we can see in your alternativeprojections  what  the effects are if you  do not change the federal  funds rate assumption.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  felt quite uneasy about  what kind of message the forecast wouldconvey had we retained the  assumption of a flat nominal  funds  rate.  We perceived that  theunderlying  strength  of demand has been  greater than we expected.  Extrapolating  that tosome degree, it exacerbates  what we  already saw  as a fundamental  instability.  I think thiswas highlighted in some  of the longer-run  simulations in the last Bluebook,  where westretched the projections  out a bit.  Perhaps it became  clearer to you there that what weforesaw with  unchanged  nominal interest rates  was in  essence  a path where resourceutilization was going to continue to be well above sustainable  levels.  Following up on thatanalysis,  we thought that the assumed uptilt in the funds rate would be a natural way to3/25/97indicate  that at some point nominal interest  rates probably  would have  to rise to avoidexcessive  stimulus.  We built in something that is on a par with what is happening  to the coreCPI and to some of the broader  GDP-related price measures.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I certainly do not object to that  approach as a forecast.  It clearlyis in line with a lot of major forecasts.  But I thought the whole  point of doing theGreenbook,  at least the way  we have been doing it, was  to have  something that shows whathappens  if we do not change anything.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  For all practical  purposes the assumed rise in the funds  rate istantamount  in terms of the  economic outcome  to your not doing anything over the period1997  and  1998.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  True.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  But I thought it might be  a useful  signal  here of what we nowperceive  to be the longer-term unsustainability  of the scenario  that we have been  drawing inprior Greenbooks.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I think it was useful to get those alternatives, but which of thealternatives do you think would be most closely aligned with an opportunistic  approach?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I guess it is a matter of interpretation  as to what the opportunisticapproach  entails.  If it entails  making sure that the inflation  rate does not move above  therecent  range, then  our forecast implies  that a policy move is necessary  at some point.Whether that means a relatively  aggressive approach  or something that involves a continued"wait and see"  stance and moving later, I don't think we can readily discern.  But the fact is3/25/97that our forecast  does imply that, in an underlying  sense,  consumer price inflation is movingabove the 3 percent mark in  1998.  If you view that as a ceiling in the range  of acceptableoutcomes and the point where you want to apply the brakes, then I suppose you could  arguethat a more aggressive  approach than  that associated with our baseline forecast  is the one thatis consistent with opportunism.  But that is in  the eye  of the beholder.  I do not think we candefine its application that precisely.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mike,  if you look back at your forecasts  of last summer, youwere projecting much lower growth  than occurred at the end of 1996 and that you nowanticipate through  1997.  When you made  your comments  this morning, I think you  used thephrase "entering  a boom at this point."  I was just wondering if you  could step back andexplain what has happened  here.  Why are  you now expecting  a boom or "maybe"  a boom?What  has changed in this period?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The "maybe"  is  an important qualifier.  That is not our baselineforecast,  but again these  are matters of definition.  We do have  a forecast  that, given currentmoney market conditions,  now sees the most likely outcome  as above-trend  growth for anextended period and  an unemployment rate that falls to 5 percent or less.  In some sense, youcould regard that as boom conditions even without going to the more dramatic,  strongergrowth scenario  that I suggested  was a risk.  Why has this occurred?  I think we consistentlysaid that we did not see the stimulus that would maintain  above-trend  growth, so we keptforecasting that growth was  going to fall back to something like trend  for lack of acompelling  reason that it should not.What has happened?  That is very hard to sort out.  If we look at consumerbehavior,  for example,  we have not had a drop in the saving rate.  It  is true that the stock3/25/97financial wealth that either has reflected  or supported  a tremendous  surge in consumersentiment.  We  are at very high levels  of consumer confidence  according  to the Michigan  orthe Conference  Board surveys.  The current Michigan index is the  highest since  1965,  and inonly a few  months in the  history of that index have  there been numbers  this high.  I thinkthere is  at this point some buoyancy in consumer demand beyond  what we would haveanticipated.  We see very lean inventories.  We continue to be  surprised on the upside by thestrength in computer investment;  we have had some very strong numbers.  We seem to begetting a more  solid performance  in nonresidential  construction than we anticipated.  Youwill recall that we were somewhat puzzled by weak contracts data through much  of last year,but they tended to catch up with an enormous  burst in the fourth quarter.  All  the anecdotalevidence  suggests there  is more momentum in that sector than was  apparent  six months  ago,and that has multiplier effects.  The upside  surprise seems to be a collection  of things thathave  supplied a considerable  lift to economic  activity.  At this point, while we  are stillsomewhat in the  spirit of saying that economic  growth probably will move back towardtrend, we see an economy  that seems to have considerable  momentum,  and we are notoptimistic that the moderation  in growth  is going to occur overnight.  Basically, one of thethings we learned was that financial conditions  were  not imposing as much restraint on theeconomy as we thought they would.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further questions for Mike?  If not, who wouldlike to start the roundtable?  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  the Fifth District economy continues  a healthyadvance.  Labor markets  remain exceedingly  tight throughout most of the District, especially3/25/97in some of the booming areas  of the southern part  of the District in the Carolinas  alongInterstate  85.  Wages  for skilled labor in that part of our District have been moving upgradually  for some time.  We now hear more reports  of pay increases  for unskilled workers.In Charlotte, for example,  hourly pay for entry-level  unskilled workers  has risen about adollar over the last year to a range of 7 to 8  dollars  on average  currently.  Elsewhere,  bothresidential and  commercial  real estate and construction  activity are rising sharply.  On  thecommercial  side in particular,  we see  very low vacancy rates  and rising rents in some areas.That  is especially the case in  suburban areas, but to some extent  we see it in central city areasas well.  Most of the other anecdotal  information we have received recently  is consistent  withwhat appears  to be happening in other parts  of the country.  Consumer  spending clearlyseems  to have accelerated  in recent weeks.  With respect to prices,  although labor and othercosts  are rising, there is relatively  little talk of imminent price increases  in most of thecomments that we hear.  Indeed,  at their last meeting,  several  of our directors went out oftheir way to say that there was a general absence  of pricing power  in most markets  withwhich  they were  familiar.There  are nonetheless  a few  straws in the wind.  One director mentioned thatrecent  increases in  trucking fees were beginning to stick for the first time in a while.who runs a large farm equipment dealership  told methat his major supplier, John Deere, is no longer  guaranteeing prices  for items  that will bedelivered later in the year.  But those types of comments  are still the exception  rather than  therule.Turning to the national  picture, it is hard, for me at least, not to be impressed bythe current across-the-board momentum  in the economy.  As you already  mentioned this3/25/97morning, Mike, and as the Greenbook points out, the Michigan  Consumer  Confidence  Indexis now  at its highest level since  1965.  That started me thinking a little about  1965; it was agood year for the economy.  At the time, Arthur  Okun described the  situation as "thepromised land of 4 percent  unemployment with no compelling evidence  of acceleratingwages and prices or stress in financial  markets."  In hindsight, of course, we know  that 1965was the  year in which  inflation really began to take off.  The inflation rate  was below  2percent in  1965; it rose to over 3  percent in  1966 and  subsequently to over 6 percent by theend of the decade.Obviously, there  are  significant differences  between  1965  and  1997,  not the leastof which is our greater  commitment,  I believe,  to contain  inflation and resist inflationarypressures  and the greater credibility that goes  along with it.  But I think there  also are somestriking parallels between  the situation in  1965,  at least early in that year,  and what we arefacing now.  As in  1965,  the economy is now operating  at a very high level and it strikes meas being quite vulnerable  to upside  shocks.  In the  1960s,  of course, the shock ultimately tookthe form of the Vietnam  military buildup.  The most likely shock, if that is the right word, in1997 would be a more subtle process.  It would involve  a kind of circular process  whereincreased spending  generates  increases in jobs, which  generate  increases  in income,  whichencourage  further spending,  and so forth. I think a key feature  of policy in  1965  was that themagnitude  of the upside risk was  not appreciated  by the policymaking  establishment as awhole as we went into that year.  In the current situation, I worry that the public, asrepresented by the industrialist who sat next to Mike Prell, does not adequately  appreciate  theextent  of the current upside risk, mainly because  of the damping  effect of three temporaryfactors on wage  and price behavior.  These  are:  the job insecurity that the Chairman has3/25/97emphasized  in his recent public  comments,  increased labor  force participation,  which alwaysoccurs  at this point  of the cyclical  expansion but which  I think is greater now than isnormally the case,  and the strong dollar.Let me make just a quick comment on each of those.  As you  said, Mr. Chairman,once the downward  adjustment  of real  wages to the increase  in job insecurity  is complete,  wewould expect the usual impact of tight labor markets on wages  to reassert  itself.Furthermore,  if labor markets remain as tight as they  are now for  any extended period  in thefuture,  at some point workers are  not going to feel insecure  any longer.  When  that happens,we could see the usual short-run Phillips-curve  effect  reassert itself just as the restrainingimpact of job insecurity  begins  to unwind.  We will then have two forces  working on  the costside and a considerable  upside  risk from that direction.  Similarly,  tight labor marketsencourage  greater  labor force participation  because job search costs  are lower and  wages  arehigher.  Sooner or later, that effect will dissipate  even if demand remains  strong.  Here  again,greater  labor force participation  can only delay the  emergence of inflationary  pressures, notprevent them.  Finally, the restraint from foreign  competition  on U.S. inflation  can workonly so long as the dollar remains strong  and does not depreciate significantly.  This, ofcourse, turns on the ability  of the United  States to  continue to attract  capital  inflows.  I thinkwe have been lucky on this front over the course of the last  several  quarters  in that  oureconomy has been quite  strong compared  to the economies  of other major industrial  nations.Obviously, that situation  could change.  If growth in Japan  and Europe  were to begin  toaccelerate, we could have  some weakening of the dollar.The bottom line as  I see it, Mr. Chairman,  is that  I do not think the foundation  forour favorable  macroeconomic  performance  is very solid or secure  at this stage.  We need  to3/25/97do all we can with monetary policy to reinforce  that performance.  I think we have beenpushing our luck with monetary policy in recent months.  We  could do this because  we hadbuilt a lot of credibility in  1994, but I would not want to see us push our luck much further.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There  is  a wide range of opinions in the way  oursociety is looking at this inflation phenomenon.  I don't remember it ever being so broad.  Iam not talking  about the  uninformed; I am talking  about people who  are participating  in thesystem.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  Regarding the Cleveland  District first, both bankersand  a retail  executive for a national  firm expressed their concernsabout the construction  of additional  retail space.  There  isalready excess space as far as they are  concerned.  Store closings  are starting to occur, yetnew construction  is being planned  and put into place.  One of the bankers  said that lendingstandards relating to the construction  of commercial  real estate  have disappeared  in the lastcouple of months.  He hears of lending agreements  with no takeouts being  arranged, nopermanent financing  being locked  up, no tenants being signed,  and he is finding itincreasingly  difficult  to rein in his own people  and have them turn down  applications  forsuch construction  loans.  Also, he  thinks extensions of C&I loans, which  have been  verystrong throughout the region,  may be increasing  further.  Interest margins have continued toerode.  On the noninterest  expense  side, it is a mixed story.  Several directors,  bankers andnon-bankers,  talked about how their telephone expense  has dropped dramatically.  A bankersaid his overall telephone  expense-- --is down 25 percent from a yearago, but his software  costs are skyrocketing.  On balance, he has not seen  much benefit.3/25/97from the retail sector  said that  even though January  and Februarysales came in a lot better than expected both nationally  and in  the region, he still thinks thatgrowth in retail spending  over the next few  years is  going to average  only about 3  percentversus  5 percent so far in the  1990s.  So, he is pessimistic  regarding the sustainability  of thekind of retail  spending we have  seen.  In the steel industry, from  a very largecompany said that he  had his people do  some research on productivity in  1996 versus  1993.Over the three-year period,  they had an increase  of 27 percent in productivity, and withoutthat his company would not have been  able to sustain  its earnings because  they have not beenable to adjust  their prices so far.  He  said that steel imports  were flooding  in.  In the fourthquarter  such imports were  25 percent  above  a year earlier.  He  sees downward pressure  onsteel prices, but then, oddly, he  said that he took advantage  of a current  situation in thethought the  increase  would stick, and he replied that,he personally did not think it would.  Some  on his  topmanagement team thought that current  market conditions  presented an opportunity  and thathe had an obligation  to try to find out if the market  would support the  price increase.  I foundinteresting this shift in attitudes  and willingness to test the receptivity  of the market to higherprices.Another interesting development  in my view relates to the newsprint  side of thenewspaper  industry.  You will recall that a year and  a half ago newsprint  prices wereskyrocketing,  and  a lot of companies put through price increases  for home delivery  and at thenewsstand.  Now, in an environment  where newsprint  prices are plunging, I  asked whatnewspaper executives  were doing about pricing.  I was told that the savings  were  all going to3/25/97the advertisers.  Price competition  there was intense  and the volume  of ad space was upsharply, but the price of ad space  was substantially below where  it was a year ago--anindirect effect of how the marketplace  works.On the labor side, construction  unions are expecting  a 4 percent  average  yearlyincrease  over the next three  years.  They think their contract will be agreed  to by May andthat the increase will be higher than it was in the  contract for the three-year period currentlyending.  An interesting twist in the press about plant closings is that the Ford MotorCompany announced  that they were going to shut down their Lorain,  Ohio, operation andterminate the jobs of some  1,800 people.  The news stories  have said that these workers  werenot going to provide much relief to the tight labor markets  in the area.  That's because thesepeople  will collect 95 percent of a very high wage for a year  and they have the wrong  set ofskills for other employers.  One press report also said that auto  industry workers  had thewrong work ethic for what was needed by small  manufacturing  firms.Let me turn to the national economy.  I want to put a different twist on the notionof an opportunistic policy.  We  are experiencing  a favorable  productivity  surprise.  We donot know its precise  dimensions, but a lot of the anecdotal  reports  that we  hear certainlysuggest that it is occurring.  In some circumstances,  we  would expect  prices to decline.  If wewere  in a stable price environment--whether  it is a gold standard environment  or a stable fiatcurrency  regime--and  we had a favorable productivity surprise,  we would expect  the benefitsof that wealth gain to show up in higher standards  of living by way of lower prices.  In  aninflation-prone  environment,  we would expect  a lower rate  of inflation.  There  is nothing inthe mechanism  of the way individual  firms  operate that would by itself suggest to me highertotal nominal spending.  I think the connection between  what we see at the micro level  and3/25/97the macro level needs  unraveling, when we look at projections like those in the Greenbookthat show an  acceleration  in nominal spending  growth and in  total demand for output.We would expect  a favorable  productivity surprise,  other things the same, totranslate  into higher real interest rates.  In a stable  price environment  where  there is nodiscrepancy between  nominal  interest rates and real interest rates, the level of interest rateswould shift up.  In a fiat money world,  if monetary policy failed  to recognize  the changes inthe equilibrium  situation  and did not adjust nominal interest rates higher, then effectively, touse the language  we normally  employ, we would have eased monetary policy even if wemaintained  the same  level of nominal interest rates.  In my framework,  we would see anacceleration  in money growth,  and that would accommodate,  as in the Greenbookpresentation,  an acceleration  of nominal  spending  growth.  The second  difference would  goup.  But we know that the  second difference  has to come back down if we  are going toprevent an  acceleration  in  the rate  of inflation when that favorable productivity  surprisebegins to dissipate.  One thing we do not want to do is to accommodate  an acceleration  ofnominal  spending like the one that happened in the  1960s,  and I think that was a very largepart of the story  at the time.It has been disturbing for me to see that growth  in both narrow and broad moneymeasures  in virtually every major country in the world has  accelerated  in the last 4 to 6months.  Growth in some measures,  including high-powered  money, has risen into thedouble-digit  range.  A sharp acceleration  has occurred  in Japan, Canada,  and countriesthroughout Europe.  Now,  it may be that the world is experiencing  a productivity  surpriseand a global post-Berlin-Wall  marketplace  surprise,  but overall that should result in higherreal interest rates, not in higher rates of inflation.  It does  seem to me that our economic3/25/97analysis would lead us in the  direction of saying that we have to guard against passively andunintentionally  accommodating  an acceleration  of nominal income growth.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tenth District economy  continuesto grow at a robust pace.  As reported by our directors  and other business  contacts, growth isstrong  across the board in all District states and in just about all industries.  Ourmanufacturing  survey suggests that firms continue  to project strong production activity asthey look forward.  For example,  one of the high-tech firms, Sun Microsystems,  announcedplans to build a one  million square  foot plant in Denver and to add between  three  and fourthousand employees.  Reinforcing  some of this anecdotal evidence,  we know  that Districtemployment growth in the last year has been  somewhat higher than that for the nation as  awhole.  We know that bank credit has been  growing in our region;  it has been  down morerecently, but that is seasonal.  The farm  economy and the energy economy in the District areboth in good  shape for now.  One crop, winter wheat,  never has been in better shape in mostpeople's memory,  so there should be an  excellent harvest this year, assuming the weathercooperates.  In the drilling area, activity is very high, higher than  a year ago,  and even thoughboth oil and gas  prices have  slipped somewhat, our producers  remain profitable.  Retailprices generally  are holding steady, but wage  pressures  are continuing  to rise.  Most of ourdirectors  and other contacts  describe  our labor market as tight, and this includes  both oursmaller manufacturers  and some  of the  larger firms, such  as Boeing and Eastman Kodak, thathave operations  in the District.Nationally,  I think the best way for me to describe  our outlook is to say that we  arebasically in agreement with the direction  of the Greenbook forecast,  though we do not see as3/25/97much strength  in some of the components.  But in terms of where  we see real  growth,nominal  growth, employment levels,  and inflation,  we are fundamentally  in agreement.  Iwill  not comment more  specifically other than to note our concerns  about the inflationoutlook as presented in the Greenbook  and in our own projections.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  strong growth has  continued in the Twelfth  Districtin  recent months  following large gains  last year.  Although severe  winter weather slightlydisrupted  economic  activity in January, we have seen  indications  of a large bounceback  sincethen.  In  1996,  District payrolls expanded by about 3-1/2 percent.  Employment  growth inthe fastest  growing states--Nevada,  Arizona,  and Utah--currently is  averaging between  4-1/2and  7-1/2 percent.  I might note parenthetically  that Utah is perhaps the state  with the tightestlabor conditions in the entire nation; its  unemployment  rate is  3.2 percent.  I would also notethat if one  wants to find slack labor conditions,  I would like to  recommend  Alaska andHawaii,  which were 49th and 50th in terms of employment  growth, and you  could alsochoose a broad  spectrum  of weather as well.  [Laughter]Revised data indicate  that California's  recovery  accelerated  throughout  1996.California payroll employment  grew by 3 percent last year, well above  the 2.3 percent  raterecorded  in  1995.  The rate  of growth picked up in most areas of California  last year,  andalthough severe winter weather  held down employment  in January, the February numbersshowed  another large job gain.  The fastest growing  sectors in  California are high-techmanufacturing,  business services,  and engineering management  services, although  othersectors such  as construction, trade,  and real estate  are growing  steadily.3/25/97Turning to the national economy,  the concerns  I had in February  about theinflation outlook have been intensified by recent developments.  Real  GDP growth appears  tohave turned in another strong performance  this quarter following  a rapid advance  in thefourth quarter.  The  economy's surge in recent  quarters  means that it is operating at anoticeably higher level than  seemed likely only a few months  ago.  While judging resourceutilization is  difficult, the unemployment  and the capacity  utilization rates  as well asestimates of the GDP gap taken together  suggest that excess demand  pressures  most likelyare building in the economy.  A number of factors,  including the high dollar  and tight fiscalpolicy, seem likely to  slow growth later this year.  However,  I do not think the basic problemof excess demand  for resources  is likely to be solved anytime  soon with an unchanged  fundsrate.  Therefore,  I see a significant risk of an increase in underlying  inflation in the  yearsahead.  I emphasize  the word "risk" because  we have not actually  seen signs of risinginflation in the data.  This fact obviously  raises uncertainty  about the future.  For example,  itis difficult to judge the magnitude of possible roles  for enhanced productivity  and forchanges in the  labor market in holding down inflation.  However,  given the long lags inmonetary policy, we are left, I believe, with little choice but to use forecasts  in gaugingpolicy.  My best judgment  at this point is that even  with the measurement  improvementsbeing introduced by the BLS, the core CPI would still show  a modest upward trend this  yearand next if monetary policy remains unchanged.  Our forecast  shows core  CPI inflation ofaround 2-3/4 percent in 1997  and 3  percent in  1998 compared to just 2-1/2 percent last year.I do not think we  should risk an upward  trend in inflation because,  if it becomes established,it would be costly to turn around.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.3/25/97

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, the Seventh  District economy continues toexpand at a modest rate that is somewhat  slower than the nation's but its growth is consistentwith a regional economy that is  at full resource  utilization.  However, activity in a number ofsectors has been stronger  than expected  so far in  1997.  For example, both the light vehicleand  steel industries have been doing better than anticipated.  Production of light vehicles andsteel rebounded  in the first quarter following declines  related to the  strike in the fourthquarter.  On the demand  side, light vehicle sales were  stronger than expected in the firstquarter, although the Big Three  lost market share to foreign nameplates.  Orders  for steelhave remained strong.  Incentives  have been an  important  factor supporting  light vehiclesales, which appear to be continuing in March  at the higher-than-expected  rate of 15-1/4million units that we saw  in January and February.  In contrast to these price concessions,several steel producers  announced price  increases,  as Jerry Jordan  mentioned before.  Ourcontacts  are saying that these increases  have about a 50/50 chance  of sticking  at this point.Steel imports remain high and four new  domestic  plants will come  on stream in the next fivemonths.  They will add about  3 to 4 percent to steel capacity  in the United States this year.Of course, we do not know if any other plants will be closed as these new plants  areactivated.  Adjusting  as best we  can for the weather, housing  activity seems to have  beenslightly stronger than in the nation.  A large national  retailer reported that sales  in Marchcontinued in line with recent gains on  a year-over-year basis.District labor markets  are still very tight.  The unemployment rate  for Districtstates edged lower in January and averaged  4.3 percent in early March.  Initial  stateunemployment  insurance claims were  still running  well below  a year ago.  Payrollemployment  growth in our District is  lagging the nation, and contacts indicate  that labor3/25/97shortages  are constraining  both employment  and output  growth.  Our small business, labor,and agricultural advisory  council met last Friday,  and the members  almost unanimouslyreaffirmed  the difficulty of finding qualified  workers.  A representative  of the temporary  helpindustry mentioned  that computer programmers  are in extremely  short supply, andprogrammers  who know  any of the  older languages  such as COBOL that are needed to dealwith the year 2000 conversion problem  are receiving significant  premiums of up to 50percent over what programmers  would  normally be getting.  In addition  to the usual reasonscited as to why wages more generally  have not accelerated  significantly,  a representative ofthe United Automobile Workers  noted that dramatic  increases  in gain sharing, tied to eitherproductivity or profits,  were significant  for her union negotiations.Turning to agriculture,  Taiwan recently announced  that they were  halting all porkexports because of an outbreak of foot  and mouth disease.  Some  17  percent of all porkconsumed in Japan is  imported from Taiwan, and U.S.  exporters are now expected to fill alarge share  of this gap.  U.S.  hog prices have increased  sharply  since the  Taiwanannouncement of the ban last week,  and with little or no growth  projected in U.S.  porkproduction,  this is likely to put more pressure  on meat prices  this year.We have received an advance  copy of the Chicago Purchasing  Manager's surveyfor March, which is confidential until  it is released  next Monday, March  31.  The overallindex  for our area shows  a slight  acceleration in the rate of expansion, up from 56.2 ininflation measures  were mixed;  the prices-paid component  moved further above  50, while thesupplier-deliveries  component  dropped sharply to below 50.3/25/97Turning to the national  outlook, our assessment of the economy has changedsomewhat  since the February meeting.  We  still anticipate  that real  growth will deceleratesomewhat by the second  half of this year to  a pace  slightly above trend or at trend.  But weno longer believe  that current conditions  in the economy  are such as to guarantee  thatin February.  We  continue  to see a risk that demand pressures  will outstrip the growth ofproductive  capacity.  The  strength of demand  has been surprising  most of us since at leastlast summer.  Given  the maturity of the expansion,  one would  not expect  demand to begrowing so quickly without  some stimulus.  It is, of course,  difficult to know for sure, butthat stimulus  may stem from a monetary policy that is more expansionary  than we hadthought.  After all,  given  what we know about the lags  associated with monetary  policy, thetiming of the pickup in demand  corresponds roughly to the expected  effects of the actionsthat we took a little over  a year ago.  Those  actions made  sense at the time as insuranceagainst  what might have been  an overly weak  trend in demand,  but clearly  conditions  havechanged  and weak demand is no longer a concern.Finally, on the puzzle  of why we have not yet seen  appreciable wage  or pricepressures,  I believe the Chairman's  discussion of worker insecurity  provides  a useful  insight.As job insecurity, rising labor force participation  rates, and other temporary  damping forceswane, the balance  of risks tilts more clearly to the upside.  In sum, I agree with the overallpicture of the  economy depicted  in the Greenbook.

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  the New England economy  remains  quitehealthy.  In fact, it is healthier than we thought it was.  As I reported  before,  we had been3/25/97tracking  regional employment  growth at about half the national pace.  The spring benchmarkrevisions  to the employment data showed that, in fact, jobs were expanding  at just about  thenational  pace or about double  the rate that we had been seeing  earlier.  New Hampshire  andMassachusetts  are  exhibiting the  strongest growth;  Maine,  Vermont,  and Rhode  Island are  onthe low  side, and  even Connecticut  is showing surprising  strength.  The  region's jobless ratefell  to 4.2 percent  in February,  more than  a percentage  point below the national  rate.  Therates in all six states  were  below the national  average  in January,  with rates  in Vermont  andNew Hampshire  well below in the  3  to 3-1/2 percent range.The labor market  continues  to be tight for selected job categories, but thedefinition  of "selected"  seems to be broadening a bit.  More individual occupations  or jobtypes  are being mentioned  as hard to fill than in previous  periods.  Some retailers indicatethey are  experiencing recruiting  difficulties  even  at the low end  of the job skills spectrum,and temporary  employment  firms report both increased  difficulty meeting demand  and risingwages across the board.  Anecdotally,  I am told that an  employer no longer interviewsprospective  employees in the data communications  field; the  prospective employeesinterview the employer, and some will not even show  up in person  for an interview unless theanswers to their questions  over the telephone are responsive  to their concerns.  Thoseconcerns  are not just about money--they include  money, to be sure--but more  often than not,these technicians  want  to be assured of being involved in high-tech,  cutting-edge projects sothat their skills will continue to be marketable.  Contacts  also note that their firms  are usingsigning  bonuses and stock options to attract scarce  skilled staff but that those practices  arenot yet leading to across-the-board  wage  increases.  Rather, employees  with specific  skillsare  being paid more, while other employees  with less marketable  qualifications  "enjoy"3/25/97much  smaller pay increases.  Thus,  overall wages  are rising  a bit  more  slowly in the NewEngland  area than in the nation,  and we  continue to  hear that price increases  are difficult,  ifnot  impossible, to  make  stick.I have reported in the past  on the pickup  in nonresidential  construction  and theprospects  for more  nonresidential  building, particularly  in the  eastern  Massachusetts  area.Housing markets also are  enjoying a good bit of strength.  Realtors region-wide  have saidthat activity is picking up either in terms of actual  home  sales or the number of inquiries  frompotential  buyers.  Massachusetts  stands out with reports that  1996  broke  the previous record,set unfortunately  in  1987,  for the number of residential  real estate  sales in  a calendar  year.But contacts  say all the  New England states  are  seeing improvement.  Prices are  rising inresponse,  modestly as yet, and new  housing construction  has picked up.Turning to the national  scene,  we are  in general  agreement  with the Greenbookthat the near-term  outlook  for GDP growth  is  stronger than  we  might have expected earlierthis year and the risks associated  with inflationary  growth are  a bit higher.  Arguably  at least,the Greenbook  overstates  a little the strength  of the prospective  expansion,  and  the externalsector especially  could exert a stronger drag than  is projected  by the  staff.  In  addition,  ourestimate of potential  is a bit higher,  so we  do not  expect unemployment  to drop below  5percent  as does  the Greenbook.  But all of this falls by and large  into the category  of  "nitpicking."  The potential for robust, above-potential  growth  led by consumption  seems  clear,as are  the asymmetric  risks that capacity constraints  will  begin  to bind sooner rather  thanlater.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chair.

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  the Second Districteconomy has shown continued  signs  of strength in the first quarter.  Payroll job creationremains  sturdy, and job growth was revised up a bit for  1996 and early  1997.  New  YorkState's unemployment rate was  stable, while New Jersey's  fell to a six-year low.  Benchmarkrevisions to  1996 unemployment  rates were minimal,  though both civilian employment  andlabor force participation  were revised up substantially.  Retail  sales  generally were aboveplan, boosted in part by New  York State's one-week  tax  abatement  on clothing  in Januaryand by unseasonably mild weather  in February.  Consumer confidence  in the Middle  Atlanticregion surged  to a new  cyclical high in the first quarter,  but it remains  below the nationalaverage.  Residential  and commercial  real estate  markets continued to gain momentum earlythis year;  single-family home  sales improved, and permits to build apartments remained  onan uptrend.  In some of the region's tighter office markets,  falling vacancy  rates  have begunto push up asking rents.  Regional surveys of purchasing  managers were  mixed in February,but they generally signaled  improvement  in the manufacturing  sector.  In New  York andnortheastern  New  Jersey, consumer price inflation averaged  2.7 percent in the twelve monthsending in February,  down from 2.9 percent in  1996  and just below the national  rate of 3percent.  Local banks have reported little change  in loan demand  and only a  slight rise inconsumer delinquency  rates.On the national  level,  since  our last forecast in late  January, indicators of domesticdemand, labor markets, and production have  come in surprisingly  strong.  However,  the3/25/97international  trade data for January  were much weaker than we expected.  On balance,  wehave boosted our growth forecast  for this quarter to 2-1/2 percent  and for  1997 as a whole tonear 2-1/4 percent.  We do not have  quite the robust growth that the Greenbook  does for1998; we have  it at 2 percent, but we do believe that the upside risks  are  substantial.  Underour scenario, the unemployment  rate declines  to between 5 and 5-1/4 percent by the end ofthis year and  stays around that range for 1998.  Despite the continued  strength of realeconomic  activity, core consumer price  inflation has decelerated  further in the currentquarter,  and the rate of increase  in aggregate  labor compensation  is running well below thatpredicted by traditional Phillips curve models.  Nonetheless,  given  the current and expectedlevels of resource  utilization, we believe that  acceleration  of core inflation over the  forecasthorizon is the most likely outcome.  Indeed, while  we have pushed the  starting point of thatacceleration  further  out in the future,  we have  raised the rate of core inflation  expected to bereached  in  1998  to 3.3  percent on a Q4 to Q4 basis.There  are  three developments  since  our last meeting that have raised my staffsand my own concern  about inflation considerably  above the already increasing  level ofanxiety that I expressed  at our  last meeting.  First, the levels of consumer  spending, consumerconfidence,  and residential construction  are  so high that I believe the always  hard to predictwealth effect is kicking in  and is likely to remain engaged  even if there  should be a modeststock market correction.  Second, business  fixed investment seems unusually robust for thislate stage of the business  cycle,  and it shows up in areas  such as heavy truck orders  andinvestment in structures that make me believe that the business  executive will be joining  theconsumer  in increasing demand.  Third, we have benefited for several years  from a positivesupply shock in the form of slower increases in health benefit costs  than in wages that has3/25/97produced  an  acceptable  slope to the rise in the ECI.  Our sources of expertise--on  both thesupply and demand sides  of health care  and for both goods  and services--believe  that positiveperiod is behind us and that increases  in health care costs will track the  rise in the CPI in thefuture.  They, and we,  are not predicting a negative supply  shock but the end of the positiveshock.  That combination  of developments  makes me believe  that the risk  of rising inflationnext year and in  1999 has become  significantly  higher since our last meeting.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  The economic  picture  that emerges  in the Southeast has  manyparallels  to what is going  on nationally.  At the  same time, as I reported at the last meeting,the overall rate  of economic  expansion in our region  has settled back somewhat  from what itwas earlier in the expansion.  When I talk about some slowing,  it is from relatively high ratesof economic  growth.  As  elsewhere in the country, retail sales  in our area were stronger  thanexpected  during the mid-winter period.  Retailers  are optimistic  going forward  to Easter, andinventories  seem about right to them.  We  are seeing  some signs of a slowdown  in real estate,both residential  and commercial.  Exceptions  are in Nashville  and Atlanta where,  for the firsttime in this cyclical expansion,  a few  of my contacts in real estate  and banking  are expressingsome concern  about developers  who seem  to be  forgetting the lessons of the  1980s.  I willsave the stories  that go with that observation, but I have  heard some very  interesting storiesthat make the point.  I certainly  will watch that closely.  Some bankers  in Atlanta alsocommented  recently to me that they think the multifamily  market in Atlanta may be close to3/25/97being overbuilt. The  good news is that they are  going to pull back their lending  to that sector.Manufacturing,  too, seems  to have slowed  somewhat from  earlier in the expansion.  Ourown survey  of manufacturing showed  declines in the proportion of firms reporting  increasesin production,  shipments,  and new orders.  Employment, the average  workweek,  and theindex of expected  business activity  six months  out also declined,  and expectations  of futurecapital spending have  dropped off some since  our previous  survey.As Tom Hoenig mentioned for his area,  oil and gas activity is strong--in  Louisianain our case.  That activity  not only has  pushed the rig counts to  high levels, but it has broughtdemand  for crew boats  and other kinds of support spending to  higher levels.  We reported  atthe last meeting on signs that energy prices  would decline,  and that has happened,  as youknow.  One of our directors who is close to the natural  gas business noted that supplies havenow been rebuilt after the  drain from last year's harsh winter, and that should continue to putdownward pressure  on energy prices, particularly  natural gas, in the  period ahead.  Shipyardsalong the Gulf Coast report good orders.  One yard in Mobile is particularly excited  aboutgetting the  first order from Chinese interests;  it is for four large container ships.To be  sure, labor markets  remain tight in our area, with pressures  now evidentalmost uniformly  across our entire region.  The extraordinary  pressures  that we  saw in theTennessee  area have lessened  somewhat.  We still get very few reports  of unusually largeincreases  in wages, and  we still see  almost no signs of cutthroat attempts  to  steal workersfrom other companies.  We  are picking up  some reports  in our manufacturing  survey,  and Iwould underscore "some,"  of increasing pressures  on input prices  in the sense that they maybe beginning to see some  of that  also in finished good prices.  However, there  still is no realchange in most retail prices.3/25/97Finally  at the regional level,  we have two new  directors  this year from the retailautomobile industry--one  associated with a group of moderate-size  dealerships  and anotherwho ran the Alamo car rental company until  it was recently acquired  by one of the newconglomerates.  Those directors  suggested  at our last meeting that we are  seeing what theycall a "seismic"  shift in the retail auto business as the consolidations  that are under waycontinue.  They think the consolidations  will bring  significant efficiencies in operations  andan important  change  in the bargaining  power that dealers have  with manufacturers,  all  ofwhich they think should bode  well for the prices that consumers  will pay for autos  down theroad.At the national  level,  we like almost everyone  else have been surprised  by thepersisting strength in the economy early  this year.  We continue to expect  a slowdown in theexpansion later this year and we  hope we will not be disappointed.  We have not raised ourfourth-quarter  over fourth-quarter growth forecast  appreciably.  We expect growth  inexpenditures  on housing  and consumer durables  to be measurably slower as we move into therest of the  year.  We do not expect  unemployment to drop quite as low  as is  indicated in theGreenbook.  On the other hand,  and probably as a consequence,  we  also are not quite aspessimistic with respect to inflation, whether measured  by the CPI or the deflator.  We stillsee  few  signs of stress, excesses,  or imbalances except for persistent tightness  in laborupside.  My view stems mostly from the greater-than-expected  consumer spending that wecan readily see, fueled by either more borrowing,  lower saving  rates, or as Mike Prellreminded us again this morning, the possibility that we will  see some  additional  kick toconsumer spending  from the  stock market wealth effect.3/25/97One  offsetting risk on the downside,  as Cathy Minehan  also mentioned,  is ourview  that the outlook for exports could  change.  Should the dollar not fall  back or even risefurther, and we think that is certainly possible,  growth in exports could  be less than  iscurrently built into  the forecast.  There also remains the strong and growing  probability ofincreased wage  pressures,  although we  are less  sure than some that those  will be fully fedthrough to price inflation.  But again, on balance,  I think the risks are considerably  greater onthe upside.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  The Philadelphia District economy is operating  at a high level.Intense  competition,  however,  seems to be keeping the lid on wages  and prices.Manufacturing  is doing well; retail sales are  generally  good.  Commercial  real estate isshifting  from a buyer's  market to a seller's market.  Vacancy rates  are  going down; rents  andproperty values are  going up.  The incentive to build is picking up, and developers  areshopping for land.  Competition  for bank lending is  stiff, with the predictable  squeezing  ofdone by the bank down  the street.  The problem of one large  credit card issuer in the  Districtclearly  has had a sobering  effect on other issuers, but that  occurred too  late to avoid varyingdegrees of hangover for most of them.  I think the issuer that received the press  attentionprobably is more prone to problems and not as well  managed as  some of the others  in ourDistrict.Turning to wages  and prices, some  selected  wage hikes  are occurring.  On  thewhole, however, the wage/price  climate in the District remains  subdued.  One manufacturing3/25/97CEO I recently  spoke with, and I think she is representative  of manufacturers  generally,  saidemphatically that increases  in productivity  will continue  to absorb wage  hikes.Turning to the nation, the uncomfortable  uncertainty  that most of us have  feltaround the  table over the last six to nine months is partly explained, I think, by how peoplelook at the economy.  Most people  we talked with see the economy from their own point ofview.  They see business rolling in,  stiff competition,  and productivity  going up.  They alsosee  some labor shortages, but those  are the kinds  of problems they like to live with.  Now,that view  contrasts  with the macro  framework that  I think lays out the prospects for problemsdown the road.  It strikes  me that there is a greater divergence between  the person-in-the-street view  and this macro framework than  I have  seen  in a long time.  There is not muchappreciation,  I think, for that macro  framework view.  We have to weigh the risks, and mysense is that the  national economy  has considerable  self-feeding momentum.  Althoughinflation is remarkably  quiescent for now, I think the risks have  shifted fairly substantiallytoward the upside of too much demand  pressing against supply down the road.  With thestrong demand, I think the current federal  funds rate  almost surely means  that we  arepumping  too much  liquidity into the  economy.  It is the old pegging problem  that we know  sowell from the  past.  While patience has been wise,  I think some insurance  against overheatingmakes  sense now in order to keep the economic  expansion  on track.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stem.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Most measures  of economic  activity inthe  Ninth District remain  positive.  In particular, labor markets  are still  tight, and there arewidespread  labor shortages.  But we are at the point that this is so familiar, so much a part ofthe  landscape,  that people mentioned it only in passing.  Wage pressures  are there but they3/25/97are scattered  and by no means overwhelming.  With regard to other District developments,construction activity is positive, the  manufacturing  sector is doing well,  and state taxrevenues are  running well above what  had been  anticipated.  A major potential negative is theweather.  Widespread  flooding is anticipated in the spring, but for better or for worse, thesnow  and ice have not started to melt yet.As  far as the national economy is concerned,  I certainly agree with the significantupward revisions in the Greenbook  forecast,  and I think, if anything, they may beconservative.  My sense of the dynamics  of the situation  is that the economy  will probably--and will  certainly without a change in policy--grow  at the higher pace of the latest forecast  oris that there is considerable  room  for some significant  spending on  inventories  going forwardand that such  spending will probably  add significantly  to aggregate demand.As  I think about financial conditions and the broad range of variables that onemight throw into that bucket, it seems to me that  financial  conditions remain  verycomfortable  whether we look at interest rates,  growth in the broad measures of money, equityprices--even  though they have waffled  a bit recently--or  credit availability  in general.  As  Isee  it, we have financial  conditions that are consistent with further substantial  expansion indemand.Finally, as  far as  inflation is  concerned, I  agree that a variety of temporary  factorshas worked  so far to restrain inflation to a pace that is certainly  lower than  I would haveexpected  at this point in the expansion.  I think that may continue for some time.  Inparticular,  I would point to the state  of many of the other major industrial economies  aroundthe world where  there is considerable  slack.  In my view, that has been  an important  factor in3/25/97what has been going  on here.  But having said that, I would emphasize  that the factors thathave been restraining inflation are  certainly  temporary and  that the inflationary  risks areclear.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  We have all been watching this remarkable  economy  with somepuzzlement  for the last  several months.  Until now, the signs  of strength in the privatedomestic  economy  always  seemed to be  mixed with some signals that the expansion  might beslowing  down.  What strikes  me at this  point is that the signs  of a slowdown  are  nearlyabsent.  Virtually all the statistics  at the national level point to continued  strength.  Thispattern is reflected almost uniformly in the reports from around the nation, although thereport for Atlanta sounds  a little different.  Labor markets  are tight;  employment is  movingup; labor participation  is high; the workweek is longer;  initial unemployment  claims aredown; all these indicators  reinforce  the good jobs picture.  Consumer  spending is strong;inventories  are lean;  business investment, housing, and nonresidential  construction,  youname it, look good.  It just does not look like an  economy  that is running  out of steam.There  are two elements  of restraint.  One is  the federal budget, which is modestlyrestrictive.  I think the outlook for fiscal  policy is probably  the biggest difference between thisyear  and back in  1965.  I remain fairly optimistic that we will  get a budget deal, but weprobably will not get it until August or September.  There  is no pressure of an  election to keepthe  Congress from trying  hard to finish its work and get home,  so the debates  will probablystring  out.  But I think the budget deal will get done without a government  shutdown  andwithout a continuing resolution,  and  the agreement  is likely to include  a modest CPI fix,agreed  to very quickly  at the very end of the legislative process.  In that regard,  I think there3/25/97was  an overreaction  to the President's rejection of the commission idea.  With all due  respectto the  Chairman,  they do not need a commission;  they just need to fix the  CPI.  My guess isthat they will  do something.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Okay, let's do it!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  The long-run effect depends  on whether the budget  legislationincludes significant reductions  in the growth  of Medicaid  and Medicare.  I think the chancesare quite good that it will.  Nevertheless,  the effects  will be mostly psychological  andpossibly not particularly  strong even there.  The real effect of having  a deal is not going to bevery great in the near term.The other negative that  has been  mentioned and is much bigger in its effect is netexports.  This clearly is helping restrain the economy at the moment, but it is exacerbatingthe long-run  problem of the current account deficit for which we have no obvious solution  atthe moment.  The case for viewing this economy  as just a little too robust to be sustainable  isthe clearest  one that I have  seen  since I have served on the Board;  admittedly  that has notbeen very long.  A small move to restrain  growth and the future  acceleration of inflation  thatseems  increasingly  likely could prolong  this remarkable  expansion,  and that  seems to me tobe what we ought to want to do.  I do not see very  much downside  risk.  If we had a sharper,better policy instrument that operated more immediately, we could certainly  afford to wait,but unfortunately we do not.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  The Eighth District economy continues  to  operateat a high level.  Contacts  report little or no change in the growth rate  of economic  activity inthe past few  months  and continue  to be optimistic about the  near term.  With unemployment3/25/97rates  well below the national  level, labor markets remain tight in much of the District,especially for construction workers.  Payroll employment  increased at a 2.3 percent  annualrate  for the three months ended  in January,  a rate  not seen since October  1995  and well abovethe  1-1/2 percent average  rate posted  in  1996.  Second-quarter  District  auto production  isexpected to be up more than  10 percent from the  first-quarter level.  Early  1997  sales taxreceipts  are up substantially  in the District from their year-ago levels, suggesting  strongeconomic  activity, particularly  at the retail level.  Residential  and commercial  constructionactivity has  stayed relatively  strong,  although January residential permits  dropped from theiryear-ago  levels  in most District metropolitan  areas.  About  120  counties in Arkansas,Indiana,  Kentucky, and Tennessee  have been declared  federal  disaster areas as  a result of thetornadoes,  heavy rains,  and flooding that occurred  in early March.  Although reliableestimates  of damage  are not yet available,  federal  disaster assistance is expected to lead tonew home construction by displaced residents.  That was the experience  after the major  1993floods  in the Midwest.At the national level, forecasters  see continuing expansion.  A burst ofconsumption growth  is expected  in the current quarter,  which will be the highest  quarterlyincrease  in consumption  since the end  of 1992  if the  staff forecast of 5  percent growth at anannual  rate is realized.  The run-up  in stock prices  and the high level of confidence  reportedin consumer surveys  as well as early reports on retail sales  and residential  constructionsupport this conclusion.  On the one hand, such an  outlook suggests that the  downside risksfor the economy  are  limited in the short run.  On the other, the longer-run  inflation  outlook isnot so sanguine.  Despite  moderate decreases  in PPI and CPI inflation  so far in  1997, there isa heightened  concern  about an inflationary impulse  emanating from observed price  increases,3/25/97a tight labor market,  and  a continuing  easy credit market.  In addition,  we have seenanecdotal  evidence  along the  lines of what Bill McDonough  mentioned with respect to theapparently shifting pattern  of health  care  cost increases  from a declining to a rising trend thatwill no longer tend to offset at least a portion of the wage increases.It does  not seem to me that the current stance of monetary policy will mitigate theinflation  impulse that I outlined.  Growth  rates in the broad monetary  aggregates,  whichconceivably  are back on track, are running at or above our announced  targets.  The yieldcurve has steepened  further, increasing  the likelihood  that the federal  funds rate target is toolow to prevent further acceleration  in monetary  growth.  All told, the longer-term  inflationtrend may be a lot less favorable  than the 3  percent norm of most forecasters.  My reading  ofthe economy supports the conclusion that we  are at risk of losing the hard-won credibility ofour commitment  to hold inflation  at 3 percent. In the  current situation, it is vitally importantthat we act to preempt prospective further increases  in inflation  and thereby avoid thesubstantially  higher costs of having to  do a lot more policy tightening later.

MR. MCTEER.  The economy in  the Eleventh District remains healthy.  Whiledata for January  showed  an actual  decline in  District employment levels, I am inclined  todiscount  those figures because  of weather-related  factors and because they  are inconsistentwith the anecdotal  evidence that we have  been getting from all our boards  of directors  andadvisory councils.  The composition of growth in the Eleventh  District has  shifted somewhat.Last year's downturn  in the computer  chip industry  seems to be behind us,  and the industryis once  again announcing  expansion plans.  Job gains in our District's semiconductorindustry are  expected  to be about  10 percent  this year,  offsetting the losses of last year.3/25/97As  both Tom Hoenig and Jack Guynn mentioned  for their Districts,  oil and gasdrilling continues to move forward at all-out, full capacity.  The rig count in Texas  is 20percent  above a year ago.  Shortages  of rigs  and crews continue to be reported.  There is awidespread  feeling that the drop in oil prices over the last few months will not result in anydrilling slowdown because  it is the use  of new technology  that is making drilling profitable  atprices  anywhere  above $18.  The use of 3-D seismic  techniques  has drastically  reduced thenumber of dry holes, both on land and at sea, if you can imagine a dry hole at  sea.[Laughter]The construction  sector showed signs  of slowing over the last few  months insingle-family  and multifamily homes, industrial  and warehouse  space,  and retail shoppingcenters.  Office construction  continues to rebound  from fairly low  levels, and a large numberof medium-size projects  have been announced  recently, especially  in far north Dallas.  Imight add that when  I moved to Dallas six years  ago,  this was the very region  that had thegreatest concentration  of RTC  properties in Texas.  Obviously,  the glut is over.  This hasbeen  reflected  in rising commercial  rents in the suburban  areas.  There  are even  scatteredreports  that prices of prime  shopping center property  have doubled over the last year or so.We continue  to see signs  that the Mexican  economy  is coming back, although  thereapparently is  still more slack in Mexico than in Utah.  [Laughter]  Warehouse  space inLaredo  is fully leased, and reports are  coming in from both our border and inland  cities thatMexican  shoppers  are returning.  However, retail  sales to Mexicans  remain belowpre-devaluation  levels, partly because Wal-Mart and other U.S. retailers have  opened outletson the Mexican  side  of the border.3/25/97As for wage  and price pressures in the District, it seems like the same song,seventh verse.  Wages  overall  appear to be increasing  on a slowly rising gradient, butexceptions  to this  generalization  have been  reported with increasing frequency.  Still, theyare sporadic  exceptions  against the backdrop of a steady trend.  As for pressures  on finalprices  of goods and services,  we hear an unending story  that competitive pressures negate  theability  of business  firms to pass cost increases  forward.Turning to the national economy, it is difficult  to find signs of weakness  orimbalances.  The inflation picture  in the Eleventh  District is a reflection of the trends I seenationally.  Consumer and producer  price increases have  been  subdued.  The broaderinflation measures  look even better.  As  for inflation  in the pipeline,  gold and commodityprices  do not suggest too many reasons to be concerned.  M2 growth  does, however, remainon the high side, perhaps  as a result of the pegging  problem that Ed Boehne mentionedearlier.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

MR. MEYER.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I want to focus on two key questionsabout the outlook that I believe  should  shape our decision about  monetary policy today.First, how does the  economic environment,  meaning both the recent data and the currentforecast, differ today from that prevailing  at the July and September FOMC meetings--whichin my judgment were  the closest calls for a tightening of policy--and  more generally fromthat prevailing for the  entire recent period of the asymmetric  policy directive?  Second, howdo today's forecasts  for  1997 by members of the FOMC  compare to the central tendencies  ofthe forecasts  for the year that the members  submitted at the February  meeting and that wereincorporated  in the  Humphrey-Hawkins  report?3/25/97This focus presumes that any  change in policy we contemplate  today would  reflecta change in the FOMC members'  readings  of the fundamentals  and risks in the  economicoutlook.  That would be the natural assumption.  However,  the comments of at least  somemembers at the last meeting could be interpreted as  indicating that they already  had changedtheir view  about monetary policy but thought that a tightening  should be postponed  until thismeeting to allow an opportunity  to prepare  the market.  And the market certainly has beenprepared!  [Laughter]  For myself, however,  some trigger, some change  in the fundamentals,is necessary to push me  to accept  a change in policy.  I will focus here on whether or notthere has been  such a change in  fundamentals.Let me remind  you of the basic framework  that has underpinned  my judgmentabout monetary  policy during this period.  I worry about two risks to the inflation  outlook:the utilization  and the growth risks.  The utilization risk  refers to the possibility that theprevailing  utilization rates  may already be so high that inflation  will rise over time.  Thegrowth risk relates to the possibility that future above-trend  growth  will raise  utilization  ratesstill further, thereby aggravating the risk of higher inflation.  Given  the uncertainty  abouthow to judge utilization rates,  we have  tempered  our inclination to be forward-looking  in ourpolicy actions  and have  given added  weight to recent data on inflation  and labor costs.  Thereis, nevertheless,  a causal chain that I believe  we have been  relying on--from growth relativeto trend, to utilization  rates, to wage  changes,  and finally to inflation.  There  are, to be sure,complications  associated with changing  profit margins, possible  change  in the productivitytrend, favorable  or unfavorable  supply shocks,  and change in threshold levels of utilizationrates.  But this causal  chain is and must be at the heart of preemptive policy.3/25/97Policy could be said to be more forward-looking  or preemptive  the more  willingwe are  to act earlier in this causal chain.  The importance I attach to this causal chainnecessitates  a response  to the flurry of disclaimers  around  this table at the last meeting aboutthe usefulness  of NAIRU.  I intended to respond then but, frankly, I somehow  got distracted.[Laughter]  As the most enthusiastic champion  of the NAIRU concept  around this table, letme briefly respond now because  I think that concept  is relevant to our decision  today.The concept fundamentally involves  three  principles.  First,  a major proximatesource of higher inflation  is excess demand in the labor and/or product markets.  Second,  thecausal  chain is most likely to proceed from excess  demand in the labor market,  to wagechanges  and hence labor costs,  and finally to  price inflation.  Third, as long as the excessdemand  prevails, inflation  continues  to rise progressively  and indefinitely  over time.  Ifrankly would be shocked  if most of us around this table did not believe  in these principles.To be sure, applying them has become  more  difficult of late because  the impliedrelationships  have not been nearly  as tight as had been the case earlier.  There are data thatsuggest some decline  in the NAIRU.  Nevertheless,  these principles must in my view be theframework  for conducting  a disciplined  monetary policy, and I believe that is central to anyNow back  to the outlook:  What is different today  in the data and/or the  forecastcompared  to what we had at FOMC meetings during the period of asymmetric  directives?To  set up my  later discussion  of my position  on monetary policy, I will organize  thediscussion from the perspective of the Taylor Rule.  A rough summary  is that currentutilization rates are about the same and core  inflation is lower.  Unlike at earlier meetings,the forecast now shows  continued above-trend  growth immediately  ahead  and, as a result,3/25/97higher utilization rates  over the next year or two.  The current  Greenbook projection  of ameeting, though I would  argue that this  forecast is more believable  now for many of us.  Atthe February meeting, both the  Greenbook and FOMC  members were projecting near-trendgrowth over  1997, but the FOMC members were  forecasting  stable unemployment rates incontrast to the decline projected  in the Greenbook.  The current  data on utilization  rates andcore  inflation are no more alarming now  than earlier, and perhaps  less so.  So, if we want tojustify action today, we have  to look at an earlier stage  of the causal chain.In his recent testimony, the  Chairman has focused  on labor market  indicators asbeing of special importance  in reaching  a decision  for a preemptive move, and  I agree.  Letus take  stock here.  The data on compensation are  somewhat mixed, but they suggest someacceleration on balance.  The latest  12-month increase  in average hourly  earnings is  1/4 to1/2 percentage point  higher than  had prevailed at the time of the July and Septembermeetings.  On the other hand, the increases  in average hourly earnings were  rather tame inthe last couple of months.  There  is certainly a hint here but hardly a smoking  gun.  On theother hand, virtually  all other indicators  of labor market tightness  are at more elevated levelstoday: help wanted ads  are up, initial claims for unemployment  insurance  are down, the indexof hard-to-get jobs is down,  and consumer sentiment  about jobs being plentiful is up.  But thekey to our decision today  is the change in the forecast.Ill focus now on the Greenbook forecast, which  may be more  aggressive in certainrespects  than some  of our own forecasts.  This will effectively  serve to make more dramaticthe point I want to make.  There  is a significant change in the current  Greenbook forecast for1997 from the forecasts prepared  for the July and September meetings  and even that for the3/25/97percent rate of growth over  1997  in contrast to just above  2 percent at the  July and  Septembermeetings  and 2-1/4 percent  at the February  meeting.  This follows  an unexpectedly  strongsecond half of 1996.  To be sure, as is almost always the case in such projections, growthslows to trend over the forecast period.  But the combination  of a stronger second  half of1996 and an upward revised forecast  for  1997 translates into an increase  in the level  of outputand hence  utilization rates in  1997  and  1998.  At the July and September  meetings,  theunemployment  rate was expected to stabilize  near 5-1/2 percent  for  1997.  Now it is expectedto decline to 5  percent this year and below 5 percent  in  1998.  Just to underline the difficultyin making and selling any  policy change,  the other important  difference  in the Greenbookforecast is that inflation  for  1997 has been revised downward relative  to the July  andTo repeat the  second question, how did we FOMC  members  change our forecastsfor growth  over  1997 and  the unemployment rate  at the  end of this year compared  to thecentral tendencies  of the forecasts  that we submitted for incorporation  in theHumphrey-Hawkins  report?  For my part, I see the economy as having more near-termmomentum than I did at the last meeting, and therefore  I now expect the unemployment rateto be lower in the second half of the year and into  1998.  As a result, I have  revised upwardmy expectations  for inflation over  1998.

MR.  KELLEY.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  For a number of meetings now, theeconomy has seemed to be deja vu.  For some  time, we have felt that we were  looking at afully utilized economy, one with tight and tightening labor markets that seemed  likely to3/25/97begin to show escalating labor costs and from there  escalating inflation--in  short, anoverheating  economy.  But that has not happened  so far.  In fact,  inflation is flat to downaccording to many statistical  series.  Our expectation has been  that the expansion would slowto growth at about trend and that this might allow us to experience  a quiescent inflation ratefor some period  of time or indefinitely.  This is a very rosy scenario.  It  certainly has  seemedquite plausible, and it has been working  for a long time.  Our policy has been  to stay alert,stay asymmetric,  but basically to wait and see.  While  I have never been very comfortablewith it, I certainly  have been  solidly  in that camp.But now I think the  very strong first quarter that we seem to be experiencing  callsinto question the continued  viability of that  scenario.  Growth for the past four quartersincluding  this one is going to be somewhere  in excess of 3-1/2  percent.  That is certainly  wellbeyond anybody's  estimate of potential in  an economy whose resources  already  seem to befully utilized.  And it now seems  that there is very little that is likely to slow that growthmaterially.  We talked about  all the factors this morning: job formation  and the purchasingpower that it creates, surprisingly  strong construction,  both residential  and nonresidential,sky-high consumer  confidence with jobs plentiful,  and supportive  wealth effects.  Ifconsumer  spending  should slow in the near future, I think we probably would get aninventory pop that would keep  things going.  Certainly, there is a potential for slower growthif we were to get a stronger dollar or a bear stock market.  There are other potential  shocks Iam  sure, but they seem to have a considerably lower probability.The very strong and persistent job formation that we have  seen  is very likely in myview to start to take its toll on costs.  The unemployment  rate has been  held up as high as itis by the fact that the labor force has been growing at an unexpectedly  high rate.  The labor3/25/97force participation  rate is now  at a record high, I believe,  or very close to it.  If the rapidgrowth of the labor force  were  to slow, the unemployment rate would probably go  downsubstantially  and costs  would probably and perhaps  inevitably rise.  But if that labor forcegrowth  somehow continues,  we will have to wonder about the quality of the new labor andwhat  is going to happen to productivity  and costs  as a result.  Certainly, there is some othercombination  of potential developments  in the labor market.  Some employers  who are notchasing  their firm's stock price  will simply restrain production,  slow growth  down ratherthan allow  their costs to rise.  I am sure that many  will be able to keep their productivitygrowing.  There are  employers who are causing jobs to migrate to lower cost areas,  though itlooks  as if Utah is off the list.  [Laughter]  Many  are going offshore.  That is happening,  butwe have  to wonder whether there is likely to be  enough of that to affect  aggregate indicatorsof economic  performance.  There certainly  are a lot of things or combinations  of things  thatcould stretch  out the benign era that we are in.  But given what we see happening  in theeconomy right now, what we  know  about the utilization rate of economic resources,  and whatseem to me  to be the highest probabilities in coming quarters,  it may soon be time for us toconsider pulling up  stakes and moving the camp to higher ground.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips, I think you better talk now.3/25/97

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  My goodness.  Well,  I guess  I am batting cleanup here.  Lastmonth  we were trying  to determine  whether the  returns for the fourth quarter of 1996 andearly  1997 constituted a temporary burst of energy  and the economy  was about to settle downto the proverbial  sustainable growth trend or whether those developments  marked thebeginning  of a stronger growth path.  It does appear that we have a bit more confirmation inthe direction of the latter  than last time.  In addition, as Governor  Meyer mentioned, we havecome out of 1996  with an  economy that is operating  at a higher level.  So, additional  growthcould put  significant strain on  our product and labor markets.The areas of economic  strength that  have been confirmed  since our last meetinginclude consumer spending, which is supported by increases in income from a strong  laborin the fourth quarter, but it is now showing  signs of reviving or at least continuing to operateat a relatively high level.  In the business  sector, we have persisting strength in profits andcash flows, restructured  balance sheets, and  reasonably priced capital.  I see no reason toexpect  a slowdown in expenditures  for equipment or structures.  With  demand holding upand  space shortages  developing,  we may continue  to see strength in constructionexpenditures  with follow-along equipment purchases.  If anything, inventories  are lean,  sothe goods-producing  industrial  sector should be able to maintain its momentum.  This rosyscenario does  not mean  that the business  cycle is dead, just that it is a long cycle.Some of the stories that we see concerning the industrial  sector are in a senseshowing  a little more creativity.  I would point to the Business Week article this week thatindicated the technology  industry is  about to "tank."  I must say that I have  a hard timeswallowing  that story.  Granted the technology  industry  is competitive and some fallout  is3/25/97likely to occur among producers,  the fundamentals  for continued  demand  for information  andcommunications  technology  are  not going to disappear.The monetary  aggregates,  although we  have not been talking much about themrecently, are  confirming the economic strength.  I believe that  the industrial  sector is awarethat it is  about time for us to remove the punch  bowl.The only area of weakness in the economy that has been confirmed  since  the lastmeeting  is net exports.  Although  this sector is somewhat of a drag on U.S.  growth,  strengthin the domestic economy  significantly  mitigates the effect.  Another area, which GovernorRivlin mentioned, is the fiscal situation.  In a sense, stronger  economic growth is improvingthe chances  of a successful  budget deal.Turning  to inflation,  although ostensibly  it appears fairly benign,  I would arguethat there are  growing  signs of latent or pipeline pressures.  I would point to average  hourlyearnings  of non-supervisory  production  workers.  The anecdotal  stories of labor shortagesand wage pressures  are  increasing,  and employers  certainly are  getting more creative.  I hopethat productivity  improvements  will contain labor cost pressures, but it seems to me thatthere  are  some limits to this process.  Governor Kelley referred to that issue.  There  are somecommodity price pressures  showing up:  President Moskow  mentioned hogs, certainly aprime  commodity to which attention  should be paid; other commodity price pressures  may beseen in metals, lumber, and coffee.  There  also seems  to be a lot of testing of thesustainability of price increases.  With energy prices  easing off, it is hard to know exactlyhow quickly any of these  pipeline pressures  will show through to the CPI, but it seems  to methat we  have moved further into the inflation  alert zone.3/25/97

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions for Don?  If not, let me start off.  It  isquite evident that  we have come to a point, as we suggested  we might at the last meeting,where as Don put it--how did you put it?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  "Deliver."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We have to  "deliver."  Let me, however,  review  thevarious  aspects  of what is going on  and try to put them into a policy context,  which I thinkwe need to fashion fairly  carefully.  Let me start with something that has not been  discussedvery much around the table this morning.  The proposition  that inflation  has stopped falling isnot readily  provable.  That may seem to be a rather ridiculous  statement, but if we  look at thedata, what we see is that the rate of inflation, no matter how we look at it, has been  edginglower with some bumps  here and there.  Even if we add back  the BLS  adjustments,  thatconclusion  is not changed  significantly; it certainly  is not changed  with respect to the GDPchain-weighted index and the like.  The reason is very clearly that productivity  is badlyunderestimated  and indeed may actually be accelerating.  If we start with the proposition thatprice levels  are moving up very modestly,  that domestic  operating profit margins  are stableor maybe  slightly improved,  and that consolidated  nonlabor costs in the nonfinancial3/25/97corporate  sector are going nowhere, we  necessarily end up with the  conclusion that on aconsolidated  basis unit labor costs in the nonfinancial  corporate  sector, as I mentioned  at thelast meeting, are not moving very  much, if at all.  Since we know what compensation  perhour is doing, it necessarily  follows that productivity  has to be rising almost as  much as thecompensation  numbers.  Indeed, all the anecdotal  stories  that we hear tend to confirm  that.This suggests, as Mike Prell pointed out, that we may finally be getting  the productivity  gainsthat many have anticipated  from the synergies  created by the rapidly developing  computertechnology  information structure.  The gains surely  seem to be showing up in a lot of areas,and  it is very difficult to understand  the profitability numbers  we are looking  at without somereference  to significant improvements  in productivity.  The reported  per share profit figures,  Ishould add, are stronger than domestic operating earnings  despite the fact that the dollar hasbeen firming.  That's because  the earnings  of foreign affiliates,  which  are a  significantportion of both the  S&P 500 index  and the NIPA data,  have been rising rather strongly andindeed have been  an increasing  share  of total profits over the last couple  of years.  So, wehave  to discount the reported profits  at least slightly.  But even  after doing that, we still get asense that the  rate of increase in operating profits  of domestic  firms probably impliesmodestly  accelerating  productivity.The reason why manufacturers  in particular and business people more generallyhave  the view that inflation  is dead and the economy is in  a new era is that that is the way itfeels  to them.  In other words,  if we examine  individual company accounts,  we find thatbusiness firms are offsetting their cost increases  fairly aggressively  and quite successfully.They are not able to raise prices.  Pricing power  is gone,  and the reason it is gone,  as we havediscussed previously, is that competitors have  sufficiently  high rates  of return  to enable  them3/25/97to undercut  price increases  and go for market share, should some  firm try to raise its prices.This also implies that a degree of slack still exists in the system  that all these business  peoplecan see.  You can  speak to any  of the most sophisticated  corporate  managers,  and you  willget exactly the same story.  The  answer, of course, is that as  sophisticated and  farseeing asthey may be, their time frame  is too  short for the purposes  of monetary policy.  Indeed,  as wemight put it  in a macro sense, there are  certain realities that are consistent  with perceptions  ofthe individual  companies  but inconsistent  with the macro data.First of all, it is pretty clear at this stage that the tightness  in labor  markets isincreasing.  Initial  claims  for insured unemployment  continue at  a very  low level,  showing  nosigns of turning up.  Insured unemployment  data have moved  off the previous  track  and havegone down.  Help-wanted  advertising,  which  admittedly is not the world's  most reliablestatistic, has  suddenly perked up in recent months  in a way that we have not seen  for anumber  of years.  Most importantly,  as a number of you have  pointed out, labor forceparticipation  now  seems to be rising after being  stagnant.  And if we look  at the internalstructure  of the  workforce, we see that employers  are hiring  marginal workers.  The  first signof some labor market pressure is that new workers  are recruited  from outside  the labor force.The problem is  that there is no way to increase the  working  age population, which meansthat we can  expand our labor resources  only up to a point.  We then run out of qualifiedpeople  to hire.  The numbers  in this regard look quite impressive.  We also are  seeing thataverage  weekly hours are  moving up,  and in a sense we are running out of space to expand,at  least in terms of labor market resources.  The reason I emphasize  this is that it is  farsimpler to evaluate  capacity  use in the labor market  than capacity use of other producerresources,  and since either labor or capital utilization limits can restrain  economic growth, we3/25/97need not  argue that both constraints  are  in place.  All we need is for one to be exerting aconstraining effect and labor  supply clearly is.It is very difficult to  see the emergence  of resource  constraints  in the  nonlaborstructure.  The reason, of course,  is that advancing technology  has created  a degree  offlexibility that we never had before.  Not  only can  business  firms now produce  customizedproducts  in small batches through computerized  and rationalized  production  techniques thatthey did not have previously, but they can also add  features  or take them away--do  whateverthey want--in a way they never had the flexibility to do before.  This means  that the conceptof capacity  is far more  flexible than ever.  The only way that we can detect  obviousdifficulties  or pressures is by watching  such things as lead times  on deliveries, overtimehours, or other measures  of tightness  that are symptoms  of the difficulty of using the existingstate of technology to adapt capacity  and facilities to unanticipated  developments.  One waybusiness firms have accomplished  all of that is by moving to a quite  remarkable just-in-timeinventory system.  They  have tightened  the production system to a point where,  as part  of itsflexibility, they have the capability of essentially  not having inventories  other than  work inprocess.  Indeed, part of the improvement  in productivity  has resulted from  squeezing  downthe way businesses  use resources.  As  a consequence,  inventories  measured in terms of days'supply at factory value are now at very low levels.The reason I raise the  issue of factory value is that when we are looking at ademand system, the markup of inventories in the distribution  channels  is not a truly relevantconsideration.  We are  interested  in the number of shoes in  the distribution channel  if we arecalculating  production;  we  are not interested  in the constant dollar value of those inventoriesbecause  that will  change depending on where they are in the production  and distribution3/25/97process.  While  I may exaggerate  when  I say that the  markup for the inventories  is not all thatimportant,  it nonetheless is not as valuable in measuring  the tightness  of supply  and demandas the factory value numbers.  For purposes of measuring GDP, the markup obviouslyincreases  value added,  which  is why we calculate it, but it does not give us information aboutthe  supply of shoes.  It just tells  us what the value  added has been in the  distribution process.One  problem with just-in-time  inventory systems is that resource  use is  verytight.  Consequently,  if anything abnormal  emerges,  there is a marked  rise in delivery leadtimes or bottlenecks.  All of a sudden people  who think just-in-time inventory  managementis terrific find that they now need to add  some safety  stocks.  What happens is that theinventory pattern then begins  to turn around even  though days'  supply may not go up verymuch.In  the current situation,  since  inventory-sales  ratios at factory  value have beencoming down in general,  inventory  investment could go up quite abruptly.  As a consequenceof such a development, there  is a very clear underlying tightness in the current inventorysituation  that is creating  significantly  more risk on the upside than we had earlier, certainlymore than in the  summer of 1996 when  inventories had backed up and there was  a degree ofslack in the  system.  That slack has essentially been  pulled out of the system  at this stage.It is very  hard to believe  that personal consumption  expenditures  are notsignificantly  affected by the wealth  effect.  Leaving  aside the econometrics,  I think thatwhenever we get as  huge an increase  in financial  market wealth as  we have gotten, people atsome point begin to believe that it is permanent.  They  start thinking that it is not going todisappear right away and that they are now in a sense  richer.  That attitude begins  to have  animpact on consumption  expenditures.  Indeed, if we look at the decline in risk premiums3/25/97and/or the cost of capital, what that means  essentially is that we are progressively discountingthe future less.  If we examine the normal processes by which time-dependent  investmentsare made,  as the risk premiums  and the discount factors  fall, we see  that production isbrought  up front from the future.  Capital assets are produced  today on the basis  of expectedreturns  much further in the future than was true in the previous periods.  As the riskpremiums  fall, the time preference moves into the future and picks  up additional  currentdemand.  I think we are  seeing that in  consumption expenditures  and in home  sales.Let me just add parenthetically  that awhile back I discussed the discrepancybetween the  level of home  sales and the levels  of housing starts  and permits.  What we wereobserving was that the level of starts was being supported  by declines in permit backlogs  andthe level of permits was being held down by sales  drawn out of housing inventories.  I amtalking about single-family  homes.  We now are seeing for the first time at least some pickupin the permit backlogs.  This  indicates  that sales  of single-family homes  out of existingstocks  finally  are beginning to induce builders to take  out more permits for new homeconstruction.  While I certainly grant that the February data were  an aberration,  they do tendto suggest that housing  activity may not be moderating.Certainly,  plant and equipment expenditures  are crucially  related to this timepreference  issue and  are undoubtedly  being affected by the evidently continuing rise in theprices of commercial  real estate  and the quite pronounced  decline in vacancies,  especially  insuburban  areas.  We are beginning  to see some upward  movement in commercial rents.Having said all  of that, we are  not at this stage moving into what I would describeas an overheated boom.  We are  short of that.  For example, it is certainly the case thathomebuilding is at a relatively high level, but it is not accelerating.  Motor vehicle  sales, I3/25/97think,  are a little softer than Mike Moskow was suggesting.  Our reading of the same peoplehe spoke to a week ago comes  out with a  slightly smaller number.  Chain  store sales  havetended to flatten out.  In other words, this economy is  not running  away to a degree  thatwould suggest we have to hold everything  in place.  What we have  at this stage is a situationthat is clearly evolving  over time.  In fact,  as I said at the beginning of my comments, we stilldo not have concrete evidence  to suggest that the  inflation rate has stopped  going down.  Inthis situation, we can allow ourselves  a fairly considerable  amount of time to act.  Therefore,I do not  think that there is any particular urgency  to move in a very aggressive  way.  I dothink we have to move, but I don't think that we  have to be concerned  about being behind thecurve  in any measurable  way.Certainly, there are  some principles  that clearly need to be kept in mind here.  Oneis that recent experience  tends  to reinforce  our view that low inflation is very positive toeconomic  growth,  to employment, to stability, to all the good things we talk about withrespect to the economy.  Therefore,  it is crucial to keep inflation  low.  The argument that wecan wait until we see  signs of inflation before taking action fails  to take  account of howimportant  this low inflation environment  apparently has been  in enhancing the recentperformance  of the economy.  It strikes me that whatever  we do,  we need above all to makecertain  that we keep inflation  low, risk premiums  low, and  the cost of capital low.  Werecognize  that that can create unusual  problems  within balance sheets and the  like, andmembers have expressed  some concerns  regarding  those problems of late.  Nonetheless,  ifwe are talking about long-term equilibrium, high market values  are better than low marketvalues.  What we are trying to avoid is bubbles  that break, volatility, and the like, but we are3/25/97not opposed  to the  implications  of low inflation,  which include relatively low risk premiumsand fairly strong  economic activity.I conclude that what  we clearly need at  this  stage is finally to move  off the dime.  Ithink that 25 basis points is enough  for now; indeed,  I will  argue  against 50 basis points in  aminute.  It is conceivable that economic  growth  may slow,  and it  is possible to  interpret thedata we have  seen as suggesting  that backlogs,  new  orders,  and sales  are beginning to turnsluggish outside the high-tech  area.  As far as the high-tech  sector is  concerned,  we have  seena very strong acceleration  over the last two or three  years that is numerically unsustainablebecause  if that rate of growth were to continue,  the high-tech area would  soon account  for120 percent of GDP!  That clearly  is not going to happen.  I think the stock  market is tellingus  that the growth  projections implicit  in some of those earnings  forecasts  for high-techindustries are  unrealistic, and there is some  evidence that this sector is beginning  to flattenout.  One of the reasons  why I suspect that Microsoft  is not moving terribly  fast in comingout with a Windows  97  is the fact that they are getting  some  resistance  to all thesetechnological  changes.  There is  a physical incapability of putting in one  software  revisionafter the other, and this reaction  could  very well be  in the process  of occurring.I would not rule out as a significant  probability, perhaps  not a high probability,that the  current  economic  expansion is on the verge  of some slowing.  If that does  happen,  25basis points is not  going to be a major inhibiting  factor, but 50 basis points,  which  the marketis not expecting, could be very jolting indeed.I want to recall a conversation  we had when  we last decided to move up the federalfunds rate  after a long period  of no change.  That was in February  1994.  We  had a  lengthydiscussion as to whether we  would move 50 basis points or 25 basis points.  We  did 25 basis3/25/97points and the market almost fell  apart, but not because  they did not expect us to move.  Asyou all know,  I had been  out there  in the immediately preceding  weeks in effect waving a redflag  saying we were  about to do something.  We did  it and somebody  asked,  "Why didn't youtell us?"At this stage, the  market is expecting  25 basis points.  It has discounted  such amove, frankly, but it has done so in a positive  way, not a negative  way.  The  stock marketsare up this morning;  the bond market is up.  I think that if we were to move  50 basis pointstoday after a long period of doing nothing, though being vigilant if you like, we  suddenlywould shock the market into thinking that  we must feel  that we are  behind the curve.  We arenot behind the curve,  and we have  a lot of time to take various  actions  as we perceive theneed to take them.I think the odds  are better than 50/50 that the move we  are considering  will not beour last tightening move.  We are  very likely to have to move  again, though I see  a lowprobability of a very considerable  near-term  acceleration  that would raise  inflationarypressures  and require us  to move before  our May  meeting, which you will remember  is twomonths away.  I think we would have to have a telephone  conference to consider such amove partly because  the views regarding  the risks  of rising inflation  among our constituents,especially the business community, deviate  so far from where  we are that it is  very importantfor us not only to move appropriately  but also  to make certain that people  understand  why weare doing it.  You may recall  that there  was a fairly broad  consensus  at our last meeting thatwe ought to condition the markets  in the Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  to the  likelihood thatwe were finally going to move.  I think that was  a desirable thing for us to do.  I would saythat the  stage is  set for us to take  action, and I would argue  that we should do only 25 basis3/25/97points.  I must say that it definitely would be  better to do 25  basis points than to do nothing.I believe a failure to  act would be a major mistake,  given what we  see out there in theeconomy.I would prefer symmetry  at this stage if for no other reason than our having  beenasymmetric  for so long I am worried  about devaluing  the currency  so to speak.  I do not thinkthat symmetry or asymmetry  will affect our actions one way or the other, and I must tell youthat I do not feel  strongly about my preference.  If we were  to move  further before the  nextmeeting,  we  would do so with a preceding telephone  conference,  so as  a practical  matter thesymmetry or asymmetry  doesn't mean  anything in this situation.  It does, however,  establisha presumption  that we probably  would move again in  May.  The issue is basically whetherwe  want to convey that notion in advance, because  having asymmetry  and then not movingagain is  something that I think we ought not to get involved  with.  In sum, my view on thesymmetry/asymmetry  issue is more a mechanical  than a policy matter.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I would  strongly support this set  of moves--the  25  basis points  anda symmetric directive.  I think what we say about our action is terribly important, not just inthe announcement but  what we all  say about it over the next few days.  I believe the keywords should be that we want to sustain the growth of the economy and to sustain  our abilityto have tight labor markets.  There is  an enormous benefit, which we are  seeing,  in havingtight labor markets,  and I think we ought  to say that sustaining them is our  goal.  I  also wouldsupport a symmetric  directive because  I think there is significant uncertainty  about whetherwe  will want to move again in May.  We do not want to  stack the deck.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.3/25/97

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I strongly support yourrecommendation  for a 25 basis point increase  in the funds rate, and I can accept  yourrecommendation  for a symmetric directive  though  I could have  been persuaded  to go for anasymmetric  one.  I will come back to that later.  I want to focus my remarks,  though, on ananalytical  framework for supporting this kind of a move.  First, I want to consider theimplications  of the Taylor Rule  and talk about the importance of a flexible  approach tointerest rates  in response  to economic  developments.  I also want to explain  why we shouldnot leave  the task of countercyclical  policy to the bond market and  present an interpretation  oftightening in terms of what I will call the maxi/min  solution.The Taylor Rule,  as Don  Kohn noted in his presentation,  would suggest no moveat this meeting because utilization rates  are about the same as they have been and coreinflation is actually lower.  While the Taylor Rule does not provide  support for an actiontoday, it would suggest that, if the Greenbook forecast  proves  to be correct, we will want totighten later.  There is, however,  an alternative  specification  of the Taylor Rule that would, inmy view, support a tightening of policy today.  I will call  it the  forward-looking  Taylor Rule.To be  sure, the standard rule is forward-looking  to a degree  in relation to inflation  because itincludes current  utilization rates.  But in  the forward-looking Taylor Rule,  actual  values ofinflation  and utilization rates are replaced by forecasts.  There is a growing literature onforward-looking  policy reaction  functions.  An early paper was done by Steve McNees  at theFederal Reserve Bank of Boston in the mid-1980s  and updated in the early  1990s.  Over thelast year, in fact, there  has been  a flurry of additional  work along  this avenue,  including workin progress  at the Board, which finds that policymaking has tended to evolve over  the last 15years from reliance on incoming data to gradual responses to forecasts.  However, these3/25/97papers are  an exercise in description  and what we really  need is a normative analysis  toconfirm that moving  in response to forecasts,  given the accuracy  of forecasts, would producebetter results than responding  to actual  data.Would such  a forward-looking  reaction  function provide  support for moving todaywhen we did not choose to move at  earlier meetings?  In terms of thinking  about raisinginterest rates  today, we might  interpret the recent strengthening  as  a shift in the IS  curve andask whether monetary  policy  should impose a horizontal LM  curve that would resist thenatural tendency for stronger growth  to push up interest  rates.  Alternatively,  shouldmonetary  policy enforce  an upward sloping LM  curve that allows  a stabilizing response tocyclical  strength?  In fact, there  has been  a lot of discussion  or implicit commentary  aroundthe  table about the old pegging  strategy, the mistakes  of the  1960s,  and  also more  discussionof M2  than at any of the previous FOMC meetings that I have  attended.  One of theimplications  of imposing that horizontal LM curve is allowing  an acceleration  of M2  growthin response to a shift in the  IS curve.Some might argue  that because long-term interest rates already have risen  alongwith  the dollar, the economy is moving  along an upward-sloping  LM curve.  I do not believe,however,  that we should leave monetary policy to the bond market.  The question is  whetherwe  should be validating or resisting the recent move in long-term rates.  That move after allreflected  to a significant  degree  the bond markets'  expectation of a shift in monetary policy,particularly  as a result of the Chairman's recent testimony  combined with  the recent strengthin the  data.  Let's pat the bond  markets on the back and tell them that we  appreciate  theireffort but  also let them know that they  should not have  to do all the work.3/25/97Finally, let me discuss the maxi/min  solution.  Here I compare  the consequences  oftwo types of mistakes we could make today:  not tightening when  that would have beenappropriate  versus tightening when it was not needed.  In this approach, a decision  today canbe interpreted as selecting  the best of the worst possible outcomes.  First, consider  whatwould happen if we tighten when that turns out to be unnecessary,  NAIRU could turn  out tobe lower than anticipated,  productivity growth higher than projected, or demandunexpectedly weaker.  The unemployment rate  could then be higher than would have beendesirable  and inflation  lower than otherwise.  In this case, the unemployment rate would stillbe at a historically low level  and inflation would be moving toward our long-run  objective,not a really bad outcome.  Indeed, that would be  a preferred  outcome  for some on thisCommittee.On the other hand, if we failed to tighten  when it would have been  appropriate  todo so, the excess demand gap would open or widen  and inflation could increase.  We wouldthen face  the Taylor Rule's triple whammy  on the funds rate.  We would  have to raise thefunds rate  to prevent  the real  rate from declining, to counter the rise in output relative topotential,  and to combat the  increase in inflation relative to our target.  This is usually anugly affair.  It does not end well for the economy.Mr. Chairman,  because  I am guided  by a forward-looking  specification  of theTaylor Rule, because  I believe we should be flexible in adjusting  interest rates to changingeconomic  developments,  because I think we should enforce  an upward-sloping  LM curve inresponse to shifts in the IS curve,  and because  it is a maxi/min  solution, I support yourrecommendation  for tightening monetary policy.  Because  containing a threat to higherinflation is likely to require  some further increase in  short-term rates beyond the small3/25/97change contemplated  today, I could have  accepted  a call for an asymmetric  directive.  I thinkthat is particularly  true given that your comments raised the possibility, if not the likelihood,of a move between  now and the next meeting.  That  sounds like an  asymmetric  directive tome.  But I do not see that  as a very important point, and  I can  certainly  accept your scenario.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think that thebest thing to concentrate  on at the moment, or at least what I find myself concentrating  on, iswhat we do not know.  Even though  we have  had a lot of rather good albeit partialexplanations,  I think we  are not, and certainly  I am not, altogether sure  why inflation  and thecost-push causes  of inflation  have been  so benevolent.  We are tightening now largelybecause  we as  a group have decided--and  certainly I believe--that the risks of waiting furtherhave become excessive  and therefore  unacceptable.  Then  the question  arises as  to how muchwe should tighten.  I think 25  basis points does two  things.  It indicates  our concern,especially given the fact that a shift in policy direction  is involved, but it does not pretendthat we know more than we know.  I,  at least,  am not so  sure  that the benign performance  ofgrowth and inflation, which  we have  found acceptable  since  last July, is going  to end  soon.Therefore,  I think it is appropriate  that our response be  moderate  and in that sense  a 25 basispoint increase  is enough.  I believe  a 50 basis point move  would indicate a far greaterassurance  regarding the end of the  benign period--that  it is more  highly predictable  and willoccur  sooner--than I feel  intellectually  or in any other way.The asymmetric  directive--I  think I have become  almost the resident theologian onwhat asymmetry means--is  inappropriate  now.  I believe that the combination of a  movewith asymmetry would cause  us to fall into the same  trap of assuming something that we do3/25/97not know.  If, as is possible and  not absolutely a no-brainer, we decide  that we have toincrease the fed funds rate again either before the next meeting or at the next meeting, thelack of asymmetry  when we announce  it in releasing the minutes the Thursday after the Maymeeting will not be very important  to anybody.  Consequently,  I think the 25  basis pointincrease and a symmetric  directive  are most consistent with what we know  and maybe moreimportantly with what we do not know.

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I support your recommendation  on the federalfunds rate.  Though I might prefer  asymmetry,  given your comments I would also supportsymmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I can accept  your recommendation.  Onbalance,  I think the case for a larger move  is stronger than indicated by others who havespoken to this point.  But I am satisfied with  1/4 point.  It is  a way of getting back into theballgame,  so to speak, and reaffirming  our longer-term  commitment to price  stability.  I dothink, as you suggested, that this move very likely will not be our last and  that we will  haveto tighten further.  And I see a good chance that the tightening may happen  sooner rather thanlater, perhaps  before the May meeting.  I hope  we will move promptly  if we need to do so.In that context, I would prefer an asymmetric  directive  because I think the situation  evenafter a  1/4 point increase is still going to be  asymmetric.  The issue  is not a deal breaker forme, but I have  more than a marginal preference  for asymmetry.If I could add  one other hopefully preemptive point:  In this situation, I think thereis some possibility  the dollar could strengthen.  I am not predicting that, but  I think it is3/25/97possible.  If it should, I hope we will resist the temptation to engage  in any foreign  exchangemove.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I should mention that the estimated Taylor Rule,which we use as a policy reaction  function in our  forecasting model  and which  I think  ispreferable  to the original  Taylor formulation, suggests  a gradual  rise in the  funds rate totalingabout  100 basis points, with the increases  beginning in the second  quarter and continuingthrough the end of this year.  The  degree of tightening is very similar to the one assumed inthe tighter policy simulation  in the Greenbook.  According to our analysis,  a path like this forthe funds rate appears  necessary just to hold the line  at around 3 percent on core  CPIinflation.  It certainly is  time to take  an initial step in tightening policy.  While  I think thecase for a 50 basis point increase  is  stronger than you do, Mr. Chairman,  I would support a25 basis point increase to 5-1/2  percent.  I also would  strongly prefer to have  language in thedirective  that is asymmetric  toward further tightening  since I think that course  of action  islikely to be appropriate  in the future.  It seems to me that there was very little, if any,discussion around the  table that would be consistent with  a symmetric  directive.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, as we all have  said, we need to beforward-looking  in our policy, and I think a rate of inflation  as high as the forecast  we haveseen  today is clearly unacceptable.  Just looking at the Greenbook  forecast  of a core inflationrate  of 3.2 percent by  1998, that rate would increase  to 3.6 percent if we  added back the BLSmethodological  changes.  Although  this forecast has not changed  since our last meeting, I3/25/97think we  are more  confident about the forecast today than we were then because  of thepersisting  strength in the  economy and because of other changes  in the forecast,  as LarryMeyer  pointed out in his comments.  Therefore,  I clearly support your recommendation  forthe 25  basis point increase,  and I prefer  25 basis  points to 50 basis points for the reasons  thatyou explained.  I would prefer  an asymmetrical  directive,  but I do not feel strongly  enoughabout it to dissent on that issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  I fully support your recommendation  for both the25 basis points and the symmetric  directive.  I, like many others,  could support anasymmetric  directive  as  well, but I think your wisdom in this case is good  as usual.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I support a 25 basis point increase.  We  ought to explain thistightening action by indicating that we  think we will increase the  chances  of prolonging theexpansion by moving now.  We central bankers  ought to like job creation;  we ought to likegrowth; we  ought to like prosperity, and I think we ought to explain  our actions in the contextof favoring  those things.  Indeed,  if we have learned anything, it is that low  inflation ispro-growth rather than anti-growth.  With regard  to the symmetry  issue, I think the choice  ofsymmetry or asymmetry  is based on a flexible theology.  It seems to play different roles atdifferent meetings,  and I do not have strong feelings one  way or the  other.  But I think yourrationale is as good as  any, Mr. Chairman,  so I would vote for symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stem.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I am generally comfortable  with your recommendation,  Mr.Chairman.  I do not want to dwell on too many nuances, but let me just make a couple of3/25/97additional comments.  Like President Broaddus,  if I interpreted him correctly,  I guess I  amsomewhat less confident than you that we are not behind the curve.  My concern  is that thereseems to be a lot of momentum to demand  in the economy,  and that momentum couldtranslate into rising inflationary  pressures.  While I agree with your assessment that weprobably have  been underestimating  productivity  growth  for some time, I wonder howwidespread that mismeasurement  is and what the prospects  for productivity  are goingforward.  Mike Prell's report on the dichotomy between the views of the banker and theindustrialist is perhaps a little indicative.  There is no doubt that the productivity  increaseshave  been substantial in manufacturing,  but people in the financial  services  industry at leastimplicitly suggest that they have not achieved  the  same kind of gains.  I think that is one ofthe reasons they have  not quite bought into the "new  era"  story the way  others have.Having  said that, I think that when  we make policy adjustments  like this, it pays tobe cautious.  We are uncertain about the outlook; we are uncertain  about  the effectiveness  ofpolicy;  and because  of those uncertainties,  I think we ought to be cautious.  As I said, I amcomfortable  with your recommendation.

MR. GUYNN.  I, too, am comfortable with your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman.I came  to this meeting  with a preference  for an  asymmetrical  directive,  and even after thediscussion,  I still have  a slight preference for that.  But you and  others have argued verypersuasively that it is not a big deal in present  circumstances,  so I am comfortable  with asymmetrical  directive.

At 5-1/2 percent,we may not be that far out of alignment, so symmetry seems  like the right message  to me.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  We are  now entering  the  seventh year of the expansion as datedby the National Bureau.  For the most part, it has been  an extraordinary  expansion in that notonly has  inflation been contained, but more importantly it has tended to drift down  throughthis expansion period,  which is remarkable.  Last  summer when Fed watchers--Wall  Streettypes especially--were  certain that we were  not only going to raise  rates then but that a tighterpolicy was needed, I was comfortable in not supporting that view.  I felt from aforward-looking  perspective  that we would continue to get productivity  increases, downwardpressure on inflation, and a concurrent  decline in the  unemployment rate.  People'sperception  about capacity  and how much slack existed would be changing, which  allowed usthe luxury of leaving the nominal  funds rate where it was  and not incurring  any trouble.  ButI also was counting  on not having an acceleration  in the growth of nominal  final demand.3/25/97For quite a while we had been in  a period  where the  successive Greenbook  surprises  were inthe direction of lower nominal  spending growth than previously  forecast.  Not  only wasinflation  lower, but nominal  spending growth  and domestic final demand  growth were lower.Even  as recently  as the  December Greenbook--a  week  or two  away from the end of thequarter--we  were  looking at a fairly modest growth rate  of nominal  spending  of under  5percent for the fourth quarter.Of course, it did not turn  out that way.  It came in much, much stronger.  But thenin the February Greenbook  we still were looking  at the  reported  strength in  the fourth  quarteras having been a one-time  occurrence  associated  with such  things  as seasonals,  weather, andthe trade  sector.  Now we  are looking at a situation  where nominal  spending growthaccelerated  very sharply  in the final two quarters  of the  sixth year of this  expansion  and,more  important in some ways, where  the domestic  component  of final  demand accelerated  inthose two quarters.  All of that may turn out to have been  a one-time thing,  and  spendinggrowth may decelerate  significantly from these  levels.  But when we  look at virtually  everymeasure  of money and credit, the monetary base,  Ml, MZM,  and so on, not only  for thiscountry but around the world, we find  that such money growth rates have  acceleratedsharply.  That says to me that the world's  central banks  are financing  an acceleration  in finaldemand  and that monetary  policy could very quickly  come to be viewed as being behind thecurve and require  a lot of adjustment to make  sure  that money growth does  not  start sproutingout in higher inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Given the  possibility  that we would do this, Ialready have a draft of what we may want to announce.  I will read the whole draftannouncement."The  Federal Open Market Committee  decided today to tighten money marketconditions  slightly, expecting the federal  funds rate to rise about  1/4 percentage  point toaround 5-1/2 percent.This action  was taken in light of persisting  strength in demand,  which hasprogressively  increased the risk of inflationary imbalances  developing that would eventuallyundermine the long expansion.In these circumstances,  the slight firming  of monetary conditions  is viewed as aprudent step that affords greater assurance  of continuing the current  low inflationenvironment  for the rest of this year and  next and prolonging the  economic  expansion.  Theexperience  of the last several  years has reinforced  the conviction that  low inflation  isessential to realizing  the economy's  fullest growth potential.No change  was made in the Federal Reserve  discount rate, which remains at 5percent."Is that acceptable  to everybody?  I would put it out in the name of the Committeebecause  this is such an  important document.  I hope you do not mind in this context.
