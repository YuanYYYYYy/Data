CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody  like  to move  the  approvalof  the minutes  for  the March 28  meeting?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  We now turn  to  PeterFisher who will  report  on  the operations  of  both  the  foreign  Desk andthe  domestic  Desk.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  I will  first discusscurrent  conditions  in  interest  rate markets  and  then  some  of  thefactors  contributing  to  recent  exchange rate  movements  beforereviewing  foreign and  then domestic  operations.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  In  the  domestic  report,  you  indicated that  agroup  of  traders  was  "priced out  of  the  market."  What does  "pricedout  of  the market"  mean, and how do  you  know they were priced  out?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  If  you  are  taking a  short position  on  theexpectation  that  the data  will  lean  the  other way or  the market  willnot  continue  to  rally,  you begin to  lose  a  lot  of  money and you  haveto cover your  shorts.  There  are people  who  believe  that  there will  bea  rebound in  activity by  the  end of  the  year, but  it  is  too  expensivefor  them  to  try to  express  that  position  in  the market.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Do you  take  a survey or--

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  We  talk  to people,  and  there  are  some  well  knownlosses  that  are  now reported.  We  certainly  talk to  the dealers  aboutmajor positions  that  go  against  them.  So, yes,  there  are  informalsurveys  and some  more  formal  surveys.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think the  Governor  is  asking  thequestion,  "What in the  world does  it  mean  to  say you  are  priced out  ofthe  market?"

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  That's  right.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  You  lose  a  lot  of  money!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I think,  as  Don said, you  lose  a  lot  of  money.There  were people  who were priced out  of  the  market  in December.  Theythought  that  the  fed  funds  rate might  not be  raised  200  basis points5/23/95in  1995  and  that  the yield curve had moved well beyond  where  it  wouldgo.  But  they chose  not  to  express  that  view  in  the  market  in

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor,  what  he  is  saying  is  aeuphemism  for  indicating  that  they were wrong and  that  the  price  theyare  looking at  now  is  too high to  buy.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Did  I get  it  right,  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Sure.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  other questions?  PresidentForrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Peter,  what effect,  if  any, would you  expectthe  threatened  trade  sanctions  with Japan  to  have  on  the  foreignexchange markets?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There were various  stages  in their  announcementprocess.  One  of  the  earlier, more  definitive, announcements  actuallyhad  a positive  effect  on  dollar/yen--modestly positive.  I think  Ihave  described my views  to  the  Committee  before  on  this.  When  theno  action  is  anticipated--just  a  lot  of  angry words--that  tends  to  benegative  for  the  exchange  markets  because  they don't perceive  thatanything concrete will  be  done.  But  on  the  few occasions  when  ourtrade  representative has  announced concrete  trade  policy steps,whether sanctions  or  invocations  of  statutory authority,  the  exchangethat  at  least  the  sign  is  right  for  the  impact  on  our  short-run  tradeposition.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Peter, you  talked about  a  coupon purchaseoperation  in  the  last  maintenance period and  about the  possibility oftwo  such operations  in  the  intermeeting period coming up.  This  raisesa question  I have  wondered  about  for  a  long time,  which  is  how youI was  just  looking at  the  table  in  your report which  shows  that  about50  percent  of  our portfolio  is  now invested  in Treasury bills, withvarious percentages  in  other maturities.  It  is  not  obvious  what  thecriteria are  nor what  the  long-run goal  is--if  there  is  a  goal  for  thematurity  structure--nor how individual  purchases  and  runoffs  ofsecurities  contribute  to  or  detract  from  that  goal.  What  do  you haveto  say about  that?  Do you  feel  that you  know what  the  criteria  are?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No,  I don't,  and  I would like  to  look into  andclarify some  of  the  criteria  that  we use  to  approach this  task.  Thepresumption for  several  years  has been  that  we  are  really replicatingthe portfolio  as  it  exists.  So,  there  is  simply  an effort  to maintainroughly the  current maturity mix.  That  is  the  policy that  I inheritedand  it  can be  seen  in  effect  in  the  new tables  that we provide  at  theback of  our  report.  It  is  a policy that  I have  been  trying tounderstand better and  to  think through  some  of  its  implications.  It5/23/95is  something  that  we have  begun  to work  on.  We  contemplate having  afew  staff people  devote  a fair  amount  of  time  over coming  months  tothinking  through the  criteria that  we  use  as  we  approach each auction.The  tradition has  been  to  assume  that  we  wanted a relatively highcomponent  of  bills  to  permit  the portfolio  to  run off  rather easilywithout  the need  to  sell  a lot  of  securities  into  the market  anddisturb  the  structure of  the yield  curve,  if  such an  occasion were  toarise.  So,  that  is  the  nature  of  the  received wisdom  and how I  intendto  proceed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  As  a  follow up, would  that  review also  includethe  absolute size  of passes  and  their  impact  on  the composition  of  thepermanent portfolio?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.  The presumption  as  to  the  size  of  eachpass  is  sort  of  built  into  the assumptions  about  how we  operate.  Wehave  to  look at  the  two  together.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  We  will  be  looking  at  that.  There  are argumentsfor  smaller  passes  with more frequent  operations;  there  are  argumentsfor  larger ones.  I have  had  some very  interesting discussions  withother central  bankers  in my position  about the nature  of  a centralbank portfolio and how  to  think about  it.  There  is  not muchdivergence  in  practices, but  there  is  a wide range of  views  about  howto  think about  this.  One central  banker  feels  very strongly that  acentral  bank's  portfolio  should never  contain on-the-run  securities.A central  bank,  after all,  makes  its  own liquidity.  Why does  thecentral  bank need  to  hold on-the-run  issues?  The  central  bank shouldexclusively be buying  everything that  is  off  the  run.  But  inpractice,  of  course,  that  would  involve  the  Herculean effort  of beingthe  vacuum cleaner  of  the  securities  market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Especially  if  you have  to  sell.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And to  whom.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  And  to who.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And to  whom.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'm sorry Peter,  I just  thought  I wouldpick on  you  this morning.  I took  a pill  that  says,  "Pick on Peter."

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That's  fine.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  He  can  take  it.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  So,  there  is  a wide  range of  views.  A number  ofcentral banks  that  apply very sophisticated approaches  to  theirforeign  currency portfolios--really as  profit  centers--have  been5/23/95-4-backfitting  some  of  that  financial  technology  into  thinking abouttheir domestic  portfolios.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can  I suggest  that  we  consider  thisissue periodically?  The  issue  raised by Governor Blinder  is  somethingthat  is  very important  for us  to  look at.  The way you phrased youranswer,  Peter,  I think  underscores  that.  To maintain  the  status  quoreally makes  no  sense whatever.  The  crucial  question  is:  Whatliquidity needs do we  have  and what  are  the  implications?  I hope  thatyou  and Don can get  together  and come  up with  a report  that  gives  theCommittee  some  insight  into what  the  principles  should be.Let  me  just  state my own view of  what I would like  to  see  inthat  report:  What would have been  the consequences,  for  example,  if  afew of  the major money center banks  had  gone  belly-up in  1990,  whichwas  not an  altogether bizarre possibility,  and of  the possiblediscount window lending  that  could  have  required huge  liquidationsfrom  our  portfolio?  Secondly,  there  is  the  interesting  question  ofwhether  in  fact  we  could get both  that  scenario  and  the  need for  amajor accumulation of  foreign  currencies.  My suspicion  is  that  thetwo  contingencies  probably would involve  disparate  economic  events  andit  is  very unlikely  that  they would come  together.  But we  could  facethe  need to  acquire  very  large amounts  of  foreign  currencies  over  ashort period  of  time.Finally,  I think it  would be  useful  to  get  a notion of  theeffect of  changing the maturity  composition of  our portfolio  on  theportfolio  held by  the public.  That  ultimately affects  the  sensitivityof  interest payments  in  the  budget,  taking  into  account  FederalReserve  earnings,  to  changes  in  market  interest  rates.  Clearly, wehave  been very much  inclined over  the  years  to  try  to  stay away  from  aposition where  the  short-term  interest  rate  actions  of  the  FederalReserve  could have pronounced  federal  budget  effects.  To  the  extentthat  we  lengthen  the  average maturity  of  our portfolio  and  theTreasury does  not  offset what we  are doing,  that  creates  a portfoliowith an  increasingly shorter  average  maturity in  the  hands  of  thepublic.  Therefore,  the  consolidated interest  costs  including  FederalReserve  earnings  tend  to  be more  sensitive  to  changes  in  interestrates--obviously in  the  direction  of  higher  rates  being associatedwith higher  federal  outlays.  I don't  know how sensitive  thatrelationship  is,  but  I do  think  that  the  argument  should be  to  get  asmuch  liquidity as  we  mught  conceivably need  in  the  context  of whateverwe  view as  a potential  amount of  resources  that  might be drained  fromour  balance  sheet  and  then multiply it  by  some number  like  they do  atthe  BIS--I  think  it  is  three.  [Laughter] I don't know whether  threeis  the magic  number, but  there  should be  some criteria.I think Governor Blinder  raises  an  important  issue.  We  havethis  huge  portfolio,  and we  don't  really have a  set  of  principles  thatthis  Committee  determines  and  I think we  should.  So,  I wouldappreciate it  if,  sooner  rather  than  later,  you  could come  up with aset  of  principles  that  we  can  then  debate  at  some meeting.  Anyfurther  comments  on  this?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I wonder  if  Peter would  comment  on whether he  isholding  the  fed  funds  rate  up  to  6 percent  or  down to  6 percent.5/23/95

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  By normally  leaving the  market  a  little short,we  continue  to  push  the  rate  in  that  direction.  The rate  expectationscan be  seen  in  the  fed  funds  futures  contracts.  Both my report  andDon's  report  indicate  that  the market  is  looking  for  the  funds  rate  tobe  edging  down, or  skewed  slightly  in  that  direction, over  comingmonths.  We  do not  feel  a great  deal  of  pressure  in  the  reserve marketitself.  I wouldn't relate  this  to  the  substance behind your question,but  there have  been some  occasions  where demand for  excess  reservesseemed  a little  on  the  soft  side  in  the  last  few weeks.  I think  thatis  more of  an anomaly, but  it  is  something  that  I am  intrigued with.There was one  period in which  the demand  for  excess  reserves wasreally extraordinarily soft;  we  still have  not gotten  our  hands  on  thereason  for  that  excess  level  below  $1/2  billion.  I don't see  that  asa profound  change but more  as  a  fluctuation  in  the  reserve  marketitself.  But  the market's  forecast  certainly  is  leaning  in  that  easingdirection.  I don't  think we have  quite  felt  that  in our  reservemanagement yet.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further  questions?  If  not, we  need  totake three  votes.  The  first  is  to  ratify  the  foreign  currencytransactions  since  the  last meeting.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Second, we will needto  ratify the  domestic  operations during  the  intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Finally,  Peter hasrequested an  increase  in  the  intermeeting  leeway  from  $8 to  $10billion.  May  I have a motion on  that?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval  of  the  $10  billionlimit.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Now  let's  go  on  toMike  Prell.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Mike?  Mike,  I meant  tolook up  something before we  came  in.  I don't  know if  you have  thedata with you, but what  is  the  gap between new orders  of  durable  goodsand shipments  in  the  last  report?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It  will  take  me  a minute  or  so  to  find that.  Ithink we  are still  seeing  rising backlogs.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  My recollection  is  that we  have  a  spreadof  several percentage  points.  The  reason I raise  the  question is  to5/23/95gauge how much of  a drop in new  orders  can occur  in  the  near  termwithout  unfilled orders  also  turning  down.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I can't  give you  that  answer  immediately.  I'msorry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mike,  the  forecast  that  you gave  has  the  coreCPI  running at  roughly 3 percent  throughout  the  last  half  of  1995  andall  of  1996,  and you have built  in,  of  course,  the  assumption of  aflat  fed  funds  rate  at  6 percent.  Just  looking at  those  two numberswould mean that  the  real  fed funds  rate would be  roughly  3 percentduring this  period.  We  have  often  talked  about  the  concept  of  aneutral monetary policy.  I am wondering how you would relate  thatreal  fed funds  rate  to  the  idea  of  a neutral  monetary policy--whetheryou  see  this  as  a neutral monetary policy.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I don't  have  in mind a particular  number  thatgoes  with neutrality  in  the  sense  that  over  time  one would  expect  theeconomy  to  grow  at  potential--or  to  sit  at potential  output.  We haveinterpreted monetary policy per  se  as  probably modestly restrictive  atthis  point.  That  is,  the  real  rate  of  interest  is  perhaps  somewhatabove  the natural  rate.  But,  in  the  total  financial picture,  we alsorecognize  that  credit  availability if  anything has been  improving;  theterms  and  standards  of  bank  loans  have been moving  in  an  easingdirection;  and we  also have had  an  impulse  through the  exchangethat  is  tending  to  be  stimulative  over  this  period.  So,  on balance,we don't have  a picture of  very marked financial  impetus  or restraint.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  But  is  there  a  zone  or number  that  you  think  ofas  a neutral  monetary  policy?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We would anticipate, particularly  in  anenvironment of  ongoing  fiscal  restraint,  that  the  equilibrium as  welook  ahead to  1996,  1997,  1998  would be  one  in  which the  real  short-term interest  rate would move closer  to  its  historical  average;  thatrate would be  on  the  order of  2 percent  or maybe  a bit  less.  Thiswould  suggest  that  the  rate probably  is  higher  now than would beexpected over  the  longer  term.  So,  we have  some  restraint  there.  Donpoints  out  to  me  that  we have had  a very big  run-up  in  the  stockMr.  Chairman,  in answer  to your  question about  nondefensecapital  goods,  orders were  about  4-1/2  percent  above  shipments.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In March?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In March.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Ted, your  forecast  for  Japan  indicates a  fairlyrespectable pickup  in  1995  and  1996,  and  I saw that  the  consensus  ofabout  15  international  forecasters  is  very close  to  your  forecast.  Iwas wondering how important  fiscal  stimulus was  in  that  forecast.  Wehave  had  instances  in  the  last  couple  of  years  where the  degree  of5/23/95fiscal  stimulus  in Japan has  been a disappointment.  I wondered  if  youwould comment  in general  about  that  projected pickup.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Just  one  technical point:  The pickup  as  far  asthis  year  is  concerned  is  quite modest.  I think  the  fundamentalpickup  may be seen by  focusing  on the  fourth quarter-over-fourthquarter number.  Because  there  was  a big negative  number last  year,the  pickup  looks  a little better  as  a percent  than we  would think,though we  are  looking  for  an annual  rate  of  growth  in  the  2 to  2-1/2percent range  for  the  balance of  this year.  But,  as  Mike  mentioned,we  have tended  to mark things down  over  the  last  several  forecasts.  Ithink we  would have  marked things  down even  more  in  the  absence  ofthis  fiscal package, which came  in  a bit  on  the high  side  of  people'sexpectations.  I find  it  extremely difficult  to  judge  Japanese  fiscalpolicy because  we  don't have  a very good baseline,  if  I may put  itthat  way.  They have  two  or  three  supplemental budgets  a year.  Thefundamental budget  may be  good  from  the  standpoint  of  fiscalrectitude.  It  may be  a great way of  running  things because  they canalways  drop back  to  a more restrictive  policy  in  the  absence  ofspecial  supplemental  budgets.  On  the other  hand, in  terms  of  judgingthe  ongoing  thrust of  policy in  the  context  of  unusually  large  outputgaps  and, as  Peter mentioned,  the  threat of  deflation,  that probablyis  not  the  right  assumption to  make.  I believe  the  Japanese  situationclearly involves  some  downside  risk on balance.  It  is  not anunreasonable forecast,  but  it  probably has  an  uncertainty band aroundit  that  is  a bit wider  than  the  forecasts  for  the  other  industrialcountries.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Does  your  forecast  have  an  explicit  assumptionabout  trade  relations  with the  United States?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We  have essentially  ignored the  trade  relationsquestion  in  the  forecast.  So,  I guess  implicitly we  are  assuming thatsome  time between  now and  the  end of  June  this  particular matter  willbe  settled.  There  are  then  two  questions.  One would be  what  happensif  Congress  does  go  through with  the  sanctions.  The  trade  and  theprice  implications  of  that  are  likely to  be pretty secondary;  we  aretalking about  $6 billion worth  of  consumer  demand.  I guess  thesimplest  calculation would imply  a shift  to  that  much more nominalspending, but  that  is  only  0.1  percent  of  total  consumer  spending oversome  period.  We  have  to  worry about  secondary  effects, but we  alsohave  to  worry about  other  adjustments  if  we  assume  a  full pass-through.  So,  it  is  not a big number.  Also,  the  overall  tradeimplications  are  not  likely  to  be  very large  because most  of  thepresumed  shift  in  demand  for  luxury cars will  go  to  Germany and othercountries.  So,  in  terms  of  the  aggregate  effect  on  trade, not muchwould be  different.  That's  the  easy part  of  the  story.  The  moredifficult part would be  to  gauge what  would happen  if  we  got  involvedin  a so-called  trade war.  That  is  a phrase we  throw around, but  Idon't  think we  really know what  it  means,  or  I don't know what  I meanwhen I  say it.  Probably  the  most  important  aspect  of  that  would bethe  impact  on  financial markets  on  the  one  hand and  some  broadperception  of  where economies were  going, which  I think  is  likely  tobe negative.  It  is  hard to  imagine  that  a  trade  war would not be  anegative  factor on  the whole,  but how bad  it  would be  is  difficult  tojudge.  So,  in  that  context,  we  have  assumed  it  is  not  going  tohappen!5/23/95

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Mike,  my questions  are  really  along  the  samelines  as  those  that  Mike Moskow asked you  earlier.  Your response  tohim  frankly  is  not  the  response  I would have  expected  from my readingof  the  Greenbook.  A year  ago  at  this  meeting we were  talking  aboutthis  issue  of  neutrality.  There was  a  fair  amount  of  discussion  thenand at  the  next  couple  of meetings  about what  it  means  to  be at  aneutral  level  in  some  sense  on nominal  short-term  interest  rates andwhere neutral  is.  So,  when  I read this  Greenbook,  I was  led tobelieve  that  a neutral  nominal  rate  for  fed  funds  was  6 percent  orslightly below 6 percent  but  that  it  could be  a little  higher.  Therewas  a phrase  in  the Greenbook about  the  core  rate  of  inflation movingup  through  1995  and  1996  because  that was  consistent  with an  excess  ofaggregate demand  over potential  supply.  There was  also  a  statement  tothe  effect  that  the  recent bond market rally had pushed  long-terminterest rates  below a sustainable  level  and  that  from  this  point  youthought  rates would go up.  As  I read the  two  alternatives  of  ahigher/lower  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the year,  the languageused to  describe  each  of  those  also  left  me  feeling  that  6 percent wasabout  neutral  or maybe  a  little below neutral.  So,  your response  thatneutral  was  below 6 percent  was not  what  I would have  guessed.  Tocome  at  it  from a slightly different  perspective,  let us  assume  thatthe  rate  got  stuck at  6 percent--that we  just pegged the  rate  at  thatlevel.  To  help condition us  a  little  to  what we might  expect  in  themidyear  review when we  come back  in July, would you describe  what youwould expect  to  be  the most  likely set  of  numbers  in terms  of  realoutput  growth,  the unemployment  rate,  and the  inflation rate  over  thenext  five  years  that  might  be  associated with a  fed  funds  rate  stuckat  6 percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I don't know  that  the  concept  of  neutrality wasever particularly well  defined, and  I think  the kind of  economicoutcome  that  would ensue  from a given  short-term real  rate  of  interestis  going to  vary considerably over  time,  depending on  fiscal policyand other  impulses.  So,  I have problems putting myself  in  thatparticular  context.  But  to  respond directly  to your  question  aboutthe  longer-term outlook,  we have  shown in previous  longer-termscenarios  in  the Bluebook  and  elsewhere  a declining path for  the  realfunds  rate  over  time because,  looking at  history, we  felt  that  thiswas  a relatively high  real  short-term  interest  rate  and one  that  wouldnot  be  consistent with  stability in  the  economy.  It  would be  exertingsome  ongoing  contractionary force  and  overshooting what  would berequired to  stabilize  the  inflation  level ultimately.  So,  if  we  redothis  projection, we would anticipate,  particularly  in a context  ofongoing  fiscal  restraint,  let  alone any balanced budget  program thatis  credible,  that  over  the next  several  years  there would be  a declinein  the  real  short-term  rate  of  interest  as  we moved either  toward  acondition  of  stability at  potential GDP  or  even maintained some minorgap  so  as  to  bring  the  inflation  rate  down  gradually.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  strikes  me  that  the  concept  probablydoes not  have  useful  meaning unless we  stipulate  that  we  are  in  anenvironment  in which  the  budget  is  balanced, prices  are  stable,  andthe  exchange  rate  is  stable.  The  latter,  of  course,  is  a  function  ofwhat  other nations  are  doing as  well.  To  have  a  concept  of  neutralitywhen  any of  those  three  is  moving,  I think  is  quite  ambiguous.  Butthe  presumption of  a  stable  economy, maximum sustainable  growth at5/23/95stable  prices,  and stable  exchange rates  does  raise a question  as  towhat real  interest rate  structure  is  consistent  with that.  Once  wemove  away  from that  framework, then  I think we  are  dealing with anindeterminate  concept.  Is  there  any way, Mike,  in which  you candefine neutrality apart  from making certain rigid prespecifications?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't  think so.  As  I said, I think  that  anumber  of  environmental  factors  would alter the  implications  of agiven real  interest rate  level.  Thus,  I don't  think there  is  a numberfor  all  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The question would be--I'm sorry.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I was  just going  to  say, building on what yousaid, Mr. Chairman,  that  in  the  long-run  scenario  in  the  lastBluebook, as  Mike pointed out,  the real  funds  rate  was  coming down tostabilize not prices  but  the  inflation  rate.  One  of  the  factorsmaking rate  declines  necessary was  that  the  impulse  from  the  declinein the  exchange rate was  wearing off  over  time.  So  you are absolutelycorrect.  I  think one has  to  define neutrality  relative  to  what  oneexpects  to  happen  to  exchange rates  as well.

MS. MINEHAN.  Absent  supply  shocks,  Mike,  and absent  a realcontractionary effect  from  fiscal policy, I would  like  to  talk  alittle  about  your inflation  forecast  and the  idea  that  you believe  therisks are  fairly evenly balanced around  the  forecast--at  least  that  ismy understanding of  what you  said.  In particular,  I was  drawn  to  thefact  that  the  ECI  is  on  a  slight upward  trend relative  to  themoderation of  the  core CPI  and  that  the  forecast  stays  at  the  low endof  most people's  assessment  of  the NAIRU range.  Where  do  you  see  thisin  1996?  Do  you still  see  the  risks  as  pretty well  balanced  aroundthis  inflation forecast  by the  end  of  1996?  I know that  is  lookingfurther  out  and we  could perhaps be  reaching some  cyclical downturn  orwhatever  that  would have  other effects  on  inflation.  I would  like  anassessment  of  what you  think the  risks are  in  1996.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Two comments  may be useful  in responding  to  that.One  is  that  you characterized  the  range of  possible NAIRU levels  asbeing one  that  was  sort  of  biased  to  the up  side  of  where  our  forecasthas been  recently.  As we  are  interpreting it,  I think we would saythat might be  a  little  too pessimistic.  Perhaps  one  of  the  risks  isthat  the very good news  we  saw on  the  ECI  through  the  first  quarter  ofthe year  is  an  indication  that  the  NAIRU was  lower  than  is  built  intoour  forecast.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Basically,  our forecast  is  one  in which theeconomy is  operating,  at  worst,  just  a shade  below the  full  employmentlevel,  or  the NAIRU, as we move  through  1996.  In  that  kind ofenvironment, one would not  anticipate a great  deal  of  pressure  towardhigher  inflation.  So,  given  the  recent  experience  and  the  factorsthat  suggest what  growth rate  may be  sustainable  in  this  economywithout  a buildup of  inflationary pressures,  I think  there  is  areasonable balance  of  risks as  we  look  out  through  next  year.  Now, weare  in a period  in which  there  are  some  vulnerabilities.  The  economy5/23/95-10-is  still  operating  at  a quite high  level.  It  is  being  hit by a  shockthrough  the  exchange rate  channel.  As  I noted, that  shock  is  not  asgreat  perhaps  as  one  would  surmise  looking at  the  yen alone,  but wethink  there  is  an  impulse  there  that  is  going  to  tend to  bring higherimport prices  and provide  an umbrella  for  domestic  producers  of  autosand  other goods.  We quite possibly  still  have  in  front  of  us  asignificant pass-through of materials  cost  increases.  We  can alreadysee  that  showing up  in  some  industries.  It  is  clearest  in industrieslike  paper, but  there  are  hints  elsewhere.  It  is  conceivable  thatthis  hump  that  we  are  looking  at  in our  forecast  could be  greater andcould  stretch  out more  if  it  generates  some broader  inflationaryexpectations  than  seem  to be  present now or  than we have  anticipatedin  the  forecast.  So,  I think  that  certainly does pose  some  short-runupside  risk at  a minimum.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I have  a question  that  is  related  to  a  coupleyou have  already  fielded about  looking  out  over  a little  longer  timehorizon.  But mine may be a bit more  specific  and pointed.  As  I  lookat  the  last  four  quarters of  this  forecast,  it  gives  off  the  aura  of  asteady  state  in  all  aspects  except  one.  Real  GDP  is  growing at  a  rateof  about 2.4  percent;  nominal  GDP  is  growing at  a rate  of  about  4.8percent;  the profits  share  is  constant;  the  savings  share  is  constant;the  unemployment  rate  is  constant;  the  funds  rate,  real  and  nominal,is  constant;  and  inflation  is  constant.  The  one  exception  to  that  iscapacity utilization, which keeps  going down;  and  that  raises  a coupleof  questions.  Where  is  it  going?  What  do you  think  is  the  naturalrate  of  capacity utilization?  What  is  it  that breaks  what  I think  ofas  not  quite an  ironclad but  a reasonable  3:1  ratio  between  changes  inunemployment and  changes  in capacity  utilization?  In the  last  fourquarters  of  the  forecast,  the change  in  the  unemployment rate  is  zerobut  the  capacity utilization  rate  goes  down by 1.1  percentage  points.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think that  relationship has  varied considerablyover  decent  spans  of  time  historically.  So,  they have not  moved  inprecise  lockstep.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Pretty  close,  though.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We  are  certainly mindful  of  there  being arelationship over  time.  By  the  end of  the period, we are  moving intothe vicinity, if  not below, what  one might  judge  to  be a natural  rateof  capacity  utilization  in manufacturing.  This  reflects  in part  theslower  growth of  goods  output  in  the  economy, but  it  also reflects  thefact  that  we  have  built  into  this  forecast  very sizable  increases  inmanufacturing capacity,  largely  in response  to  what  has been  a verylarge  increase  in  investment  in manufacturing to  date  and what  seemslikely  to  be  strong  investment  going  forward.  So,  that  is  asignificant  ingredient  in  the  diminution of  capacity utilization  inmanufacturing.  It  is  one  of  the  factors  that provides  considerablehope  that we  are  going to  see  a damping  of  inflationary pressures anda flattening  out  of  materials prices--that  such prices will  not be  aconcern when we get  to  the  latter part  of  this  year  and  certainly aswe move  through  1996.5/23/95-11-

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  So,  if  I can  interpret your answer:  If  thedemand  for  goods  and  services  is  growing  at  a  fairly  steady pace andthe  capacity in  manufacturing  to produce  goods  is  growing  faster,  thenyou would get  ever  decreasing capacity utilization in  manufacturing.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes.  Obviously,  as we move out  into  1996  andcapacity utilization drops,  corporate profits  will  not be  growing theway they have been, cash flow won't be  as  favorable, and all  of  thesefactors will  work  to  damp  further  increments  to  growth of  the  capitalstock  in manufacturing.  We  are  not going  to have  an ongoing  declinein  capacity utilization forever, but  this  is  our short-run  forecast.A  lot  of  this  is  given by the  natural  lags  in  the process  of  adding tocapacity so  that  we  think there  is  a good deal  of  momentum  in thisprocess  going  out  several  quarters.

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  Just  econometrically, Governor Blinder,  therelationship between the unemployment  rate  and  capacity utilizationthat  we have  in this  forecast  is  well  within  the historical  range thatwe have  had in  the past 20  or  30  years.  Indeed,  capacity utilizationis  on  the  low side  relative  to  the  unemployment rate.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Is  capacity utilization converging  to  81percent?  That's what  I'm driving  at.  Where  is  it  going?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I'm not  sure.  I have  a concept  of  a convergenceprocess  here,  but over  time  the  average  and what we  estimate  as  beinga natural  rate  in  terms  of  price behavior  is  at  82  percent  or maybe abit  less.  One would anticipate  that  if  we  stretch  this  out,  therewould be  some processes  that  would probably move us  in  that  direction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further  questions  for Mike?  If  not,who would like  to  start  our round table?  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Current  economic  conditions  and near-termprospects  in  our District  remain mixed, as  they have  been for  the  lastcouple  of months.  Most  of  our business  contacts  confirm an  ongoingmoderation  in  economic  activity.  In  our region as  elsewhere  thesoftening  in  activity  is  most pronounced  in consumer  spending  and  inhousing activity.  For example,  with respect  to  housing  in  theRaleigh-Durham area, multiple  listings have been running  about 25percent below their  rate  at  this  time  last  year  and prices  ofresidential  lots  have  fallen a good bit  recently.  This  is  a reallystriking  change  in  a local  area  that  has been booming for  the  lastcouple  of  years.  At  the  same  time,  we are  seeing  continuing growthand  strength  in  at  least  some  sectors  and  industries.  In particular,producers  of  chemical  and paper  products  tell  us  that  things  are  stillgoing  reasonably well,  and  they are  optimistic about  prospects  for  theremainder  of  the year--especially,  interestingly  enough,  for  exports.Also,  tourism, which is  an  increasingly  important  industry  in  our partof  the  country,  is  stronger  now  than  it  was  at  this  time  last  year.So,  again,  activity  in our District  is  mixed.  I usually  try  to  avoidusing the word  "mixed" in describing  the  economy  since  it  is  so vague,but  I think that's  essentially what  it  is  in our  region right  now.Turning to  the national  economy,  the  Greenbook  forecast  isbroadly in  line with  other  forecasts  that  I have  seen  and  it  iscertainly plausible.  But  it  is  calling  for  an almost perfect  landing,5/23/95-12-a super  soft  landing,  so  one  naturally has  to  wonder what might  gowrong.  I see  two  distinct  and  somewhat  sequential  risks,  if  I can usethat phrase,  for  the period  ahead.  First,  it  seems  to  me that  thereis  a clear, near-term downside  risk.  The Greenbook,  as  everyoneknows,  is  projecting  a sharp  reduction  in GDP  growth  in  the  second  andthird quarters  as  producers  work  inventories down.  The  risk,  ofcourse,  is  that  the  slow growth  in  jobs  and  incomes  that  presumablywill  accompany this  inventory  correction may  frighten  consumers  andpossibly precipitate  a  further  reduction  in  spending.  In  turn,  thatcould induce producers  to cut  output  further.  So,  we  could  get  a kindof  snowballing effect  such as  we  have had  in  the past,  often  in partbecause of  the  Fed's  reluctance  to  allow  interest  rates  to  declinepromptly enough when  these kinds  of  conditions have  arisen.Historically,  that  has  tended  in at  least  some  circumstances  to  shortcircuit  the natural  stabilizing properties  of  the price  system.In any case,  we  all know this  kind of  cumulative downturn  hashappened before  and  conceivably  it  could happen  this  time and  turn theinventory correction  into  something worse.  Clearly, we need to  besensitive to  that  risk.  If,  however, we get  through  the  next coupleof  quarters  okay,  including this  quarter,  and  the  expansion continuesas  the  Greenbook projects--and  frankly I  think that  is  the more  likelyoutcome--then  as  we  move  into  the  final  quarter of  this  year and  into1996,  we  will  face  a quite different  set  of  risks.  I think mostpeople  agree  that  the  level  of  real  GDP  currently is  above  its  longer-term potential  level.  That might  be  a factor  in  the  recentacceleration in  the  core  inflation rate and  in the  continuing  sharpincreases  in  the prices  of  many key  industrial materials.  TheGreenbook is  projecting, if  I have  calculated  it  right,  that  real  GDPgrowth will  average  about  2-1/4 percent  from now  through  the  end ofthe  projection horizon.  If  that  happens,  actual  real  GDP will movedown closer  to  its  potential  path.  As  I see  it,  the  risk is  that  ifthe  average  growth of  GDP turns  out  to  be higher  than  this  projection,even moderately  higher--say, because  the  inventory  correction  ismilder  or  aggregate demand  is  somewhat  stronger  than we  expect--actualGDP will  approach  its potential  path more  slowly and  remain above  itlonger.  In that  event we could see  some  considerable buildup  ininflationary momentum.  Once  that  happens,  it  could be  very difficultto  break.  In my view,  the  latter  scenario  is  still  a very realpossibility and  it  is  important  for  us not  to  let  the  currentmoderation  in activity and all  the  talk  in the  press  and  elsewhereabout  soft  landings make us  forget  that  risk.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Forrestal.

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  Economic  activityin the  Southeast  has been  slowing recently  to a more  sustainable  rateof  growth.  Notwithstanding  that  slower  growth,  job expansion  in  theDistrict continues  to  outpace  that  for  the  nation as  a whole,  althoughby a somewhat  smaller margin than  earlier,  and the  unemployment  rateremains  below  that  in  the rest  of  the  country.  Looking at  some  of  thesectors  of  the  economy, retailers  are reporting  increasing  inventoriesand  slowing  sales  for  both April  and early May.  Auto purchases  inparticular were weaker  than  a year  ago,  but  they seem  to bestabilizing now rather  than  continuing  to  decline.  Tourism isstarting  to  rebound with  the  return  of  European  visitors  to  Floridaand business  travel  has  continued  strong  throughout  the  region.5/23/95-13-The  reports  we are  getting  on manufacturing are mixed.Production and shipments  slowed  in  April,  but new orders  andproduction  are expected  to  rise.  As  Al  Broaddus  just reported, paperproducts  and chemicals  remain  quite  strong.  In  particular,  exports  ofchemicals  are  responding  rather  strongly  to  the dollar's weaknessagainst  the  deutschemark, and we  are  now  seeing  South Americancustomers ordering  from U.S. plants  as  opposed to  their Germancompetitors.  Building-related materials  industries  have weakened withthe national  slowdown  in  single-family housing, and  residentialactivity continues  to  slow  in  our  region.  Home  sales  have  fallenbelow last  year's  levels,  but realtors  are  encouraged by the  recentcontinue  to  experience rising occupancy  and rental  rates  along withaccelerating  construction.  Nonresidential real  estate  is  pretty muchin  the  same  situation.  Loan demand  is  steady in  the  region, withcommercial  demand stronger  than consumer  demand, and banks  continue tocompete pretty aggressively for  business  loans.  Wage  increases  remainstable  in most  areas  of  the  District,  and  the  extreme  shortages ofunskilled workers  that  I was reporting, particularly  in Tennessee, arenow beginning to  abate.  Skilled  construction workers  and contractorsremain  in very short  supply generally  around the  District  butparticularly  in  the Atlanta area.  Finally, manufacturers arereporting  fewer price  hikes  for both materials  and  finished products.With respect  to  the national  outlook,  our  forecast has  apattern similar  to  the  one presented  in  the  Greenbook, but we havereal  growth  somewhat  higher over  the  forecast horizon.  In  line  withthat  higher growth, unemployment moves  a  little  lower  by the  end  of1996  and  inflation ends  up  a little higher--rising  to  3-1/2  percent.I think both  of  these  forecasts,  the  Greenbook and our  staff  forecast,are  within  the  range of  reasonable  outcomes.  And while  growth  isprobably  going  to  remain  sluggish, as  we hope  it will  in  the  immediatefuture,  there  is  a possibility of  an  acceleration later  in  the year.With  respect  to  inflation,  our view continues  to  be  that  the rise  thatwe  are  seeing  is  largely a cyclical  phenomenon  as  opposed to  thecontinuation of  a trend.  I continue  to  be persuaded  that  since  wehave  not  accommodated inflationary impulses  in  recent years,  there  isno  reason  for  sustained deterioration  in prices  to  emerge past  1996.Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman, on balance  economic  activity inthe  Seventh District  in  the  last  two months  seems  to  have  continuedthe  slowing pace of  growth  in the  first quarter--led,  of  course,  bydevelopments  in  the  automobile  sector.  Confidentially, we have  theChicago  Purchasing Managers'  Index  for May, which  I caution will  notbe  public until  next Wednesday, May  31.  It  indicates  a resumption  inthe  slowing  of  the  expansion which had been  interrupted  briefly by aslight uptick  in  April.In  the  last  few days,  our  contacts  in  the  automobile  industryreported new cutbacks  in  production  schedules,  including  three  moreplants  that  will  be  down  this  week and additional  cuts  to  overtime  andline  speed at  a handful  of  other  facilities.  I note  that  forautomakers these  are very  expensive  actions  to  take  at  this  timebecause  the materials  and supplies  for  the  1995  models  have alreadybeen purchased under  contract.  One  of  the  Big Three  firms  indicated5/23/95-14-to me  that  they expected a  slower  start-up  of  the  1996  models  ininventories  of  the  1995  models.  Auto  and light  truck sales  appear  tobe  coming  in  at  about  the  14-1/2  million units  level  so  far  in May,which is  approximately 3/4  million units  above the  April pace  butstill  well  below the  expectations earlier  this  year.Housing activity  in  the region  has been  trending  down  for  thelast  few  quarters,  but District  realtors  report  some  improvement  inexisting home  sales  in  the past  two months.  Midwest  home buildersgenerally continue  to  report  a relatively higher  level  of  activity  inour District  than  in the  rest  of  the  country.A  long  delayed spring  in  the Midwest has  damped consumerspending growth, but  retailers' optimism  seems  to have  improved withthe weather.  Retail  sales  reports  have been mixed, with some  contactsreporting weak  sales  in April  and  the  first  part  of May  and othersindicating  some  improvement  in  sales  growth.  In  the  capital  goodsindustries,  contacts  continue to  report  strong  orders  for productssuch  as  machine  tools,  agricultural  equipment,  and heavy-duty  trucks.Steel  output  in  the  District has  strengthened slightly since  thebeginning  of  the  year, but  growth has been  at a  substantially slowerrate  than  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  last  year.  Some  of  our  steelindustry  contacts  report  that  orders  from the  automakers  are  only nowbeing scaled  back.  Softening in  the  domestic  demand  for  steel  may beoffset by  an expected rise  in steel  exports  this  year.In  the agricultural  sector,  corn planting  is  proceeding  atthe  second  slowest pace  in  11  years.  If  the weather  improves  over  thenext  week or  so,  there  is  still  a reasonable  chance  for  achievingaverage yields  this  year.  But  even  with average yields,  productionwould  fall  short  of  current  consumption,  implying above-average  pricesin  the months  ahead.  I should add  that  the  weather forecast  for  thenext  5 to  10  days  is  for more  rain.  Farmland values  and  farmequipment sales  continued  to  rise  in  the  first  quarter despitewidespread  talk of  trimming  farm  income  and price  support programs.On  the employment  front,  labor markets  remain  tight,  with  theDistrict's unemployment  rate at  its  lowest  level  in  over  15  years.But  recent weakness  in  key District  industries,  especially autos,  hasreduced overtime  and  other  labor market pressures  somewhat.Nevertheless,  the  surveys  continue  to  reflect  relative strength  inhiring plans  in  the  second  quarter.  Pockets  of  labor  shortages  inwestern Michigan, Wisconsin, and  Indiana  have  curtailed expansionplans,  adding  to  recruitment  and training  costs  and combining withother  factors  to prompt  price  increases  in  some  industries.  Reportson prices  generally are mixed.  Prices  of  some materials  such ascement,  paper,  and  steel  scrap have been  increasing.  Gypsum boardprices  were  raised about  10  percent  in mid-February, but  one producerreports  some  erosion  in  that  increase  over  the  last  month, and  aplanned  increase  for mid-May was  abandoned.  Similarly,  a number  ofsteel  suppliers  are  reported  to  have  rolled back earlier priceincreases  and the  announced July price hike  for  steel  is  not  expectedto  go  through.  In  fact,  one  mini  mill  has  cut  its  prices  for  a  secondtime.In  terms  of  the  national  outlook,  Mr.  Chairman, I  am  ingeneral  agreement with  the Greenbook.5/23/95-15-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  the  Second Districteconomy remains  fairly  flat.  On balance,  the data  indicate  that  therate  of  job  layoffs  is  slowing, but  job  creations and new businessincorporations have  yet  to  show any kind of  a typical  post-recessionsurge  in growth.  In April,  the unemployment rate  rose  to  6.8  percentin New York and  6.3  percent in New Jersey.  Preliminary  reportssuggest  that  April  retail  sales  were up  only 3 to  5 percent  on  a year-over-year basis  despite  the  favorable  timing  of  Easter,  and merchantsreported widespread disappointment with  such growth.  Everything seemsto be  for  sale  in the  greater New York area.  The realtors  in themetropolitan  area reported that  existing home sales  fell  about  10percent below year-ago  levels  in  the  first  quarter  and  that priceswere  comparably weak.  In  the  same period, vacancy rates  for  primecommercial office  space  rose  throughout  the  greater New York Citymetropolitan area,  largely as  a result  of  ongoing  corporaterestructurings.  The boost  to  business confidence that we  had hopedwould come  from the  change of  government in  New York  State is  notmaterializing.  The new governor has  been completely tied up  in knotsby  the  opposition party, which has  the majority in  the  GeneralAssembly in New York State.  He  is  giving up  a great deal  in  order  toreach an  agreement  on  a state  budget  that  is  still  in the  "hoped for"stage.At  the national  level,  we  have moved  to  such proximity to  theGreenbook  forecast  that  the  closest we can get  to  a disagreement  wouldhave  to  be  described as  a rounding error.  But  we are  looking,  as  Ithink everybody  is,  at  what  developments would point  to weakness andwhat would point  to  strength in  this rather difficult  forecastingperiod.  Obviously,  the  factors pointing to weakness affect mainly theinterest-sensitive sectors,  with consumer durables  weak, especiallyautomobiles,  and housing  starts  down.  On  the  other hand, two  of  themajor channels  of monetary policy point to  strength.  The stock marketis  near record highs;  bond prices are up;  higher household wealth andnet worth of  firms  bode  well  for  spending by households  and  firms;  andthe  declines  in  long-bond rates have  a very positive  effect  on  fixedmortgage rates.  Those  rates  are  at  about 7-3/4  percent, only 3/4percentage point  above  the  levels  in  1993.  So,  I think one  mightanticipate  some bounceback in housing.  There  is  a little evidence  inthat direction, with starts  flat  in April  and  the Mortgage BankersAssociation  survey of  applications  for purchase up  18  percent  in  theweek of  May  12.Our bottom line  is  that  there  is  substantial uncertaintyabout  the  forecast  so  that  an  open mind is  very much  indicated.  Wethink that  the  likely  risk to  the  forecast  is  that  growth will  besomewhat  stronger  than both our  own forecast  and  that  in  theGreenbook, although we  don't  completely dismiss  the  notion  that AlBroaddus  suggested that  the  consumer  could get  spooked by presentweakness and  lose  confidence.  The place where we are  still  a bitdistant  from  the Greenbook  forecast  is  on  inflation.  You may  recallthat at  the  last  meeting we had inflation up  to  3.8  percent  in  1996.We have now modified that  forecast  to  3.6 percent.  So, we  areappreciably less  optimistic  than  the Greenbook, which has  theinflation  rate at  3 percent by the  end of  1996.  There  is  no  reason tosay that  the Greenbook  is  necessarily wrong, but perhaps heartened bythe  fact  that we  caught  the  increase  in  the  spending  level  in  the5/23/95-16-early part  of  this  year we  are  emboldened  to  think that  perhaps  ourforecast of  3.6  percent  might be  more  likely.  After  all,  if  theChicago  Cubs  can be  in  first  place  this  late  in  the  baseball  season,anything can happen!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Economic  activity  in  the First  District  isgrowing at  a very modest  pace.  Payroll  employment  in most  of  themajor industries  in  the  District  is  little  changed since  the  end  of1994.  Services  employment  in particular  seems  to  have  lost  thebuoyancy  of  last  year, but  it  is  too  soon  really  to  tell  whether  thisslowing  reflects  a seasonal  blip or  a more  fundamental change.  Insome ways  we  are happy to  see  the  hospital  industry shedding  jobs,  butfor most  individual  services  industries  the monthly data are  justsimply too  erratic  to  draw many conclusions  at  this  point.  Unlikeservices,  manufacturing  employment  in New England has  been  in  asecular decline,  so  stability constitutes  relatively good performance.In  general  the  old-time  industries  such as  metals,  rubber,  andplastics,  and in  particular paper  are  faring better  than high-techindustries, which  in New England have a  large  defense  component.Anecdotal  evidence  tends  to  support  the  statistical picture.Recent  retail  sales  have been disappointing  and expectations  arelackluster.  Furniture stores  are  especially anxious.  Manufacturingresults  were more positive, but  the pace  of  demand has  slowed sincelast  year.  First  District  companies  express  some  relief  that  auto-related demand has not  fallen more  in  fact  than it  has.  Overseassales  are  said  to  be benefiting  from  the weaker  dollar,  and inparticular  some  of  our  software  companies  are  experiencing upticks  insales  as  a result  of  the  decline of  the  dollar.  Housing constructionis  actually holding up  a little better  in New England than  in  thenation as  a whole.  Sales  of  existing homes  in the  first  quarter  areabout  the  same  as  in the  fourth  quarter,  though down a  little  from ayear ago.  Some  of  our  small  business  contacts  report  that credit  iswidely available, with numerous banks  calling  in search  of  new lendingopportunities.  Markets  are  still  quite  competitive  for  mostbusinesses,  eliminating  the degree  to  which  cost  increases  in  rawmaterials  can be passed  on and emphasizing  the  need  for cost-cuttingand restraints  on wage  increases.Generally, all  the  states  in  the  region  realize  that NewEngland's  slow  recovery has  a large  structural  component  as well  as  acyclical  component.  Much attention  is  being paid in all  the  states  tothe  cost  of  doing business.  This  has  had the  effect  of  bringing downegregiously high costs  such  as  workers'  compensation over  the  lastcouple  of  years.  Recently, there  has  even  been some  movement  in  thearea  of bank  taxes  in Massachusetts.  But  this  movement  in  the  statesalso  has  increased  the  level  of  competition, both among  the  states  inthe  region  and between  the  states  of New England  in general  and otherregions  of  the  country.  We  are  now seeing  the  remaining  largeemployers  in  the  region  openly bargaining with  legislatures  for  thetax  and utility cost breaks  that  they believe are  necessary andholding the  threat  of  imminent moves,  usually  south and west,  over  theheads  of  governments.  Against  the backdrop  of  general  unease  aboutjobs  in particular  and  the  economy in general,  this  is  notcontributing to  an  overall  sense  of  confidence  in  the  region.  Thosechanges  that  inspire  real  structural  adjustments  in  the  cost  of  doing5/23/95-17-business  in New England, and not just  specific  industry cost  breaks,could be  beneficial.On  the national  scene,  I agree with  President  Broaddus  andPresident  McDonough  that  it  is  very  tempting  to  believe  the  Greenbook.It  does  describe  in  the  baseline forecast  the  perfect definition  of  asoft  landing,  and I sincerely hope  that  the  staff  is  right.  However,we  do  remain skeptical--along  the  lines  that  President Broaddus  endedup with  and President McDonough described--that  inflation, as  measuredby  the  core CPI,  can remain  so well  behaved  in  1996  after  a relativelysmall  blip  in  1995.  I hope  that  President Forrestal  is  right  thatinflationary trends  are  simply  cyclical  and are not  showing somewayward  long-term uptick here.  But  I am  skeptical about whether  thatis  true and whether  we are  just  seeing  a pause now rather  than  asomewhat more permanent  downward shift  in demand.  We  could  see  thingsheat up  toward the  end of  the  year, with an  untoward impact  oninflation.

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  growth  in  the  Twelfth Districteconomy  still  has  considerable momentum, although  the pace  ofexpansion has  slowed  recently.  Household job growth in  the  firstquarter was  fast  enough  to  bring the  District's unemployment rate downabout  1/4  percentage point  since  the  end of  last  year.  However,growth  in  District payroll  employment  slowed about  1 percentage  pointin the  first  quarter  relative to  the  1994  pace.  In California,  themoderate recovery has  continued  and the  state and  local  governmentfiscal  climate has  improved a bit,  although one  gets  a differentimpression  from recent  articles  in  the Wall  Street  Journal  and  the NewYork Times.  Payroll  employment growth  through April  of  this  yearcontinued  at  near  last year's  pace.Orange  County is  reported to  have moved closer  to  reaching anagreement with bondholders  to  reschedule about  $1 billion  in  short-term  debt  that  begins  to  come  due  in  early July.  Some bondholdershave been  lobbying  the  state government  to  help the  county honor  itsobligations as  originally  scheduled.  Thus  far,  the  state governmenthas distanced  itself  from Orange  County's  woes,  actually leaving  it  tothe  county's  residents  to  finance  eventual  debt  repayment.  The  spreadbetween  California state  government bond yields  and  other  similarlyrated municipal  bond yields  has  remained well below the peak attainedwhen  the Orange  County crisis  first  erupted.  California's  own  fiscalsituation, we believe,  has  improved noticeably, although a substantialamount  of  the  debt  that  accumulated during  the  recession remains  to  beworked  off.  The  earlier California deficits  were  financed largely bya run-up  in  loans  to  the  general  fund  of  about  $6 billion.  Morerecently,  state  government revenues  have  firmed with the  pickup  ineconomic  activity, creating moderate budget  surpluses  and allowing apayback of  about  $1 billion of  these  loans.Turning to  the  national economy,  our  forecast  is  about  thesame  as  the Greenbook  forecast.  We  certainly agree that  output  isgoing  to  be weak  in  the  near term  as  businesses work  off  excessinventories.  While  there  is  some uncertainty  about how sharp  thiscorrection might  be, we  do not  expect  it  to be prolonged.  Inparticular, we  expect  final  sales  to  keep growing  at  or  even  somewhatabove  the  growth  rate  of  potential  output  through next year.  We5/23/95-18-expect CPI  inflation to  stay  slightly above  3 percent  over  the  periodas  the beneficial  effects  of  the  recent  slowdown  in wage  inflation  areoffset by inflationary pressures  from  the  dollar  and  the  rising pricesof  intermediate  goods.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

MR. BOEHNE.  Looking  at  the  available  statistics,  the  ThirdDistrict  economy clearly has  slowed  in  recent months  across  a broadfront,  including manufacturing, retailing, and residentialconstruction.  Looking beyond  the  statistics,  however,  I  think what  weare  seeing is  a downward adjustment  in  the  rate  of growth  rather thana  cumulative decline  in  economic  activity.  Both business  and consumerattitudes  in  the  District still  seem positive.  Rail  transportationactivity,  often a good  indicator of  manufacturing activity,  seems  tobe  bottoming out  except  for  autos.  The  slowing  of office  leasingseems  to  be more  from  short  supply  than weak demand in  the  District,  apositive sign  for  future building, and  lower mortgage  rates  are  apositive  for housing activity.On  the  inflation  front  in  the  District,  I  think we need tolook beyond the  current  statistics  as  well.  Although  there  is  someuptick in  the  rate  of  inflation,  I doubt  that  what  we  are  seeing  is  acumulative  upturn  in  the  rate  of  inflation,  but  rather  a temporarycyclical  upturn that  is  not  sustainable  in  the  current  climate  ofmoderating demand pressures,  stiff  competition  for  sales,  and  subduedwage and benefit  increases.Turning  to  the national  economy, my views  are  similar  to whatis  happening  in  the District.  The national  economy  in my view ismaking a downward adjustment  in  the  rate  of  growth  rather  than  goingthrough the  early phase of  a cumulative  downturn.  And the  economy isexperiencing a temporary uptick  in  inflation rather  than  the beginningof  a  cumulative upturn.  Nonetheless,  while  I am  still  reasonablyconfident about  the prospects  for  a  soft  landing,  I think we  need  tobe  very  sensitive  to  incoming  information.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman, the  Tenth District  generallyremains  strong with some  signs  of  modest  slowing  starting to  emerge.Overall,  though,  the  District's  sectors  generally are  continuing  toexhibit  strength and our  directors  do  report  consistently healthygrowth  across  the  region.  For  example,  recent  monthly employment  datashow broad-based growth.  Our nonfarm jobs  in  the  District were  upalmost  4 percent  in  March from  a year earlier.  In  six of  our  sevenstates  the  rate  of  job  growth  is  exceeding  the  nation's pace,  and NewMexico  continues  to  rank among the  top  states.  Manufacturing  activityremains  robust  across  the  region.  Durable goods  producers  have beenadding  jobs  at  a  fairly consistent  rate,  even recently.  In  fact,while  there  has  been  some reduction  in overtime  in  our automanufacturing plants,  they have continued in  some  instances  to  hirenew workers  in  the  last  three months.  There  is  strong  growth  innonresidential  building within  our District.  We also  have  seen  loangrowth continuing  at  double-digit rates  over  the  last  two  months.As  I said,  though, there  are  some  signs  of  slowing in  ourregional  economy.  There has  been  a little  sluggishness  in  retail5/23/95-19-sales  according to  reports  from our  directors  and  some  of  our  otherDistrict contacts.  Residential  building activity also  has  slowedrecently.  And as  others  have mentioned, wet  weather has  led tosubstantial  delays  in  planting  spring crops,  pointing  to  a slightlymore  difficult year  for  some of  our  farmers.  Overall  wage/pricepressures  remain moderate  in  the  District,  but  there  are veryscattered  indications  of  emerging pressures.On  the national  level,  our view  is  in  line with  the  Boardstaff's  projections.  We  also believe  that  the projections  are  subjectto  considerable uncertainty.  Our  sense  at  this  stage  is  that  therisks  to  the  projections  remain  on  the up  side.  A  couple of  examples:I think  that  consumer  spending could remain  strong  in  future months  asemployment  income  continues  to  grow.  Consumer  confidence  remainsrelatively  good and household balance  sheets  are  in  good condition.  Ithink there  is  some  potential  strength in  our export  sector,  given  thedepreciation of  the  dollar,  as  others  have  indicated.  The housingsector  could turn  stronger with  long-term rates  having come  down alittle.  So,  I think there  is  some  risk  on  the up  side  and  that  is  apossible  area  for continued  inflation concerns.  While  I agree  thatthe  situation is  uncertain,  I  think we  do have  to  be  diligent  inwatching  those  inflation numbers.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

MR. MCTEER.  Employment  growth  in  the  Eleventh District  hasslowed  somewhat  in recent  months.  Beginning  in  the  second  quarter  of1989,  the  Eleventh District had  22  consecutive  quarters  of  fasteremployment  growth  than  the United  States as  a whole.  In  the past  twoquarters,  our  employment  growth has  converged with  the U.S.  rate  andit  is  now only about  average.  The  impact of  the  peso crisis  in Mexicois  no  doubt  an important  factor  in  the relative  slowing  in  theEleventh  District,  as  trade  with Mexico  is  roughly four  times asimportant  for us  as  it  is  for  the  country as  a whole.  The  index ofleading  indicators  for Texas peaked  last  August and has  been fairlyweak since  then.  The weakest  component  of  that  index  is  the Texasvalue  of  the  dollar because  the peso  is  so  important  in  the Southwest.We are,  however,  encouraged by  the rapid adjustment  in  the Mexicantrade balance  and  the  fact  that  it  has  come  more  from  increasingMexican exports  than  from declining Mexican  imports.  On  the  inflationside, we  are not  getting new reports  of  accelerating wages  and pricepressures  in  District  surveys  and in  our  discussions.On  the national  scene,  the  slowdown  has been  fairly sharp,even sharper  than  is  reflected  in  the  fourth-  and  first-quarter GDPnumbers.  Growth  in  real  final  sales  went  from  5.7  percent  to  1.8percent,  a  fairly sharp decline.  Of  course,  this  has been accompaniedby  sharp reductions  in  intermediate-  and long-term  interest rates.The yield curve  is  getting considerably  flatter.  If  one  looks  at  agraph of  the  slope of  the yield curve plotted  against  business  cycledates,  it  tends  to  make one  a little  bit nervous.  Generally when  theyield curve  becomes negative, when  short-term interest  rates  are  beingincreased  relative  to  long-term rates,  a recession  follows.  However,I think,  as  Al  Broaddus  indicated, that  a natural  correction occurs  inthe  economy when  interest rates  can  weaken as  a result  of weakeningeconomic activity.  We have  to  be  cautious  not  to  stand in  the way ofthat  for  too  long.  The yield curve  is  not  negative yet,  but  it  isgetting  closer and  that  puts  us  in  a more precarious  position, given5/23/95-20-the  game  of  chicken  that  the Administration is  playing with Japan  overtrade policies.  So,  the  conditions  for  some  unstable  financial  marketactivities, both domestic  and  foreign,  are  there.  We  should becautious  in the months  ahead.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  The economy of  the  Ninth  District  is  similar  towhat has been reported in virtually all  the  other Districts.  The paceof  expansion has  slowed.  But  I must  say the  tenor  of  the  informationand  anecdotes  that  have  come  in suggests  to  me  that,  relative to  thenumbers  that  we have  seen  for  the  national  economy, the  Districteconomy remains pretty  sound.  The  strength  is  concentrated right nowin basic  industries.  Pulp  and paper production  is  strong;  iron  andcopper mining  is  strong;  energy exploration has  picked up.  I woulddescribe sentiment  as  cautious  but not  negative.  There  has been  someconcern expressed about what might  follow  from  the battle with Japanon  the  auto parts  issue,  and whether  that  could  inhibit  some  of  ourproducers  who  currently export  non-auto related  goods  to  Japan.  Butindustry attitudes  don't  seem to  be particularly negative.  Laborusual  that  does  not  seem  to  be  translating  into broad-based wagepressures.  A  couple  of  mortgage  bankers  that  I ran  into  recently haveexpressed growing  optimism.  I gather  their volume has  picked up.With regard  to  the  national  economy,  I don't have  any seriousproblems with  the soft  landing pattern  in  the  Greenbook forecast.  Iwould observe  that  it  not  only is  a soft  landing but  it  is  a ratherquick one.  It  only  takes  a couple  of  quarters  of  below-trendexpansion  before we  get  back  to  what  appears  to  be  trend or  steadystate.  And  I guess  I am  struck  that  even  if  things work out  thatwell,  that  means  in  some  sense  that  we are  going  to  be  looking  atsubpar numbers  on  the national  economy  for at  least  six months,  thatis,  into  October  or November.  We probably ought  to  recognize  that  upfront  and gird ourselves  to be patient  if,  in  fact, we  get  incomingevidence  on  the national  economy  of  that  nature.  That's  inherent  inthe  forecast  and that  seems  to  be  what we ought  to  be  expecting, atleast  as  the most  likely  scenario.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thank you, Alan.  The pace of  Eighth  Districteconomic  activity, while  decelerating modestly  in  some areas,  exhibitsfew  signs  of  a pending  slump.  Unemployment  in  the major  Districtstates remained at  4-1/2  percent  in March, well below  the  nationalaverage.  Parts  of  the District  continue  to  report  tight  labor marketconditions  for  both entry-level  and  skilled workers.  Many businessesin  the District  report  slowing  economic  activity, but  they generallydo  not view  this  as  a precursor  to  a  sustained downturn  in  the  nearfuture--very similar  to  other  reports  we have heard today.  Instead,the  consensus  is  for  further  growth  in  sales  and  employment,  althoughat  a slower pace  than recently  experienced.  New residentialconstruction  in  the  District  is  below  last  year's  level,  but  1994 wasa record year  in  many areas.  Anecdotal  reports  support  the  potentialfor  a revival  in housing activity with  the  recent  decline  in  long-termrates.  Commercial  construction  continues  to  increase  at  a  steady paceas  vacancy rates  decline  and rental  rates  increase.  The  officevacancy rate  in  the  St.  Louis  area,  for  instance,  has  fallen  to  about5/23/95-21-13  percent,  its  lowest  level  in  ten years.  Total  commercial  andindustrial  loans  outstanding at  the  largest  District  banks  rose  6.1percent between mid-February and mid-April.  Planned auto productionat  District plants  is  contrary to  the  recent national  trends.Scheduled  second-quarter production  of  more  than  280,000  unitsrepresents an  increase  of more  than  3 percent  above  the  number ofunits  scheduled  at  the  time  of  the last  FOMC meeting and  is  also  3percent  above  the number  of  units  produced in  the  second quarter  of1994.  I would associate  this  with the  fact  that  some popularvehicles,  like  the  Ford  Explorer,  some minivans,  and other models,dominate  a lot  of  the production  in  our  District.Nationally, the economy  seems  to  be  slowing  further,  thoughthere  are reasons  for  optimism over  the  remainder of  1995  as  a numberof  people pointed out.  But  the  central  concern of  this  Committeeshould be  inflation,  and the pace  of  price  increases  is  picking up.The annualized growth  rate of  the  CPI  was  4.9 percent  in April.  Thisindex has  risen at  a 3.6  percent  annual  rate  since December, up  from a2.7  percent rate  of  increase over  the  last  half  of  1994.  In  contrastto  the Greenbook, which has CPI  inflation peaking in  the  currentquarter, many private  forecasters  expect  inflation  to  rise  throughout1995.  Most worrisome  from the  perspective  of  this  Committee  arelonger-term  inflation  forecasts  that  indicate  that  market  participantsexpect  inflation at  or  above its  current  level  for horizons  as  long asfive  or  ten years.  So-called  low inflation  of  3 percent  or more  isendemic  in  the present U.S.  economy and  is  being built  into  exchangerates,  long-term  interest rates,  budget planning,  contractnegotiations,  and economic  forecasts.  We are  far  from  convincingprices.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  A  few weeks  ago,  in  the  last  couple  of  days  orso  of April,  I attended a meeting of  over  100  business  and civicleaders  from  northeast Ohio.  Martin Feldstein made  a presentation  tothe  group and  answered questions.  His prepared remarks  were aboutMexico, but  during  the  question-and-answer period, Marty was  askedabout  the  economy,  the  outlook, and policies.  He  commented at  thatpoint  that  the  unemployment rate  was  too  low and we  should continuetightening monetary policy until  we raise  the  unemployment rate  toabout  the  6 percent  level  in  order  to prevent  inflation  fromaccelerating  from the  current  level.  After  the  session  the presidentof one  of  the  companies asked me  if  I still  believed  in  zeroinflation,  and  I told him  that  I did.  He  then asked me how high  Iwanted the  unemployment  rate  to be  pushed up  if  Feldstein  thought  itneeded  to be  pushed up  to  6 percent  to  hold  inflation  steady.  Ofcourse,  I tried to  explain that  I did not want  the unemployment  ratepushed up  at  all but  that  the  objective  of  moving  toward pricestability was  in  fact  to  move the  unemployment rate  down  and maintainit  at  a  lower  level.  After  that  exchange  and then  talking  with agroup  of  business  leaders  last  week, I was  struck by just  howdifficult  it  would be  to  generate  broad public  support,  let  alonenarrower  political  support,  for  the  idea  of  price  stability as  long  aswe couch  our  argument  in  terms  of  putting a  floor under  theunemployment  rate.  The  idea  of  using a minimum  level  of  unemploymentas  an  instrument  in  order  to  achieve  the  objective of  price  stabilitysimply is  never  going  to  be very popular with anybody.5/23/95-22-When  I  look at unemployment  rates in  Ohio  and also  inmetropolitan areas  and other parts  of  our District,  I am puzzled aboutwhy those  rates  do not  fit  with  the  stories  that  we  usually hear andsee  in  print.  We have  a  lot  of  metropolitan areas  that  report  theirunemployment rates  officially as  under  3 percent.  When we  talk  to  thepeople  in  the area,  they  say they have effectively no  unemployment.They usually do make  the distinction  that  there are a  lot  of  peoplewho do  not have  any work  to  do,  but  those  people have jobs--they workin the  city governments  and the  school  districts!  The  state  of Ohiohas  overall  unemployment of  4 percent,  the  lowest of  the big  elevenstates,  and our manufacturing  employment  is  double  the nationalaverage, measured  as  a share  of  total  employment.If  we have  some  idea  concerning which we can be reasonablyconfident  in  terms  of  potential,  it has  to be  generally in  the  goodsproducing  sectors  of  the  economy  and more  specifically inmanufacturing.  That  is  the  largest  share  of  the  Ohio  economy andparts  of  the  central  Kentucky  economy, down  around Lexington and  inthat  corridor.  And yet, we don't  see  that  these  reported  levels  ofunemployment  are  being reflected  in people's  thinking  about  futureinflation,  let  alone materializing  in  terms  of  wage pressures.  Ourwage  increases  in  the  District  are  well  below the national  average.Now, one  conjecture could be  that  it  is  a good  thing  that  there  are alot  of  unemployed  aerospace workers  in  southern California, given  thenumber  of people working and producing  motor vehicles  in Ohio.Otherwise, we would have  a lot  of  inflation.  And if  those people  inLong Beach  find  jobs,  I guess  we are  going  to have  to  lay some  peopleoff  in  Toledo!  I was  in Toledo  last  week talking to  about  100  bankersfrom within a  50-mile  radius,  and  they were  complaining  that  theirunemployment  is  close  to  the national  average.  They said  it  wasaround 5.7  percent,  and they were  trying  to  attract people  into  job-creating activities  to  lower  their  unemployment rate  because--eventhough  the  rate  is  at  the national  average--it  is  quite high  for  thisregion  of  the  country as  far  as  they are  concerned.  So  I thought,well,  if  they  are  successful  in  lowering  the  unemployment rate  inToledo we  will have  to  lay off  some people  in  Dayton or Columbus,  orelse we are  going  to  have  too  low unemployment and somehow this  isgoing  to  influence  the  purchasing power  of  money.People  that  I listen  to  about what  is  going  on around  theDistrict usually perceive  the problems  to  be  in  somebody else's  partof  the  country.  Yes,  auto  sales  have  fallen, but  that  is  notaffecting  the production  of  cars  here  and  so  they  feel  employment  isvery good  and our area  is  immune  to  whatever  is  happening  in Tennesseeor  wherever.  The  steel people,  similar  to  what Mike Moskow reported,are  experiencing very strong  demand but  also  are planning a  lot  ofadditional  capacity, especially the mini  mills  that  will  come onstream  over  the  next  couple of  years.  One  of  our  directors  said thatearlier  this  year he  had been  looking  for  a 3 to  5 percent  increase  inposted  steel  prices  on July  1.  He  said  that  will  not  take  place.Even if  the  steel  mills  posted  the  increase,  they would not  be  able  toget  it,  so  there  is  not going  to  be  another  steel  price  increase.Builders report  that  residential construction  is  above where  it  was  atthis  time  last  year.  Nonresidential  construction is  considerablyabove where  it was  before,  so  the  investment  side  of  the  economy  stilllooks  quite good  to  us.  Agriculture  is  a different  story,  though.  Inparticular,  there  are  a  lot  of  concerns  about grains.  It  is  reportedthat  because of  sharply higher  fertilizer  costs,  fuel  costs,  and5/23/95-23-interest rates,  average production  costs  this  year  for  the  corn  cropare  about  10  percent  lower.  So,  farmers plan to  make that  up  onvolume  once  it  stops  raining.Turning  to  the national  economy,  I have  a  lot  of  trouble withthe  rhetoric  about  a soft  landing.  If  all  the  commentary  that we  seein  the press  is  going  to  be in  terms  of  an  airplane  analogy, I wishthey would talk  about  leveling  off  at  cruising altitude.  That'sbecause  I think a landing  should not  be  the  objective  at  all  to  themajority of  the American public;  continuing  to  fly ought  to  be  theobjective.  Since  I have  a general  view that  a market  economy tends  toallocate  its  resources  to  their best uses  in  the  absence of  some  realshocks  or perverse policies, when  I think about where  the  economymight  stabilize  in  terms  of  growth rates  I  try to  think in  terms  ofwhat  is  going  to prevent  it--whether monetary policy,  fiscal  policy,oil  shocks,  or  something  else.  The  one we  are  concerned with, ofcourse,  is  monetary policy.  So,  I ask myself whether  I believe  thatwhat  I see  in  the Greenbook  is  at  least  consistent,  whether  or not  Ithink  it  is  right.  And I have  trouble  with  the  assumptions  about theinterest  rate  structure, both  the  level  of  the  funds  rate  and  the  risein bond yields,  and the  associated growth rates  of  nominal  GDP, realoutput,  and all  the  component parts.  I don't  know which one  of  thoseis  wrong, but  I think that  one  of  them  is.  Either  the  interest ratestructure  is  too  high or  the  forecast  of  output  and inflation  that  thestaff  is  presenting  is  too  low, and  at  some point we  are  going  to  haveto  reconcile  those--raise  our assumptions  about  output  and inflationor accept  the  idea  that  a  lower  structure of  interest  rates  is  goingto  be  consistent with  it.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to  me  that we  are  in  aclassic wait-and-see period here.  The expansion  is  obviously slowingand  there  are  a  lot of  factors,  which have been well  aired here  thismorning,  that  could  take  the  economy in  the  direction  of  eithergreater near-term or  longer-term weakness  or  strength.  It  is  just  tooearly right now  to be  making  firm judgments  about what  the  economy isgoing to  look like  over  the  forecast period.  In  the near  term,  itwould seem  to me  that  the  inventory  cycle and how that  plays  out  isthe  dominant  factor.  If  final  sales  hold up,  it  is  hard for me  to  seehow  inventories  are  going  to  be  a  terribly big problem.  Inventory-sales  ratios  overall  are  still modest.  I think  there  are  good reasonsto  believe  that  final  sales  will hold up  and maybe  rebound  some.  Wehave  the wealth  effects  from the  stock and bond markets.  Confidenceis  still high.  Long  rates  are  down  and that  should  help housing andkick in  here  at  a very  opportune time.  And particularly  if  that  playsout  well,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  out-period risks  continue  to  belargely on  the  high side.  That  has  been  stated in  a number  ofcontexts by  several people who  have  spoken  already, and  I am stillvery much  in  that  camp.  So,  I think we  are  some  distance  away--I  amnot  sure how  far,  of  course--from a decision point.  But  in my view weare  at  least  one  meeting, maybe a number  of  meetings  away.  Thank you.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  The predicted  slowdown is  well  under way.  Itseems  to  be pretty widespread, led by housing and consumer durables.Business  investment  is  likely to  be  off  in  1995  relative  to  1994,  butstill  strong enough  to provide  a reasonable cushion during  thisslowdown period.  It  appears  that  only the  auto manufacturers  havebeen  somewhat  surprised by the  slowdown  and that  is  even moresurprising,  given the  fact  that it  was probably one  of  the  bestforecast  slowdowns  that we  have  had in  a long  time.  The  inventoryadjustment, which may be  largely an  auto phenomenon, may well  causethe  second-quarter  slowdown to  be  deeper than would qualify us  for aperfect  soft  landing  or a perfect  "riding off  into  the  horizon" atsome  specified altitude.The market  side  seems  to be  consistent with a sustainablegrowth outlook.  The dollar has  rallied;  the yield  curve has  flattenedout  rather nicely;  and long-term rates  have declined, partly  I hopedue  to  lowered inflation expectations.  But  there  is  also  a fairamount  of  attention being paid to  the  deficit reduction  efforts  thatare under way.  I think that  the  short-term rate  declines  are probablyreversing  the  overshooting that occurred when the  general  sentimentwas  that we were going  to be  tightening policy.  Stock pricesgenerally  are  up  this year but  so  are  earnings,  and price-earningsratios  are  not dramatically out  of  line  with historical averages.Several people have cited the  positive benefits  of  the wealth  effectfrom both the  stock market  and perhaps  even  from  the bond market.  Ithink these  market adjustments, given the  shocks  that  have occurred inthe markets  in the  last  couple  of  years,  pretty well  demonstrate theresilience  of  the  markets.  Banks  and other  lenders  appear  to  be  ableto  support  growth as  needed, so  I don't  think we  are  looking  at abottleneck with respect  to  the  availability of  credit.On  the price  side,  cyclical  pressures  clearly are  showingthrough in  the  core CPI  now, but  I don't  think we have a firmindication  that this  is  a permanent  ratcheting up.  We have had someeasing off with respect  to  capacity utilization recently, both  inlabor and product  markets.  It  doesn't  appear that,  at  least  for  themoment, wage pressures  are  consistently building, but  I do  think weneed  to  exercise  a fair amount  of  vigilance with  respect  to  inflation.Any time we have rising  inflation, we  have  to be wary as  to whether weare  facing  a temporary  cyclical  situation  or whether we are  seeing  thebuildup  of  a permanently higher  inflation rate.In  sum, now that  the  slowdown is  under way,  it  seems  to  methat  the  risks  to  the  economy are  a bit  better balanced than  they wereearlier.  There  are  some wild cards  in  the  outlook, and several peoplehave mentioned a number  of  them.  One that  I would point  to  is  whethersome  deficit reduction  is  going to  be enacted  into  law.  And if  it  is,who  is  going  to  be affected and by how much?  I don't believe we haveadequately built  that  into  our projections.  Nor do  I think we haveadequately  factored in  the potential  trade  war with Japan, whateverthat may mean.  On  a not unrelated  factor,  we have had a shock  to  thedollar.  How that  is  going  to  play out  in  the  U.S.  economy has yet  tobe seen.  So  I agree with Mike Kelley.  We  seem to  be  in a wait-and-see posture  at  this  point.  The Committee  is  going to  have  to  continueto  assess  whether some  of  these  wild cards  are  going to  affect  thedelicate balance that  currently seems  to  be  moving us  toward a softlanding, notably how this  inventory  imbalance will  play itself  out.So, we  have  a period of  sharp vigilance  ahead.5/23/95-25-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr.  Chairman, I  think  I am  going  to  be  aminority here.  Two  things concern me,  one  of  which has  not beenmentioned at  all  and  that  is  credit  conditions.  It  was  pointed outthat  there  has  been a  lot  of  easing  of  credit  terms.  At  some pointthat  is  going to  stop.  Having  arrived here  at  a very  scary time  in1991,  I am getting a  little nervous  that we may be  setting ourselvesup  for  another pro-cyclical move  in  our credit  terms  that  might  end upexacerbating the  next  business cycle.  Our surveys,  for example,  areall  saying  that  credit  terms  are  easing.  In  the  last month  I musthave had  four delegations  of  bankers  through my office  complaining notonly  that  their competitors  were  easing conditions, but  that  they wereeasing conditions  too much.  Please  stop me  from doing  it  to  myselfwas  their message!  That  has  to  be  of  some  concern.  I think it  alsois  showing up  in  the  data.  I remember getting briefings  shortly afterarriving here  to  the  effect  that  never again  in  this  millenium wouldanother office building be  built  in America, and yet  cranes  are backon  the  horizon just  2-1/2  years  later.  Similarly with household debt,1.2  billion credit  card solicitations were mailed out  to  the Americanpeople  in  the  first  quarter of  1995.  That  is  five  for  every man,woman, and  child in  the  country.  So,  I suppose  if  I were  typical  Iwould have  to  say,  now  that  my  three-year-old has  three  cards  and myone-year-old has  two,  that  I  should keep  accepting new cards.  This  iscertainly not the  kind of environment  that  is  sustainable.  I wouldpoint  out  that  the Greenbook  forecast  for  1996  has  a decline  in thesaving  rate  from  1995  in  order  to  sustain  the  rate  of  consumptiongrowth.  Furthermore,  even  the  higher  1995  saving  rate  is  notsufficient  to  slow  the rise  in  the  ratio  of  installment debt  topersonal  income, which means  that  it  is  going  to  rise  even  faster  in1996.  Well,  at  some  point  that  is  going to  stop;  forty-four  percentof all  PCE  growth  last  year was  financed  through  installment debt,  andthat  can't  go  on  forever.  At  some point  either  the  banks  are  going  tostop  it  themselves  or we  are going  to  stop  it  when,  for example,  wehave  a profits  downturn or  a cash  flow downturn  and suddenly all  thesebackward-looking assumptions  our  examiners make  about  the quality ofthe balance  sheet begin  to  go  in  reverse.  I don't know when  that  isgoing  to  happen,  but  I know  it  is  going  to  exacerbate  the  downturnwhen it  comes.Second, on  fiscal policy, we  also  have to  be  a bit  forward-looking  and make  the  call.  The  question that  Mike  raised  is  whetheror not Congress  will  follow  through or whether  there will  be  somemoderation in  the  fiscal  policy actions.  We  can make  a bet  eitherway.  There  are  four  reasons  why  I think Congress  is  going  to  followthrough.  The  first  has  to  do with  the  decision to  take  on Medicare.All  the  campaign  ads  attacking  the  incumbents  are already made  for1996.  The  advocates  of  Medicare  cuts  have  heard the  charge  that  oldpeople will  be  pulled out  of  their sick beds  and  tossed  onto  the  curband  everything else.  These members  of  Congress  already know that  theyare  going  to  face  that  kind  of  attack, so  they may as  well  get  somepluses  out  of  this  situation.  The  only pluses  they  can get are  tosave  the Medicare  system  from  default  and reduce  the  budget deficit.There  is  no point  in  stopping now because  they  already have  incurredthe  political  cost.  Second,  I think the  party discipline which wasexpected  to break  down on hard votes  has not done  so.  There were  237votes  in  the  House  for  the  reconciliation bill--they  lost  5Republicans  and gained  12  Democrats  on  the vote.  Party discipline  is5/23/95-26-not breaking down  and won't  this  year.  Third,  in  the power  structurebetween  the  Congress and  the Executive  Branch, we have a return  towhat Madison had in mind when he  envisioned a spendthrift  king beingchecked by the  taxpayers'  representatives  in  the  legislature.  Thatwas  the model  for most of  the  republic's  history.  It  was  reversedlegislatively in the  1974 Budget Act,  and the picture we  all  have nowconcerning how compromises are  struck is  based on  the  last  20  years.In  fact,  the  default  option  in  fiscal policy is  zero.  The  Presidentwho wants  to  spend more  than the  Congress  does not  have a credibleveto  threat because  the  default  option will  produce  less  than he  wantsto  spend.  That  is  going  to become  clear as  we  move  through  the  12appropriations bills  this  fall.  In the  end, it  is  going to  beCongress  that  is  going  to pass  a reconciliation bill.  Such a billcan't be  filibustered and the  President  will  have the  choice  ofshutting down  the entire  government  or  signing the  reconciliationbill.  Every president  has  bowed in  the past  and presidents willcontinue  to  bow to  the more powerful position in  negotiations  thatCongress  has.  Finally, there  is  a temptation  to  lock  these  changes  inplace.  If  the Medicare cuts  are  enacted, then point-of-order ruleswill  require  that  any  increase  in  spending be paid for.  And if  youwant  to  enact  reforms that  are going to  survive,  and arguably  that  iswhat  some  of  the  leadership wants  to  do,  then  the  time  to  put  thosechanges  in  is now.Logically,  I don't  understand how the process  is  not  going  toend up with a substantial  fiscal contraction  in  1996.  Frankly, Ithink  the yield curve  is  indicating  that  that  is  the  expectation.  Ifit  is  true  that  we are  not  going to  have growth  in the  low 2's  butgrowth in  the mid 1's--there  is  a real  risk  in waiting  to  find  out,assuming the  lags  in monetary policy remain what they  have been  inthis  cycle.  If  we wait,  say, until  the  autumn, our  rate reductionswould have  their effects  about  the  time  that  the  second round offiscal  reductions  would hit  in  the  fiscal  1997  budget.  That  iscertainly  a risk.  There also  is  a risk  in moving now because we  aregoing  to  see  oscillations  in  the  likelihood of  fiscal  policy restraintactually passing.  I don't  think we want  to  get  involved in  that  game.So,  we  have a tough call  to  make.On net,  I think  that monetary policy is  probably a littletighter  than we  want  it  to  be, but  our regulatory policy is  a littleeasier  than we want  it  to  be.  What  I am afraid we  are  settingourselves  up  for  is  another situation  where we  reverse  monetarypolicy, and end up with  too  easy a monetary policy and  too  tight  aregulatory policy.  We end up with the pushing-on-a-string phenomenonwe  saw during  1991  and  1992.  I would urge  earlier action  in bothareas  to  avoid that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  As  I evaluate  the most  recent  set  of  economicdata,  I remain quite  optimistic  that  we will  achieve  the  soft  landingprojected in  the Greenbook, with growth  slowing below  trend during1995  and rising back toward trend  in  1996,  and with inflationremaining  contained  during the  process.  Historically, of  course, softlandings have  rarely been  achieved, but  this  time  it  seems  to  me thatthe preconditions  are  better.  First, any overshoot  of potentialoutput  that has  occurred thus  far  is  relatively small  in  contrast  topast cycles.  Second,  inflation has  remained remarkably well5/23/95-27-contained.  Third, inflationary expectations  have  not risen.  Fourth,we now have  clear evidence  of  a significant  slowdown under way, butthere  is  little  evidence  of  any  inventory  overhang outside  theautomobile and housing sectors,  and I think  that  limits  thepossibility of a hard  landing.One of  the  favorable  factors  affecting  the  outlook  is  that,in  the words  of  the  Greenbook,  "labor costs  remain under  remarkablerestraint."  Increases  in compensation  are running significantly belowforecasts  based on econometric  wage  equations.  Benefit  cost  increaseshave  slowed  substantially, and  there has been no  offset,  at  least  thusfar,  in  the  form of  higher wages  and salaries.  In recognition  of  thatfact,  the  Greenbook has  revised downward  its  forecast of  hourlycompensation growth.  But with core  inflation behaving  about asexpected,  thus  far  at  least,  the  Greenbook forecast  of  core  inflationhas been revised downward by less.  That  strikes me  as  a reasonableassumption  for  the  short  run,  but  if  the  compensation  surprisepersists over  the  longer run,  it  is  quite  likely  that  we will  seecompensation  restraint showing  through  to  restraint  in  core  inflation,and we will  end up with  a slightly more  favorable  inflation trend  aswell.  In  that  sense,  I think the  forecast contains  some  downwardrisks  on  the  inflation side,  but  it  is  really  too  soon  to  know whetherthis  compensation surprise  will  turn  out  to  be  transitory orpermanent.  If  it  is  permanent,  that  would  imply a decline  in  thenatural rate  of  unemployment.  At  a minimum,  the  economy is  in effectexperiencing a  favorable  supply  shock, which  is  quite welcome  in  aperiod where  the economy may have  overshot potential  output and  thereis  continuing pressure  from  the prices  of  intermediate materials  andimports.As  I evaluate  the  risks  in  the  forecast with respect  to  realGDP  growth,  they seem  to  me  to  be roughly balanced at  the  presenttime.  I do  have  a  few concerns on  the down  side.  First,  I amconcerned about  the possibility, which Governor  Lindsey emphasized,that  the personal  saving rate may not  decline  as  much from  its  currentfirst-quarter  level  of  5.1  or  5.2  percent as  the  Greenbook  assumes,and hence  that  PCE  growth may be  less  strong.  Over  the  last  twoyears,  personal  consumption expenditures  have been buoyed by strongspending on  durable goods.  In  line  with  the Greenbook,  I think  it  isquite  likely  that  the  growth  of  spending on  durables  will  slowsubstantially because  a significant portion of  the  earlier  spendingprobably went  to  satisfy pent-up demand.  Now,  it  seems natural  toexpect  the personal  saving  rate as  measured  in  the  national  income andproduct  accounts,  which include  expenditures  on  durables,  to  rise whenspending on  durables  is  weak and  to  fall  when spending  on durables  isstrong  simply because  durable goods  provide a  flow of  services  over  along  time  horizon and  are  thus  a  form of  savings  from the  households'perspective.  In  fact,  this  is  the  assumption  that  is  embodied  in theBoard's MPS  model.  Now, the Greenbook assumes  that  the NIPA personalsaving rate  will  decline,  as  Governor  Lindsey mentioned,  to  4.4  or  4.5percent  in  1996,  and  that  is  a level  somewhat  above  its  4.1 percentaverage  in  1993  and 1994  when consumption  of  durables  was  so  strong.But  it  is  well  below its  5-1/4 percent  average  for  1991  and  1992.  Myconcern  is  that  that  assumption may  be  too  optimistic,  and sinceconsumption  is  such  a large  fraction  of  total  expenditures,  an errorhere can have  significant repercussions  for  the  forecast.5/23/95-28-A  second  downside  risk  comes  from  the potential  spillovereffects  of  the  inventory adjustment  currently under way in  theautomobile  sector, which is  forecast  to  depress  real  GDP growth  in  thecurrent  and subsequent  quarters.  I don't  want  to  quarrel  with  theGreenbook analysis  here;  it  is  just  that  I always worry that  there  isa possibility of  significant repercussions  through  the  multiplier  ifhouseholds  cut  consumption  in response  to  a decline  in  income  andthrough the  accelerator process  if  investment  slows  down  in  responseto  a decline  in  the  growth rate  of  real  GDP,  especially at  a  time whencapacity constraints  are easing.  I am simply  saying  that  thesespillovers could  turn  out  to  be  greater  than  the Greenbook assumes.Governor Lindsey has  done an  excellent  job of  describing the  risksfrom fiscal  policy, and  I share his  concerns.Of  course,  there  are also  risks  on  the up  side.  As ViceChairman McDonough noted,  these work through  interest rates,  exchangerates,  and  the  stock market.  The Greenbook  assumes  that  the bondintermediate-  and  long-term bond yields  will  be  reversed.  If  thisassumption proves  false,  it  is  conceivable  that  interest-sensitivesectors will  rebound,  turning a  slowdown  into  a pause.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I'll  be mercifully brief as  the  last  speaker.Except  for a  few details,  one  of  which  I mentioned about  capacityutilization  and a  few more which I will mention  in a moment,  I thinkthe  Greenbook  forecast  is  pretty  reasonable both on  the  real  and  thenominal  fronts.  I would shade  it  a bit  lower  on real  growth  in  thenear  term, more  like  DRI's  forecast  than  the  Greenbook forecast,reflecting my view that  in  the  short  term  the downside  risks  exceedthe upside  risks.  I say that  without  a great deal  of  conviction;  Idon't want  to  exaggerate  the  asymmetry  that  I see.  I thought  I feltthe  same  way at  the  last  meeting and, in reviewing  the  transcript  forthat meeting,  I  found that  that  is  what  I did  say then.  Between thatmeeting and this  meeting,  the  annual  growth rates  in  the  Greenbook forthe  second and  third quarters  of  1995  were both written down by  anaverage  of  1/2  percentage point  and my prediction of  what will  happenbetween now and  the next  Greenbook  is  a  further  reduction  of  thatorder of magnitude.  It  has  occurred  to  me that  I could probably makemoney by  forecasting  a bigger  slowdown when  the  Greenbook  isforecasting a slowdown,  and  forecasting a bigger  acceleration when  theGreenbook  is  forecasting  an  acceleration.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  is  true of  anyone's  forecast!

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That was  the  next  sentence  out  of  my mouth![Laughter]  If  it  is  not true  of  the  Greenbook,  it  is  an  exception  tothe  rule.  There are  a number of  reasons  for  this  tendency  offorecasts  to  underestimate changes.  I mentioned this  last  time,  and  Iam not  going  to  go  into  any detail here,  but  a lot  of  those reasonscould be  summarized by saying  that  people  underestimate multiplier-accelerator  interactions.  Janet  Yellen mentioned several  suchinstances.  As  I look  across  the  components,  I can  find  an  explanationhaving  to  do  with consumption,  that  is,  with  saving  rates,  withinvestment  accelerators,  with government  spending, with  fiscal  policy--about  which I will  have  one minute's  worth to  say  in a moment--andwith net  exports as  well.  It  also  has  to  do with  the  incredible5/23/95-29-smoothness of  the  inventory cycle  in  the  Greenbook,  something that  hasnot been remarked  about.  Basically, the  level  of  inventory investmentin  the Greenbook simply  converges  to what  is  essentially a  steadystate without  ever overshooting.  That  would be  a  first  if  it  shouldhappen.  So,  I think  the multiplier-accelerator  interaction is  likelyto  be underestimated  in the  forecast,  not by  a huge  amount, butsomewhat.As  we  discussed yesterday around the  Board table,  thetreatment  of  the Mexico  shock as  a one-quarter  event  is  extremelyoptimistic,  as  I see  it.  I think  that Mexico will  be  a drag on  ourexports  for  longer than  is  built  into  this  forecast.  Finally, echoingwhat  Governor Lindsey  just  said, though not  quite as  strongly andcertainly not  in  as much  detail,  I now think  that  the  likelihood isfor  a bigger  fiscal  contraction  than  is  built  into  the Greenbookforecast.  I was  extremely  skeptical  about this  for a  long time.  Butwith  the passage  of  the  budget  resolutions  in both houses  of  Congressand, as  Larry said, with  the  hits  having been  taken and with theRepublican  leadership very, very committed--you can either put  this  ashaving dug  themselves  into  a big hole  or put  themselves  on  a niceplatform--I  think the prospects  for  a bigger  fiscal  contraction aremuch more likely  than they were  a few months  ago.  I want  to  note  thatwe  are not  talking about  something that  is  very  far  into  the  future.This  fiscal  contraction starts  late  this  year.  On  the other hand, ashas been  remarked, what has  already happened  to  the bond market,  thestock market,  and the  exchange  rate  is  going  to  be supporting  theeconomy later  in  the year.  In my view, this  does  not  add up  to  acrash  landing by any means.  But  I think it  will  not be quite  as  softas  in  the Greenbook.  I would say  it  is  likely  to  be  a bumpy landingbut not bumpy enough  to  break the  landing gear.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With that,  we will  go  to  coffee.

COFFEE  BREAK

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Don,  is  the  price  index that  Taylor  usesthe  fixed weight  or the  implicit deflator?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I  think it  is  the  implicit  deflator.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So,  when  the  GDP  figures  are  revised,his  normative  funds  rate will  go up?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I would suppose  so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You don't know what  the  dimension ofthat  is,  do  you?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  If  you  use  the  implicit  deflator  in  his  rule,  youcome  out with a  federal  funds  rate  around 4-1/4  percent  now.  If  youuse  the  CPI  rather  than  the  implicit  deflator, you are  around  5-3/4percent.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes,  it  is  closer  to  6.5/23/95-30-

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  But  using  the CPI  in  the  equation  for  earlieryears  does  not  track Committee  actions  as  well  as  using  the deflator.In particular, by persisting  at  a higher  level  through  the  1991-1993period, the CPI  predicts a much higher  federal  funds  rate  than  theCommittee  actually adopted.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The crucial  question  that you raise  isthat  of  using his  equation to  capture what we were  deciding  over  thelast  eight  years,  and  I suggest  to  you  that  that  may be a  littlefallacious  in  the  sense  that  it  can be misspecified by the  choice  ofvariables.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Just  an  elementary observation:  It  does notmake  a lot  of  sense  to  take  the  same equation with  the  same  interceptand the  same  coefficients  and  then change  the right  hand variable  tosee how  it  does.  If  you had used a different  inflation  index over  theeight years,  you would have  had a different  rule.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  exactly right.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Except  that,  Governor Blinder,  this  rule  was notestimated.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  He  just  did  something that  seemed to  make  senseand  things  fell  out.  But  you are  right,  if  you were  to  estimate it,obviously  it  would come  out  somewhat  differently.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  For both problems.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any other  questions?  If  not,  I don'thave much  to  add  to what  has been  said  in recent meetings  because,  infact,  the  economy  is  moving pretty much  as  expected.  If  you make  theadjustment  that  Governor Blinder  requires,  namely  that  forecasts  arealways  a moving average  of  actual  events  and they  smooth out  the  realworld, that  is  one of  the  reasons  I recall  saying  back  in our  latehalf was  going  to  surprise us  on  the down  side.  All  I was  doing wasusing the  Blinder  rule  and it  always works.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  It  never  tells  you which quarter,  though![Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  it  never  is  very helpful  in  thatsense.  I think we have  to  look at  this  particular  outlook in  terms  ofwhat  is  engendering  the  softening.  That  softening  is  very clearly  theresult  of  an  inventory backup,  which could be a  little  stronger  thanwe may expect.  I  think manufacturing may have a  few more  months,forecast.  The C&I  loan  figures  may be  pointing  to  a slowdown, but  Isuspect  that  we are  going  to  find  that  the  inventory reduction hasbeen slower  than we  were expecting  and  that  a goodly part  of  that  wasan unintended inventory backup.  That means  that  people have not yetcome  to  grips with  the  squeeze  down  to  a  significantly lower rate  ofinventory  investment.  As  a consequence,  I suspect  that  the  thirdquarter  is  going  to  be  softer  than  is  projected  in the  Greenbook.Were  it  not  for  the  fact  that  inventory  levels,  no  matter how we5/23/95-31-measure  them,  remain quite low,  I would say the  concern  that  a numberof  you  have  expressed with respect  to  the potential  for  reducedinventory investment working  its way through  the  income  structure  andinducing a weaker consumption pattern  in a historically typical  waywould be  something  that  we  ought  to  be concerned  about.  But no  matterhow we  look  at  the numbers,  the  levels just  remain  too  low  for  theinventory  sector  to be  a matter  of  grave concern.  And because  othersectors  of  the  economy  such as  capital  goods and exports,  and  I mightadd homebuilding, are  showing  signs  of  sustainability, we don't  havethe  conditions  that  would  induce  the underlying  system  to  crack  atthis  particular  stage.The  reason  I asked Mike  Prell  earlier about  the  size  of  thegap between orders  and shipments  is  that  I suspect  that we  are goingto  see  new orders  coming  down  in capital  goods markets.  The  onlyquestion  is  whether  they will drop  far  enough  to breach  the  shipmentslevel  and turn unfilled  orders  down.  I think  that  is  a mixed  call  atthis  stage, but  because  there  is  so  much of a gap  there, we haveleeway  for  fairly significant  short-term weakening.  I must say  that  Idon't  expect all  that  much weakening in  the  expansion,  largely becausethe  profit picture  still  looks  increasingly supportive.  That  is,  asthe  Greenbook  indicates,  the  earnings  surprises  on  the  up  side  arestill  2  to  1--profits  are  coming  in  more  favorably twice  as  often asunfavorably.  The  first-quarter profit  numbers  that  were published arejust  gangbusters and profit margins  are  still  rising.  This  is  reallyquite extraordinary, given  the  extent  of  the  slowdown  that  is  involvedhere.  What  history tells  us  is  that  we  just  don't  get  a capital  goodscontraction  in  the  context  of rising  profit  margins,  rising  stockprices,  and long-term  interest  rates  that  tend  to be  falling.  Thatbusiness  cycle  is  by no means  dead, but  it  just  does  not make anysense  in  an  historical  context  to  presume  that we will  be  looking  atsignificantly weaker  capital  spending.  Certainly, nonresidentialbuilding continues  to  strengthen and we  are  getting,  as  many of youhave  indicated, a gradual,  underlying healing of  that  problem.Indeed,  the  issue  may be more what  Governor Lindsey  is  concernedabout:  There may be too much nonresidential  construction going onalready or  at  least  showing  signs  of  being  overdone,  and  I must  say Ihave  a certain  sympathy  for  that  kind of  concern.We did  get  a  surprising statistic  from  the mortgage bankerslast week.  I don't know whether  to  believe  it  or not,  but  the weeklyseasonally adjusted figure  on home purchases  as  reported by themortgage bankers  spiked  sharply upward, and  it  does  not  look  like  aseasonal  adjustment problem because  the unadjusted number was  thehighest  that  we  have  seen  in  a very  long  time.  Moreover, all  thequalitative  evidence--the  traffic,  the  intentions  to  buy, the  consumerconfidence  elements  associated with housing--is  in the  direction  of  arise  in housing  activity.  The  reason starts  are  weak is  that we  havea very heavy overhang  of  unsold homes  through which  the market  has  towork its  way.  The underlying  quality of  this  market  is  pretty  sound.In  sum,  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  cumulative  decline  in  theeconomy.  We  have  a very  odd problem  in  the  published  inventory data,but  we  also have  one  in  the  unpublished data  that  involves  stockadjustment  inventories.  In  the  housing  industry inventories  of  unsoldhomes  will  continue  to  hold  activity down.  In  the  motor vehicles  areaI think,  as  President Moskow  indicated, that  the  May data  on  sales5/23/95-32-look  somewhat  stronger at  this  stage  than  those  for April,  although byno  means  as  strong as  they have been.  Nor, with  all  the weakness  thatwe are  seeing, do  the  initial  claims  for unemployment  insurancesuggest  that  this  economy is  in a continuous weakening phase.  Theevidence does  suggest  that  there  are going to  be  a lot more  surpriseson the  down side  in  the very short  run  than we may be  prepared for.The debt  issue  that  Governor Lindsey  raises  is  an  interestingone,  and  I would only respond by suggesting  that part of  the problemwith this  big  increase  in  installment  credit,  which really isoutsized,  is  a  significant displacement  coming from  the mortgageindirect  financing  for  consumer durables  has come  from the  turnover ofexisting homes.  That  turnover has  induced large  realized capitalgains  that  have been  financed  in the  mortgage market.  Those  funds  aregoing disproportionately into  the  financing  of  consumer durables.  Theslowness  of  the mortgage market  in relation  to  the  level  of  existinghome  sales  is  suggestive of  the  fact  that  less  of  that  is  going  on,and it  may be  that--l-1/2 billion  credit  card solicitations--is  thatwhat  you  said?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  1.2  billion in  the  first  quarter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  that  an  official  figure?  Where didyou get  the  number?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  The  bankers  gave  it  to  me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No  kidding!  That  is  scary!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It  is  scary!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Every dog  and  cat  and moose  has  a  creditcard!  I think  that  part of  the problem  is  merely a shift  in  the  formof  financing, but  I don't  think we  can  look  at  those  figures  withoutsome  concern.  I do  agree  that  the  easing  of  credit  terms  is  apotential problem down  the  road.  I say  that  even  though,  according  tothe  bankers,  credit  terms are  still  tighter  than  they were  in  the late1980s;  but  that  is  scarcely the  standard  that  one  should employ, as  Ithink  one  of  our  colleagues  indicated  the  other day.I would  say that  there  is  a bigger problem down  the  roadrelated  to  all  of  this.  If  in  fact  the  economy  tracks  the Greenbookforecast,  it  is  inconceivable  in my judgment  that  it  will  continuedoing  so  for  an  extended period.  That  is  because  if  this  happens,  thestock market  is  going to  go  straight  up and  then  straight  down.  Andon  the down  side  there  will be  an awful  lot  of  demand  implosion.  So,if  this  economy works  as  well  as  the  Greenbook suggests,  the  reallyserious  problem that  we will  have  in  setting monetary policy, which weare  going  to  have  to  question ourselves  on, will be how we  shouldrespond  to  asset price  bubbles.  We  know how to  respond to  productprice  inflation and  the  instability  that  is  associated with  that.  Youthat  an  asset price bubble  was  building up.  Little  did we know thatit  was  much bigger  than we  had  imagined  and that  it was  more  in bondsthan in  stocks.  In  retrospect,  it  was  terribly  fortunate  that  thatbubble  got  pricked at  the appropriate  time.  I am not  sure  that  onecan  make a  forecast  that  is  as  stable  as  the  one  in  the  Greenbook,5/23/95-33-because  implicit  in such  a  forecast,  given human  nature, are  actionsthat  will probably upset  it  and  that  concerns  me.So,  one  of  the  reasons why  the  real  world is  not  very  apt  tolook  like  the  Greenbook  is  that  the  way the  real  world works  is  notlike  "that" but  more  something like  "this."  [Secretary's  note:  TheChairman made a hand gesture  indicating  a smooth path when he  said"that" and an  uneven path when he  said  "this."]  The only problem isthat we  don't know what  "this"  is  until  after  the  fact.  So,  allforecasters can do  is  to  draw straight  lines  through things.  Thedisequilibrium that  is  implicit  in  this  forecast  is  an  asset  pricebubble,  and I am not  sure  at  this  stage  that  we know how  or by whatmeans  we ought  to  be responding to  that,  and whether we  dare.  Thereis  always  the  question, if  we make a preemptive  strike  against anasset bubble,  of  whether we  could blow the  economy out  of  the water  inthe  process.  So,  it  is  a slightly nervous-making type  of  situation.I almost hope  that  the  economy will be  a little  less  tranquil,buoyant,  and pleasant because  the  end result  of  that  is  not  terriblyhelpful.On  the product  price  inflation side,  I think what we  arelooking  at  here  is  strictly the  expected  slowdown  in productivity thatoccurs  as  a consequence  of  fixed  costs  not being  spread over  theaggregate volumes  that  we  have  seen.  As  unit  labor  costs  riseaccordingly, we  will  be  looking  inevitably at  the beginning  of  aprices  from accelerating modestly.  However,  that  is  a cyclicalphenomenon  and not  one  that  I would be  terribly concerned about.  I amcertainly not as  concerned  about  that  as  I would be  about  an  assetprice  bubble, which is  down  the  road, granted, but  still  something  tobe  concerned  about.Fortunately, as  I see  it  in  the  short  run, none  of  this  isrelevant!  [Laughter]  We can,  as  I see  it,  just  do  "B" symmetric  andwait until  the next  meeting.  I think  it  is  very unlikely that  thenext  meeting is  going  to  be  one  where we are  going  to  be  confrontedwith an  economic  expansion  that  is  picking up, because my  suspicionis--I  don't  know whether  I'd pick the  specific  timing  that  GovernorBlinder  did--that  the  rate  of  expansion  is  going  to be  shading  down alittle  in  the period immediately ahead.  But  I would not  expect  theslowing  to  be  enough  to  undercut  the  fairly  solid underlying  status  ofthis  recovery  for a while,  perhaps  a good while yet.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman,  I agree  with yourrecommendation  for  "B" symmetric.  I think  that  the  last  time we were,somewhat  appropriately, more  concerned about  inflation  than we  need benow,  even though  I  think we  must  stay alert.  And therefore  the  "B"symmetric  resolution  is  the  appropriate  one.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I,  too,  am  in  agreement  with your proposal,Mr.  Chairman.  There are  a couple of  things  that  I think we need  to  beconcerned  about.  First, where  are the  uncertainties?  You  have  talkeda bit  about  that.  And secondly, what  are  the  costs  of being  wrong ineither  direction even  if  the  uncertainties  are  more or  less  balanced?At  this  point,  I think the  risks  are  reasonably balanced.  Butinflation could be  higher  than  the  Greenbook projects,  and my own5/23/95-34-assessment  is  that  the  costs  of  being  wrong on  that  side are a  littlehigher than  the  costs  of  being wrong on  the  other side.  You  indicatedthat  you  are  inclined  to  the view  that  the  uptick  in  inflation  iscyclical;  other people have  mentioned that  as well.  I am  concernedabout  the possibility  that  it  is  not necessarily all  cyclical.  If  itisn't--and the Greenbook has built  in  an  estimated  1/2  point  increasein  the  core CPI  rate  in  1996  versus  1994--even recognizing  that  1994was pretty  low,  I keep  asking myself  whether we  should be  satisfiedwith that  and whether that  kind of  outcome  is  something to  be  sanguineabout going  forward.  Are we  certain  enough that  this  is  cyclical  andnot  some  uptick in  the  trend,  or  is  it  potentially an uptick  in  thetrend if  in  fact we are  experiencing a pause  rather  than a morepermanent  downturn in  the growth  of  demand?  So,  I agree with yourcomments;  I agree with your proposal.  I think  I am just  a  littlemore nervous  about  the  inflation prospects.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The way I put  it  is  that  I am morenervous about  the  asset bubble  than  I am about product prices.  Thatis  not  to  say  that  I would disagree with you.  There may be more  thana cyclical  element  in here  that  we won't  know about  until  after  thefact.  I think most  of  it--

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Is  cyclical.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  cyclical,  but  such  inflation  is  notacceptable as  far  as  I am concerned.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I think  the  risks  are  somewhat  unbalanced to  thedown  side,  and I think  the  recent performance  of  the  economy wouldargue  for  some  easing  today, but  the markets  have  already done  that,both interest  rates  and  the  exchange  market.  I think  they already  areproviding  some  support  for  the  economy.  I agree with yourrecommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I certainly  agree with your  recommendation,Mr.  Chairman.  When  I made my  economic  statement,  I pointed  out  thatwe  face  two  risks  currently--a continuing  longer-term  inflation  riskbut  also a not  inconsequential  possibility that  the  current weaknessin  the economy may  cumulate.  If  the  latter  situation were  in  fact  tomaterialize--again that  is  not what  I think  is  going  to  happen but,who  knows,  it  certainly could in  the months  ahead--it would be  verynice  for us  to  be  in  a position  to  react  to  that  quickly and promptly.That  would be  a preemptive move  against  recession which would be  theflip  side  of  the preemptive move we made  against  inflation,  I thinkwith  some  success,  last  year.  The  problem, of  course,  is  credibility.If  we were  to  take  an action  that  was  in  any way seen  as an  aggressiveeasing move,  that  could do great  damage  to  the  credibility  that  wehave  built up  over  a long period of  time  at  some  cost.  That  is  why Ithink  it  would be  very nice  if  we  could  find  some  longer-term nominalanchor  for monetary policy in order  to  impress  our  longer-termstrategic goal  more  firmly  in  the public mind.  We had a discussion  ofthis  a couple  of  meetings  ago.  At  that  time  I said that  I thought  itwould be nice  if  we  were  to make  an  explicit  announcement  that  we wereadopting the  language  of  the Neal  Amendment  as  our  longer-termobjective.  I am less  concerned,  though, about what  the  form of  theanchor would be  than  that  we  do  something  to  tie  that  down precisely5/23/95-35-so  that  we  can deal  with an  increase in  the downside  risk--should thatmaterialize--flexibly  and effectively without  giving up  all  of  thegains  we  have made  on  the  credibility side  in  recent years.  In anycase,  I would hope  that  when we  get  to  the July meeting and we  haveour usual  discussion of  longer-term goals, we  might  give  that  pointsome  attention.

MR. BOEHNE.  I support  "B" symmetric.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  your recommendation.  Iagree  that  in  the  short  term  the  risks  seem reasonably well balanced,although  I share  the  same views  as  President Minehan  about emphasizingthe possibility  that  inflation may be  a  little higher  than ourforecast  in  the  shorter  term.  I would suggest,  however,  that  if  we  infact  are  somewhat agreed about  the  direction that  we would  like to  seethe rate  of  inflation go  in  the  longer  term, it  will  make us  rathercautious  in moving  toward  lower  rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think we  ought to  be  fairlyhappy with the  course  of monetary policy  over  the  last  year  and theresults  that  it  has  achieved  in  the  economy.  There  obviously  areuncertainties  surrounding  the  forecast.  The concerns  that  you pointto  with respect  to  the  asset price  bubble  are  real,  but  I think thatthose  are down  the  road as  you have  indicated.  We  have  the  luxury  fora change  of  sitting  back and  letting events  unfold a  little  longerbefore we have  to  make a move.  So,  I support  your recommendation of  a"B" symmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  "B" symmetric  as  well.I am  concerned about  the  asset bubble problem you mentioned.  I thinkit  is  a  real  one  down  the  road.  We may  see  some  signs  of  an  increasein  the  inflation rate  in  coming months,  but  at  this  point  it  appearsthat  that  increase will be  transitory.  There  is  some  danger  of  givingup ground  on our  progress  toward price  stability,  so  I think  itclearly would be  inappropriate  to  respond too hastily  to  any  signs  ofweakening in  real  activity.  But  in  light  of  the  evenly balanced  risksthat  I see  at  this  point,  the  current  stance of  monetary policy  isappropriate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.5/23/95-36-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I agree  with  "B" symmetric.  I dohave  concerns,  as  I mentioned earlier,  that  the  inflation may be morethan  cyclical,  and I agree  that  it  is  wise  to  wait and  see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I,  too,  agree  with  "B" symmetric.  The onlycomment  I would add  is  that when  I submitted my Humphrey-Hawkinsnumbers  earlier  this  year,  I was  relatively negative  about  theinflation outlook, at  least  for  this  year.  Unfortunately, nothing hashappened to  change my view about  that.  On  the  other  hand, looking atall  the  incoming  information on  the  economy,  I am marginally moreconfident  that  this may  turn out  to  be  a temporary  acceleration  in  thecore CPI,  and  I don't  see any  reason  to  take  action at  this  juncture.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Mr. Chairman, I  support your proposal  for  "B"symmetric.  I think that  an unchanged  funds  rate  is  warranted giventhe  Greenbook  forecast with risks  roughly balanced.

MR.  JORDAN.  I agree with  no change  at  this  meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I favor  "B" symmetric  as  well, Alan.  I thinkour  focus  has  to  be  on pursuing  a policy  that  contains  currentinflationary pressures  and is  aimed at  making progress  toward  longer-term price  stability.  I am not,  as  you know,  a great  fan of  short-runfine-tuning.  I think we  are  seeing  a  slowdown from  a nonsustainablerate  of  growth,  and we should  not be  trying  to  fine-tune  in  thosecircumstances.  We may have a moderately  tight monetary policy, butthat  is  appropriate  in  view of  the  tremendous  stimulus  that  took placein  1991  through 1993.  The other  comment  I would make,  and we heardsome  commentary on  this  issue  today,  is  that  any reaction  to  fiscalpolicy restraint,  certainly  any  reaction to  the prospect  of  it,  isvery dangerous.  Even  if  we do  get  some  fiscal  restraint,  I wouldargue  that  the best  thing monetary policy  can do  is  to  provide  astable price backdrop  against  which the  real  adjustments  that  need totake place  in  that  event  can occur most  effectively.

MR. LINDSEY.  I support  your proposal,  Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would you  read the  directive.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The directive  is  on page  15  of  the  Bluebook:"In  the  implementation of  policy for  the  immediate  future,  theCommittee  seeks  to  maintain  the  existing degree  of  pressure  on reservepositions.  In  the  context  of  the  Committee's  long-run objectives  for5/23/95-37-price  stability and sustainable  economic  growth,  and giving  carefulconsideration  to  economic,  financial, and monetary developments,somewhat  greater reserve  restraint  or  somewhat  lesser reserverestraint would be  acceptable  in  the  intermeeting period.  Thecontemplated reserve  conditions  are  expected  to  be  consistent withmoderate  growth  in M2  and M3  over  coming months."
