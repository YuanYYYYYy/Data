CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  A housekeeping  item:  We  are  releasing the minutes  ofthe November meeting  tomorrow,  I believe.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  Tomorrow  at  2:00 p.m.,  yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  They are  being released earlier than is our usualpractice partly  because of Christmas and partly because of coordination  with  the other centralbanks  on  the swap issue  that we  have discussed  previously.  Would somebody like to move  theminutes of the November  17  meeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Peter.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring  to thefour pages of colored charts  you should find in front  of you.  1/  Beginningon the first page with  the deposit  rates,  you can  see by the red lines in thetop panel  that the U.S. forward  rates are  little changed since  your lastmeeting.  But it is worth  noting that both the 3-month  and the 9-monthforward rates  continue to  trade below the current  3-month deposit  rate,suggesting some expectation  of an ease coming in the first half of next  year,but  without much  specificity  to it.  The two forward  rates are  trading on topof one  another,  so it does  not look  as  if they imply  a series of easings,  butsome  further easing seems to  be priced in  here.Looking  at  the German  forward rates,  you can  see that those ratespartially anticipated,  in late November  and into early December, thelittle lower  after that.  Also, the forward rates  in  Germany are  trading belowthe  current  3-month rate, suggesting  again  some expectation  of an  easing inthe coming  year.  You can't see it in this chart, but let me note that there isvery little evidence  of greater year-end  pressure  this  year than  last year inGerman funding markets.  It does  seem to  be worth noting, given  thecoming of the  euro that the  markets do not seem to have  priced in  anyextraordinary  year-end  effect.  That  is also  in contrast to  the pronouncedyear-end effect  we are  seeing already  for the year  after next--for the  year1/ Copies of the charts used by Mr. Fisher are  appended to the transcript.12/22/982000.  So there's not much special  pressure in German  funding  marketssurrounding  the  anticipation of the euro.In  the bottom panel  showing the Japanese rates,  you can  see that on thisscale, which  is comparable  to  the top two panels, the  deposit rates show  abarely  detectable rise.  But, as  small  as it is  here on this chart, by Japanesestandards  this really is noticeable.  Let me  say that I think we have  found toomany,  rather than too few, explanations  for this gentle backing up inJapanese  money market  rates:  whether it's that the economy is  expected  tobottom out in the first half of the year or that the yields  on Japanesegovernment  bonds  (JGBs)  are backing  up, as I will get to in a moment, orthat the  Bank of Japan is not being quite so generous  in its provision ofreserves.  None  of the explanations  is entirely  satisfactory to me, but thereclearly has been  a gradual  backup in Japanese  money market rates.Turning to the  second page,  the three panels  give something of a reviewof the last six months in  financial markets.  In the top panel,  we have majorst. It shows  marks per dollar,exchange  rate pairs indexed to  100  as of July  1yen per mark, and yen per dollar,  and their percentage  change  over the lastsix months.In the middle panel  are  the three major equity indices, also  indexed toline  which  depicts the JGB  yield; I  will come  back to that shortly.  But theother three  colored lines in that bottom  panel show  various  spreads  as theyhave  traded from July to the present.My point in bringing these three panels together is to show  that therewere really two  very distinct episodes  of delevering,  which  occurredroughly  in the weeks  following the Committee's  August and  Septembermeetings.  There has been  a third more modest delevering event in the lastfew weeks  associated with the year-end.  The very pronounced  decline  inboth the mark and the dollar against the yen  seen in the top panel  coincidedwith the  significant turmoil in early October.  You can see in  the bottompanel  that the three  triangles  point to the peak  spreads reached  also early inIn the middle panel  you can see where equity markets,  at least  inGermany and Japan, reached their nadirs  during that period, and the  Dowalmost reached its nadir  and began coming  back.More  recently, there  has been  some  gradual decline in the dollar againstthe yen,  but it has been relatively muted, more or less associated  withyear-end  thinness,  with some reversal  of that move in the  last day or so.Also in the bottom panel  you can see that  swap spreads  and theon-the-run/off-the-run  spread have backed up a little.  I would emphasizethe thinness  of markets  rather than anything  else here.  But in the  middlepanel  you can see the  somewhat manic  behavior of our equity markets.  It12/22/98seems to me rather pronounced and in contrast  to the events in the  otherFocusing now  on the red line in the  bottom panel,  which depicts  thebenchmark Japanese  government bond yield, in the last few days--and  sinceyour last meeting  in fact--there has  been an extraordinary  backup in  thisyield.  The bond was trading  at a yield of around  80 basis points  at the timeof your last meeting  or just before.  It traded  at 150 basis  points yesterday.It was  off a further 40 basis points  earlier today, or up  to  190.  It has comeback a little from that level,  having traded  the limit down  today both  in theTokyo  and London futures  markets,  and it is now at about  180 basis  points.The Japanese  government  first  began leaking and then yesterdayannounced its borrowing  plans for the coming  year,  which in their forecastwill amount  to roughly a 65  percent increase  in the amount  of Japanesegovernment  bonds  to be absorbed by the  public portfolio--that is, by privatesector demand.  The bond market has begun  to price this  in.Back in  September Japanese  banks  were given  a choice  by the Ministryof Finance  either to treat their bonds on  a mark-to-market  or on an originalcost basis.  Most of the  banks, virtually all,  elected to do it on an  originalcost basis.  In my view, that simply is going  to delay the  day of reckoningas yields back up, given that the  holdings of JGBs on the  balance sheets ofall kinds of financial  intermediaries  are rather significant  as  a creditsubstitute.  As the yields  back up  and approach  the  average cost  of any oneinstitution's  JGBs, that institution  will  have an  extraordinary  incentive tosell out its positions.  That already seems to be  under way and is providingsomething of a continuing accelerator for the backup in Japanesegovernment  bonds.  Given the extraordinary  scope of this backup in just acouple  of days, I think it is reasonable  that the U.S. and European  bondthese  losses  are off-loading  some of their holdings of U.S.  and other fixed-income instruments.Now,  all this is in  anticipation of the rather exciting  year  Japanesegovernment  bond markets  are  going to have in  1999, so we have that tolook forward  to.  We in all likelihood have the specter, in my humbleopinion, of the  Ministry of Finance trying to change the accounting rulesagain  at the end  of the fiscal year if these losses become  too extreme  oninsurance company and bank balance  sheets.Turning  to domestic operations  on the next page,  the funds market hasbeen a little less  stable than normal, but there has been  some improvementover the last intermeeting period  in terms  of some reduction in  the extremevolatility.  This chart is similar to  the one I presented  at your last meeting.On the  vertical  axis are the basis points contained within  one standard12/22/98deviation of the daily trading range,  and on the horizontal axis is the basispoint variation of the daily effective  rate from the target.  The  hollow dotsrepresent  observations  in the  intermeeting  period between  your Septemberand November  meetings.  The filled in dots represent days  since  your lastmeeting.  And as I did last time, I have summarized  in the lower left-handbox the results, roughly  speaking, against the benchmark  period of the prioryear before  August.As you can  see, while  we had fewer days  with  very  low volatility,where trading was  in a tight range around  the expected rate,  we had roughlythe  same number of days within the  50 percent  box.  Without counting  thedots, let me point out  a different  way of looking  at this.  In  the September-to-November period,  fully 1/3  of the days  observed had a standard deviationof greater than  .4, whereas  in the more recent period only  1/6 of the dayshad a standard  deviation  of more than  .4.  So we haven't come  to the pointof a quiet market,  but  we  have  reduced some of the extreme  volatility.  Ithink this has been  caused by a  reduction  in credit  concerns  and  somegreater access to  term funding markets,  which have  opened up to a widernumber of participants.  Also,  early  in this intermeeting  period we leanedrather  heavily  against  firmness,  being quite  generous  in our reserve-supplying operations,  and when  we began to take that away from theassumed, perhaps,  that we were  being more  generous  than  we in fact were.On  the last page I have  shown the comparable  data for the same periodexactly  one  year ago.  I would note that the red dots represent  the days  withhigh payment flows--tax  payment dates,  bond  settlement dates, ormaintenance  period  settlement  dates.  They  are  really the days when  onewould expect  to  see the higher volatility,  and that is what  we see here.  Inthe  1997 period the  dots on  normal  days  are  much more  densely clusteredthan in  the comparable  period this year, where we  see a mix of blue  and reddots  at the higher volatilities,  indicating  the higher volatility  we still  arefacing.  But I think that has  calmed down somewhat.Let  me note  that we did conduct  a  pass to purchase indexed  securitiesand we also  undertook three  longer-term repo operations.  These elicitedrelatively little market  reaction  and went  much  as I had hoped.  We alreadyhave $12  billion in repos on the  books  for the turn of the  year, which willhelp us unwind automatically  as reserve  needs  diminish  after the  peakyear-end  period.Mr. Chairman,  we  had no foreign  exchange intervention  operationsduring the period.  We have completed  the renewal  of our swaparrangements  with  our Mexican  and Canadian  colleagues,  but all our otherswap  arrangements  have lapsed.  I  will need  two votes,  however.  I havecirculated to the Committee  a request  to add the euro to the currencies  in12/22/98 5which  we are  authorized  to operate.  I would propose to come back to youat a meeting  early in the new year to discuss removing the  legacycurrencies.  But for the moment  I thought we  would leave those  alone.  So, Iam seeking a  vote to add  the euro to the  foreign currency  authorization.  Iwill also need ratification  of our domestic  operations.  I would be  happy toanswer any questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me  go back  to the  issue that you mentioned withrespect to the incentives of Japanese  banks to  sell their JGBs.  The banks are carrying them atbook  and they are engendering  very large capital  losses.  Those losses are  not being  chargedagainst capital,  but would be if the  JGBs were  sold before maturity.  I didn't quite get the pointthat you were  making.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  My understanding  is  that once the price  of the JGBs declines below  thecost at which  they were purchased,  the banks will  have to recognize  a loss.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is it cost or market or both?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  It is cost  or market, whichever  they chose.  They were given  a choice.Virtually all chose cost.  I may be wrong, but I went over this  with the Ministry  of Financerepresentative  in New  York just yesterday,  and my understanding  is that  once the market pricereaches  cost, the banks  will then have  to recognize  a  loss.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is the old-fashioned  market  or cost basis if it'sbelow market.  Once they reach cost, it becomes  a  loss.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That's right.  But I think  the way they will  view  this is not on abond-for-bond basis.  They will  look at the average cost of their JGB portfolio.  And as thebreakeven  point is pierced.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Why?  I  can see it on a bond-by-bond  basis.  They mayhave a  different way of keeping their books.  We do it bond-by-bond;  you are saying they do not.12/22/98

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I think there  may be a distinction.  Theaccounting probably is bond-by-bond.  But if you  are managing the portfolio,  you are going tosay:  "It is approaching  breakeven  so I better  get rid  of it."  I think the accounting  would be theway  you described,  but the managerial  approach  would be to bunch these securities.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It is poor management if I  understand  what they aretrying to do, which is  to hide their  losses.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  would it surprise  you  if that were--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I won't comment on that!  On  a  seemingly relatedsubject, I noticed that in the bottom graph  on page  2  you show  the U.S.  10-year swap  spread overTreasuries,  which  is somewhat more than  80 basis  points.  In Britain it is also about the sameorder  of magnitude.  On the continent,  as I recall,  it is about 30 basis points.  Does this reflect apresumption  in the market that  there is more  sovereign backing  of commercial  bank liabilities  onthe  continent than either here or in Britain?  If that is not the answer,  why is  there  such asignificant  difference in spreads?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I have  not found an acceptable  explanation  of that myself.  It issomething I have tried  to follow.  So my first response  is that I see  it as a bit of a mystery.  Ithink it's especially  a mystery if you realize  that these swap  spreads,  as most of us measure  them,are from a common  panel  of major international  banks.  So the difference in  spreads  should be acredit issue, but it is hard to pull that out when  one is looking at a  common  panel of globalplayers  who  are the ones  we look to for quotes  on these  swap  spreads.  That  mean  that issomehow embedded  in--I don't even  know how  to express  it.  No term comes to mind to  expressthis; I'm at a loss.12/22/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There  has to be  an answer because  somebody is bidding30 basis  points for one  and 80 basis points for another, which suggests  that they see  a differenceand  are  doing it for a reason.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  There  are  some in the market  who think that European  central  banksare  active  in this market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is a potential  explanation.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  that  would be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That goes to the sovereign  credit  issue.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  It  is coming in  through  the demand side rather  than the supply  side, ifyou  will.  But I have  not interrogated  my foreign  central  bank counterparts  enough  to determinethis.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If you have  a chance,  could you track it down?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Yes,  I may be  able to do so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The only reason I raise the issue  is that it may be  tellingus  something about the  issue of subsidization  in the  system, which  is a useful  insight if proven.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes, we  will  try to look into that further.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further questions?

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Is this the appropriate  time  to bring  up the issue of indexed  bonds  thatwe talked  about last time?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I happened to be on the morning call  when the Desk first boughtindexed bonds,  and there was  a very  large reaction  in the marketplace.  It seems  to me that thisexperience  raises the  question  that I brought up before,  about whether we should be buying12/22/98 8indexed bonds for the FOMC portfolio.  I am still opposed to it.  In my view it produced  asubstantial change  in the yields  when we  went in that  day.  I think our operations  in this marketare going to muddy the interpretation  of the information  we can get from the market.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  You saw a rather significant  1-hour reaction, President Poole.  I thinkthe  1-day and 3-day and 3-week reaction  was rather muted.  So,  my first point is that trying  tomeasure  this on a minute-by-minute  basis involves  working with  too short a  time horizon.  Mysecond  point is that I really  do not understand  the logic of your position.  We are activeoccasionally  in purchasing securities  on the other side of this spread whose  purity you careabout; we purchase  30-year and 10-year and 5-year nominal  bonds.  If what you care  about  is theclarity of the spread,  the logical position is  that we should operate either on  both sides of thatspread or on neither.  I  do not see  the logic  in  suggesting that  we should operate  on only one sideof the spread.  I view the market reaction  to which  you refer as a  short-term  reaction to our firstpurchases of these securities.  I would  expect an abrupt reaction  on the first day  we operate inany new area  of the market.  But I think it largely disappeared  and was very  hard to find onsubsequent days.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  On  the first day--not just the first hour, but the first day--the  longestindexed  bond, which  I believe  is the one that we purchased,  was up  16/32.  The neighboringbonds  were  down  12/32,  14/32,  19/32,  and  20/32.  In the  general market that particular day thenon-indexed  conventional  bonds  also were  dropping in price.  As  I understand the  process, whenthe Desk is going  to buy  securities in the secondary market for the System portfolio,  it asks forpropositions from the market.  And it is your standard practice to look for the propositions  thatare attractively priced  from our perspective,  and that means the  ones  that are  a little out of line  onthe general  yield curve.  Would that be a correct interpretation  of what  you do?12/22/98

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  That is  one thing we look at; it is  not the only thing.  We  are  alsolooking at our holdings  of securities  and trying to keep a balanced portfolio  across the wholeyield curve.  That is really the  first order of importance.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  Okay.  I can understand  picking  up some that  are trading  at a peculiarprice relative to  the adjacent issues, but you can't make that decision  on the indexed bondwithout taking a view  as  to what  the relationship between  the  indexed bond and the conventionalbond  would be.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No, I disagree  with  you completely  on  that.  That  is precisely why Iwanted to do a TIPS-only pass:  So the only relative  value  statement we would be making  wouldbe vis-a-vis other TIPS issues.  Thus, when we purchased TIPS  I would make a judgment as tothe rough order of magnitude,  how many hundreds  of millions  should be purchased.  Then thetraders'  judgments  are restricted to making a relative value  choice across  the range  of TIPSpropositions they are  given.  That's precisely  so we will  not be making  a comment  on theappropriate  spread  relative to the nominal  yield.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  Mr. Chairman,  I will  only note that  I am not convinced by theargument.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let  me  suggest this:  Why don't the two of you have  abilateral  discussion  and if you  can add any additional  light, report it to the  rest  of us.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  That is  certainly a reasonable  proposition.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further questions?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval of the Desk's actions  andadding the  euro to the current list of designated  currencies.12/22/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection  I assume  approval  of both.  We nowmove on  to Karen Johnson  and Mike Prell.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  We received  October trade  data after the Greenbookforecast  was prepared,  so I would like  to start by  describing the implicationsof those data  for our understanding  of the foreign sector during the currentquarter.  Both exports  and imports surprised  us on the upside, but thesurprise was  significantly  greater for exports.  In terms  of trade categories,exports  of machinery--other  than computers--and  industrial  supplies  bothsurprised us  by the size of their increases.  The  miss was  not in  aircraft orother items  where large-size transactions  can introduce  noise into monthlydata.  This surprising  strength in exports may be a signal  that recovery  isproceeding  a bit more rapidly in  some  parts of the  world than we haveallowed for in the forecast,  but we have no direct evidence  of that  yet  andhesitate to put too much weight on  one month's  trade data.The October data nevertheless  lead us to expect fairly robust growth  ofexports in the fourth  quarter, after three quarters  of decline.  Combiningstronger exports  with  a  small revision to our outlook for imports results in  adownward  revision to our estimate for the quarter of the  negativecontribution  of net exports  to U.S.  GDP growth  from 0.7 percent  at anannual rate  to 0.3  percent.  For 1999  and 2000, we  still look for the  dragfrom net exports  to ease from about 1/2 percentage  point next year  to close to1/4 percentage  point in 2000 after an  estimated  1  percentage  points for thisyear as a  whole.Our expectation  that the drag exerted on  real  GDP growth  by theexternal  sector will diminish  over the forecast  period depends  importantlyon the modest rebound of exports  that  we are forecasting.  The  impetus forthat rebound lies partly in  the waning effects  of past dollar appreciation  andpartly in the strengthening  we anticipate in  average  foreign output growth,which  has been exceptionally weak  in  1998.  In the Greenbook,  the recoveryin foreign  growth  entails  a return  to  low but positive growth  in thedeveloping  countries  of Asia, some  slowing in Latin America  but notcollapse,  and a  substantial reduction  in  the rate  of decline  in output in Japan.For each of these regions,  our forecast  is relatively conservative  in that it isless optimistic  than is the latest consensus  forecast.As  in November,  our outlook for developments  abroad incorporates  theassumption that the international  financial package  put together for Brazil,including  successful implementation  of the macroeconomic  policies  laid outin the IMF program,  restores  market confidence.  As  a consequence,although real  activity  in Brazil  declines  sharply, the Brazilian  exchange  rateregime  remains  in place  and contagion to other economies  in the region orelsewhere is kept to a minimum.  As we indicated  in  the Greenbook,  we12/22/98view  the risks to this  baseline forecast  of a less  favorable outcome  in Brazilas  somewhat  greater now in  light of the failure  of the Brazilian  Congress  topass all the elements of a public sector pension  reform package put before itearlier this month.  Moreover,  capital  continues to flow out  of Brazil on  anet basis most days.Last week, Brazil  made an  initial drawing  on both the funds availablethrough  the IMF program  and the funds  available on a  bilateral basis,  for atotal  of just over $9  billion.  These resources  have been added to Brazil'sinternational  reserves.  The Brazilian government  has announced  itsintention to resubmit to the  Congress  next year the measures  that did notpass in December  and to proceed to implement the  other elements  of theIMF  program.  We look  for those  steps  to put a halt  to private  net capitaloutflows  and to contribute  to improved  financial  market conditions, but werecognize  that a return to crisis conditions  in Brazil,  and  spillover toArgentina, Mexico,  and  other emerging  markets,  is still a  distinct possibility.For that reason,  we again included  in the Greenbook  an alternative  scenariothat incorporates  a  more pessimistic  projection  for Brazil, including  a breakin the  exchange  rate regime  and the spread  of contagion  in Latin  America.That  scenario  implies that  U.S. real  GDP  growth  would be 1/22 to 3/4percentage point  lower in  1999 and 2000,  respectively.Mr. Prell  will continue  our presentation.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  As  Karen noted, the October trade report  seems to pointto  a considerably  higher level  of net exports than  was built into ourGreenbook  estimate  of real GDP  growth  in the current quarter.  However,yesterday  we received  the Monthly Treasury Statement  (MTS) forThe two adjustments  are almost  offsetting,  leaving  us  now just a  hair abovethe  3.1  percent GDP figure in  last Wednesday's  Greenbook.That  said, activity this quarter  appears  once  again to have surpassed ourprevious  forecasts.  What is the explanation  this  time?  Unfortunately, Ican't  give  as neat an  answer as I  would like.  Clearly,  one piece  of the storyis our earlier underestimation  of the rise in motor  vehicle production,  whichaccounts  for about half the extra  growth  of GDP in the current quarter.Some of this reflects  the automakers'  competition  for retail market  share,but heavy trucks have been  strong, too.  Another  piece of the story is  that,while  we thought  that homebuilders  had a sizable  backlog of demand tomeet, we couldn't foresee  that the weather  would be  as  cooperative  as it hasbeen.  Builders  have been  able to keep  workers  on  construction  sites,avoiding  a good part of the normal  seasonal  downswing  in activity.  Ofcourse,  the fact that this  Committee chose  to ease  policy  faster than we'dassumed  hasn't hurt either the auto  or the housing  markets.12/22/98Beyond that, though,  things  get murkier.  That's partly because  of theincoherence of the current  picture in the  industrial  sector, outside of motorvehicles.  In  particular, one might  think from many  company reports andsurveys  that the output of other manufacturers  would be weaker than  ourindustrial  production estimates  show  them to be.  But, to deepen  themystery, the  IP data themselves  are weaker over the second  half of this yearthan  would be  suggested by the corresponding  expenditure  components  ofGDP.  Perhaps  subsequent data will narrow these  gaps, but for now all thisraises  some  question about just how strong  the economy has been of late andit makes it more difficult to  get a handle  on the dynamics  of the situation.That brings me to the prospects for the further slowing of GDP growthin  1999.  As  you know,  we're putting  a lot of weight  on the notion thataccelerator  effects should be  shifting into reverse over the coming  quarters.That is, the  flatness of output growth  for a while now implies  that we shouldexpect  the level  of investment to tend to stabilize.As the perceptions  of businesses  and households  regarding  theprospects  for their sales and incomes  moved up in recent years, theypresumably  wanted to expand their  stocks of capital goods  to levels  thatwould help provide  the larger flows of production  and consumptionservices.  Spending  on business equipment, houses,  and consumer durablesconsequently  rose markedly.  At this point,  though, such  spending is so highthat, even if it leveled off, the net additions  to the  stocks of these goodswould remain substantial.  For producer  and consumer durables,  decliningrelative prices likely will continue to elevate desired  ratios of capital tooutput, but we doubt  that it will  be by  enough to override  this basicaccelerator mechanism.How can  we be sure that this pattern  will play  out in  the near term?  Wecan't be.  But the evidence of low capacity  utilization  and profitcompression in many segments  of manufacturing  gives  some concretenessto this model,  and reports  of companies actually  planning  to trim theircapital outlays or seeking  to take out capacity  through mergers  do  give somecredibility to the prediction.  One might even  be tempted to argue  that therecent upside surprises  in  investment expenditures reinforce  the  case foranticipating a moderation  going forward because  they  have further  elevatedthe rate of capital  accumulation.  However,  there  are  a couple  of obviousretorts to this assertion.  First, the mere fact that there have been  surprises ininvestment spending  underscores  the imprecision  of this analysis.  It's noteasy to gauge the desired stocks  and the time profile of the  adjustmentprocesses.  Second, the desired  stocks can change over time for a variety ofreasons.  Among  them are changes in the cost of capital  or in householdwealth, and in this regard the behavior  of the equity markets has repeatedlyconfounded us in our forecasts.12/22/98The stock market  remains a major wild card in the outlook.  Heartenedat least in  part by  what has been  viewed as  a  supportive Fed, investors havebeen  willing to  stick with equities  even  as  corporate earnings  have declined.PE ratios have  reached  very high levels.  Neither our earnings  forecast  norour interest rate forecast would seem to justify a further rise in  share pricesover the next couple  of years, and thus we're expecting that wealth  effectswill ebb,  taking a good deal  of the steam  out of aggregate  demand.The behavior of stocks like eBay and  Amazon.com  might suggest  thatwe're  applying  an obsolete paradigm  for share  valuation.  But, it may benoted that the  market as a  whole really hasn't made much further headwayon net since  the early spring, when  the year-on-year profit comparisonsbegan  to turn negative.  We're essentially predicting  that share prices  willcontinue  to fluctuate  around the average  level  that has prevailed since  thattime.  A continuation  of crummy earnings  and poor returns  might providethe basis  for a deeper market correction,  but we're hesitant to  predict itwhen the market  has shown  such  a capacity for levitation  and when wearen't anticipating  any monetary policy tightening.  Indeed, as our selectionof alternative  simulations in the Greenbook  suggested,  we wouldn't  rule outa further rise in share  prices,  and another year or two of double-digitincreases  could trump  the reverse  accelerator effects that  are key to ourforecast.  The market  surge of the past three trading days is perhaps  a  sign inthat  regard.Finally, a few  words about the supply side  of our forecast:  The recentupside surprise  in GDP  growth  does not appear to reflect  any unexpectedimprovement  in productivity  trends.  Rather, what  we've seen has  beenconsistent  with the  trend we have  been  assuming.  So, going  forward, ourhigher output path has  translated  into a lower  unemployment rate.  We'veraised our inflation  forecast, but not quite commensurately.  Recent newson  wages and prices has  been favorable,  even  in  the face  of tighter  laborbe  prevailing.  In  addition, the  prices of oil and other raw materials  havefallen  out of bed recently,  and these lower input costs  will be  passingthrough the production pipeline  for a while,  in the process  helping to  holddown  inflation  expectations.  One might question  whether  this commoditydeflation  is an unalloyed  blessing  in terms of international  economicstability,  but it is one more timely shock  helping to  check inflation  here.That  completes our presentation,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Karen,  am I correct  in assuming  that the imports intothe United States have  been  tracking under what  our models would have  suggested?

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  Yes,  but not by much.  The import equation  has been doing  fairly  well.12/22/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  So there is  no evidence  at  this stage  that the differencesbetween  income elasticities  on the export  and import side  are  showing  any change from what wehave  seen  over the years?

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  Not  convincing evidence  yet, no.  The thought is in my mind, giventhe enormous  changes in  potential  GDP growth  everywhere.  The fact that we  see potential  in theUnited States  going up--and  we certainly  have written  down the potential  for Japan  and othercountries  a great deal--suggests  that whatever the deeply embedded fundamentals  that give riseto these elasticities  are, they may be changing,  too.  We can look at that question again,  but thereis nothing about the past six months or  so of data that would cause one to think that that must behappening.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I have a comment and a question.  First the comment:Karen,  I would like  to thank you for the memo  on China that  was done  by John  Fernald.  It wasvery responsive to the questions  I raised at the last meeting and  also provided  a lot of goodinformation.  It explained why China has performed  better over this period, particularly  sincehighly recommend  it.Second,  in Part II of the Greenbook  there was  reference  to an  attempt by Boeing tomake  a lot of deliveries  in the month of December.  My  recollection  from the past has been  thatat times that has  had impacts  both on production  and certainly  on the composition  of GDP,particularly if a lot of those deliveries  were to foreign buyers.  Can  you tell me  what some  of theeffects of that  are  likely to be and if they are included in the fourth-quarter numbers?12/22/98

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We  try to  track their production  and delivery plans  as closely  aspossible,  with the help of some  inside contacts.  One of the  uncertainties  at this  point is whether,indeed,  they will be  able to make the  volume  of deliveries  to foreign customers  that  they hopedto make, because  there seem  to be  financing problems  still to be worked  out.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  So  they end  up in inventory?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  They have  been  in inventory.  We think those  inventories  are beingreduced in this quarter, and  that is  part  of our forecast.  There  is coherence  in  our arithmetic.  Infact, in the ultimate  GDP numbers--when  we  try to sort through  all of this--we  can't find  thecoherence  that we have  as  we  put these  numbers together ourselves.  So ex  post, it is  very hard  totrace.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  But, in terms  of our forecast, we have  taken into  account  theirproduction  intentions  and their  delivery patterns.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  They are  one of the  few companies  where  a change  in their sales canshow up in  the GDP numbers.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It  is potentially  significant  on a quarter-to-quarter  basis.  I think  wesometimes  overestimate  the importance  of aircraft in  total producers'  durable  expenditures  in theUnited  States,  but certainly it can be a  significant  quarter-to-quarter  swing factor.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  We  had several  area academic  economists  in for a meeting  a weekor so ago, including  some  from M.I.T.  and Harvard, and  I had some people  from the investmentcommunity  in for breakfast earlier this  week.  Almost everybody's  projection for the fourth12/22/98 16quarter is well  above  3.1  percent.  Many  are hedging their bets,  saying fourth-quarter  growth  islikely to be in  the 3-1/2  to 4-1/2  percent range.  But at least  a couple  of people  who usually are  ontrack  on this had point projections  above  4 percent.  I wonder  what you think about that type ofprojection  and  what it means for early  1999.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  There  is a lot of room  to maneuver at this  point with the data that  arenow in hand.  I  would not put 4-1/2  percent out of the range of possibilities.  They did not have thebenefit of the MTS,  though.  That  can be pretty tricky to read.  We made  that effort  and it didchip a bit off the fourth-quarter number.  Another  possibility is that people  have not interpretedthe net export figures the same as we did.  We have  one month of data, the first month of thequarter.  Does one extrapolate  an upside  surprise  or anticipate  an offset?  I think Karen'scolleagues scrutinize these  data perhaps  with greater care than others,  but it is  still very difficultto judge  whether this component  or that component  will drop off.  Finally, on that score, oneneeds  to look also at whether there  are  offsets in domestic expenditures.  Relative  to what we hadassumed, the net exports  of capital  goods  were  stronger in October  than we had anticipated.  Thatmeans less of the flow of shipments  will be going to domestic customers.  So there was  asignificant offset in producers'  durable equipment  expenditures  as we did the adding up.  But inthe end one is  looking at production indicators:  employment,  hours, the  industrial productiondata, and so on.  As we balanced these things out, we felt  uncomfortable  going higher  than wedid because  there just seemed to be considerable  tension.  We wrote down  a relatively  lowinventory investment number--much  lower, I think, than did many of those  outside forecasters.That  is a product  of this balancing  act.  We had some low October  inventory numbers  but there  isstill a lot of room for November and December to surprise us.  That was one of the balancingfactors.  I suspect that if you looked at these  other forecasts,  you probably  would not find12/22/98 17inventory investment  as low because  others  didn't feel  as  constrained as we felt by theseproduction-side  indicators.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  So  you think the  balance  of the risks is on the  upside?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I guess  I feel the  fatter  tail of this  probability  distribution is on that  side.On  the other hand,  as  I pointed  out, there are  inconsistencies  in some of the information  we  aregetting.  It is really  hard to determine  where  all  these  goods  are that supposedly  have beenproduced.  Anecdotally,  it does not sound right; and our own statistics just do not show it.  Andthat is true over the second half of the year as  a  whole.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  My own investigations  in  the last couple of weeks  would suggestthat they are in Bloomingdales!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In inventories  for the time being, I take it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is that  where all the steel  is?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I  don't know.  There's lots of inventory there.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  A lot of imported apparel.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further questions  for either of our colleagues?  Ifnot, who would like to  start our discussion?  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  On balance,  Mr.  Chairman, the Fifth District economy  appears tobe  continuing to expand  at a moderate  pace.  Retailers  are reporting  very busy stores, briskholiday  sales, and the  strength  seems to be  broadly based.  Specialty  stores  and apparel  shops,big box discounters, building  supply  stores, and hardware  stores  all appear to be  doing very  well.told us that their credit  card receivables  increasedmore than  10  percent in November  over October, which  obviously is a huge increase.  We arealso hearing of increased strength  in residential  and  commercial real estate.  Local housing12/22/98 18stronger than they were  a  few weeks  ago.  Notably,  institutional financing  for office  and retailspace construction  appears  to have returned  to at least  some parts  of the District  afterdisappearing for a while in  the third quarter  as  a result of the market turbulence.On the other hand,  our contacts in the manufacturing  sector continue  to report  thatDistrict plants  and factories  are  feeling the effects  of lower commodity  prices  and increasedforeign competition.  As  you know,  we do a monthly  manufacturing  survey  and it showed thatemployment  dropped sharply in  the manufacturing  sector, particularly in the tobacco  industry,machinery fabrication,  and textiles.  But on the more encouraging  side, the survey  also indicatedthat factory  shipments rose in November to  a  level  we have not seen for some time.  We have aquestion in that survey  about expectations  of future  shipments and, somewhat  encouragingly,that figure  rose in  November for the  first time  since May.  So, there  may be some signs of abottoming out in  this sector, although  the signs are  still fairly weak.As far as  labor markets  in our region  are  concerned,  it's hard to believe but, ifanything, they seem to be getting  even  tighter in  the service  sector, especially  in the informationtechnology  sector.  We get more  reports of labor shortages now than we  did a while back, andefforts to hire and retain  workers  are really  very aggressive.  They  were  already aggressive but, ifanything, that aggressiveness  has become  even  more visible recently.At the national level,  we agree  with  the staff that the most likely outcome in comingmonths is that real GDP growth will decline to  a rate closer to trend.  It certainly  seemsreasonable  to expect  business investment in particular  to decelerate,  given  the prospectiveslowing in  corporate  earnings.  But a good deal  of the current momentum  in consumer  spendingshould carry through,  underpinned  by the recent strong growth in jobs and in real wages.12/22/98I think the important  point here is  that even if overall growth does in  fact slow  totrend, that will not necessarily relieve the  current extraordinary  tightness  in  labor markets.  It willonly stop the  tightening that has been  accompanying  above  trend real  growth from increasingfurther.  In other words,  even  with the  slowing, we may still be  above the maximum path onwhich the economy can grow  without  an increase in inflation  at some point down the road.  Itcertainly proves that inflation  currently remains  exceptionally  well behaved.  We can take  somecredit  for that, I think, and  we should.  But some time next year the decline in commodity  pricesand in import prices  of manufactured goods  should end as  Asian economies  begin to heal.  Atthat point, goods  price inflation  could well bottom  out and begin to rise rather than offsetting theservice price increases  as  has been the case recently.With  this in mind, and as we enter a period where  our focus is shifting from trying toachieve price stability  to trying  to maintain price stability,  I think we need to ask ourselves howwe judge whether the policy choices  we are making now are laying the foundation  for continuedlow inflation or a resurgence  of inflation,  or for that matter deflation.  The Greenbook forecastand the assumptions  underlying  it serve  as  the basis  for the  Committee's discussion of thiscrucial  question  at each  meeting.  Of course,  the Greenbook,  as we know,  presents  a forecast  thatis conditioned  on a funds rate path.  Presumably that  path is  the one  the staff believes isconsistent with the  maintenance  of the nearly  stable price level we have  now managed toachieve.  In effect,  the Greenbook  prejudges to some  extent where the funds rate needs to be.But it does not routinely present  the  core model  and judgment  used in arriving at that path for thefunds rate, which  makes it harder, for me at least, to evaluate whether  the path is the appropriateone or not.12/22/98In the current  situation,  for example, the  Greenbook projects  that a constant funds rateat its present level  would be consistent  with no acceleration  in  core inflation over the next coupleof years.  I'm not necessarily  criticizing  that assumption;  it is a reasonable  assumption, Isuppose.  I'm just saying that I personally  do  not understand  fully the basis  for that assumption.It would be really helpful to  see  in more detail the  core model and the analysis  that is used inmaking that call.  I don't mean to  sound critical  of the staff on this.  In my opinion, the staff doesa consistently  fine job with a nearly impossible  assignment.  But I  do think, especially in  thisnew  situation we face, that the Committee  would be in a better position to make  the best policy

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Mr. Chairman,  if I could just respond briefly.  I am not sure I fullygrasp the point that President Broaddus  is making. I will follow  up bilaterally with him to makesure I have an understanding.  But just to be clear on the basis of our assumption for the fundsrate, let me say that our default is to assume a  stable funds rate  unless we see when  we runthrough our projection  that  we end up with an  outcome that is  glaringly at odds with  what theCommittee in its discussions  and its policy decisions  has suggested would be acceptable.  Havinglistened to the discussions  at recent meetings,  people have basically  said they would be veryhappy if we had an  outcome  like that.  So, I do not have  a sense  that,  with our forecast  based on  astable funds rate  assumption,  we are giving  you something that  does not provide  a baseline  fordiscussion.  Then, obviously,  we try to  give some indication  of what different interest rate pathsmight produce.  So, that is how  we approach  this.  I hope that's helpful in some degree,  but I willtry to clarify it.12/22/98

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Let me just respond to that, Mike.  You  say you run it through themodel.  A more explicit discussion of how  that is done and what judgments  are  made so we canfeel  comfortable  with a constant  funds rate in this forecast  would be helpful  to me.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That is going to  be  very difficult to portray because  there is a  good dealof judgment involved.  In  addition to the  use of the quarterly  model, we  get input from  sectorexperts and so on.  As you know,  we have  invited Reserve Banks  to  send staff members--andthey have--to join us during  a portion of our forecasting  process  so that they can  get a betterhandle  on  the various steps and the  different inputs.  If your Bank hasn't sent  someone recentlyor if your staff's  memory of what they saw  has faded, we certainly invite  you to send someone inthe near future.  I think that is perhaps  the  best way to understand  what goes on.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  economic  activity in the Twelfth  District has expandedat a solid pace  in recent months,  and our business contacts  are less downbeat concerning growthprospects than they were during the  summer and early fall.  Total payroll  employment has grownby 2.6 percent  at an annual  rate since  midyear,  above the  2 percent rate  of growth in the rest ofthe  country.  California's  expansion remains  on track, and  growth in  the San Francisco  Bay areapicked up recently  after slowing earlier  in the  year.  Growth  is rapid in  several other states,  withNevada  and Arizona ranked first  and third in the national  employment  growth  ranking.Construction  activity in the  District has been  robust.  Construction  employment  hasgrown  rapidly all  year, largely due to  strong demand  for new homes.  Although  nonresidentialconstruction plans have  fallen a bit in the  District this  year, conditions  in commercial  real  estate12/22/98 22limited effects  of the  year's turmoil in the market for commercial  real estate  finance.The ongoing  slowdown  in manufacturing  is the weak  spot in the District economy.After earlier  gains that far outstripped  the national pace,  employment in District  manufacturinghas fallen since  the first quarter.  The role of East Asia has  been critical.  For example, theto the  same periods a  year ago, California exports to East Asia in  1998 fell  12.7 percent  in thefirst quarter,  17.5  percent in the first  half, and 20.6  percent in the first nine  months.  Moreover,the employment  situation at Boeing has exerted a  moderating influence  on the Washington  Stateeconomy.  This restraint  will become  more  pronounced  as Boeing implements  a 20 percent cut inits workforce  during the next two  years.  The impact on  Boeing and its suppliers  in the LosAngeles  area already is evident in  the loss of nearly  1,500  aircraft manufacturing jobs so far thisyear.On the national  front, just three months ago  it appeared  that the chance of a  U.Srecession, or at least a major slowdown,  was  uncomfortably  high.  This prospect,  in my view,had shrunk noticeably  by our November meeting  and has fallen  further since  then.  Although  theeconomy faces  substantial risks, the most likely outcome  over the next year appears  favorable.Recent  data on economic  activity in  the third and fourth  quarters  have continued  to follow  thepattern  of surprisingly strong  output growth and low inflation  that we've seen for about threeyears.In  addition  to this factor, the outlook has improved since  November because  of ourmost recent funds rate  cut, the better-than-expected economic  performance  in the rest of theworld in the  second half of this year, and  the rebound in  the stock market.  Our forecast  for real12/22/98 23GDP growth  in  1999 has  been  revised up by 3/4  percentage  point to 2-3/4 percent  under theassumption  of no further change  in  either the funds rate or the U.S.  stock market.  We expectinflation  to hold steady next year despite upward pressure  from tight labor markets.  The familiarlist of favorable inflation  factors seems likely  to apply:  robust productivity  growth, ampleindustrial capacity,  low commodity prices,  and subdued  inflation  expectations.  Overall,  weexpect inflation  in the  core CPI to come in  at around 2-1/4 percent in  1999.Although  the  most likely outcome  for the economy next year appears  favorable,  therisks  are large.  The potential  problems  stemming  from fragility in many Asian and LatinAmerican  economies  as  well as  in international  and domestic  financial markets  are obvious.  Buton the  other side,  the pattern of positive  surprises in  our economy could continue, especially inlight of the  very rapid growth  in  money and  credit this year.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in  the Seventh Districtgenerally  remain quite  similar to what I reported  in November, with the  major difference  beingthat the anxiety level  among our contacts  seems to  have come  down  somewhat.  Uncertaintyabout  the domestic  and global  economies  remains  high, but the heightened concerns  about creditavailability  that were  so apparent in September and  October have eased somewhat as a result ofour actions  to lower interest  rates as well as  similar moves  taken by other central  banks  aroundthe world.Our District's  economy continues  to show trends  similar to what I mentioned lasttime.  Housing  activity remains  strong;  consumer spending  continues  to be relatively  healthy.Warmer-than-normal  weather has helped maintain  construction  activity at high levels,  but it hashurt  sales of winter apparel,  auto batteries,  and snow  removal equipment.  More  generally,  sales12/22/98 24so far this  season have  been reasonably  good,  though mixed by type of retailer.  Departmentstores generally have  been disappointed  and have  stepped up promotional  activity.  In contrast,the discounters,  the  specialty apparel  chains,  and home-oriented  stores have reported  strongsales.  I guess  Bloomingdales  is not in  that category!  Light  vehicle sales  are expected  to bestrong again  in December, boosted in  part by especially  intense competition  between  the ToyotaCamry and the Honda  Accord  for best selling car of  1998.On  balance, manufacturing  activity continues  at a  high  level,  with  strength in someindustries  offsetting  weakness  in others.  Reflecting  these  offsetting forces,  the ChicagoPurchasing Managers'  Composite  Index for December  shows  a slight pickup  in overall  activityfrom  50.2 percent  in November  to 50.9 percent  in December.  This  information will  not bereleased to the public  until December 31,  so it should be  considered confidential  until that time.Manufacturing  contacts  reported  strong demand  for aluminum, housing-related  products,  andboth light and heavy  motor vehicles.  But weaknesses  in foreign  markets  and low  commodityprices continue  to have an  adverse  impact on  producers  of oil-related products,  steel, andagricultural  equipment.  One steel  producer indicated that annual  contracts  now being negotiatedwith customers  for 1999  are averaging  a decline in prices of about  5 percent  from  1998 levels.More generally,  conditions in the agricultural  sector remain  weak, particularly  amonghog producers,  as has been  widely publicized  especially  in our District.  Hog prices  inmid-December  were almost  75  percent  below  a year ago, although  retail prices  have not fallennearly as  much.  The price  declines  are largely due  to substantial  production  hikes.  The largeoperators are  hoping that  existing facilities  will  be grandfathered  under potential  legislation  thatis likely to limit future expansion due  to environmental  concerns.12/22/98Overall,  price pressures  remain  benign.  District labor markets are  still tight, althoughthe unemployment  rate for our five states did edge up slightly last month  to 3.7 percent  from 3.6percent  in October.Turning to the  national  outlook, our forecast is  similar to that of the Greenbook.  Wehosted our annual  economic  outlook symposium earlier this month,  and the consensus  outlookfrom that group  of 31  Midwest economists  was quite  similar as well.  The  strength of consumerdemand  has been  very impressive  of late and some slowing seems  most likely.  Despiteheightened  media  attention to the low personal  saving rate, wealth  levels and confidence remainhigh and interest rates  remain low.  Therefore,  we expect consumer spending growth  to continuereasonably  strong.  The deterioration  of the profits  picture and,  as Mike  Prell mentioned, the lackof accelerator effects should  cause investment spending  growth  to  slow but  only back to morenormal levels.So, overall, we  expect aggregate  demand to remain  strong enough to keep laborpickup in inflation.  Our chief downside concerns  remain the poor prospects for  growth  abroad,the Brazilian  situation that Karen Johnson discussed,  and still  somewhat  fragile financial  marketconditions,  although  our policy actions appear to have  helped settle  the markets.  Still,  with thefull effects  of our recent  policy actions yet to be felt, the risks to the outlook seem to be relativelybalanced.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman,  local conditions  in the Eighth  District are largelyunchanged.12/22/98that comments  from these sources  are  confidential, of course.I would noteThere is no question  that the  agricultural  regions  in our District are  hurting.  Many ofthe farmers  have taken  substantial  losses.  At this point their credit is not really impaired,although  some may have problems  obtaining credit for the next planting season.  As aconsequence  of the weakness  in  the agricultural  regions,  there is  a very pronounced  slowing inthe  agricultural  machinery sector.  Sales of farm equipment are  down substantially,  and I thinkwe  see that in  our national  statistics.  Homebuilding, without question,  is strong except  in theagricultural  areas.  We had a report from  southern  Indiana that homebuilders  are on  allocation  forbricks, believe it or not.  A contact in Kentucky reports that builders  have a two-year backlog.  I12/22/98 27think that situation  is generally quite typical  in  the urban  areas.  The labor market is  very strongin  most areas, again  except in  the  agricultural  regions.On the  national  outlook,  the staff forecast  looks about right to me.  However, I believethat our inflation  risks  are clearly  on the upside rather than the  downside.  I continue to beconcerned  about the high rate of money growth.  I wonder whether  the  staff outlook oninvestment  is not giving enough  weight to the  very tight labor markets, which provide  anincentive  for firms to invest  to substitute capital  for labor.  I think our traditional  acceleratormodels may be missing the connection  between the labor markets  and business investment.  Thatis all  I have for now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  There is not a whole lot new in NewEngland,  at least since the last Committee meeting.  The regional  economy  continues to grow,albeit  at a  pace a bit lower than earlier in  the year.  Unemployment  varies  by state but in theaggregate  is about a percentage  point lower  than in the rest of the  country.  Job growth,  incontrast,  is slower than in  the nation  as  a whole,  with New Hampshire  having fewer jobs than ayear ago  for the second  month  in a row.As I noted at the last meeting,  some  of this slowness in job growth reflects  the region'sdemographic  trends.  Population  in New  England simply grows more  slowly than in  the rest ofthe nation.  We  frequently hear stories that  growth  in certain  industries, medical  care forexample,  is hampered  by the  lack of available labor supply.  The fastest growing industries in theregion continue to be construction,  the general  area of finance,  and services.  Manufacturing  jobsto the troubled Asian  areas.12/22/98Defense-intensive  industries by contrast  added employment, even  in the generallyweaker  environment for manufacturing.  We think this is because  national  defense  spending isscheduled  to rise in real terms in fiscal  year  1999  after more than a  decade  of decline.  The juryis out on how  this will  affect the New  England defense industry, but there  is at least someprospect that major firms  will  hold their own.Real  estate markets,  especially  in Boston, remain relatively  upbeat.  Speculativeconstruction has  largely halted but some  new space  is coming on  line nonetheless.  Wall  Streetfinancing dried up during  the late summer and fall  market turmoil but other investors  filled thegap, albeit  at higher  financing rates.  Outside the Boston  metropolitan  area, both  residential  andcommercial  real  estate markets  are  more mixed.  Residential  construction  slowed  a bit and newhome sales were down  despite  the quite advantageous  financing  situation.On the commercial  side, Hartford  continues  to be soft.  That  probably explains  in partthe city's willingness  to give away  the store to the New England Patriots!  But New  Haven  andStamford, and the  State of Rhode Island  are  all  doing well.  Lending  at the region's  largest banksremained quite strong,  particularly on the commercial  and industrial side,  where  quarterlyannualized  growth  rates  were  35 percent  versus  around 20 percent  for the nation  as  a whole.This largely  reflects  growth in C&I lending at the Bank of Boston  where  customers  chose toaccess  credit lines in  the fall when  Wall Street  financing became  difficult  or impossible to comeby.Finally, as I mentioned  before,  we held a meeting of the Bank's  academic  advisorycouncil last week  with  several of the deans  of the economics  profession  in attendance.  Opinionsin the group were  divided  about prospects  for the economy.  Some  believed, based  on thisquarter's  surprising strength,  the tightness  of labor markets,  and the  ease in monetary  and12/22/98 29financial conditions,  that 1999 could test whether 3.9  percent unemployment is compatible  withprice stability.  Others  saw the risks more on  the downside,  with a negative  saving rate,  decliningcorporate profits,  and the  troubled external  sector  posing threats  and  trimming  growth  to ratesbelow potential.  However,  there was  almost no support  for further near-term  easing even  amongthose who perceive the  downside risks as  significant.  A wait-and-see  policy was  counseled.There  also was  concern  that financial  and especially stock  market conditions might have  beenaccorded too much  weight in monetary policymaking  of late.Turning to the national  outlook, we were pleased  to see the change in the Greenbookforecast from November.  The Greenbook now projects rates  of GDP growth  and levels  ofunemployment  in  1999  that are  quite close to our own.  We differ a bit on the inflationary  path,as we have  over time.  But we have  been  continually wrong in  that area,  so I must say I am a bithumble in that regard.Overall, both the Greenbook  and our own forecast describe  an economic  picture thatvery few downside risks,  on the domestic front anyway.  The question is whether this outcomewill  actually occur.  Others  have  spoken  about risks  and I,  too, think that there are  large risks.And they occur on both  sides.  On the plus side,  the momentum from  1998 could propel  growthin  1999 and tighten labor markets  further.  In this  scenario,  consumers would not retrench  andthe negative impact of a  slowing  economy might not affect corporate profits  as significantly.  Ifthis coincided with  some luck on the external  side--if Japan's  growth,  for example,  turnedslightly positive or the  euro  acted as a major positive for growth  in "Euroland"--then  conditionsmight be right for an  even greater  spurt of inflationary pressure than we project.12/22/98 30On  the downside,  and maybe  more significant  in terms of probability,  growth could  beslower if consumers  did decide  that the risks posed by higher layoffs,  declining  corporate  profits,and a  volatile stock market require  them to save more  and spend less than projected.  Waningcorporate  profits could cause the stock  market to decline  sharply  rather than to move roughlysideways,  as we  and the  Greenbook have  projected, and could encourage  further consumerretrenchment.  Bad luck on the external  side--Brazil,  for example--could  well  add to the negativeeffect.As  I consider these risks both on the upside and the downside,  I must  say I am struckby the high cost of being wrong.  From where we  are now, necessary  policy changes  to correctsituations  could well produce  negative results, at least initially.  If U.S.  and world  growth isstronger than projected,  it seems  inevitable  that financial  markets  will soar and inflationarypressures  will rise.  The  question will be whether  we can intervene  in time.  Policy correctionruns the not inconsiderable  risk of producing  a boom/bust  scenario.  If growth is  slower, furthereasing might well be necessary.  However,  at least in the short run given current marketconditions,  an easing could propel markets  to new  highs only to risk  a sharper correction  later.The  Greenbook forecast assumes  no change in  policy and our forecast  does  as well;  and for rightnow  that seems  to be the best course.  But I think we  all better hope that the forecast  is rightbecause it seems, to me anyway,  that the room to  maneuver in  the case of error is very small.

MR. BOEHNE.  The regional  economy  in the Philadelphia District is healthy,although  weakness in manufacturing persists.  Attitudes  are positive and prospects for continuedexpansion  are good.  Retail  sales appear to be matching expectations.  Consumers  are  shopping,though, with  an eye for bargains.  High-end  brands that offer good values are moving  while12/22/98 31high-end  brands that simply  offer prestige are  sitting on the  shelf.  Supermarkets  have beenresponding  to value-concerned  consumers  as well  by upgrading the quality  of their store brandswhile holding prices  below those of nationally advertised  brands.  As  a result--and  I think this isan interesting statistic--the  store-brand share  of sales has risen recently to 25  percent from about15  percent.  Auto dealers  report the  same  value consciousness  because  they have  to offerdiscounts to  move cars.  Pressures on profit margins  are mentioned frequently  by businesspeople.  Wage  costs are up some, but raising prices  is not competitively  feasible.In commercial  construction, there appears  to be  a reasonable  balance of supply anddemand.  The rental  market is strong  and vacancy rates  are  low, but there are  a few  signs ofoverbuilding.  The market is expected to stay on a  solid footing, with  vacancy rates  stabilizingaround  10 percent  and with no building boom.  All  in all,  the  regional  economy appears  to be ontrack for moderate growth  during  the coming months,  with labor markets  tight and inflation  incheck.For the national economy, I think we have  an unusually  wide spectrum  of plausibleoutcomes.  I can envision  an economy that expands  well  above the Greenbook forecast.  Theeconomy  has shown  a lot of resiliency.  There is an internal  dynamic  there that could provide thewherewithal  for a surprisingly strong growth rate next year.  I can  also envision  an economy  thatcomes in on the weak side.  There are  vulnerabilities  and we  all  know them;  I don't need to tickthem off.  A combination of adverse factors could make  for a very bearish  performance.  TheGreenbook forecast  is a reasonable  guess among these wide-ranging  alternatives.  Who knows, itmight actually come to pass,  more or less.  That is a compliment!  [Laughter]12/22/98 32The good news is that  we are operating in a low  inflation, high employmentenvironment  that allows  some  maneuvering  room  for monetary  policy should the  unexpectedoccur.  But in the current relative  calm, we  still need to stay awake  and remain  alert.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman,  over the past six weeks,  the Sixth District hascontinued to grow at a healthy but slower rate than was the case earlier  this year.  We expect thatsame  pace to continue into next year.  The big stories this time around  in our District  are tourismand energy.The  outlook for Florida tourism has been  noticeably less  upbeat than  it was earlier  inthe year.  Negative  fallout from the turbulence  in foreign  markets has adversely  affected  SouthFlorida and the Gulf Coast.  Particularly,  there  has been a  falloff in Latin American  tourism andthere  is concern  that the middle-income  tourist especially  will opt not to come  to Florida thisyear as  evidenced by the bookings  information  at some moderately  priced  South Florida hotels.Although  occupancy rates  are up  1 to  2 percent from last  year, 3-month forward bookings  are offsome  6  percent.  There is further concern  that a weak Canadian  dollar will keep away touristsfrom Canada,  a particularly  important  market for the west coast  of Florida and the panhandle  ofthe  state.  Even small declines  in tourism are significant  because  of the sheer size and importanceof the tourism industry,  which dwarfs  the entire economies  of several smaller  states in ourDistrict.producing parts of our District.  State revenues  in Louisiana  are  down significantly  because ofthe  drop in  oil and severance  taxes.  It  has been reported that the price of a barrel  of crude  is only25  cents  less than  the price  of a barrel  of gasoline,  and a gallon  of gasoline  now costs  less than a12/22/98 33gallon  of bottled water!  The result has been  a steep decline  in drilling activity.  The rig count inour area  is down  to  150 from  a high of about 210.  It is having  its effect on supply boats andother support activities.  There also is concern  about the  merger announced  between  Exxon andMobil, which  could put as  many as  10,000 Louisiana jobs at risk.  And yet, Bob McTeer, thosejobs are likely to show up in the State  of Texas.Finally,  although payroll employment growth  has slowed, labor markets  remainextremely tight.  There is still  concern about rising  wages but the bigger concern, as  others havesaid, relates  to the  availability and quality of the  remaining workers.  The only area where thereis  significant evidence of price  increases  is in health  care where costs are  expected to increase  ata double-digit rate  for many large employers.At the national level,  our broad outlook, like others, is not markedly different from theGreenbook  but with some differences in  composition.  I expect  some slowing in consumerspending,  business  fixed investment,  and housing, but to date there  is little concrete  evidence thatthose trends are beginning  to develop.  Indeed,  the near-term  outlook is more  positive now, giventhe revisions to  the estimated third-quarter  GDP and the likelihood of a strong fourth quarter aswell.My view  is that the more  pessimistic  forecasts  may be  giving too much  weight tofurther deterioration  in  the international  sector and its implications  for U.S. growth.  It is mysense  that we  probably have already  experienced  the brunt  of the  declines  that will take place  andthat our domestic  economy remains  quite  strong.  Employment  growth  continues  at a strongpace;  unemployment  is down; consumer incomes  are up;  and energy,  steel, and  other commodityinput prices  continue to come down.  The view  that declining corporate earnings projections  willboth damp investment  expenditures  and depress  share prices,  thereby  cutting back  on consumer12/22/98 34spending,  implies stronger impact multipliers  than we have  seen to date.  Interestingly,  some ofour recent research  shows much  less of a direct relationship  between  corporate profits  and realGDP  growth than  one might intuitively expect.Additionally, the effects of the past three rate cuts have not  yet fully worked their waythrough the economy.  Our model  simulation  suggests that only 40 percent  of a  policy move'stotal effect on GDP occurs  within two quarters  and that it takes some six quarters before  80percent of its effect is reflected.As others have  suggested, the largest downside risk seems  to be in Latin  America.Clearly, a major key lies in whether there  is further financial turmoil  in Brazil,  whetherauthorities  there can engineer  an orderly  depreciation of the real, which  would permit an easingof interest rates,  and whether  any currency  depreciation will be supported  and  accommodatedpeacefully  by Brazil's multilateral  creditors.  However, should Brazil experience  another crisis,the regional  outlook will suffer if contagion  spreads to other Latin  American  markets.Putting everything  together,  I think we have  a good chance of a moderate  slowdown  innear-term  growth  going forward.  Despite the  fact that the risks to the economy remain large  andsymmetric  at the current time.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  At the  broadest level,  the District economyremains healthy.  There is very little question  that it is continuing to expand.  But thatgeneralization  applies  principally to the major metropolitan  areas where construction,  bothresidential and nonresidential,  is strong and consumer spending is robust.  Labor  markets remain12/22/98 35very tight and  there are clear signs of wage  pressures,  especially  for entry-level jobs  where  firmshave  to bid up salaries  in order to attract  people.On  the other hand, parts  of the District that have  been struggling for some timecontinue to  struggle.  Agriculture,  and especially livestock,  is one example of that;  mining andthe energy  sector are  a second;  and parts  of the manufacturing  economy  are  a third.  I would saythat in those sectors,  if anything,  the problems  have become  more  significant and attitudes havedeteriorated  a bit further.  Of course, most people  and the bulk of the  economic  activities  are inthe  major metropolitan  areas, so in trying  to put this together  one doesn't want to exaggeratesome of those out-state problems,  as it were.As far as the national  economy  is concerned, two aspects  of it have  struck me  for sometime.  One is its resilience.  If you think about the events  that have buffeted the  national economyover the last 10 or more years  and counterpose  that  with its performance,  there is no question  thatresilience has been  a characteristic  of this economy.  The other somewhat related aspect  is thatwhile  we clearly have  had a lot  of turmoil coming from abroad, principally  in the last 18  monthsor so, the  economy seems  on net to have  weathered that well.  Of course,  when you cut  through itall,  those developments  are not entirely  negative either in terms of their implications for interestrates and inflation or for the  interest-sensitive  sectors of our economy.I think the outlook  for the economy  in  general  is positive in terms of sustainable  realgrowth.  There are a couple  of significant downside  risks that people have  commented  on.  Oneis the Brazilian situation  and another is,  at least in  some people's judgment, an excessivelyelevated  equity price.  But I don't know  what probabilities  to attach  to possible corrections  inthose  situations.  In fact,  it is my view that we probably will  get  more real growth  or at leastmore  growth in  aggregate  demand than is indicated in the Greenbook over the  next year or two.12/22/98 36Taken by itself that is certainly  positive.  The question  is  what rate  of inflation  is likely toaccompany  it.  So far at least,  the surprises  in the inflation  numbers  have been  on the  downsideand that is to the  good.  And the weakness  in commodity  prices  suggests  that that may continue.On the other hand, I must say that the rapid growth  in the monetary  aggregates  andgenerally  accommodative  credit conditions  do give  me some pause.  They  are  a source of at leastsome  potential  concern.  At a minimum we need to monitor that closely.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Texas employment growth has  decelerated  from fast to moderateduring the course  of 1998--from  about 4.6  percent in  1997  down  to about 2 percent  lately.  Threehead  winds or drags  are  causing  this growth to moderate.  One  is tight labor markets.  They havebeen  tight for a long time, but we have  less and  less ability  to attract  workers  into Texas  from therest of the country  because the markets  are  tight  everywhere  now.The low oil  prices that Jack Guynn  mentioned  have hit us  very  hard.  Incidentally,  ourcontacts  expect oil  prices to  remain  very  low for longer than the futures  markets  are  suggesting.In our District,  extraction employment  has  declined  by about  5,000  and the rig count hasthe country now  as they  were back in  1986.  Not only  are  we more  diversified, but  we have  moreenergy-using  industries  that benefit  from low oil  prices  than we  did then.Another factor slowing  our economy  is the  weakened  state of foreign  markets  forTexas exporters.  Earlier, in late 1997  and early  1998,  there was  a sharp  decline  in exports  toAsia.  That decline  is pretty much over;  there is  still a  slight movement  down in the trend  line,but it's almost flat  now.  Added  to  it, however, have been  some  declines  in  our exports  to Canadaand to Mexico  and Latin America more  generally.12/22/98On the national  economic  scene, I don't really have  any new or unique  insights tooffer.  The main point I  would make  is that while  some risks are associated  with the strongmomentum in the  real economy  at year-end--as  evidenced  by the possible reversal  of the  netexport drag, the  continued  tight labor  markets,  and rapid money growth--those  developmentscontinue to occur in the  context of worldwide deflationary  pressures and in  particular acontinuing  decline in commodity prices,  even  since our last meeting.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank  you.  There are disparate  developments  in our District as wellas  all over the  country.  In particular,  directors  and others we talk to focus attention  on steel  andhow  hard times have been  for the steel  sector.  Twenty  years  ago when  I lived in  Pittsburgh,  oneof the  large corporations  headquartered  there was  among the largest in  the world--the UnitedStates  Steel Corporation.  They decided  they were  too dependent  on steel  so they diversified intooil.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That's how they  got there  in the first place!

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  So, we  do hear those stories  about just  how difficult it is for certaincompanies  and certain  communities  that are related to either metals  or energy.  But virtuallyeverything  else is  about as  strong as  it can get,  and everybody talks  about  1999 being evenstronger.  The motor  vehicle industry is exceptionally  strong.  Mike Moskow  mentioned Hondaand  Camry; they are both produced  in our District.  In fact, four of the top  six sellingautomobiles  are produced in  our District and three  of the top selling so-called  light trucks  areproduced in our District.  So, employment  in that industry  is strong and the  automobile producerswould like it to get  stronger if they could find the  workers.  Toyota  announced  last week thatthey  are going to develop  86 acres  in northern  Kentucky  across from Cincinnati  and build an12/22/98 38840,000  square foot facility,  and they are  going to import  the labor from somewhere.  Most ofthe communities  around the District talk  about importing labor from  someplace  else.Expectations  generally are that holiday  retail  sales will be excellent;  the malls  arepacked.  People are earning  good incomes and they are spending.  In banking, C&I loan demandis reported by one director to be the  strongest that he can recall  in the time he has been  in thebanking industry.  Bankers  have expressed  concern  about the continued overbuilding  of retailspace  and hotel and motel  space.  They  also worry  that depressed commodity prices  areeventually  going to depress farmland prices, but they continue to report that for the momentfarmland  prices  keep going up.  One  director with the construction  workers'  union  said that laborshortages  are going to  worsen in the  region in  1999 because of all of the new projects.  Onedirector in the asset  management business  reported that the equity market is being driven bywhat he calls "perpetual  great expectations,"  which  he considers  to be  unrealistic.  He voicedconcern  that company pension plans  and individual retirement plans have  been increasing theshare  allocated to equities  in recent months.  I have  seen--probably  everyone  has now seen--newsletters,  advisory  letters, talking heads on CNBC,  and so on saying that there  is no risk thatthe  stock market is going to go down  because  if it even  started down, the Fed  would ease  policyto prop it back up.  So, in their view,  the market can only  go  up from this point.  I think there  aremore  and more  people coming to that belief and acting on  it.One note in retail  distribution  that I found interesting  is that catalog  sales are reportedto be growing  at very rapid rates and that sales to corporations  for promotions and gifts areextremely  strong.  It was  noted that apparel  sales are now  the fourth  largest category  of Internetsales,  accounting  for 23 percent of total  sales on the Internet  and rising at double-digit  rates ofincrease, reported that his company  plans to raise  wages  10  to  1212/22/98 39percent  across the  board in 1999  in order to reduce their reliance  on temporary  workers  and tolower the  turnover of their work force.  And while  they are doing that, they plan to  invest heavilyin  labor-saving  equipment.Since the last meeting, I had an opportunity  to be  in a more tropical climate  thanCleveland.  Of course, Cleveland has  been  somewhat tropical this  year.  I had daily reminders  ofwhat somebody once said:  "Inflation  is like bananas.  Once  you start to see the brown  spots, it'stoo late."  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  A very soft report!

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  So, we  all look for signs and evidence that prices  of goods  andservices  are  starting to rise  at a  somewhat  more rapid rate.  There are some signs,  and the  staffforecast for the next year or two is that the rate  will be modestly higher.  But even if that forecastis accurate and prices of goods  and services rise  only moderately  faster in the next couple  ofyears,  low measured inflation  is a necessary but not a  sufficient condition  for monetary stability.We and others around  the  world have experienced  monetary  and financial instability andultimate economic  difficulties even during extended  periods when prices of goods  and serviceswere rising only very slowly.  So in  an important  sense,  stabilizing the dollar involves more thanjust wages  or prices of goods  and services.We all  know  that equity prices  cannot continue to rise at double-digit rates  as theyhave over the  last few  years.  Forecasting  an end to  that in one sense is easy.  There is no suchthing as:  The change  in the rate of change can increase indefinitely.  Inevitably, the rate ofincrease in equity prices  must slow,  and I would have been  happier in  that regard if we hadn'thad this recent very strong rebound in  equity prices from the  lows of last fall.  We  also know  thatthe  rates  of growth  of the whole constellation  of measures  of money  are  going to have to  slow.12/22/98 40They  have accelerated  dramatically;  they will  moderate.  Somehow,  someway, their growth  mustslow.  Either we'll get lucky and they will  slow or we'll take action to slow  them down.  Weknow the  growth of bank  credit  and all  of its components  cannot  continue  to rise at double-digitrates.  It must slow down,  sometime, someway.  We know that the rate  of increase  in real estateprices--house  prices,  commercial  real  estate prices,  and farm prices that have  all beenaccelerating--must  slow.  There must be a  deceleration,  a  negative second  difference.  So, weknow these things  are in our future.  It's just a matter  of when  and how we get  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  our District economy continues to chug along  at apretty  good pace.  We have  some weak areas,  and one of those, of course, is agriculture.  Theimpact is not as dramatic  as I mentioned  last time because  of the recent transfer payments  to thatsector.  The concern is the longer term.  We  don't know what the Freedom  to Farm Bill  willmean or  whether transfer  payments  will  have to increase  in the  future if these price  pressurescontinue.  That is  an  issue in  our part of the country.The other weak  area is energy.  Obviously, the low price  of oil  is hurting  our Districteconomy  right now,  although  we,  like others,  are  more diversified  now.  Of course,  mining,especially the coal  industry, is under a lot of pressure;  capacity  and price pressures  are quitedamaging to that industry  right now,  I am told.Conditions  in the  manufacturing  sector are  more  mixed in our region.  Activity  insome manufacturing  industries  is slowing  as a result of competition  with foreign,  especiallyAsian, products.  Our electronic  components  manufacturers  are  feeling some pressure.  On theother hand, our auto industry is  doing well  as are  some of our metals  manufacturers  that areexporting. They have  worked very hard  to increase their productivity and they probably  are12/22/98 41going to have their best year ever in some instances.  So, we  see mixed signals in  themanufacturing  sector.Of course, housing is strong  as  are services,  including retail.  Our banking  industry isquite active right now.  Our banks  are competing  very vigorously  for loans and they arecompeting on price.  They tell me their margins  are certainly narrowing as  a result.  We continueto  have tight labor markets.  There is some relief perhaps  around the edges  in some of themanufacturing  industries  that have  seen a slowdown.  But as  a general  principle,  labor marketsare  still very tight.As for the  national  outlook, I would describe  our view  as having come closer to thenotion that growth will  slow toward trend because  of two factors that are  not completelypredictable.  I think we will have  very strong domestic  demand  going forward.  We  have thecontinuing impact of recent rate cuts,  and M2 growth  is quite strong.  I think those portend astronger economy  and some future  upside  risks for the economy.  Obviously,  though,  capacityhas increased  in the economy  and that will help restrain  some of the  price increases.  We alsohave  the external  sector exerting  deflationary  pressures and we see many uncertainties  withsituations  like Brazil.  So balancing  out  those two effects,  I would say that growth  will comeback toward trend but that the  upside risks are  noticeable.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The SecondDistrict's  economy  has  generally shown  increasing signs  of strength in the past month.  Privatesector job growth  in both New York and New Jersey accelerated  modestly  in November.  Theunemployment  rate held steady  at 5.1  percent.  Purchasing  managers  when surveyed  say thatthey see some  strengthening  in manufacturing.  The purchasing  managers  also saw continued12/22/98 42brisk growth  in  the nonmanufacturing  sectors in  the month  of November.  Our part of thecountry  is really not very  dependent on trade  with Asia;  the trade  flows  are in  other directions.The retailers,  as in  most parts of the country, report  that sales  are below  plan, especially in  winterouterwear.  Manhattan's  office market,  which has been  very strong, is showing some  signs ofsoftening in the fourth quarter:  Office vacancy  rates  picked up a little in October  and  Novemberand price increases  slowed.  The purchase  prices for other commercial  properties  turned down.That is probably  very closely related  to the weakness  in  the financial  services  sector in the thirdquarter.We think the domestic  economy is  well balanced  and should grow  at about trend orslightly below  in  1999 and 2000.  This expected  slowdown is  likely to keep inflationarypressures under  control on the assumption that we will  maintain the present policy stance.Foreign  influences  are likely to continue negative,  with Brazil clearly the major danger  and onethat  is growing,  unfortunately.  Our policy actions this fall--our three reductions  in official  ratesand  the related though not coordinated  reduction  in interest rates  in Euroland--have  helpedreduce  the considerable  danger in fixed income markets.  The likelihood that both  the FederalReserve  and the European  Central Bank  will maintain official  interest  rates for the  early monthsif not a  bit longer next year is  a very  good background  for a  successful  introduction of the euro.And I think that will have a  somewhat  stabilizing  influence.  It is  much to  be hoped that thetransition  will go smoothly.  If it  does not, since it is  so much easier than the year 2000transition, I think it  would increase the  anxiety level  considerably for the Y2K change.The  New  York Reserve Bank's board,  which  had been very much in  favor of our policy easingactions  as indicated by voting twice for a  reduction  in the discount rate,  has  shifted its position,as I believe it should have.  Their thinking now is  that it is  very important for the Federal12/22/98 43Reserve  to show that it accomplished  what it sought to accomplish  and that further easing  actionsshould take place only if there is clear and new evidence  of weakness.I think the risks  are very  well balanced  now.  The  fixed income  markets have notcompletely  returned to normal  but I think we could expect, Brazil permitting, that they willprobably return  to somewhat  greater normalcy as  we  get past the  year-end  and into  1999.  Thedomestic  economy probably has a little more  threat--in a nice sense--of being stronger if left toits own  devices, but the  dangers  from the emerging  markets  are still sufficient  for me to view theoverall risks  as  very  well balanced.  To me that does encourage  us to maintain  the position ofwatchful waiting  as the appropriate  policy stance.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  the Greenbook  and most forecasts foresee  a  slowing inthe  U.S. economy.  I share that view  because,  after all,  as we've heard this morning,  themanufacturing  sector is slowing  and related to that net exports continue to deteriorate,  althoughwe hope the  rate of change  will decelerate.  Consumer savings  have gone  all  the way intonegative territory,  and for that and  other reasons consumption  seems sure to slow.  Investmenthas been on  a tear for a long time.  That seems  bound at  least to moderate to a more  normal pace.Profits  are already slowing,  which  implies risks to  the stock  market and an attendant  wealtheffect.  And so forth.However, what do we see going on  around us?  The fourth quarter of 1998  appears  tobe substantially  stronger than  we had earlier believed, giving the economy  a lot of momentumgoing into  1999.  Interest rates have  been  coming down  since our last meeting.  The effects  onthe real  economy of our earlier  rate reductions are  only beginning to  kick in.  The dollar  is a littleweaker, which  will be  stimulative if it continues,  as it is forecasted  to  do.  New job  creation12/22/98 44continues  to be  strong.  Unemployment  is actually  going lower it would appear.  Consumersentiment remains  high.  Retail  sales are  strong, particularly  in the cyclically  sensitive  areas likehousing  and autos.  With an  important possible exception of Brazil, which  many havementioned, foreign financial  pressures  on the real  economies  in many areas  seem to be easing atleast for now.  To date, there has  been  no great change  evident in the  pattern of inflation.All  in all,  Mr. Chairman,  at this moment  I am not at all clear in which direction  thenext policy move should  be, let alone  when it should occur.

MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Our job all  year has been to try tobring about a soft landing.  In the  first half of the year it looked  as if we might never have anylanding at all.  In the second  half of the year a crash landing  seemed more likely.  Now,  for oneof the first times this year, conditions  look about right.  One can take either the Greenbookforecast or the Blue Chip forecast  and it is hard  to write  down a better scenario  for a soft landing.In that sense, I  am relatively  comfortable  with the present  stance of policy.  There  are risks.Others  have  talked a lot about the risks  and I don't  have anything  in particular to add except thatit seems  that the risks will become  more evident over time and we will have time to act againstthem, provided that we are willing to  use monetary policy in a flexible way.Others  have talked about the money supply and  I don't have much  to add about thateither, except  to note that there  could be a variety of special  factors influencing the rapid  growthof the money  supply.  Those  who worry a lot about money  supply have  to admit that the moneysupply would have been  a particularly  poor guide to policy this year.  That doesn't mean  it willbe from now on, but if we  look at it in retrospect I think it would have been.12/22/98I would like  to take  the opportunity  to talk a bit about monetary  policy strategy and inparticular  about  a memo that we all get called "Monetary  Policy  Rules,"  which I hardly ever hearreferred to.  It  relates  to the Taylor Rule, which is actually  quite a favorite  among the academiceconomists.  I have  been  looking at that rather hard this  year and, in my view,  it has not been thathelpful.  For most of the year, if one looked at its various  predictions, it could have beeninterpreted  as arguing for higher  or lower interest rates, depending on how one  estimates theequation  and some other technicalities.  Now  it seems to be saying  that we should be raisinginterest rates  when one could make  a case that interest rates  are about right.  I think the problemhere is the output  gap term.  And the deeper problem is that to apply this rule, we must havepoint estimates  of our targets  for both inflation  and unemployment.  At the very best I think wehave  bands; we do not have  point estimates.As one listens to the way  all  of you talk about monetary  policy, you seem to havedifferent  approaches  to how to think about  it.  Suppose for the sake of argument that inflationand unemployment  are  reasonably within  their target bands  if not at one's point estimates.  Aslong as inflation is neither accelerating  nor decelerating,  we seem to be striving to maintainexisting  conditions.  Partly  this involves  watchful  waiting on acceleration  or deceleration,  notnecessarily  on inflation  as such  but on leading  indicators of inflation  such as  those on the outputside.  And in part this involves  aiming policy  so that future growth  in  aggregate  demand equalsthe trend growth in  aggregate  supply, which is roughly 2-1/2  percent  under most models.  At thelast meeting, I  said that the  trend growth  in aggregate  demand  was too low  and that the economyneeded some further  stimulus.  At this  meeting it looks  about right--at  least to me, maybe not tosome  others.  But I think that most of us have  this more informal  way  of keeping things  on an12/22/98 46even  keel for stable noninflationary  growth.  I believe this is  what most of us do  and I  think it isworking.  Thank  you.

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  In view  of the unusual constellation  ofreal  economic and  financial conditions,  both domestic  and international,  I believe  the outlook forthe economy  is "murky,"  which  I think is  the word Mike  Prell used.  I would say it's perhapseven  murkier than the staff presentation  might suggest.  The data released  in the  last few weeksdo indicate  that the economy  entered the final  quarter of 1998  with substantial,  and I thinkperhaps  even surprising,  forward momentum.  Real GDP growth was revised  up for the thirdquarter  and the Greenbook  shows that the staff forecast  for the fourth  quarter also has beenrevised up based on early  information.  As  Governor Gramlich  indicated, both the  staff forecastand broad consensus  forecasts show  significant abatement of this growth  in the early part of1999 with a bit of below  trend growth  and then returning to what is described  as a  soft landingwith low  inflation.As others have said, and it's a  view I endorse,  there are numerous  risks to this outlook.The downside risks are quite clear and  I will not repeat all  of them except to point out two.  Oneis that Japan's  economy is remarkably  weak and seems  to be experiencing  what I can onlydescribe as real  crowding  out in which their long-term  interest rates seem to be going up  as thegovernment  attempts to stimulate the  economy through  fiscal actions.  Secondly,  as ViceChairman McDonough  remarked, Europe is  about to enter a very  new  and interesting phase that Ithink is going to test their ability to have  the right amount of flexibility in  both monetary  policyand fiscal policy.  Thus far, they have shown  good flexibility with respect to monetary  policy,12/22/98 47but they may not have  as  much room  on the fiscal  side.  So, there  are  some risks becauseEurope's economy  seems to be  slowing somewhat.While  these downside risks  are real,  I am also concerned  about the upside  risks.Others  have mentioned  this.  As  President Boehne indicated,  the staff's scenario  is  plausible andmight even happen.  I certainly hope that it does.  But the  economy has  surprised us continuouslywith the  upside capabilities it has shown.  And next  year, we are  going to face  a situation inwhich there will be  a waning impact of the dollar's appreciation  and there may be some  surpriseswith respect to economic  growth  abroad.  And though oil prices  are  now low, there  is apossibility that they may turn  upward,  and that may undercut a bit the benefits  we have  had overthe last couple  of years.In this world of risks on both  sides--and I do believe  they are balanced--I  think thecurrent posture  of monetary policy is probably about correct.  If the inflation  forecasts  proveaccurate, we  can afford to adopt a wait-and-see  posture.  We have  shown  that we are  prepared tomove  quickly  and forcefully  to  offset downside concerns.  If it becomes necessary,  and  I don'tknow  that it will,  I hope we can move as  forcefully to  offset upside  risks.  For now, though,  mytwo watchwords  are "caution"  and "vigilance."  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Let me make  three general points  about the situation  we find ourselvesin  at year-end.  One is that the continued  sterling performance  of the U.S.  economy  is reallyremarkable,  and it is going to  be worthy  of some serious  scholarly  attention  for some time tocome.  A  year or two ago  the press,  economists  gathered  at meetings,  and even  the FOMC  werefull of talk about a possible  new era.  We  did not all endorse it, but we all talked about it.  Someof us were trying  to explain how  labor markets could remain  so tight without causing wage12/22/98 48inflation  to accelerate.  Others  were suggesting  that some combination  of the long heralded butunrealized  impact of information technology  on production plus  the new competitiveness  ofmanagement had put the U.S.  economy on a higher  productivity trend.Then  we all got  distracted by the worldwide economic  crisis  and our effort  to maintainour island of prosperity in the midst of global turmoil for the world's  sake as well  as our own.But while we  were  distracted, the  U.S. economy  continued  to chug along, pumping out goodsand services, making  better and better use of limited labor  supply, rewarding  skill with  wagesthat  provided incentives  to acquire  more skill, handing out bonuses to high performers,  but notshifting into the mode of general  wage inflation.  Moreover, good  productivity growth  continuedeven in  manufacturing  where  demand slackened  and payrolls  were falling.  The urge  tomodernize  and computerize  remained robust in  the face of macroeconomic  forecasts  that mighthave prompted  retrenchment in  earlier eras.  The U.S.  economy  really does seem to be workingbetter than it used to work.  It is more flexible;  it is less inflation  prone.  The good performanceis more remarkable  the longer it continues.Second point:  It is possible  that one  of the things we all  thought we  knew aboutmonetary policy  has to be unlearned, namely that  it operates  with very long lags.  Jack Guynnreferred to this in the opposite direction,  but I don't think he and I are saying anythinginconsistent.  He was  reminding us that the full effects of the policy moves of the last couple ofmonths have not yet  been felt,  something we would not have needed to be reminded of a fewyears ago.  We  would not have expected the effects  to be completely incorporated  yet.We used  to think that central  bankers  had to take big leaps  into  the dark because ourpolicy instrument,  while powerful  in the long run,  affected the economy  only over periods  of 6 to18  months or more.  But now we find ourselves  with a tool  that seems  to work faster.  Our12/22/98 49actions  in  September through November  are  credited with  strengthening--or  sometimes creditedwith  overheating--the  U.S.  economy  in the current quarter, not to mention the prospects for thefirst half of next year.  One reason is the  increased  importance  of equity markets  both infinancing  business expansion  and more importantly  in enhancing consumer wealth.  I think thewealth  effect is not  going to be temporary.  It will  only become more important  as  prosperity andlonger lifespans combine to increase  the portfolio  of the average  family.  That is not so true inEurope  yet, but it surely will be in the  coming decade  and elsewhere  around  the world as well.So, we have  to learn  to accept  wealth  impacts on consumer behavior  as an increasingly  importantaspect of the monetary equation.Another phenomenon  that has cut  the lags  is the growing importance  of consumercredit  and home  mortgages.  The ease of refinancing  home mortgages and home equity loansmakes  the transmission of monetary policy moves  into consumer behavior more direct  and faster.The growth  of global  equity flows and  sensitivity of global markets  to information  alsomagnifies  the effect of policy moves  by the world's important central  banks, namely us and thesoon to be created  ECB.  So,  we have a  hotter instrument  in our hands than  we used to have andwe had better  get used to  it.Third point:  The world is still  a scary place.  I won't argue  with the Greenbookforecast,  but I believe  we will  all  be lucky if it comes to pass.  While there are  some upside  risks,which  have been mentioned, it seems to me that the risks are mostly on  the downside.  There isBrazil,  which is  still  very uncertain.  There  is Russia,  where more chaos  is possible  and the worldcommunity  seems absolutely paralyzed  about what to do.  There  is Japan, where the worst maybe  over, but we have  said that a lot of times  before and the possibility of a  spiral of deflation  isalso  there.  And there  are countries  all around the world  that we have not focused on.  There  is12/22/98 50also an uneasy knowledge  that whatever blows  up next, the  turmoil will  spread rapidly throughworld markets  in  unpredictable  ways.  So, despite my optimism about the fundamentals  at home,I think we had better look carefully  for world trouble  and hope that we  know enough  to use  ourincreasingly  short-lagged  policy tool  appropriately  if we  have to.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Like most forecasters,  I responded to thedownward revision in  foreign growth  prospects  and the abrupt deterioration  in domestic  financialconditions  after midyear by revising  down my expectations  for U.S.  growth over  1999.  Unlikemost forecasters,  I was in the position  to ratify my earlier forecast  by participating  in monetarypolicy decisions  to lower the funds rate by 75 basis points.  I appreciate  being in  this uniqueposition.  [Laughter]But monetary policy  actions  have not been  the only developments  that have  supportedan upward revision to expectations  for growth  next year.  Three other  developments  are  of note.First, the  stronger-than-anticipated  growth in the second half, maintaining the continuous  patternof positive demand  surprises  over the past three years, is evidence  of continued  resilience  indemand and suggests  greater momentum  going forward  and upside  risks to the forecast  for nextyear.  Second,  the external drag from declining  net exports  appears to be diminishing faster thanexpected.  After subtracting more than 2 percentage  points  from growth in the first half, netexports  appear to be  subtracting only 1/2 percentage  point  in the second half.  Third, thedeterioration  of financial  conditions  that seemed  so worrisome a  short time ago  now appears  lessso.  The equity market correction has  simply disappeared.  While private  risk spreads  havewidened in the capital  markets,  the absolute level of private  borrowing  costs, weighted across12/22/98 51risk classes, is about what it was  at the  end of last year and only modestly above  lows  for theyear reached  at about midyear.On balance,  financial  conditions,  thanks in part to recent monetary  policy actions,continue to  be supportive  of growth  going  forward.  There are nevertheless  plausible  grounds  forprojecting  a slowing of growth.  The rationale for the slowdown  is well presented  in theGreenbook,  though it should be admitted  that virtually all the arguments,  including thedissipation  of the positive stimulus  from the wealth  effect, the  dissipation of accelerator  effects,etc., were  considerations  that underpinned  the projected slowdown  for 1998.On balance, I expect  growth  to slow to  about 2-1/4 percent  in 1999 and I see a  somewhatbetter balance now in  upside and downside risks.  I think the  upside risks principally  reflect theexperience  of continued positive demand  shocks that after some point make me  wonder what  wemight be missing about  the fundamentals  driving this expansion.  The downside risks have  beenwell discussed around this table.  They relate principally to Brazil,  to questions  about  thesustainability of current equity prices,  and to other pressure  spots  in the world economy.Let me note two upside risks relative  to the staff's inflation  forecast.  As  I have notedat recent  meetings,  I find the  Greenbook forecast of a  slowing  in nominal  wage growthsomewhat aggressive.  The risk here  can perhaps  be  seen by comparing the forecasts  for nominalwage change based  on  wage-price  and  wage-wage  versions of the Phillips  curve, twospecifications  that are routinely  tracked by the  staff.  The forecasts  for the  wage-pricespecification  point to a  slowing  of nominal wage changes  going forward--and  perhaps asignificant slowing--as  the response to the  recent decline in inflation  and the projected  modestrise in  the unemployment  rate dominate  the effect of the prevailing  low level  of theunemployment rate.  Some of the  wage-price  specifications  indicate  a slowing of as much as  a12/22/98 52percentage  point in  the rate of nominal  wage  gains in 1999.  On  the other hand, the forecastsfrom the wage-wage  specifications suggest a sizable increase  in  the pace of nominal wage gainsgoing forward.  Both of these specifications  have  yielded similar errors over the past four years,and they are now  generating forecasts  that differ by as much  as  1-1/2  percentage  points  over  1999.I think  this highlights the considerable  uncertainty about  inflation  going forward.Second, the Greenbook  allows for some diminution  in the  favorable factors that havebeen suppressing inflation:  a reversal  of declines  in oil prices;  some  further depreciation  of thedollar;  a reversal  of the  recent decline in  non-oil commodity prices;  and a faster pace of increasein  health care  and health  benefit costs.  The dissipation  of the contribution  from  these specialfactors is the basis  for the convergence  of actual to core inflation  in the Greenbook  forecast.  ButI am concerned that the projected rebounds in these components could result in somewhat higherinflation than  in the staff forecast  and that in addition there  is a particular  upside risk from  asharper-than-projected  depreciation  of the dollar.  Thank  you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We  are on  schedule for a change.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Mr. Kohn.[Coffee  break]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The  announcement  of your lasteasing  suggested that,  as a consequence,  the federal funds rate might bepositioned to sustain growth  and keep  inflation contained.  The incominginformation  since then could  be seen as  reinforcing that judgment,  at least fornow.  Economic  activity has been  stronger than expected  and the unemploymentrate  lower.  But moderation  in hourly earnings  and steep declines  in oil  andother  commodity prices  suggest that, even if the economy  operates  a bit furtherbeyond its long-run  potential  than anticipated at the last meeting,  any  increase in12/22/98pressures  on prices that might  develop  is likely to be quite  limited for a while.Such  a  shallow  upturn  would probably  offer the Committee  sufficient leeway  toreact in a timely  manner at a later date  should evidence  begin  to emerge that asustained  upward movement in  inflation  might be  coming.  In  addition,  changesin financial  conditions since  the last meeting,  on balance,  do not pointunambiguously to either greater  stimulus or greater restraint  on spending.  Yieldspreads  show mixed movements  over the intermeeting  period.  And while manylonger-term nominal interest  rates  are  down somewhat, rates  on indexedsecurities are  unchanged,  suggesting that  at least  a portion  of that decline  owesto decreases  in inflation expectations  rather than in  the real  cost of credit.While widespread  easing of monetary policy in Europe  and Asia shouldhelp to bolster demand,  that easing was  triggered in part by weaker  economicprospects,  at least in Europe.  In Latin America, Brazilian  problems have  madethe  situation,  if anything,  dicier over recent weeks.  The Greenbook  forecastsees  flat short-term  interest rates  here in the United  States as  consistent withmoderate  growth  and only  a limited uptick in  inflation, attributable mainly tothe  projected turnaround  in energy  prices.Against this background,  and with financial markets  even less liquid andmore volatile  than usual  ahead of this year-end,  the Committee may wish tokeep policy unchanged  at this meeting.  There  are,  to be sure,  substantial riskson both sides  of the moderate  growth  and  low inflation  outcome, which theCommittee will  need to weigh  as it considers  the tilt in  the directive  and as itmonitors  incoming information  over coming months.On the  side of a need to be especially alert to having to ease policy, thereare still ample reasons to worry about the  same  small-probability,  high-costevents that occupied  the Committee's  discussion in November.  As  Karen  noted,the ability  of Brazil to maintain  its exchange  rate regime  has, if anything,become more problematic.  While  the passage of time and slow  erosion ofconfidence in  that country's policies  undoubtedly have  allowed  counterpartiesand interested bystanders  to take anticipatory  protective  actions,  seriouscontagion  from a loss  of confidence  in Brazil  is  still a distinct possibility.  Indomestic  financial markets,  the backup  in risk and liquidity premiums  over thesecond half of the intermeeting  period highlights  the continuing heightenedsensitivity of these markets  to shifts in sentiment.  Greater resiliency maydevelop  after year-end,  when  participants  should feel more  willing to open theirbooks  to taking on risks.  Nonetheless,  markets  are likely to remain  vulnerableand  increased caution by lenders  would be a natural  reaction  to the  slowergrowth  in income  and lower profits expected in  most forecasts.Another source  of downside  risk is the potential  for inflation--or moreprecisely, inflation  expectations--to  drop further, perhaps  inappropriately raisingreal interest rates.  But making that determination  depends  importantly on thesource  of the  downward  surprise  in  prices.  Lower  inflation that resulted  from12/22/98unexpected  increases  in productivity  would be  associated  with higherequilibrium  real interest rates  because wealth  would be higher  and incentives  forcapital spending stronger.  Easing policy under those  conditions  as inflation  fellwould risk greater price pressures  down  the road.  Even declines  in  inflationfrom decreases  in the price of oil  and other imported  commodities  requirecareful judgment  about whether real rates  shouldn't be allowed  to rise.  Suchprice declines  can bolster real incomes  and spending, especially  if they  are notthe result of an appreciation  of the dollar.  But inflation  surprises from othersources--decreases  in  inflation  expectations  not associated with these factors  orunexpectedly  weak wage  growth--could  require the Committee to reduce  thenominal funds rate to avoid undesirable  increases in real interest rates.Finally, financial market participants  and many Wall Street  economistsapparently  see the risks to growth  and inflation  as tilted to the downside,  in thatthey have built further Federal Reserve  easing into the yield curve  and into theireconomic  forecasts.  Weakness  in a  number of the economists'  projectionscomes from  another potential  source of shortfall in  demand--a  squeeze  onprofits.  In these  forecasts, persistently weak profits  lower equity prices,impinging on consumption;  and  low profits, together  with developing capacityoverhangs,  depress business  investment.But the risks are  not all to one  side.  Aggregate demand  has been strong,and financial  conditions now may be no tighter--and  might even be a littleeasier--than  those of last summer and before.  And presumably  these are theconditions that have  contributed to the recent robust economic growth,  given thelags.  Investors  in bond markets have come  to discriminate  more carefullyamong borrowers,  but on average  yields  haven't changed  much, with increasesfor below-investment  grade credits balanced  by decreases  for many bettercredits.  As a consequence  of policy easing, the costs  of short-term credit  tomost businesses  appear to have decreased  despite higher spreads.  Forhouseholds,  mortgage  rates, which  are tied closely to Treasury  yields,  havefallen  appreciably.  In foreign exchange  markets,  the  dollar is lower than it wassix months  ago, potentially lessening  some of the restraining effects of foreigncompetition.  And not only has the stock market recovered previous  peaks,  butits resilience in the face of earnings  warnings  suggests  upside potential  forequity prices,  as Mike noted.  To be sure, current  financial  conditions  may notbe  so accommodative  as to keep real  growth  at 3-1/2  percent.  After all,  it tookcontinued  outsized increases in equity prices  over a number of years to producethis result.  Instead, the danger may be that these financial  conditions  will  slowgrowth  only to the rate of increase  in potential,  preserving the current  tautnessin  labor markets.  As  compared  with the staff forecast, this would raise the  oddson the emergence  of greater price pressures  when recovering economies  abroadfoster a turnaround  in resource prices  and a weakening  dollar.Interpreting the rapid  growth of money  may also help to assess  the degreeof risk that policy may be  too accommodative  to contain  inflationary  pressures.12/22/98Broad money growth,  which has been  strong  all  year,  accelerated  in the fourthquarter.  Growth  in M2 far exceeds the  likely rate of increase  of nominal GDP,and the resulting  decline in  velocity is much larger than can be explained  withstandard money demand  models.  This  suggests a lack of stability in  theunderlying  demand for money--one  of the necessary  conditions  for money to bea reliable  indicator.  Indeed,  some of the very recent  strength in  money  seems toowe to greater desires by households  for safe and liquid  assets, itselfsymptomatic  of problems  in financial  markets  that would damp aggregatedemand.  Such  an outward  shift in the  demand  for money would indicate  a needfor a greater  supply of money to support  any  given level of spending.  Thesesorts of considerations  would argue  against a close  linking of money growth  andcurrent or future  spending  or inflation.Yet, in  a very broad and imprecise  sense,  rapid money growth  through  thisyear may have  been indicative  that financial  conditions at least were  supportiveof continued  strength in aggregate  demand.  Positive  surprises in money growthhave been  associated with positive  surprises in spending, even  if the numericalrelationship between them has not been  close.  Moreover,  some of the overagein money  growth  relative to  the standard  models this year may reflect householdresponses  to  rising levels of wealth  and lower long-term interest rates--bothimportant  stimulants  to spending.  Finally, even the implications of the  surge inM2 and M3  growth late this year might not have  been  entirely negative for thefuture path of spending.  It did suggest the willingness  and capacity of a well-capitalized  banking system to  absorb flows of funds diverted from markets,cushioning the potential  impact of financial  market disruptions  on economicactivity.The staff, again,  is projecting a  substantial  slowing  in money  growth overthe months ahead.  This forecast  is predicated  on the  decelerating  path ofspending  in the  Greenbook  and on some reversal  of the flight to liquidity  andsafety of late  summer and early fall.  M2 growth  has moderated  in Novemberand, on  a partially projected basis,  in December  as  well.  If this  slowingfalters--if money growth remains  very rapid--it may connote  stronger thanexpected spending,  but it will  be important to examine  closely the reasons forthe overshoot.Whatever  your decision  on the symmetries  or asymmetries  of the policystance in the operating paragraph  of the directive, the Bluebook on pages  13  and14  presented three  alternatives  for the  associated language.  The first alternativeis the existing language;  the  second is the alternative presented in November;and the third is a modification  of that alternative  incorporating  the suggestionsmembers  made in November.  We offered  alternative two again because  overthe intermeeting  period  one of you  indicated a desire  to  consider retaining thedistinct from  the likely path of policy over the intermediate  run.  Also, in yourdiscussion of what is now alternative  three,  several of you,  including Governor12/22/98Kelley, President Broaddus  and others,  were of the view  that the directiveshould only reference the intermeeting  period and  not include the reference  to"in  coming months."  That remains  an open issue.We have  also included alternatives  for the  wording of the  sentence  on theprospective  growth of the monetary  aggregates, responding  to the discussioninitiated by President Poole at the last meeting.  That language  already had  adegree of flexibility, since it had been  the Committee's  practice to adapt it to fitthe staff's  forecast for money over coming  months.  And, in fact, it has  changedseveral  times this year.  We can continue to offer alternative  wording in  theBluebook for money growth  expectations,  as  we have done for this meeting.The  Committee might have different  projections  than the staff and,  even if itdidn't, it might want the  opportunity to  describe the  staff forecast  in differentwords  than  we suggest.Another option would be to drop that sentence  altogether from theoperating paragraph--a  suggestion  made  by President Guynn in September.  Thesentence  has  evolved over time from one that included specific  numericalranges for growth, whose violation could trigger  a policy response,  to thecurrent  vague expectation.  That evolution has paralleled  the Committee'sde-emphasis  of money in its policy deliberations.  The Committee now makesno attempt  to tie its annual ranges  for money to expected  or desired economicperformance  over the year, and the growth of money relative to its ranges playsno special  role in policy decisions, as  you have  repeatedly informed  theCongress.  As a result, the Congress  has displayed  no interest in  using thebehavior of money to guide its assessment  of the conduct  of policy.Consequently,  while  you  are cleaning up directive  language,  you might want toconsider deleting this sentence.  An  earlier paragraph  in the  directive  wouldcontinue to report  the Committee's long-run  ranges, consistent with therequirements  of the Federal  Reserve Act.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Incidentally, Don, when  are we scheduling  the nextsenior loan officer survey?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  It will be before  the February meeting.  We  will do the survey in themiddle of January  with the results coming in  during the week before  the February meeting.Preliminary results  are usually in the Greenbook  and the final results in the GreenbookSupplement.  So  you will have  the results  on the Friday before  your February  meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Other questions  for Don?  If not, I will  start off withsome comments  on developments  relating to policy.  I think all of you commented on the12/22/98 57continued  momentum in the  economy.  Even  the  labor market data, which appeared  to be weakor at least potentially  weak at the time of our November meeting, now  seem to have stabilized.While the gap between  the household  employment  figures and the payroll numbers,  which hascreated  a crucial  issue in labor market evaluations,  has not  yet closed, it has narrowed  as  aconsequence  of a very large increase  in estimated  household employment in  the latest survey.You also may recall that the  statistical  series that includes  the number of unemployed  plus thosenot in  the labor force  who would like to have  a job seemed to have flattened  during most of1998,  but it tilted down again in  the most recent data.  So, we see in effect  a reversion  to whatexisted earlier this  year, not only with respect  to a  number of financial  variables,  as Don Kohnmentioned, but  also with respect  to many of the characteristics  of the  labor market.What has  not changed in  any material  way is the seeming  lack of pricing  power in theeconomy.  I see  virtually nothing that suggests  upward pressure  on prices  despite the  ongoingweakness  in  profit margins  as  indicated by available  data for the fourth  quarter.  We see in thelatest estimates  of S&P 500 earnings per share  that the trend finally has  turned negative  for thefourth quarter.  Sales for the  S&P 500 firms  presumably have  not gone down in nominal  terms,but profit margins continue to decline.  In the manufacturing sector, the data show a continuationof rather strong productivity  gains and further declines  in unit labor costs, but they also show  awe are observing  is a remarkable  and, in fact, almost  surely unforecastable  economy that isexpanding  at a fairly rapid pace.  We also  see labor markets that, if anything,  are growingassume  that some  of you believe that this can go on for a considerable  period  of time.  I cannot12/22/98 58believe  it, but then again I  said that six  months ago.  [Laughter]  I guess  we should enjoy  it whileit lasts.As a number of you have indicated, the risks on both sides  have widened.  To a  verysubstantial extent  in my view,  the risks probably reflect  the extraordinary  behavior  of the equityis a very big factor in the continued  growth  of personal  consumption expenditures  and hence  infinal  demand,  seems to be attributable  almost entirely  in the last two or three  years to capitalgains increases  not only in the equity markets  but, as  I will explain  shortly, in housing  as well.If we  disaggregate  the household  sector, we end up with  a decline of a couplepercentage  points in the saving rate as a result of the wealth effect and another percentage  pointor so as a consequence  of higher capital  gains taxes.  As I recall, the  latter currently  are running  alittle more than $70 billion  per year according  to our estimates.  Their rise since  1993  has beenequivalent  to  1 percent  of the current  level of disposable income.  In  other words,  the capitalgains tax  accounts for a decline  of about  1 percentage  point in  the saving rate.  Anotherpercentage  point or so can be attributed  to significantly  flattened requirements for contributionsto defined benefit pension funds because  the equity holdings in such  funds  have appreciatedsubstantially.  If these  employee  contributions  had remained  about  the same as they were  in 1993in relation  to income and had gone up with the rise  in income,  that would have added  about  1percentage  point to the  saving rate.  So these factors  taken  together account  for most of the 5percentage  point decline in the saving rate in recent years.Superimposed  on all of that is the  very difficult problem  of estimating the effects  onthe  saving rate  of developments  in housing and in the process  avoiding  potential doublecounting.  There  has been a dramatic  increase  in sales of existing  homes.  Since the prices  of12/22/98 59homes  have been rising substantially  with  very few periods  of stabilization  or decline,  themoving average  of price increases  over the typical  holding period for a home,  which is abouteight or nine  years,  has  been positive  for an appreciable  period of time.  As  a consequence,realized gains associated  with the sales of homes have been  significant.  The increase inmortgage  debt that one can  attribute  to existing home sales  may be  derived by taking the netchange  in mortgage debt on single-family homes  and  subtracting from it the debt that one  wouldanticipate  if there were no turnover  of existing  homes--that  is, new  debt taken  out on new homesales less  scheduled amortization  on existing  mortgage debt.  The net of those  two subtractedfrom the  total outstanding  debt is  a reasonably  good estimate of the increase in debt on existinghomes.  That number looks  remarkably close  to independent  estimates  of capital gains  on thesale of homes.  The assumption  here is that that money is  extracted from the home market, whichof course  it is.  Obviously, part of mortgage debt is in the form  of home equity  loans, but themajor part occurs as  a  consequence  of the turnover from sales.  The seller of a home that hasappreciated in  value  gets back not only the  down  payment  and amortization  payments on thehome but the realized  capital  gain.  The latter  is largely reflected  in the higher mortgage debt,which  the buyer takes  out on the  home  relative to what the seller writes down.  As  aconsequence,  the  aggregate  amount of realized capital  gains in  housing and,  in a rough sense,  theamount of net debt on existing homes have  been  going up commensurately  with  the dramatic  risein  sales of existing homes.Theoretically,  one  can say  that if the cash  received by the seller is unencumbered,which of course it is, there is no reason why it will  not be used to make purchases.  Theeconomics  literature is consistent with  the view  that consumer spending  and cash flows  movehand in hand.  More specifically,  evidence  based on econometric  analysis  suggests  that about12/22/98 60half of the funds acquired  from windfall  cash  flows such  as realized  capital gains are spent.  Sorealized capital  gains  on homes,  even  if financed  through  an increase  in mortgage  debt, will havean influence  on personal  consumption expenditures.The trouble, unfortunately,  is  that the stock market and existing home  sales are notuncorrelated.  This  makes it difficult to form a judgment as  to whether  what we think is the stockequity wealth effect is really  in part the housing wealth effect.  The  reason this is important isthat when  the stock market declines,  if ever, it does not necessarily follow that the same  patternwill occur in existing  home sales.  As a consequence,  unless we are  able  to disaggregate  thewealth effects  that are involved--and  we are going to do some of that  analysis to get a sense  ofthose effects--the  forecast  of final domestic  demand in the next year or two will be a verycomplex  undertaking.The  conclusion I  draw from all  of this is that in addition  to income, capital  gains  havebecome a  very important  factor in  the overall behavior of final demand.  Obviously,  the importantissue here is  how we view the stock market outlook.  While  it is true that we are seeing earningsexpectations  fall  in the very  short run  and it is certainly the case that  security analysts  havedramatically  reduced their earnings  expectations for the  year  1998, they have not decreased  theirearnings expectations  for the  longer run.  As a consequence,  if their earnings  per share numbersfor five years  out have not changed materially,  the lowering  of estimates for the near termimplies  higher expected growth  rates of five-year  earnings.  This effectively explains  how thestock market can rise with  earnings  expectations falling.  The answer is:  They  are  not falling; it'slong-term  earnings that  are relevant  for stock prices,  not short-term  earnings.I don't know how all of this is going to turn out.  The presumption  that stock marketprices can continue  to grow  20 percent a  year seems  absurd, as  I think  some of you said, but so12/22/98 61do a lot of other things.  The presumption  that the market is going to level out is probably theleast unsupportable  position  and that presumption  is consistent with  the Greenbook's  predictedimpact  of the market  on personal  consumption expenditures.  There also has to be a non-negligible  probability  that the market could go down  very  substantially.  I'm not entirely  certainhow  we would respond to  that.  However,  I do know that  the presumption  we have  discussed  inthe  last year  or so that we can  effectively manage  a bubble is probably based on a  lack ofhumility.  As I've said before,  a bubble  is perceivable only in retrospect.I think uncertainties  on the financial  side are going to be increasingly  difficult for us tofactor into our policy deliberations  over the next year.  The reason is that,  as  Cathy Minehan  saidearlier today, the probabilities  have risen  quite substantially  on both sides.  What  we  observe intoday's economy is an extraordinary  momentum coming out of the  1993  and  more importantlythe  1995 period.  The  very substantial expansion of the  asset side of balance  sheets obviously  isaffecting capital  expenditures  as well as  personal  consumption expenditures.If the economy's performance  in 1999 essentially  replicates  the Greenbook  outlook,we  will be lucky  and fortunate indeed.  Knowing that this transcript will  be read five  years fromnow,  I suspect  that comment  will be perceived to be very precocious.  [Laughter]The bottom line on policy clearly is,  as far as I can see--and indeed as most of youhave  indicated--that  we  should stay where we are  because,  as Mike  Kelley said, it is not obviousin what  direction the next policy move should be.  I think  we moved very  effectively  during thefall.  I believe we broke  what was a dangerously  eroding  financial  situation.  In my view, wenow are  in the position,  having completed that episode, where  our policy is back to balance  andwe should be looking  to both  the upside  and the downside  in judging the  potential  direction  ofour next move.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, I interpret  that,  as I'm sure  youintended, as  a recommendation  for "B"  symmetric,  which  I heartily endorse.  As  far as luck goes,I am reminded of the  immortal words  of Lefty Grove:  "It  is better to be  lucky than good."  Inthat year, he  won 31  and lost 6.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I believe  our easing  of policy and the associated stocknext year or so, and for now I think we  should leave  the funds  rate at 4-3/4  percent.  Although  Ibelieve  the upside risks to growth,  at least in  terms of the rate  of growth  forecast  in theGreenbook,  are greater than those to the downside,  I can support a  symmetric directive  for thismeeting.  Do  you  want comments on the options?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I should have mentioned that.  Why don't  we concludethis policy discussion and afterwards  go back  to the directive  wording issue instead of taking thatup now.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Okay.  That's all I have for now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I,  too, support an  unchanged federal  funds rate.  But I want to talkabout looking further out into the future than just the current situation.  Mr. Chairman, youemphasized  what I regard  as indeed the key feature of our economic environment,  the lack ofany pricing power.  I think that comes from what are now, fortunately,  very, very deeplyembedded views  about price  stability or continuing  low inflation.  Back in  the  1970s  when firmswould raise prices,  other firms would use that as a  good excuse  to raise  their prices  also.  Now12/22/98 63when firms raise  prices,  other firms do not follow,  and the  original price increase  gets rolledback.  And understanding  that process,  firms  don't try it in the first place.  So we have a verydeeply embedded  environment  of low inflation.  I view that as  a great  strength in our situation.But I ask myself this question:  What would we  expect to observe  from a dose ofmonetary  stimulus in  an environment  with entrenched  expectations  of low inflation?  In otherwords,  the stimulus is not  going to flow through,  at least in the near term, to goods prices  but it isgoing to flow through  to  something else.  What I would expect  to see is that it would flowthrough to some combination  of asset prices  and output if it cannot flow through to  goods prices.I would note that M2 growth at roughly  9 percent is high but not explosive.  We arenot dealing with an explosive  situation  in money growth, but it is high.  So, it seems to me thatwhat  we have observed is fairly consistent with the picture  that I am drawing,  that the dose ofmoney growth  has been  flowing through  to higher-than-expected  output.  We certainly see it inconsumption;  we see it in investment.  The economy  as  a whole  is operating at a high level.  Wehave  seen it flow  through to many asset prices,  though not all.  This is consistent with the stock18  months and what has  been  going on with the high  money growth.  Certainly  the picture  withbond prices  is consistent.  Interest rates  have  gone  down a lot; bond prices have  gone up in thelast  18  months.  We have talked about house prices  and real  estate prices  more generally.  Hereagain,  the  rate of increase is not explosive, but there is no question  that it is  a change from whatwe had earlier  in the  1990s.  Some of this I think is a consistent  story that money creation  hasbeen  showing up in house prices  and apparently  even  in agricultural  land prices.  Despite theweakness  in current  farm  goods prices, agricultural  land prices  are  not plummeting.12/22/98There  are important exceptions to this hypothesis that I am offering.  Until the last fewmonths, the  dollar has tended  to be  strong rather than weak.  We have not seen  increases  inprices of foreign assets  relative to  the  dollar.  Certainly oil and other commodity prices  havegone down  sharply.  Oil is an  important asset that can be held in the ground;  it does not have tobe produced.  But I am persuaded that  the money growth that we  have seen  is showing up  moreor less as  we would expect in the economy  and that it explains  a great  deal of what we  see in thecurrent situation.Ned Gramlich  earlier talked  about the difficulties  of explaining the money growth thatwe've seen.  I  would like  to present an  analogy here.  Suppose we  saw a jump,  let's say, in theECI.  If we could explain that jump as  a consequence  of some anomalies  in the data or faultyseasonal  adjustment or something  like that, we might  feel comfortable  with the jump.  But if wecould not explain that jump, I think all of us around  this table would assume that,  lo and behold,we were  finally starting to see the results of the labor market pressures in that number.  So, thefact that we cannot explain in detail where  this money growth is coming from  or where it isshowing up is not a source  of comfort to me but a  source of concern.If it were not for the fact that a tightening  today  would be a very large shock to thewe are working  through the credit  market disturbance.  The  bond market is  functioning normallyagain; the number of new issues  is back more or less where it was.  But I do  believe that it isvery important that monetary policy be consistent  and predictable over time.  Therefore,  I  wouldnot favor a move today because it would be regarded as very,  very peculiar  in the light of whatwe have  done recently  and in the light of the expectations that we have established.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I can  agree with "no change"  today.  Even though Idisagreed with the funds  rate reduction  in November,  I would not reverse it as of today.  I don'tknow what is going to happen  in the future because  of the potential  for external  shocks fromBrazil  or Russia or elsewhere  that will influence  the way the  domestic and international  financialsome point that we start to raise  the level of the overnight interbank nominal rate in  order to slowthe growth  of money and credit.On the issue of pricing in goods  and services  markets, the area I would watch  verycarefully  is that  13  or  14 percent  of the economy  we call  the health  care  sector.  Significantupward pressures  are already emerging in that sector.  We also see prices being  raised, at  least inour region  of the  country, in a broad range of leisure  goods industries  including recreation,travel,  tourism, entertainment,  and restaurants.  So, I think that we  are  seeing the brown  spots.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  Mr. Chairman,  I concur with the  "no change"  and  a symmetricdirective.  I think the risks are  on both  sides,  but they are  of a somewhat  different nature.  Theupside  risks would probably emerge  gradually and  not surprise  us by their virulence.  Thedownside risks, I think, are  likely to be reflected  in big changes  if they materialize,  although  theprobability may be smaller.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Mr. Chairman,  I, too, endorse  your view of "B"  symmetric.  I alsoagree  with  Governor Rivlin that the risks are  likely to be somewhat different.  The downsiderisks, as they have over the  last year, seem to have  a low  probability of developing  but are likelyto be highly  visible if they do.  Actually,  I do slightly disagree  with her.  I think the  upside risks12/22/98 66are likely to sneak up on  us.  While  I don't think we will necessarily be behind the curve, I  dothink it will be  important to be very vigilant.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  They won't sneak  up on Jerry Jordan.  He  already has them factored in.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman,  I also favor  "no  change"  with a symmetric  directivetoday.  I think the  case for that has  been made  very well  around the table.  As I was  reflectingduring the break,  I was struck by the number of people  today who in the earlier go-aroundidentified  and quantified  the upside risks, certainly  to a greater degree  than was  the case  lasttime.  I would associate  myself with those  who  have encouraged  us to be  as ready to move  on theupside to tighten policy as  we were  very recently  to ease on the downside.  I  think such behaviorwould reinforce  and preserve  our credibility for the next rainy day.  But I  am very supportive  of"no  change"  and  a symmetric  directive today.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I support "B"  symmetric with  a little bit of agony.[Laughter]  I agree  with your description of the risks.  However, I do  want to emphasize,  as haveothers,  that we have  made progress  against inflation  but that our forecast  for 1999  showsinflation  edging up a little.  We all know it's because  of energy price increases,  but  I think it does12/22/98 67require careful  monitoring  since we  do not want to give up the  underlying  gains that  we havemade against inflation.I also want to  make a brief comment  about your description  of the earnings  forecastsby Wall  Street analysts, with  the  short-term earnings  forecasts  coming down but the  long-termforecasts  staying  where they were  before.  It reminds  me of my years  when I was  in privateindustry  and looked  at many,  many business  plans,  as I am  sure  you did as well.  The head of abusiness  would often come in  and say, "Earnings  this  first year are going  to be down,  but waituntil years two, three,  four, and five.  They are  going to  go right up!"  We called this the hockeystick approach  because  we saw  it so frequently.  So, I would be  very skeptical  about the forecaststhat the Wall  Street analysts are  making about  long-term profits.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  your recommendation  for no change  in  thefunds rate target and to retain the  symmetric  posture  for the policy directive.  I believe it issometimes  useful to think about  monetary policy in  terms of the  desired path for the  growth  ofoutput instead of the desired path for the funds rate.  The path of output for 1999 projected  in theGreenbook  seems  about ideal  to me.  It shows a  slowdown to below-trend  growth,  which  I thinkis very important,  and  some unwinding of the exceptional  tightness now in labor markets  butleaving plenty of room,  given the potential  downside  discontinuities  in the forecast.  This  meansthat no policy action is warranted  today and none would be warranted  when  and if the economyslows to  the projected  path.  Looking  beyond  that, if we do not get a realization  of those12/22/98 68downward discontinuities,  I am struck  by how brief the period of below-trend  growth is  in theforecast  and how  modest the shortfall  is relative  to potential  growth.  To me that means,  after weget a better sense  that we  have avoided these downward  discontinuities,  that we are  going tohave to be very vigilant  against potential upside risks to inflation going forward.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Can you top that, Tom Hoenig?

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I am  speechless!  But I'm going to say  a couple of things anyway.First, I support your recommendation  completely.  Without getting into bananas or agonizing,  Iwould caution us about how we look at the need for future  policy actions.  Here  I associatemyself a little with Bill  Poole.  I think we need to look at the actions  we take in terms  of therisks, especially  the risks  to the domestic  economy,  and the  systematic forces that are in play thatlead to the upside risks:  our policy easings,  the rapid monetary  growth,  strong domestic demand,and robust income growth.  I think those factors  do give us pronounced  upside risks.12/22/98On the  other side, the downside  risks, as  Governor Rivlin  said, are risks of shocks,which  are impossible  to forecast. I'd suggest that we consider not holding off too long on theunwinding of our recent  easing actions  as we worry  about  the downside  risks from shocks  thatmight occur but also might not occur.  So I want to  be thinking about  unwinding our earlieractions  unless  some real  shocks  emerge.

MR. BROADDUS.  I agree with your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman, not withagony--that  would be too  strong a term--but  with at least some sense of unease.  What Iespecially  agree with in your recommendation  is your statement  that we are now back  at thepoint of looking  at the risks  on both sides  of the equation.  My feeling is that they are nowprobably  skewed to the  upside.  I agree  with the  comments that Larry Meyer made  and Bill Pooleas well.  I am comfortable  with a symmetric  directive at this meeting but had you recommendedan  asymmetric  directive toward tightening,  I would have been  perfectly happy  with that as well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Okay.  Before we move  to an official  vote, let us nowgo back to the issue  of the directive  language.  Remember  that there are  two issues  to beresolved, presumably  finally, after our previous  discussions.  One involves  the question  of thedeletion  of the  phrase  "in coming  months,"  which  is the basic  distinction between  option  2 andoption  3.  The  other is  the  possible deletion  of the  sentence on  the growth  of the  money supply atthe very end of the  directive.  As I understand  it, on the basis  of our previous discussions,  there is12/22/98 70strong support for option  3 at this point.  Some members  of the  Committee  have  focused on thequestion  of deleting the language in the  middle of option 3  regarding  the months  ahead, I believe,and some  have raised  a question  about deleting the  money supply language.  It would be helpfulif we went around the table fairly  quickly to  get a  statement from  each  of you  on  those issues.  Itconclusion.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  May I ask  one question,  Mr. Chairman?  I was one who, just forlanguage  purposes,  wanted to drop the sentence:  "Any  potential  changes  in the federal  fundsrate...."  Some expressed  a concern that  one of the subtleties  of that  wording related  to yourauthority to act  on the Committee's  behalf between  meetings.  One  view  was that  dropping  thatsentence  somehow  might be interpreted  or perceived  as compromising  your authority betweenmeetings.  My  question  to you is:  Do you believe  that the deletion  of that sentence  in  any waycreates  a perception  of compromising  your authority?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I do not, mainly  because the members  around this tablesaid it  did not.  And that is the ultimate determination.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman, I like  option 3.  I agree  with the language  in themiddle sentence  that includes  both the coming months  and the intermeeting  period.  I would haveno  problem with  deleting the sentence  on  the money  supply but I certainly  would not  get into  anargument if we  left it in.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.12/22/98

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I think I would prefer  option  3, although  I don't feelstrongly about most of the  differences.  I would delete  the sentence Ed Boehne talked about  onpotential  changes in  the funds rate because  I view  it as more confusing than helpful.  I do feelrather strongly  about taking  out the "in  coming months"  phrase, which appears  in both versions,options  2 and 3.  I think it is  irrelevant because we  always  review our stance  of policy  at everymeeting.  "In coming months"  has no meaning and could easily be harmful in  the  sense that itmight appear to commit us  to a direction  for policy over whatever  period some people mightinterpret  as "in  coming months."  And our views on that could change quite radically.On the final  sentence  on the  monetary  aggregates,  I have no  strong feeling.  I don'tthink it is doing any  harm and the day may well  come, perhaps  soon, when we would be glad tohave  it in there.  So, I would leave it alone.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I would prefer  option 3  but, like Governor Kelley,I have  a rather strong preference  for taking  out that phrase  "in  coming months."  This is anoperating paragraph  that is supposed to focus on our plans  for the operating  instrument over theoperating period, which  is the  period until  the next meeting.  As a matter of logic  and clarity,  thatphrase just seems  to clutter  things up and could cause some  unnecessary confusion.With  regard to the money sentence,  I have  a preference  for leaving it in.  It  does notrefer to an operating  instrument.  However,  this is monetary  policy, and I would like to see areference  to money in  a statement  about monetary  policy.

MS.  RIVLIN.  I support  option  3  and taking out the "in  coming  months"  for the samereasons that  Governor Kelley and President Broaddus have  stated.  I have  a slight  preference  forgetting rid of the monetary aggregates  sentence,  but I don't feel  strongly about it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I, too, favor option  3.  I feel  very strongly  about taking  out "incoming months"  for the reasons  that Governor Kelley  and President Broaddus  stated earlier.  Asfor the M2  and M3  sentence,  it could  go or stay;  I don't have  a strong opinion.  But  sincemonetary  trends  do seem to  provide us with some  information, at least at the  present time,  onbalance  I come  down in  favor of keeping  it in.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  I  would delete the  sentence  in  question in option  2, thereby going  withoption  3.  I would actually  prefer to leave  in the phrase  "in  coming months"  in option 3.  It goesto the question of what we mean  by symmetry  and asymmetry.  Does it refer to the  intermeetingperiod  or is it a statement  about the balance  of risks that we  see that might influence  when  thenext move might occur  over some reasonable  forecast horizon?  I like the broader context.  Ithink that is what symmetry  or asymmetry means.  Most importantly,  it is not positioningourselves  for either the  intermeeting  period or the next move but to provide  some broaderconcept of how we see the balance of risks.With respect to the last  sentence,  I would prefer to delete it because I don't think it hasto do specifically  with the directive  itself.  It  could go  elsewhere  in any discussion  of theunderlying  forecast, but  I don't think it belongs  here.

MR. MOSKOW.  I will be  a purist on this, Mr. Chairman.  Since this is a directive, Ithink  the phrase  "in coming months"  should come out and the  last sentence should come  out too.I  don't feel  as strongly  about the last sentence as I do about the  phrase "in  coming months."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Are  you for option  3?

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  In  option  3  I would  take out "in  coming months"  for the same reasonthat President Moskow  indicated.  I also have a preference  for removing  the last sentence.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  I have  a slight preference  for option 2, but the consensus  seems tobe going toward  option 3.  So, I will  go with that  since it does what I think we need to do.  Withrespect  to the issue  of "in coming months,"  I would retain it for the reasons  that Governor Meyerindicated.  I would  also retain  the last sentence for much the  same reason.  The entire tone seemsto be  expectations  over a  foreseeable period  having to do with the  risks and also  with M2 and M3growth.12/22/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I am for option 3.  I would drop "in coming  months"  for the samereasons and with the  same degree  of conviction  that Governor  Kelley  expressed.  I  am practicallyindifferent  about the last sentence.  On balance, I  would probably  keep it in.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  atypically for me, I  am fairlyrelaxed  about the whole  thing.  [Laughter]  I have  a marginal  preference  for taking out the words"in coming months."  Perhaps  inconsistent with that, I would leave  the money sentence  in on thetheory  that to spend the next year of our lives having  knock-down,  drag-out  battles  with themonetarists  of the world is not worth the struggle.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman,  I would go  for option  3.  I would take out "in comingmonths"  because I  view this as  the operating  directive  that applies  until the next meeting.  Ibelieve  that a sense  of the longer-run  perspective  of the Committee can  be and is  given in  theminutes that are  released at the same time as the directive.  I feel strongly that the last sentencereferring  to M2 and M3 should come  out because I  believe  that in the interest  of accuracy  itshould reflect  what the role of money is in  the Committee's  deliberations.  I  also believe  that itcould serve  as a useful  policy device at some point.  If and when  money is regarded  as beingmore important in  our deliberations,  it can be put back in; and markets  are going to notice if weput it back in.  If there  is a change  in our view on this matter, then  it seems  to me  we would wanta way  to convey that.  And putting it back in would be a clear way  to convey  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So you are  taking it out?12/22/98

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I would take it out now  because in the interest  of accuracy it does notbelong  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MCTEER.  I'd go with option  3 and remove "in  coming months" for the reasonsGovernor  Kelley  gave.  I'd keep  the last sentence for the reasons Al  Broaddus  gave.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  I, too, favor option 3  and  would delete  the last sentence on theaggregates.  I would leave "in coming  months" in for the reason  Governor  Meyer articulated.  Iwould delete  the  last sentence for the reasons  that President Poole  referred to.  I hope that helpsin reaching  a consensus.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  We need a  debate between  Governors  Meyer and Kelley.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  I prefer option  3  and I'd delete the reference  to "in coming  months."My  first preference  would be  to keep  the  sentence  on money if it were read  and interpreted  byeverybody as  a true proviso clause:  If, for example, it meant that if money  growth does not slowdown as  currently indicated in that  sentence, we would change something.  But since we do  notuse  the sentence that  way, I think it has  to come  out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That covers  all the  speakers.  If you can  give theSecretariat just a minute  to assess  where the Committee  comes out on the wording--  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  The decision  is  so clear from that discussion!

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We  have  only been discussing  this for a year now.  I went to  NewZealand hoping that this  issue would be settled before I returned!  [Laughter]  Dave Lindsey  letme down.12/22/98

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  You are  going  to have to write the  minutessummarizing  this discussion.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We might just say:  "The Committee then turned  to the  directivelanguage.  At the end of the discussion...."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The vote is  unanimous in  favor of option  3.  There  aresmall majorities  in favor  of eliminating  the "months  ahead"  reference  and the "money  supply"sentence,  but the votes are  not overwhelming.  The three  of us  who were tabulating  thepreferences  during the discussion  get the same results,  so I assume  that our count is accurate.Unless  I hear  an objection,  we will  use that wording in the current directive.  Would you read thenew  wording  with the policy  the members  have endorsed,  namely "B"  symmetric.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, could I raise  a quick question?  Are  we going toreturn  at some point to the question  of when this  would be released?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  It's the next  item on  the  agenda.

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  The wording  is on page  14 of the Bluebook:  "To  promote theCommittee's  long-run  objectives  of price  stability and sustainable economic  growth, theCommittee in the immediate  future  seeks  conditions  in  reserve  markets  consistent  withmaintaining the federal  funds rate at an  average of around 4-3/4  percent.  In  view  of the evidencecurrently available,  the Committee believes  that prospective  developments  are  equally likely towarrant an increase  or a decrease  in the federal  funds rate  operating  objective during  theintermeeting  period."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We will  now go back to the old issue of disclosurepolicy.  A summary of our past discussions  and positions  on this  issue and  a proposed solutionhave  been written  out and I will proceed to read it.The Committee  has had two very productive  discussions this  year on disclosure issuesother than the tilt language,  at the June-July  meeting  and the September meeting.  However, theCommittee's views seem  to have evolved mainly into  two disparate positions,  both of whichhave presented  very cogent arguments  in their favor.  One  group,  a small  majority  of the  18governors and presidents,  supports:  (1) releasing the operating  paragraph of the directive,  whichincludes  the  tilt, immediately  after every FOMC  meeting;  (2) releasing  a brief announcementimmediately  after those  meetings  in  which  either  the policy  stance or the  tilt is changed;  and  (3)releasing  the  minutes  of the  meeting as  soon as feasible  after every FOMC  meeting, presumablya  couple of weeks earlier than now.Another group, a sizable  minority,  advocates  keeping the status  quo in  all theserespects.  That  is, the operating  paragraph  would continue  to be  released  along with the minutesafter the next meeting,  and immediate announcements  would routinely be made only  after policychanges.12/22/98Finally, two presidents  would drop the tilt entirely from the  operating paragraph.My impression  is that in general  the Committee's  views have become held  withincreasing  conviction  and have polarized into these  two main  groups.  As  Chairman of theCommittee I would strongly  urge that on a matter  like this  one, where  any change will beirrevocable  in practice,  the FOMC should not adopt  a reform based on a  narrow favorable vote,with a sizable  minority of the  governors  and presidents  strongly  opposed.  A small  shift in thevoting balance  toward status  quo  would not enable us to reverse policy any more than  a deathsentence is reversible  after being carried  out.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Wow!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Instead,  I would propose  a compromise  solution, whichwe can try out on an experimental  basis at least for the time being.  That  compromise,  which  Icontinue  its current practice  of releasing the  operating  paragraph  and minutes after the nextmeeting  but to expand  the coverage  of its  immediate  announcements  to include those instanceswhere,  even  when policy has been kept unchanged,  the Committee wants to communicate  to thepublic a  major shift in  its views about the  balance  of risks or the likely direction  of future policy.This announcement  would be reserved  for situations  in which  the consensus  of the Committeeclearly  has shifted significantly,  though  obviously not enough to change policy,  and in whichthem.  It would not  apply every time the  tilt was changed  where  these changes  in  the tiltencompass  only small shifts in  the center of gravity of Committee thinking  or where in  thecontext of incoming  data the  markets have already  surmised the  shift in Committee  thinking.12/22/98 79The  announcement  itself would not necessarily reference  the tilt but instead would concentrateon the change in  the Committee's assessment  of economic  prospects.For example,  under the compromise  we presumably  would have made an  immediateannouncement  after two FOMC meetings  this year when we did not change policy.  Animmediate  announcement  after the late March meeting  would have  indicated  that the Committeehad seen  a shift away from a situation  in which prospective  forces were  roughly offsetting to onein  which  the risks of greater inflation  seemed  apparent.  Such an announcement  would haveavoided  some confusion  over the intermeeting  period  as market participants  attempted tointerpret our remarks,  and an unauthorized  disclosure of the tilt occurred.An  immediate announcement  after the August meeting  would have conveyed  theCommittee's perception  of a change in  the risks from rising inflation  to a more balanced outlook.In  the event, as  you recall,  with  your agreement I revealed  the shift in  a speech at Berkeleyfollowing our Jackson Hole  discussion.  It would have  been better communicated,  in myjudgment,  with a Fed statement.  As was demonstrated  after the last FOMC meeting,  anannouncement  can  be used  to convey the message that the Committee  has changed its assessmentof risks, including  a  sense of the tilt, even  without the release  of the operating  paragraph.The compromise,  which is  suggested by Don  Kohn and which  I fully support, boilsdown to a commitment  at times of a major shift in the Committee's  sentiment to  take advantageof the  current disclosure policy  in which  the Committee has reserved  the right to make  anannouncement  in  the absence  of policy changes.  When the FOMC announced  its new disclosureprocedures in February  1995,  the  statement said in part that it would  "announce  each change  inthe stance of monetary  policy, including  intermeeting  changes,  the day  they are made.  When nochange  is made at a  meeting,  the Committee will normally just announce  when the meeting12/22/98 80ended and that  there are no further announcements.  However, in some infrequent circumstances,the Committee might decide  to issue a statement even  when no policy  action is taken."With respect  to the implementation  of this particular change in policy that is beingrecommended, because  the recommended compromise  represents an  implementation of theCommittee's  current policy with variations,  assuming that an informal  consensus  of theCommittee agrees  with the idea, I do not think that a  formal vote today would be needed.  Ishould point out that should  you concur with  the compromise, it would not foreclose  later shiftsin  procedures in either direction  based on our experience with this approach.  In  fact, I suspectour experience  might help us to reach a consensus.Finally, news of this approach  will get out when  the minutes of this meeting  arereleased  in early February,  and I could discuss it further in my February  Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony.  If so, these procedures  would be put in place  by the March  FOMC meeting.I would be most interested in comments.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Clarification,  Mr. Chairman.  I may not have listened carefully enoughbut I  am not clear:  Would this be a  statement from the Committee and would the statement  bereviewed  by the Committee  at the meeting  after  which it is to be released?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.  At the moment,  we now discuss our position  withrespect  to policy in terms  of alternatives A, B,  or C, and,  secondly, with respect to tilt.  When  itappears  appropriate,  there  would be a third  element in  the discussion,  which  would be astatement the Committee might  wish to make.  And that  statement  would be cleared  and editedby the Committee.12/22/98

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That process, Mr. Chairman, would be  approximately  the same onefollowed  when there are  policy changes  now.  That  is, you would read to the Committee  a draftof the proposed  statement and  ask for their comments.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That is correct;  that would  be my intention.  PresidentParry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I think  the compromise  proposal  you have  made makessome  sense.  To me it is a move in  the right direction.  As  I'm sure you  will recall,  I haveindicated  in the past that I would  like to see the directive  included in the  statement releasedimmediately after each  meeting.  But there is no question  that if we do that, we cannot  go back ifwe find that we  are  not comfortable  with  that in practice.  So to me at least, this is a  step in  adirection  that I think many of us wish  to go.  As  you indicated, if it looks  as though  we mightwant to go even further, we  will  have that alternative  available  at a  later point.  So  I view this asa reasonable compromise  and one  that I certainly can live  with.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman,  your proposal  is a compromise  that I  can heartilyendorse.  Indeed, I think I would argue that  it is better than either the status  quo or at this pointgoing to  the immediate  release of the operating paragraph.  As you know,  I  have been  anadvocate  of the  immediate release  of the  operating  paragraph in  general  and the decision  on thetilt in  particular.  But I  also agree  with  you that a change  like this should not be made  unlessthere is  a stronger  consensus than now exists.It seems to me that what your proposal  does is that it respects  the views of the majorityby  affording an opportunity  to make announcements  about symmetry  on those occasions  when itwould be most constructive.  In that  regard, this  approach  goes  a long way  toward fulfilling the12/22/98 82objectives that I have.  But it also respects  the views of the minority  by not making  a formalchange in the operational  procedures  that cannot be easily reversed.And, as  you also indicated,  there is a chance  to experiment.  Let's  see what happens.Let's  see how useful  in  practice these  announcements  are,  and let's also  get a feel  for the degreeto which  they affect  the  dynamics of our decisionmaking  and consensus-building.  Thediscussions we  have had around this table over the  last couple of meetings  have given me abetter appreciation  of the  potential costs  as well  as the likely benefits of an immediate  release.Given the uncertainty  about this balance,  I think your compromise  is a perfect  solution.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I think the compromise  makes  a lot of sense  as a way  to try out asimple recitation  of the reason why no policy change was made.  I have long felt that no  policychange is as much a decision  as a change in policy is--that there is  a policy content to  whateverwe do  at all  of our meetings.  At times  it could be  very useful,  as  you have  suggested, to  releasean explanatory  statement.  I think the  experience  we had with the  short statement  after our lastmeeting  gave us  an indication  that this could be quite positive in  terms of how  the market reactsto  what we are doing.  In  that case,  the statement  was made  in the context of a policy change.Still, it provided  a little explanation  of it, and that gives  us some  insight into how  a simplediscussion of the understandings  of the Committee beyond no policy change  would be reacted toin  the future.  So to me it is very  definitely a step well worth taking.I  also agree with your  view that making a major move in what we say  to the publicabout what we are  doing without full consensus, without everybody  buying in, could potentiallybe a  real problem  and that we could not go back.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.12/22/98

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I certainly  understand  the  dilemma we  face  and Iagree  that we  need to have  a  strong consensus  before  we make a fundamental  change.  I supposethis is  probably a  good step, but I'm not quite  as sure or confident  of that as  other people.  I thinkthere is some risk  that it could cause confusion  in the markets and for the public  generally.  Iguess I'm thinking of a  situation where  there is  no change in  basic  policy but where  we changethe tilt.  As  I understand it, sometimes  we would announce it and  sometimes  we would not; Idon't know what the  criteria will be and I think  there is going to be some head scratching  outthere about that.  I can certainly  support your  suggestion.  However, I think it would be  veryuseful  to have  a formal  commitment  that  a year from now we will revisit this issue  and evaluatein some  detail  how it has worked.  Then at that point we can  decide  whether it has been  a plus ora minus and  whether we  should go forward  or backwards.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think that will be  automatic.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I think  your suggestion is  an excellent  one.  Inpreparation  for this meeting  I did go back  and read the transcript  of the  discussion  we had on thisissue  at the July meeting.  It really was an  excellent  discussion, pointing  out the different  viewsthat people  had on this subject.  Since I am  one  of those who were in the minority, with  astrongly  held view,  I think this is  an excellent  next step to take.  We can  review it  after a  yearand  see what results  we've had  with it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, I  will go along with this suggestion  out of respect  forthe majority  view that I know exists and  also  your effort to try to resolve the issue.  But I do so12/22/98 84with considerable  trepidation.  For one thing,  I think it is going to put you particularly  as  well asthe rest  of the Committee in the position  of having  to make  some very difficult judgments  as towhen we  should make a  statement and when  we  should not.  More often than not, that isprobably going to be a very  close call.  The  second  observation  I would make is  that once westart this, no  statement immediately becomes  a statement.  Let us not kid ourselves  about makinga statement  occasionally.  We are going to be making a  statement at every meeting,  even  thosewhere  we make no actual  statement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If that happens,  this is a mistake.  I do not envisage thatas what this compromise  is.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  I believe that the market will come  to see  our lack of a statement  asindicating  that there  was essentially nothing going on  at the meeting  and that everything is justrolling along at wherever  it was perceived  to be before.  And I think  that is a  statement.  It willbe  an implied statement.I also  have  considerable  skepticism  about whether  we would have the ability to goback to the current  status  quo should that turn  out to be  desired.  I think President Parry hit it onthe  nose when  he said it was  a step in the right direction.  It is  a step!  [Laughter] It will clearlybe difficult to go backwards  should we subsequently,  for whatever reason, desire to do so.  But Iwill  go along  for the reasons  stated.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  Mr. Chairman, I  am quite strongly with the majority  and I  believe thatmore communication  to the public is better than  less.  I  view this  as a  step in  the right direction.I would like to know how we nominate  Don Kohn for the Nobel  Peace  Prize.  [Laughter]

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  it is  a good suggestion and I  am in favor of it.  I thinkwe  should learn  from it and then  decide if we need to do anything  differently  sometime in thefuture.  But I'm very comfortable  with it now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR.  FERGUSON.  Mr. Chairman,  I  support your suggestion.  I think we havediscovered  that the  markets  tend to work better when there is more information  as opposed  toless.  I think that the Committee  can in fact draft the kinds of statements  that are necessary  andthat this will be,  as  you observed,  an  important  learning  experience  for us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I believe this is  a step in a gooddirection  also and I have  confidence  in the Committee.  Actually, maybe  I have even  moreconfidence in  the Committee's  counselor.  In my  misspent youth I was  a student  of the OldTestament.  The wisest  man  in the  Old Testament  was not Solomon but  an advisor of Davidcalled Ahithophel.  The passage  is "and the counsel that Ahithophel  gave in  those days  was  as ifa man  were to speak  with God!" [Laughter]

Ihope that  we  all keep open minds and indeed do learn  from it.  At some appropriate  time we  canthen  weigh  the evidence  and decide  what we  want to do.  It may indeed turn out to be a goodstep; it may not be a good step.  But I think a learning  step is a  step in the right direction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Do  you want to speak again,  Jack?

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Yes, please, if I may.  Mr. Chairman,  I support the  compromiseprimarily  because it represents  more transparency  and more information.  I also want to identifywith Al Broaddus's comments.  This is not going to be without  risk and agony,  going back  to ourearlier discussion.  I would hope that the  small majority that favors the full  step can  continue towork with the rest of the Committee  and that  we can build a bigger  majority over time as  we gainexperience  with this.

I believe  Mike Kelley raised some  good, sobering  thoughts,  but I think  the  wayto deal  with  his concern  is to use this new tilt announcement  procedure  only in rarecircumstances.  In my view  that is how it should be done.
