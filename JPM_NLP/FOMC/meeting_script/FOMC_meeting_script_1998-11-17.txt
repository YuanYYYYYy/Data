CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Before  we get started I would just like to reflect  on thefact that it is Bill Dewald's  last meeting.  He is sitting over there seeing that we do  the rightthing, a struggle requiring  infinite patience  among  other things.  He  has been  the Director ofResearch  at the St. Louis Bank for six  years.  We will miss you, Bill, and hopefully yourreplacement  will do as good a job as  you have done.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Is applause  appropriate?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.  [Applause]  Who would  like to move to approvethe minutes  of the September  29 meeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  As you know,  in  two or three  of ourrecent meetings,  we have been contemplating  ways  to improve  a number of the procedures  thatwe use to  communicate  to the public.  We  seem to have reached a consensus  around this tablethat the wording  in the operational paragraph  of the directive  requires some revision.  We  haveconsidered  a number  of different versions,  and at this point I will call on David Lindsey tointroduce  today's  discussion by describing  the state of play  at the moment.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman,  beginning on  page  15  in the Bluebook for today'smeeting,  we list three options  for Committee consideration.  Option  1 is the traditional  language.Option  2, which  was included  in a  memorandum that  I wrote to the Committee  in earlyThere  are  optional  inclusions  of some  "furthers"  in options 2 and 3  that the Committee  may11/17/98wish  to consider.  The purpose of the latter  is to pick up the possibility that after the Committeehas moved at  a meeting, it may  wish to reflect that  fact in the wording  of the tilt sentence.  I haveindicated in the note on page  16  of the Bluebook how some presidents  and one  Board memberhave reacted  to the proposed addition  of a sentence in  Option 2 concerning potential  adjustmentsto policy during  an intermeeting  period.  I think I should turn  the discussion  of Option 3  over toPresident Minehan,  since it is her proposal.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I would like to apologize  to everyone  because  I really didn't meanto complicate needlessly  or in any event to extend  the discussion to yet another alternative.What I thought I was doing  in responding  to the request for possible  rewording  was to include  areference  to the  balance of risks  in the  paragraph.  On  the basis  of my notes  at the Septembermeeting, that was an idea that Tom Hoenig brought up  and that most of the members  appeared toendorse.  At least that is what my notes  say.  In  any event, the inclusion  of a reference  to theCommittee's  view of the balance of risks  is the major difference  in my alternative.I differentiate  between  the "tilt" and the "no tilt" language.  In  the "no tilt" language,there is an explicit reference  to the  Committee's  perception of risks  as being balanced  at least forthe intermeeting  period and a related belief that no change  or a slight upward  or downward movemight be equally likely.  In the  "tilt" language, the perceived  balance of risks is not explicitlymentioned but is implicit in the Committee's  adoption  of an upside  or a downside tilt.  Also, Iwould agree with Presidents  Boehne and Parry  and with Governor  Kelley with  regard to thedesirability of dropping the  next to last sentence  in Option 2 that starts with  "Any potentialchanges...."  I  don't think it is needed.  I don't have any pride of authorship,  but I do have  somewarm  and fuzzy feeling for the  idea of mentioning the balance of risks in the directive.11/17/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I never heard anybody  talk about risks  as "warm  andfuzzy."  [Laughter]  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Cathy, your alternative  wording  for a tilt in the directive  refers  toeconomic,  financial,  and monetary  developments;  that  is fine.  Option 2 talks  about prospectivedevelopments,  tilt or no tilt;  that is fine  as well.  I am agreeable  to talking  about risks, but your"no tilt"  sentence refers  to "risks to the economic  outlook."  That stopped me because it could beinterpreted  to mean  real growth rather than  "economic,  financial, and monetary developments."As we  saw very recently,  a variety of near-term risks may cause the  Committee to do somethingthat may not translate in  the view  of every outsider  as pertaining to the economic  outlook.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  My intention  was that  the  reference  to  the economic  outlook wouldbe modified  by the subsequent phrase  about changes  in "economic,  financial,  and monetaryconditions"  so that  the two  expressions  would be considered  to  be equivalent  in the context  ofthat  sentence.  But I  see the problem that you're  talking about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, I understand  the logic  of Option3, but  when we  talk about risks  to the  forecast, we  are engaging  in internal Fedspeak.  JerryJordan has picked up on the concern  I would have  about  mentioning risks in this context, namelythat the average  American  would conclude that we  thought economic  growth  was a risky  thing.In popular use, it is  a word that could get us into some  trouble.  So, I end up being  verycomfortable  with the alternative  language  of Option 2.  With  some  amendments  from TomHoenig to the earlier version,  that option captures  what we found reasonable  at the last meeting.  Ibelieve  that  even when  we have no tilt, we need the  disputed sentence,  "any  potential  changes  inthe federal  funds rate operating  objective  during  the intermeeting period  should be considered in11/17/98that context."  That sentence  makes it clearer that the Chairman  has the  power--in  fact there  is noquestion  about  that in my  view--and  the good will  of his colleagues  on the  Committee  so that ifcircumstances  in the intermeeting  period should indicate the desirability  of a change in policy, hecan implement the  change.  The courtesy  that you have shown  us, Mr. Chairman,  at least in  the5-1/2 years that I've been  sitting here, has  been such that  I don't think there's the slightest worrythat that power would not be used wisely  and well.  So, I think it's very important  that thesentence in question  be retained.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I think that either Option  2 or Option  3 would be asignificant improvement  over what  we have now.  For the reasons that Jerry  Jordan mentioned, Iwould have a preference  for Option  2.  In my view, it is a little  more compact and  a little clearer.I would agree with  those who feel  that we should remove the third sentence.  If we  do so, Iwould suggest  a change  at the end of the preceding  sentence.  Where  there is a reference  to "thefederal  funds rate in coming months,"  I would prefer  to see the words "in  coming months"changed  to  "in  the intermeeting  period."  That  would make the  period that we are talking about alittle more  explicit and definite.  Finally, if we can get  the language  changed,  I hope we  will  thenmove on to  the next and I think equally critical  question of whether  or not we will release thisinformation to  the public  shortly after the meeting  at which the directive is set.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I prefer  Option  2.  In  my view,  it captures what we have been  talkingabout around the table.  I would  drop the  sentence  beginning with  "Any potential  changes."  Myonly reason for suggesting  its deletion  is that I  think it is basically redundant,  though it issubstantively  harmless.  We need to have  a Chairman  who is fully effective.  A  fully effective11/17/98Chairman  needs  to be able to change  the federal  funds  rate between  meetings.  If dropping oradding  this sentence in  any way  affects that, I am for whichever  strengthens  the Chairman's  handto be fully effective.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I prefer  Option 2, and I  would like  to remove that  thirdsentence because I, too,  believe it is redundant. It  seems  to  me, though, that both  Options 2 and3  are a tremendous  improvement  over the wording  we have been using in recent  years.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stem.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I think Option 2  would be a distinct improvement  and I  favor that.  Ithink dropping that sentence  about "any potential changes"  is  probably  a good idea because  itseems redundant to me, but I don't feel  very strongly about it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I want to join what  seems to be the emerging consensus.  I, too, preferOption 2, and I would eliminate  the  sentence  in question.  I don't think it adds anything, andwhatever  is briefer and more  to the point is better.  I also would echo the view that it would bedesirable for us to move  at some point to the immediate release of this language  after ourmeetings.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I,  too, after thinking Cathy Minehan  was on the right track, am back toOption 2 because  it is simpler.  The subtleties  of the  sentence that is under  consideration  forremoval  had escaped me,  so I was in  favor of taking it out.  I still favor dropping it unless there issome  subtlety that can and  should be  conveyed.  But if it is that  subtle, and I have  been here 2-1/2years,  maybe  it really is unnecessary.11/17/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Mr. Chairman,  I think either  option would be an  improvementover what we currently have,  but I, too, have  a slight preference  for Option 2 mainly because  Ithink our discussion about risks is very internally focused.  On  the other hand, I hope we willplain English.  In my view, Option 2 does that quite nicely.  With respect to  the  added sentence, Iwill  follow what I think is the emerging  consensus  that it be  dropped,  though I don't feel  stronglyabout that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I favor Option  2,  and I agree  that the  sentence  about "any potentialchanges"  does not add to the clarity of the directive.  A new issue  that I would like to raiserelates to the last sentence of the directive concerning  M2 and M3.  I  would hope that we  wouldnot have  a ritual  expectation of slowing  monetary growth if we  do not in fact have such  anexpectation.  I think, for example, that slower growth  probably was not our expectation  in therecent  past.  So, I would hope that if we are  going to  have  this sentence in the directive, itactually  will reflect  the judgment  of the Committee  and not be just ritually inserted.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Do you mean  that you would refer to it as  a staffforecast  as distinct from a Committee  statement?

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  Perhaps, yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  We  actually were  using monetary growth  numbers  in that  sentenceearlier.  When  the  Committee downgraded  the monetary aggregates  further in  1993,  we  changedthe wording of that sentence to eliminate the numbers  and include  a qualitative  description.  Ourintent always  has been to provide  a qualitative description  that exactly describes  the staff forecast11/17/98over coming  months--not  always over  the next month or two but, for example, over the 6-monthhorizon that is currently  in the Bluebook.  Unfortunately, as  1998  has progressed we have beenhit with  continuing  upside  surprises in  relation  to our forecast.  So, we have been  somewhatembarrassed  by not having  the slowdown  that we  predicted.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  There  is a potential  problem here.  I agree  with Al Broaddus  that thefederal  funds language  should refer to the intermeeting period, but I think it's clear that thereference  to growth  in the monetary  aggregates  covers  more than the  intermeeting  period.  So,we should put in  some language  that has a  longer horizon for the aggregates.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, could I explain  why,  unlikesome others,  I feel as I do  on the Option  2 sentence  in question?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let's  first finish our discussion  of the money supplyissue.  Does  anybody else have  any views about how  to  handle that question?

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I think that President Poole is bringing up an  extraordinarily goodpoint.  It  is almost  an embarrassment  to use over and over a standard sentence  that  incorporatesan expectation  that can only sometimes be right.  If we  want to include this reference in  thedirective, we should adjust it to reflect changes in the  money growth forecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Does  anyone  have any further insights? I think thatraises  a quite unanswerable  question, but we do have  to resolve  it one  way or another.  It is  aproblem in  the  sense that if the contemplated  reserve conditions  are  constantly changing but arealways consistent with  some moderation  in the  growth of M2, it strikes  me that we are implyinga good deal more  about the extent  of our knowledge of how the system is  working than evidentlyis the case.11/17/98

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  In recent memory,  which includes  the last couple of years,  we havealtered the wording  in that sentence to  say  "consistent with moderate  growth  of M2 and M3 incoming  months" when  we thought  such growth  would continue  to be  moderate.  While  actualmonetary  growth has been  strong this year, we  have had  a persistent staff forecast  of moderationin the future.  So, the wording of that sentence  this year has continuously reflected  our staffforecast  of moderating growth.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It turned out that the sentence  was wrong, but thatwording was  not locked in.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Exactly.  It is not locked  in.  It just happens  to describe the staffforecast  over coming months.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  The choice should be "moderate"  or "some  moderation."

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  When it has been appropriate  in terms of our forecast,  we have  said"moderate."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think President Minehan  has the right answer.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That's a  good point.  At meetings  in the future, the Committee couldchoose  what the exact wording  will be.  The  Committee may want to do that henceforth.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is everyone  in agreement that  that is advisable?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chair, you have the floor on the other  sentence.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I just wanted to clarify  my view  on the "anypotential  changes"  sentence  and why it should be included in  the directive.  Those who say that itshould not be  there are  saying that it is redundant,  and for us around this table it is redundant.But we are not the only audience.  There is a  whole world  out there filled with Fed watchers  and11/17/98journalists. I  am firmly  persuaded that, however abnormal  it may appear, these outside observerswould read  the absence  of that  sentence right  after an intermeeting  easing of the funds rate  as anindication that the Federal  Open Market Committee  decided to take  a power away  from theChairman,  which  he traditionally  has  had.  I can assure  you that that's how it would beinterpreted.  That is not our intent, but our intent is not very  relevant.  That would be the way itwould be interpreted.  It would involve  us in a big brouhaha  about nothing.  If those who objectto the sentence think it is redundant, that's  a very small price  to pay to avert  a highly politicalevent  that would dismay all  of us.  I really encourage us not to do  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I  agree  with  the consensus  to  go with  Option 2. I think thesentence that President McDonough  is referring  to is redundant  and unnecessary.  I just wonderif there is some  other way to  deal with the problem  that you raise, Bill, which  is  a real problem.We might put out a statement when we notify the public about our future use of differentlanguage  in which  we would say that the rewording  does not reflect any change  in FederalReserve  policies.  It is just an effort to clarify  the meaning  of our directives.  That in fact isexactly what we are trying to do.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I think such clarifications  tend to get lost,  andthis problem  would be perpetuated  meeting after meeting.  In the effort to eliminate  redundancy,we really would be inviting a problem  that we  don't need to have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Would President Broaddus's recommendation  resolvethis?  One possibility is to combine the  sentences  to read in part "more  likely to warrant  [afurther]  increase/decrease  than [a further]  decrease/increase  in the federal  funds rate  in the11/17/98intermeeting period"  instead of "in coming  months."  It  might be an interesting way ofcombining the  sentences.

[SECTION]

MR.  FERGUSON.  May I speak to that point, Mr. Chairman?  I may be a minority ofone in thinking  that  your suggested  revision doesn't do  what we  need to do.  Okay, I  may bespeaking  for others!  As I read our use  of the  tilt, it covers  a longer period  than the specificintermeeting  period.  If we  collapse  the two,  we will leave a false  impression  that we arefocusing  only on the intermeeting  period as  opposed to indicating that we may end up adjustingpolicy in  a  given direction  over a longer period of time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Why don't we say  "in the  intermeeting period and incoming months?"  Would that do it?

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  That answers  my particular problem.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  The problem that  I have  with a longer time frame is that we reviewthe tilt sentence routinely  at every  meeting.  We may not come to  the same conclusion  frommeeting  to meeting, though  we tend to do so more  often than not.  In  any event, the tilt adoptedat  a given  meeting  is operative only in the  intermeeting period because  we  always  review  it at thenext meeting.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  That, I think, is the magic of the  originaldrafting.  It picked up the  "in  coming months,"  which  is  longer than  the  intermeeting period, butit gave  the Chairman  the power to adjust policy in the intermeeting period.  It explained with thegreatest clarity how we,  in fact, behave.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It is not power; it is authority.  Power  is irrelevant.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Agreed.  Correctly  stated.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.11/17/98

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman,  I found working  through  this issue  much  like eating thefirst raw  oyster I ever ate.  The more I chewed  on it, the bigger it got and the harder  it got toswallow.  [Laughter]  Our discussion  this morning has not made this issue  any easier toswallow.  I certainly  agree  with others  who say that  Option 2 is an improvement  over thelanguage  that we have today.  I came  to this meeting with  a preference, and I think I  still have it,for the language  in Cathy  Minehan's  option.  I say that because I think that adding a  reference  tothe risks to the outlook, although  that creates  some  ambiguity, avoids  what Option  2 seems toimply,  namely in the minds  of at least  some people  a  forecast  of the next policy move.  That maybe providing more information  than we really intend.  So, I  would be more  comfortable  withOption  3, but Option 2 would  be an improvement  over what we have today.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I am on record  as in  favor of taking out the  sentencethat has been  under discussion,  and that  is still  my preference.  I do agree that  the sentence  isredundant, but I  also think that  it would be confusing to the public.  Its subtleties  are rather deep.I have no problem  with  the sense that the  sentence  is attempting  to convey.  I certainly  agreewith  the Vice Chairman  that this Committee,  under your leadership,  does  not have  a problem inthis area at all.  But I find  the sentence  confusing,  and for that reason  I don't think it serves  uswell.  I also would like to repeat that I support the notion of changing the timing reference in theprevious  sentence from  "in  coming months"  to "in the intermeeting  period"  as suggested byPresident Broaddus.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  after listening to this discussion, I would mention firstthat I think the solution  that you  and Al  Broaddus  proposed  of placing  "intermeeting  period"  at11/17/98the  end of that  sentence  strikes me  as  a good suggestion.  I would then take out the sentence wehave  been talking  about.  I agree  with Governor Kelley  that it is confusing.  It  confused  me  and Ithink it will  confuse others.  The authority is clear in the previous  statement without thatadditional  sentence,  especially  if we put in a reference  to "intermeeting  period."

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  It becomes clear only  if you  put in"intermeeting  period."

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I agree  with that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  This becomes  a language question.  I  do concur,however, with the point that Governor  Kelley made that the previous  positions  taken by thisCommittee  are void as  of the next meeting.  In that sense,  we may continue  with a given tiltindefinitely,  but it does require renewal  every time we meet.  We give the Desk authority tomove only during  an intermeeting  period and without  any presumption  about further movesthereafter nor with authority  to anyone thereafter.  I don't know whether the  sentence solves theproblem, but Governor Gramlich  is going  to tell us whether it does.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  That is just what I was  going to do!  [Laughter]  First, I am forOption  2.  I was all  set to support  Bill McDonough  on keeping  the sentence in question just topoint out to the world that there could be changes  in the funds rate in the intermeeting  period.But I think your proposed insertion of "in the intermeeting  period and  the coming months"  in theprevious sentence  does that.  It makes  it clear, in Roger Ferguson's sense,  that we  are talkingabout symmetry  or asymmetry  into the future, but it also calls  attention  to the fact that therecould be  changes  in the  intermeeting period.  If that modifier is in the tilt sentence, then we canin my view take out the other sentence,  as Mike  Kelley  and Ed Boehne suggested.  So, I  am forOption 2,  adding  "in the intermeeting  period"  to the  sentence on the tilt and deleting  the next11/17/98sentence.  I also hope  that we will  get a chance  to discuss the issue  of immediate  release becauseI would favor the immediate  release of this  paragraph.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  I just wanted to weigh  in  on the time periodquestion.  I am fully in agreement with you and Governor  Kelley that we  should confine  the tiltsentence  to the intermeeting  period.  I changed  the language  in  my alternative  to be very  explicitabout that.  So,  I think the change that  you and  President Broaddus  have suggested--to  insert areference  to the intermeeting period  in the tilt or no tilt sentence--is  the right way to  go.  I alsofavor taking out the next sentence  and  then qualifying the reference to the aggregates  in the lastsentence  by  providing alternatives  such  as  "moderate/some  moderation"  to get the potentialrange  of growth  into  the discussion  of M2  and M3.  So, I could go with Option  2 the way  it hasbeen  revised today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  On  the sentence  relating to the tilt, I would like  to substitute "theintermeeting period"  for "in coming months"  and to delete  "in  coming months."  I do, though,want  to ask that the  staff think about that last sentence  on money  and the  aggregates.  The  onlything I  like about this  sentence is that the constant  repetition of some expected  moderation  is  asubtle acknowledgement  that growth  has been immoderate,  [laughter]  that we are  embarrassed,and that  we would like to do  something  about that.  However, I never  look at M3.  I look at themonetary base and to some  extent at MZM.  Once  upon a time,  we used the  expression"monetary aggregates."  I  would like the  staff to  think  about that and maybe  come back  to itwhen it refers to money.  What is it about money that we really  care about?11/17/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is a problem.  I feel  very uncomfortable  about  ourinability to  understand fully what the  monetary aggregates  are telling us.  I fear that  we aremissing something subtle,  something  we have not yet  grasped.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I forgot  to note that if we do eliminate that  sentence,there is  in my view an advantage  to referring to  "the  federal  funds rate operating  objective"instead of just to the  "federal  funds rate."  The  former is really what we deal  with.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Mike  Kelley has  given me  a note that I think  is to thepoint, namely that we have  made considerable  progress  today.  We are  not quite  there, but I thinkwe are now  down to  Option 2.  We are down  to  a couple of variations  of the  tilt sentence.  Weare down  to options  on how we  should handle the M2-M3  sentence.  Since we  are only fiveweeks  away from another meeting  and we have been dithering on this  for so long, delaying awe should be able to refine the  wording.  We are  quite close.  We could, if we wanted to, spendmore time  on this right  now,  but it is not worth it.  Let's get another draft and have  another roundof discussions.  We may at this point have  the equivalent  of a notation  vote in favor of a change.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  I  am happy to wait another month, but when  we reconsider thelanguage can  we  also have on the agenda  the issue of the immediate  release  of the operationalparagraph?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  see that as a  separate  issue.  I do think that we can andshould put it on the  agenda, but we  don't have to decide both questions the same  way.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  We cannot immediately release  something  we have not agreed  on.[Laughter]11/17/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I  acknowledge  that!  Let us put that issue on  the tableagain.  Hopefully,  we  will  get this wording  issue resolved  at the  next meeting  and perhaps  makeconsiderable  progress,  even  come  to a conclusion,  on the release issue.  President Poole.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I just wanted to emphasize  the release issue, too.  I  do not want to missthe discussion  of immediate release.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We finally got  through!  Peter Fisher.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  I am  going to be referringto a  package of colored  charts that you  should find in  front of you.1/  Myreport today will be in two parts.  First, I will  discuss  market  conditions  andreview  domestic  open market  operations,  answer your questions,  and  seekyour ratification  of our open market operations.  After that vote, I will seekyour approval  on the  two  special matters  identified in the  revised agenda.Turning to the  first page  of colored charts,  the top panel  shows forwardrate  agreements in  red for the United  States.  While the forward rates  havebacked up from the lows they reached in late October, both the 3-monthforward and the 9-month  forward  3-month rates  are still trading below 5percent.  The 9-month  forward rate is  still trading slightly below the3-month  forward rate.  This certainly  continues  to suggest a decidedlydownward  slope to interest rate expectations  here in  the United  States.Turning to Germany  and its forward rate  panel  in blue, I would makefour  points.  First, it is interesting  to note that German forward  rates brokebelow  the current 3-month rate following this Committee's  September 29observing  that rate cuts in  the periphery  of Euroland  had no impact  onGerman  interest rate expectations.  Indeed, the German rates have backed upgently  and consistently throughout a period of rate cuts by other Europeancountries.Third, much ado  has been made  of the political  pressure  on theBundesbank to lower rates following the  German  election, but we  do not seethat in the forward rates.  At least we  don't see any  downward or upwardmovement after the initial break  downward  in the forward rates followingthis  Committee's action.  I think there  unfortunately is  also a certain sense1 / Copies  of the charts  used by Mr. Fisher are appended  to the transcript.11/17/98of irony  in that political outbursts  may be  preventing both  the Bundesbankand  perhaps  the European  Central Bank  from making  a rate cut that theymight be inclined  to make absent the  political  outbursts.Finally, it is  worth noting that the German  9-month forward  rate  is alsotrading below  the 3-month  forward rate.  So,  there  still is a  decidedlydownward tilt to interest rate expectations  in  Germany.In the bottom panel  relating to Japan,  we can see the  rather steadytrading in a  clump of forward rates  around  and just below  the current3-month  rate, reflecting the Bank  of Japan's  policy of providing  ampleliquidity.  But these  narrow ranges,  I think, mask a number of otherdevelopments  in Japanese money markets.If you turn to the second page,  in the top panel,  you can see onemeasure  of the Japan  premium, which is expressed  here as  the spreadbetween the  3-month  Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi  $LIBOR rate, and  the$LIBOR rate fixing in  London.  You can  see  that the  spread is rising muchearlier this year than it did last year.  The real shock that occurred to theJapan premium last November  and into the  year-end followed  the bankclosings in Japan.  This year,  we see more of a persistent updrift from thesummer  through  the  fall, reflecting  I think the broadening  and nowgeneralized  negative sentiment  toward the Japanese  financial  sector and,more  recently this autumn,  the effects  of risk aversion  and credit  linecutbacks  to Japanese  banks by non-Japanese  banks.In  their search for alternative  sources of dollar funding,  the Japanesebanks have  turned away from the Eurodollar market  and toward the foreignexchange  swap market  where they buy  dollars and sell  yen  spot, andsimultaneously enter forward  contracts  to sell  dollars and  buy yen.  As  theJapanese  banks have swarmed  into  the  swap market  eager to swap  out ofyen  and into dollars,  implicit costs  of yen funding  have fallen  toward andthrough zero  for non-Japanese  banks,  as  you can  see in the bottom panel.Here,  the red line depicts  the 3-month yen  interbank borrowing rate inTokyo--the  average  borrowing  rate for Japanese  banks--and  the green line isthe implied yen  borrowing rate for non-Japanese  banks  taken  from theprevailing  spot-forward  swap  and $LIBOR rates,  assuming covered  interestrate parity.The extraordinary  movement into negative  territory  reflects at least twofactors.  There is reduced  demand for  yen funding  in general  in globalfinancial markets,  with the  general  delevering and the  unwinding  of thecarriage  rate that has been  abruptly occurring  throughout  the fall. There  alsois the  increased supply of yen  coming into the swap market  from Japanesebanks looking  for dollar funding.  These  two,  the demand/supply  nexus,11/17/98together caused the non-Japanese  banks  to express their reluctance  to takemore yen by posting zero or slightly negative  yen/LIBOR  rates at the fixingin London.Not depicted  here but occurring  simultaneously is another effect younon-Japanese  banks that  they now seek to invest to avoid credit  risk.  This isdriving  Japanese  Treasury bill rates toward and  through zero,  not at theauctions  but in secondary  market trading.Turning  to the top panel  of the next page, you can  see selected creditspreads in the U.S.  markets  depicted  in various  time slices:  first, at the timeof your last meeting;  second, just before the intermeeting  rate  cut;  and thirdon November  13  which  was last Friday.  The  table also shows the highs andthe lows for this year.  The simple observation  one can make  is that spreadsare down  from their highs  and from where they were in mid-October,  butthey are not  down  a great  deal.The more interesting  problem  in my view is that it is very hard to judgewhere  spreads  should be. I don't want to pretend that I have  any idea.  Ithink that  uncertainty is  a real  problem for the market.  Most people knowand understand that the highs  were somewhat  uncomfortable.  Most peopleunderstand that the lows of last  spring were probably unsustainable.  Butwhat that means in these rather risk averse  year-end funding markets  is thatthe market  as a whole has  yet  another  challenge of just trying to find a newequilibrium  for these various  credit products. That in itself is quite achallenge.In the bottom panel,  we have depicted  the spreads  between the top tierand second  tier for 90-day  and for 30-day commercial  paper,  with theformer  spread shown in  the blue line  and the latter in  the red line.  I shouldbe careful  to point out that these spreads  are based on  indices.  This panel,  inbrief, shows the more pronounced  than normal  year-end  effect we areexperiencing this year.  There usually is  some  year-end aversion  to A2/P2paper.  This  year it is  a bit more pronounced  than it has been in the past,reflecting the general  reluctance to hold the lower grade paper over thestatement period  at year-end.Turning to domestic  operations,  we  did not do quite as  well  as I  wouldhave liked  since your last  meeting in containing the fed funds rate  aroundthe  Committee's target.  So, I  thought this might be  a  useful time to showyou a little  about how  we assess our own performance.  On page 4 we havedepicted the  distribution of daily  observations  of one  standard deviation  ofthe fed funds trading  range and of the deviation  of the fed funds  effectiverates from the target.  On the  vertical axis,  we have  a measure  of volatility11/17/98expressed in  terms of the number of basis points of the trading rangecontained  in one  standard deviation.  On the horizontal  axis,  we havesimilarly  measured the negative  or positive divergence  of the daily effectiverate  from the  Committee's target, expressed  as  zero.  Each dot representsone  day.  The red  dots represent days  when we know  there is going to besome difficulty because  of high  payment flows, such  as  a quarter-end,  amonth-end,  a maintenance  or a  coupon settlement  date.  The blue days  areall other days.  The period here is for the year through the end  of July of thisyear.In the upper right-hand corner, you can see the little red dot for lastand one  standard deviation  of the trading range  was  almost 350 basis points.As you may recall,  that day was a rather volatile day.  Luckily  for us, mostof the other observations  are clustered  much  more  tightly around zero,which indicates  the Committee's target.  This cluster is depicted  on the nextwithin the constrained range of approximately  50  basis points.The two  small boxes drawn  on the  chart depict  the two  smallest areas inwhich we can  contain  25 percent  and 50 percent of the observations,respectively.  Luckily  for us and gratifyingly,  the 25 percent  box fallsexactly  plus or minus  1/16 percentage  point around the Committee's target,the  50 percent  box being of course  somewhat larger.  This gives  us somenotion  of the  norm for the calendar  year through the end of last July as acomparison  for how we have  done in the last few  months.On  the next page,  we show in the  same  constrained range the data frommore recent  period.  The hollow  dots are for the August  1 to  September 28subperiod and  the filled-in  dots for the  September 29 through  November  13subperiod.  The contents  of the two boxes are  summarized  in the lower left-hand corner of this chart.  You  can  see there that from  August  1 topercent box  and 58 percent  inside the 50 percent box.  Now,  this includedthe  period of late August and September  when there was considerablevolatility  and convulsion  in global  financial  markets,  but that disturbancedid not flow through to  the funds market.  However,  in the next period frompercent  of the  observations  fell  within the 25  percent box  and only 25percent  within the  50 percent  box.  It is rather hard to avoid the conclusionthat  the market conditions that have prevailed since  your last meetingindicate  at the very  least that we  have not lived up to our own standard  thatwe set during the prior year.11/17/98On  the next page,  there  is a  chart that I normally show  you to illustrateconditions  in  the federal  funds market.  In the top panel,  the green dashedline  is the Committee's  target, the blue vertical  lines represent  the federalfunds  trading range  on each  day,  the red horizontal  tick is the daily  effectiverate,  and  the red vertical  line shows  one standard  deviation of the fed fundstrading range.  In  the bottom panel, the blue bars  depict on the left-handscale the daily excess  reserves  we in  fact  provided to the banking system,and the red dots indicate  on the right-hand scale the  deviation  of the dailyeffective  federal  funds rate  from the target.Looking  at both of these panels at the same  time but focusing  on thetop panel,  two background  factors came  into play that I think are  useful foryou to note.  First, there  was a rather significant  shift of volume  into the  fedfunds  brokered market in  late September and October.  This  shift reflected  acutting back of credit lines and  a general  aversion  to risk in the term fundingaversion to lending money  at longer term and  over year-end,  and thatcreated  a reluctance  to post offers.  On the buying side,  there was  anaversion  to be seen  placing bids high enough  to attract the limited amount ofmoney  the other side  was willing to  sell--a reluctance  to post bids.  So,  wesaw a literal  thinning out of the  market,  with a paucity  of offers  and bids anda consequent  shift of both demand  and supply to the overnight  market.  Butthe rush of this volume into  the overnight  market  induced  the kinds  ofbehavior patterns  that contributed  to volatility.The  second  consistent background  factor during this period  was that themajor banks  that normally  would be  willing to act  as two-way  traders  tendedto hold on to funds through  most of the  day in this period.  They  werewilling  to sell those  funds late  in the day at very  low rates,  which  theyviewed as the  expected cost of minimizing the risk that they might have tocome  to the  discount  window.  This was true not only of banks that  weresubject  to rumors.  Discount window  aversion affected  the full range  ofdepository institutions.The first challenge we  faced  after the rate cut at the September  29meeting  was the month-  and quarter-end on September  30 when marketsusually  are quite tight.  You can  see that we had a wide trading range  and  afirm market on that  day.  We supplied reserves in  an  effort to lean againstthe market's firmness  on that day  and on subsequent days  when the firmnessseemed to carry  over.  The  resulting excess reserves  led to the soft  rates thatwere hard  to counter toward the  close of that period.During the second  maintenance  period, it was  widely assumed  that theintermeeting  announcement  of lower rates  at  3:15 p.m. on  October  15reflected an  abrupt action  to deal with  one or two troubled  institutions.  This11/17/98then caused  an  extreme  level of discount  window  aversion  over thesubsequent days,  particularly as  you can see in  the chart on October  16,  19,20, and 21.  We faced  a trading range that was consistently  above the target,the blue line, during the morning on those  days as  banks held  on to as manyreserves  as they could to avoid late day surprises  and  the risk that they mighthave  an overdraft  on their reserve  account.  Once  they reached  a comfortlevel  where they felt they  were not likely to see an  overdraft  at the end ofthe  day, they were  all  willing to sell their funds in the market at quite lowrates.  The surplus reserves we had been providing  to lean against theheightened rates then began  to show through.I should acknowledge  that during this period we were reluctant  to bestingy late in the period for fear that  a negative  miss on our part might spikethe funds rate upward or force a reluctant bank to the discount window.That would make it even  harder for us to  lower the rate to the intended  levelon subsequent  days.  We faced  similar difficulties  around the Octobermonth-end,  which  was in the next maintenance  period, but as you can see  onthe  chart market conditions  may now be stabilizing.  It is my hope that  wecan  do better, but I think, to be candid, that  we may continue to face anextreme  form  of discount  window  aversion  and  some volatility throughyear-end  and into January.Finally, I would like to discuss  a few  matters relating to our outrightoperations.  We have reduced  the size of our normal purchases  of Treasurycoupon securities  that we  do at  one time to about  $600 or $700 million.  Inthe relatively  illiquid conditions  we have seen,  going into the market forsmaller  and smaller  bites at any  given time means that we cause less andless disruption  in the  market.  I am quite  pleased that despite  the volatileconditions  we have experienced,  our operations have become  something of anon-event.  That  is precisely the  objective  toward which I have beenaspiring.A second item I want to mention--and  give  you an opportunity toexpress an  opinion,  if you  wish--is my intention  to purchase  inflation-indexed  securities in  our outright  operations.  We have not been purchasingsuch securities in the secondary  market.  We have been  acquiring them  atauction.  I know that when we  began  doing so, a couple  of members  of theCommittee expressed a degree of reluctance,  wondering why the  FederalReserve needed inflation  protection.  [Laughter]  I  would like  to be clear.We do not buy them because we need inflation protection.  We buy  thembecause  the Treasury  issues them.  The  general  asset class  involved in  allour purchases  is U.S.  government  credit.  As  the Treasury  has shrunk thesize  of its bill issues, we have not been  able  to purchase  bills in  the sameproportion  to coupon  securities  as  we  did in the  past.  We do not purchaseagency securities  outright.  We accept  them in repo,  and I have no particular11/17/98desire  to acquire  them on an outright  basis.  But if we  should have  the goodfortune to confront federal  government surpluses  going forward,  we aregoing to face the challenging  question  of finding new asset classes to add toSOMA  over time.  So, as long as the Treasury  is issuing  indexed  securities,  Ithink it is useful for us to buy them at least  in rough proportion  to theirissuance  by the  Treasury.I mention this because  as an  operational matter,  it doesn't make  anysense for us to purchase the indexed  issues at the  same time we're buyingthe regular coupon  securities.  We cannot judge  the relative  value of regularcoupons  and indexed  securities.  So, to make this operationally  practical,  Ipropose to go into the market and do a mini pass of the entire  index yieldcurve.  I suppose  we would  start out by purchasing  around  $300 to $500million.  I'm not entirely sure how much  we might purchase  in  a mini  passof the index yield curve.  For every $5  to $7  billion that  we purchased ofregular coupon securities,  we would periodically  conduct  one or two passesto buy a small tranche  of the  indexed  securities  benchmarked  against  eachother to  allow us to make some relative  value choices  about the prices thedealers were  showing  us.  But I  did not want to do this without informingyou  in advance  and giving  you an  opportunity  to express  your views on thesubject.Mr. Chairman, we  had no foreign  exchange  intervention  operationsduring the period.  I will  need the Committee's ratification of our domesticoperations.  I would be  happy to answer  any questions on  any aspect  of myreport, but I think our plan is to seek  a vote on the ratification and then  goon to the two  special  items.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I have observed that we are continuously  getting a glutof yen and a disinclination  to  hold them, but the oversupply does not seem to be spilling overinto the foreign exchange  markets in any  significant  way.  It is a fact that the total size of theBank  of Japan's balance  sheet is greatly  expanded,  and there  are very  large  amounts of yen  outthere that  somebody  has to hold.  Why doesn't that have  an impact on the  exchange rate?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  That is a  very good question,  and I wish  I had a  precise answer to it.  Ithink that it is important  to look at  the last two months.  I didn't talk  a lot about the big move inthe  dollar/yen  that  we had.  That was an  extraordinary  event, obviously,  in terms of the  standarddeviation  of the move.  It  was also an extraordinary  event in  terms of the factors  that came  into11/17/98play.  One major fund began  to move rapidly out of a series of positions  as has been  reported  inthe  markets.  Other  funds then had positions that  triggered--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  This was a  yen-carry  reversal?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  This was  the  unwinding of the  yen-carry  reversal  and  a move down  inthe dollar/yen.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  You just expressed that in terms of a double negative!

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Right!  I see the  big move  down in  the dollar/yen  as just a reflection  ofthe delevering.  That delevering  was  going on in many places,  and one place where it  showed upwas in the dollar/yen  exchange  rate.  The latter then triggered  a series of extraordinarymovements that  developed into a big technical move  down,  forgive the term.  In the generalback-up  of the dollar  against the  yen  in markets  dominated by considerable  uncertainty  andreluctance  to  take risks, I  think we  were seeing  precisely  the effect that I believe  you are trying  toexplain.  The  glut of yen  has been  spilling over gradually  and not in the shocking  way in  whichthe downward  move occurred.  But we are  getting a move back up in  the dollar.  The market  hasgone from  111  back to the  120-123  range.  If we were  not looking  at that against the  standard  ofa move from  124 down  to 111,  the  size of this move back up would seem  impressive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any other questions for Peter?  If not, President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Are  we discussing  the whole  range of topics,  including  the purchaseof indexed  securities?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  In a very important  sense, when  we buy Treasury  securities  weeffectively cancel  that part of the  government's debt.  The  word "monetize"  is used to  describethat result.  Wright Patman used to say that the  bonds owned by the  Federal Reserve  might as11/17/98well  be  burned because  the Treasury  gives  the Fed interest on those bonds,  and  for the most part,the Fed  gives the interest back to the Treasury.  Those bonds  do not exist in  an economic  senseany more.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  We didn't know  that there were no  bonds  in our portfolio!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Whatever  the Treasury's reasons  might be  for wanting  to increase  theoutstanding stock of index-linked  securities,  I would be troubled  if we were,  in effect,  toundertake  to cancel  some  of those securities  by monetizing  them.  As I understand it, a problemwith that  market has been its  illiquidity;  it is not a  market that has  developed breadth  and depth,and  all those  things.  For us to buy up some  of these securities  and remove them  from the marketwhen it is still in  its early  stages  of development  would be troubling,  so I think  we shouldproceed very  slowly and  carefully before  engaging in this activity.  And then there's the notionyou alluded to, regarding the public policy perception  of the central  bank buying  inflationprotection.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There is something  of a  "Catch-22"  about the liquidity issue.  I'mparticularly sensitive  to that issue because,  while  Wright Patman  was  free to have  his views, oneof the jobs the Committee  has assigned to me is to worry  about what  I would do  if I had to selllarge amounts  of securities  within  a short  period of time.  What  if I have to make  changes  to theSystem's  balance  sheet along the lines that we talked about a couple  of years  ago?  In thatcontext,  I feel I need to be  as  diversified  as  possible  among the  full range of assets that I amallowed to hold, so that  I will  have maximum flexibility in  the event that I have to shrink the sizeof the SOMA  portfolio to a  major extent.  We currently hold about 30 percent of the Treasurybills outstanding,  about  10 percent of the coupon issues  outstanding, and  5 percent  of theindex-linked  securities outstanding.  Now,  the share of Treasury bills  in SOMA has been11/17/98uncomfortable  as well,  continue buying  such large  amounts  of Treasury bills as to dry up thesupply in the public  market.  So,  I am constrained  on the bill side.On  the coupon  side, our operations  currently are  geared toward trying to smooth outour holdings  so we will have roughly  a  10 percent  share across  the coupon  spectrum.  Once wehave reached  a smooth distribution  across all  maturities,  then we will have to step up ourpurchases  of coupon  securities.  In my discussions with the dealers,  I tell  them that they areresponsible  for fostering  a deep,  liquid market; and, in turn, they suggest that  I also have  someresponsibility in that  regard.  Now, you may feel  that this is a camel's  nose  coming into the tentbut if the System, having purchased Treasury  indexed  securities  at auction,  were never topurchase them in outright operations,  the market would see that as a rather big black eye forthose securities.  But I'm not sure I want to be providing such  a negative  signal to the marketabout a type  of security  that the U.S. Treasury is  offering.Consistent with the spirit of your  concern,  President Jordan,  I want to proceed  verycarefully.  I certainly  have no intention  of holding a larger  share of the outstanding  indexed  debtthan I do of the regular coupon debt,  and I would move in that direction very  gradually  andepisodically.  However,  I have  a problem in terms of the  asset classes that I hold,  and I feel  someconstraint on  where I should go.  And as you  and I were  discussing  before the meeting, it willonly  get worse next year in the Y2K environment.  So I'm feeling somewhat hemmed in,  and ifpeople  have  alternative solutions  for me, I am all ears.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  You also should point out that  you are hemmed  in bythe constraint that you have to hold a certain  amount  of securities  on your balance  sheet in order11/17/98to implement  the directives  that  the Committee  gives  you.  Although I guess  you could buyfurniture!

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  You  would  have  to authorize  me to do that I think!  It  is a choice ofasset class.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  We could,  of course, unbalance  the budget to make it easier.[Laughter]  Peter, I was  already persuaded  that you  have a very hard job and that  you do it well,and this little  schematic  of how hard it has been recently  was  very persuasive.  However,  I didn'thear anything that could be of help to  you other than the possible reduction  in the  aversion ofdepository institutions  to utilizing  the discount window.  Is that the message,  or is  theresomething else that this Committee  ought to do to make it easier for you to hold the funds rate onits target?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  discount window  aversion  is probably  the message.  Don Kohnand  I have been working  for several  years with  the discount officers in the  System.  We havebeen  talking with money  center banks, trying to get them away from the discount windowaversion  that was  prominent in  the late  1980s  and  early  1990s.  We have seen all  our good workevaporate  in  a very short period of time.  The problem  is that the  people who  were the CFOseight  years ago  are now the chairmen  of the big banks.  So, they have been there  and it didn'ttake  much of a scratch  of the old wound to have  it all come back.  It will be interesting  to seewhether this is just a year-end  effect or we are  really  going to  see a new round  of discountwindow  aversion.11/17/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let's  go back to the TIPS  issue  for a moment.  You areoperating under authority  that has been  given to  you.  The  ability to choose  the classes of assetsin which  you invest is also  implicit in  those regulations.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The point that I  am raising is  that you have  theauthority  to buy TIPS,  unless the  Committee  decides to rescind  it.  Am I correct?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  absolutely.  There  is  going to be  a headline  effect:  When I enterthe market to do a coupon  pass exclusively for TIPS, it will  generate  a certain  amount of news.  Ihave the  authority to do this, but I didn't want to do it without informing  you in advance.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The  reason I raise the issue  is that if there is a verystrong predilection  that it is a bad idea, it is better that you know it beforehand.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That's  why I'm raising the issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Now is the time  to speak up if anyone has  a strongobjection.  Silence presupposes  acquiescence.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  It would make  a wonderful  column by  Alan Abelson.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I agree  with Jerry  Jordan that  it does  not matter, in  buying securities  atauction, whether the Treasury  is issuing conventional  bonds or TIPS.  In either case,  we are justtaking them off the market.  So, I don't think it's a good idea  to buy them  at auction  either.  Ithink TIPS  are  an experiment.  It has not been  under way  all that long, but I  am concerned  aboutthe message  that we might be sending to the market.  I think we might interfere  with theinformation  value  of these bonds if we're in the market, particularly  if we're in  the secondary11/17/98going  to come in  and at what price we are  going to come  in.  I want to leave that market  aloneand let it function  on its own.  The larger the amount of floating supply,  the more  likely it is to bea liquid  market.  So I am opposed to  dealing in these bonds  at all.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I have no  doubt that Peter has a  real problem  thatneeds  to be  worked on,  and I wish I had an  answer for him.  However, I very much identify withPresidents Jordan  and Poole  in that I would prefer to stay out of this market.  It seems to me,Peter, that given  the very small  size of these issues,  if you buy indexed  bonds in the sameproportion  that you buy regular bonds,  you  would be buying so few that you probably would notalleviate the problem  in this  market.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  If I can  first respond  a little further to President Poole, I then willaddress  your question,  Governor Kelley.  The Treasury knows in advance  what we are  going tobe buying.  They make the decision  regarding  the size of a floating supply they want to have.Part of their decision is  based on knowing what we will  tend to hold on  average  along with  arecognition that our securities  lending program  gives a little elasticity to the floating supply.  Bythe  way, I'm going to be coming to  the  Committee in  the near future to seek  some changes in  thelending program.The Treasury's  reaction to the question  of our participation  in  the first TIPS  auctionwas one of encouragement.  We wanted to participate  so that we  would have securities to  lendout, to provide elasticity  to the public supply as  a means of avoiding  the problems of squeezesand so forth.  We are not interfering with the Treasury's judgment  about what the floating  supplyshould be,  and I don't think we're going  to make a  big difference  in  the liquidity of the marketby buying $300 or $400 million periodically.  That is not going to be  a big issue.  However, it11/17/98already  is a big issue that we have  not bought any.  So  I see the  shoe as  being on the other foot,at least from  where I sit,  Governor Kelley.  Dealers are  asking  the Treasury,  and occasionallyme, why the Treasury  and the  Fed are not doing  more to  promote these securities  when theTreasury  requires  that dealers  bid on them  in auctions.  But I take  your point.  We can not makethis market  liquid  all by ourselves.  It's up to the  market to create  the liquidity.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  I guess  it's a new  notion to me that we would be promoting  the

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We are part of the U.S.  monetary  authority  and the largest holder ofU.S.  Treasuries.  The dealers view  our periodic  coupon  passes, through  which  we expand ourholdings  of securities,  as  a normal  part of our support for the Treasury  market.  And ourpurchases  are seen by the  dealers  as  a process  that thins out their inventories  of securities.

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman, I have just two  comments.  The  first is on the  issuethat is  on the table right now.  I understand  where  Peter is coming from, but I would feel  morecomfortable  if the TIPS  market  were  deeper;  with time it may become  deeper,  and in  that eventwe  would have less impact  on it.  I recognize  that Peter has had  discussions  with Treasuryofficials  and that this  may be  worked  out, but I certainly  would feel more  comfortable  if wewaited.On  the second point, I would like to come back to Governor Rivlin's  inquiry  about thediscount window.  This is not the time, but I know  that some  work has been  done on how  thediscount window  could be  put to  better use.  Some papers  were  written  and some  options wereexplored but not followed up.  I think there were  some  good suggestions  in those  papers thatcould make the discount  window  an instrument that the market  might be more comfortable  using11/17/98and in the process  help us smooth or reduce some  of that volatility in  the market.  I wouldencourage  us to revisit this matter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I agree  strongly with  Jerry Jordan, Bill Poole, and Mike  Kelley onthe TIPS  issue.  It seems  to me  that from a policy  standpoint the  great advantage  of this  market isthe possibility that it can give us a clearer read on inflation  and price level expectations  down  theroad.  We should not confuse  that  picture in any way,  so I would much  prefer to stay out of it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I  would like to applaud  what Tom Hoenig justsaid about finding ways  to make the use  of the discount window  a more normal  step in Americanbanking  circles.On  the TIPS  issue, it seems to me that by our inactivity in  the TIPS  market we havebeen  saying that indexed securities  somehow  are different  from other Treasury  securities.  Andour failure to treat  them like other government  securities  says either that  we do not approve  ofthem or that we are refraining  from buying them in order to  help them to become  a more reliablepredictor of inflation.  However, it seems to me that by treating  indexed securities  differently  andby not having our normal relationship  with the dealers in regard  to these  securities  we adverselyaffect the supply and demand  for indexed securities  relative to other  securities.  It would bebetter,  as a marginal  enhancement  to the liquidity  of the SOMA  and to have a balanced  view  ofU.S.  Treasury  securities  in  general,  to buy indexed securities  along the  lines  of the  very modestprogram  that Peter Fisher has  suggested than  not to buy  them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me just say that the ability  of these securities  togive a useful  view of long-term market inflation  expectations  is being significantly impaired by11/17/98what is undoubtedly  a very large  and variable illiquidity  premium  in these  markets.  Anyonelooking  at the  difference  between nominal  and  TIP yields  on 30-year  bonds and interpreting  it  asa forecast  of inflation expectations  would  find it very  difficult to explain how the difference  gotdown to 1.2  percent.  Surely,  no one would argue that the published  BLS  index is going  toaverage  1.2 percent over the next 30 years.  The difference between  a realistic  expectation of theyield spread, which clearly  should be more than  2 percent and probably  is closer  to 3 percent  orperhaps  even  more,  and the current  spread is indeed reflecting  an illiquidity effect  thatunfortunately  has been  changing quite dramatically  over the period.  So, I think the presumptionthat the difference in  yields  for those two  securities  is  very useful  as an inflation  indicator isdubious  at this point.  But I  do think the issue is  important, because  one of the reasons for sellingindexed  securities  is eventually  to achieve  a  useful  inflation indicator.  Reaching that goal comesdown to the question  of how to get  adequate  supply  and on-the-run  characteristics  that either willremove  the illiquidity premium  or stabilize  it in a form that would make the yields  on indexedsecurities  useful.  I  don't know where that comes out  with respect to the issue that Peter Fisher israising, but I think it is important  to recognize  that the indexed-securities  market has  a long  wayto go before  it will become  very  useful to us.  Governor Gramlich.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I think I support Peter Fisher and Bill McDonough  on that.  Ipolled the chairman  on this, but I couldn't quite tell where he  was coming  out.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If you can figure out where I stand, let me know![Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  I will not pretend that I know  much about New  York moneyinterpret their inflation signals.  Peter and Bill are  arguing that our present  behavior  has actually11/17/98distorted  the  market a little, and  I agree  with  them.  It is not that we would be taking  thesesecurities out  of the market.  It is that  we would be trying to make the TIPS market  function  likenormal  securities  markets.Let me also say something that I have  said before  on other aspects  of what we do.  Ifthis  does not work, we  can change it.  This is  not something  that we will be doing for all time.So, at least on an experimental  basis, it makes  sense to go along  with Peter, and so I wouldsupport it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I  want to go back  to the  issue of the volatility of the federal  funds rate,which  has been  mixed in with  the discussion  of indexed  bonds.  First of all,  I don't quiteunderstand the concern  over volatility.  There  are  simple  ways of reducing  volatility if we reallywant to do so.  For example,  we could post very narrow buying and selling rates,  perhaps  1/16percentage  point on either side  of the target rate.  It also would be perfectly  feasible to  eliminatevolatility completely,  although  there may be  very  good reasons for not doing it.  Second,  theDesk used to intervene  more frequently  during the  day, but it has ceased  doing that, probably  forgood reason.  More importantly, however,  I just don't think that  the volatility of the federal  fundsrate  should be  of much concern  to us.  Peter does  a good job with the  situation he  has, and weshould just accept that some  volatility is  inherent  in the way we choose to operate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I agree with that.  I  think the issue  should really be howaggressive the  Desk should be in  its operations.  The funds rates  that fall  out from  thoseoperations  are what the  market  is telling us,  and  volatility in funds rates is market  informationthat we  can very  readily suppress  if we wish.  I like  the little boxes  in Peter's  charts.  They arevery interesting, but I think there is  a question as  to what they tell  us.  President Minehan.11/17/98

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I want to  extend this  discussion  on volatility just  a little further.  Itotally  agree.  I think that volatility  has been  used in the  past as  an estimate  of whether the Deskis  doing a  good job  or not.  But I think it is useful to  see how much  volatility there is  and howhard it can  be on  some  days  for the Desk to achieve  the results  that it  wants;  it does  tell ussomething.  So I  don't regard that as  necessarily  a measure  of the Desk hitting its  strideoperationally  or not.  It is  useful to have  this  information,  and  I think it tells us a good deal aboutwhat has been  going  on in the fed  funds market,  and a good deal  about the  hesitancy  to use thediscount  window.  I agree with President Hoenig  and President McDonough  that we shouldreview  the use of the  discount window once  again,  but I must say that  as long as the media canlearn who is using the discount  window,  or make  guesses  that turn out to be reasonably  accurate,there is  going to be  a continuing  hesitancy  to use the discount window.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  think the alternative  is  to indicate  that only those ofsuperior moral fiber would have  access to the window.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  What test  are we  going to use for that?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Good question.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  With regard to indexed securities,  I  must say that I am  notenamored  with them.  I thought  that the decision  to begin issuing them just as we were  gettinginflation under control did not say anything very  positive  about economic  policy  in the UnitedStates.  However,  the fact is they  exist, and if we are  going to get any  useful  information  out ofthem,  we should treat  them  like other Treasury  securities.  So,  I am  in agreement with  PeterFisher's  suggestion.  Maybe  over time they  will be useful;  I have my doubts  but maybe.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Meyer.11/17/98

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  As  I listened  to the discussion on  TIPS  and SOMA,  I  was  strugglingwith  it for a while.  When  I heard  the Chairman's  remarks,  they seemed  to  summarize  my viewsjust perfectly  [laughter]  because  I wasn't quite sure  where  I would be.  Then  when I heardGovernor  Gramlich,  I thought  he really put  it together  very,  very well.  [Laughter]  On balance,  Ithink  that it makes  sense to  treat them like  other securities  and to allow  operations  in TIPS  aswell  as  other securities.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Just one other comment on  your comment, Mr.  Chairman, on theforecasting  usefulness  of TIPS.  I think it's important  to keep in  mind that we are  in  a period ofvery low  inflation and  very low inflation  expectations.  If we were to  move back into a  situationwhere there was  more inflation, I think we can  foresee  that indexed  securities would  be a  moreuseful forecasting  tool.  I guess,  Ned, if we are  doing these  operations  and  find ourselves in  asituation  where  we might want  to pull  back, I would  be concerned  that  it might  be  very difficultto  do so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  You are probably  right in the sense that the illiquiditypremium  almost surely does  not fluctuate  with the  inflation  premium.  As a  gross measure,  itmust  be useful to  some extent.  At this  point, I would  suggest that  there has been enoughdiscussion  about  the TIPS  issue,  and I think  it might be useful for David Lindsey  to make  a quicksurvey of everyone's  view on this  question  and provide  his survey results  to Peter Fisher to  givehim  a  sense of where  the Committee members  stand on the  issue.  Then, if Peter feels that hedoes not have  Committee  support, it will  be  up to him  to get on the telephone  and try to musterit.  I suggest  that we  try to  deal with this informally  and hopefully more expeditiously.  What  isyour deadline  on making  a decision,  Peter?11/17/98

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We will  be adding  a fair amount  permanently  to the System portfolioover the next 30 days.  It would be nice to make the purchases  in the  next 30  days,  but we willsee how it goes.  It is not vital.  I think you've made  a very good suggestion,  ChairmanGreenspan.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman,  could we  also get information from foreign  centralbanks?  After all,  the U.K. has been involved in  this a good bit longer than we have.  And we mayget some  useful information  from experience  abroad.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There are  very few foreign central  banks that have the kind ofpermanent portfolio  that we have.  There is also information from the  U.K. and other countriesabout their  experience  with inflation-indexed  securities.  I don't think it is going to be  aproposcentral bank operations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  When  I made reference  to the Committee a  little earlier,I was  really referring  to all  18  people around this table.  This is a long-term issue,  and on certainquestions  that go beyond  one year,  the views  of all  of us are important, not just the Committeemembers  at any  point in time.  Peter Fisher.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I need a  vote on my operations  during the  period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Would somebody  like to move approval?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So move.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I have  two other items, which  I hope can  go a little more quickly.First, I need  a vote authorizing  renewal  of our swap agreements  with the Bank  of Canada and theBank of Mexico.  By my silence  and your inaction,  all our other swap  arrangements  would lapse11/17/98as described  in Mr. Truman's memo and  my memo  to you of September  28.  This  is consistentwith  what we have  discussed  in recent  years.  Karen Johnson  is  working  with other central  banksto insure that the announcement  of this action  in the FOMC minutes  that will be released  shortlyafter the December meeting  will  be consistent  with  statements that  might be issued by othercentral  banks.  That issue is  still being worked  on.  With regard to the  second item,  I am seekingyour approval  of an amendment  to the Domestic  Authorization  to allow repo operations  of up  toa 60-day maturity.  This was explained in  my memo to you of November  10.  I would be happyto answer questions on either of those two  items.  I seek  your vote on both.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  On  the swaps, Peter, I would applaud  you and all the others whohave  worked very hard  to get to the point where we are  with most of these arrangements.  In  thememorandum  you  and Ted Truman  distributed  at the time of the last meeting, you  madereference  to  your intention to talk with  the Bank of Mexico  about their swap line.  Could youupdate  us on any  progress  on that?

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I had a  conversation  with a fairly  high-level  staff person at the Bankof Mexico.  They  are  still persuaded  that it is useful  for them to  have this swap line.  Theybelieve that the  market  sees  them in a  different  light from the other industrial central  banks.  Thelanguage  that we are  going to use, suggesting  that the  long period of disuse  and the changedcharacter  of international  financial  markets  makes  the swap lines no longer  necessary,  does notapply to Mexico.  They would  like this  swap arrangement  to continue.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  If I may add, our Canadian colleagues,  who face the  Quebec  issue atthis moment, feel  even more  acutely than the Mexicans  that this is not the time to let go of thoseswap lines.11/17/98

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I am not concerned  about the timing of not doing it now.  But Ijust  hope that  on our agenda  going forward  we  would always  listen to--

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We certainly have  that  in mind.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.  The presumption that  these  are truly balancedbilateral  swap  lines is clearly  false.  Swap lines are becoming  increasingly  obsolescent.  I wassurprised  at how successful  we were  in unwinding the  others.  I thought we  might have  a shot  atthese last two, but it turned out, for the  reasons  that Peter Fisher mentioned, that we weremistaken.  So we  still have  these two  lines, but hopefully  the two  other parties  will feelsufficiently comfortable  at some point to agree  to unwind them.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  if I could make  a comment.The Mexicans  are not  so much  interested in the  swap lines  per se.  They would like  to have theworld begin to  think of Mexico as  part of North  America,  not Latin  America,  and anything  thatappears  to foster that view is  very important to them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further  questions for Peter?  Would somebody  like  tomove approval  of the reciprocal  currency  arrangements  with Canada and Mexico?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Would somebody like  to move  theproposed change in the  authorization for  System repurchase  agreements?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  May  I ask a  question  about that?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Certainly.11/17/98

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I do not understand  to what extent the extension  of the repo  maturitiesis solving  a problem for the dealers  rather than solving a problem  for us.  I think  ourresponsibility is to  solve our own  problems  rather than the  dealers'  problems.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It is very  much about  solving a problem for  me, though the dealers  arecomfortable  with the notion,  so  in that  sense there  is reciprocity  here.  We had been  discussingthis long before  the emergence  of the credit  market conditions of the last two months.  We hadbeen thinking  about this particularly  in terms of Year 2000  problems when we expect  a ratherlarge increase in the demand for currency, which  we hope  will run  off rather quickly.  But it isalso something that Sandy Krieger  and I have talked about  for several  years  in terms of thedifficulty  that we  sometimes  have  in getting  collateral  for shorter maturity  RPs.  When we have ahard time getting collateral  for a large volume  of two- or three-day repos,  we often  find that thedealers are  willing to offer a lot of collateral  for 10-day  operations.  That has led us to believethat  it might be  worthwhile to try  to do  a 20-day  or 25-day repo to meet occasional  longer-termpeaks, and in  the case of the year-end,  maybe 30- or 45-day  RPs.  This would let us to lay  afoundation  by doing occasional  smaller operations  at longer maturities,  so that we would not beput in  a bind in  the infrequent  circumstances  when  we need to do a big operation for which wecannot get  enough short-term  collateral.  I want  to be  clear that it doesn't happen  very often  thatwe  get insufficient propositions  from the dealers,  but I think it should never happen and it is nota  situation I want to be in.  I am proposing  it now because  I want to practice  this year-end  beforeI come to year-end  1999.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  We should not be taking  any responsibility  for the term structure,  andthat is the advantage  of focusing  our operations  on the  very short  end.  I would not like to  see uspossibly  affect--or be  viewed as  affecting--the  term structure  even  in just this maturity  segment.11/17/98

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  First, I think it is  important that  we are working  in  the repo market,  notin the fed funds market.  There  are  very different dynamics  involved.  There  are different  supplyand  demand dynamics  for funds and securities.  Secondly, I do not think we  are going to affectthe term structure;  we are  price takers;  we do not set a price.  The dealers  know there  is riskinvolved if the Desk  does a  30- or 60-day operation  and there's an  FOMC meeting during thatinterval.  And they are  going to price  accordingly.  That also is relevant  to our outright openoperate  in  the repo  market.  The  dealers attempt to discover the  stopout rate,  but I don't want thatto be an issue  and  so we  don't publish  it.  Their estimates  of stopout rates reflect  only rumor  andgossip.  You are raising a  good issue, but I think we  are unlikely to affect the term  structure,  andwe certainly  have no desire  to  do so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is there  a  second to the repo  request?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let us move  on to Mike Prell  andKaren  Johnson.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Over the past couple ofweeks, participants  in  the financial markets  have become  less  certain thatthis meeting will bring another easing  step.  My  sense is that they continueto perceive  that you're  strongly committed to keeping  the economicexpansion  intact, but that they see recent developments  in  the markets  and inthe economy  as raising some  question  about at least the urgency  of furtherpolicy  action.The  sources of this uncertainty  about what you will  decide  to do havetheir parallels in  risks that we noted  in Greenbook.  While  our forecasthasn't changed  very  much from that presented at the  last meeting, thisdoesn't mean that we  have a great deal  of confidence  that this is what wouldtranspire  under the assumed policy.  We are  still confronted  with anuncomfortably broad range  of plausible outcomes.11/17/98For example, it's not  difficult to  imagine a  scenario in  which  the credithighs,  and aggregate  demand  barrels  along.  You  can  get a  sense  of whatthat might look like by blowing up the differential  between  the baseline  andthe "higher  stock prices"  simulation  in the  Greenbook, which involved  onlymaintenance  of last week's market  level.  On the other hand, it's just as easyto imagine  a scenario in  which there  is another significant  disturbance to  theworld economy and  financial system, perhaps  precipitated  by a "meltdown"in Brazil;  we have offered  a far from extreme  version  of this  in theGreenbook as  well.Karen  will have  something to  say about the  international  outlook  but,before that, I would like  to offer  a few comments  on  the forces currently  atwork domestically.First, the  fact that GDP growth  in  the third quarter apparentlyoutstripped  our expectations invites the conclusion  that we've once  againunderestimated  the momentum  of demand  in the economy.  However, theupside  surprise appears  to have been  pretty much  an inventory story.  In thatregard,  I should note that this morning's report on retail  inventories  showedthat, outside  of auto dealers,  stocks  were little changed in  September--probably implying  only a marginal  downward revision  to  our third-quarterguess.  As we said in the  Greenbook,  we don't think that there is  a majoroverhang  of unwanted stocks  in the  aggregate;  but inventory-sales  ratioshave climbed,  and  they are quite high in a  few industries.  At  a minimum, Ibelieve  we  should anticipate  that businesses,  at least  outside the  auto sector,will  be  attempting to curb  the pace  of accumulation.  That may well be onereason  why the tenor of news  from the manufacturing  sector has been  quitenegative  of late.Over the past couple  of years,  we've often  underestimated  the desire ofbusinesses  to maintain  rapid rates of inventory  accumulation,  basicallybecause  we underestimated  the strength  of final demand.  But, recently,domestic  final demand  has not been any  stronger than we  anticipated;  itwasn't in the third quarter, and last Friday's  figures  showing  a hefty  Octoberadvance  in retail  sales were closely in  line with our expectations.  Moreover,the  greater  growth of output  evidently has  not generated  any extra jobs  andlabor income.  Instead,  payroll  growth has  slowed more than we  expected,and there  seems to be  some pickup in corporate  downsizing  announcements.This may be  one reason  why  the early  November Michigan  SRC  survey--while  showing a considerable  bounceback in the  sentiment index--didn'tshow  much improvement  in employment expectations.The flip side of the more  moderate  growth  of labor income may havebeen  a shade  healthier  corporate profit performance  than we anticipated.11/17/98But the  trend of profits  is still weak  over the past several  quarters  and,though hope springs eternal in the stock market, the deterioration incorporate  cash flow is  a negative  for capital  spending.  The  anecdotalevidence  suggests that, whether for that reason or simply because  they don'tsee  current  and prospective demand  warranting  further additions  to capacity,many firms--especially  manufacturers--are  gearing  back their investmentprograms.I've not mentioned the developments  in the  debt and equity markets,per se, in my comments  on the  spending picture.  The jury is still  out onwhether  the recent  turmoil is  going to leave  a substantial  mark on the realeconomy.  On the credit side, the  bond markets  have reopened  for businessin  terms of new  issuance activity,  and spreads  are  narrowing.  Thecommercial  paper market is having  some difficulty accommodating  theover-the-year-end  borrowing by firms  that are  not in the top credit  rungs, butbanks  are  filling in--sometimes reluctantly--and  those tensions  presumablywill be behind  us in a  couple of months.Nonetheless,  we  still think it's reasonable to  anticipate that  it will take  awhile for the sting of the recent experience  to wear off fully, and that thecapital markets  will continue  to show  a greater  sensitivity to liquidity andcredit  risk considerations.  The  commercial  banks  are not insulated from thecapital  markets, and they too have learned something  about the risks facingthem in their lending activities;  consequently,  we  don't expect the recenttightening  of loan terms and  standards  to be reversed  immediately.  And,although the decline in  the level of interest  rates for prime borrowers,supported by the Fed's easing, takes some of the bite out of this  tightening,credit terms overall  have deteriorated  for some  higher risk enterprises  andcertainly the trend toward ever easier  access  to credit has been halted.Similarly, despite the  rousing rally that has  occurred  in recent weeks  inthe stock  market, unless that rise continues  we  also should see the impetusfrom wealth  effects waning in the coming months.  As we indicated  in theGreenbook, this is a real wild card in the outlook.  We believe that thecontext, our prediction of a  10 percent price  decline might  even be said to beconservative,  as it would leave the averages  considerably  above their recentlows.  But tell  that to an  investor who has once  again seen  demonstrated  thevirtues of buying on dips  and who hears market  gurus chanting the mantrathat "you  don't fight the Fed."  And one might ask what earnings  have to dowith share prices,  anyway, when  any company  with "dot com"  can  generatea huge market capitalization  overnight  on  a base of nothing but losses.In sum, while we  believe you  should view  financial  conditions  ashaving  shifted in a  less  accommodative direction  since  August,  this clearly11/17/98is a  situation  that will have  to be  monitored  closely in the  coming weeks.We're dealing with volatile  phenomena, the implications  of which can bedifficult  to judge.In any event,  even  if we have  the aggregate  demand  outlook right,  thatstill leaves  considerable  uncertainty  about the prospects  for inflation.Recent news has been  quite ambiguous  on this score.  The ECI for the thirdquarter, on the face  of it, raised some  serious questions regarding ourforecast  of a peaking  in  wage and compensation  increases,  but it wasfollowed by  hints of a moderation  in the  trend of average  hourly  earnings.Among the major price indexes,  with an increase  of two-tenths  last monththe year-on-year  change  in the core  CPI dropped  back to 2.3  percent--not  farabove its low point.  However,  the chain price  index  for GDP apparentlydollar  suggests that the prices of imports may not continue  to exert  so greata disinflationary  effect, but anecdotally  one hears that the  oncoming flow ofcheap Asian goods will result in significantly lower retail  prices  in the firsthalf of next year.  There is something for every  taste in this wage-price  stew.I  think we've taken  an honest sampling from the pot, rather than picking outthe bits that most appeal  to us; but you may disagree,  and we'll be happy  toanswer  any questions  you may wish to put to us regarding  our view.But, first, if I may,  let me turn the floor over to Karen.

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  As we stated in  the Greenbook, our forecast this  timefor the external  sector is not much changed  from that in  September.  Wehave chosen  not to  assume that the  depreciation  of the  dollar during theintermeeting  period will be  significantly  reversed.  As  a consequence,  ourpath for the  dollar going forward is  about 3 percent lower in the near term,and about  2 percent  lower toward the end of the  forecast  period, than lasttime.Such  a change in  our outlook for the dollar by itself would tend tostimulate exports and restrain  imports.  Offsetting this  stimulus  for exportsto  some extent is a somewhat  weaker projection  for real  output  growth  inour trading partners.By far the biggest downward  revision in  our outlook for  growth  abroadhas been  to our view  on Japan.  We  now  expect that the  trough in real outputwill not occur until  sometime  in 2000.  This more negative outcome  isexpected despite  injections  of fiscal  stimulus  of about  1-1/2  percent of GDPnext year.  We are  thus expecting  continuing  declines  in private  domesticdemand,  particularly business investment, with  little or no help  from theexternal  sector.  Since the Greenbook  was published,  we  have learned  someadditional  detail about  the latest fiscal package  proposed by the Japanese11/17/98government.  The package  contains  6 trillion  yen  of personal  and corporatetax cuts,  an  estimated 6  trillion yen of "real  water"  expenditures,  and  anadditional  array of measures  that are  expected  to provide  little  directeconomic  stimulus.  Accordingly, the  actual  stimulus contained  in  thepackage is probably not more than half the 24 trillion  headline  value and isbroadly  in line  with the Japanese  fiscal assumptions  in the NovemberGreenbook.  Given  the lags in implementing  these packages,  we expect  thatthe effects  of these measures  will be felt  during  the second  half of 1999,  asthe effects  from  the April  1998  package,  which  we  think are  now becomingvisible, begin  to wane.The  other country of particular  interest in  this forecast round is Brazil.In  putting together  the forecast, our strategy has  been to assume  that theinternational  rescue  package  for Brazil  succeeds  in the  sense that no  abruptchange  in the exchange  rate regime  is  forced upon  Brazil,  and no  contagionin that  respect  spills over to Argentina  or elsewhere.  Real GDP in Brazil  isexpected  to decline this  quarter  and through  1999,  but the trough is nowprojected  to occur in  early 2000,  and some recovery  begins  that year.  Thiscontraction  results from the high  interest rates  already  in place,  which  areprojected  to ease  some,  and the fiscal  restraint that is part of the policyprogram  Brazil has  announced.  We have built into the forecast  somecontraction  of output  elsewhere  in  South  America as  well.There  are  many pitfalls  in the  months  ahead that  could put the  Brazilianprogram  off track.  In the near term, Brazil  and its private  creditors  mustreach  an understanding  such that most, but not necessarily  all,  of theshort-term  external  credits to Brazil  are  maintained.  Domestic  creditors  alsomust refrain on net from moving capital  out  of Brazil.  The fiscal  agendamust proceed;  in particular,  the Brazilian  Congress  must enact crucialproposed  measures  so that an IMF review planned for February  1999  will besuccessful.  We  recognize  that it is far from certain  that all this will  proceedsmoothly.  In the Greenbook, it seemed  to  us more  useful  to present  in thebaseline the implications  for the foreign  sector under the  assumption  of"success,"  as at the moment that outcome  is  being actively  pursued byofficials  in Brazil  and  at the IMF.  We did include  as an  alternative  scenario,a model-based version  of the impact  of "meltdown"  in Brazil  and contagionelsewhere in  the region.  In that  event, with  no policy  adjustments  here, U.S.GDP growth  would be  reduced 1/2 to 3/4 percentage  point in  1999  and in2000.On  balance,  we look for the external  sector to subtract nearly  1percentage  point at an annual  rate from U.S.  GDP growth this  quarter  andabout half that in  1999 and 2000.  This  is a bit  less than we had beenthinking in  September, particularly for the current  quarter.11/17/98We would now be  happy to  take questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions for either?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  For Mike Prell, in Part 2 of the Greenbook, page III-19, there is asentence that says "Growth  of retail  money market  mutual funds and of currency  outstanding,both domestically  and overseas,  was strong over the most recent  two months."  Do we have  anyindication  of overseas  holdings of currency, whether  they have increased significantly,  andwhether we ought to be  taking that into account when we  look  at the  growth  rate of M2?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Dave Lindsey  follows that more  closely than I do.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  We were  actually prompted by a question  from Governor  Gramlich acouple of months ago to look intensively into this  question.  We have  considerably improved  ourestimation procedures,  including our seasonal  adjustment  procedures.  We have come up nowwith a series  that we find to be  the best estimate  we can produce.  What that  shows is thatwhereas  in recent  years  there  has been  an effect of a  little less than 1/2 percent  on the  growth ofM2 coming from  demand  abroad, that seems  to have  lessened  some most recently.  Let me giveyou some figures to  suggest what I'm talking about.  In September and October, our estimate  isthat foreign  holdings of U.S. currency  grew  at 13.8 percent  and 8.5  percent respectively.  Thatimplied,  however, growth  of domestically  held U.S.  currency in September and October  at evenfaster rates,  18-3/4 and 12-3/4 percent respectively.  When  we contrast  the growth  of M2 with  theinclusion  and the exclusion  of foreign  currency holdings,  it turns out not to make  too much  of adifference  in those recent months.  For example, M2 as we normally  calculate  it, including theforeign  currency  holdings,  grew  at a  14.8 percent  rate in September.  Without the foreigncurrency  holdings,  we have  estimated the growth  to be  14.9 percent.  In  October, the  twonumbers  are  12.3 percent  and 12.6  percent respectively.  So, on  balance in  recent months and11/17/98recent quarters,  it doesn't make  a material  difference whether  we look at our overall estimate  ofM2 or our estimate  of M2 stripping out the foreign currency  holdings.

[SECTION]

MR.  MCTEER.  That  seems kind of intuitive to me,  given what is going on overseas.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  You might remember  that the U.S.  economy  is  growing much morestrongly than many of these overseas  economies,  and that is  supporting profits  and growth ofM2.  One  might think that shipments to these countries  have risen  some but that they just havenot risen as  much as demand  for currency  in  the United States  has risen.  That is not thebenchmark that would determine them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  A question for Karen  Johnson:  When the Brazil agreement  wasannounced  recently, although  the way it was discussed was confusing,  there  seemed to be at leasta portion of it that was going to be handled  under what might be  characterized  as a newphilosophy that was incorporated  in either the G-7  agreement  or the Treasury's statements  on thesubject.  Is some  of the financing  going to be  distributed faster?

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  The standby encompasses  different  ways  of financing the  sum ofmoney involved.  A substantial  portion  of the initial  tranches  will be done under what is calledthe  SRF, which  is  actually a  facility that  was created  at the time of the Korean crisis.  Now thereis a variant  of that under discussion,  which  would have contingent  elements  to it.  It was referredto in the G-7  communique  and has been  discussed in the press  and elsewhere.  The contingentelement  was not really  in play for Brazil  because  events  overtook the debate, so to speak,  but thecharacteristics  of the SRF part are that it will be  at a penalty rate  and it will be  disbursed in largequantity initially in  an effort  to discourage  contagion  and speculation  and so forth.  But that isunder the  umbrella of the standby  arrangement.  The term  "standby"  can refer to financing this11/17/98way or financing  through  some  of the  other devices  at a  different pace.  In that  sense,  it is notabsolutely new.  But,  yes, this option  will be used for Brazil.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So, to  get to the heart  of the matter,  you mentioned the IMF reviewin February.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  They could  get money before that.

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  They will.  The first tranche will be  disbursed upon the  vote of theexecutive directors  of the  IMF,  and that money will  come immediately.  The conditions of thatfirst tranche  have  already  been  met.  They  were set and they had to do with  some of the items inthe fiscal  package  that were  already announced  and actions that the Brazilians  have  alreadytaken,  so that is  a given.  The next tranche will  come up for review  in  February of 1999.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Karen, I think it was  a little more than a  year ago that we  looked at aworse case  alternative  for East Asia.  One  of the two  countries that played  a role in  that wasBrazil,  and it is obvious from our discussion why that was the case.  The other one, of course,was  China.  It seems to me that there  are interesting  things  going on in China  about which itmight be  worthwhile to update  the Committee  either at our next meeting or even  as part of one  ofthe Monday  morning briefings.  China's growth  rate, at 8 percent at least by the  official  statistics,is  remarkably good.  Their external  position is quite  strong.  Yet at the same time, one  does seesome  financial  problems with  the ITICs  in  some of the  provinces.  Of course,  they areexperiencing  actual deflation,  which  might suggest that the renminbi  is overvalued.  I would findit  interesting, and perhaps  some of my  colleagues  would as well,  to know  what your latest11/17/98thoughts are  about either why they have been  so successful  in dealing with the problems  of EastAsia or whether  we,  in looking at the  official  statistics,  are  being deluded  by what might indeedbe the pressures  in China.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  I certainly take  your point.  The  8 percent number was somewhatunexpected.  We  have  not really  had the opportunity  to look into it, and it is hard to do so withChina because  we  don't get a  lot of detail and can not get behind the  scenes.  I  am  skeptical  but Ican't cite good reasons for that skepticism  other than that we know Asia as  an economic  area isin trouble,  and it is hard to believe that China is escaping  as it would  seem.  We will certainlyview  this as something  that we  should look into and get more  information  through  variouschannels  and give it to the Committee.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Of course, their approach  to the problems  is quite different  withexchange  controls  and so forth.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  Yes,  capital  controls and the like.  We  expect them to be able  tomaintain  the present exchange  regime into  1999, something  we had assumed previously withsome trepidation,  and it seems  to be  happening.  But I think we probably  do need to question thesequence of events  and the policy choices they are making  and ask some hard questions aboutthat.  We will try to do more about it.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Poole.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I want to go back  to the  monetary  aggregates.  My  friend from Texasreferred to  the currency  component of the  aggregates,  although  I thought Texans  alwaysconcentrated  on bigger  things than  currency.  Let's talk about savings  deposits for a minute,which  are three  times the  size of currency.  When  we look at the detail  on the aggregates,  the11/17/98really rapidly  growing  areas  are  savings  deposits  and money market  funds.  We know  that banksare filling some  of the gaps  in  the credit  market arising from  the partial  seizing up of thesecurities  markets.  Large  denomination  time deposits,  which banks often  use for funding  theircredit  growth,  are  shown  as  essentially  flat in the  table, but banks are  meeting  their fundingneeds  from money  market sources  as  well.  Banks  are  funding themselves  very comfortably  withvery  rapid growth of liquid deposits, probably mostly  from households.  Savings  deposits  aremostly from households  because  it does not make sense for businesses  to  hold such deposits.The money market mutual  funds also are  growing  very rapidly.  So, it looks to me that there isextremely rapid  growth in  the liquidity position  of households,  and it is not tapering  off with therecovery  of the equity markets.  I could understand  the story that households were  apparentlytaking  funds out of the equity markets  when those  markets were weak  and parking themtemporarily  in money  market funds, or somewhere.  But there is always the  question about thepeople on the other side  of the  equity markets because  for every dollar that comes  out of thestock market,  somebody  else  puts money into the market.  It is just the prices  that change.  Whatinsight can  you offer  as  to what to  make of this, Dave?  It has been  a phenomenon just sincethe  household  sector.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Yes, there is  no question  about it.  Everything  you have described isquite  accurate.  For example,  look at the chart  of M2 velocity  versus  its opportunity cost--inhonor of Bill Dewald  I will mention  a piece  he has published  using opportunity cost defined  asthe bond rate less the  own rate  on M2;  Board staff tend to look at the three-month  Treasury  billrate less the  own rate on M2.  With  either chart, you will  see an  upswing in  velocity thatoccurred  in the early  1990s extending  through  mid-1997.  Then  velocity  started coming back11/17/98down, and since mid-1997  it has fallen  every quarter.  Depending  on where  the opportunity  costline is placed and if the  velocity shift  is deemed  to have ended  around  1993, then  velocity isshown  as returning  to that  opportunity cost line.  One interpretation,  particularly if one chooses  ascale  that shows the cluster of points to be fairly narrow,  as Bill Dewald  did, is  that velocity ismore  or less returning to normal.  Another interpretation,  on which I personally tend to put moreweight, is that  we saw a continued  increase  in velocity after  1993  that was  somewhatinexplicable.  Now we have seen  a reversion to declines  in velocity,  which  also  are notcompletely  understandable.  Indeed, for this quarter, if we take  the Greenbook forecast  ofnominal GDP along with the money forecast, which we do our best with but as I indicated beforeis not always perfect, we get a velocity  decline of 8.7  percent.  In other  words,  much of theliquidity that you  have been describing  seems to be  showing up in  the ratio  of M2 to GDP ratherthan in GDP either currently  or in  a predicted  sense, at least if one believes  the Greenbookforecast.  We have  some explanations.  We can  always  come up with them  after the fact.  But thetruth is,  as I mentioned to someone  yesterday, I sat in that seat in February  of this year telling theCommittee that  it could expect M2 growth  of 31/2  percent this year, given the Greenbookforecast.  We now have  a  forecast of 9  percent  growth in M2, a  slight error in our Februaryprojection.  [Laughter]  The Greenbook  forecast admittedly  underestimated  the strength ofspending  this year and maybe there was  a signal  from the monetary aggregates  to that effect.  Butthere was  a lot more to it than that.  Velocity took up a great deal  of that error.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  President Poole, may I try to move from the  big picture  to the verysmall picture?  Looking at the  flows in the last few  weeks--and  recognizing  your point aboutsomebody is paying someone  and that makes  it a little difficult  to track this sensibly--it  does  lookto me in  the data that I have,  though I think we may have more recent  estimates, that savings11/17/98deposits  have  leveled out in the  last few  weeks  and money market fund growth  has deceleratedsubstantially.  This coincides quite precisely  with the time when  we see the reflow of money intothe equity  mutual funds,  not in quite the same  proportions  we saw in  the first part of this  year butstill substantial.  So, there does  seem to be  a correspondence  here that is consistent  with the  storythat people were  hesitating and parking money in these very short-term  assets.  And withTreasury  bill  yields  having come down  so sharply the  opportunity costs actually had narrowedfor putting the money  in savings  accounts.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  But we do have  to be  careful  about the magnitudes.  Money marketfunds have  decelerated in  October to  an  annual rate  of 31.5  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I am looking  at weekly  numbers  where  growth  has been inching  up bycomparison.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  Yes, I understand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Just a quick question  on Brazil.  I found this alternative  scenario  inthe Greenbook very helpful.  I took note of the U.S.  GDP projection  of minus 0.4  in  1999  and2000, but you were careful  to mention  that  this is by no means the  worst case concerning  apotential  meltdown  in Brazil.  I was wondering if you could give  us some idea of the relativeprobabilities  of this alternative  scenario  or even  a worse case.

[SECTION]

MS.  JOHNSON.  While  you're at  it, the timing as well! [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  All  derived from by the model,  of course.

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I think the next three weeks  are crucial  for at least the initial successof the Brazilian program.  The time between  now and the signing of the letter of intent, whichwill be on one of the  first days  in December,  is the first hurdle  that has to be gotten over.  People11/17/98even  less  cynical  than I might think that chances  are that  what is needed to get a  positive vote atthat first hurdle will  take place because  it is in the  interests of many parties to have  that happen.The critical  feature  is whether or not the private creditors  of Brazil,  both those  within the countryand external to the country,  appear  to be carrying  their fair share.  If so, the  governments thathave money  to be extended both through the IMF  and through bilateral  mechanisms  will feel  thatit is  appropriate to vote "yes"  and  the program  will go  forward.  So, one  might think that that willhappen,  although I  would not characterize  it as  100 percent  sure by any  stretch of theimagination.  But it certainly  is  still possible that  things will unravel  between  then  and Februaryof  1999, and  one way  it will become  obvious that things  are unraveling  is if Brazil  again  starts tolose reserves  rapidly.I would guess the likelihood that the baseline  Greenbook scenario  will occur  is in theneighborhood  of 50  percent,  maybe  a little more.  We thought it had a  good chance or we wouldnot have given  it any credence.  The meltdown  scenario is  a  fairly contained  one; it has spilloversfor Argentina, it has some  implications  for Mexico,  and it would be messy.  Exactly how thiswould take place  is not clear.  It might  include a combination  of some  unilateral  actions  on thepart  of Brazil,  some forced  exchange  rate adjustment,  and then a return  to the IMF  and anattempt to restart negotiations--all  of which would certainly play  out over some period of time.  Iguess I would give this scenario  a big chunk of the remaining  probability.  So,  if the probabilityof the Greenbook scenario  is 55  or 60 percent,  this alternative  may be another 25 to 30 percent.But there  is at least a  5 to  10 percent probability that Brazil  could  fall so hard thatHong  Kong, for example, would become threatened  again,  a possibility  that is  not in thisscenario.  Hong Kong  is the other fixed exchange  rate  regime that has been tested repeatedlysince this crisis began.  If Hong Kong is forced off of its peg, then the progress  that we have seen11/17/98to  date in  Korea and Thailand might be called  into question because  capital  markets  would againbecome  skeptical  of their  viability, and the  citizens  of those countries  would begin to  feel thatthey  should move their capital  elsewhere.  That could trigger  a worse  scenario that I would notgive a lot  of weight to, but  one whose probability  is not zero  by any means.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Who would like to start off the Committee'sdiscussion?  President Poole.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I didn't realize I was  going to be that close to  the top of the list![Laughter]  Let me talk a bit about  the Eighth District first.  I think our  situation is largely  amicrocosm  of the national  picture.  I would like to comment particularly on  a new  source  ofinformation  that I am in the  process  of developing.confidentiality.I have this information  under a pledge  of our11/17/98With regard to national economic conditions,  I would note that although the forecastfor the fourth  quarter in  this Greenbook is down  from that in  the last Greenbook,  the third quartercame in higher  than was  expected  and therefore  the second  half of 1998  now  looks somewhatstronger  than at the last meeting.  It's just by  a few tenths, but generally the picture  is for a littlemore  strength than we had been expecting.  My  sense  is that output has  overshot fullemployment  and that the labor market has  been pushed temporarily  beyond  its long-runsustainable  capacity.  If that view  is correct, we  are  going to  see  growth  in the near term belowthe  long-term trend for a  while as the economy returns to its sustainable path.  That is my  sensefrom  all the information  that we have about  the  labor market  and the pressures  that  we've seen,particularly  all the unfilled jobs and the difficulty in finding people to fill  certain job positions.11/17/98So, the question for me  is whether this  below-trend growth,  let's say over the  next year or so, isgoing  to occur  with or without rising  inflation.I think the financial  turmoil around the  globe has passed its  peak.  My reading of Asiais  that we're seeing some  progress,  with the  very important  exception  of Japan.  Prices  in manyof the Asian equity markets  are  a little higher, exchange rates  are  a little stronger, the bondspreads  are a little narrower,  and conditions generally  seem  to be getting  a  little better there.I don't know  where the appropriate  place is to bring  up this matter today,  but includedin my FOMC packet  that was delivered  to  the hotel  last night was  a letter from the NationalAssociation  of Manufacturers  (NAM) urging this  Committee, urging me in particular,  to lowerinterest rates.  I hope that in the future the staff will  not include  such letters that come fromoutside sources in  my FOMC  packet.  If word  gets around  about this, my briefcase  will not bebig enough to carry home all the mail  I might receive.  I am happy  to respond to the NAM  folksif they write to me in  St. Louis,  but I don't think it is appropriate  for their letters to  come here.Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, overall  activity  slowed in our District in the thirdquarter as  it did elsewhere,  but my sense is that it has strengthened on balance over the periodsince our last meeting.  Consumer  spending in  October in  particular was considerably  strongerthan anticipated.  Automobile  sales  and outlays  for other durable  goods  were especially robust inconsiderably more optimistic  in our region  than they  were a few  weeks  ago.  Housing  activity,both sales  and construction, also  appears to remain  quite  solid throughout our District on thebasis of anecdotal  information  we are  getting from our directors  and others.  One director we11/17/98have  from the District of Columbia described conditions  in the housing market here  as booming.The main  weak spot  in our region,  as  elsewhere  I guess, is  manufacturing  due to thedisproportionate  impact  of negative international  developments  on that sector.  Farming also  isdown,  owing to weak prices  and  income.  One of our directors  from South  Carolina  said they didnot have any  agriculture  in  South Carolina this  year.On  the financial  side in  our District, bank business  lending  has increased  very sharplyrecently, especially  at the larger banks  as companies  that  have been  shut out  of the securitiesthe lowest-rated  borrowers  in  our region,  albeit  at higher rates  than earlier in the year.  To roundout information  on the District, I would just add that  yesterday  I attended the  meeting of theCommittee  on Revenue  Estimates for the Virginia  Governor,  with 20 Virginia  CEOs in themeeting.  I was struck by the number  who still  emphasize  the tightness of labor markets  and thedifficulty they are having  finding qualified people  at all levels of the  experience  and knowledgespectrum.With respect to the national  economy,  the Greenbook is projecting  a deceleration  ofreal growth to  a below-trend rate  next year, even  with an assumed further easing  of monetarypolicy.  There is no question in my mind that this is  a plausible forecast,  but it depends heavilyon a halving of growth in  consumer spending  next year.  That could happen,  but it seems to mefar from a sure thing.  Certainly there is not much  evidence  of any  marked deceleration  ofhousehold spending  currently.  Problems  in  capital  markets  do not appear to be constrainingconsumer credit  to  any significant  degree.  Some  have  argued that the low recent  saving ratecould crimp consumer  outlays going  forward.  But some  empirical  work  and research  we havedone at our Bank shows that on average  over the last 20 or 25 years  low  saving rates have11/17/98preceded increased  rather than diminished growth  of consumer  spending.  A weaker  stockforecasting  either the stock market  or its impact on consumers.  There  also  is Bill Poole'scomment  and observation  during the question period about the  strong  growth in  householdliquidity.In  short, it seems to me  that consumer  spending  could decelerate  less than is projectedin the Greenbook.  If it did, overall  GDP growth would  be close  to potential,  which  would be afavorable  development  in my view.  I think that scenario  is not much, if any, less plausible thanthe Greenbook projection.  Obviously, the  still  unsettled conditions in  capital markets  posecontinuing downside  risk to the economy, but the  aversion  to risk in capital markets has  clearlydiminished greatly  in recent days.  A number of yield spreads have  narrowed significantly.  Riskpremia,  of course,  are  still higher than they were  before August,  but the  overall  creditintermediation  process seems to be adjusting  to this.  Credit flows that would have bypassed thebanks in the more normal  circumstances  that prevailed  before August are now going through thebanking system.  Bank credit rose at a 27 percent  annual rate in  October on a reported basis,  andthe  accelerated  growth of M2  indicates,  as  you would expect, that the size of our open marketoperations has  increased as  the demands  for liquidity are being met.In  sum, the  economy may not be out of the  woods  yet, but prospects  seem distinctlybetter now than  they were  at the time of the  September meeting.  I think that may justify a littlecaution on our part when  we  address policy later.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting and particularlysince our mid-October  actions,  a degree  of calmness  seems to have  replaced  at least some of the11/17/98unsettled conditions  of late  September.  However,  our contacts  remain more  nervous  anduncertain  about the future than  they were in mid-summer.  In many  respects, conditions  in  theSeventh District  are quite  similar to what  I reported  in late September.  Growth  in  ourmanufacturing  sector has  slowed further,  although  activity  levels generally remain  high.Housing activity remains  strong,  and consumer  spending  continues  to be relatively  healthy.Price pressures  remain  benign despite tight labor markets.  The latest Manpower  survey of hiringplans  for the first quarter of 1999  suggests little change  from the  strong plans reported for thecurrent quarter  as  well as from  a year ago.  These  results  will not be  made public until nextMonday,  November 23, so they  should be considered  confidential  until then.  The key point fromthe survey is that aside from normal seasonal  movements, there  is no  indication  that the laborWe continue  to see signs  of slowing  in our manufacturing  sector,  but conditions  thereare mixed.  Foreign markets are  adversely  impacting  producers  of electronics,  steel,  andagricultural  equipment.  In the steel  industry, the production  decline  from a  year ago is nowgreater in our District than for the nation  as a whole.  Domestic  producers continue  to bechallenged  by steel imports,  which  doubled their U.S.  market share from about 20 percent  to 40percent this past  summer.  The  head of one steel  company told me that he  believes that worldsteel prices  are bottoming and that firms  are  more  likely to  shut down  capacity now  than toreduce  prices  any further.  In contrast,  domestic  demand continues  to  support fairly  strongactivity  at our heavy  and light motor vehicle producers  as well as housing-related  manufacturers.One contact in the heavy  truck industry  described  business as  booming, but he  immediately  saidhis firm was making extensive contingency  plans for next year that would be implemented11/17/98quickly if necessary.  Industry  sources  suggest that  auto and light truck sales  this month  will bestrong, though  not as  robust as  the annual rate of 16-1/2  million  units in October.Because  of the recent financial  market  volatility, we made a  special  effort to contactsome market participants  at the Chicago  futures  and options exchanges.  Although our contactsbelieve  they have  successfully  weathered the extraordinary  volatility of late  summer and earlyfall, many were apprehensive  about the  market's  ability to withstand  future  shocks.  One concernis that market depth may suffer in the months  ahead.  Banks face  pressure to get  exposure  offtheir books  and consequently  they have cancelled lines of credit to some clearing  members.Further, year-end  redemptions by hedge  fund customers  may stress the markets.  The second keyissue is that some over-the-counter  swap market  participants  are  apparently  concerned  about thecondition  of some of their large  money center bank counterparties.  As a result, these  participantsare increasingly  substituting  away from over-the-counter  contracts  into relatively more  expensivefutures contracts.  These  contracts  reduce  the participants'  credit risk by substituting  theAAA-rated exchanges  as counterparties  in  place of many of the money center banks.Conditions in the  agricultural  sector remain weak.  Our latest  survey of agriculturalbanks showed third-quarter  farmland values  down  on average  for our five District states.Bankers  also reported  an increase  in loan  extension requests  and expect  that loan repaymentdifficulties will emerge.  The inflation picture  generally remains  quite  good.  The auto  industry,for example, is negotiating  a  3 percent reduction  in steel prices in next year's  supply contracts.However, two different  retailers noted  to me that construction costs  for new stores  had risenconsiderably  in the  last year.Turning to the  national economy, although  somewhat more balanced than at our lastmeeting, I still believe that the risks remain  greater on the downside.  Three factors  seem11/17/98especially important  at this time.  First, although  stock market prices  have rebounded  sharply  inrecent weeks,  market volatility remains  high and that should restrain  consumption  spendingsomewhat in  the months ahead.  Second,  although credit  spreads have  narrowed  since ourintermeeting  rate  cut, financial  markets  remain jittery and spreads  could easily climb  again.Finally, the risks of rising inflation  appear to be relatively low.  Although  labor markets continueto be tight and wage  growth is rising, productivity  growth has  been strong  enough  to largelyoffset those gains.  Moreover, declining  profit margins  going forward  are likely to  stiffen  theresolve  of many firms  to hold the  line on wage  increases.  These factors  combined with thecontinued  dismal international  outlook--we  were  talking  about  Japan  and Brazil  earlier--lead  meto the  view that  the risks  remain greater  on the downside.

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  the Twelfth  District economy  has expanded  at a  solidpace  in recent months,  although the disparity  across  states has increased  and the pace  of growthhas  moderated  from earlier  this year.  Employment  growth in our fastest growing states, Arizona,Nevada,  and Washington,  is  averaging  between  3  and 5 percent on a  12-month  basis.  It isinteresting  that the State  of Washington  is  also the state  that probably is  among the mostvulnerable  to  developments  in East  Asia in  terms of trade.  Five other District states,  Alaska,Idaho, Hawaii,  Oregon,  and Utah,  are expanding  at or below  the national pace of growth.  InCalifornia, employment  growth remains  solid at 2.8  percent, although  it is  significantly slowerthan  the 3.8  percent pace  of expansion in  1997.Construction  and services  as  well  as  finance,  insurance,  and real  estate have continuedto be the strongest sectors  of the District economy.  Slower overall  growth has  yet to loosen11/17/98District labor markets  significantly.  District unemployment  in September  was just 0.1percentage  point above  the average  for  1997.Returning  to California,  the East Asian  economic  slowdown has reduced employmentgrowth throughout the state,  but its  impact has varied  significantly  across regions.  Strong tradeties to East Asia, especially in the  high-tech manufacturing  area,  have pushed employmentgrowth in  the San Francisco Bay  area below that for the state as a whole for the  first time in threeyears.  In  contrast, the more  diversified  southern  California economy  has remained relativelyimmune  to global  economic  turmoil,  with  little deceleration  in growth  from last year.  Thechanging pattern  of growth in California  is helping to equalize  the levels of economic  activity inthe Bay  Area and Southern  California  following  the  deep recession  and slow recovery in the LosAngeles/Long  Beach Area.Turning to the nation, we believe the outlook for economic  activity has improvedsince the Committee  met in  September largely because  of the easing  of monetary  policy, thean unchanged federal  funds rate and no further changes  in the  stock market or the  dollar, we haveraised  our forecast of real  GDP for 1999  by about 1/2 percent to 2  percent.  I  see risks on bothsides  of this forecast.  On  the upside,  growth in  the economy  has outperformed  most forecasts forthe past three years,  and this certainly could continue.  On the  downside,  the  stock market  is stillovervalued  according  to most models,  and although  U.S. debt markets  have  stabilized  somewhatin recent  weeks,  risk spreads  are still elevated, and  confidence remains vulnerable.  Thereobviously are still many  risks in the international  arena  as  well.Under our forecast, there  is continuing  upward pressure  from tight labor markets  onwage  and price inflation  next year, although  the  magnitude of this effect  diminishes  over time  as11/17/98the unemployment  rate  rises.  However,  price  inflation  continues to benefit  from low inflationexpectations,  ample industrial  capacity, falling commodity prices,  higher trend growth  inproductivity, and negative  speed effects as the economy  slows.  As  a  consequence,  we  expectinflation  in the core  CPI to average  2-1/4 percent both this year and next, and that is using aconsistent definition  for the CPI.  Overall,  if we  assume an unchanged monetary policy, ourprojections  show  a  constructive  outlook for the economy  with moderate  real  GDP growth  andmoderate inflation  as well.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

MR. MCTEER.  The Eleventh  District economy  is showing  increasing signs of slowergrowth  especially  in the  goods-producing  sectors  including energy, petrochemicals,semiconductors,  and  now commercial  construction  as  well; the latter had been  quite robust untilrecently.  Commercial  construction  is being held back by financing  considerations,  higher creditstandards, reduced REIT  activity,  and so forth, but there is some  feeling that that is not altogetherbad.  It may be a timely constraint on a new  round of overbuilding.  Employment growth in  thegoods-producing  sectors has decelerated from vigorous  in  the first quarter  to barely  positive inthe third.  Employment  has declined in oil  and gas  extraction  and in oil service industries.  OurTexas  index of leading indicators  has  declined for the past five months.  The declines have  beenbroad-based,  with seven  of the eight components  declining.  Our forecasting  model of Texasemployment  growth,  which has been very accurate  over the past three  years, forecastsemployment  growth  of 0.3 percent in  1999.  Our leading index  for the Mexican  economy  alsosignals  more slowing there  in 1999  than we have  seen  thus far, with negative  implications for theEleventh District.  This  is consistent with  a reduction  of spending by Mexican  nationals in Texasborder cities, which  we have noticed,  and with a reduction  of U.S. currency  flowing into our San11/17/98Antonio branch from  border areas  and from Mexico  itself; this  probably reflects Mexican  fearsof further  peso depreciation  more than  an actual  decline in  activity so far.On the national  front,  I have  no unique  insights to offer.  Risk and  liquidity premiumshave  declined  since October  15 but remain high.  Financial  markets  around the world continue  tobe  vulnerable.  There have been  arguments  on both sides  of the  policy question.  I guess where Icome  out is that the fire department  has  only a  limited amount of water to  deliver to  a fire.  It isbetter to get  there earlier  rather than  later.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The New England economy continuesto perform  quite  well, but growth  is slowing  and uncertainty  seems to occupy  a larger proportionof anecdotal  conversations.  Nonetheless,  at least for some areas  of New England,  notablyGreater Boston,  some slowing could be welcome if it increases  commercial  vacancy  rates, if itstabilizes  or slows the growth  in home prices  and  apartment rents, if it puts a  brake on medicalcost  increases,  and if it adds  a little more breathing room to the  labor markets.It is not quite a tale of two cities.  But with international  and financial uncertaintyhitting some firms and others hampered  only by their inability to  get workers,  one can get a verydifferent picture  of New  England depending on  where the data originate and whom one talks to.New  England  labor markets remain  quite tight, with employment  growth  slower than the  nation'sbut a bit faster than historical  levels, and unemployment  rates  well below the national  average.Employment  growth varies considerably  by industry.  Construction, tourism,  finance, insurance,and real estate  employment  are growing  at solid rates,  while manufacturing  employment  has11/17/98announced  layoffs  as have a number  of smaller firms.  These layoffs  appear to be very closelyrelated to the spreading  ripples  of the Asian situation.Retail contacts,  as well as  those in a wide range  of high-tech  businesses,  reportdifficulties  in  attracting  and retaining workers  even for seasonal jobs,  and firms  have reportedslowing  growth due  to a  lack of new  employees.  This at least partially  reflects  a  reversal  in thegrowth  of the region's  labor force due  to a decline  in the participation  rate  and a decrease  in netin-migration  from other states.  There  is, however,  no translation  that we can  see  from thearguably  tighter-than-average  labor market in New England  to generally  higher wages than  thosepaid in  the nation as  a whole, except  in certain  industries.The Boston CPI rose by 2.6 percent,  a little higher than the national rate, but thisdifference seems  almost totally the result of medical  care cost increases,  which  climbed almost  9percent over the past  year.As of the second quarter,  the region's  merchandise  exports  were  3  percent below  ayear earlier,  but almost all of this decline was concentrated  in Asian  markets.  Consumer andbusiness confidence,  while  still positive, reflects the possibility  of reduced  growth in spendingand economic  activity.  Most  of this involves readings  of future  expectations,  however,  with bothconsumers and businesses positive about the current picture  but uncertain  about  the future.Financial  market  volatility  clearly has played a role in heightening the  levels  of uncertainty.Some  continue to see  this period as simply  a swing back  from the very low  spreads of thesummer, while others  are concerned  that liquidity is not back to normal levels  and that fundingconstraints  could hamper future economic  growth.  But here  again the story varies  quite a lotdepending  on whom you  speak to.11/17/98Money  managers  are worried, to  say the least, but small businesses  continue to reporta  great deal  of competition  among banks  for their  business.  Some bankers  believe that thesupervisory message  of concern  about REIT  and other real estate  lending  is really  affecting theirbusiness,  as  no New  England banker who survived  the regulatory  travails of the  early  1990swants to  go  down that road again.  On the other hand, a major real  estate developer  told merecently  "the  markets have  saved us from ourselves."  Clearly, speculative  real  estate dealsthroughout  the region  are now  on hold, a  welcome sign given the  speculative  excess thatpreceded  the early  1990s recession.Commercial  and industrial  lending shows  little in the way of slowing,  however.  Basedon data from  the three large banks  in the region, C&I loan growth has  reached nearly double  thepace  of the nation's in recent weeks,  with some tightening  of standards  at  one institution  butnone  at the  other two.  Clearly,  First District banks  have helped to pick up the slack from thetightening of bond markets, particularly  as  it affected non-investment-grade  borrowers.  In sum,while conditions  by industry  are mixed and the various states and cities in the region  have theirown particular stories,  the New  England economy continues to grow  and thrive--perhaps  at aslower pace--not  unlike the national picture.Turning to the  nation, we agree  with the Greenbook  that the  economy seems poised tomake a transition  to a lower  growth path.  Job growth  is  slowing; consumer  sentiment is  off a bitbut still at a rather high level; the personal  saving rate may not remain  negative;  and businessfixed investment  should  slow given  the rise  in wages  and lower, if not negative,  profit margins.We agree  that an inventory  correction  probably  looms ahead, but the  size of the  correctionprojected  in  the Greenbook  and its  suddenness  seem  to us a little  large.  We  also believe equity11/17/98prices  may flatten or fall,  given the profit picture,  and that this will  feed back  to consumerspending  as  families  feel less wealthy.However,  when we  take all  these factors  together, our  forecast puts us  about atpotential  for the fourth  quarter  and for  1999,  albeit  with  a lower unemployment  rate than  theGreenbook and  some uptick in core  CPI even  without the additional  25  basis point ease  that isincorporated  in the Greenbook forecast.  We  do  not think this  is a particularly  bad outcome.  Wethink it is  not inconsistent  with the rebound in  equity prices, the reduction  in risk spreads,  and thecurrent  strength  in motor  vehicle  sales,  durable  goods  orders, and retail  sales.  In fact, there  issome risk that growth  in the near term could be  stronger, particularly if the  stock marketincreases  hold, consumer  spending remains  healthy,  inventory accumulation  in the third quarterturns out to be  more  intended than unintended,  and  financial panic  dissipates  as it now  seems tobe doing.  In  that event,  we might  see  a good deal  stronger picture  in  1999 than  we project.We  do admit that there  are  downside  risks.  Equity prices  could fall  further than eitherwe or the  Greenbook project.  Various  aspects  of the external  environment  could turn moresharply  negative,  particularly in Brazil  and Japan.  The financial  panic could resume.Consumers  and businesses  could retrench to a  greater degree  than now seems  likely.  Moreover,it also seems  that financial  markets remain fragile,  at least for the near term.  There  is somewidespread  expectation  that we  will  ease  either now or at our next meeting  to address thatfragility.  However,  I  believe we do not want to  go  all the way back  to the  conditions in  the creditprevious  degree  of fragility.11/17/98I think we face  a delicate balance  given the  rebound on the  equity side  and given thestrength  in consumer spending, at least in the  short run.  So,  in that regard I believe thatvigilance, which has served us well for most of this year,  may continue  to be the  answer  now.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Signs  of moderation  or at  least a levelingoff in  the rate of growth have begun  to emerge in  our District also.  While some of that can betraced  to international  developments,  perhaps  more reflects a pause  or a respite in  a maturingexpansion.  People  clearly are  being more  cautious  in their  spending and lending.  I am hearingeconomic  activity described  as  good, or very  good, or pretty strong as compared with theextraordinary adjectives  that we  were hearing  a few months  ago.Reflecting  the moderation  that I referred to, retail  sales increases  in our region  havebeen more modest recently  and inventories  have  risen slightly.  Our most recent  manufacturingsurvey  and industry contacts  indicate that factory production,  new orders, and employment  haveincreased only modestly.  At the  same time, strength in our tourism and hospitality industrycontinues  to help stabilize  the regional  economy;  and despite the short-term adverse  impacts  ofHurricane  Georges,  bookings  are strong  and theme  parks are expected  to be  packed over theChristmas  holidays.To be sure,  there are pockets  of special  difficulties  in  our region.  For example,regional  steelmakers  have recently  announced  layoffs and  are  seeing inventories  build.  Someoneremarked  recently that steel  has gone from just-in-time  inventory management  to just-put-it-over-there.  [Laughter]  We are  also seeing  some definite  indications that housing may havepeaked in  our area,  and there is evidence  that the  very strong commercial  real estate sector  hasbegun  to soften.  In  South Florida, there are concerns  that weakness  in  South America  and Asia11/17/98way yet.  Hardest hit in our region  have been the pulp and paper,  forest products,  and energysectors.  Lower oil  and gas prices  have discouraged  drilling, and the rig count  is now the lowestthat it has  been in  three  years.  Finally, despite continuing tight labor markets,  employers  stillseem to be resisting wage increases,  and we continue to get  fragmentary  reports  that laborshortages  have delayed  the expansion  plans of some firms.We made  a special  effort  to determine  what, if anything,  we could detect aboutprospective corporate investment  spending plans and found that the evidence  is  mixed.  Somefirms are  cutting back,  some are being more  cautious, and some  are  simply continuing  to expand.Our manufacturing  survey outlook  index for capital  expenditures declined  nearly 3  percentagepoints, yet we found numerous  examples  of firms continuing  their investment plans.  In  general,we  learned that cutbacks  are being planned exactly  where  one would expect,  in the  traded goodsarea that is being adversely  affected  by international  problems,  while  expansion  is continuing inservice  industries  and domestically  oriented production.We also, like  others,  made some attempts to  assess whether  there has been significantchange  in  the  availability  and terms  of credit.  Reports that we  get from  talking to lendersindicate  that the credit adjustments  seem to have been  dictated by prudence  rather  than  a pullingout of lending markets.  The  one  area where funding seems  to have dried up has been  in REITlending  for development  in the Southeast.  Overall,  I would not characterize  these  financialLatin America  continue to come home  with reports  of severe contractions  in lending,  includingtrade loans, in that part of the world.11/17/98On  the  national  front, I'm a bit more  optimistic  about the  pace of growth in  the periodahead than  is the Greenbook.  Certainly,  recent  data suggest  that the  U.S.  economy hasconsiderable  resiliency  and remains  relatively strong, perhaps  stronger than many of usanticipated.  Looking beyond the near term,  I agree  that a slowdown,  but a gradual  one, seems tobe  in the offing.  While employment  has softened  a little, early pessimism for holiday salesseems to be abating.  While we certainly  see some  slowing in investment spending,  especially inthe goods-producing  sector, it is my sense that spending  on productivity-enhancing  equipmentwill continue to be strong  and that those businesses in the  service area and those producingprimarily for domestic  markets  will continue  to invest.In hindsight, our intermeeting policy move was timely,  and financial  markets, aseveryone  else has observed,  appear to have  calmed considerably.  The adjustments that havetaken place in  lending standards  and terms are probably  a good thing.  Echoing PresidentMinehan's comment,  the  rationing of credit for real estate  development in markets  that hadbecome  a bit frothy should help damp the boom/bust cycles  that we have  seen so many times inthat industry.  In the  spirit of letting markets  adjust, we  should also be comfortable  to  let equityClearly,  we remain  vulnerable to  further international  shocks.  The more I learn  aboutJapan, the  more I realize  that  a big turnaround there  is not likely to come very  soon.  As the partof the country  that is most closely attached to Latin America,  I clearly  understand how unsettledthings are  there.  We  have enjoyed  a number of weeks  now without a big,  bad development  orrevelation,  and it is difficult  to judge just how  fragile our economic  psyche  is at the moment.11/17/98All  that  said, with  acknowledgement  of the downside  risks,  it  seems  to  me that we arein  a period  where we can  afford  to be a bit  cautious  and patient  and  let things play out.  Thankyou, Mr. Chairman.

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  As  is usually the  case,  conditions in ourDistrict  are partly like those in the Eighth District  but especially like  those in the  Seventh  Districtwith regard  to motor vehicles  and  so  on.  One  big difference  that I  had failed to note,  until adirector  pointed it out to me a couple  of Saturdays  ago,  was  the sudden,  dramatic plunge  inconsumer  confidence  when  Ohio  State lost to Michigan.  [Laughter]  I  assume that there  was anoffset in East Lansing.One director  at a recent  meeting  argued that  we  are suffering  from  a severe  shortage  ofpeople.  Our problem in the region  is  that we  cannot  fill  up the  hotels,  the motels, the  shoppingmalls--although  they  are pretty packed--the  houses,  and the office  buildings that are  being builtbecause there just are not enough  people.  One  major homebuilder  in southwest Ohio  andnorthern  Kentucky  said that  1999 will  be the best year  ever.  Builders  tell  us thattaxpayer-financed  construction  in  1999  will exceed that of  1988  if they can find the  workersneeded  to  build all of it.  So, we need a  strategy  for the region to get more people  to do the workand  to fill up all these places.  About  the only things that we seem  to be able  to build and fillreadily  are the prisons.  I am tempted to suggest  that we  go down  to Texas  to try to recruit  somepeople  there,  but I am skeptical  about how  effective  that effort  would  be.  That's because thehead  of the construction  trades union  on our board told us that the scarcity  of labor is so severethat construction  workers  are complaining that they're not getting their usual time  off for deerhunting.  So, I'm not sure  we can recruit the workers  that  we need.11/17/98In conversations  with directors  and advisory  councils  since the  last meeting,references  to the  notion of a credit  crunch or credit crisis came up frequently.  A commoncomment was that they were  mystified in that what they understood  was going on in  globalcapital markets  simply didn't apply to their customers.  Some bankers  said that they had  lookedhard for financial  strains.  They  figured that would give them an  opportunity to deploy some oftheir excess liquidity  more profitably  than in the past, but they were  not able  to find suchopportunities.  Business  loans are  still being  made at fixed rates  of 7  and 7-1/2  percent for up to 15years  and no personal  guarantees.  One  banker reported  a  deal with  a  10-year maturity at a fixedrate  of less  than  7 percent.  There  are complaints that the  competition  is still  bidding down thepricing  on loans to medium  and small  businesses.  It is not an issue for them of having survived acredit crunch;  it simply  did not happen.There  is a disparity in the outlook  in that the communities  and the businesses tied tosteel in particular  are in  a very gloomy mood  and say that  1999 is not going to be that great  ayear.  If anything,  we  are  going to see more plant closings  and more layoffs in businesses  relatedto metals.  Agriculture  is  also suffering  some strains.  There  are record crop volumes, but that hasnot fully offset the  depressed  prices.In retail, there  is a nervous  optimism.  The malls  are packed now,  but retailers  areworried  that it will not last.  Bankers  and  others are trying to draw  a connection  between thestock market  and  consumer  optimism,  but they seem to want  to have the  causality going bothways.  I really don't know  what to make  of that.  One banker, an  active member of ourcommunity  bank advisory  council,  said that  an indication  of consumer optimism is that 80percent  or more of the  ballot initiatives in the  region  passed.  He  said he  thinks that when thevoters approve  anything for bond financing or tax increases, they must be  feeling good.  One11/17/98banker believes  an  indication  of trouble is that  a chain  of 16 pawnbrokers  is  reporting recordtraffic.  Maybe people  are just hocking  things so  they  can  buy more Asian  goods;  I don't know.Labor turnover continues  to be a problem  in the  retail  industry.  Frequently  mentioned are  risingstarting wages,  overall  compensation,  and of course  the  poor quality  of the people  who apply forjobs.Some bankers  in  the area have reported that a  withdrawal  of the Japanese  lenders  hasallowed them to increase  margins  and gain back  some lost customers.  One regional  bank wastelling us that  loan  demand  bounced back dramatically  and was  surprisingly  strong  in the thirdquarter  and will  probably  be even  stronger in the fourth quarter.  We had a  meeting  with thesenior credit  officers of eight of the largest  banking  companies in the area and asked them abouttheir policies.  They  said that,  having received  letters from  the  Board and  the OCC  abouttightening credit  standards,  they felt more reluctant in the course  of putting  the largest amount  ofloans  on their books  in  a very  long time.  At least they  had their attitudes  right,  because they  allsmiled  about it!  One banker  contends that the jolt, as he puts it, to the capital markets  was verymuch needed  and has brought back realistic  pricing for risk in his  view.Auto production,  as Mike  Moskow reported,  is very  strong.  All the auto  communitiesare very buoyant.  Heavy truck production  is not  only operating at  high levels,  but the orderbacklog  going into  1999 is reported to be at historically  high levels.  In contrast, makers  ofconstruction  and agricultural  equipment  are  telling us that  orders recently  have been  falling  offsharply  and production  will  be lower next year.On the national  economy, I want  to say  a few  words  about money  and monetary policyand the conjecture  that what  we have  seen in terms of some of the monetary  aggregates--notablymutual  fund balances,  money  market  balances,  and various  types  of savings  balances--is  related11/17/98to  the  stock market.  Saying that the  behavior of money just reflects  a decline in  velocity is, ofcourse,  tautological;  it doesn't help us to  understand the  causality.  Any statement about  velocityis a statement  about the  demand for money.  If it had anything to do with increased  uncertaintyrelated  to the  capital  markets  and the  stock market,  then  we  would expect the rise  in velocity tobe  reversed  at some point in the  context of a decline  in the broad  money measures.  Earlier in  thelevel with  that because  other  measures were growing  very rapidly.  Usually  when  we have  theseexplanations  about depositors,  whether it is households  or others that are shifting their behavior,there  are  disparate  movements  of the various narrower  and broader measures  of money andcredit.  This time we  are not seeing that.  What we are  seeing is that the monetary base adjustedfor sweep  accounts, MZM, M2, M3,  total  bank credit--all  of these measures--havesimultaneously  been increasing  very  dramatically.  I think this is an  issue in search  of anexplanation that can  let us feel  comfortable  with what we can see going  on and that will leave  usunconcerned  about the implications down the road.  But I'm concerned  about  the implicationsdown the road.  I think there's at least a risk that we're going to  see that monetary growthshowing  up in  ways, whether  it's in the  asset markets  or in  the goods markets,  that we  are notgoing to  be happy about.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  far as the Ninth  District economy  isconcerned, there has  been  no appreciable  change  in recent months.  Labor markets  remain  verytight.  If anything, they have  tightened further because we  are getting  the normal  increase  inseasonal  part-time  demand for  workers.  Consumer  spending  has been  strong  and that appears  tobe continuing.  My unscientific  survey of mall parking lots  suggests that they are operating close11/17/98to  capacity, or  in some  cases  even  beyond.  Construction  remains  strong.  Banks are seeingstrong loan demand  in part, no  doubt, because  other investors  and lenders  have disengaged  tosome extent.  My impression is that bankers  are both  willing and able  to accommodate  thedemand that they  are seeing.Less favorably,  conditions  in both manufacturing  and mining are  mixed, depending  ontheir exposure  internationally,  and agriculture has  problems of one degree or another throughoutmuch  of the District largely  as  a  consequence of both crises.  If you're  looking for  change in ourDistrict, you have to look to the governor's  office  in Minnesota!  [Laughter]As  far as the national economy  is concerned,  I would use the phrase  "broadlyacceptable"  to describe  what is going on.  I am referring  to recent developments  and conditionsin the economy  and the  outlook, as I see  it, for both economic  growth and inflation.  I certainlywould say that recent  trends  in financial  markets  are  broadly acceptable,  and better than  I mighthave guessed  a month  ago, or certainly six  or seven  weeks  ago.  No doubt part of this is  due tothe policy changes  we made, and there  is now a danger of overreacting to the  last six or sevenweeks  of readings on  these various  things.  But taking  a step back, all  this reminds  me ofsomething  that I think we  have  known for a while,  and that is that our economy is  fundamentallyvery resilient.  I believe that  is what we are  seeing.

MS. RIVLIN.  I think the evidence is  accumulating  that the  real U.S.  economy is runby  a bunch of cheerful  little  elves  [laughter]  who do not like forecasters.  Every so often they gettogether and  say,  "Okay,  guys, if we work real  hard, maybe we  can surprise  them  again."  Butdon't knock the elves;  they've been doing quite  a  good job for most of the  1990s and we have  allbenefited.  The U.S. domestic  economy  has  certainly  shown heartening  resilience in the  face of11/17/98global  downdrafts  in the  last year  and particularly  in  the last three months,  much as  it  showedresilience  and adaptability to upward pressures  and  threats of overheating  in the  previous  coupleof years.  Consumers  are  spending  cheerfully, buying  houses and cars  and maintaining a  fairlyrobust  outlook on their situation.  In their  role as small  investors,  some of the same  people arereinforcing  their own optimism by continuing to buy stocks in  companies  whose near-termearnings prospects  would not seem  to justify their purchase.Elsewhere in  the economy, the  effects of the  world slowdown  are evident.Agricultural  prices  and exports are  suffering.  Manufacturing  is feeling the difficulty, laying  offsome people,  and beginning  to pull back  on expansion  plans.  Investors  are  still wary  of anyrisky venture despite some melting of the frozen  capital  markets  of a few  weeks  ago.The  elves have to do their job and we have  to do ours.  I believe  that most of the signspoint,  as the Greenbook  indicates, to a substantial  slowing  of the U.S. economy as we  go into1999.  We have  an extraordinary  responsibility  to make sure  that the  U.S. economy, as thelinchpin  of the  global  economic  system, does not slow  too much.  That is why I believe weshould take the  downside risks very seriously  and reinforce our last two easing  steps by takingone more today.  If we did not have the world depending on us, we could afford to wait and seewhether we  have done enough  already.  But the world still looks very fragile to  me, and whetherwe  like it or not, the U.S. economy is carrying  a heavy load in  the world's recovery.  Asia isbarely  turning up, if it is.  Russia  is a total disaster.  Western European  countries  seem  quitemyopic  in their preoccupation  with  their own  affairs, but they are  revising their forecasts  down.Latin America,  as  we  have discussed, seems extremely  fragile; there is hope but by no means  acertainty  of staving off disaster in Brazil  and  another round of contagion.  So, it does seem to methat we have to worry  a lot about that.11/17/98On the  other side,  I see  little downside  domestic  risk in worrying  too much  about ourresponsibilities  to the world.  Inflation  is not  a near-term  threat, although  we may  see  some  wageincreases.  The  stock market is clearly  a concern;  we might encourage  investors too much.  But Istill believe,  experience  notwithstanding,  that rationality will reassert  itself in the stock  market asearnings fall.  So, I think we have a  close question  today, and it may be a comforting  thought thatwe cannot do a  lot of harm.  On balance,  I see the risks on the downside,  especiallyinternationally,  and feel that we have a  special responsibility  to take  them very seriously.

MR.  BOEHNE.  Business  conditions  in  the Philadelphia region  have  been steadyoverall,  but there  is a continuing weakness  in  manufacturing.  Looking ahead, business contactsexpect  some  slight improvement in  economic  activity going into next  year, but there  is a cautioustone  to this forecast.  In the interest  of moving the  meeting along, I will  skip the District  details.Clearly,  the  national  economy  is currently  showing  a lot of resiliency,  given  theturmoil in  financial markets.  Perhaps  the economy  will escape  major damage  and continue tomove forward  at a healthy  clip.  The most likely  outlook, however, is for a slowing of growth  forthe reasons  already given, particularly  the international  ones.  In  short, the risks are on thedownside.  With inflationary pressures  subdued,  we  have the flexibility to take out someadditional  insurance  against excessive  weakness  in  demand.Financial markets have improved from their earlier unstable  condition, but  they are notyet back to normal.  We  need to continue  to facilitate  a return to normalcy.  Financial  marketscurrently are  like  a sick person  who feels  better after taking antibiotics  for a few  days but  stillneeds to stay on medication  to avoid  a relapse  and to  aid a return to good health.  In short, in11/17/98both  the real  sector and the  financial markets,  we  have downside risks  that, in my judgment, needto be counteracted.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Let  me  say a few  things  about the TenthDistrict.  The  regional  economy is  still  growing moderately.  There  are some  signs of slowing inthe data and in  some of the  anecdotal  reports  from business  contacts,  but the  degree to  whichgrowth  is slowing is not at  all  apparent.  Employment growth continues  to be steady in  ourDistrict,  although it is slightly behind the national economy.  Manufacturing  activity,  as  othershave reported  for their regions,  is slowing in our District as  well.  Our factory survey in Octoberwas flat.  On the other hand, retail  sales are  generally  good across the District,  and  some of ourretailers have  indicated that they  are anticipating  a very strong  holiday shopping  season.  Theconstruction  sector remains  generally  strong.  Some builders  are reporting  an easing of activitybut  one of our largest construction  firms,  which  is active in both the  Midwest and the PacificNorthwest, indicates  that some of this has been  due to  the REIT activity that  others have  talkedabout;  the  firm feels that reaction  probably has been  very  healthy in terms of stanching  some ofthe  excess that they  thought was building  in their markets.  Energy activity  remains  weak,obviously  due to the  low  oil and gas prices  and  the uncertainty  there.  Our agricultural  sector hastended  to  stabilize a little;  although  prices  are  still low,  they  have stabilized  and crop productionhas been  good.  There  has been  a recent  infusion  of funds by the Congress,  but my contacts  inboth ag and the  ag banking sector assure me that next  year certainly  will  be a disaster.  Despitesigns of slowing,  the District labor markets  are  still very tight.  More  than half of our Beigebookand business  contacts  are  talking about  raising wages  more than  what they  consider normal.Still,  we have  not seen the effect  on prices  in the District at all.11/17/98On  the national  front,  our outlook  and the Greenbook  are quite  different in  terms  ofthe projections  for  the next five  to  six quarters,  with  the  Greenbook  showing  a much  sharperquarter, the Greenbook  has five  quarters  of below-trend  growth  whereas  we have  growth  in linewith trend or slightly below.  As  a result, we have  a less  favorable  inflation  outlook,  although  wedo not anticipate  that inflation  will  be  a substantial  problem.We think the risks are  more balanced  than  they were  at the time of the  last meeting.We  believe that the financial  markets  are  more stable  and are  pricing more realistically.  Wethink domestic  demand  is remaining  fairly  stable,  and it could  actually be stronger  depending  onthe  stock market  and other factors  because,  as others  have reported, consumer  confidence  isrelatively high.  On  the  downside,  manufacturing  could  slow more than we're  expecting,especially given  the international  uncertainty.  But  on balance,  we think that it would be  prudent,given  that there  are  only five weeks  to the next meeting,  to wait  and watch in this intermeetingperiod.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  The  SecondDistrict economy  is  slowing.  The manufacturing  sector in northern  New  Jersey and westernNew York is  participating  in the general  slowing of manufacturing nationally  and the growth  inthe service  sector is  not sufficient  to  make  up for it.  The housing  area is  also somewhat  weaker.Commercial  construction  is  slowing, largely  because of restricted availability  of credit.  Retailsales were weak in  September  and bounced back some in  October and early  November.Nationally,  I believe  that the  Greenbook has  it about right.  Like the Greenbook,  wesee economic  growth  well  below  trend in  1999, with  recovery to  something more like  trend11/17/98growth  in 2000.  Inflation  is clearly well  controlled.  We think that the weakness  in  fixed incomeWhen  we look at the  likely pressure  on the banking  sector, it is worth  remembering  that about 25percent of C&I  loans come from the  money center banks and about  another 25  percent comefrom foreign  banks operating in the United States.  Both the  money center banks  and the foreignbanks are  dependent, just as  their commercial customers  are,  on purchased  money.  We believethat  year-end pressure  on  the money center banks, which  they are very concerned  about andalready are seeing, could  well exacerbate  the problem in fixed income markets.  Certainly,  thepressure that the money center banks will face will be  more than that experienced  by  the foreignbanks.Consequently,  I think there is  a possibility, not a probability  but a distinct possibility,that the  month  of December could be a particularly  difficult  one and that the problems in  thefinancial  sector  could mean that Main Street,  which  has  been holding up very  resiliently as  manyhave pointed out, will be  adversely  affected.  Therefore,  I believe  that the risk coming from thedomestic economy and the considerable  risk  coming from the foreign  sector indicate  that theGreenbook forecast, whose growth in  1999  I would not  find adequate,  is more likely than not thebetter of the cases that we can expect.  Thus, the downside risk  is still  very considerable  andpoints  to the need  for some additional  action on  our part.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  As we have  already  heard, there aresignificant  and reasonable  scenarios  on both  sides  of this discussion.  On the one hand,  we canbelieve that the most  recent strength  in  the real  economy will abate, but just slightly, and that theeconomy  that has  surprised  us on  the upside  time and again  will continue to do so.  In this11/17/98reality, labor  and households  reign  supreme.  GDP growth  comes in  for a  soft landing  withoutfurther help from monetary policy.  After all,  one might  say, in the third quarter the  economygrew  at an  annual rate  of 3.3  percent.  Household  spending  is  still growing  about 4 percent.  Thisstrong growth is  fueled by jobs--as some have  indicated,  labor markets  are still tight--and  wageand  salary growth, and  credit.In  the optimistic  scenario,  financial  markets are described  as fragile but recovering.The stock market  continues  to defy reasonable  analysis  and gives  added  impetus to consumerspending,  and possibly  to capital  spending.  Most  importantly in  this optimistic  scenario,  Asiaalready has turned  the corner and Brazil avoids the worst outcomes  due to timely internationalintervention.For me this picture is  very,  very attractive,  but I'm  afraid that it reflects  only a limitedreality.  I believe  that growth  due to  labor and household consumption,  which underpins  the mostpositive scenario,  is limited.  Job creation  does seem  to have  slowed considerably  of late.Secondly,  I note that last quarter's  GDP growth  was heavily  fueled by inventories, which  seemsunlikely  to repeat.  Finally, in  what I describe  as the  more pessimistic  scenario,  there  is a greatfocus  on capital  and capital  investment.  Business fixed investment fell in the  last quarter atabout a  1 percent annual  rate, which  I think is the first decline  of that magnitude  since  1990  or1991; BFI admittedly  was retarded  by nonresidential  construction,  but even investment  inproducers'  durable equipment barely budged.More  disturbingly,  anecdotal  and  survey  evidence  suggests that capital  spending plansfor many firms  have been revised  downward.  This slowdown  reflects  a realization  that profitsindicated,  financial  markets  are  still uncertain.  In  any event,  businesses  may decide  they do not11/17/98need  to add  to their capital budgets  because  inventories are  adequate  and export orders arelagging.  It is this that I think brings the Greenbook home.  So,  in this  pessimistic  scenario,  onewould say  financial markets  have not yet returned to normal  liquidity and risk spreads,  and stockFinally, the pessimistic  scenario involves  international  concerns  that have  been  alludedto by others.  Japan,  obviously  the largest economy in Asia, continues  to be mired in recession.Brazil's economic  performance  is  likely to be  weak.  I am concerned  that  its ability  to defendagainst devaluation,  were  that to be necessary,  is limited given  its reserve  position.  Finally, asothers have  indicated, China  may not prove to be as  strong as  the current official  numberssupport or suggest.So, we  have these  two scenarios.  The question  is which  one we believe.  If we believethe  optimistic one, obviously  monetary policy is probably properly  positioned now.  On  the  otherhand,  while it is  not at all a certainty, for my money the more pessimistic  scenario  does seem  alltoo possible.  If the  domestic  and international  components  of this scenario do come  to pass, theconsequences  for the  U.S. economy  are  dire.  The good news  in some  ways  is that we do nothave  to choose between  these  scenarios today.  Fortunately,  by most measures, inflation  issubdued  and likely to  stay so.  Just  as limitations  in pricing  limit corporate  spending, they alsolimit  the risk of inflation.  Therefore,  as I think at  least one other person has  said, we  can affordto buy some insurance at this time.  I think the premiums  are manageable.  I think the  risks of notbuying  some insurance  are just too great for my taste.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich.

MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While the most extrememanifestations  of the  credit crunch  have  abated, risk spreads  are still high,  and  the real federal11/17/98funds rate  is still  high also.  I think the period  of the credit crunch  is not entirely behind us.  I likeEd Boehne's metaphor on  that:  It's probably  a little too soon  to go  off the medication.On the forecast,  I have no complaints  with the  Greenbook.  The numbers  show thatfinal  sales  already  have  gone down to  below  trend,  and the Greenbook  forecast has the GDPfalling below trend.  I think we all recognize  it, but  let me repeat that  that is with  an assumedfurther cut in the federal  funds rate.  Even  then, there is a fairly prolonged period  where  GDP isbelow trend,  with unemployment  rising above  5  percent.There  are not as  many risks on the downside  this time  around, partly  because ofactions  that we already have  taken.  But I think there  are still two.  One  is the  stock market.Even  though the Greenbook  forecast does program in  some decline  in the  stock market, it is notthat great  a decline  and it could be more significant  if the likely effects  of the  earnings  forecastscome to pass.  The second  is the foreign troubles,  about  which we  have talked  a lot.  KarenJohnson  gave the pessimistic  Brazil  forecast  a significant probability;  as I remember it was 30percent or so.  If we look at that  forecast, we do  have a fairly  soft GDP situation.On the inflation side, I am beginning  to feel  as if I  am in the  audience  of the play,Waiting  for Godot.  We have  had steady  unemployment  at below  5  percent for seven  quartersnow, and  the signs of acceleration  of inflation still  are  not much  more visible  now than they  werethen.  I don't know  what is  going on here;  it is possible that the natural  rate model  should beamended,  and it is possible that  5-1/2  percent is the wrong  estimate  of the NAIRU.  I  don't knowwhat the latter is, but I think the paucity of signs  of accelerating  inflation this  long into a periodof unemployment under 5 percent is really quite striking.We rarely  discuss fiscal  policy at these meetings.  In  fact, I don't think I have everheard it discussed.  But let me bring  that up because  there is  increasing talk in Washington  of11/17/98dealing  with  a recession,  if it comes, either on the  spending side  by having  some more  spendingor on the tax  cut  side.  My view of what macro  textbooks  used to call the  assignment  problem  inan era of flexible exchange  rates  is that the proper role of monetary policy should be to stabilizethe  economy  and the proper role  of fiscal  policy should be  to worry  about the overall nationalsaving rate, which  is very  low in  this country and should not be lowered  still further byexpansionary  fiscal  policy.  At this  point, I will  switch  to Bob McTeer's  analogy  and  say that theright course is for us to  keep control  of the  firetrucks.My last point is that one  very clear advantage  of monetary policy is its flexibility.  Itstrikes me  that things are  still  a little soft.  I would still  like to see a little more  adjustment,through the  "use  of water"  in Bob's analogy.  This may prove not to be  the right thing to do, butif it proves  not to be  right, we can  observe that  and act accordingly.  So, I believe the flexibilityof monetary policy gives  us a degree  of freedom here,  and I would like to see us use  it. Thankyou.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start off by focusing  on what Ithink has changed  and what has  remained the same  in the  outlook  since the  last meeting  andparticularly  since  the  intermeeting  move.  First, the second half looks stronger, with  growth  at orabove trend.  This reflects  both the surprise  in third-quarter  GDP  and the general  resilience  in thespending  data.  Second, I think the forecast going  forward has  been bolstered by  depreciation ofthe  dollar and particularly  since our intermeeting  move  by the resurgence  in equity prices  andsome relaxation  in financial  stress.  Third, the announcement  of the Brazil package  and someother developments  in the international  realm  have  added  at least a bit of optimism  that the worsecase scenario for global  turmoil might be  avoided.11/17/98What has remained  the  same?  I think the general  answer is the qualitative  forecastgoing forward.  It still  appears that growth  will be clearly  below  trend next  year, though somemodest upward revision  along the  lines of the  Greenbook forecast appears justified.  It stillappears  that inflation will  remain  well contained.  And  it still appears  that downside  riskspredominate  though perhaps  less so than before.  I think the main difference  is that there  isrenewed  appreciation  of some  upside risk going forward.Why so little change  in the forecast?  First, I think the upward revision  to the thirdquarter was concentrated  so heavily in inventory  investment  that it is more  likely to be reversedthan extrapolated going  forward.  Second,  the rebound  in equity prices  appears  to beincompatible  with a forecast  of slowing  growth  and declining  profits, and therefore it also islikely  to be  reversed  going forward.  Third, while the  depreciation  of the  dollar is  certainly  apositive,  its  effect is  offset by some further  slowdown  in foreign  growth,  as in the  Greenbookforecast.  Finally,  while the financial  stress has been  partially unwound, financial  conditions,  atleast  outside of equity markets,  have nevertheless  significantly  deteriorated  since July.Here  is how I  would characterize  the broad qualitative features  of the outlook.  First,private  domestic  demand  appears  to have  decelerated to  about a 4 percent growth  rate  in thesecond half from the  8 percent rate in the first half, returning to its average  rate  over the previoustwo years.  This is very  consistent with the gravity  story that I told earlier.  A further slowing inprivate domestic  demand,  as in the Greenbook  forecast, toward roughly  a trend rate  over  1999looks plausible.  This partly reflects  a  diminished  stimulus  from the wealth  effect, assumingequity prices do not rise further, and  it reflects,  in addition, the effect of the recent deteriorationin financial  conditions  along with the projected  further correction  in equity prices.  This  spreadsthe effects  of global turmoil from the external  to  the domestic  sector.  Given  the  slowdown in11/17/98private  domestic  demand,  even the slower rate  of decline in net exports  over  1999  is  enough  topush overall  growth below  trend.  The  slowdown  is reinforced  over the next couple of quartersby a reduction  in  inventory investment  from  its unsustainable  third-quarter pace.  I think it is  alsoreasonable to anticipate  that growth  will  rebound to about  trend in  the  year 2000.I  would put my best guess of growth  next year just a  shade higher than in theGreenbook forecast,  but  I  would also take into  account the  still  asymmetric  downside  risk that Isee to that baseline  in  setting monetary  policy.  I'm a little less  optimistic  about the course ofnominal  wage change  and a bit more concerned about  the size  and inflationary  effect  of thedepreciation  of the dollar than  is the Greenbook,  but I still believe inflation  will  be wellcontained.I think what  we do  at this  meeting is  a close call.  But were we to move one  moretime,  which I would support,  it would seem  to me that that would bring  to a conclusion thecumulative  adjustment in  monetary  policy that seems  appropriate  in light of the discrete changein  the  outlook that has occurred.  We  should find some way to perhaps  signal  that as  well. Thankyou.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I will bat cleanup here.  The fundamentalworldview  of hawks  and doves  is always evolving,  but I do think that both  of those birds  arealive and well.  To oversimplify,  a hawk's  view  of policy today  might well be that, with the U.S.economy  strong and the  world's financial  structure shaky, our policy  should be to insure  that ourfinancial  system remains a rock-solid anchor to  windward.  That is the best  thing that we  can  doto help both the  world and ourselves,  hence  a bias toward  firmness.  A  dove's focus might be onthe U.S.  economy as  the engine  whose forward  drive is essential  to the world's  stability and11/17/98recovery,  and U.S.  policy  should insure that that engine  stays in high gear,  hence  a bias towardease.I find much  that is  appealing in both of these  arguments  and I don't want to have tochoose  one  path over the other.  Fortunately,  if we  stay focused on  the  same mission  that  wehave  pursued for so long--namely,  seeking maximum  sustainable growth fostered  by price  levelstability--I  think we  can reasonably  seek both of those objectives,  and the best policy,  as  before,still  lies there.How  do we identify  that policy path?  As always,  that comes  from assessing the risksand trying to determine how  strong they  are and where  the balance  lies.  I believe  the balance  ofrisks  has migrated  to the  downside,  particularly  as it relates to the likely timing  of potentialshocks.  To be sure, upside risks remain  and could  readily resume  their dominance  of only just afew months  ago.  First of all, of course,  our primary concern  for many  quarters  now is still  withus.  Economic  activity is still  very strong, labor markets  are still  very tight,  and that means  thatinflation is  still  a major potential  threat.  But I believe  that that scenario  is of diminishedprobability for  all of the reasons with  which we are familiar.  The good news  timing-wise  is thatif we should see  that scenario  evolving,  its latent risks  should materialize  slowly enough  for us tohave time to counter them if need be.I worry  more today about  the potential  for very serious  mischief that could arise  in thestock market if it should boom to  new highs.  That could put  us in  severe jeopardy of a crash  thatcould bring down  a great  deal more of the world and, indeed, our own  economy  with it.  Myhope is that,  as a  slowing economy  results in declining corporate  earnings,  this market  willself-correct  in  an orderly  way.  However,  a real crash  has too high  a probability to  give me  muchcomfort, and easier policy may heighten  the chances  of a plunge in the market.11/17/98The  downside risks seem  to be growing  and, perhaps  of even  more importance,  couldburgeon  much  more quickly, perhaps  severely  and without much  warning.  The  internationalrisks,  we know,  certainly  have those  characteristics.  There could well  be others  yet to unfold  inthis dynamic  environment.  That the U.S.  economy is slowing  seems to be a  growing probability.While  that may be desirable within  limits,  once a  downward trend gains momentum, it is hard toknow how  far and fast it may go and  what it might take to  arrest a decline  if that becomesnecessary.  In  today's world, I think that  is a more than  usually important  factor.I do think we should keep  a wary eye  on deflation.  There  are  some signs that itsimpetus may be  slowing,  but in the context  of an increasingly  sluggish U.S  economy, if that iswhat should ensue,  it could become a real  danger.To sum up, Mr. Chairman,  I do  not believe that we are  behind the curve,  but I dobelieve  that the ground is  shifting.  Perhaps  we need to shift a bit more  with it.  I see little reasonto  wait as any  upside  risk would likely emerge  rather slowly over time, whereas the existingdownside risks could  appear suddenly  and  soon.  The respective  time frames  are quiteasymmetric.  My mother used to  say "a stitch  in  time saves nine."  We have  taken  two so far, andthree  might do it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank  you very much.  We now can move on to DavidLindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The Committees's  choicetoday  would seem to boil down  to standing  pat or easing by another 25  basispoints.  The Committee's last two  easing actions  were of a preemptivenature,  taken to ward off undesirable  economic  weakness  prospectively,  asopposed to being  based  on softer economic  data already  in hand.  Theeconomic  data received  since the  last FOMC meeting,  while  somewhatmixed, would not necessarily  alter that perspective.  That  is, they continue  topaint a picture  of satisfactory real  growth looking backward, turning into asignificant slowing  in the  future.  The inflation  outlook is little changed.  In11/17/98the staff forecast,  credit  market  stresses  gradually  unwind  further in comingquarters,  but conditions  do not return to their earlier lax  state,  while stockprices  move back down,  damping spending.  Financial  problems are notpredicted to intensify in Latin  America.Because  resources  gradually  return to a more  sustainable  utilization ratewhile the rise  in inflation  is limited, the Committee  could  well find the  staffforecast  to be  an  acceptable  outcome.  The Committee  also could  considerthe forecast to be plausible  as a point  estimate.  Ironically,  the staff forecastcan be read as  providing  support for either  standing pat or for easing  slightlyat this meeting.  The Greenbook  forecast  assumes  one more quarter point ofpolicy ease  later this year.  Easing now  simply would move forward  thestaff's  assumed action  by a little  more than a month, while standing pat toawait  further information  on  the impact of previous  policy easings could stillaccord  with deferring  an easing until  the next meeting as  assumed in  thestaff forecast.  Of course, these  two courses of action would presumablyhave basically  indistinguishable  macroeconomic  effects,  assuming nodisproportionate  differential  impact on financial  markets.  For that matter,the outlook presumably  would not be altered greatly if there were  no furtherquarter  point easing  at all, again absent  an unusually adverse  financialhinge, as many  have pointed out already,  on its  assessment  of where theforecast  could go wrong--that  is, on where  the most important  risks to theforecast  may reside.In the present  circumstances,  several  areas of possible downsidesurprises  come to  mind, and they could provide  a rationale  for the quarterpoint  easing of alternative  A.  Despite  the support package  put together forBrazil, that country, as  well as  others in  Latin America, could  be furtheraffected  by financial  contagion, as  Karen has noted.  Closer to home,potentially sizable  further losses could be  felt by key banks  and otherplayers in our financial  markets.  Also,  the projected decline in corporateprofits could foster a greater stock market correction  than the staff has  builtinto its forecasts of consumption  and investment spending.The still  tender state  of other securities  markets means  that the reversalof extreme  risk aversion  since the mid-October  policy easing is  stillincomplete  and  somewhat tentative.  This condition has raised the concernin some  market circles  that a decision  not to  ease today could be enough  of adisappointment  to market participants  to spark a short-circuiting  of therecovery in risk spreads  and trading  conditions.  This  concern  has lost someforce  with the recent scaling back  of expectations  of Fed easing.  Theprobability of easing at this meeting built into fed funds futures quotes  hasreceded  from more than two-thirds two weeks  ago to somewhat  better thaneven odds  as of yesterday, in part because  financial market stresses  have11/17/98continued to unwind  on  balance.  Even  so,  as  the Bluebook  discussionsuggested,  not easing  today probably  would induce some immediatewidening of risk  spreads, as  private  rates  back up more than rates  onTreasuries,  especially  those  "on the run."  Some increase in  liquiditypremiums,  and  shrinkage  in trading  volumes,  also could be  expected tooccur right away.  But on the  assumption  that markets  still  will perceive  theFederal  Reserve  as  closely  monitoring financial  developments  and preparedto ease  again  if necessary to  head off any reversion  to  extremely  unsettledconditions,  the adverse  market reaction is  likely to be essentially limited inscope  and duration.Another, perhaps  related, concern  that might add  support to alternativeA has to  do with the  likelihood of unusually  severe  year-end financingpressures, especially  for borrowing  institutions  not viewed  as being oftop-notch  credit quality.  Already  some commercial  banks have reportedrestricting their interbank  lending to  certain domestic  institutions  and toJapanese  and, to a lesser extent, European  counterparties  generally.  AsPeter noted, banks also have tended  to shorten the  maturity  of theirinterbank loans to  overnight.  In the  commercial  paper market,  contractsextending over the  turn of the  year now embody  a  substantial  interest ratepremium.  Although  a policy easing  may not appreciably affect  the extent  ofyear-end-related  increases  in rates  on loans  and securities  in  the moneythose pressures  would operate,  muting some  of the  adverse effects  on creditcosts for affected parties.A phenomenon  likely to  be longer  lasting is the firming of conditionson  bank  loans to nonfinancial  borrowers.  A large  share of commercial bankrespondents to  the November  Senior Loan Officer  Opinion Survey reportedtightening  standards  and terms  for C&I loans to large- and middle-marketbusinesses  and for commercial  real  estate loans.  Evidence  also surfaced inthat  survey of some,  though  less pronounced,  firming of standards and  termsfor small businesses.  And large commercial  banks  on balance  have  seen  anappreciable  rise in their costs of funds in capital  markets.  The  staff does notforesee  much further deterioration  of credit  availability  through banks, butthe Committee may consider this possibility as a nontrivial  risk to  theeconomic  outlook.  Certainly, the  episode of the  early  1990s  vividlydemonstrated  that a credit  crunch can involve the  banking  sector  and thataggressive  easing  can be a necessary  monetary policy response.  However, Ithink some important differences  between  that earlier episode  and thepresent situation  suggest that this credit influence  could easily be overstatedin today's  context.  Banks then were  partly motivated to restrict  theirlending by impaired capital  positions  that needed rebuilding.  Today, banksare  generally much  better capitalized.  Then, actual  loan  growth was quitesluggish,  while  today it has been  rapid.  And, finally,  then the  growth  of the11/17/98broad monetary  aggregates  was  anemic.  Now, although  admittedly  thevelocity of M2 has been dropping  since mid-1997,  the quite rapid  growth ofthis  aggregate,  especially  of late,  is at least worth  a passing  mention.The strong  growth  of the monetary  aggregates,  including M3,  may besuggestive  of upside risks more  broadly to  the staff forecast, emphasis  onwhich  would enhance  the attractiveness  of alternative  B.  Even with  anunchanged  funds rate,  financing conditions  may normalize  more  promptlythan in the staff forecast.  Moreover,  the possibility that a policy easingcould  spur a further run-up of equity prices--in  contrast to the Greenbookforecast  of a  decline--that  could combine  with the recent rebound inconsumer confidence  to impart  added  impetus to spending, may  strengthenthe case for staying the Fed's hand at this meeting.  Also, in  light of thesupport  package  for Brazil  and the recent narrowing  of Brady  spreads,  theglobal  financial  crisis may mend more rapidly than we  can reasonablyassume now.  For these and other reasons,  the extent  of the output slowdownthat is predicted  by the staff is not a  foregone conclusion.  Finally, thestronger-than-expected  third-quarter  employment cost index  against thebackdrop  of still tight labor  markets may be viewed  as  highlighting the riskof higher inflation.  If the Committee  places much  weight on theseconsiderations,  it may wish to adopt a  "wait-and-see"  posture--standing  patuntil more  actual  evidence of a slowing economy  shows itself.But given the staff's prediction  that such  a  slowdown is  impending, ifthe Committee  chooses  not to  act today, it may still wish  to maintain anasymmetric  tilt toward ease.  The Committee  also may want to keep the tilttoward ease if it does  decide to ease.  Alternatively,  it may judge  that aprompt  further easing  would bring the risks  to the economic  outlook intobalance.  If so, the Committee may decide  not to go on record  as  suggestingthat further decreases  in the funds rate  are  an especially  likely prospect.Mr. Chairman, that concludes my briefing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank  you.  Questions  for David?  If not, let me getstarted.  This is a more difficult call than that at the  last meeting.  There is very  little questionthat there  has  been considerable  easing in  a number of the areas  where  we  are concerned.  Theone  area where  things have eased regrettably  more than I  would have  liked is the  stock market.In  a certain  sense that has created  a major question  in  my judgment  as to  whether  we shouldmove.  If the Dow Jones  industrial  average  were  200 to 300  points lower, I  think the case for11/17/98moving one  additional  time and then  putting policy  on indefinite  hold  would be fairly  strong fora  number of the  reasons  that have  already been  discussed today, as  well as  additional  ones  that Iwould  like to raise.  I do not think that inflation  has become  a problem; if anything, it is thereverse.  I do think the concerns  about  an asset bubble are  not without  validity,  and that is whereI have my  greatest concerns  about easing.Let me first, however, address the  inflation  issue.  The crucial  question  we have  to askourselves is how  we  should measure  inflation.  If we look at the  core  CPI, it has  clearlyaccelerated  in the last year  or so and at the moment  is running in the  area of somewhat under  a2-1/2  percent annual  rate.  In contrast, the core PCE has been decelerating  fairly  dramatically  anddepending  on whether we  are using 3-month,  6-month, or 12-month  rolling averages,  theincrease is barely  more  than  1 percent.  More  than half of the  difference in these  measures  ofcore  inflation reflects the  difference in  the weights  for housing.  As  you know,  owners'equivalent rent is  over 20 percent  of the CPI and total housing is close  to  30 percent,  as I recall.In the PCE, they are  about half that.  The difference  occurs to  a substantial  extent  as aconsequence of two elements.  First, the weight in the CPI is based  on individuals'  views of thepotential rental  value of the  houses  in which  they live.  In the PCE, it is derived from moredetailed macro  data.  Second, the  scope  of the PCE  is much broader  in that  it covers  a  muchwider  area  of consumer  expenditures  and obviously,  other things equal that would lower theweight for housing  in the  PCE.  So even  though the  actual  price changes  for housing and owners'equivalent rent are  close in  both the PCE and the CPI, the mere  difference  in the weights  and thefact  that housing  costs  are rising faster than average  has  created  a very dramatic  widening  in thespread between  CPI  core inflation  and PCE core inflation,  which now is  1-1/2 percentage  points.11/17/98I seriously question  whether housing  should be  a component of any measure ofunderlying  inflation.  I don't want to get too involved in  this, but I think all the other  measuresthat we  are looking  at--the PPI, the intermediate prices,  the commodity  prices, the data from thepurchasing managers--are  all suggesting,  in  my judgment,  that the inflation rate is still  falling.To put it another way, the real  funds rate is rising.When  we look at the unit cost structure for nonfinancial  corporations,  which I havediscussed on numerous occasions  before,  we get  a  similar story.  Average  hourly compensationfor that  sector, and that measure  is  more relevant than the ECI for the  analysis of unit costs, hasaccelerated  somewhat  but so has output per hour for nonfinancial  corporations.  Theconsequence  is that unit  labor costs have been rising  at a rate of less  than  1-1/2 percent in recentquarters  and total  unit costs, which  include declining  unit nonlabor costs,  have been  increasing ata shade  above  1 percent.  With corporate  prices  generally  stable,  this implies  a decline  in profitthe  past year.The importance  of these data,  as best I can judge, is that  they suggest underlyinginflationary forces  are continuing  to recede despite the  tightness in labor markets.  I would pointout that there is  very little  evidence that those markets  are tightening  further at this  time, but Ialso would not want to argue that we are seeing any  significant  labor market  easing.  Themeasure  that I have found most useful  recently in measuring the  degree  of labor markettightness,  the sum of those who  are unemployed  and those who are not in the  labor force butwould like a job, fell  quite rapidly from  1995 through  1997  but stabilized at the beginning  of thisyear  and since then has  moved hardly at  all.  In addition,  the  diffusion  indexes in the payroll11/17/98employment  series are clearly  falling very  sharply, suggesting  that the recent slowdown  has beenwidespread  across industries.In  any event,  it is the case that the price pressures and the  wage  pressures  are notbehaving  the way they have in  the past  under comparable  circumstances.  Something  different isgoing on.  It is this  overall  downward pressure,  which  I think is coming to a great extent  frominternational  forces, that clearly has undercut to a substantial  extent the pricing  power ofmanufacturing  industries.  As you know, these prices  have been  weakening  quite measurably inrecent months.I think the pressure  on profit margins  is beginning to affect capital  investment.  Manyof the company executives to whom I speak and much of the secondary information that I pickup from a number of different company  sources clearly  indicate that there is  a scaling back ofcapital  appropriations.  It  is not very  large as  yet, but obviously  something is very graduallyexerting  downward pressure.  The underlying  diminished  growth,  which I think is fundamentallybeing  caused  by the squeeze  on margins,  has not yet shown  up in the  consumer areas, as best Ican judge.  Consumer markets  continue to be strong, and the wealth  effect has not yet had ameasurable  damping  effect.  Motor vehicle  sales,  which were  sharply higher in October  largelybecause  of incentives,  have  eased some  this month,  as Mike  Moskow  indicated.  Officials  fromthe auto  companies  whom we talked to the other day  all suggested that  sales are running  belowexpectations, but I think their expectations  are  probably quite high.  Having said all  that, I thinkthe likelihood  that consumer  spending  will  continue to grow  rapidly is somewhat  questionable.We do have  a continued  high level of housing sales; I see no real  evidence that they aredeteriorating,  but there also is no evidence  of a pickup.  There has been  some backing  up ofinventories.11/17/98There  also is  the broad  and  very important question of the financial  issues.  It certainlyis the case that yield spreads  and risk aversion,  which  had been  quite substantial  through Octoberand have  eased quite measurably  in the  last several  weeks,  have stopped easing.  In  fact, thereactually  has been  some minor upturn,  especially  on commercial  paper, and I have run into thesame issues that Bill McDonough  has raised  with respect to  year-end effects.  I think we  arebeginning to see some  potential year-end  effects emerging  in  the banking area.  To be  sure, theweakening  in the availability  of funds in the capital markets  has spilled over into  the commercialbanking sector, and we have  seen a  very dramatic  acceleration  of C&I and  other lendinggenerally.  A number of banks are quite unhappy  about having  to  accommodate  this  additionalloan  demand largely  because,  as  you know, they have backup  lines on  commercial  paper thatwere  issued and priced  on the  assumption that the lines would never be used.  If you  speak tobanks, especially  the  money center banks, it is by no means  clear that they are  eager toaccommodate the  spillover in loan demand from the capital markets.  As a consequence,  I thinkthe presumption that we are going  to  see a  gradual return  to full and fluid capital markets  is onlya hope  at this  stage and a hope that I don't think is about to materialize very quickly.I must say that  the risks in the Brazil  situation  are significant.  The meeting  thatoccurred  yesterday  in New  York seemed to suggest that the American  banks  were  going to  behelpful in  stabilizing Brazil's  funding.  Having spoken to a number  of them fairly  recently,  Ihave the impression that  each will participate  only if everyone  else does.  At the first sign thatthat will  not the case,  they will back off.  I judge the risks  here at close to  50/50, maybe a  littleless.  I'm a shade  less  optimistic than Karen  Johnson  on this, but I grant  that conditions  haveimproved from where they were.  Three  weeks ago,  I would have  said that the Brazilian situationwas really dangerous.  Since then it has improved  to close  to 50/50  in my view,  but it strikes  me11/17/98that maintaining  the Brazilian exchange  rate is going  to be very difficult.  An exchange  rate thatis under pressure  from 40 or 30 percent  interest rates,  capital  account  deficits,  and programs  thatare  presumably very  good on the fiscal  side suggests  that something  is not right.  I am  a  littleconcerned that we have not yet  seen  the worst of this.I  agree with Mike  Kelley  on how  one  evaluates  all of this.  If we  move rates  down  andwe  are wrong, it will be very easy  to move them back up.  With the inflation  rates where  they areand  the real funds  rate where it is, the question  is more  an issue of where the rate should berather than  whether it should be going up or down.  As best I can judge, the funds  rate thatappears  to be appropriate  in current  circumstances,  with  all the risks we have talked  about, iscloser to 4  percent than  it is to 5  percent.  My judgment  at this stage--and  I  grant you that it isnot a clear-cut  call in  all respects--is  that if we hold steady  at this time  and things begin  todeteriorate  and we then move  the funds rate down,  we  would look  as though  we are  behind thecurve  and  are reacting  to  events,  and that could create  a  very unfavorable  atmosphere  in theindicate  that we are  on hold.  I think the clear thing to do at  this point is to move  down  and gosymmetric,  largely  because  the  economy  is in fact  doing reasonably  well.  The extent  ofdeterioration  is modest.  I believe  we  are moving  to a slower path  of economic  growth  and apotentially less  inflationary  environment, but  there could be a far more  deleterious  outcomeahead and I  agree with  many of you that a little  insurance  at this  stage is probably  wise.  The  costof the  insurance  is very  small,  and I suspect  it is probably  not a bad thing at this stage  to take outthe insurance  but then  to  stop at that point,  stay on hold, and watch  events as they  materializeover the  weeks  and possibly even  months  ahead.  At that point, we would be poised to move11/17/98rates lower if necessary, but there is no  obvious  need in my judgment  to be assuming  such  amove  at this time.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree fully  andrather enthusiastically  with your recommendation.  One might  wonder why those of us who havetalked about year-end  pressures  would find symmetry  appropriate.  The reason  I do is that if wehave severe  year-end pressures  and  have to react,  the need would be  so obvious that there  wouldnot be  a whole lot of debate.  I am hopeful that that will not be necessary.  Therefore,  I thinksymmetry is the right answer.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, I agree  with  you that this  is a  tough call but  let mejust get the other point  of view on the table.  As I see it after listening  to all of this, there  are twoprincipal  arguments  for easing  policy today.  One  is  the downside  risks  in the economy,  thepossibility that the  actual  outcome will  be weaker than  the  Greenbook projection.  The  other isthe need to act to prevent  a reemergence  of the extreme  risk aversion  of a  few  weeks  ago.  I justrespectfully  do not believe that either of those two arguments is  very compelling today.  Theydevelopments  and a lot that we  have heard  around the table this morning suggest that growthOn  the other point, it seems to  me that the financial  system is adjusting,  as a number  ofpeople  have said, and working  reasonably  well.  In  a  situation like  this, there is always atremendous  bias  and pressure  on the Fed to do  something.  But I would point out that we arealready doing  something even if we don't reduce the  funds rate today.  Just  given the  way we11/17/98operate,  we are  providing additional  liquidity  to meet  the additional  demand  for it and  at a 50basis point lower price than that  liquidity was  being provided just a few  weeks  ago.One  other point I  would make is that I see some risk in moving today because it isalways  difficult  to tighten  monetary policy.  With  all respect,  I think it might  be difficult tochange  our policy  course and  it might be hard to  do it as  quickly as we would like.  Given all  ofthat, I would have  a strong preference  for alternative B.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR.  FERGUSON.  Mr. Chairman,  I support both halves of your recommendation.  Ibelieve  that we have  achieved much  of our goals  from the two earlier policy easings.  CreditPresident Broaddus  had to  say, some may ask why we should not wait until  December, given  thepossibility of further  improvement.  My answer to that question is  that if we do not take thisopportunity to complete our work, we risk losing the advantage  that we have now.  I amconcerned  that if we  do not act,  the  markets  may return  to their very disturbed  state  of a fewweeks  ago.  That would then require us to adjust policy, perhaps  by larger  amounts and perhapsagain  in an intermeeting  move.  If contrary  to my expectation,  the easing  proves to be premature,I do think we can  undo it.  I believe the move to symmetry is  an important  internal  signal that weare prepared  to  go either way if the facts so  indicate.  That is why I support  symmetry  as  well.Finally, as  you have pointed out,  given the direction of inflation,  we perhaps havetightened  passively.  The tightening  was  appropriate  earlier in the  year, but I am now in favor ofthe  proposed easing and moving to symmetry.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.11/17/98

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  As I noted in my earlier comments,  after a difficult  balancingprocess in thinking about this, I came to this meeting clearly  in favor of waiting to  see whathappens  for the rest of this quarter  and considering  a possible move in  December.  I have listenedvery  carefully to all of the  arguments.  I do  believe  that we face  some risks  that relate  to theebullience  in the  stock market  and the  feedback  from rising levels of stock market prices intoconsumer  confidence  and  spending.  Sooner or later, that is going to come to a halt.  I think weare all in  agreement on that.  The prospects for profit margins just are  not  where they were earlierin this cycle.  Sooner or later, reason  is  going to prevail.  Governor  Kelley's comments  earlier onthat topic were right  along the  line of my thinking.  If the stock  market does not go a  whole lothigher, we are  better off than if it does because  eventually  the rise will  come  to a halt  and theoverall  impact on the economy  will  be  worse at  that time.  So, I think that  is one of the risks weface  if we move  at a  time when  a  lot of the basic  signals  from  the domestic  economy, the realeconomy,  are  showing resilience  if not strength,  which almost everybody  has commented  on.I  also think that almost everything  that has  happened  since our last monetary policymove--the  intermeeting ease  that I think was  extremely well  done in  the sense  of getting theat this point to  be thinking about  a further easing  of policy  against a lot of the positivedevelopments,  although  all of them involve  a significant  degree of downside risk.  I  see a processwhere easing now  creates  a risk in the short term that things could get a  little beyond us.Whereas  over the longer  term, if the  slowdown  in the expansion  occurs  and if financialconditions  turn  more negative than we  expect,  we might  see  more of a  downward ratcheting  ofthe  economy  than if we  had not moved.11/17/98Those  are my basic  concerns.  My thinking is more in line with  that of PresidentBroaddus,  but I  am not going to dissent  because  I think it's a close  call.  The people who  arecloser to the  markets  than I are  worried  about year-end  financing and overall  fragility  anduncertainty,  and I know that has been  factored  into your thinking  as well, Mr. Chairman.  Thereis something to  be listened to there,  so I  will  support your proposal  to ease,  but I am nervousabout  it.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  It seems  to me that we have been  playingcatch-up  to a discrete  change in the  outlook.  The question  today is whether  we have caught up,and if not, whether we  should complete  the likely  further move sooner rather  than later.  It isclear from the discussion  around  the table  today that it is a close  call.  On balance,  my judgmentis that another quarter point move would complete  what I think would be an appropriateadjustment  to the discrete  change in the outlook.  Because  the slowdown  is projected to  bearound the corner, a case can be made that the additional  easing  should be sooner rather thanlater.  These considerations  lead me to support your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman, to  cut thefunds rate  a quarter point today and return  to a symmetric  directive.  The move to a  symmetricdirective  signals the  pause that I believe is in order after the move and highlights  the possibilitythat the move may have  completed an appropriate  response to the  change in the  outlook.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  as I mentioned in my comments, I think the  risksclearly are  on the  downside.  I agree with others  that this is a close call.  Coming into the meetingI agonized  over this, but I came to the conclusion  that we are either going  to move  now or inunsustainable  rate, but it is relatively easy to imagine  scenarios  where  growth is going to slowabruptly.  So, I  felt that  we definitely would  move at one  of these  two meetings,  and therefore wemight  as well do it now.  I don't see  any reason  to wait.  Inflationary  pressures  appear  to bemodest.  There  is  an opportunity  to balance  the risks now by lowering  the funds rate  by 25 basispoints.  When I  add in the Brazil  risk, which  I am very concerned about,  I agree  completely withyour recommendation  on both counts,  for a  25 basis  point reduction  and a  symmetrical directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I would prefer to  leave  the funds rate  unchanged at thepresent time for a couple  of reasons.  First, despite the forecast  to the contrary,  the economycontinued to show some  strength  in the  third quarter,  and the few  available  monthly data that wehave for the  current quarter indicate  solid growth.  Second,  I believe  that the chance  of arecession or major slowdown  in the economy  in the quarters  ahead has  been  significantlyreduced by recent financial  developments,  including  the two federal  funds rate  cuts.  I recognizethat prospects  for our economy  could change rather  suddenly  given the continuing vulnerabilityof our financial  markets  and of many foreign  economies.  While  this could require  another11/17/98change in policy  in the  near future, I would prefer to  retain  the  5  percent funds rate  for now alongwith the  asymmetry  toward  easing.

MR.  POOLE.  Mr. Chairman,  I will  support  your recommendation,  but withconsiderable  reluctance.  I think this is  another example  where immediate  disclosure of ourfear that the markets  will interpret  this  adjustment as  another in  a string  of easing actions  yet tocome.  I would hope  that along the  way in coming  weeks,  when the time seems  appropriate  andthe market  tone seems acceptable,  you could indicate  to the market  that it looks as  if our easingis finished for the time  being, whatever  is the right way to do that.  I think this is a  case wheredisclosure  would help the  Committee.I  am concerned  that  we are pouring  gasoline  rather than water onto this  economy.  Thefact that the growth  of money is  unexplained  is not a  great comfort to me.  It  would help if wecould explain  what is going on by pointing  to some  statistical  anomalies,  to some  institutionalchanges,  to money going  abroad, or to whatever,  but the fact is we  cannot come up with  anygood explanation.  I fear we  may be pouring  a great deal  of liquidity into an  economy  that isbound to be  slowing  anyway  for the  reasons that  I talked about earlier.  The economy  currently is11/17/98fully employed,  its growth  rate needs  to  be a  little slower, and therefore  I  am not  at all concernedabout the forecast  of slower growth.  If it comes true,  that  is going to  be very  good news.

Youmentioned the stock market, and that  gives me real pause.11/17/98However, like others, I  am not going to  dissent for several of the  reasons that theygave.  One,  the point  you made, is  that I do not see inflation  as  an immediate threat.  Secondly,  Iunderstand  the  international  circumstances  that we face;  I'm not sure this easing move is goingto make a whole  lot of difference  to those  circumstances,  but we will  see.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  David Lindsey, we  are still using  the old directive.  Dowe still want to use the  word "moderation"?

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  "Moderate"  instead of "some moderation"?

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  No, I would stick with  the language  we have been  using, "somemoderation."  That is the  staff forecast for coming  months.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Less immoderate?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  The directive  language  is:  "In  the implementation  of policy for theimmediate future,  the Committee  seeks  conditions in reserve  markets consistent with decreasingthe federal  funds rate  to an  average  of around  4-3/4 percent.  In the context of the Committee'slong-run  objectives for price stability  and sustainable economic  growth,  and giving careful11/17/98consideration  to economic,  financial,  and monetary developments,  a  slightly higher federal  fundsrate  or a  slightly  lower federal funds rate  would be  acceptable  in the intermeeting  period.  Thecontemplated reserve  conditions  are expected to be  consistent with  some moderation  in  growthin M2 and M3 over coming months."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Call the  roll.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I put together  some  words just in  case we needed apress release.  I tried to suggest that we have  gone as far as we are  going to go.  Let me just readit to you quickly.  "Although  conditions in financial  markets have  settled down  materially sincemid-October,  unusual  strains remain.  With the  75 basis point decline  in the federal  funds ratesince  September, financial  conditions can reasonably be expected to be consistent with fosteringsustained economic expansion  while keeping inflationary  pressures  subdued."  That is Fedlanguage  for symmetric.The next meeting  is on December  22.  The Federal Reserve  Board  should retire  to myoffice  and make  a decision  on the discount rate.  Afterward,  we will  go directly  to lunch.
