MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman, may  I just  ask one  question?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sure.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I'm sorry  I didn't  do  it  in  a timely fashion.There was  some  talk in Europe  that was  critical  of  the hedge  funds  ofbanks for  contributing  to  the  instability.  Do you  think that  worsenedthe  situation or had no effect?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There were  some days  on which the  criticism ofhedge funds  or  leveraged funds  or  derivatives worsened  the  impact.That impact wasn't  very long-lived, but  there were  a few days whencomments  by officials,  especially  the ones by unnamed officialsallegedly getting  tough on hedge  funds  or derivatives, werecounterproductive.  I wouldn't put  that  as  a dominant  effect  but atthe  margin it  was  a  factor.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, I'd  like to  call  on Joan Lovettnext.3/22/94

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  subject  is  the permanent enlargement  of  theMexican  swap  line.  I hope the background material  that was  circulatedto  you was reasonably comprehensive  and comprehensible and that,therefore, I can be brief.  As was  explained, there  are  two themes  tothis  discussion.  One  is  the Mexicans'  desire for  a substantial  andpermanent  enlargement  of  their current  swap  lines  with the FederalReserve  System and the United States Treasury;  those  lines  are  $700million and $300  million respectively.  The second  is  the UnitedStates  Treasury's desire not  only  to be  responsive to  the Mexicanrequest but also to  set up a consultative mechanism on macro policyissues among  the  three NAFTA countries, which makes  a certain  amountof  sense.Specifically, what  is  proposed to  be put  in place, which isnow thought would occur sometime  in  the  second half  of April, would bea consultative mechanism among the three NAFTA central banks  andfinance ministries  and an announced increase  in the  swap  lines.  Whatis  being  thought about  is  for  the United States  Treasury and theSystem to  increase  our combined lines  to  either $5 billion or $6billion,  though I think there  is  a preference  for  $6 billion.  The newswap  lines would be divided half and half between  the System and theTreasury.  Activation  of  those  lines,  of  course, would require  consentas  is  the case at  the moment.  And normally that  consent would have  tobe  linked to  our satisfaction with the  economic policies andreasonable agreements  on  repayment.  Indeed, it's  contemplated thatall  or  most  of any drawings would be collateralized.  It  iscontemplated  that  there would be a parallel,  though  somewhat  smaller,increase  in  the Bank of  Canada's  swap  line with  the Bank of Mexico,though the  size  has not been decided.  The thought  is  that  there wouldbe  some  staff meetings with the Mexicans and the  Canadians  over thenext month  that would refine this proposal and then we would come  backto  the  FOMC  for  action, probably by telegram.  No action  is  neededtoday, but it was  felt  that a discussion would be helpful.  As  youknow, Mexico has been the principal user  of  our swap network  over thepast  decade  or so.  The  size of  the  actual swap  drawings has  oftenbeen augmented by special  arrangements.  A change  in the swap line atthis point would clearly be linked to  NAFTA and to  the shift  inMexico, as  of  the  first  of April,  to  an autonomous  central bank.  Itis  not,  I should emphasize, linked  in any way to  the  recent pressureson  the peso.  I would be glad to  answer any questions.3/22/94

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I have two  questions, Ted.  First,  is  thisproposal contingent in any way  on Canada's moving?  Second, are  theseconditions,  for example  the  collateral and consultative apparatus,unique to  this  arrangement or  do  the  other swap agreements have thoseas well?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  On the  question about  Canada,  I think  it'srequired that  the  Canadians  come  in  at  some point.  They actually dohave a swap  line now.  Whether  they will  agree on  the  amount  that  theTreasury is  thinking about,  which is  C$1  billion to C$2  billion or  thesize  that  the Mexicans are thinking  of,  which I was  told is  C$3billion,  I think is  another matter.As  far as  the  conditions are  concerned, all  swap  lines  haveat  least implicitly a condition in terms  of  the Committee beingsatisfied that any drawing would be  supported by the  economic policiesof  the drawing  country.  So,  in  that sense  it's  the same,  and I'llcome back to  that  in  a minute.  As  for  the  collateral, normally wedon't have any language  to  that effect  in  the actual  swap  lineagreement.  The reason  for  that  in this  case  is  that  the Treasury hashad in  the past quite  elaborate conditions  in its  own swap  line  withMexico and in its  other arrangements  relating to  outstanding swaplines.  My suggestion,  or my  inclination anyhow, would be essentiallyto  leave our  swap  line  the way it  is,  except  to say that  the amount Xwould be  raised to Y.  We would rely on provisions  of  the  Treasury'sagreement  for these  conditions.  I think that's a cleaner way to  dothese  things.  So,  in principle  there could be,  as  there has been  inthe  past, activation  of  one line without activation of  the other.  Butwhen an  activation took place,  then one  could decide what  conditionswere warranted.  We have  over  the years--both with Mexico  and withother countries  in the more distant past--always wanted to make  surethat  if  a country was  going to  draw, we had some assurance  that  theywould be able  to repay us  from one  source or another.  But the  detailsof  the  conditions  specified in advance have varied depending on  thecircumstances.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  But I take it  these  conditions aresatisfactory to  the Mexican authorities?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I assume  so.  We haven't had a full  set  ofdiscussions,  so  I can't  say that with  certainty.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  First,  just a small  item of  clarification.  Inyour memorandum you say Canada's  line would be  increased to betweenC$1  billion and C$2  billion, but it  is  already C$2  billion so  Iassume--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  No,  Canada's  line with Mexico would be increasedfrom its  current C$250 million to between C$1  billion to  C$2  billion.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It  hasn't been proposed yet to  increase our  swapline with Canada.3/22/94

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Our own with Canada?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  With  regard to  Mexico,  I have very mixedfeelings.  On the  one  hand, I have  trouble with all  the  swap lines,their utilization,  and the  conditions.  I'm still  not  satisfied in myown mind as  to what  is  or  is  not  an  appropriate use of  swap lines  perse.  And  in  that  respect  there  is  no reason  to  treat Mexico as  asecond class  partner versus other countries;  they are  a very majortrading partner of  ours  and I assume  in  the  spirit of NAFTA there  is  asense of  bringing them into  the  big leagues.  Now, whether  they reallyought to  be  on the  same  level  with the Germans  and the  Japanese  I'mnot  so  sure.  On the  other hand, when I look at  the utilization of  ourswap  lines with Mexico  in  the past,  it's  a very troubling pattern.  Ittends  to occur  at  six-year  intervals,  including 1976,  1982,  and 1988--very questionable utilizations.  And now it's  1994  and I would predictthat if  we  do this,  the line  is  going to  get used and we  are going  tohave trouble  saying no.  It might  get used with a supplement even ifwe don't approve  a permanent increase and there  are going  to be somevery serious  questions  about  the appropriate  use  of  this  facility inthat kind of  political environment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I didn't have  a question, but  a comment  ifthat's appropriate now.  I have  a lot  of  sympathy with what Jerry justsaid.  I think Ted has presented a number  of plausible reasons  forenlarging this  swap.  I think  the memo  that he distributed was veryhelpful and  it  showed that  this  facility has been used constructivelyon  a number  of  occasions  in  the past.  The drawings generally havebeen paid back promptly and U.S.  taxpayers  have not  lost  anything.So,  from that kind  of perspective I think we can make  a case  forincreasing  the  line.But it  seems  to me that  there are a number of  broader  issueshere that Jerry has  alluded to  that  urgently need attention.  The  1951Treasury/Federal Reserve Accord  established the principle  that  the  Fedneeds  to be meaningfully independent within  the government in  order  toconduct our monetary policy effectively.  I think we  all know thatthat independence  is  indispensable  if  we are  going to be  able todischarge  our fundamental  responsibilities  successfully.  We also knowthat  this  independence is  granted only grudgingly and it's underconstant  scrutiny in  the Congress and elsewhere.  Consequently, Ithink we ought  to be very reluctant  to  take any action  that might haveeven the  appearance of  abusing this  independence  lest we  lose some  orall  of  it.Now, with all  of  this  in mind, enlarging  the  swap  line withMexico worries  me a great deal.  As  I understand  it,  the  line wasinitially established back  in  1967  to help deal with balance  ofpayments  issues and  specifically to help  support  the then-fixedexchange rate between  the peso and the dollar.  That  rationale nolonger exists;  in  fact,  the  materials that  Ted distributed make  itexplicit that  this  facility would not be used for  this purpose.  So,it  seems  clear  to me  that  any  loan to Mexico  in the currentcircumstances  in  essence would be a fiscal  action of  the U.S.government.  And fiscal  actions--expenditures of  the  government--are3/22/94supposed to be  authorized by Congress and Congress  is  supposed  toappropriate  the  funds.  So,  whatever the  general merits  may be ofmaking loans  to Mexico,  I don't  think we  should be  involved withoutexplicit Congressional  authorization, Mr. Chairman.  So,  I wouldoppose an increase  in the  swap line.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I'd also like  to make  a comment.  Ithink that one of  the  functions  of  the  Federal Reserve  is  to  seekmonetary stability  in  a broader framework  than  just  the Americaneconomy itself because  of  the obvious  interlinkages  of  world markets,as we have heard  this morning in  Peter's and Joan's presentations.  Ithink that has  a great deal  to  do with why we  created swap  lines  withthe major  trading partners  of the United States and countries  that  inthe past have been  a very important part  of  the world's  interlinkedfinancial system.  Mexico, because of  a very much better performanceover  the  last  twelve years,  has now reached a stage where its  economicperformance seems  to me  to  justify being included as  a major partnerof  the United States  and the  other participants  in  the world economy.It  also  is  a country, being on our  border, in which  serious  financialinstability would have  a very definite  possibility of  spreading acrossthe border and creating problems in  our own markets.  So to me  it  isappropriate to have  the  swap line  used in times  of market  instability,which may or may not be related to years  in which there  is  apresidential  election, as  long as we  are careful  that  it  is  not usedto prop up  the value of  the  Mexican peso when all  the  fundamentals  saythat  that would be  inappropriate.  I think it's very consistent withour general  responsibilities.  So,  I don't  share  the view  that  it  issomething  that  is  inconsistent with  the  role  of  the central  bank andtherefore would demand approved funding  from the  Congress.  I thinkit's  just as  much a part of  the responsibilities of  the  FederalReserve  as the  swap  line with Germany  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Well,  I must  admit  that  I can support  therecommendation.  What  concerns me most, however, is  its potential use,a concern related to  Jerry's.  I recall  the paragraph in  the Maronimemo referring  to  the  fact  that  in 1988  the swap  line was  used forwindow-dressing operations to  enhance the announcement of  thecountry's reserves  scheduled to be made  by the Director General  of  theBank of Mexico  on August  4 and the  President  of Mexico on  September  1.I think of  swap  lines as  being used to deal with disorderly markets.I think someone who wants to  could make  a case  that perhaps they werebeing used for political purposes.  The  kindest  light  one  could put onit  is  that  they were used to prevent  the  occurrence  of disorderlymuch  the authority  that bothers me;  it's  the potential  in my view formisuse of  the  Mexican swap.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Their argument  at  the  time obviously was  thatannouncing a drop  in their  reserves would cause problems on  thefinancial  markets  and that was  the  reason we went  along with theirrequest.3/22/94

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Hasn't  there been a tradition  to use  swaps  todeal with disorderly markets  or do  we also  use them  to preventdisorderly markets?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think they have been used for both purposes.At  times when we have been  involved, there have been so-called window-dressing operations.  There were  some in  the  1980s.  During the  1982period  they were driven by a slightly different  set of  considerationsthat had  to do with  domestic currency cover  concerns.  I think  it  isright  to  question--and I would put  it  the  other way around--whethercentral banks Ithink it's  fair  to  say, however, that  all  central banks  do this  thesedays  though they tend to use other mechanisms to window-dress  thereserves rather  than central  bank swap lines.  You  could argue thatthe  use of  central bank swap  lines, which ultimately becomes  public,seems much more  forthcoming than what manage their reserves  over  essentially the past 20  years when  theyhavehas  done  to

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  But  these Mexican swap  lines were used in  1976,1982,  and 1988  as well.  The political aspect  seems apparent.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  there have been occasions  on which theyhave been drawn other  than  in Mexican presidential  election years.But  it  is  true  that  those  last  three have been  election years.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I have to  admit some ambivalencetoward this.  I think that  to use the  swaps,  as  the memos  themselvesimply, to  influence exchange rate  levels is  risky business.  I doagree with Bill McDonough that  they can be used to  stabilize markets.My question is  about  the  size  of  the proposed increase.  From thematerial the  rationale  for the number that we  are  shooting toward now,the  $6 billion total,  wasn't  clear to me  other  than perhaps  that  theeconomies  are  larger.  This  is  a larger number but  it's notnecessarily the right number for  any particular reason.  Is  that  afair  interpretation?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That's a fair  interpretation.  The  $5 billionnumber was  a number that  in  fact  the Mexicans put  forward a year agowhen  they approached us  and they had done a rough back-of-the-envelopecalculation of  the  increase  in  swap  lines  since the  swap network wasfirst established.  One can come up with these numbers  for variouscountries  in a lot  of different ways but  it's  fair  to  say that  thelargest  increase  in our  trade  since  1967  has  been with Mexico, bothglobally and bilaterally.  That's where  the  $5 billion number camefrom;  the  $6 billion number  came  from the  fact  that  that  was  thenumber we contemplated providing last November  in  the  context of

[SECTION]

NAFTA.  So  that's  the  source of  those  two  figures.  Neither  is  basedon  fine  scientific  analysis.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  First Vice President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I have  a question and a comment.  Ted,  is  itaccurate to  say  that Mexico has been the only country since the  early'80s  to  actually draw on  the swap  lines?3/22/94

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So  the  conditions that  we  impose on Mexico  insome  sense  do not  involve treating them like a second-class  citizen;those are the  only conditions  that are  really operative  at  present  interms  of our  swap  lines.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well, we  went  the  same way in  the  past.  Themost recent other drawing was  in the  early  '80s by Sweden.  And weasked ourselves  the  same questions  at  that  time,  about how long  thedrawing was going to be  outstanding, what  the conditions were, and howthey would  contemplate repaying it.  So  in  that sense we  asked thesame questions  as  in the Mexican case.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I would generally agree  with PresidentMcDonough that  this  is  a legitimate  function  of  central  banks  ingeneral.  But  I would be concerned, to whatever extent we enter  intothis  swap agreement with Mexico, that we do  so  on  a businesslike basisfor us.  In  that  regard I'd be  a little  nervous about relying on  theTreasury's collateral.  I'm also bothered, as  other people have  been,by the history of  the  drawings  and the amount  of  money that  seems  togo  from one  source of  funds  to  another  source of  funds  to pay each ofthem back.  And I would be concerned if we didn't  take measures on ourown in  terms  of  this very substantial  expansion  of  the  line withMexico so  that  if  it were to  be drawn upon we would have  independentmeans of  securing our  own exposure.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  maybe  I have not been clear on this.  WhatI was suggesting, just  as  a matter  of  convenience, was not  that wewould rely on the  Treasury but  that  the  Treasury could put theconditions  in  their  swap  arrangement because  they have done  that  inthe past.  We  have not put such conditions  in our agreements  in thepast, whether  it's  the  $6 billion line  we have  with  the  Bundesbank orany of  the  other lines.  And when  it  came  time  for  a drawing, then wewould draw on those  conditions  rather than have the  lawyers specifyall  those  things in  advance and have to  rescramble  them when the  timecame  for  a drawing.  I was speaking  just  in  terms  of  convenience  fromour  side.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So you would contemplate  that  if  they everneeded--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They would have  to  come  and ask to  draw on  theswap  line and we would have  to approve  it.  And at  that  time we wouldsay,  "Well, yes, we will  approve it  as  long as we make  thesecollateral  arrangements."  That's what  I would contemplate  rather thanpre-specifying those conditions.  But we'll do  it  either way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I would support  the proposal.  I think I heardAl  Broaddus saying that  since  the  line wouldn't be used to peg theexchange rate then  it  is  likely to  be used for some  other purpose  thatwould be less  legitimate and outside  of our  scope.  However, acrawling peg is  a peg when you reach the  limit  of  the  crawling peg.And at  that point it  does  become an exchange  rate  stabilization tool.Also,  I would like  to  associate myself with Jerry Jordan'sintroductory comments where he pointed out  that  if we have problems3/22/94with swaps,  we  ought  to deal with that  as  a generic matter and notdeal  just  with the  case  of Mexico.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  What  are the  consequences of  not approving thisrequest?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I don't  know for certain;  that's  why we  arehaving this  discussion,  if  I may put  it  that  way.  If  the weight  ofopinion in  the Committee was against  going ahead with  this  request, Ithink we would inform the Mexicans  and the  Treasury in advance  so  thatthey didn't embarrass  us  and themselves--particularly  themselves--byannouncing  something  they couldn't deliver  on.I think  the consequences would be  that  the Treasury would goahead and enlarge  its  own arrangement, presumably substantially.Whether  they would go  all the way to  $6 billion and leave us  at  $700million, I don't know.  But  something  like  that might  happen.  Andthat would affect to  some extent,  I think,  our relations  both withMexico  and with the United  States Treasury at  this point.  But  itwouldn't  be the end of  the world.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Well,  there  are  these  two issues.  One  is  thewisdom of  swaps  in general  and how well  they've been used.  Then thereis  the  question of  whether Mexico  ought  to  be  treated differently.The $6 billion is  in  line with  trade  flows  and various  other economicways  of measuring these things.  So  really it's  the  second issue  ofwhether Mexico should be  treated differently;  I think we are notreally talking about  the wisdom of  the overall  swap  arrangementstoday.  So  then my specific  question is--and I don't  think you reallyanswered the  question, Ted--what  are  the  consequences of  treatingMexico  differently?  What are  the  consequences of  nonapproval?  I'mnot clear  in my  own mind what  those  consequences  are.  I don't  come  tothese discussions  on  intervention  and foreign  exchange markets  andswaps  with any ideological baggage.  I just  want  to  know what  thepractical  implications  are  of  our  actions or  lack of  action.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I'm sorry  I didn't answer  your question.  I'mnot  sure what you mean when you  say "treat Mexico differently."  Ifyou mean by turning down their  request, there have been a number ofcountries  over  the years whose requests,  either  to join  the  swapnetwork or to  enlarge  existing swap  lines have been turned down.  Sononapproval of  their request would not be unprecedented from thatstandpoint,  though in most  cases  the countries  that were  turned downwere discouraged before  they had gone very far  into  the process.  Butit would obviously have adverse  implications at  least  in  the shortterm  for our relations  with the  Bank of  Mexico--and I think  it  is  notirrelevant  in  that  regard that the  Bank is  now entering into  a newstatus--and also  would have some  adverse  implications  for ourparticipation with  the Treasury and the Canadian authorities on  themacroeconomic policy coordination process.  I can't  speak  for theTreasury, but my guess  is  that they would be  less  inclined to pursuethe  arrangements they are now contemplating  if  we were to  back down.We  do have  a long-standing relationship with Mexico and they havecalled upon us  in the  past for  assistance.  There have  been somedebates  about whether  it  has been appropriate, but  it's  fair  to  saythat  the  Federal  Reserve has  taken the  lead  in many cases  in helping3/22/94Mexico over  the past 20  years.  So, nonapproval would  really have  someimplications  for our relations  with that  country and that  centralbank.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  What  are  the  consequences of  something  less  than$6 billion?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It's  doable but  I'm not sure  it's worth arguingabout,  if  I may put  it  that way.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  All right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me just  add a point here.  WhenTreasury approached us,  we  toned them down a good deal;  we  set  up alot  of  road blocks  in periods  when they wanted to move.  And we havethat  capability of  restraining actions which I think  this Committee,myself  included,  feels uncomfortable with.  If  we decide  that we wantto disengage,  we will  lose whatever power in  that area we have toinfluence the  system, and  that has pluses  and minuses to  it.Obviously, we can't  acquiescence in  a system  that  is  inappropriate.But  there  is  an  interesting  tradeoff here, which I think we have  to beaware of, when one asks what  the  consequences are.  I think one  of  theconsequences  if  we pull  away from this  is  that  there will  be a set  ofpolicies in this  area  that  we would find less  agreeable.  It  would beworse  for the  country.  It  might be better  for the  Federal Reserve;that's a possibility.  But  I think we  have to  keep  that  in mind.  I'mnot  saying that  anytime  somebody comes  up with  one of  these proposalswe  should dive in.  I feel  increasingly uncomfortable because myinclinations,  frankly, are similar  to  much of what  I just  heard.  Butthere  is  a lot  riding on how this whole  thing comes  out.  If  we sayno,  there will be both pluses  and minuses  I might add.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  So  this  is  really the price of  admission  to  abigger  show?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's  a partial price, I would say.  Wehave never been  in a position with this  Treasury of  essentiallythwarting  something about  which they  feel  strongly.  BasicallySecretary Bentsen, I think,  feels  very strongly about  this;  he was  anardent  supporter  of  NAFTA.  It  is  his  belief  that American  interestsin the  international financial  arena rest to  a large  extent on ourextending  those interests  throughout Latin America and enhancingAmerica's  international  trade position through a NAFTA-type agreementin that part  of  the world.  This  is  part and parcel  of  that  operation.And in many ways  if  we pull  away, I think we  lose  a good deal  ofinfluence  in trying to  determine how that  all  comes  out.  There  is  alimit.  I'm not  saying we  should merely do  what the Treasury  saysbecause  in fact  if  we had done what  the  Treasury probably had in mindbefore we put our hands up,  I think we would have been  acquiescing ina very loose policy.  One  second, Bob  Parry is  first.

MR. PARRY.  I certainly would not  favor disengagement  and Idon't  have problems with the numbers  that  are being proposed.  Is  itfeasible  to have  an agreement  among the Treasury, Mexico, and us--andfor  that matter others with whom we have  swap arrangements--that  theswaps would be used to deal  with disorderly markets?  I would feelmuch more comfortable.3/22/94-10-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  let me make  two points.  This  Treasurycertainly agrees  that  we do  not want  to  get  engaged in using  the  swapline  to peg  the  exchange rate.  That's point number one.  Therefore,in  the circumstances,  we are dealing  essentially with pressures  on  theexchange rate, which as  President McTeer  explained, can exist  evenwith a crawling peg or  a floating exchange  rate.  We ourselves  drew onswap  lines  in the  late  1970s  when we were operating with  floatingexchange rates because we were  intervening.  Presumably  thediscussions,  including  the ongoing discussions  associated with theconsultative mechanism, are designed not  to  surprise ourselves,  so  tospeak, when  these things  come up.  On  the question of  window-dressingitself,  I think it  is  fair  to  say that  it's  a little difficult--particularly  for me  speaking as  an outsider--to bind all  futuremembers  of  the  FOMC.  But  I think it  would be perfectly appropriate,based upon  this discussion, to  convey to  the Mexicans  in  the  stafflevel talks  that we  are going to have  in  the next  few weeks  that  thereis  extreme reluctance  to use  the  swap  line  for window-dressingpurposes.  And, therefore, since  they have  to  come and  ask ourpermission  to begin with,  they should know in  advance  that  that's  aneven harder sell,  if  I may put  it  that way, than dealing with moregarden variety  disorderly markets.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That's helpful  to me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I guess  I'm somewhat  confused because  thecomments around  the table  seem to  address different parts of  thisissue.  Are we discussing  the merits of  swaps,  period?  Are wediscussing  the merits  of any swap  line with Mexico?  Are we  discussingjust a request  for an  increase  in the  swap  line with Mexico?  Or  arewe discussing the use  of  the  swap with Mexico?  Or all  of  the  above?It  sounds  like  all of  the above  to me.  But  it  seems to me  that  thisdiscussion may be  long overdue  if we  have a whole array of  thesearrangements  in place with various  countries,  so  perhaps we  should betrying to  delineate or define better what our  standards  are  forengaging in  swaps.  That's point number one.  And point number two  isthen insuring that any  swap arrangement meets  those  criteria.I certainly have great  trouble with the use of  the  swapeither  for  pegging exchange rates  or  for window-dressing purposes.  Ithink that's  inappropriate.  On the  other hand, it  seems to me thatMexico has, within  certain limits,  handled the previous drawings quiteresponsibly even  though there may be  some  question about  the  purposeof  one or  two of  them.  They handled them responsibly in  terms  oftheir meeting the  conditions of  the  swap,  if  I have  the  rightimpression.  So,  if we are  going to  focus  on the  use of  the  swap  line,accepting that  swaps  are appropriate  in certain cases,  then maybe whatwe need to do  is  to  define what  we regard as an acceptable use of  theswap.  We have heard all  the  things we  don't  think are  acceptable.What  is  an  acceptable  use of  the  swap  other  than  to  address disorderlystatement  of my confusion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  To  continue Governor  LaWare's trainof  thought,  it would appear  that  at  some  stage we may need a greater3/22/94-11-and deeper philosophical  discussion of  swaps.  But that  isn't  reallywhat we should be  talking about  today, it  seems  to me.  We  do haveswap  facilities.  Also, we  are  not discussing whether we  should have aswap  facility with Mexico;  we have  one.  So  the  only question beforeus  is  to  give the Board's  staff  advice on  how to  proceed in  thediscussions.  As  Ted pointed out in  his  opening remarks,  he's notasking for  a vote;  all  he's asking  for  is  some guidance.  I am verymuch in  sympathy with what  the  Chairman said about  the  role of  theFederal  Reserve among the American monetary authorities--the Treasuryand ourselves--that  it  is  important  for  us  to  continue to  have  thevery positive influence  that we have had.  And having participated  inthat responsibility myself,  I think we have used it  very wisely andconstructively both at  the  level  of  the  Chairman and the  governors  andTed and the New York Bank when  it  has been involved.  I think  it wouldbe very unfortunate  if  the Federal  Reserve were not  involved at  thisparticular time  given what  is  soon to be  an  important  event  in Mexicanhistory.  And that  is  that in  a country  in which  the  power of  thegovernment  is almost unmatched anywhere  in the world, they havestructural  reform which  it  seems  to me  that we  as  the central  bank ofthe United States  should be  supporting by responding to  a requestwhich  in any case  appears  to be  reasonable.As  for what purpose swaps  should be  used, again I'd  suggestthat we  look at  the  record of  the American monetary authorities, whichis  very tough-minded and very good.  Ted has been a kind  of permanentfeature  for many years  and anybody who  thinks he  has been a pussycatin these matters would be very confused.  Our experience with thepresent Treasury so  far  is  that  they seem  to  have a rather  serious,sensible  attitude  toward international  cooperation  on monetarymatters.  The difficulty with  saying swaps  can be  used for X,  Y, and Zis  that  nobody can define a disorderly market.  You know one  when yousee  one, but  they take  on various  forms.  I think our  conversation hasbeen very good in  reminding Ted of  the views of  the Committee, whichhe probably already knew and shared anyway.  It reminds  us  all  thatthe view of  the Committee, in my phraseology, is  that  the  swapfacilities  should be used wisely and well.  But  figuring out  exactlywhat that  means  is  best done  at  the moment  that a request  comes  in,which also  in my view supports  the Federal  Reserve's  traditionalposition that  instead of  putting a lot of  conditionality into theagreement we  should establish  the  conditionality and the wholefinancial  arrangements  in light  of what's  going on  at the  time  of  therequest.  Then we can be very tough-minded;  we  can be  very specificand demand what's appropriate  at  that  time, which is  very, verydifficult  to  anticipate in  advance.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry, quick question?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes, point of  clarification.  You are  quitecorrect that  it's  sometimes difficult  to  define what  is  a disorderlythe  judgment  on that  issue.  But  the  issue  is whether the  authoritiesshould attempt  to  prevent what might  turn  out  to  be a disorderly

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Sure.  Just  a very brief response:I think where honest people  could differ  is  if  we were moving towardwhat we were very  certain was  going to become  a disorderly market very3/22/94-12-quickly--for  example,  if  we and  the other  central bank involved knewthat  the reserves were really moving out.  Then we'd have  to  decidewhether use of  the  swap  line was  appropriate.  We wouldn't want  tofight  the market  and defend an  artificial exchange  rate.  But  we mightbe  inclined at  least  to  entertain a request  for a drawing  on  the swapfacility.  I'm not  sure  the answer  ought to  be  "yes."  It may verywell be  that  the answer  is  "no."

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I hope so.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  But  since disorderly markets  are sohard to  define,  to have  the combination  of,  say, Summers  and Trumanraise their hands  and say this  is  a disorderly market  and then wedebate whether  they  are  right  or not  is  not something  I think we wantto  get  into.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You know, this  is  a much more profoundissue  about  the  nature  of  the  Federal  Reserve System than  I think werealize.  It  really gets  to  the  issue  the Vice Chairman was  raisingearlier  as to what  type  of  institution we want  to  be.  And I sensedthis  whole philosophical  debate  in  the discussion we  have been in  theprocess  of going through dealing with the  issue of  supervision  andregulation and a consolidated bank regulatory system.  I think one canmake a very strong argument for  the  central bank as  a narrowinstitution  that basically maintains  strictly central bankingoperations.  In  that narrow sense,  it's  not obvious to  me  that wewould be  involved in  swaps  and it's not obvious  to me  that we would beinvolved in  currency intervention.  We would restrict  ourselvesstrictly to  domestic monetary policy--and this gets  to  this  otherissue--with an add-on of  other  functions  like supervision andregulation and the  like.What  this  question is  really all  about is  the  stance of  thecentral  bank  in a broader context,  in other words  a role  in which wedo  get  involved in  issues which are  in many aspects at  the Treasury'slead.  If  we want  to  influence  those or  want  to affect  them, it'sobvious  if we  try  to do  that,  as  we  indeed have been doing, that werun  into certain types  of  questions  about  the nature of  centralbanking per se.  I think the issues  that  are being raised here  arequite  legitimate.  They are not issues  that  relate directly to  thisnarrow question, however.  They really are  fundamental  to  the  natureof  what  type  of  central bank we wish to  be.  And there  are  strongarguments  on both  sides.  I have seen the  influence of  thisinstitution in  this Administration  and in previous ones  and I wouldhate  to  give  it  up.  I think we  are  a force  for good.  And if  weto  the  nation.  I fully recognize  the  concerns  that  have beenexpressed today, and I'm  as uncomfortable as  any of  you.  And unlikeEd Boehne,  I do  carry intellectual baggage  into  this discussion.  I'mafraid my views  are more  like  those of  Presidents  Jordan and Broaddusthan anything else, but I do  recognize that  there are  other  issuesinvolved.  Anyway, President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Well,  I was  simply going to  say that  goingforward we need to  keep  in mind that there  is  a tradeoff between thegood we  can do  with a somewhat broader function and  our  independence.I think we  always need to have  that  in  front  of us.  But  the  otherpoint  is  that  as  a Committee we  need to  take  a fundamental  look at3/22/94-13-some of  these basic philosophical  issues.  The problem I have with thecurrent proposal  is  that  it's  difficult  to  disentangle  the proposalfrom the broader  issues.  If we  do  this now, then it's  going to  besomewhat more  difficult  subsequently, at  an  early date,  to  look at  thebroader  issues because  the  current proposal  takes  us down  a particularpath.  That bothers me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  The questions  I had in mind have  been largelyanswered by your remarks  just now and by Bill's  remarks before,putting  this matter  into  a broader  context.  I think your remarks  areextremely  important.  The reason  is  that  the way we conduct  ourselvesthis year with regard to  this  issue and how that's viewed when it  getsscrutinized by others  could tell  us a lot about whether this  is  or  isnot  a desirable  thing to  do.  We need to know if  it  is  accepted onCapitol  Hill,  at  the  Treasury, and by others  subsequently.One  other comment  is  that  I'd be very careful about going  toofar with  the  linkage of  the  timing of  this  with other developments.  Ithink NAFTA was  a wonderful  development, as  I'm sure everybody elsedoes,  and what  the Mexicans  are going to  do  on April  1st  I think  isterrific.  But  I wouldn't want  to  link this  too closely  to  thatbecause  I don't know whether Costa Rica or  Chile or who will be  nextin  line or when.  But  to say  that  joining the  free trade  agreement andbroadening participation in  this  sort  of  thing means  that  as  soon  asthey make  the  central  bank independent  they can join  the  swap club isnot a message we want  out  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I am  in general very supportiveof your  comments,  and I have  the  exact concerns  that you and mycolleagues  have.  But two points  came up  in  this  discussion thattroubled me.  The  first  is  the use of  the phrase  "this Treasury."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Well,  if  I read this morning's  paper correctly,

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What did you see  in  the paper thismorning?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Apparently there was  some  talk  in  theWashington wire  or one  of  those columns  that he's going  to be  out but3/22/94-14-that Mr. Altman will not be  the  successor, Mr. Rubin will  be.  That'sjust part  of  it.  Is  that malicious gossip?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's U.S.  news.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That's  U.S. news.  It  has nothing to  do withthe  point except that  I want  to make certain that we  are clear  in  ourown minds that  we are not making a deal  with  "this Treasury,"  "thisSecretary of  the  Treasury,"  "this  Deputy Secretary of  the  Treasury,"or  "this anything."  So we  should not cloud our judgment because wewill be  in bed with other Treasuries  and other Secretaries  of  theTreasury as well.Parallel  to  that  is  the phrase that was  unmentioned and thatis  "this Mexican government,"  which is  very much  like  "this Treasury"except  that  it  is  much more volatile than  "this Treasury."  "ThisMexican government" may very well be  replaced and we  don't know whothe replacement  is  going to  be.our very warm and legitimate  feelings toward  "this  Treasury" and  "thisMexican government" we  ought  to  realize  that's not  who we  are reallysigning on with.So  before we  jump on board withThe  other question  I had--this  is  actually a question ratherthan a statement  or speech  or whatever--is how do we  say  "no"?  WhatI've  felt very reassured about  is  double  bullet  two on page 3 of  thememo and that  is  that drawings  on  the Federal Reserve  swap  line wouldcontinue to  require  the  agreement  of  the FOMC.  I assume,  therefore,that when these unstable market  conditions occur  the Chairman wouldcall  a conference call  and we would discuss  it  and vote on  it  asneeded.  Is  that  correct?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes,  although it  depends on the  circumstances;but  yes  in principle.  In  the past  that's how things have happened andI would expect no matter who  is  the Chairman that's  how things wouldbe done.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Well,  this  Chairman will be with us  a longtime.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We are not always perfect at  this, but  in  thepast efforts have been made by the  staff,  particularly  in  the  case  ofMexico because  the Mexican swap  line has been more  actively used thanthe  others,  to  keep the Committee  informed about developments  and totry  to  anticipate possible requests.  There have  been discussions  andconsultations with  the Committee when there have been approaches  tous.  Maybe  I shouldn't mention  it,  but  the  recently releasedtranscripts  included a conference  call  in October  of  1988  about aspecial  swap  arrangement which  in  the end never was  implemented, butthat was  discussed extensively by the Committee  at  that  time.  And Iwould presume that  that's  the way things would happen  in the  future.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Well,  I think  the real  question to  ask is  howhard do you think it  would be  under real  live  circumstances  for  us  tosay  "no"?  Say, for example,  we  are coming  up on  two weeks before theMexican election and there  is  a legitimate run on the  peso--a3/22/94-15-disorderly market because  it  looks as  if  someone  else  is  going  to winor whatever.  That  is  a real  live  case.  It's hard to  separate out  thepolitics  from  the  economics.  And if  we have  a disorderly market,could this  FOMC easily say  "no"?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  I think it  would be  difficult  to  say  "no"if  they  came to us,  as  they have  in  the past, and asked for a specialarrangement,  too.  Obviously, you would confront  a slightly differentsituation  if  they have  a $6 billion--in  our case  $3 billion--swap  linewith us;  it may be slightly more difficult  to  say "no" to  an actualdrawing than it would be  to  set up  some  special  arrangement.  But wecan  say  "no."  In 1982,  for  example, we  said  "no" repeatedly.  We weredealing with a set  of  circumstances which were quite different  fromwhat  one would hope  to  see  today or  in the near future.  But werepeatedly said  "no."  We did allow them  to have  a few window-dressingoperations, but  that was part  of a strategy that  set out  to  get themin  the position so  they would go  to  the  International Monetary Fundand they would change  their policies.and the  Chairman of  the  Committee would have to  make those  decisionsas  they came to  them.  In  some  sense, you'd have  to  make  thosepoint  that  President McTeer made basically.  Mexico  is  there,  and weare going  to have  to deal  with its  central bank and all  its problemsregardless, because we are neighbors  and have  to  share largely thesame  space.So  I think  the  Committee

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.  And I hope you havethe  last word because we  are running up  against time.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I have  just  a fairly narrow question.  This  sayswe are  considering a substantial  enlargement  of  the  Federal  Reserveand Treasury swap  lines  with Mexico.  We are  the central bank, theTreasury is  the  finance ministry, and Mexico  is  a country.  I see  inthe  footnote,  though,  that  the  swap  line is  with  the Bank  of Mexicoand with  the Mexicans.  Is  it  central bank to  central bank--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  In our  case it  is  central bank  to central bankand will  remain  that way.  In  the Treasury's  case,  currently  it  is  theTreasury using the  Federal  Reserve Bank of New York as  its  agent withboth  their  treasury and the central bank  of Mexico.  I assume  theywill continue  that practice, but that's  a question the Treasury has  toaddress.  But  as  far as we are  concerned, the only  issue that wouldcome back to  the  Committee would be whether  to  enlarge our  swap  linewith the Bank  of Mexico  from $700 million  to  X.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Along  the  lines  Larry was getting at,  I thinkit's reassuring  that we are  dealing with  the central  bank rather thanthe  government or  the  treasury.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for either gentleman?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I attended my first  meeting of  this  Committeetwo years  ago at  the March meeting.  Over  those  two years  I've  beentracking the migration of  the  staff  forecasts  on nominal and real  GDP,prices,  and so  on meeting to meeting.  And at my first meeting intime were for  lower inflation  than  is now forecast  for 1995.  Westarted getting  forecasts  of  inflation  for  1994  in August  of  1993  andthrough March of  1994  the  forecasts  for  1994 were below the currentforecasts  for  1995.  And now I look at  the forecast  that  we have  for1995  and this  trend of  inflation  in  the  out  years revising upwardworries  me.  If  it's  causal,  then maybe  I ought  to  leave  the Committeeand these  forecasts  will  go back down again!In  trying  to understand  this  and how you make assumptionsabout policy that go  into putting  together the  forecasts, Mike, you'vesaid in  the past  that  you try  to read what  the  Committee  is  saying  andthinking with regard to  its  objective,  in order  to try  and ascertain apolicy consistent with achieving  that  objective.  So  I went backthrough  last year's  Greenbooks to  review the  comments with regard toinflation, and what  caused me  to do  this was  something  that wasmissing  from this Greenbook.  Beginning in March of  1993  theGreenbook's  statements with  regard to  inflation were as  follows:  "weexpect  it  to  slow over the  forecast period;"  in May of  1993,"resumption of  disinflationary progress;"  in June,  "lead to  somefurther disinflation;"  in August,  "tempering inflation  expectationsand downward pressure on wages and price  inflation;"  in September,"disinflation trends reemerged;"  in November,  "further progressreducing core inflation;"  in December,  "progress toward pricestability;"  and in January of  1994,  "movement over time  toward pricestability."  None  of  that  type  of phrase appeared in  this  one.  Infact  this  one, very pointedly I thought,  shifted instead to  "holdingon a track consistent with containment  of  inflationary pressures."  Isthat  a deliberate,  very significant  shift, or maybe a new reading ofwhat this  Committee has  as  its  objectives?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well, as  I noted,  I think we have provided abaseline against which you can apply your own  objectives.  As  I said,if  you  accepted the structure  of  our  forecast but didn't  accept  theimplied result  for  inflation,  it would  logically lead you to  say thatthe monetary policy assumption made wasn't  sufficiently stringent.  Asto the  strategy we  applied, I think we could plausibly have  read theforecasts  that have  been made  and  the  statements  that  have beenenunciated by members  of  this Committee  as  suggesting  that we wouldhave given you something useful  if we had put  in,  in  terms  of  ouranalysis,  a tighter  monetary policy and therefore a somewhat  slowergrowth  and lower  inflation result over  the next  two years.  In  the3/22/94-17-present  circumstance,  I think we have put in a tightening of  monetarypolicy that  does  not seem grossly at  odds with  the  kinds  of  signals wepick up  from  statements  that  have been made and the degree ofaggressiveness with which you've moved at  this point.  We  have  givenyou an  alternative that  is  perhaps more  comparable  to  what manyoutside  forecasts  that you might  look at  embody at  this point in  termsof  the  increment  to  short rates.  That's a hard call  to make.  It'shard to  say what people  are  thinking  just  today.As  to  the changes  in our  forecasts  over  time,  I think whathappened basically is  that we made some  mistakes.  Sometimes we  mademistakes,  in a sense,  in our policy  assumptions;  the Committee didn'tdo what  we anticipated.  I would have to  admit,  too,  that we  have hadsome upside growth  surprises  over  time.  But perhaps  even moreimportant, at  certain junctures  we didn't anticipate  how muchunemployment would decline  for a given amount of  growth.  And what wefind ourselves  with today  is what we  think is  less  slack than we mighthave anticipated in those  earlier  forecasts  and less  downward pressureon the  inflation rate.  So  we  are not  anticipating, without very sharpconstraint on  aggregate demand,  that we'll get  to the  low 2 percentinflation range within  the next year or  so.  That was  perhaps  acomplicated answer, but you've raised a whole bunch  of  questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I'd like  to ask  a question about unemploymentthat  I don't  think  is  related to  that excellent memo  that  deals withsome of  the problems with the new series.  It  may be  a bit related  toyour answer  to  Jerry.  Looking  at the  unemployment rate and the  amountof  slack implied in  labor markets,  it  looks as  though you have  eithera new Okun's Law relationship relative to your previous  forecasts  orsome kind of  an  intercept  change that resulted from  observing wherethe  first  quarter's unemployment rate  is.  Real growth,  if  you comparethe  two  forecasts,  is  less  than  it  was in  the prior  forecast  and theunemployment rate  is  also a fair amount  less.  Is  that  just  anintercept  change or some  conclusion that  Okun's Law is  operating in  adifferent way?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think you've put your  finger on what  is  asignificant  question and,  if we had wrestled with  it  for a whilelonger, perhaps we might have  come to  a different  conclusion.  You'vehighlighted the  key point,  and that  is  that we  have  taken  seriouslyour view of what has  happened recently--I  mean the  drop inunemployment--not  seeing clear evidence that  it  is  just  a fluke.  Andwe essentially used this  as  a jumping off point in  this  Okun's Lawassessment.  If  one used a different  jumping off point  for  that  kindof  simulation,  it  is  arguable  that perhaps  the unemployment rate pathcould be  a couple of  tenths higher than what  we have.  But  this  isalways difficult.  It  goes back to the very problem  that  I mentionedin  responding to  President Jordan's question.  It  has proven verydifficult  in recent years  to  get  a fix on  that  Okun's Law relationshipand where we are  in terms  of  cyclical  or  trend behavior of  labor  forceparticipation in particular.  So I think there  is  a significant  areaof  uncertainty in this  whole  relationship.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  And when you do  that,  does  that  raise anyquestions  or  issues  about  one's view of  NAIRU?3/22/94-18-

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  No,  I think this  is  separable.  But  again, goinginto  this  deeply, one gets  into questions  of  labor market  structureand behavior.  It's  not  entirely separable  from  those  features  of  theeconomic  system  that relate  to how much pressure we get  on wages  andprices  at  given measured levels  of unemployment.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Well,  to  the  extent  that  the NAIRU doesn'tchange,  it  clearly has  significant  implications.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  all  things  equal,  if we  held to  ourassumption  of  the NAIRU of  6-1/2  percent  or  a shade  less  and we hadunemployment  at  6.8 percent,  and looked at  those numbers very, veryfinely,  that would be  enough slack, presumably, to  give us  some modestedging off  in the  inflation rate  over  the coming year or two.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mike,  I note  that  in  the  forecast  there  is  aroll-back  at  the  long  end of  about 1/2  percentage point, but  supposethat  doesn't happen.  How would that  change your  forecast?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  My life  is  flashing before me in  the transcriptsof  the  meetings that were  released recently where we  got  into extendeddiscussions  of  these sorts  of  hypothetical  cases.  It's  a fairquestion;  it  was back  then,  too.  [Laughter]  I think we made somesignificant mistakes in  our assessments  of  what  the term  structurewould do  a few years ago.  It  depends, obviously,  on what  circumstancegave  rise  to  that.  If  it  were  in  essence a decidedly greater  degreeof  risk aversion on  the part of  investors  who have been burnedrecently and are  demanding a much larger  term premium, all  otherthings  equal,  it  would make  capital more costly  to  firms  who wanted tobuy equipment  and so  on.  And I think  it  would tend  to  damp aggregateeconomic  activity relative  to  our  current projection.  If  it were  areflection of  underlying stronger  demands for  capital based on higherexpected returns,  then  I think  in  a sense  it  could be  the bond marketvigilantes  keeping things under some  control.  Whether  on net we wouldhave  a higher GDP  outcome or  not,  I don't know.  But  it  would be adifferent  situation.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Let's assume  the  first;  could you quantify itat  all?  How sensitive  is  the forecast--

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think 1/2  percentage point  at  the  long end,even perhaps modifying the  rather  strong  interest-sensitivities  in  ourmodel,  is non-negligible  in terms  of  economic  impact.  So  I think weare  talking about potentially a few tenths  on GDP over the next  year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions?  If not, whowould like  to  start  the  tour  de table?

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I'll jump  in  first, Mr. Chairman.  In  theAtlanta  District, economic  activity continues  to  look quite positive.Retail  sales,  for  example,  have  shown very good gains in both Februaryas well  as  in  early March.  Businesses are reporting  increased trafficand the  expectation is  that  the rest  of March will be  equally good.In  fact,  they are  reporting  their  expectation  that  the rest  of  the3/22/94-19-year will  continue to  be  good.  Home  furnishings and durable  goodssales  continue to be  strong year over year,  although they are notquite as  strong  as  they were  at  the  end of  last year.  But  even withthese  good sales,  businesses are  continuing to  keep  their inventoriesquite lean.  Tourism has picked up  in  the region with central Floridabeing  the beneficiary of  most  of  it,  although I would note  that wehave  had record  crowds  at Mardi Gras  this  year  in New Orleans  and thatconvention activity has been at  record  levels.  That's  boosting hoteloccupancy rates as  well  as  the  retail  sector.  And as  I've beenreporting for several months  now, District casino activity continuesto grow and the states  are  the beneficiaries  of  that  as  theirTreasuries  are  continuing to grow.Looking at  the production  area,  our manufacturers'  survey  forexpectations  for  six months  out were not  quite  as  optimistic  as  theyhad been.  It's  only marginally lower.  Pent-up demand for  new cars  isstimulating production for  automobile  suppliers, although  I have  toreport  that  the Saturn  factory near Nashville announced someproduction cutbacks.  But I think that's probably more related to  thatparticular line  of  car  than a reflection of  cutbacks  generally in  theautomobile  sector because, as  I've said, the demand  for new cars  iscertainly stimulating production.  Building products producers  saythat  they are beginning to reach capacity constraints because ofstrong residential  building.In real  estate, single-family sales  remain quite strong andinventories  are very, very tight in  many areas.  Building costscontinue  to  climb, as  both building materials prices and wages ofsubcontractors have increased, although most builders have been ableto pass  along most  of  these cost  increases.  In the Gulf of Mexico,the  rig  count  jumped  to  132  in  February;  that's  compared to 95  a yearago and 119  at  the  time of  the last  FOMC meeting.  That's  actually thehighest  level  in  almost  two years  and it's  almost  entirely associatedwith gas production.  Commercial  real  estate is  also  improving butgradually.  Absorption  and occupancy rates  are slowly rising.  And wefind  that  concessions  for  office space  are almost nonexistent  now inthe District.  New construction  is  fairly  limited to  retail  and build-to-suit  as well  as public  works activities.  In  the  financial  area,commercial loan demand  is  showing  some  signs of picking up, andresidential mortgage demand continues  to  fuel  the real  estate  lending.And it's not  just refinancing,  it's  actual  originations.Employment in  the  District continues  to  outpace  the nationalaverage.  Wage pressures continue  to be  evident only in construction,although we are  hearing some  reports  of pressures  beginning outside  ofthe construction area.  Manufacturers  are  reporting  some more pricepressures  for  raw materials, although they are not  expecting  thoseprice pressures  to  continue over  the next  six months.  The producersof  building products and  furniture continue  to  report  increasing rawmaterials and finished goods prices.  And lumber prices  remain quitevolatile, with cost-of-lumber  adjustments  now a common feature  of  newresidential  building contracts.  Retailers  didn't report  any pricepressures  from their suppliers  and none  of  the  contacts  that we  talkedto plan to  raise prices  in  the  near future.In conversations with business people  over  the last  four orfive weeks  together with reports  from our  directors,  I would say  that3/22/94-20-the  attitude is  quite positive and very bullish  throughout the  entireDistrict.  And those who are doing business  nationally andinternationally are  equally bullish about prospects not  only fordemand but  for inflation as well.As we  look at  the national  situation, our  forecast  for  realGDP  growth is  stronger than the  Greenbook's, although as we  getfurther  out  in  the forecast  horizon in  1995,  it begins  to  come  downcloser to  the Greenbook forecast.  The  reason for  the difference  isthat we  think the momentum that was generated in  the  fourth quarter,and perhaps  a little  in  this quarter, will  take  a little  longer toplay out  than the Greenbook assumes.  Our  forecast  for  inflation  is,in spite of  that higher growth,  a little  lower but  the  CPI in  ourforecast picks up  later  in the  forecast horizon.  I think  the  risks  toour  forecast are,  frankly, on  the down side and I tend to  look at  theGreenbook  forecast  as  representing sort of  a lower bound of where weought to  be.  So both in  terms  of  the District and the  nation,  I thinkwe are in  reasonably in  good shape.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  The  tenor of  the Third District's economy haschanged during  the last  several months.  Economic growth now resemblesthe  type of  growth  typical  of  an  expansion  rather  than the  lacklusterperformance  that we have been experiencing in  the mid-Atlantic  region.Manufacturing  is  clearly  strong in  the District, with much of  thestrength of  the  fourth quarter  carrying over into  the first  quarter,and expectations  seem very positive for  the  remainder of  the  year.New orders are  up;  steel and auto production schedules  are  strong.One major  railroader told me that his  company is  running  flat  out  andadding  locomotives and crews  as  fast as  possible.  And for the  firsttime  I heard from  a sheet  steel  maker that  they plan a significantincrease in  their  inventories  because  they are concerned about  thereliability of  deliveries.Residential  real  estate sales  remain  strong and industrialproperties  are  selling well.  Although commercial  real  estate  remainssoft  in Philadelphia,  it  has become very strong in the  suburbs,  with anoticeable  improvement  in  south Jersey.  I would say that strength  iscoming  on sooner than  most of  us had thought.  One of  the major realestate  firms  told me  that  they are hiring additional commercial  realestate agents  and not  all  that  long ago  they were  laying them off anddidn't expect  to be hiring them back for  some  time.  And there  issufficient demand to warrant new commercial  construction  in  thesuburbs  starting,  I would say, within  the next  year or  two.As  for retail  sales,  autos  and other big  ticket items  areselling well.  Where  there  is  still  a note of  caution is  with smallerretailers  and smaller  items.  They clearly have been hurt by weather.Their  feeling  is  that  their sales  will pick up, but  there  is  a naturalworry because  their expenses have been continuing and they haven'tbeen selling.  They feel  pretty good, but  they'll  feel  better when thecustomers  start  coming back in when  the  snow melts.Labor markets  clearly have  strengthened in  the District.  Isee more help wanted signs  in retail  stores  than  I've  seen for  awhile.  But  there  are  few, if  any, signs  of wage pressures developing.On  the price  side,  I have  not  seen any general price pressures3/22/94-21-although most business people  tell me  that  the demand  is  strengtheningto  the point now that  they think  there may be  some  opportunities  forprice  increases  in the  next  few months.  They always talk about  howlong  it  has  been since  they've had a price  increase  and their  optimismfor getting one  to  stick, I think, has  increased.  One can sort of  seeit  in their  eyes!As  far  as  the  national  economy goes,  there  are  alwaysuncertainties  in  these  kinds  of  forecasts.  There  have been very fewmeetings where somebody has  said, here  it  is,  the  economy is  eithergoing to  go  down or up  and there  isn't  any doubt about  it.  There arealways  risks.  I think our  job is  to  assess  those  risks.  My  sense  isthat  the  greater risk to  sustainable growth  is  too  much  strengthrather  than  too  little  demand.  I feel  that  way for  several  reasons.The  most  important  thing in  any economic expansion  is  not pinpointingthis  item or  that  item,  it's  the cumulative momentum that  carries usfrom one  quarter  to  the next.  And I think that momentum is very wellentrenched.  We also  have a highly stimulative monetary policy.  Mostof  the drags  to  demand  that we have been trying  to get  over  in recentyears  are  largely behind us.  And there  seems  to be  an attitudinalchange now which  looks  at  sales  and other  data as  a sign that  thingsare  going to  get better  rather  than worse.  I think that psychology isan  important part  of  this momentum.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Mr. Chairman,  in  terms  of  the  District, there  isno  question that the  underlying level  of  economic activity has beenand remains strong.  And despite  the miserable weather that  we havehad in the  Midwest most  sectors,  with the obvious  exception of  housingconstruction, have come  through very, very well.There  is  little  that  I can add to what you already know aboutthe automotive  sector.  The  second-quarter production  schedules havebeen set preliminarily  at  9 percent  over  last year.  This  increasewould be even greater except  that  some  of  the manufacturers aredealing with  capacity constraints  with  some  of  their better  sellingmodels.  Still,  the production  increase  in  the  second quarter will  beless  than  in  the  first quarter, as  Mike has pointed out.  Therefore,the automotive  industry's  contribution to  the  second-quarter GDP willbe  lower  than was  the  case  in  the  first  quarter.  The  capacity issuein  the automotive  industry,  though, is  an  interesting  shift  from anindustry that  for years  has been experiencing plant shutdowns  andlayoffs.  Now in  some cases,  they are struggling to  keep up withconsumer  demand, which of  course is  particularly the  case  for  lighttrucks.  To  address their problem Chrysler,  for example, has  announceda $1.8  billion capital  investment program.  And we  are  told that  it'svery likely that  this  program will  be  larger  as  they get  further  intoit.  Given what  Chrysler has been  through  over the  last  10  or  15years,  it  seems  almost  incredible  that  they are  now the industry'sstar  profit performer.  I must  say that  for the  auto  industry, all  theway through  from  the manufacturers  to  the  suppliers  to  the dealers,attitudes  at  this  point are really very positive.  The heavy truckbusiness has  only gotten better,  and Class  8 sales  estimates  for  1994have  been increased to  185,000  units.  The current  order  flow is  thehighest  that  they've had in  15  years and it's  potentially a recordyear for  some  of  the major manufacturers.3/22/94-22-The  steel  industry is  running  essentially flat  out  eventhough  the  current  capacity utilization number is  93  percent.  Thatnumber is  somewhat misleading;  several  companies  are  really producingat what  they  feel  is  their  capacity limit.  Some  of  the majorcustomers  of  the  steel  industry, and the  auto  companies  are a specificexample, have become  concerned about  the  ability  of  the industry tomeet  their  demand.  Ironically, steel  imports  this year will  increaseand likely  significantly, but  a large part of  the  increase will  comefrom the  domestic  companies  that will be purchasing  foreign  semi-finished products to  meet  domestic demand.  There  is  another  increasein  steel  prices coming this  summer.  Some while ago, U.S.  Steelannounced a 2 percent  increase that was  scheduled  for midyear.  Itkind of  hung  out there  for a while and others  didn't  join  it;  but nowit  looks  as  if  the  others will  support  that price increase.Retail  sales have remained on  the  strong side.  To  theamazement of  one  retailer I've  talked  to,  their  comparable store salesin February were 17  percent higher  than  last year, with good demandfor higher-priced items.  They also worry about  the ability of  theirsuppliers  to  deliver, and in  several  instances  the  suppliers  for  thisparticular  company are  adding  to their  capacity.Despite this  very strong  level  of  economic  activity I justdon't  sense  that  the  price pressures  are quite as  heavy as  I mighthave expected.  Major  companies, particularly those  that buy undercontract,  are  continuing to push their  suppliers  very hard and theyare  continuing  to  get  results  from this.  Labor contracts  continue  tobe very restrained, and wage  increases are  easily dealt with byproductivity  improvements, which continue to  be  very impressive.Having said that,  there clearly are  signs  that  in many cases priceshave  at  least  stabilized and that  some  are  showing slight upticks.That's particularly true,  of  course,  for  steel-related products.  Butwhile prices  in  the manufacturing sector may be  firming, theseincreases have been  offset by moderations in  the  service  sector.  So  Ithink, net,  our outlook  for inflation  continues  to be a constructiveone.With regard  to the national economy, our  forecast  is  verymuch in  line  with the  staff  forecast.  And I think at  this point therisks,  if  any, are as  Ed Boehne  has  just  suggested--namely  thatperhaps  the numbers will  come in higher  than our  current  expectation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  In  our District, we certainly have not seenany significant weakening  in business conditions  recently, aside  fromsome  temporary setbacks which seem clearly  to be  related to  theweather.  Business  is  basically good across  all  sectors and  I thinkit's  fair  to  say that most  of  the  people we have  contact with, ourdirectors  and others,  are reasonably optimistic  about  their prospectsfor the  remainder of  the year.  So  the  overall picture generally ispretty good and I won't belabor  that.In  contrast  to some  of the  other comments we have heard, Ithink the major, most  striking development  in our region has been theincreasing number of  reports  of rising prices and increased concernabout  inflation generally.  We  see  that  in our directors' meetings;  wehear  that  from  some  of  our other contacts.3/22/94-23-as  some of  you know,and consequently he  has contacta couple  of  weeks  ago, hewith a number  of  industries  that he  rents  to,  in addition  to  hisdirect contacts with the  construction industry.  He's  a well  informedand  I think generally perceptive  observer of  short-run economicdevelopments. emphasized the  fact  that  suppliers  that he has  contact with across abroad range of  industries  are indicating  that they  are  seeing priceincreases  in  a range of  3 to  5 percent  for a number  of  industrialsupplies and materials,  and moreover  that  these  price  increases  arenow, for  the  first  time  in this  cycle,  really sticking.  Some  otherdirectors  and some  of  our other business contacts  are  telling us  thatthey are  seeing increased prices  for steel,  plastics,  and corrugatedpaper, and  for  the  first  time  in  a long  time,  some  of  our directorsare  telling us  that they  are raising their own prices  in a broad rangeof  industries  from textiles  to  trucking.  So we  see  a little lessfavorable news  on  the  inflation  front  in  our region  than some  othershave noted.With respect  to  the national picture,  let me make  just  acouple of  comments about  the  staff  projections and analysis.  I havemainly  two points.  First,  I have  some  trouble with the  downwardrevision in projected real GDP.  Projected real GDP  growth for  thefirst half  has  been reduced in  this  Greenbook from an  annual rate  of3.5  percent  to  2.8  percent, and  for the  year as  a whole from  3 percentto  2.7  percent.  These  are  significant reductions.  I recognize  thatthese reductions  are predicated to  some  extent  on a now more rapidtightening in  policy than was  assumed  in  some  of  the earlierprojections.  But my feeling  is  that  we  are  still more  likely to  getsomething  like  3 percent  growth  for  the year  as a whole.  I wasespecially struck, Mike, by the projections  for consumer  spending,  forwhich  I think you have a projected growth rate  for the  first  quarterof  2-1/2  percent  and something  like  2-1/4 percent  for  the year as  awhole.  We just don't  see  that  happening.  If  I calculated correctly,even if  we don't get any change in  real  consumer spending  in Februaryand March, we would  still have  a rate of  growth  in the  first quarterof  3.6  percent  at an  annual  rate.Second, and probably more fundamentally, we have  someconcerns  about the  Greenbook's discussion of  the  recent behavior oflong-term interest  rates  and the  interpretation of  that  movement.Over the  last  five months,  the  30-year bond rate has  risen about 120basis points, with corresponding increases  in other  long rates.That's  one  of  the  largest movements  in  long  rates  in such a briefperiod since  the  end of  the  1981-82  recession.  In my view it stronglysuggests  that  inflation  expectations have risen by more than afinancial market participants,  as  evidenced by  their comments reportedin  the press  and in market  newsletters.  The Greenbook, in  somecontrast,  at  least  in  some  of  the  sections of  Part  I seems  to dismissor  at  least de-emphasize  this  inflation expectations  interpretation ofthe recent backup  in  long rates.  It  seems  to  offer two  alternativescenarios.  The  first  is  that  the rise  in rates  may reflect, at  leastin part, higher actual  and expected real  short-term rates  down theroad because  of  the  stronger  economy and the  reaction to  our actionback in early February.  But  over at  least the  last six weeks  or  sosince we  took that policy action,  some  long-  and intermediate-termrates  have risen  significantly more  than short  rates.  I guess  that3/22/94-24-would  imply on  this  explanation that  expected real  short  rates waydown the  road have  increased, and I just  think it's  unlikely that  theeconomic news  and policy developments  have  increased expected realshort rates 20  or  30  years out  in  the  future.  So  I don't  think  thatexplanation can account  for  a great  deal  of  the  significant  backup  inthe  longest  maturity rates.  The  second explanation, if  I understandit  correctly,  is  that  the  rise  in bond  rates may have  little to  dowith economic  fundamentals  such as  inflation  expectations and may haveresulted primarily instead  from what,  for  lack of  a better  term, I'dhave  to  refer  to  as  irrational market behavior--some kind of  bandwagoneffect with overshooting to  use the  term  I think you used.  That maywell  be  true;  I wouldn't deny that.  But it's  a hard argument to  getyour arms  around because  it's  really more  a psychological  argumentthan an  economic argument.  So  it  seems  risky to me, to put  it mildly,to  dismiss  or de-emphasize at  least  the  possibility that  the reasonfor  one of  the biggest backups  in long  rates  in  a long time  has  to dowith  inflation expectations  or some worsening  in  those expectations.In  any  event,  I think this  question  of how to  interpret  this  move inbond rates  is  one we need to  give  some weight  to when we get  to  ourpolicy discussion later  in  the meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Chairman Greenspan,  could I inject  a couple  ofpoints  of  clarification here?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sure.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  One,  for what  it's  worth, the  level  of  GDP  isabout the  same in  this  forecast  as  in the  last.  As  currentlyestimated, we got more  growth in  the  fourth quarter  than weanticipated and,  in essence, the  lower  growth rates simply  offset  thatsurprise.  The  second point is  one  of  arithmetic on consumption  in  thefirst quarter.  We don't  know what will  happen  in March;  we  don't  evenknow for  sure  what happened in  January and February at  this  point.But  in your calculation I think you were probably using the  currentlypublished estimates  of  real  PCE  for January.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The retail  sales  revisions  for January weredramatic,  and they would substantially  lower  the  number one  gets  doingthe same  February/March arithmetic.  So  that's  the key explanation forwhy we have as  seemingly low a number  as we have.  On the  interestrate  story,  I think you did touch upon the  various  elements  in  ourthinking, but you went  a step  further in  describing what has  happened,covering  things we didn't  say explicitly in  the Greenbook.  Youreferred to  the  120  basis point rise  in  long rates  since October.  Iguess basically we  find it  hard to believe  that  circumstances havechanged in  such a way as  to  raise  intermediate-  or long-term  inflationexpectations by anything approaching  120  basis points.  We  don't  findevidence in the  surveys of  that  kind of  movement;  we  don't  seeevidence  in  other asset prices  and so  on that  really suggests  that  biga move.  But we don't  rule  out  at all--I  suggested this  I think  in mycomments--the distinct likelihood  that  an  elevation of  inflationconcerns did play a role in  the recent backup of  rates, particularlysince early February.  Basically what we  said  is  that,  given ourexpectations about what kind of  news will be coming  forth over  thenext  several months,  there will be  some  allaying of  those concerns,3/22/94-25-and thus  a part of  the backing down  in rates  is  due to  some  reductionin  those  inflation expectations.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Well,  that's  fair.  The  point  I was  addressingparticularly in the  Greenbook as distinct  from what you said thismorning--I think  the  emphasis was  a little  different--is that  you hada statement  saying  "we are  inclined to  think that  the  emergence  of  alarge  inflation premium per  se  can  explain relatively little of  therecent  surprise  in bond yields."  That's what  struck me when I readthe Greenbook and  that's  really what  I was  addressing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  information we received about  theTwelfth District's  economy  since the  last meeting  suggests  that  theeconomy has  strengthened, although I would point  out that  California'seconomy continues  to  lag.  The  District outside  of  California isexperiencing very  strong growth.  District  employment growth outsideof  California was  4.1  percent between January  1993  and January 1994.Nevada, Utah, Idaho,  and Arizona  all  ranked in  the  top  five  states  inemployment  growth during the  last year, and strength in  these  statesis  widespread and  is  absent  only from  the mining  industry.Construction is very strong outside  of  California, with double-digitconstruction employment growth  in most  states.  Moreover,  strongpermits  and nonresidential awards  suggest that  activity will  continuein the  months ahead.California continues  to  show mixed signals.  Payrollemployment  declined again  in February.  Employment is  off about  1.2percent  in the past  year and since  July of  1990  it  is  down  644,000.But  it  appears  that  real  estate conditions  are  improving  somewhat.Residential  sales  in  California were up  20 percent  in  January  from thelevel  of a year ago, which could have something  to  do with weather.Contacts also  report more multiple offers  for  housing  in many parts ofthe state.  And the  commercial  real  estate picture  is  improving, withstabilizing rents  and  slight declines  in vacancy rates  reported.There  are a few prominent  forecasters  that  people  follow forCalifornia.  One  is  UCLA and the  other one  is  Salomon Brothers.  Bothof  them  recently have  revised upward their  forecasts  for  the  state,predicting  that  economic  recovery will begin in  the  second half  of  theyear primarily as  a result  of  the  improved picture with regard to realestate and also  the  infusion of  earthquake relief  funds.Turning  to  the national  economy, I agree with the  Greenbookforecast  as  far  as  GDP  is  concerned, with  it  averaging approximately2-1/2 percent  over  this year and next.  It's  worth emphasizing, ofcourse,  that  this  forecast  assumes  a rise  in short-term rates  fromcurrent  levels.  The  strong growth  that  we saw in  the  last half  of  theyear has all  but eliminated  the gap between actual  and potential  GDP,as mentioned by Mike  Prell,  and has brought  unemployment close  to mostestimates  of  the natural  rate.  The  further growth projected for thisyear would seem very  likely to  eliminate  any gap  that might remain.It  seems,  as  Ed Boehne  and others  said, that there  are fewdownside risks  to  this  forecast  and conceivably  there could be  someupside risks.  The Greenbook  and the financial  markets presume asignificant increase  in short-term interest  rates  this year but,  evenif  these  come about,  I wouldn't expect to  see  any further progress  in3/22/94-26-bringing  inflation down.  Therefore, my expectation  for  CPI  inflationover  the  forecast period  is  very similar  to  the Greenbook average  ofapproximately 3 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  First Vice  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Well,  I have  a somewhat  less bullish reportthan  the rest of  you.  But  it's also  a little  less bearish  than hasbeen  the usual  case  for  the First District.  Sizable  data revisionsand recent data  trends suggest  that  the New England economy is  doingbetter  than most  observers,  including  ourselves, recently thought.Upward  revisions  to  the payroll employment numbers  were substantialand now  show that  the region began a gradual recovery in  the summer of1992  or  about  a year earlier  than  the originally published data hadshown.  Services  are the most notable  source of  employment growth.Service  jobs  in the  region now exceed  their pre-recession peak byabout  6-1/2 percent.  Other  indicators--unemployment  rates,  helpwanted advertising, housing permits--are  consistent with  a gradualeconomic recovery in the  region.  After a very severe  recession, NewEngland's  recovery finally  seems  to  be  tracking  the nation's.  Nowdespite  the net  increase in  overall  employment,  large  employers  in anumber  of  industries  continue to  announce layoffs,  and manufacturingemployment continues  to decline.  The  shrinkage  in defense  spending ishurting  the region.  The  computer companies are  still  struggling.Interestingly, however,  the region  is  benefiting  somewhat from  thestrong performance of  the U.S.  auto makers  despite having no assemblyplants.  Companies  making various  rubber, metal,  and textile productshave  seen increased demand  from the  auto  industry.  Most manufacturershave ambitious  capital  spending plans,  but few if  any have plans  toresume hiring.Although a few First  District manufacturers report  scatteredincreases  in  input prices,  selling prices  are not  going up.Competition is  intense  in  almost every industry, so  there  is  noautomatic passthrough of  higher costs.  In  addition, companies  appearto  be using technology more intensively to  improve productivity.  Andthe products  they sell  also may be more durable  and last  for  longerperiods  before  replacement  is  needed than before.  One major dealer ofheavy trucks reported that  it  is  common now for  truck trade-ins  tooccur after 600,000  to  700,000 miles  owing to  improvements  intechnology and durability versus  trade-ins  at  about 250,000  to  300,000miles  less  than a decade ago.  Severe weather has  depressed retailsales  and construction in New England but manufacturers andmanufacturing hours were generally unaffected.On the national side, we  see  a deceleration  from the pace  inthe  latter part of  1993  similar  to  the Greenbook.  At  issue here  ishow much slack does  the  economy have before  it  reaches  a point whereinflationary pressures increase considerably and how fast will  it  moveto  that point.  As  the  staff  noted in  one  of  their briefing papers,reasonable people can differ  on  the  amount  of  labor market slack,  andat  the margin we do.  Our view is  that  the NAIRU  is  perhaps  25 basispoints  lower  than the  Board staff  estimate or  at  the  low end of  therange.  We also  see  the growth  rate  of  potential GDP as  slightlyhigher,  so we come  out with an  estimate of  a higher capacity forgrowth than  the Greenbook.  On the  issue of how fast  the economy willclose  the gap,  we have been impressed by the  amount  of  longer-endinterest  rate movement that  has  occurred since February and the3/22/94-27-constraining effect  that has.  On the  other hand, our  estimates  of  thefuture  drags  from  the external  sector are  less  than  those  of  theGreenbook and we  see  somewhat  stronger  consumer durable  goodsexpenditures  and  state and local  spending  and perhaps  higher  inventoryinvestment.  These  forecasts  of  slightly greater  speed are marginal,however, and we are  in complete  agreement with  the  Greenbookassessment  that  there  is  no  near-term threat of  rising inflation.

MR. STERN.  Our reports  on  the Ninth District have beenpositive for  a long period of  time now and nothing has  really changed.In  fact,  it  appears  that  there has been  a further step-up  in  activitypretty much across  the board both by region and by sector.  Attitudesare positive;  employment  has continued  to  increase;  expectations about1994  for  the most part  are positive,  and this  is  a continuation  ofwhat  has been going on  for  quite  some  time.  If  we are  looking  fornegatives,  one  thing  that has become more pronounced in recent monthsis  that the phenomenon  of Canadian  shoppers  coming across  the  borderto  spend their money has  diminished, in part because of  changes  in  theexchange  rate and  in part because  of  changes  in Canadian policies  thathave made  that more difficult  and more  expensive.  One  other factorthat  is  of  some  interest  relates  to housing activity.  We have hadbrisk sales  for  quite  some  time now and we  are  getting reports  fromrealtors  both in  the major  cities  and in  some of  the  smaller cities  aswell  that  the problem they  face  is  a lack of  supply of unsold homes.That  ought  to  augur well  for  construction going  forward.  So  the newsin the  District certainly remains positive and if  anything hasimproved even further.With regard to  the  national economy,  our model,  although  itsstructure  is  quite  a bit different  from the  one that  underpins  theGreenbook  forecast, produces a forecast that's  really quite  similar.My own view is  at  least  a little more  optimistic  about  the pace  ofreal  growth, which is  to  say that  I think we might do a little betterthan  those  two  forecasts.  But  I think  the more salient  features  ofthe  outlook have  to  do  with the  lack of  disinflation, the  lack offurther progress in bringing the  rate  of  inflation down both  in ourforecast  and  in the  Greenbook forecast,  given the monetary policyassumption.On  this question of  slack, we  have  done  some analysis of  thepast  several years  that  confirms my impression  that the  labor  force atleast  for  a time  in the  1980s  grew more  rapidly than might have beenexpected.  Participation rates  rose;  the rate  of  increase  inparticipation  rates appeared to  be above  trend at  least  for some  time.That's not  a situation  that  is,  of  course,  sustainable  forever,  so  itdoes not particularly  surprise me  that we  are  getting  slower growth  inparticipation  rates now.  And if  all  of  that  holds  together,  I thinkit  does  tell  us  something  about how much slack or  how much  capacity wecan expect  from  the  economy going  forward.  If  one wanted to be  alittle more optimistic  about  all  of  that,  one would  factor in  theinternational  situation because  it  does  appear that there  is  a gooddeal more slack elsewhere  in  the world, certainly in  the  otherindustrial  economies,  than  there  appears to  be here at  the moment.Despite  all  this and  despite  the  strength  in the regional  economy,while  there may be  a minor  increase  in reports of  greater wage  orprice pressures,  there  is  nothing very broadly based or very3/22/94-28-significant  there yet,  at  least  as  far  as  the anecdotal  informationthat we are picking up  is  concerned.  There may be a smattering of  itbut  there  is nothing  that  leads me  to  believe we have seen anysignificant change  in  that  arena at  this  stage.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Before  commenting on the  District,  I want  toreport  on the presentation  I heard yesterday on small  businesses.  Ithink most  of you know the National Federation of  Small  Businesses hasover  600,000  members.  I normally don't pay too much attention totheir  surveys, which  they do  once  a month, but  I was  struck by theextraordinary upward movement  in a number  of  indicators recently.Most  of  the  indicators  started to  turn  either  in July or by Octoberand they have moved quite sharply.  As  an indication of  the thinkingof  these  small businesses the  levels  are quite  impressive:  Plannedcapital  outlays  are  the highest  since  1989  and 1990;  job openings  arethe highest since  1989;  plans  to  hire  are  the highest since  1990;  andplans to  raise prices  are the  highest since  1991.  With regard  to  thegeneral  outlook for business  conditions,  the  response chosen was  thatnow is  as  good a time  as  any  since  early 1990.  I have no  idea  aboutthe  statistical  reliability of  that  survey, but  I thought  it  was  soupbeat across  the  board that  it  was notable.Turning  to  the District,  everything  there also  tends  to  beuniformly positive;  in  fact,  it would be  hard to  find something thatstands out  in our District  that  is  of  a negative nature.  What  isinteresting to me  is what  is  not there.  A year ago,  I was stillhearing, and  I think many of  you were  hearing, a lot  of  talk aboutanemic recovery,  sluggish pace, use of  the  term  "recovery" more  than"expansion,"  and worry about  its  sustainability.  That's  completelyabsent in the  commentary I'm hearing now.  The  talk  is  more about howmuch more up  side  there is.  There was  another question in  the  smallbusiness  survey about various  concerns  the  firms had:  taxes,regulations,  and  so  on.  A couple  of years  ago one of  the highestconcerns  was demand  for their  products, and  that has  pretty muchdropped out  of  what  is being reported now.  And that's  consistent withwhat  I'm hearing  in  the District.  In the  Greenbook, it  was said thatmotor vehicles production would add 1-1/2  percentage points  to  growthin  the  first quarter, but  that  that  stepped-up production istransitory and would be  fully reversed in  the  second quarter.  That'snot  what we are hearing in  our District.  The auto  companies  in  Ohioand our part  of Kentucky are  not  indicating in  their  reports  to usthat a drop-off  is  imminent.  Maybe that  has  something to  do withseasonality;  I don't know.On  the national  level,  I have the  same kinds  of  concerns  thatAl  Broaddus  expressed  about  the use of  higher real  interest rates bothin  the Greenbook  and in Mike's presentation.  To  say that we  arecounting on  higher real  interest rates  to  damp aggregate demand  andthen try to  talk  about what we mean by these higher  real  interestrates  just  doesn't  square with past  experience.  Normally, we wouldn'texpect in partial  analysis  a steeper yield curve to be  associated witha less  expansionary monetary policy.  In  fact,  the  contrary.  Wenormally would expect  that  as an  expansion matures,  the yield curvewould naturally flatten and very often invert  before we  get  to the  endof  the  expansion.  To say that we  have moved to  a much steeper yieldcurve recently and,  therefore,  policy is  more restrictive,  I think3/22/94-29-needs more  explanation.  If we  say  that  the run-up  in  interest  ratesis  too big  to be explained by an  upward revision of  inflationexpectations  over 10  years to  30  years, we  have a similar problem  ofsaying that  the  expected real  return  to  real  productive capital  overthe  next two  to  three  decades  has been revised up by  80  to  100  basispoints.  So what  we wind up with is  that we  are using the  term realrate  to  include things  other than real  rates  of  return to  realproductive capital,  mainly risk.  And we really ought  to make  threereal  rate  in  one sense,  and what  is  simply a risk premium  that may befostered by people's  concerns  about policies, political  developments,and whatever else.  And that's  a different way of  looking at  thingsthan you were  telling us.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  The  Second District  is mirroringwhat  Cathy Minehan  said about  the First District.  It  has begun toparticipate  in the  economic recovery,  led by very strong exports,especially to Canada,  and what you are  all very familiar with,  thestrong performance  of  the  financial  sector.  So wages  are  beginning tomove  up.  General  economic performance is  doing rather well  and thefeel  of  the District  is  considerably better.Regarding  the  national  scene,  our  forecast has  somewhathigher  growth  and somewhat, but  not very much, higher  inflation thanthe  Greenbook.  My main  concern,  to borrow a notion from Ed Boehne,  iswhether  there  is  anything  around that  could break  the momentum of  thisrecovery, and  therefore have even  the  Greenbook  forecast wind up beinga bit optimistic.  I think there are  two possibilities.  I certainlywould not  label them  as probabilities but  I think we need to  beattentive to  them.  There has  been considerable  concern  about whatwould happen if  all  the people who have moved from bank  deposits  intomutual  funds  of  various  types were to become  sufficiently nervous  thatthey started pulling  their money out  of  the  funds.  What would that  doto markets?  I think perhaps a more  likely event would be not  thatthey would pull  their  money out of  markets but  that as  they got  theirreports  on what really happened to  them  in  February and  so  far  inaware  that  they are not as  well  off as  they  thought  they were andtherefore  they would become  less  likely to  spend.  We  could have adiminution in  consumption as  a result.The  other possibility, and I certainly do not wish to  bealarmist,  is  a major problem  in the  financial markets.  I think wewere  quite fortunate  in  that the  financial markets, which were very,very rocky in  the first  days  of  March, settled down  rather quickly.But we were working  the phones  at  least  as  actively with the  moneycenter banks  in New York and with  the central banks of  Europe--specifically including  the  Bank of  England, the  Banque de  France, andthe  Bundesbank--as we  ever have  in earlier better known episodes  offinancial problems.  An indication of  what  was going on  is  that  rumorsbegan  to  spread very rapidly in  London on  the Wednesday of  that week,the  1st  of March, about possible very large  losses  at  two money centerbanks, J  P Morgan and Bankers Trust.  As  a result,  on  the New YorkStock Exchange that morning neither  stock could be  opened.  EventuallyMorgan could be  opened.  In  the  case  of  Bankers  Trust,  the  chairmanhad to make a public statement  that his  corporation was  profitable for3/22/94-30-the  year  to  date.  I remind you  that  this  is  a bank that  has a AArating and had a 26  percent  return on  equity  in  1993.  It  may be thatthe  good news  is  that  the rumors were  about  two  banks  that  are perhapsmost skilled at  funding  themselves and therefore  can handle adversitywith unusual  ability.  But  these kinds  of  rumors were  there.  Andlet's  remind ourselves  that  in  our ongoing concern about derivativesand the lack  of  transparency that  goes with  them,  the  thing we havebeen most concerned  about  is  exactly  that--that we  could have a rumor,well  founded or  ill  founded, about a major market  participant and  thatit  would spiral  into a liquidity problem.  That danger was  there.  Itwas  resolved and resolved with almost no publicity, which  is  the bestof all  worlds.  But  certainly if  we have more market  turbulence andthis  kind of  thing is  repeated and  is  not  resolved quite  so quickly orquite  so  quietly, it  could be  enough  to  shake people's  confidence  tothe  point that  spending would be  less,  capital  investment would beless,  and we would have a lower track for  the  economy.My own conclusion is  that  even  though one  always  operateswith some  degree of  concern about  where  the economy really  is  going,  Ipersonally have much greater uncertainty about whether the  economywill perform  about in  line with the Greenbook  forecast;  yes,  it couldbe a bit  stronger but  it  is  not  at  all  impossible  that  it  could besomewhat weaker.  And,  therefore,  in my own notions  of what  that  tellsme about policy, it  is  that a certain amount of  caution  should emanatefrom the  uncertainty.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  The national  economy, as we  all  know, has  beenexpanding rapidly and that's  a phenomenon we would expect  to  seecontinue on a path above  that  shown  in  the Greenbook.  For  example,industrial  production over the  last  three months  ending  in  Februarygrew at  an  8.4 percent  annual  rate;  payroll  employment grew at a 1.6percent  rate  from November to  February which was  in  line  with thegrowth over  the previous nine months;  and  the unemployment  rate,adjusted for  changes  in measurement,  seems  to have  declined in anamount about  equal  to  1 percentage point  over  the  last year.In  the  Eighth District, we would expect economic performancein  the  first  quarter  to be  affected somewhat  adversely by unusualwinter  storms,  especially in the  southern and eastern parts  of  theDistrict.  But, nonetheless,  District activity and employment  havegrown faster  than  in  the nation as  a whole over  the past year andespecially in  the most  recent three-month period for which we  havedata--ending  in January.  So,  obviously, the  full  effects  of  thosestorms wouldn't be reflected in  that data yet.  Employment  reportsrecently have been dominated by expansion  in industries  as  diverse asappliances,  finance, poultry processing, trucking,  bicycles, andautos.  Particularly noteworthy are double-digit  annual rates  ofgrowth in employment  during the most recent  three months;  this wouldbe  in  the  electrical  and transportation  equipment  industries  and inconstruction.  Recent announcements  that  Chrysler will  reopen an  oldplant  in  the  St.  Louis  area and that Ford will  expand  its  productionline  also  in St.  Louis,  along with the previously announced 1995 plantreopening by GM, indicate  a dramatic resurgence  in  investment andemployment in  the  transportation sector  over  the next  few years.3/22/94-31-The  continuing strong performance  of  the  District and of  thenational economy  as well  reinforce  my concerns about  the  inflationoutlook.  Over  the past  five months both consumer  and producer priceshave  accelerated from  their pace over  the previous  five months.Producer prices  for  finished goods,  for  example, increased  at  a 1.6percent annual  rate  since September  1993  following a 2.7  percent  rateof decrease over the previous  five months.  Consumer pricesaccelerated from a 1.8  percent  to  a 2.7  percent rate  over  the sameperiod.  In  addition, and that's why I mentioned  industrial productionand  employment trends  earlier,  I think the potential  for bottlenecksand price pressures  is  growing.  Capacity utilization has  reached thelevel  recorded at  the previous  cyclical peak in July 1990,  and laborrapidly approaching the  degree of  tightness  that  existed at  that  timeas well.Not  surprisingly, I think inflationary expectations have  alsoincreased,  as  reflected in the  25  basis point upward shift  in  theyield  curve following our  last  meeting.  This  was on  top  of a 50  basispoint  steepening that  had already occurred between October, when longrates  touched their lows,  and our February meeting.  One  final note  onthis  score would be the question:  Is  a significant  increase  ininflationary expectations plausible when price  levels were decliningas  recently as  last year?  And my answer would be,  "you bet."  If  youlook  at the postwar period, there  essentially have been nine periodsof  declining inflation.  And in  the  four quarters  following  those  nineperiods, the  average  increase  in inflation rates  over  those four-quarter  periods was  2.2  percentage points.  So  it's not  at  allimplausible,  given what's  going on now, that  there are  significantlyhigher  expectations with respect to  inflation.

MR. MCTEER.  Eleventh District  employment growth has beengreater  than  the national average  for  some time,  but so  far  this yearit  has  been below the national  average.  I suspect  that  that's becausemuch of  the  country is  recovering  from recession while the EleventhDistrict  is  just  recovering from  sluggish growth.  On the  other hand,hours worked in manufacturing in  the  District continue  to  be at  recordlevels;  the weekly figure  is  43.2  right  now.  In addition to  a weakerrubber band effect  in  the  Eleventh District,  low energy prices  and theabsence  of  a major automobile manufacturing sector probably havesomething to  do with our relative weakness.  We apparently don'tbenefit  from manufacturing  of  automobiles and we don't have a partsindustry like the  Boston District  does.The actual pickup  in major economic  activity from NAFTA stillseems  to  be  in  the  future, although there  is  a lot  of activity goingon with companies positioning themselves  to  do more  trade and newentrepreneurial  start-ups  trying to  figure out how to  trade.  There  issome  confusion on  just  how to  do  it  and some  lag  in  the  ability ofpublic  authorities  to  teach people  about  the proper paperwork and  soforth.  All  indications  are that NAFTA trade  is  going to be a very bigdeal  soon.  You probably heard that Dallas was  chosen as  the LaborSecretariat  location  for NAFTA, a good  right-to-work state gettingthat honor.3/22/94-32-Construction of homes  has been  fairly strong  in  the District,creating some  shortages  of  building materials, particularly bricks  butalso glass  and other materials,  and some  shortages  of  skilledconstruction workers;  we have reports  of  some  upward pressure onbuilding materials prices  and on blue  collar wages relative  to whitecollar wages.  As  for news  from board meetings,  I guess  the mostsignificant news  I'll  admit  is  that  the Houston Board, whichperennially is  our most negative board in  terms of  its  assessment  oflocal  economic  activity, reportedly had a very upbeat board meetinglast week.  They are  talking about  a lot  of new strengths  in  theHouston economy, which has been the weakest major metropolitan area inthe  District.  Loan  demand has picked up  considerably and the  largerbanks  are reportedly seeking  loans very aggressively.  A  couple  ofweeks ago we had a meeting of  our Advisory Council  on Small  Businessand Agriculture  and--used to  report that  when he  tried to  get  a loan  from abank it was not  "no,"  it  was  "hell no."  He now reports  that  it's  not"yes,"  it's  "hell yes." [Laughter]  If  you're looking  for potentialweaknesses in  the economy, I would just  offer the possibility that  alot  of people refinanced  their house in  1992  and 1993  and when incometax  time  comes there  may be some  negative surprises  for them  in  thenext month.With respect  to  the  national economy, I have no comment  onthe  Greenbook except  that  it  contains more  "blue" than  usual.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  To begin with ourDistrict,  I will  tell you that  it's  growing at  a strong pace now.Recent employment numbers  show a growth  rate  for  the District  as  awhole  above 3 percent.  This  is  showing up  in manufacturing not onlyof  nondurables, which I've reported on before, but of  durables aswell,  reflecting our  auto  industry and our  aircraft industry, whichfor  our region has  shown some  expansion.  Construction in  the  regiongenerally  is very strong.  I spoke within  the Kansas  City region just  last week, andhe  indicated that  the activity prospectively for  the next  90  days  isas high as  he's  ever seen  it,  higher  than the  1985-1986  period.  As  aresult  of  that,  they are seeing  some  strains  in  terms  of  gettingaccess  to  labor, but not  necessarily in wages yet,  and also  inmaterials.Agriculture is  stable;  there  is  a tradeoff between  someincreases  in price  in  the grain side  which is  in effect hurting  thecattle side  to  some  degree.  Energy in  our District  is  still modest,with oil  being a negative but  natural gas being a positive, and  therehas  been  some drilling activity as  a result of  that.  Banksfinancially are  strong and are  also  seeing  an increase  in  demand forloans.  And their  attitude toward making  loans  I would say is verypositive.  Just  to  talk a little bit  about prices  in  the region, weare not  seeing systematic  increases yet  in  the data.  Land prices areincreasing but  at  a rate only slightly above  the  inflation  rate  in thelast survey that we  did, and  the same  is  true  in  some of  the laborinformation that  some price pressures are beginning to  emerge.  Thesame are  seeing materials prices move up  sharply.  He  quoted a figure asthat  I talked to  said that  they3/22/94-33-high  as  15  percent  in  some of  the materials  that  they were biddingfor.  In  land prices,  I've  reported at  other meetings that  in  therural  areas  of  Nebraska, Kansas,  and Wyoming we have  seen  land pricesmove up.  In  some  cases, we have  seen them  rise  sharply and theimpetus is  not  from outside  buyers but  from neighboring operationstrying to  expand.  So we  are beginning  to  see  that.On the national  level,  we continue  to view the  outlook as  wedid at  the last meeting in  that we see  inflationary pressures  that areincreasing more rapidly than  shown in  the  Greenbook--not by a lot butI think by enough to matter.  We see  that widening as we  go  out  into1995.  There  are three reasons  for  that  in  our  judgment.  Number  one,generally we  expect growth  in GDP  to be  above that  in  the  Greenbook.Secondly, we  see  the unemployment rate  coming  down more  than theGreenbook;  the  difference is  small but  combined with  faster GDP growthit's  important.  And finally,  as you  know, we view the natural rate  ofunemployment as  being somewhat higher  than  the Greenbook.  So  thecombination  of  all  those  factors,  in  our minds,  adds  up prospectivelyto  the  emergence  of  significant  inflationary pressures.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  As was  said early on,our  job here, of  course, is  to assess  risks.  And I think most of  whatwe have  heard today has  been centered around the risks  that we  see  inthe upside direction.  I certainly can't  disagree  that  that  isprobably the most  likely  scenario, but  I would like  to  inject  a couplemore notes of  caution into  that  if  I may.  I don't  disagree  that theserisks  are probably the most  compelling argument.  But  I do think thereare good reasons not to  assume overly  confidently that  that's  the  onlyscenario.  I think  there  is  a probability that's  considerably abovezero  that we may be a good deal  further  away from this  fullutilization  flash point than we  think we are.First of  all,  the Greenbook  forecast points  to a considerableslowing  in the  real  economy.  It  describes  the  consumer as neutralgoing  forward from here.  I'm not  sure what  that means,  but I agreewith it.  [Laughter]  I have  spoken before about  the  very heavy debtload  that consumers  have;  as  of now it's  all  still  there.  And as  BillMcDonough mentioned a few minutes  ago, we may have some nasty shocksin  the wealth effect  area that people are  about to  find out  about.Indeed, going  forward  from here, I think almost  all  of  the majorsectors are projected to  slow.  After  this quarter, unemploymentceases  to go down  in the  Greenbook projection  and capacity utilizationstops going up.  I find it  hard to  ascribe very much of  that  in 1994to  the  effects of  a slowly rising  federal  funds  rate,  though  there maybe  some effect  at  the margin.  Now, more  slowing  is  projected for1995,  and  I can associate  that  a bit more with a rising  funds  rate.In short,  that projection just  doesn't look  anything like  a runawayboom to me.The  foreign  economies, particularly  the  G-7  countries, have  avery slow recovery under way, if  indeed  it  is under way.  And theprojection is  that  their under-utilization  gap never does  close at  allover  the  forecast period, and their  inflation  stays  low and indeedgets  lower  as  time goes on.  This  tells  me  that  our net exports aregoing to  be a continued heavy drag;  there  is  going to be  continuedheavy pressure for  other economies  to  export  to  the  United States  at3/22/94-34-very attractive prices,  and I think  that  implies  a rather strongpricing  discipline on our own domestic producers.  I'm not  sure  theInternational  Finance  staff here would agree with that;  I think theybelieve  that  effect  is  more limited, and historically I'm sure thatthey are correct.  But  in the  foreseeable  future,  I think  foreigncompetition will  continue  to have a strong disciplinary effect  onprices  in  the United States.In  the  area of productivity  and unit  labor costs,  we haverecently been seeing a rate  of  growth  in unit  labor costs  that  hasbeen substantially below the  inflation rate.  In  1993  it was  .9percent.  The  Greenbook projects  that  to jump  a lot  next year  to 2.9percent, which would be very adverse  if  it  happened.  But  even if  itdoes happen  to  that extent,  I still  don't  see 2.9  percent  as being aninflationary  flash point.  But  is  it  going to happen?  The reasongiven for that  very adverse development  is  that productivity has  beenrunning much better  than  trend, and  it's  got  to  get weaker  in order  tocome back to  trend.  That  just might be  a tad academic.  It may bethat  the  folks  out there  in  the real  world who are  fighting to make aliving may not realize  that  they've been performing way above  trend;they may feel  they have  to keep  it  up in  order to  survive.  [Laughter]My impression is  that  they are  doing that.  So  it's possible  that wewill  continue to  see a substantial  improvement  in productivity thatInterest rates  cut both ways.  On  the  one hand, I wouldcertainly agree that  real  rates are  low and  stimulative, and that's  avery important  point.  But  on the  other hand, this  70  to  100,  maybe120  basis point  increase  in  long rates  that we have  seen, however youwant  to  measure it,  is  a powerful restraint.  We can  talk all  dayabout whether they are real  increases  or not  real  increases  and towhat  extent one way or  the  other.  But the  fact  of  the matter  is  thatit's  a large  increase and it  points  to very substantial restraintright now.  The  Greenbook projects that  long rates are going  to comeback down  in association with a rise  in  the  short rates;  that'shappened before and conditions may exist today where  it  will happenagain.  But  it's hardly a cinch bet.  That  could be  an importantconstraint.Finally, there  is  the matter of  inflation  trends  themselves;they are  still  improving.  Three years  into an  expansion, the  12-monthchange  in the  core CPI  last month, the  latest  figure, was  the best wehave had in  a long  time.  I realize, of  course,  that when we talkabout  trends we're  looking backward and we need  to  look forward.  Onereason  that  these  trends  have been looking  so  good in the  face  of  anexpansion has  been  the fact  that we have had a weak recovery, but  thenone reason  the recovery has  been weak is  because there was a weakrecession before  it;  we  started out  at  pretty good  levels.  Trendschange slowly most of  the  time.  The  first  thing they've  got  to do  isto  stop moving in the direction they are  already moving,  and in  thiscase  they haven't yet.  Then later  they may reverse.  Certainly, thereis  evidence that  that's  going to begin  to  happen.  The  last  time wemet  I used the phrase  "there is  dust on  the horizon."  Certainly, someprices  are rising;  there  is  no  doubt about  it.  Maybe  this  trend willreverse  faster  than  trends usually do, but  I don't think it  iscompletely insignificant  that  so  far  that  is  just not  happening.  Thetrends  are  still  in  the  direction of  slowly declining  inflation.  Overthe  previous 12  months,  the  PPI  change was almost flat.  The core CPI3/22/94-35-last month, as  I mentioned, was  the  lowest  it  has been in  a long time,at  2.8  percent  and on  a downward trend  so  far.Is  there  danger  that we are  going to  get behind the  curve oralternatively, if we  do move  now, that we  could conceivably choke offthe  expansion?  I seriously doubt both of  those.  But  I do  think it'spossible  that we have  a situation here where  the  economy, at  least  fora while, is  behaving in  some new ways.  It  could be  that  if  we  are notbeing pushed hard right now to  move--if we are not  in danger  ofgetting behind  the  curve--that  it  might be worth keeping  our powderdry for  a little while to  see how some  of  this plays  out.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  That's  a nice  sequence  and I'd like  to  associatemyself with a lot  of  what Governor Kelley just  said.  I want  to add tothat my perplexity about  the projected relationships  between  fourelements of  the  forecast.  The  first  is  the  presumed direction ofpolicy and the trajectory  of  interest  rates associated with  thatpolicy.  The second element  is  GDP  in  the  context  of  that policy  andin  the context of  what we presume  to  be potential  for  the  economy.  Inits  effort  to  tie  all  of  that  into  the  projection for  the  CPI,  thestaff has  come up with a projection for the  balance of  1994  and wellinto  1995  that has  the CPI  running at a higher  rate  than  it  did in1993  and 1992  and  the  GDP running at  a lower growth  rate  than in  1993and 1992--in fact  tracking very close  to what we presume  to be thepotential  for the  economy.  Those  things  don't make much sense  to me.Either  the  staff has  underestimated GDP  and it  is  going  to  come outhigher  than projected and therefore  the  CPI  numbers  are morereasonable,  or it  has  underprojected the  CPI.  If  it  is  the  former,then the  question that  I would raise  is  whether we  have the  rightmonetary policy.  If  in  fact we  are projecting a monetary policyinvolving rates  that  are rising  gradually to  a certain  level  with theresult  that  the economy is  growing at  a relatively sluggish rate andthere  is  no projected progress against  inflation, then clearly, giventhe  stated objective  of  stable prices,  do we have  the  right policy?  Idon't have  the answer  to  that  at  the  moment,  but  in  the context ofsome  of  the things  that Governor Kelley was  saying,  I just don't feelcomfortable with  the  conclusions  that  one  seems  to be  forced  to drawfrom those projections.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  There  has been a lot  of  discussionabout where we  are  right now with respect  to  the  real  economy.  Itdoes  appear, no matter how we measure  things  and how January andAnd as part  of  that  strength, we  are seeing  strong productivityimprovement, which really bodes very well  for  strength in  housing andin household spending.  Certainly, the  labor markets are a bitdifficult  to  read right  now given the  changes in  the  survey method.But  even with  that difficulty, it  does  appear that  there  is  someimprovement  in  the  labor markets.  We are  even getting  someimprovement with respect  to  the  deficit.  There hasn't been muchdiscussion of  the deficit  recently;  in  fact,  I don't  think anybody haseven mentioned  it  today but  that's  something  one should  chalk up  inthe positive column.  Moreover, the  capability for  financing growthseems  to  be continuing  to strengthen.  Certainly, there  is  uncertainty3/22/94-36-in the  secondary markets, both  the bond and the  stock markets, but  theoverall  cost  of capital  remains  relatively low.  Banks  are  in a strongposition to  finance  further expansion.In  terms  of  the  outlook, I certainly can't disagree with thenotion  that whether we  characterize this  as  an expansion or  arecovery, it  is  sustainable  and it may well be  at  or  above potential.Perhaps  somewhat  like Mike Kelley, I've  been asking myself whether  ornot  this  is  a picture  that's  too good  to  be true.  I do  think thatthere are  some  checks  on potential  runaway growth.  Maybe this  is  theproverbial  soft  landing  that Mike Prell  referred to.  Re-engineeringis  definitely entrenched in  corporate  culture.  The focus  is  on costsavings and improved productivity.  There is  a flip  side,  of  course,with respect  to  job quality.  Even  though we are  seeing job growth,the question remains  as  to what kind of  quality there  is.  So  in asense that  is  a check  on growth.  We have  a low saving rate;  LarryLindsey has  spoken about  that  recently.  I have a hard time believingthat current  household consumption  levels can  remain at  the same  rategiven the  income growth rates  that we have  seen recently.  There  is  acontinued international drag;  with our  trading partners being weaker,we are certainly the  ones  that  are  leading  this  growth.With respect  to  inflation, certainly the  recent history  isexcellent,  but again we have  to  focus  on the  future.  It's hard toknow when there  is  a problem with respect  to  when are we  shifting fromdisinflation  to either  a flattening or an  increasing trend.  Certainlywe can  look to  some  of  the underlying price series,  includingcommodity prices.  While  commodity price  run-ups are not  sufficient  tocause CPI  increases,  they would be necessary.  So,  while  the  increaseswe  are  seeing may not  work their way into  the  CPI  eventually, Icertainly  think it's  a signal  that  should put us  on alert.  There aresome vulnerabilities  with respect  to  future price movements.  Low cropcarryovers  this  spring make  food prices  quite vulnerable  to whateveris  experienced with respect  to  the  1994  harvest.  Oil prices have beenobviously benign.  They have been the  very thing  that has  kept  ourrecent  inflation performance  very good.  I guess  I have  a healthyskepticism.  Maybe  I stood in  some  of  those oil  lines  too  long  to becomfortable with declining oil  prices.  We  are  still not  sure how thehealth care  reform movement  is  going  to  shake out.  The  economy hasbeen running ahead of potential,  and if  it  continues  at  that  samepace,  eventually at  some point we are  going to  see price pressures.We  already are hearing  some anecdotal  discussions  of bottlenecks  andsupply shortages.  So  I think there  are  some vulnerabilities  eventhough price  increases haven't yet shown up  in the  inflationstatistics.In  terms  of assessing  the risks  to  the  economy, I guess  Icome  to  the  conclusion--and maybe  it's because  I've  spent  a lot of  mylife in  the markets--that perhaps  the markets  themselves may be one  ofthe  sources  of vulnerability.  I think  they are undergoing  a greatdeal  of  sorting out  right now.  Market adjustments  are notinstantaneous,  though  if  everybody heads  for  the  door  at  the  sametime, we  could get  a massive movement.  But given the very complicatedsets of portfolios  now in markets--and  I don't mean just  hedge fundsor pension  funds  or  financial  institutions, but portfolios  throughouteven  the  manufacturing sector--I  think  the price  movements  that  onecan get  as  interest rates  change may be  somewhat  exacerbated when  itoccurs.  The  steepness  of  the yield curve  in  fact may be  exacerbating3/22/94-37-the problem.  We were going through a shift  in expectations with  longrates  coming down;  maybe the  decline  overshot last  fall;  I don't knowthat we are  ever going  to  know that  fully.  But  the process was underway last  fall  and long rates  were  shifting down.  When the Fedtightened, to  use a bad analogy, that  threw a monkey wrench into  thegears  of  the market  system and participants are having  figure  it outand work out  a new direction.  Part  of  the problem  is  that  it  is  notclear what unwinding of  portfolios and  adjustments are being made.Sometimes we get mixed signals  because portfolio positions  are very,very complicated.  The markets  themselves  I think are  certainly areflection of  this  changing, shifting portfolio  adjustment processthat  is  occurring.  This whole process  is  compounded by other kinds  ofuncertainties,  domestic/political uncertainties,  Korea, potentialtrade wars with Japan and China, and  trading partner weaknesses.  Forme  the  bottom line  is  that  the markets  don't need any more uncertaintywith which to  deal.  So whatever we do,  we  shouldn't  let  the marketsget  in the way of  economic  recovery or expansion, however wecharacterize it.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think we have heard today avery optimistic  view outside  of New York and Washington  and a verypessimistic view from  those of  us  in New York and Washington.  I hopeit's natural  for people  in Washington to be pessimistic;  you just  haveto  live here and watch it.  [Laughter]  But  I've  decided that  everyoneis  right.  I think  the reason comes  down  to  the  fact  that  the realafter tax return to  riskless  saving is  negative.  And that  is  ourproblem.  The natural  response  to  that  situation is  that  people firstof  all  go  into durables  and housing, as  they have been doing.  Indeed,I think  the last  time that  the  rush  into real  assets was as  great wasprobably 1979  when the real  after tax return  to  riskless  savings wasalso probably as negative  or more negative than  it  is  now.  The  otherthings people  do are  to  take  on more risks,  avoid the  tax man, and goabroad for new opportunities.I just want  to throw out  a few fun  facts.  In  1993  the risein  the  dollar value  of  the Hong Kong  stock exchange was  almost halfthe  rise  in the  dollar value  of  the New York stock  exchange.  HongKong  is  an emerging market and they have  lots  of  reasons  to beoptimistic about  China, but  the  fact  that  it grows half  as much indollar terms  I think suggests  that people  are  running overseas  insearch of  higher returns.  I'm a little more concerned when  I see thatthe  rise  in the  value of  the Bangkok stock exchange was  $51  billioncompared to  $432 billion  in  the NYSE and  that  the Ankara  stockexchange--I wonder what percentage of  the American people  couldidentify Ankara on a map of  the world--was  $42  billion, almost a tenthof  the  increase in  the value  of New York stock exchange  stocks.Home  equity loans  and mortgages  in general because  of  theirtax  favored status  have reached levels  that  clearly suggest  that  thefunds  are being used for consumption purposes and not  simply forbuying new homes.  They may also  be used to  fund  tax shelteredinvestments, which have also  reached new record shares  of  totalsaving.  In addition, at  the  end of  the year margin debt hit  a levelas  a ratio to  disposable personal  income not  seen since  the monthafter  the Chairman  joined the  Board of  Governors, and we know whathappened shortly after that!  Margin debt  fell precipitously, we know3/22/94-38-that.  Again, people  are reaching for  risk;  it  is  also  a tax favoredmethod of borrowing because up to  a limit  it  is  tax deductible.  Ithink,  therefore,  that we  can have  a booming economy and  at the  sametime  have the  very high  risk situation  that Bill  McDonough talkedabout and that my colleagues  on  the Board just  discussed.  Both aretrue.  The  answer,  I think,  is  to  raise  the  real  after tax return toriskless saving.  My preference  for how to  do  that would be  largely  inthe  fiscal  policy area, but  I'm not going to  hold my breath.  So,although I'm leaping to  the next agenda  topic,  I would go  for what  wecan do.

MR. KOHN.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Don,  in  the  early part of your remarks,  you madereference to  the  credibility of  the Committee's  commitment  to, youused the word,  "contain" inflation, and later in your remarks yousaid,  "to contain inflationary pressures or  to reduce  them  further,  ifthat  is  your objective."  So,  again, you were using the  words thatMike used earlier  in his  remarks  about  containing  inflation, and  Idon't know what happened to  the rhetoric about  the objective  ofreducing inflation, a route moving toward price  stability.  If  it'sthe  staff's interpretation that  this  Committee has  changed  its  long-term objective based on what we  submitted in  the  February meeting,then I think maybe  in  our May meeting we ought  to  schedule adiscussion as  to what are  the  long-term  objectives  of  this Committeeto  give you guidance as  to what kind of policy input we need.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I'm not  sure  I can add very much to what Mike  saidin response to your previous question except  to  say that my words  inregard to  alternative C were meant  to  suggest that  strong action--50basis points now and likely  considerably more down  the  road--wouldprobably be more  consistent with getting  inflation down  than the  moregradual, though not very gradual,  path in  the  staff  forecast.  I thinkit's  the  same  issue.  In  effect,  the staff  forecast has  inflationleveling out  at  3 percent.  In  the  judgment  of  the  staff,  given ourassessment  of  spending and inflation pressures,  stronger action may beneeded to bring inflation down.  And that's what  I tried to  convey--

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Did I read too much into your  expression  "or  toreduce  further, if  that  is  the Committee's  objective"?  It  sounds  tome as  if  you are  doubting that  that  is  our objective.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I was  just  suggesting that  that's  the  alternativeyou ought  to  consider  if you really want  to  bring inflation  down andmake measurable progress.  That would be  one  reason for looking atalternative C.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Recently, growth  rates  of  the narrow measures  ofmoney have  slowed and the broad measures,  if  you adjust  them for  stock3/22/94-39-and bond flows,  have  slowed.  The only measure that  has  acceleratedhas  been the monetary base and  that's  entirely in  currency.  Where  isthe currency going?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We don't have  current data  on that.  We do have  asense  that  the  flows  overseas  are  large.  I don't  think we have a goodfix on where  they are  going, especially since where they might goinitially--suppose they went  to  Switzerland or  something like  that--doesn't  indicate what  the  final destinations  might be.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  In  the last  couple of  months,  interest  rateshave  risen a good bit and all  the monetary aggregates  that  count  inthis  country have  slowed.  Would you say we have  had a significanttightening already?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I tried to  suggest  that  some  of  the  slowing mightbe in  response  to  the  rise  in  interest  rates,  though ordinarily wewould think that  it  would take  longer.  On M3  in particular, we havethese  institution-only money  funds  that are very sensitive  to  smallchanges  in interest  rates,  and we  think that  accounts  for asubstantial part  of  the minus 7-3/4  percent M3  in February.  On M2  andon M1,  I think we have a somewhat different  phenomenon.  A lot  of  thatis  in the mortgage prepayments  and, in  fact,  they have come  off,  asyou  know, as mortgage rates have  risen since last  October.  That has  atemporarily depressing effect on M1  deposits,  which we expect  to  comeback.  So if  anything,  I would think that M1  has  dipped below itslonger-term  trend  or what we might  expect  over the  longer run andmight  come back a little.  But with higher  interest rates, we wouldcertainly expect M1  in particular  to  slow substantially  from the  10percent plus  pace of  the  last  few years.  That would be  our analysis.M2  is  more  questionable.  We think that M2  does  respond at  least  for awhile  to  higher interest  rates,  but then we have questions  about theeffects  of  higher interest  rates  on  the  flows  to  the stock and thebond funds.  So  the  effect of  higher interest  rates, particularly ifaccompanied by rising bond yields  and  capital  losses, on people'spreferences  for M2  versus bond and stock  funds may muddy those waters.But we would expect  higher rates  to damp M2  growth  a little,  at  leastfor  a time.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  It  sounds  as  if  you're  saying the  signals arejammed.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If nobody else has  questions, why don'tI get  started.  I'd  like  to  take  a minute  to put  the  current period insome historical perspective.  We have  had extraordinary financialturmoil,  and  it's worthwhile to  go back in  time  and see where it  camefrom  and where  it's  likely to  go.  My impression  is  that  we  arelooking at  the  aftermath  of  the  1987  stock market  crash, which  is  thefirst  and perhaps  the  only major  stock market  crash in history  thatactually was beneficial to  the  economy.  In other words,  it  appearedto me  in retrospect that  the crash stripped out a high degree ofoverheating and sort  of  got right  to  the  edge  of  where the  overheatinggot  into  the muscle of  the  economy and stopped.  We came  out  of  itwith a very shaken  environment but  one which recovered relativelyquickly.  As  a consequence of  that,  from  the  1987  stock market crashon,  all  the  key risk  spreads  started to narrow.  We  saw it  in,  say,3/22/94-40-the rates  on  six-month commercial paper versus  the Treasury bill  rate;we  saw it  in BAA corporates versus  Treasuries.  The only abnormalityis  the  junk bond trend which was affected by the  emergence  of  thatwhich has  led increasingly to  the view implicit  in  the  market  thatthere  is  a risk-free  environment and one  that  incoporates, as  we havenoted previously, extraordinary  rates of return on  stocks  and bonds.Those  returns not only have  been significantly higher  than average butremarkably  stable.  There  has been very  little volatility in  the  stockemergence  of  a huge mutual  funds  industry, which was able to  promiseabove average yields  and stable yields.  I don't know the  size  of  theindustry now--$2  trillion or  something like  that--but  it  has becomethe major player  in the  marketplace.Everything we know about markets  is  that  abnormal rates  ofreturn,  especially those built on capital  gains,  cannot persist.Indeed, the  closest example  of  this  in recent  times was  the pre-European currencies.  You will  recall  that  the  Swedish kronor wasyielding significantly more than most money market  instruments  and thedeutschemark.  So  everyone  figured  that  the  kronor was  locked into  thedeutschemark, and investors took positions  in  the Swedish kronor  athigh  interest rates, hedged  it  in the  deutschemark/dollar market,  andgot  blown apart.  This  sort  of  led  to  the beginnings of  the ERMfalling  apart.I think we are  looking  at  something not terriblysignificantly different  in  this  current situation.  Prior  to  our moveon February 4th,  the market had drifted  into  a state  of  somnambulanceat  low risk premiums,  and there were steady upward price pressures.While we  all recognized at  the  time  that  the  stock market was  a littledicey and we were worried about the mutual  funds,  I don't  think wewere  aware of  the  apparent underlying  speculative  elements  involved inthe  markets  on a worldwide basis  that  I think  our February moveunearthed.  I think it was  a wakeup  call which basically got  everyoneto  look up and say:  How  long can  this  go  on?  And if  our wakeup  callhad not  occurred on February 4th,  there would have been another wakeupcall  coming some  other time  within days, weeks,  or months.  I believewe  in  effect dislodged a brick  from an edifice when it  was vulnerableto being hit  by something.  What actually eventually hit  it  was  thePhiladelphia Federal  Reserve's  February publication.  That morning  theCPI  came  out at  zero and  the bond market  took  off;  it  rose to  6.39percent  on  the  30-year bond, which was  10  basis points  above  its  levelbefore  we moved, and by the  end of  the day the  Philadelphia Fed  indexfor February came  out,  it closed  at  6.54  percent.  Now, it  wasn't  thePhiladelphia Federal  Reserve index  itself  that moved the market;  thatwas  a catalyst.  The way we knew that  is  that when the  March indexcame  out  and the index turned  around, the bond market  tried to  rallyand it  rallied  for about  10  minutes  and got  its head cut  off.  Soreally, these are  secondary catalysts  to  a far more  fundamentalrestructuring that's going on.  Views  of  the market  structure  areundergoing a major review at  this  stage and portfolios  are undergoingdramatic  changes.  We have seen  some  increase in yield spreads butthey are  still  quite low by any historic standard, which suggests  tome  that  the  adjustment process  in  the capital markets,  in  theportfolios  of  pension  funds, mutual  funds,  and  individual households,still  has  a long  way to  go.  I'm not  saying that means  that  interest3/22/94-41-rates  have  to adjust;  I mean that portfolios are  out  of  kilter and  arestill  being adjusted.When we moved on February 4th,  I think  our expectation wasthat we would prick  the bubble  in  the  equity markets.  What  in  factoccurred  is  that,  as  evidence  of  the  dramatic  shift  in  the  economicoutlook began to  emerge after we moved and long-term rates  began tomove up and hence  the discount  factor  on stocks began to  move up, wewere also  clearly getting a major upward increase  in expectations  ofcorporate  earnings.  While  the stock market went down  after ouractions on February 4th,  it  has  gone  down really quite marginally onnet  over  this period.  So what  has  occurred is  that while this  capitalgains bubble  in all  financial  assets had to  come down,  instead of  thebond area.  But  the  effects  are  the  same.  These  are major capitallosses,  which have  required very dramatic changes  in actions andactivities on  the part  of  individuals  and institutions.  I believethere was  a view that  the capital  gains  in  the bond markets werelargely permanent because  the  economy was perceived as  coming off arelatively high fourth quarter but would begin to  ease at  a somewhatfaster pace, and it  didn't do  that.  And this  development  created avery significant  shift as  to  where the capital  losses  occurred,although it  may not  have  significantly altered what the  actualpossible losses  overall would have been, combining  the  stock and thebond markets.With the  improved economic  outlook, risk premiums haveremained quite low.  And  the reason  they are  continuing quite low isthat  the risk  to  the  economy is  not perceived to  be  a crucial  one.  Soeven though we had some pickup--for example the  risk spreads  of  thesix-month commercial  paper vis-a-vis  the bill rate have  gone upmoderately--it's the  first  rise  in a long time and the  spread is  stillbasically low.There  is  a very strong view, which is  reflected  around thistable,  of  a very solid economic outlook.  Indeed,  I'm hard pressed toremember when the  outlook itself  looked as unequivocally expansionaryas  it  does  today.  We  are  always able  to  find  reasons why  it's  goingto  cave,  and there  are  lots  of  different  figures  we can adduce.  Theonly real  danger  to  this  economic  outlook, as  I see  it  right now, isthe  financial  structure.  And that,  as  I think  the Vice  Chairman said,has a low probability of  inducing a downturn.  But  if  the  financialsystem were to be  ruptured,  it would not be terribly difficult  tobring the economy down very quickly.  If  you want precedents  for  that,I suggest  that you merely go back and  read the business  annals  that  goback 50  or  100 years.  They  show economic  conditions  lookingabsolutely terrific  three weeks before  the roof  caves  in.  So  theoutlook  is  one thing;  history I think has  to  temper it.  Nonetheless,there  is  no doubt about  the  very strong underlying forces  in theeconomy.The  one area, as  I think I said at  the  February meeting, thathas potential  upside risks  is  the  inventory situation, which continuesto be  fairly tight.  I think the  lead  times  are probably just nowbeginning  to move out.  Somebody here mentioned steel mill  inventoriespicking up;  I've heard some  of  that myself.  We  are beginning to getthe  first  signs  that  the  inventory numbers may be moving up,  and if3/22/94-42-that's  the  case,  that would maintain a higher  level  of  economic growththan  I think we  otherwise would have  gotten.There  is  no  question  that  we have cut  the tail  of  theprobability distribution for  the  economic  outlook, even  though  in  amodal  sense  the  outlook itself  is  not all  that much higher  than it wassix months  ago  so  far as  1994  is  concerned.  There was a good deal  ofconcern  six months  ago that  the economy might  fade very fast.  Thetruth of  the matter  is  that  it has  not.  And in  the  event,  even  thoughthe  modal  expectation hasn't  changed, the probability distribution haschanged, and I think that's a major  factor  that has moved into  thebond market  and  the whole constellation  of  interest  rates.I thought  the most  interesting aspect of  the  discussionaround  this  table  today was  some  element of  surprise--and  I don't  knowhow to  phrase it  but  it  involves  almost  everyone with  the  exception ofAl  Broaddus.  Everyone is  concerned about  a pickup  in inflation,tightness  and stringency picking up,  and the  fact  that commodityprices  are moving, but  there is  no apparent  acceleration in  wages orfinal  goods prices.This raises  a very interesting issue  that we ought  to thinkabout.  I don't  know where  it  leads us,  but  a year or  so  ago  I raiseda question about  the  absence of  financial  tinder--meaning  credit,debt,  and money supply--in  the  economy, even as  the  economy waspicking up and we were beginning to  see  some  shrinkage  in  excesscapacity.  But  a year or  so ago, we had soft  inflation  and excesscapacity.  Looking  strictly at what the  data show to date,  theinflation  rate,  if  anything, is  somewhat  less  than we had expected.We have  very detailed data  for  January and February, or more  exactlyprobably half-way through February.  We  have very detailed data ondaily spot  prices  of  a lot  of  things.  And we have  some data  frompurchasing managers'  reports which have never been terribly usefulwith respect  to  inflation.  We have very  clearly seen some pickup inunderlying commodity prices;  we have  seen very little  evidence ofaccelerating  inflation  in any of  the  data on  final  prices.  Even theindicator.  I'm not  inclined to  pick pieces  of  it  and isolate  them,but  there was  a  .6 percent  increase  in owners'  equivalent  rent, whichwas way above  average.  If you bring that  down  to average,  that  takesoff  another tenth  of  a percentage point.The  reason I raise  this  question  is  that we have  an economywhich doesn't  look like anything  that we have  experienced  in  the  last30  years.  In the  last  30  years,  when we  saw a tightening of  slack  inthe  system, we  also saw a pickup  in credit  demands  and we  hadinflation.  That, however, has not been the  universal  experience  inthis  country.  If  we  go back to  the  1920s,  there were several  periodsof  significant tightness  in markets but no  significant  creditexpansion and no  inflation;  that was also  the experience even in  the1950s.  I raise  this  issue because we  are pretty far  along  in thisbusiness cycle.  So why is  inflation  not  showing  its  head a  littlemore?  Now, the next set  of  numbers  may come  out  and I'll  be  sorry Isaid this,  but the  earlier experience  raises the  question:  Is  itautomatically the  case  that when  the economy is  tightening up thatinflation  takes  hold?3/22/94-43-I would submit  that looking  at  the  simple  short-run Phillipscurve,  which is  what we  are doing,  without  a credit variable  in  it,shrinkage  of  credit has basically reflected balance  sheet  strain inthe  latter part of  the  1980s  and has  at  the  same time been associatedwith extraordinary weakness in  all  of  the aggregates.  To be  sure,there has been a pickup  in  credit--in loans  and debt, but  from verylow levels  and the numbers  do  not support,  at  least historically, anysignificant  inflation pickup.  I must  say that  I find this  wholeprocess very puzzling, because  it  does  not  seem likely  to me  that itcan continue  in  this way.  I'm sort of  waiting for the  credit numbersto  really begin to  move,  for  the patterns to  begin to  look like  thoseI have  found so  familiar, being a business  forecaster for  a number ofThere is  something different going on.  I don't know yet whatit means,  but there  are  two  facts  that  coincide with one another  thatat  least  should raise our  awareness.  One  is  that  we  are not yetgetting  final  demand price increases,  and it  may very well be  that weare getting extraordinary productivity increases  that are  keeping unitlabor costs  down and the  competitive pressures  there.  That  is why, ofcourse, commodity prices, which are clearly going up, are  not workingtheir way through the  system in  a direct manner.  This  is  the  type ofsituation where we are  looking at  a credit picture  and a lack  ofinflation  that  is more reminiscent  of  the  '20s than of  the  last  30years.  And that  is  something we ought  to keep  in mind, because  if  weare basically going to presume that  there  is  an automaticrelationship,  I think  there  is  at  least a question as  to whether thatis  true.  I'm not  sure that  really affects what policy should bebecause  I don't  think there  is  any question that  at  some point  and insome manner,  if we have  accommodative monetary policy at  the  centralbank, credit has  to  become excessive  and it has  to become  inflationaryor all  of our  concepts  about  how the monetary system works will haveto  go  into a radical  revision, which I can't  at  this  stage  evenremotely contemplate.Where  this  leaves me, putting  the  inflation  issue  aside forthe moment,  is  that  I think we have to  restore policy to neutrality asfast  as we can.  What  I really have in mind here  is  to  eliminate theexcess  degree  of  accommodation, which I assume  is basically  feasible.If we were  dealing  strictly with the  economic  outlook as  it  standsnow, there  is  no  doubt  in my mind that  this  economy could absorb avery large  increase  in  interest rates without  a problem.  Thedifficulty I have  is  that  I don't  think the  financial  system can takea very large increase  without a break in  its  tensile  strength--whichwe  strained significantly the  last time  but  did not break.  It's  arisk,  frankly, that  I think we should be  quite concerned about.So, we have  the  issue of,  one,  moving as  fast  as  we can andtwo, doing  it  in a manner that  doesn't break the markets.  But as  Isee  our objectives  here,  there is  another  characteristic  as well.  Oneof  the  elements  that  I think we have  all been  observing with respectto  the markets--and one  of  the  reasons why there has been such  a levelof  instability  in  the markets--is  that when we were perceived asmoving on the basis  of  economic data,  the  markets had a certain  senseof what  it was we were doing.  Now, Jerry Jordan doesn't  like  thatapproach to policy and I have considerable  sympathy  for his point ofview, but  it  did give  the marketplace  a semblance  of  knowing what  we3/22/94-44-were doing.  Now they are worried that  they  don't know when we aregoing to move, so we  have this  Sword of  Damocles hanging  over  thedays,  or  12  days;  they have no basis  to  judge and they areunderstandably nervous.  So  the question is,  having very consciouslyand purposely  tried to break the bubble  and upset  the markets  in orderto  sort  of break  the cocoon of  capital  gains  speculation, we  are nowin  a position--having done  that  and in a sense  succeeded perhaps morethan we had intended--to  try to restore  some degree  of  confidence inthe  System.  And that  means we have  to  find  a way, if  at  all possible,to move  toward a policy stance  from which we will  not be perceived asabout  to  move again  in any  short period of time.That essentially leaves us,  as  far  as  I can  see, with  twooptions:  moving the  funds  rate up 25  basis points  or  50  basis points.I don't  think we have an  option,  incidentally, of  doing nothing.There  is  no case that  I feel  comfortable with for doing nothing, so  Iwould frankly reject  "B."  But  leaving  that  option aside,  I do  thinkwe have  an  interesting choice.  A 50  basis point  increase would movethe  funds  rate  to  3-3/4 percent.  In my judgment  that would not beperceived of  as neutrality or where we ultimately have  to be.  My ownview is  that  eventually we have to  be at  4 to  4-1/2 percent.  Thequestion is  not  whether, but  when.  If  we were  to move  50  basispoints,  I think we would create  far more  instability than we  realize,largely because a half point  is not  enough to  remove  the question ofwhere we ultimately are  going.  I think  there  is  a certain advantagein  doing 25  basis points  because the markets,  having  seen two moves ina row of  25  basis points  at  a meeting, will  tend almost surely toexpect  that the next move will  be  at  the next  meeting--or at  least  Ithink  the probability of  that occurring  is probably higher  than 50/50.If  that  is  the case and the markets  perceive that--and they perceivewe are  going to  4 percent by midyear, moving only at meetings--then wehave  effectively removed  the Damocles Sword because  our action becomespredictable with respect  to  timing  as well as  with respect  todimension.  My own impression,  if  we  decide to move in  that  direction,is  that  the  last move we might want  to make--say, for example, thefunds rate was at  3-3/4 percent  and we decided 4-1/4 percent might beneutrality--is that perhaps we  should add 50  basis points  at  thatpoint.  That would ring  the  gong as  the  end and we  could in  effectwithdraw from the race, provided that during  this period risinginflationary pressures did not actually start  to become real  asdistinct  from prospective.So,  I must  say at  this point, having  struggled with thisissue  for quite a long time  and having given considerable thought  totrying  to convince myself  that  50  basis points might be  the best move,I come out  thinking that while  50  basis points  has  a very good logicalargument for  it,  it's  too  soon.  It  doesn't quite get us  there  and I'mnot  sure  that  it  gains  the advantages that we would want.  My owninclination at  this  stage--I may sound a lot  surer about what I thinkought  to  be done  than I am because we know the markets  are verytricky--is  to do  25 basis points  today, but  go  asymmetric because thechances  of  our lowering rates  in  the  intermeeting period  ought  to bezero.There  is  the possibility that  the numbers may  turn out  to bea lot stronger than we  are projecting--remember  that  the Greenbook hasindustrial production effectively slowing  in March.  In fact,  the3/22/94-45-weekly data results  for March point to  a decline,  not a rise,  so  thereis  also  the possibility that  this  expansion could slow  and ratify theGreenbook projection.  If  that  in  fact  turns  out  to be  the  case and weget a removal  of  any significant pressures,  then we have  theopportunity of maintaining a slow pace  in moving  up  into  a neutralpolicy area because  that has been our program all  along;  this hadnothing to  do with inflationary pressures.  If,  however, whollyindependently of  our process  of  going  to neutrality, we begin to seethat  this  economy is  not  slowing--or more  specifically, if  we  see thatinventories  are really beginning  to  move up, because  that's where  Ithink the vulnerability is--then we will have  a second set  ofimplement,  which as  far as  I'm concerned  we have  to  get  to,  but wewould have  an  added  factor on  top of  that--an  additional tighteningsuperimposed on  our move  to  neutrality because, in effect, we would beseeing an  economy that  is  actually beginning to  heat up.  My own  guessis  we are not going to  see  the economy heat up until  the  funds  rategets to  4 percent, meaning  that  I think we have enough time  to movemeeting by meeting, which  gets us  to  a 4 percent  federal  funds  rate atmidyear.  Then  I think we will  be in  a far  better position.That's  the way I came  out.  I took a lot  longer to  discussthis than usual because I've  been thinking about  it  longer--productively or  otherwise,  I'm not sure.  But  I lay it  out  as  it  seemsto me  and frankly am very interested in any counter-arguments  orissues  that people would like  to raise,  not only with respect  to  thepolicy but with respect  to all  the  pieces.  Where  I come  out reallydepends on  this  evaluation of  the outlook because what concerns me  atthe moment  is  not  the  economy;  the  economy looks  terrific  to me.  I'mworried that we could break the  back of  this  financial  system and  findout  in  retrospect not  only that  this situation has  the negativecharacteristics of  some  of  the  data of  the 1920s,  but we  could alsofind out  that  the  experience of  the  1987  stock market  crash, which wasbenevolent,  is  not  something that  is  likely to be  replicated.  Ed.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Well,  I think  the case  for a less  accommodativepolicy today is  quite persuasive.  We did press hard on  the monetaryaccelerator  to  get  the  economy moving, and now as  the  economyapproaches  cruising speed we have  to ease  off  the accelerator  to avoidhaving to  slam on  the brakes  down  the  road.  The  real  issue--the majorissue as  you point out, Mr. Chairman--is how much to move.  I prefer a1/2  percentage point  increase  in the  federal  funds  rate compared to1/4  because I think we have  some  distance to go  to  get  to  a neutralpolicy, and it's better  to  cover that distance earlier rather  thanlater.  Also, I think  a 1/4  point  increase  is  so  small,  given wherethe economy is,  that  it  will  set  off  almost immediate  speculationabout  the next move.  So we will  just repeat what we  have gone  throughin recent weeks.  I think a more decisive  1/2  point  increase  canreduce uncertainty, especially  if  accompanied by an appropriateannouncement.Now, there  are  always  risks to  decisive action.  One risk  isthat we might be  overestimating the  strength of  the economy, and aless accommodative monetary policy might damp  its  growth too much.Given the  underlying strength that we see,  that  appears  to me to be  asmall  risk, and the  best protection against  that  kind of  risk is  awillingness  on  our part  to  reverse course if  need be.  I think thegreater  risk is  that we may have gone  too slowly  in raising rates  for3/22/94-46-this  stage  of  the economic recovery.  Historically, waiting too  longto  adjust rates has been a greater risk, and I think it's  the one  thatwe need to  be especially sensitive  to  in  this current  environment.  Iam sensitive  to  the  financial  risks  that you point  out, but  I must  saythat  in  one  form or  another that  has been the  argument  around  thetable  for not moving  in  the past  when we  should have moved.  It  alsohistorically, but my guess  is  that  if  we push on  this  economy, we willget  inflation and we will end the  growth.  So  one  can come  up withlots  of arguments,  some  subtle, some not.  I think the  important  thingis  to  stick to  the basics  and go to  the  heart of  the matter.  We havean  economy  that  is  telling us  that  we need a less  accommodativemonetary policy, and in my view we  ought  to move  in  that directionthey end up getting better  results  than if  they try to  outsmartthemselves  and consider all  the angles  in the  curve.  So,  I think weought  to  go  to  the heart of  the matter.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, I think  that robust growth  in realGDP  in recent  quarters has  sharply diminished the  slack in both  laborand product  markets.  And if  growth does not  slow as much asanticipated, we could be  facing  significant upward pressures  oninflation.  Despite  the action  taken at  the  last  meeting,  the realfederal  funds  rate still  appears  to be,  in  my view, unsustainably low.I think those who  favor moving  toward a neutral policy stance  shouldtherefore  support a significant  increase in the  federal  funds  rate.Even if  a neutral stance were to  require a real  funds  rate  of  only1 percent, we would still  need a large  increase in  the  nominal  rate toreach that  level.  Those who  favor  such things  as  nominal  incometargeting  rules should  also support  a significant  increase in  thefederal  funds  rate.  We have  looked at  various nominal  income  rules,and they suggest  that we  fell behind the curve at  the  last meeting andthat  we now need a large  increase to  catch up.  And  finally, financialinterest rates  over  the next  six months.  Thus,  I feel  that  a 50 basispoint  increase is  needed.  An  increase of  25  basis points  wouldprobably not be  sufficient to prevent  an  increase  in  inflation andcertainly would not be  sufficient  to make  further progress  in reducinginflation.  Therefore, my first preference would be Bluebookalternative  C.  However, since  I believe  that whether we  do thingstoday  or a couple of  weeks later  doesn't make all  that much differencein terms of  impact on  the  economy, I certainly could accept  25  basispoints  today  if  we had asymmetric language  to  the up  side  and at  leastthe  possibility that  a move could come prior to  the next meeting.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Let me  just  say that I agree  100 percent withEd Boehne.  He said  it very well;  he really reflected my positioncompletely.  I have just  a couple of  comments.  Again, as  I suggestedearlier, despite  the  good news  on current  inflation at  this  juncture,we can see  clear  signs  that  an  inflationary psychology is  building,and  I think that's reflected most  clearly  in bond rates.  Youmentioned historical perspective.  From an historical perspective,  Iwould like  to  suggest  that  the  hallmark of  our monetary policystrategy in the  1980s was that when these kinds  of  episodes  occurred3/22/94-47-and we got  into this  type of  situation, we  reacted.  My own view isthat maybe not all,  but a significant part,  of  the  substantialprogress we made  in  that decade  in  bringing inflation rates  down fromclose to  14  percent  to close  to 3 percent  currently, reflects thatstrategy, and I would be  reluctant  to  abandon  it.  Moreover,  if  onelooks  at  that period in  some detail, when we were willing  to move moreaggressively--and I would say that  included the  spring and summer of'83  and the  spring and summer  of  '84--we got pretty good results  andrather quick results with respect to  inflationary psychology and bondrates.  In  contrast,  when we have moved more  slowly, such  as  in theearly months  of  1987,  the results have not  been as  favorable.  So,against  that background, I think we need to move  aggressively now todeal  with  this growing inflationary psychology.  I have  a very strongpreference  for  alternative  C.  Are  there risks  in doing  that?  Yes,there  are.  But my own  feeling is  the  same  as  Ed Boehne's--that therisks  are at  least  as  great  in not  taking  this action;  I think thereis  a good chance that we would be  seen as  too  cautious  and  tootentative.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I think I'm with you with amodification.  We definitely want  to  send a signal to  the market, andI think that  there  are  two ways  of  doing that.  One, which  is  not anoption before us,  is  to go  to  a number that  is  a credible--a roundnumber  that people would  say is  the natural  rate.  One mightcontemplate a 75  basis point  increase to  4 percent.  I'm notrecommending that, but  one  could suggest  that.  It  would be  clear tomind doesn't  indicate  anything.  It  doesn't  suggest that we  are goingto  stop at  4 percent;  it  doesn't  suggest we  are  going to  stop  at4-1/4 percent;  it  doesn't  suggest  that we  are going  to  stop at  4-1/2percent.  It  does  suggest  that  we have  another increase  coming downthe road.  Since  I don't  think a 75  basis point move  is  credible  and Idon't  think 50  basis points  sends  the signal  of  certainty, I foundyour suggestion of  25  basis points probably preferable.  But where  Idisagree  is  on  the  asymmetric directive because  the great benefit of  amove at  this meeting with  the  intent  that  we  are probably going tomove at the next meeting and at  the meeting after that  is precisely toremove this uncertainty that we  are going  to move  on  some odd Thursdayin April,  which is  one of  the  things  that  was  spooking the market  lastmonth.  So,  while I have no disagreement at  all  that we want to  getthere as  quickly as  possible,  in my mind a move of  25  basis pointsnow, 25  in May and 25  on  July 5th seems  to  be a pattern that  will  getus  there  in  splendid time.  No one  can accuse  us  of upsetting theare headed to  a fixed point that  is  higher  than I think we wouldachieve with  50 basis  points.  So  I would vote for  25,  symmetric.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  just  respond  to  that because Ihave great  sympathy for  the point you are making.  Ideally, we  shouldbe  symmetric  for exactly the  reasons  that  you state.  The problem  thatI have with it  is  that  I'm thinking of  two  separate potential  monetarypolicy paths, which may be additive.  In  other words,  if  the  situationis  evolving in a relatively stable manner, then  the  symmetric  languagereinforces  the  fact  that we  are moving only  at particular times.  Theprobability of  our easing  is very small,  and I think we can probablyhandle  the problem  that you raise  in  the  way the minutes  are written.3/22/94-48-In other words,  the minutes  could reflect our  thinking that theasymmetry is  not a break  from this pattern but a wholly differentoption  in  the  event  that our  evaluation is  inappropriate.  That's  theway  I would look at  it.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  the minutes won't be seen until after thenext meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  true, but  nobody will  know thedirective was  asymmetric until they see  the minutes.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I know, so  what  we are  talking about is  how weare going  to  look in  the  future?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me put  it  this way.  As  far as  I'mconcerned, the asymmetry  is  there  only in the  event that  the economyor  inflation begin  to  look much stronger than we  at  the momentanticipate.  Now,  if  that  occurs,  one  other possibility is  that  we canleave  the directive  symmetric  and decide to  go  with a conference call.That's another possibility.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I would prefer  that.  It's  more  internallyconsistent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  the  equivalent,  as  far as  I'mconcerned.  In  fact, we are  in such an important period of  theexpansion that  I think the more we talk with each other,  the betteroff  we are.  I find consultation  frankly quite useful.  PresidentJordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  With regard to  the early part ofyour  remarks,  I agree very much that we need to  think differentlyabout what  influences  the purchasing power of money.  It has nevermade  sense  to me  to  think that  growth per se  reduces  the purchasingpower  of money.  That's  really a phenomenon of  the last  few decades,when we  got  into  this  notion of  demand management, which  I haveincreasing trouble with as  the way to  think about how monetary policyor fiscal  policy influence  the purchasing power of  money.  Of  course,I have a lot  of  problems with Phillips curves  and gap  or  slack typemodels.  When we  think about  individual  sectors  of  the  economy,agriculture being the most notable,  if  we have  a spontaneous  increasein output--what we would call bumper  crops or economists  would call  anexogenous  increase--that reduces prices  of  agricultural products.That's  true, really, with most  sectors of  the  economy.  Otherwise wecall  it a productivity  increase--something we can't  explain  is  calleda productivity increase.  That's  the nature of  a capitalist  system;that's what you would expect  to  happen in the  market economy.  Thatis,  the  inherent resiliency to  expand, removing the depressing  forces,does  not mean per  se  that  the purchasing power of money should erodeat a faster rate.That  view says  to me  that we don't want  asymmetry if  there  isa possibility that  asymmetry would trigger an  action related  to growthbecause  it  would characterize this  Committee  as basically not likinggrowth.  We see  the  economy growing  fast, and therefore  we are goingto  react  against  that;  I have a lot of problem with that.  I thoughtMike Kelley's remark about  caution  in interpreting where we are wasvery useful;  it's  very worthwhile  to  think  about that.  Mistakes  are3/22/94-49-made  in conducting monetary policy.  Occasionally,  somebody has  to  say"Oops."  We know that's  going to happen;  policy mistakes will  be made.So  it  comes down  to  a question of which mistakes we find most easy  tocorrect  or  least damaging to  the  economy once we realize  that we havemade a mistake.  That's  similar to  the  comments  that Ed Boehne wasmaking about where  the  risks  are.  If we  assume that  the  economy  is  ona satisfactory path now, a gliding path  toward some notion of  itscapacity and  inflation is  not accelerating and later we  find out wewere wrong,  that  is  a very costly thing to  correct.  Whereas  if  weassume that  we have  stayed too  easy too  long  and we need to move veryquickly  to  get  to  this  ideal  neutral policy stance, and we  find out wewere wrong, that's  a relatively easier thing  for us  to  correct,politically and in  other ways.In  a world where we do not have monetary aggregates  to  guideus as  to  the  thrust of  monetary policy actions,  we are kind of gropingaround just  trying  to  characterize where the  stance  is.  I don't knowwhere  neutral  is.  But  if  I were out  in  the northern part  of  GaryStern's District,  I wouldn't  know where  the border between  Canada andthe United States  is.  For  that matter if  I were  in a sailboat  in themiddle  of Lake  Erie,  I wouldn't know where  the border  is  located.  Butthat  doesn't  mean that  it's not a very useful idea  to  think that  thereis  a border there.  And  it's  a useful  idea  to think  that  there is  sucha thing as  a neutral policy stance.  I feel very strongly that we  arenowhere near a neutral  stance and that we  ought to be aggressive  inmoving  toward it.  The only way I would be comfortable with 25  basispoints  is  if  I were assured that  it  was going to  be accompanied by anaction  of  the Board on  the discount  rate.  Absent  that,  I think itwould be  a mistake  to  go  25  basis points  at  this  time.  And I think itwould be a mistake  to  go to  asymmetric  in any case.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Well, maybe you stand where you sit  on theseissues.  Being  in the  First District  and not being  surrounded by signsthat  are as  optimistic  as  those that  give  rise  to  the optimism in  theother Districts,  we at  the  Boston Bank have had a lot  of  arguments  ingetting  ready for this  Committee meeting.  But  they tended  to be moreabout  moving up  25  basis points versus  doing nothing.  I think wecould buy into  25  basis points.  We  think that would be more  smoothingto  the markets  and would be  expected as  opposed  to a stronger movethat might not be  expected.  We also  believe  that with higher  ratesthere  is  the possibility of  a weaker economy than  the Greenbookprojects,  and we would not  like  that to  occur.  So  by and large wewould be in  favor  of  the  25  basis point  increase.  We would also be  infavor  of  a symmetric  directive  or a conference call  if  we want  to makea change.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  from our point of view, in termsof  the  evidence we  have seen,  there  is  a very good economic case  for amove of  50  basis points now.  I think we need to  get to  the higherlevel  sooner rather  than  later.  Based on  listening to your remarks  onthe  markets, however, I'm inclined to  go with Governor Lindsey'sproposal.  If we  are  trying  to bring some  certainty to  the markets, Ithink an asymmetric  directive would be wrong because when it  is  readafter  the May meeting, it would reintroduce uncertainty  in  the period3/22/94-50-between that meeting and the July meeting.  Such a directive meansthat  we might do  something between meetings and  I think  it  wouldconfuse people.  So,  I would favor a symmetric  directive to  go withthe 25  basis points.  And if  the  the  numbers  on  the  economy differfrom our expectations, we  can have  a conference  call  and make the

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman,  as we  try  to make a policyforecasts.  As  I look at  the Atlanta  forecast,  I see very rapid growthfor 1994,  much stronger than the  Greenbook, and inflation at  the  endof  1995 at  clearly unacceptable  levels.  But  as  I said  in my openingremarks,  I don't  think that's  the  likely outcome.  I think growth  isprobably going to  come  out  somewhere between the Greenbook and  theAtlanta  forecasts.  But  there is  some  reasonable probability that  theGreenbook forecast  could materialize.  And, therefore,  some caution  isneeded in  that regard.  I think gradualism has  served us very well  onthe  down side.  I would also  add that  I don't view a 1/4  pointincrease  as very insignificant at  this  level  of  interest rates;  itreally means something  in  the market.  In my judgment,  a gradualapproach will  create greater  stability than otherwise.  I also am verypersuaded by your remarks  about the  financial markets.  I remembervery well at  the  last meeting, when there was an  expression ofinterest on  the part of  some  to  move  50  basis points,  that yourlanguage was  in  effect:  "If we do  that, we are  going to crack  thecracking the markets.  Now, I'm not  saying  that  would happen again at50  basis points, but  I think we run that risk and I don't think that'sa risk we should  take.Therefore,  I think  the 25  basis points  is  clearly appropriatein  this particular environment.  The market  is  expecting somethinggreater over  the  course of  the next  several months,  so  I don't  thinkit's necessary to meet  those expectations at  this particular point.When I came  into  the meeting, I was  more in  favor of  a symmetricdirective and I still would  lean  in  that  direction, but  I cancertainly support  asymmetry.  In  sum, I think 25  basis points  is  theway we  should go.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I too believe  that rates  are toostimulative  and I think we  ought  to seek a neutral policy stance,wherever that  turns  out  to be.  I also believe  that  the  robustexpansion hypothesis  is  probably the most likely,  however robust maybe defined.  And  certainly both of  those points  suggest  that  the  fundsrate  should be moved up.  On the  subject of  timing,  I do not believethat  the  real  economy requires a tightening move  at  this  point but  Ithink the markets probably do;  so  I can go with  25  basis points.  I dofind the  25  basis points  argument compelling and I'd have  real  troublewith a move  of  50 basis points.  As  far as  asymmetry goes,  I don'tthink for  the  traditional  reasons  that  that  is  the best idea  on  itsmerits, but  I also  agree with Larry Lindsey's  suggestion that  it  wouldbe  confusing.  However,  I will not  dissent over  that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But  you would prefer  symmetry?3/22/94-51-

MR. KELLEY.  I would prefer symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  President Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Well, it  is  a tough  call.  I can't  remember atime that  the call  has been tougher than it  is  right now.  I can comeup with good arguments,  at  least in my own mind, for  and againsteither 25  or  50 basis points.  But  on reflecting,  I do  come downagreeing that  at  this  time  the  25  basis point move  is  the appropriatething to  do.  I would not be in  favor  of  asymmetric  language.  I wouldbe in  favor  of  symmetric  language, not because  I disagree with  thedirection of  policy--I  think we  will be moving again--but because  I'drather not make  it  such a regular  thing that  the moves are going to bedependent  on  the  timing of meetings of  the Federal  Open MarketCommittee.  I would be opposed  to establishing  that kind of pattern.Moreover,  I'm just  in  general  opposed to  asymmetric  language.  We hada very bad experience with asymmetric language  last spring and,therefore,  I'd prefer  to  leave  the language  symmetric.  I do thinkthat  the  economy is  going through a very dynamic phase and that  weshould keep  in pretty  current contact  as we go  through  this period.Therefore,  I'd be  in  favor  of  25  basis points now with symmetriclanguage but an understanding  that probably we would have a phone callbefore the  next meeting and might make  a change  at  that point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  As most people have  already stated,  it  certainlyseems appropriate  to act now.  How far we ought  to go  and how fast weought  to  try  to  get  there,  are  the difficult  questions.  My bestjudgment  is  that we'll be at  this  for  some time;  it  may well be  thatthe funds  rate has  to  go  to  4 percent  or more by the  time we are  done.But  I don't have a strong conviction about how far we will need  to go.As  to  the  timing issue,  it  seems  to me  that we are probably going tobe at this  until we  are either more  confident  than we  are  today thatwe have established an  environment  for renewed disinflation or untilwe actually see  renewed disinflation.  It may surprise  us and occurearlier or  something else may happen that  changes our view aboutappropriate policy.  But having  said all  that,  I think we should bearin mind, and I'm certainly willing to  be humble about all  this,  thatthe  confidence  interval  around  any forecast  is  very wide.  And I thinkthat argues  for  caution.  So,  I'm comfortable with your  1/4 pointrecommendation now.  I think that  is  the  appropriate magnitude.  And Iwould prefer a symmetric directive with  the  understanding that  if  weneed a conference  call,  we can have one.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  As  I've  expressed before, my view is thatmonetary policy has  been  in a very stimulative posture over the  lastthree years  and, like Al Broaddus,  I think  the quicker we  get  toneutrality, the better  off everyone  is  going to be.  I think thecumulative effects  of  that policy stance are being reflected alreadyin rising prices and certainly in rising  inflationary expectations.My own  judgment is  that we reacted too  cautiously to  thesedevelopments  at  our  last meeting, and that  contributed to uncertaintyin  financial markets  and has resulted  in higher long-term  interestrates  than we  otherwise might have seen.  I'm not  saying that  theywould have  gone down, but  I'm not  so  sure  they would have gone  up as3/22/94-52-much,  and I think 25  basis  points  at  this  stage runs  the risk of  thesame  sort  of  reaction.  Accordingly,  I favor moving more  aggressivelyat  this meeting to  an  increased degree  of  reserve restraint  through a50  basis point  increase in  the  funds rate.  And were  it  up  to me,  Imight  even be  inclined to underscore  that with a 50  basis pointincrease  in  the discount rate  and basically underline our  resolve  tocontain  inflationary pressures  and eventually resume progress towardprice  stability.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I certainly think it's  appropriate  to  tighten.For me  the  question is how to  get  there  as  fast  as  possible butwithout  causing disruption  in the  markets.  It  seems  important  to methat  the  Fed not  add to  the uncertainty.  So  for  that  reason, I cancertainly go  along with 1/4  point  increases.  But  I'd underline yoursuggestion of  emphasizing  in some  very constructive way when we  arefinished the  tightening process.  We  do  not want  to get  into  aprecedent-setting mode because I think when we were  easing  it wasimportant  to be able  to  do it  at  the  right  time.  So  I would prefernot  to  establish a precedent of  just  taking action at meetings.  I'mnot  sure what  asymmetric  language  adds.  To me  it may well  increasethe uncertainty.  So,  I'd be more  inclined not  to have  asymmetriclanguage.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mr. Chairman, not  to be  facetious, but  the 25basis point  approach sounds  to  me a bit  like taking down  that  Sword ofDamocles  and inflicting  the death of  a thousand cuts  on the  economy.It  dies  slowly in  anticipation of  the next  strike.  Instinctively, Iwould prefer  in the best  of  all worlds  a 50  basis point move  for  thesimple reason  that  if we  are wrong  and the economy is  moving  fasterthan we thought,  we would be seen  as having been a little  ahead of  thecurve, and we  could still  move  further.  That to  me  is  preferable tomaking  a move in between meetings in  reaction to  something that'spublished in  the press.  If  we are wrong on the  other  side  and  if  theeconomy is  significantly weaker,  then we  can  stop at  50  basis points;we won't need additional moves perhaps.  Or we don't  have  to  stop atthe  50  points;  we can  add another  25  if  necessary.  On  the other hand,I have great  respect  for your analysis of  the market  risks  involved ina 50  basis point move, and I will  reluctantly agree  to  the 25  basispoints with  symmetric  language.  That's  all.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, I must  admit  that  Ihave  been absolutely certain about  the need for a move of  both 50basis points  and 25 basis  points  at  least  as  frequently as  daily  inthe  last  several weeks.  But  I've come  to  the  conclusion  that yourrecommendation on  the  change  is  the  safer course of  action for us  andsufficiently bold to maintain our credentials.  If  the Greenbookforecast  is  accurate and if  it  should materialize quickly as3/22/94-53-projected, I think it  would be  good for  us  to  give  ourselves  theopportunity to  see  how the  economy  is  evolving, which also  leads me  tothe  25 basis point  increase.  Even  though every bit  of  my stomachlining says  we  are heading toward a funds  rate of  4 percent  or higher,I don't have any concern about waiting past  this  meeting.  So  I verymuch prefer the  25  basis points  just  for  economic reasons.The reaction  to our 25  basis point  increase  at  the  lastmeeting, as  Peter and Joan pointed out, was  added to enormously by  thevarious  other developments that  they mentioned.  There  is  a tendencyfor  financial  analysts  and maybe  ourselves  to  think that we  caused itall,  but we  certainly were  the  first  to  get  things moving.  So  I thinkwe got  a good deal more market  effect  and a good deal more tighteningout  of  25  basis points  than we had in mind when we met  on the  4th ofshould be  deciding monetary policy based on  trying to  fine-tune  theweakness  to  the  economy could come  from  a crack in the market.  As Isaid earlier and as you quoted me,  I think  that's not very probable,but  I think the  risk is  significant  enough  that  it's worth  takingseriously.  Therefore,  since  I cannot anticipate  exactly what  thereaction of  the market  would be  to  50  basis points  and since we hadsuch  an overreaction the  last time,  I think we are better  off to  avoida risk where the  risk/reward ratio  is  very difficult  to  calculate.As regards  symmetry or asymmetry, your reasoning  for theasymmetric directive  in a way introduces  a new use  of  the  asymmetricdirective,  or at  least  it's new to  me.  I think it  could be  explainedwith Don Kohn's usual  verbal  skills in  the minutes, so  it  is  somethingthat  I could live with.  Left to my own devices,  I would prefersymmetric;  but  if you prefer asymmetric,  I would support you on  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let  me  just  say that  I've been back  andforth on  this  symmetric/asymmetric  issue  and, as  far as  I'm  concerned,a conference call  serves exactly the  same purpose.  Indeed,  it mightactually be preferable because we  do gain benefits  from having  thesymmetric  language  in  the minutes.  So  I will  support  symmetric aswell and would propose  25  basis points and symmetric  language.  Wouldyou read the directive.

MR. BERNARD.  "In the  implementation  of policy  for theimmediate  future,  the Committee  seeks  to  increase  slightly theexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions.  In  the  context  ofthe Committee's  long-run objectives  for price  stability andsustainable  economic  growth, and giving  careful consideration  toeconomic,  financial,  and monetary developments, slightly greaterreserve  restraint  or slightly lesser  reserve  restraint might beacceptable  in  the  intermeeting period.  The  contemplated reserveconditions are expected to  be consistent with moderate  growth in M2and M3  over the  first half  of  1994."

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman, I know we  are somewhat  bound bytradition, but there  is  a sentence  that we really don't need aboutslightly more or  slightly less reserve restraint  during  theintermeeting period.  Why don't we  just drop  it?  That'll  take  care  ofyour  observation that  in fact  it's  slightly less probable  that aneasing  is  going  to happen.  It's  the  same  as being symmetric.3/22/94-54-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  still  have the  question of  theannouncement, and I call on Don Kohn to discuss  that.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I'll  try to be brief, Mr. Chairman.  Drawing onthe work of  the  subcommittee, Messrs.  Boehne, Kelley, and Melzerconsidered a couple of options  for announcing the  decisions  of  theFederal  Open Market  Committee.  What they hit  on  finally was  that  thebest  bet was  to  announce changes  in  our  instrument  settings much as wedid last  time but  just say what  we did.  That is,  in this  case wecould say, using the  wording proposed by Joe Coyne:  "The FederalReserve decided today to  increase  slightly the degree  of pressure onreserve positions.  This action by the  Federal Open Market Committeeis  expected to be  associated with a small  increase in  short-term moneyannouncement  could be  coupled with additional  explanations  if theCommittee  thought  that was necessary in unusual  situations,  but  theimportant  thing was  to get  out  the  fact  that we acted.One option that  the  subcommittee thought about  was releasingthe whole directive, but  that has  some  disadvantages.  That  wouldinvolve  releasing the  symmetries  and asymmetries  right  away andwhatever is  left  of  that  symmetry/asymmetry  flexibility would3/22/94-55-certainly go away because knowledge  of  that  decision does  moveOn balance, the  subcommittee  thought it  was  a good  idea  just  torelease  the decision.  The  reception from the public was  good lasttime.  The Fed looked and was more  open.  We  in effect  ran anexperiment that worked pretty well  from  that perspective.I think  there  is  one minor note  of hesitancy.  The Committeelooked at  this about  a year ago,  or maybe a little over  a year ago,and rejected this  announcement option.  The Committee was  concerned atthat time  that  it  would lose  some  flexibility.  There were  twoinstruments:  the  discount rate, which rang  the  gong;  and open marketoperations,  which didn't.  The February 4th experience,  although therewere a lot  of  special  things  involved, does  suggest  the possibilitythat  there might be stronger reactions  to announced moves both in  theopen market  operations  from time  to  time.  So  there  is  concern  aboutloss of  flexibility.  But  in  thinking about  this,  the balance  of  thecosts and benefits  in  the view of  the  subcommittee had  shifted towardthe  notion of announcing changes  in  instrument  settings when the  FOMCThere  are also a couple of  technical  issues.  One  is  when toannounce.  The  thought was  that  the  best  approach would be  to  set  amore  or  less  fixed  time  on  the afternoon  of  the day the  Committee met;that would be  this afternoon.  It  should be early enough  to  allowtrading  on the news  in  the markets but  late enough  so  that  the marketswouldn't  sit  around wondering how long the Committee  had met.  Thatis,  we would have  a reasonable prospect  of  being  finished our workbefore  the usual  announcement time.  We wouldn't want the  usualannouncement time  to  go by and have  the  Committee still  thinking aboutits  decision, but people  assuming that the  decision was  for policy  toremain unchanged.  So  the  time  should be  late enough so  that you wouldfinish the meeting but  early enough to be  traded in  the market,somewhere  around 2:15  p.m. to  2:30 p.m.  seems  about right  to BillMcDonough and to me.  What to  announce  I think I've already covered.The subcommittee did not  think  a decision for no  change had to beannounced;  only changes would be  announced.  And as  I noted, thesubcommittee  thought  that an  explanation  such as  we had last  timewould be  the  exception  rather  than the  rule.  That would help maintaina bit  of  a difference between a discount rate  action and open marketoperations.  I invite any of  the subcommittee members  to comment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman, I have  no problem at  all  withanything Don said as  far as  the statement  and when to  announce  it  areconcerned.  But  this  Committee  is  going  to be considering other  issuesregarding our openness  in the months  ahead.  And I don't  see  anyadvantage to  the  Committee in  separating  this issue, which is  a pro-openness  stand from other  issues that may incline us  toward  lessopenness  if we are  in  fact  going to be producing a package down  theroad.  So,  I would suggest  that  the  Committee not  act on  Don'sproposal  today.  But  it  is  certainly in  the power  of  the  Chairman tomake any announcement  he wishes.  My personal advice to  him would beto  go ahead and make  the announcement.  But  I think an announcement bythe  Committee would be  committing ourselves  to  a pro-openness move3/22/94-56-that would be  a card we would permanently lose  in the  future  forissues  on which we might not be as  open.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You're  just  suggesting that  it would bein  the  form  of a provisional  statement  similar  to  the  last  time.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Or that you make  the  statement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Meaning  in other words  that  it's  not anirrevocable decision of  the Committee but of  the Chairman?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That  is  correct.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan, I wanted to make a couple of  comments.First of  all,  I favor  announcing our actions promptly whether  they aretaken at  meetings or between meetings.  My preference would be to  makethis  change when we act  on  the  other disclosure  issues  that LarryLindsey talked about,  although I can accept  separating them.  I dothink that  there  is  the possibility that  announcing our  actionspromptly can have  some adverse  impact  on  the  deliberative process.But  in  the current  climate  I think the benefit  of providing moreinformation to  the public  outweighs whatever that  cost  is.  Obviously,that's a difficult  measurement issue.With respect.to what should be released, and maybe Imisunderstood a little what we  discussed in  the  subcommittee,  Ipersonally would  favor releasing only a statement  with respect  to  anincreased or  decreased degree  of  pressure on reserve positions.  Ithink any statement with respect to  the impact  on short-term marketrates,  in effect,  is  something  that will be decoded.  In  other words,we will  be  using different  adjectives  to describe what we  think theeffect on money market  interest rates  is  going  to be  and then we'll bede  facto  announcing our targets.  "Small" will  mean 25 basis points;"moderate" will mean 50  basis points.  I don't  know what more than 50would mean;  that  doesn't  seem very likely!

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  The  same thing  could happen with the term"reserve restraint."  In  saying a slight  change,  the  "slight" mayequivocate--

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Tom, let  me just  say that  that's aninteresting  issue, but  that's a very major question and I would hateto  have that  decision made at  today's meeting.  I almost prefer tostay with Governor Lindsey's  suggestion and  then when we  get to  thefinal  decisions make that  judgment.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Okay.  I'm just  expressing some  views at  thispoint.  The other point  I would make  is  that  I'm not sure  I agree  withwhat Larry Lindsey was  saying.  We are  doing  something here  that,  ifit's done  well  and announced properly, will  have  a very positivepublic  effect.  Our practice  is  going  to lock us  into  that because mysense  is we won't get back  to  these  other disclosure  issues  for  somemonths, and  there may be other actions  to  announce in  the meantime.So,  our provisional  behavior is  in effect going  to  set  the precedent3/22/94-57-and lock us  into  a policy, and it will be  anti-climatic when weannounce  it.  Personally,  I think we can get much more mileage  out ofannouncing  the  fact  that  this  decision has  been made  and just  get itdone.  In  effect, we  are trading  it  away anyway,  so why not  announceit  and try  to get  some public  relations  benefit  out  of  it.  The otherthing I would say in  such  an announcement  is  that we  continue to haveour disclosure practices under  review, because  I think there  are  someother disclosure  issues  that  in due  course need to  be  reviewed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman, I'm not  against disclosure butI would repeat what  I said last  time,  which is  that we have not reallyhad an opportunity  in  this  Committee  to  discuss this  fully.  There area number  of  issues  surrounding  this disclosure matter.  Tom has  justbrought up  one  of  them;  there  are  others.  So  from a proceduralstandpoint  alone,  I think we need an opportunity to  discuss  thisfurther.  If we  announce  it  today, I think we're going  to be  lockedinto doing it.  We said the  announcement last  time wasn't  going to beprecedential.  If  we do  it  twice,  I think we  are going to  be lockedin.On more  substantive grounds,  we haven't  really  taken  intoaccount  the effect  of  this disclosure on the  discount rate,  the effecton  our  directors.  There  is  a whole host of  things  that  I think wereally need to  take  into  account  in  a more  systematic  way.  So  I wouldbe strongly opposed to  doing anything today.  I think we ought  torevert  to  our normal practice of  not disclosing our decision and letthe  markets pick  this up and then deal  as  soon as  we  can with thisissue  together with the other disclosure issues,  as  Governor Lindseyhas  indicated.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I have a very strong preference  tomake an announcement  in some  form.  On  this particular afternoon,whether  it's  the  Chairman or whether  it's  the Committee  making theannouncement has  mainly the  significance that  if  the  Chairman does  it,it doesn't  lock  the Committee  into having made  a decision to do  it.So  I think that actually has some  merit.  I have long  had what ErniePatrikis  after consultation with Virgil Mattingly assures  me  is  not  alegal  concern but an ethical  concern;  and that  is,  if we  go  into  thesignificant policy move by our  operations  in the  open market,  the proswith whom we deal  know it before  anybody else does.  It may be  aminute or  two before, but  that gives  them a market  advantage, which  Idon't  like.  To me it's  an ethical matter, which I take  quiteseriously.  That  doesn't mean--unlike  in  the  case of  the chairman of awell  known committee--that my ethics  are necessarily the  law ofnature.  But  that's  where  I come down  on the  issue.  I would preferthat we  announce  our decision and I think it's  probably better  on  thisoccasion if  the Chairman does  it  rather  than  the  Committee.3/22/94-58-

MR. MCTEER.  One  of  the benefits  of  an  immediate  announcementis  that  it  eliminates  any perception of  leaks,  so  I would suggest  thatwe always  do  it  at  the end of  the meeting rather  than have  a hiatus.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I would favor  announcing  it now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  I'm very much in  favor of  announcing it.  Whetherit's  an announcement  from the  Chairman or  the Committee  I think  isimmaterial.  If  we do  it  today, which  I think we  should, we will  haveestablished a precedent and we will  have to  continue.  But  I thinkit's  a constructive change.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, I think we  should announce it  onthe merits  of  the  case.  The  time  is  here  to  do that.  As  far as  todayis  concerned, I would be uncomfortable holding this  decision overnightand letting  it  be  announced in  the traditional way of  Desk actiontomorrow.  I think  that would be  a mistake.  I am in  favor  of  lettingit  be your  announcement rather  than the  Committee's for  the reasonsthat  Governor Lindsey  and President McDonough discussed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I agree with what Governor Kelley just  said.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.3/22/94-59-

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I support  the  subcommittee's recommendation.  Ithink we  have in a  sense committed  ourselves  to  this and  I think BillMcDonough's point  is  well  taken.  We should get decisions  out  to  theannouncing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I would favor  the  announcement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Well,  this  was a very wise  subcommittee and Iwant  to  concur with its  recommendations.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Who is  the chairman of  thatsubcommittee?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  The  chairman departed the  scene!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  that  everybody?  Jerry, you  said yesto announcing.  Is  that  right?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Can  I ask:  Is  there  an  auction today?  Are wetalking about  announcing today?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  There was;  it's  over.

[SECTION]

MS. LOVETT.  It's  over.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  The  auction  is  over.  Okay,  I'd  announce.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  That's part  of  the  timing  issue--toget  it  out  after  the  auctions  are over.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Ms. Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I must  say I  am impressed by PresidentForrestal's  comments.  I would like  to  see the  disclosure  decisions  asa package and I would not like  to  see  us  committed to  announcing everytime.  But  in general  I think announcement  is  not a bad thing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well,  let  me make  the  following request.I don't  deny that  it will  appear precedential.  In  fact,  I think  it'snaive to  believe that  if  we  announce  today that  it's not going to  comeout  that  way.  We  do have a marginal  value  in my  doing it  and thenmaking  it  official  at  the  time we  do  everything else.  It's  not  thatit's  a big deal,  but  it's  a bigger package  to  announce and  it  probablyis  wise  to  do  that.  Unless  there  is  strong objection, that's  what  Ithink  I'd like  to  do.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I don't  have  a  strong objection, Alan.  Howwould Joe  Coyne respond to  inquiries of  "What does  this  mean?"  Thereare bound to  be  some requests;  what's  the answer?3/22/94 -60-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  He would basically say  the Committeeitself  has not  come  to  a  final  conclusion.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  It  is  still  considering disclosure  issues?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  will be part of  a broader package.Okay our next meeting  is--

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  May 17th.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  May the  17th;  this  really  is  a  longintermeeting period.
