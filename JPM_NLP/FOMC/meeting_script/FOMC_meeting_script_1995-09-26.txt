CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody like  to move  approval  ofthe  minutes?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So move.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Mr.  Fisher, please.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  Before permitting myself  to  takeadvantage  of  the  new high-tech toys  in  the  ceiling and because  of  thenumber  of  topics  I need to  cover,  I thought  I would try to  exhaust thepotential  of  older  technologies.  Thus,  you should  find an  outline ofmy remarks  on  the  table  in  front  of  you together with  a single page ofcolored charts.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  There  seems  to  be  a lot  of  movement into Swissfrancs, particularly by  the Germans.  Is  there  a general search  inEurope  for--I  hate  to  use  the words--a  "safe haven,"  or what  is  it?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.  Beginning  in the  spring and  continuingover  the  summer, the German banking community seemed to  awake to  thepossibility of  capturing some  of  the  flows  by placing  them in  Swissinvestments.  This  coincided with  some  revelations  about the  use  ofLuxembourg accounts by Germans  for  tax avoidance.  So,  there was  adouble incentive  for  the German  investment  community to  move out  ofLuxembourg and find some  other place.  German banks  in Switzerland,not  just  Swiss  banks,  seem  to  have  taken advantage  of  this opportunityinitially  through mark Eurodeposits  in  Switzerland but  funds  clearlyalso were moved into  Swiss  assets  for  "safe haven"  reasons as  well.There has been much talk  in Germany about how far  out  the  yield curveinvestors  can afford to  go,  given  the uncertainties  about  futurereturns.  That  has been part  of  the marketing pitch the  bankers haveused to  stimulate this  flow.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Are  they actually going to  their  localDeutschebank to buy Swiss  franc money market  funds  or whatever itmight be?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  precisely things  like  that.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  There have been long  articles  in various  Germannewspapers  about  the advantages  of  this kind of  operation--newspaperssuch as  the  Frankfurter Allegemeine  Zeitung  and the  SuddendeutscheZeitung.  The  Swiss  are understandably somewhat unhappy  since they  arejust  sitting  there  like  any other  emerging market,  if  I may put  itthat way.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I failed to  mention  that the  Swiss  lowered  theirrates  and  saw their  currency keep appreciating last week.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  How long have  they been reducing  their rates?9/26/95rate.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  They are down  to  2 percent  on  their discount

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Would  the kinds  of  operational  changes  thatyou are  contemplating, or working  on, require  legislativeauthorizations?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  In the  implicit  division of  labor between DonKohn and myself,  I am working  on  issues  that would not  involvelegislative  changes.  There  are questions  about possible changes  inreserve  requirements  that might involve  new legislation,  and Don maybe better placed  to  talk about  those.  At  the  Desk, we are  looking atsome very simple  issues  such  as:  what  time  of day we  can  operate;what  level  of  information we  have to  operate with at  different  timesof  the day;  whether  there is  a different  type  of  repo with which wemight be  able  to conduct  operations  in  the market  late  in  the  day;  andwhether we  could change  the  discount window in  some  informal  way, orperhaps  some  statutory way.  Reserve  requirement  changes would beanother  approach.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  If  the Board wanted to  go  to  a system of  low,broadly based reserve  requirements,  that  would require  legislativechanges.  It  is  one of  the options  we are  looking at.  Obviously, ifyou wanted  to  pay interest  on  reserves,  that would  require  legislativechanges.  It  may be  a little  late  for  that.  Legislative  changes alsowould be  required  for  a system under which  the  Federal  Reserve mightpay  a low interest  rate on  excess  reserves to put  a floor on  thefederal  funds  rate  and impose a Lombard  rate  or  something  like  that  toprovide a ceiling.  We are beginning to  look at  a broad range ofalternatives.  I think the  issue has  caught up with us  a little  fasterthan we thought  it  was  going to  a month  or  two  ago.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Do you  think that  the  kinds of  changes  thatyou  are looking  at would reduce  the  propensity of  banks to  developsweep arrangements,  or do  you think  those  are with  us  anyway and haveto  be factored  in?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  At  this point I tend toward  the  latter view.  Ifwe were able  to pay a market  rate  of  interest on  reserves,  that wouldremove  the  incentive  for  sweeps.  In  that  event,  the  current  sweeparrangements  might be undone,  but  it  would be very hard to  get  thelegislative  authority in the  current  budget  environment.  The otherapproaches we  are  looking at  would not  remove  the  reserve requirementtax or  the  incentive  to reduce  required reserves.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I have  one other question.  What  is  happeningin  the markets  that  is  affecting the  timing of  operations?  Are  thingsshifting to  other markets,  to  overseas  markets?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No.  If  the  dealer  community does more of  itsfinancing early in  the  day,  they generally have  fewer securities  leftto  finance by the time  we would normally enter  the market  at  11:30a.m.  It  is  a very mechanical  issue.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  So  it  is  still domestic.9/26/95

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It  is  just  the domestic  players  and they  arejust  completing  their  financing.  Certainty  is better  for  someonelooking to  finance  a large portfolio  than uncertainty, and waiting  tofind out whether or  not we will  enter  the market  has  its  risks  forthem.  It  is  not a major issue.  On Monday of  last week we receivedonly  $5.7  billion  of propositions.  The  next day we were  looking at  aneed between  $8 and $10  billion at  the  time we made  the  decision.  Wedid end up  injecting about  $8 billion,  after getting about  $10  billionin propositions as  a result  of operating earlier.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I have a different  response  from the  one  Dongave  to  Susan's  question about  incentives  for  innovation.  As  long  aswe maintain a distinction between liabilities that  are called depositsand liabilities  that are not  called deposits,  there  are going  to beincentives.  If  we had a low, broad-based reserve ratio  on allnoncapital  liabilities without  the  distinction between deposit  andnondeposit  liabilities,  then  that  incentive would go  away.  So,  itdepends  on how we do  it.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Yes.  I suspect  this  is  going to  take  somemajor  fleshing out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any other questions?  If not,  wouldsomebody like to  move ratification of  the  domestic Desk operations?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So move.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Shall we move  on?Let's go  to  Messrs.  Prell and Truman.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  [Statement-see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  either gentleman?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike, you  referred to  what  is  happening  to  laborcosts.  If you look  at what models seem  to  tell you about what  ishappening  there,  in  the last  three  quarters,  at  least  in  terms  of  themodel  that we look  at,  inflation  in  the  employment cost  index  has beenlower  than predicted by 3/4  percentage point.  My impression  is  thatthat may be related  to developments  in medical  costs,  and it  ispossible that  the  effect will be of  short  duration.  When you  look outover  the next  two years,  what  assumptions do you make  about what  willhappen  to  the ECI?  Have we  seen an  intercept change or  are  we goingto  see  an  error decay?  What  assumptions have you made?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think your characterization of  a favorablesurprise relative  to  many typical  models  is  right.  When we  getsurprises, we go back  and start  tinkering with models.  We want to  seewhether we  can fit  history better and whether we can,  for  example,introduce  something into  these  equations  such as  lagged wages  that9/26/95might  capture  a trend  in wages  or  a wage norm and reduce  the  errorssignificantly.  I don't know whether that  is particularly  appealing onanalytical  grounds,  but  there  is  a sense  that we  are locked  into  sometrend here.  People  seem to  have a 3 percent  figure  in mind about wageincreases.  If  we  looked at wages  alone  and  tried to model  those, wewould probably also  see  some  surprise there  in terms  of  how low  theinflation has been.  But we  do  think  that  the  overall  compensationnumber  is  more relevant over  time,  and we  have seen the  downwardmovement  in medical  costs as  constituting  something of  a favorablesupply shock  in  a sense to  the  system.There  are significant  changes  going on  in  the medical  caresurprised year after year by how fast  the  costs  of  their medicalbenefits were  rising and they did not necessarily subtract those  costsfrom workers' wages, we  are getting a reversal  of  that  now that  thereis  some  revolution in  the market  for medical  services.  Business firmshave not passed the  benefits  of  reduced medical  cost  increases  throughto workers  on  the wage  side  or  in  other benefits.  As  we  see  it,  thisprocess  is  likely to  continue but with diminishing quantitativeimportance  as we go  forward.  A  lot  of  firms  have made  the  shift  tomanaged care  systems.  Medical  care inflation  itself  seems  to bestabilizing.  There  are  some risks,  as we noted  in passing in  theGreenbook, that  if  some  of  the  reforms  that  are being proposed forMedicare and other programs are  adopted, there  could be more costshifting to  insurance providers.  So, we  think  that  this  run may be atits  end, but  we just don't  see  anything emerging now  that  looks  like  asubstantial  acceleration.  Many of  the  Reserve Banks  have  reported intheir  letters  on  the discount  rate and in  the  Beigebook that  there  aresigns  of  tightness here and there  and that  employers  are respondingwith higher wages.  But one  also has a sense  that  there are  pockets ofweakness  and that many employers  are  looking  to other means  besidesraising compensation  to  solve their  labor problems.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  So,  the  inflation assumptions, which  are reallyquite  reasonably optimistic,  presume  that  things  are moving back tonormal.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I think we will remain below most modelforecasts, but  we have projected a little  acceleration in  the  growthof  compensation costs  as we  go  through  the  next  few quarters.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  A very slow decay in  the  forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Very slow.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mike, I also have  a couple of  questions aboutlabor markets--along somewhat  the same  lines.  One  of  the persistentstories  that  we have heard all  year  from large and small businesses,more  so  in what  are described as  tight  labor markets  than  in marketsthat  are not  described that way,  is  how much businesses  are spendingfor  training.  Businesses  tend to  respond  to perceived conditions bybeing willing  to  spend more on  in-firm training programs whose  cost  aswe  all know is  expensed;  it  doesn't add to  capital  stock.  There are9/26/95two motivations.  One,  of  course,  is  the use  of  new technologies  thatresult  in  the need  for related  skills.  The second is  that businessesdo  not respond to  the need  for  low-skilled  and unskilled workers bybidding wages  up  in  an effort  to  get  the  workers  they want,  but by ina sense saying  they  are not  going to pay more but will  hire people  andtrain them.  How does  the  staff  think about that  kind of businessresponse  in  its  analysis  of  potential  output, productivity, the  NAIRU,Second,  the  staff  responds  to  questions  aboutthose sorts  of  things? subdued wage behavior by referring to  the  notion of  job insecurity.Is  there  any direct evidence of  a shift  in  some variable in  a laborsupply function called  "worker insecurity?"

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  On the  first  question,  if  this emphasis  ontraining  is  a manifestation  of poor quality of  the  labor  force,  thenthat presumably has  some implication  for potential  output.  In  termsof  the  growth of  the  labor  force,  the  effective  growth is  less  than itwould appear.  That  tendency can be  made up for by  investing  toimprove the  quality of  the  labor force.  Training presumably  is  a costthat would perhaps be  an element  in  some markup  over perceived unitlabor costs  if  it  doesn't  show up  as a form  of  compensation.On  the NAIRU, I suppose  it's possible that  this  deteriorationin  the  quality of  the  labor force,  if  that's  what  it  is,  could  lead toa greater  tendency toward mismatches  in  the  labor market  and someelevation  of  the NAIRU.  But  I don't  think we have any  sense  thatthere  has been a radical  change in  this.  Employers  have beencomplaining about the  quality of workers  for  a good many years.  Idon't know that what you describe  is  an  entirely differentcircumstance, but maybe the  response  is  different.  I alluded to  thiswhen  I was  replying to  President  Parry.  We do hear  these reports,  andit  does  seem  that  there  is  this  alternative  response of  taking a lessqualified worker and making that  investment  in training rather thanbidding for  the scarce pool  of  well-qualified workers.On  the job  insecurity question,  I don't  think  there  are  anydirect measures.  There may be  some opinion polls  of which  I'm notaware  that might have  asked people how they felt  about this.  One canlook at  some  indicators,  such  as  perceptions  of  job availability  inthe Conference Board survey, and relate that  to  actual  unemploymentand other  labor market  indicators  to  see  if  things  are out of  kilter.My recollection is  that  the number  of people  saying that jobs  are  inscarce  supply is  probably a little high relative  to  what one mighthave  expected.  We have  tinkered with the  question of  whether there  isa systematic  influence by, for  example,  putting variables  into  aPhillips  curve relation and  so  on.  My sense  is  that  we  haven't  comeup with  anything that  is  very persuasive.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We've  attempted to  use  other measures  of  laborwanted index,  and a variety of  other  things  that do  tend to  showreadings  that would suggest  somewhat more  slack in  the  labor marketsrelative to  the unemployment  rate.  But none of  those performed anybetter  or  any differently  than does  the  unemployment  rate.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think one can make an  inference from  otherexpressions  of  dissatisfaction with the  current  situation  in  theeconomy and just anecdotal  evidence from  the  press and so  on  thatpeople probably feel  that  they don't have  a lock  on  their jobs,  even9/26/95-6-in  a well-established  corporation, the  way they  once  did.  There  is  asense  that because  of  changing technology the  loss  of  a job will  incurthe  risk  that  the next  job will pay a much lower wage  than  the  currentjob and  lower  than might have been expected in prior years.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You might have  the  staff recalculate theaverage  age  of  the  capital  stock as  a potential  technology variablejust  to  try to  capture  this  sort  of  thing.  I don't know what  theresult will  look  like.  I suspect  it  won't work,  like most otherthings!  In any event,  the  anecdotal  evidence  that  is  emerging  at  thisstage does  suggest  that  there  is  an  insecurity issue  and  that  itindeed has  had a structural  effect as  President  Jordan points  out.That has  to be  the  case  if  you consider that  the workforce  interfaceswith the  capital  stock to  produce  goods  and services.  If  the  capitalstock  is  turning over  increasingly rapidly, meaning  that  the  capitalstock itself  feels  more  insecure,  [Laughter]  it  is  reasonable  topresume  that  the people  who work with that  insecure capital  stock haveto  feel  somewhat insecure  about  their  jobs.  The  issue  is  how tomeasure  it.  In doing so,  we have  to be  careful  to  put  the jobinsecurity concept  in its  proper context.  It  is  to  a certain  extent  alevel-adjustment  issue  because  one  can  imagine what  a normalized wagelevel might be under  the  standard Phillips  curve or  other wageequation model excluding  the  insecurity  issue.  What  one would get  isan  upward  trend.  If  we add  in an  insecurity variable,  and insecurityat  its  maximum, the  level would be uniformly lower.  One  must presumethat as  we move  from  the normal  level  down  to  the other  level,  therecomes a point  even at maximum  insecurity where  the wage  level becomesa relevant concept,  and if  we are  looking  at  the  rate  of  change,  thenthe  insecurity has  to  have a diminishing effect.  Job insecurity hasbeen around  for  a long time  at  this  stage,  and it  almost  surely hashad the  effect of  moving  the  level  down  from normal.  We may soon berunning into  resistance  to  downsizing.  At  that point we will  be backon the  same growth  rate pattern  even though the  level  may beappreciably lower.  This  issue may be relevant  in  judging the pricelevel,  but  after the one-time adjustment,  it  ceases  to  become an  issuewith respect  to  inflation  as  best  I can  see.  Anyway, I'll  takeanother look  at  that.I just  got  the  results  on the  average  age of  the  capitalstock, which  I think may be  used as  a proxy for  technology insecurity,and we will  see  if we  even get  the  right  sign.  We know it  has  theright trend;  it's  just a question of  whether  it  picks up  anything inaddition.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Mr. Chairman,  I think you've made  a very goodpoint about  these  levels and changes.  It  certainly  would be apossibility that  as unemployment remains  in a relatively low  zone,though  the  average duration is  remaining  relatively long, people wouldbecome a little  less  concerned about  their potential  vulnerability sothat  that could alter  the--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That would be  even more  extreme.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Exactly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'm just  stipulating  that  they remainjust  as  insecure.9/26/95

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Yes.  Your point's  well  taken.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  a decaying factor  on  the wage  ratechange.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Ted, would you elaborate  a bit  on  the Daiwasituation and whether  that's known  in  the market?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They announced  today, Japanese  time,  that  thehead of  their New York  office had been making  false  trades  for  11years, which  is  hard  to  believe, and had lost roughly  $1 billion inthe  process.  They will  take  that  loss  in their  fiscal  half-yearresults.  The news was  released early  enough to  be  in The WashingtonPost.  You may not  have seen  The Washington  Post.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I heard something about  it  on  the news  thismorning, but  I didn't see  any details.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Peter or  someone else may have  some moredetails.  They called me  last night.  The  announcement apparently didnot  affect  their markets.  The Nikkei,  for example,  was up  300  pointsin  Tokyo today.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  What were they  trading  in?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  claim is  that  this high official  of  Daiwa'sNew York branch had been trading  in U.S.  bills  and bonds  in thestraight bill  and bond markets.  He managed to  lose between $1 and$1.5  billion  over  the  last  11  years;  that  is  the amount  that isunaccounted  for.  It's  a rather extraordinary tale.  The  relevantauthorities  in New York are  looking into  the  matter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You would think  there would be  enoughderivative hedges  to secure  the position.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Maybe I could expand on  this  alittle, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  He was  dealing in cash  governmentsecurities  and making up  the  losses  by taking  securities  out  of  thecustody  account.  He was  in charge  of  the  custody section of  the  Daiwabranch  in New York  and also  was allowed  to  trade  in governmentsecurities.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  They  are a primary dealer,  Bill?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Yes.  His  confession, which waswritten  in mid-July when he paid a visit  to Japan,  indicates  that hefalsified the  records, managed  to  set  up a separate  clearing accounton  his  trading as  compared with  that  of  others,  and suffered capitallosses of  about  $850  million and  losses  of  about another  $250 millionin  interest  that  is  now owed to  the people who actually have rightfulownership  of  the  securities  that he  sold over  these many years.  Thefacts  are going to  demand  a good deal  of  time by our  examiners and  theU.S.  Attorney.  As  Ted suggested,  the  tale  as we  know it  as  of  now hascertain apocryphal  characteristics  that  I think are  going  to demand  a9/26/95good deal  of  looking  into.  One of  our principal  concerns  is  that heconfessed to  the  authorities  of  his  bank in Japan in  the  middle  ofBank,  the MOF  and BOJ were  not  informed until  Monday of  last  week.  Asall  of  you would immediately agree, we  do not  take kindly  to  themanagement of  a bank that  has  this  information  and doesn't  share  itwith regulators  for  two months.  I think our kindness  toward the  DaiwaBank will be  somewhat  less  thanhappy to  hear that  the  president and the chairman are  going to  take  a30  percent salary cut  for  six months.You will be

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Does  their  chairman earn  several billion  a year?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  any  evidence of  a motive?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  No.  The  confession  is  reallyextraordinary.  It  would  lend itself  to  a great  soap  opera.  Hesuffered losses  that were  small  initially.  He wanted  to hide  thembecause of  the  disgrace that  it  would bring to  the  bank.  The pressurewas  so  great  that  he went  through  a divorce.  The  confession impliesthat  he made  a mistake  and  that he  got  in deeper  and deeper  anddeeper.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why did he  start  in  the  first place?What was  his  motive  originally?  Was  it  personal?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  No.  The  confession does not  lenditself  to an  interpretation  of personal greed.  Obviously,  that's  oneof  the  things we  have  to  look  into.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  any evidence  in  the  way it  wasstructured that he  would be  able  to  draw funds  for  his  own account?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  He  certainly was  in  a position todo  so because he was  in effect  running a separate bank that nobody,according to  the  confession, but himself  knew about.  Therefore, hecertainly was  in a position to  siphon off  funds  for  his  own benefitvery easily.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why do  we assume  that  this  was not  theobvious motive, and why are we  looking beyond  that?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  At  this stage,  we're  assuming thatthat  could be the  motive;  we're assuming that  he  could haveaccomplices;  we're assuming all  kinds  of  things  over and above thatwhich  this  confession would lead one  to believe.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Supposing  that were  a motive, andobviously we  don't  know, and say hypothetically that  he had succeededand replenished  all  the  relevant  funds  and the  like, would there beany  supervisory mechanism to  detect  that?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  The  answer  is,  I don't  think  sobut--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would  conclude that we have  noevidence  that  there may not  have been  other significant  successful9/26/95endeavors by people  throughout history that  were  never uncovered.  Myown judgment  is  that  there  is  a limit  to what  the most  assiduous bankexaminer can do  in  a situation where  somebody engages  in  a practice  inwhich he  trades  for his  own account,  wins,  replenishes,  and we neverhear of  him.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I think the  ability  of  somebody  whowas as  successful  as  this  guy was  at  fraud--a  lot  more  successful  thanhe appears  to  have been as  a securities  trader--

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  His  teacher was  an accountant!

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  According to  the  confession,  hemanaged  to  lose money whichever way the market went.  [Laughter]  Ithink  that a very successful  dealer/operator  of  a fraud could go  onfor  a very extended period of  time and never be  caught.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  That's why separation of  duties  is  soimportant.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Exactly, and  I think that  is  all  themore reason why we  have  to  be  very assiduous  in  our evaluation  ofinternal  auditing processes  and of  apparent  internal  conflicts  ofinterest built  into  the  system.  Unless we  can do that,  I don't knowwhat we can  do.  Even with  that,  somebody  is  always clever enough  tofigure  a way around it.  It's  a constant ploy.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  In  three  examinations  that weredone  by the  New York Bank on  the  Daiwa branch,  the  constant theme wasthat  the  audit  controls were not  adequate.  We actually got  them  toimprove the  audit  controls  very considerably.  Just  an  interestinganecdote:  They had  two  locations,  one in  the World Trade  Center andone  in Rockefeller  Center.  According  to  their  permissions  from boththe MOF and  the State  Banking  Superintendent of  New York, they weresupposed to  be  doing the  government  securities  trading only from  themidtown branch.  Mr.  Iguchi,  the culprit,  was  at  the  downtown branch.When we  did the  inspection  in  1992,  they took  all  the  dealers  from  thedowntown branch to  the midtown branch,  turned out  all  the  lights  inthe  downtown trading room, put  a bunch of  boxes  in  it,  and told  ourexaminers  that  it was  a storeroom.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's nice.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  It's  a little difficult  to  believethat  nobody had a clue  as  to what  this guy was  up to  when  that  sort ofthing was  going on.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I was  going to  raise  a question about  jobsecurity, but  I'm not  sure  it's  appropriate.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We know one person whose job securityis--.  Has  he been  fired?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  He  has been  fired  as  of  the  25th ofreasonably certain he  is  in  the  hands of  the  U.S.  Attorney.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  If  I'm not  mistaken, the  duration,  or  theamount  of  long-term unemployment,  is  high at  current  unemploymentrates.  This  has  to  mean by the  laws of  arithmetic  that  the  amount  ofturnover and of  short-duration unemployment  are low.  I guess my firstthought would have  been that  job  insecurity comes  from  turnover;  youworry about  losing your job.  Isn't  that right?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  You  can get  it  back.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes,  that's  right.  I said  that was my  firstthought.  Maybe  it's wrong.  Maybe  it's  duration.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  if  I feel  insecure,  I'm not  going toleave.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Moreover,  for  any given amount of  unemployment,if  it  were disproportionately short  term it  would suggest  that peoplewere able  to  find  jobs relatively quickly.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  It's  disproportionately long.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  But when there's a lot  of  long-term unemployment,that would suggest  there may be  some  difficulty for  people who  havebeen displaced,  for  example, with all  the restructuring.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The  separation rate  and the  rehire  rate arerelatively low,  right?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  correct.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes.  Certainly,  the hypothesis  for years wasthat  the separation  rate matters most.  Firing was the  key thing  injob security.  That may have  been wrong.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  that was  the  leading hypothesis  for along  time.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  We don't  know the  facts.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Right.  It  was an  economy move by  the BLS  tostop  collecting those data.  Now, they are going to  economize more,too!9/26/95-11-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That was  a long  time  ago.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  1981.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The  other question was  for Ted.  Should we bereading recent  events  as  an  escalation of  the  anti-EMU  campaign?  Thisis  a two-part  question.  Should we  expect  that  to  continue  to  weighagainst the  dollar?  There  seems  to  be no  inherent reason why thatshould be  anti-dollar, but  in practice  it  always  seems  to  weigh on  thedollar.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Peter has  some  comments.  Let me give  you mine.What  I tried  to  suggest  in my briefing is  that  this  is  a process  thatis  going to  go  on  for  years.  It's  going to  be up  and down and up anddown.  As  different  countries and  institutions within  the  countriesjockey for position,  there will  be,  I think,  a heightening  of  thedebate about  the  EMU and whether  individual  countries  are  ready forit.  You  saw,  for  example, how Mr. Arthuis  got beat  up on  Thursday byMr. Waigel who  came  out at  Majorca  and said that maybe we  just  oughtto postpone  the EMU  for  a couple  of  years.  Now, that's  notnecessarily anti-EMU, but  it  changes the  whole timetable.  The debateis  heightened as  the  time  for various kinds  of decisions  comes  closer.The  effect  on  the dollar,  it  seems  to  me,  is  largely secondary.  Itpartly depends  on what you mean by  the  dollar.  The dollar  tends  toweaken  relative  to  the  deutschemark  the  less  likely the  EMU  appears  tobe  and  therefore  the more  likely the deutschemark will  be  free  to  riserelative  to  the  dollar.  Then,  the  ebb and  flow of  discussion doestend  to  affect  the  dollar:  The way I think of  it  is  that  for peoplewho have  liquid assets  it  is  easier  to  get out  of  dollars  intodeutschemarks  to  cover positions  than  to  get out  of  Swedish kronorsinto deutschemarks.  So, you  have  a backwash effect  on  the  dollar, atleast  in the  short  run.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I'll  just  insert  there:  A number of  the  Europeancountries continue  to prefer  to  hold a relatively large portion oftheir reserves  in  dollars  for  investment purposes.  But  in a crisis,they want  to  convert  those into marks  to  be  able  to  defend their owncurrency.  There  are  two  effects on  the  market  that  in  the very shortrun can create this  sort  of  disturbance.  Even  the expectation  of  itcan create  the  disturbance.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  shouldn't  affect  the  level  of  thedollar in  the  long run.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No,  it  shouldn't.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You have  the  accumulation of  thosedollars  to begin with.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.  I'm referring  to  a very short-run effect.Countries have a tendency  to hold  large  quantities  of  dollars and  thenconvert  them into marks to  defend their own  currency.  They also havea preference  for  acquiring  reserves  that way.  Even  if  their ultimategoal  is  to  acquire marks,  they will  try  to move  into  the dollar out  oftheir own currency and  then  into marks  in  the  event  of a crisis.  Theother very short-run phenomenon, which  certainly hurt us  last week,occurs when  the  situation  that  Ted was  referring  to becomes  acute.  AsEurope  closes up for  business and  investors are  looking  to  defend9/26/95-12-themselves,  then  they  really have  to  go  into  the  dollar/mark becausethey  simply can't  get  liquidity  in  the  Paris/mark or  the  peseta/markin  the  New York  trading day after  Europe has  gone  home.  This  thentends  to  accelerate the  movement  in dollar/marks  in  the  very shortrun.  It's  very  short run but  it's  very pronounced.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  concern that  the  dramatic  shiftin  funds  that  has been going on  in recent weeks  could erode Germanpolitical  support  for  the  EMU to  a point where  it  would be difficult,if  not  impossible,  to  implement  the  EMU on  schedule?  I am referringto  the  shift  from deutschemarks by  German  investors  into  Swiss  francsthat has  been showing up,  I gather,  in  falling  sales by German lifeinsurance  companies.  We are  getting moves  out of  Luxembourg accountsinto  Swiss  franc  accounts  in  Switzerland.  I guess  two-thirds  of  thepeople  surveyed are against  eliminating  the  deutschemark  in Germany.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It's  certainly  a possibility.  How big it  is,  Idon't  know.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think the  support  of  the  Chancellor  for  theprocess  is  really  the only  thing standing in  the way of  the deluge  ofpublic  opposition.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  He  took  a position as  I read  it  thatdidn't  say what he  said;  or  if  he  said  it,  he didn't mean it;  and ifhe  meant it,  he  shouldn't  have.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  All  of  the  above!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  This  is  a question on  a different  subjectentirely, the  fiscal  situation.  Going out  to  1997,  Mike,  I noticedthat  the  Greenbook forecast  showed real  GDP  growing at  2 percent  in1997.  The reduction  in government purchases  seemed to  have  a bigimpact  on  GDP going out that  far.  I really have  three questions:  Isthis viewed as  a permanent  change?  What  assumption are you makingabout  the  steady rate  of  GDP  growth under that  type  of  fiscalscenario?  Do you  see any  offsetting private-sector spending tocompensate for  this  reduction in  federal purchases  during  this period?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think it  ultimately depends  on what  monetarypolicy you pursue.  In  essence, given our  assumption of  little changein  the  federal  funds  rate--we have  just a little ticking  down  at  theend of  next year--we don't  see  here an  aggressive effort  to offset  theongoing fiscal  restraint.  We have  specified  a three-year  reduction,but  the presumption would be  that Congress  is  going to pass  somethingthat  goes  even beyond that.  So,  fiscal  restraint  would be an  ongoingforce  in  the  economy, though diminishing.  As  we have  it,  the biggestdegree of  fiscal  restraint  is  imposed  in 1996.  Some  of  the restraintthat  flows  from earlier actions--over  1993,  for  example--disappearsand the  smaller  increments  from our  assumed new fiscal package  arewhat  is  left.  So,  on our  assumption,  the  degree of  fiscal  restraintreally is  diminishing a bit  as  we move  out  in  time.  We  felt  that,  (1)we wanted to  stick to  the  steady policy assumption  for  the baseline,and  (2) this produced in our  analysis an  outcome  where resourceutilization rates  eased only moderately  and created a situation in1997  where  there was  only a small  degree of  slack in  the  system.9/26/95-13-Given the  enunciated goal  of  moving  toward price  stability, thatseemed  to be  reasonable  to  present  to  you.  As  you move  on  out,  unlessyou wanted  to  accelerate  the  progress  toward price stability, if  thetendency was  for  that  gap  to  remain and  for  the  unemployment  rate  tocontinue drifting  up, you might want  to  pursue a somewhat morestimulative  policy for  a time  to  at  least  stabilize  things  at acomfortable  level  of  resource utilization.  It's  a question in  thismechanical  fashion of just  how fast  you want  to  move  toward pricestability.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  But  if  you kept  monetary policy  steady at  itscurrent  level  during this  period, is  there  a wealth  effect  that wouldincrease  private-sector spending to  compensate  for  any of  thisreduction through lower  taxes  or anything like that?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In our  forecast we  don't anticipate  that  therewill be  any favorable wealth  effects  as  we move beyond this  year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Could I follow up  on  that  last question?Mike,  I would think  that  the  impact  on  the  economy of  any particularbudget would depend heavily on  the  degree of  substitutability betweengovernment products  and services  and private-sector products  andservices.  Have you  looked at  that  issue?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  There  are some very  obvious  questions,  forexample  in the  area of  medical  care.  We have  not  specified  ourpackage  in a way that  calls  for  staking out  any position on  this.  Butit's  quite  conceivable that people  of  reasonable means,  if  they werecalled on  to  pay a larger Medicare premium or  to  have some  deductibleor  something, might continue  to consume  roughly  the  same  amount ofmedical  care  and save  less  in  the  short  run.  As  I suggested, thepackage being discussed now includes  lots  of changes  in programs  thatare  very fundamental--for example,  the  welfare program.  There  arepotential  labor supply responses  that we will  have  to  come  to  gripswith.  If  legislation is  enacted in  the  next  few weeks, we may not beable  to put  that  off  for  very long in  our analysis  for  the  forecast.I don't  think it's  going  to  be  a big deal  over  the next  couple  ofyears  even if  there  is  a phasing in  and so  on.  But  over  the  longerhaul,  there  could be  effects on saving behavior;  there  could beeffects  on  labor  supply behavior and maybe  many other  effects.  We'llhave to  look very carefully at what  are pretty radical changes  thatare being discussed  in some  of  these programs.  Regarding  the  transferof programs  to  states  and the  block grants, we  have  assumed that  therewill be some  short-run  cushioning  for  states  and  localities  in  caseswhere there  were cutbacks  in  funding  to  absorb some  of  those  cutbacksand maintain benefit  levels.  But  over  time that would change,  too.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  Would  somebody like  to  start ourroundtable discussion?  President Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  I reported lasttime,  the  economy of  the  Sixth  District  is  generally quite healthy.Activity is  continuing  to move  along the  path of  moderate  expansionand moderate inflation.  Retailers  are reasonably optimistic.  Tourismcontinues  to  be  a stimulative  in the  economy, and  construction isimproving.  One  of  the weak spots,  if  I can call  it  that,  is9/26/95-14-manufacturing activity, which has  been a bit  sluggish.  I had notthought  about  this,  but maybe  it's because  of  the  insecurity of  thecapital  stock!  [Laughter]Looking at  the  individual  areas  very briefly, reports  fromretailers  around  the region parallel  the  discussion  that's  in  theGreenbook.  Most  saw very, very good  if  not  excellent  back-to-schoolsales.  Demand  for home-related products  continues  to  improve  alongwith home  sales.  Several merchants  did note  that  their  inventoriesare  a bit heavy, but  they do  expect very good holiday sales,  and theythink such  sales  will  bring  them back to  more  comfortable  inventorylevels.  Sales  of  1995  automobiles  from  inventories  are  coming at  theexpense  of  dealer profits and manufacturers'  incentives.  On  thetravel  side,  tourism actually is  stronger than  it was  at  this  timelast  year even  though Florida, particularly  south Florida,  saw a dropin  the  latter part  of  August due  to  tropical  storms  and hurricanes.But  that  seems  to  be  a very temporary  thing.  Foreign travel  continuesto  be  strong.  The  only disappointing area here,  and I was  a bitsurprised to  find  this,  is  that  the cruise  industry has  very soft  *bookings,  and  they are  now offering discounts;  20  percent  discountsseem to  be  typical.  So,  the  improvement  in  tourism  is  not  extendingto  ships.Our manufacturing  survey, as  I indicated,  showed  somesoftness  in August,  and  factories  remain very, very cautious  abouthiring.  There has been  little  change  in the  outlook for  capitalspending  and expansion  continues  as  the District  benefits  fromrelocations and  diversions of production  from other  domestic  sites.In  the  energy  sector,  the  rig count  in  Louisiana  in July was  at  itshighest  level  in  over  four years.  Single-family sales  improved lastmonth, although they were below  the  very strong levels  of a yearearlier.  Retailers  are quite  optimistic,  and  they  cite  favorablemortgage rates and healthy job growth.  The multifamily sector  in ourDistrict  is  quite  strong, and  I think  that's  in  contrast to  the  restof  the nation.  Commercial real  estate markets also  are  continuing  tostrengthen throughout  the  region,  and we are  seeing  some  speculativeoffice and industrial  projects  either under construction  or  in  theplanning stage.  It's  interesting  that  bankers are  now becoming muchmore  cautious about  financing  these activities,  which I guess  is  goodnews.  Bank lending  remains mixed with  the strength being  in  thebusiness area.  Wage  increases  remain  stable,  and the reports  ofshortages  of  labor are becoming  less  frequent  than  they were  even sixmonths  ago.  Prices  for  finished products were  flat  in August,although prices  of materials  in many  industries  did post  someincreases.  The general  information we  are getting  from businesspeople  is  that  it  is  still  very, very difficult  to pass  along priceincreases.  So  the  situation  in  the  District continues  to  look good.On  the national  economy, we  have not  changed our  forecastsignificantly  since the  last FOMC meeting.  However, we didincorporate  a further  25  basis point  drop  in the  federal  funds  rateand  that produces somewhat  faster  growth later  in  1996  and in  1997,with the  unemployment  rate not  drifting any higher  and not muchfurther  improvement  occurring  in  the  pace of  inflation.As  I look  at  the  national  economy, Mr. Chairman,  I feelreasonably happy with the  result  that has  been attained, particularlyon  the  inflation  side.  The concern  that  I have  is  that  there may be9/26/95-15-more  softness  out  there  than is  indicated in  the numbers,  and  I amgetting  that  sense  in  the  anecdotal  information from directors  andother business people.  As we  consider  our  policy action,  I think  itmight  be well  to  begin  to  question whether potential  in  the  economy isactually somewhat higher  than we think  it  is  and the NAIRU  somewhatlower.  Along those  lines,  I am also  a little concerned  that  theGreenbook  forecast  shows  a level  of  growth throughout  the  forecasthorizon  that  is  somewhat below potential  as  now defined or  what wethink is  potential  at  about  2-1/2  percent.  That  obviously has  allkinds  of policy implications  that  I'll  save  for the  next go  around.Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  economic  growth in  the  TwelfthDistrict picked up  this  summer.  The  annual  rate of  job growth  inCalifornia has  accelerated by about  1 percentage point--from less  than1 percent this  spring  to  about  2 percent  currently.  The  early 1995oriented sectors such  as  retail  trade have shown  increases.  Also,retail  sales  have  been running well  above a year  earlier.  Elsewherein the West,  some  of  the most  rapidly growing  states  in the  nationhave resumed their  quick pace  of  expansion.  In Utah, manufacturingjobs  expanded rapidly  this  summer,  and construction employment surgedin both Oregon  and Nevada.  In  contrast, payroll  jobs  continued toappear resilient.  In  Washington State,  fast  growing industries  likesoftware  development, most notably of  course Microsoft,  are offsettingthe  effects  of  the  large  job losses  at Boeing.  In Idaho,  the ruralareas  dependent  on agriculture  or  forest products are weak, but high-tech manufacturing such as  that at  Micron Technology has  been holdingup growth  in  the Boise  area.  The previously rapid growth  in Arizona'smanufacturing economy was  stymied earlier  this  year by the  drop backin exports  to  Mexico, but  the  overall Arizona economy continues  toexpand.Turning to  the national  outlook, real GDP growth has pickedup to  a moderate pace  in  the current  quarter,  following the  inventorycorrection  in the  second quarter.  Our  forecast  shows  GDP growth  of2-1/4  to  2-1/2  percent  through  the  end of  next  year as  inventoryinvestment stops  declining  and housing picks up briskly.  A downsiderisk to  the  forecast,  one very similar to  that  mentioned by MikePrell,  is  that  equilibrium real  interest  rates  may be  shifting down  inresponse to prospects  for  lower  federal deficits,  making  our currentpolicy stance  tighter  than  it would otherwise be.  Recent  inflationnews  also has been  favorable  and market  inflation expectations  seem  tohave  come down a bit.  For the  future,  the  speed  effects from theslowdown in  the  economy in the  first  half  of  this year  should restraininflation  late  this year  and in  1996.  As we  have  discussed, laborcosts have come  in below expectations.  But before  euphoria sets  in,  Idon't anticipate  any progress unfortunately this  year and next  inreducing inflation below last year's  rate.  Despite favorableinflation numbers,  both CPI  and PPI  inflation so  far  this  year areabove  last year's  rates.  The unemployment  and capacity utilizationrates  indicate  that  it  is  unlikely that  there  currently  is  any excesscapacity pushing down on  inflation.  Overall,  under the  assumption ofa roughly constant  federal  funds  rate, our  forecast  shows  CPI9/26/95-16-inflation  at  3 percent  or  slightly less  in  1995,  1996,  and 1997--somewhat  above  last year's  2.6  percent  rate.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I think  it's  fair  to  say  that we have not  hadany dramatic  changes  in business  conditions  in our District,  but  onbalance my  sense  is  that  overall  conditions  in  the  District are  alittle  stronger  than  they were  at  the  time  of  our last meeting.  Weconduct monthly  surveys,  as  some  of you may know, of activity inmanufacturing, retailing, and the  services  sector.  Our manufacturingindex--the  last one  went through August--showed a significant  jumpover July.  Shipments,  orders,  order backlogs,  employment,  and theworkweek all  rose appreciably according  to  that  survey.  More broadly,I sense  that general  business  confidence is  increasing  in our  region.I am not  sure  this  greater  confidence  is  very deep yet, but  at  leastit's  there  for  the  time being.  If  I were  to  highlight  one  feature  ofthe  District economic  situation,  I think it  would be recent wagedevelopments.  We have had comments  on  that already, and I think mycomment might  go a little  in  the  other direction.  The manufacturingsurvey  I just mentioned has  a question about  factory wages.  Our lastsurvey--again  for  the month of  August--clearly indicated  significantupward pressure on wages over  the  last  six months  as  a whole.  Thatsurvey result  is  reinforced by  some  of  the  anecdotal  information weare hearing.  We had our  small  business  council meeting  last  week, andtypical  comments came  from a member from Charlotte who reported thatnobody  in that market  was paying  the  minimum wage  and that  over thelast  six months  entry-level wages  had  increased by anywhere  from  $.50to  $1.00  per hour.  Several  other members  confirmed his  comments.  Idon't want  to make  too much of  this.  Again, a majority of  thecomments  along these  lines  were  from people in  the  Carolinas  wherelabor markets  are  exceptionally tight.  It  appears  that  thisphenomenon  is  mainly concentrated in  the  skilled and  semi-skilledsegments  of  the  labor markets--the mechanics, construction workers,and  others.  But the  comments were  very striking, and I think  they areconsistent with at  least  some  of  the  national wage  data that  suggestthat  a gradual  upward trend in  the  growth of  wages may bear watching.With respect  to  the national picture, we  certainly don't haveany quarrel  with the  Greenbook forecast.  One of  our people  summed  itup by saying that  the  economy had landed softly and  the  Greenbook wasprojecting a long  runway.  I do  believe, though,  that  the  risk oferror  in  the  forecast  has  shifted perceptibly.  Earlier  this  year asyou may recall,  I was  a bit  concerned about  the  downside risk in  theoutlook.  Then, as  we got  into  the  late  spring and early summer,  itseemed to me  that  the  risks were  a little more balanced.  Now, I thinkthe  outlook has  shifted again, and it  seems  to  me  that  the  risk ismore  on  the  up side  than it  has been for  some  time.  The  economy lookspretty healthy to  me  right now.  I thought  the  rebound in  automobilesales  in August was  impressive.  Overall  consumer spending andconsumer confidence,  it  seems  to  me, have been more  firmly maintainedin a sense  than we might have  anticipated a few months  ago when we hadlots  of  comments about  the possibility of  a recession.  Also, I thinkthe  recovery  in housing  has been exceptionally solid.  We  got a lot  ofanecdotal  comments  to  back up  that view.  As  was  pointed out  in  theGreenbook, we may not yet  have  seen  the  full  impact  of  earlierreductions  in mortgage rates.  So,  again,  the  economy  looks  quitesolid to  me at  this  stage.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  risks  of  error  in9/26/95-17-the  forecast may have  shifted a bit  to  the up side  since  our  lastmeeting.  That makes me  a little nervous  since we are  operating  atclose  to  full  capacity  in many industries  and  sectors.Finally, Mr. Chairman,  I'd  like  to make  a quick comment onthe  fiscal  situation and its bearing on  the  outlook.  I gather thatanticipated  fiscal  restraint  is  a damping factor  in  the Greenbook'sprojections, and  that's perfectly reasonable.  But  I hope  that we willnot  give  this  factor undue weight  in our deliberations  today and  inthe near-term  future.  The  final budget  outcome  is  still  uncertain.The  impact of  any particular  outcome on  the behavior of  the aggregateeconomy  is  very difficult  to  predict.  Moreover,  as  is  often the  casewith monetary policy, I think there  is  a credibility  issue here.There  is  a real  risk that  if  the public  and especially the  financialsignificant degree  by fiscal  considerations, we  could losecredibility.  So,  I hope  that we will  continue  to  focus primarily onaggregate variables--GDP,  employment,  and the price level--which overtime  should reflect whatever  impact  fiscal  developments  are having onthe  aggregate  economy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Recent  data and  anecdotal  evidence  indicate  thatthe  economy  in  the  Philadelphia District  is  growing, but not  strongly;growth  continues  at  less than  the national pace.  Manufacturing hasreversed course after a weak first half  and  is  growing again.Residential  construction has  stabilized after a period of  weaknessearlier  in  the year.  Nonresidential activity is  up some around theDistrict,  driven by distribution and  retailing  facilities plus  somehotel  and entertainment-related construction.  Retail  sales  are up  alittle.  Banks  report  that  loan demand generally  is  flat;  where thereis  some  increase,  it  tends  to  be on  the  consumer side rather than  thecommercial  side.  Employment  levels  that  had been declining  earlier inthe  year have  stabilized and are rising, particularly outsidemanufacturing--in the  service  areas.Turning to  the  national economy, of  the  three broadcategories  of  slower, faster,  or moderate growth  outlined by MikePrell,  I am in the  moderate category.  I think  that we are  likely  tohead into a period where  sales  and production will grow at  asustainable pace in  1996.  I must  say, however,  that  as  I travelaround the  District--and I do  a lot more  listening  than  I do  speaking--I sense  that  the better business  confidence  is  probably broader  thanit  is  deep.  If  one  just  listens, one  gets more  of  the  tone  that it'sto  the  slower  side.  Now perhaps that's  the District.  If  one  probes,then, yes,  things  are better;  the  third quarter  is  better  than thesecond;  the  fourth probably will be  still  better, and 1996  looks  okay.But one does not  get  the  same  sense  of  optimism in  the businesscommunity generally as  when one  listens  to  economists  and professionalforecasters.  Phrases  like  "it  doesn't get much better  than  this,"just don't  ring true,  I think,  in  the business  community.  Maybe it'sjust human nature;  maybe  it's  our part  of  the  country;  but  there  justisn't  that underlying  enthusiasm about  the  future  that  one would hopeto  see.

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tenth Districteconomy remains  really strong, with  only a few signs  of  weakness  hereand there.  The  improvement  observed at midyear has  been sustained,with strength  reflected across  several  areas.  Employment  has postedhealthy gains  over  the  last  few months  in our  region.  Manufacturingstaged a pretty good rebound  in August  from what we can  tell,especially  in  the durable goods  area  including  automobiles.  And thenondurable goods  area, which had been a little weak in  our  area, isnow holding pretty steady as  we go  forward.  In  fact,  some  of  ourdirectors  report  that homebuilding  activity has  increased but  housingconstruction  still  can not  keep pace with the  strong demand in  someparts  of  our region.  We are  anticipating  some  improvement  incommercial building activity in  the  months  ahead as  indicated by loweroffice vacancy rates  in most  of  the  metropolitan areas  in  theDistrict.  Activity in  our energy  industry has picked up a bit,especially in Wyoming.  On  the  other hand,  the  District farm economycontinues  to  be  weak;  it  is  hurt  especially by  the  cattle  industrywhich  is  particularly important  to  our  region.  The  recent weather  inthe  northern and western parts of  the  District may have hurt  some  cropyields,  but  we  don't expect  a big  fallout  from  that.  Growth  in bankcredit has  slowed as  is  true elsewhere  in  the  country, and we  thinkthat may reflect  the effects  of  inventory adjustments.  While theDistrict economy generally appears  to  be  strong, wages  and  final  goodsprices  show no persistent  signs  of  accelerating,  though we are  findingthat  some  labor  markets  remain tight.  And we  are getting  indicationsfrom  our manufacturers  that prices  of  materials  are continuing underupward pressure.Looking at  the national  economy over  the  remainder  of  thisyear and into next year,  I expect growth  to remain  slightly belowtrend, but  in  the  2 to  2-1/2  percent  range,  which is  similar  to  theGreenbook forecast.  Now, I think such growth  is  appropriate,  givenwhere  the  long-run potential  seems  to  be  and  given the  current  levelof resource utilization  in  the  economy.  And that brings  me  to  theissue  of  inflation.  I am still  a little  less  optimistic  than  theGreenbook.  While  it  seems  likely to me  that  inflation will  be capped,I question whether the  overall  core  inflation rate  will drop much  inthe  next year, in  1996  at  least.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, you probably remember from  theboard meeting  that you attended a week or  two  ago at  the  Boston Fedour  characterization of  the  New England economy since  the  summer as  atale  of  two  sections.  Overall,  the region's  jobs  grew just  about  0.8percent during  the year  ending  in July--that compares with nationalgrowth  of better  than  2 percent--but  there were  distinct differencesbetween northern and southern New England.  The  northern states  ofVermont, New Hampshire,  and Maine are  all  experiencing growth  inemployment,  sometimes  even in manufacturing jobs which is  welcomed.They have  lower rates  of  unemployment  and their employment  levels  havereturned to  or near  their pre-recession peaks.  On  the  other hand, thesouthern states--Massachusetts,  Connecticut, and  Rhode Island--havenot  returned to  their pre-recession  employment peaks and are  notexpected to  do  so  anytime  soon.  I must  say,  though,  that  job  growthin Massachusetts  is much stronger  than in  either Rhode  Island orConnecticut.  Rhode  Island  in particular currently has  a level  ofemployment  that  is  below that  of  a year  ago and has  lost  jobs  in  each9/26/95-19-of  the  last  three months  for which we  have data.  The  state  isundisputably  the biggest basket case  in New England, which probablymakes  it  the  undisputed winner of  that  prize for  the  country as  awhole.  Rhode  Island  is  now edging  out  Connecticut, which up  untilrecently was winning  this  contest.  In  terms  of  job types,  growth asin  the past  is  largely in  trade, services,  and construction.  Defenseindustry cutbacks  continue.  New England fared relatively well  in  thelast  round of  base closings,  losing only one major base  and  about1,000  jobs,  but  the  region overall lost  32  percent  of  its  militarybase  employment  in the  years  1989  to  1994  as  compared with  about  halfthat rate  for  the nation as  a whole.I am coming  to  believe  that  the  anecdotes  we hear whentalking with business  groups  around the  District  are almostdiametrically opposite  the  standard economic  data  that we  get  for  theregion as  a whole.  Again, there may be  some  self-selection processthat  is  going on here.  Two  local  business confidence  indexes  showtheir  levels  a year  ago.  Our Beigebook  contacts  and members  of  ourNew England advisory council both report higher manufacturing salesthan  a year ago.  However, there  is  a dichotomy between healthy  salesgrowth and sales  prospects  and  indicators  of  future  employment.Business plans  and actual  sales  have been upbeat,  but  expectations  asto  job growth are  not.  Businesses  apparently are willing to  continueto  try  to  succeed with a proportionately smaller work force  thanbefore, perhaps because of  the  effect of  capital  investments  over  thelast  two  or  three years.  In addition, many business executives--representing small  and  large  firms--continue  to  report an  inability  toraise prices even  in  the  face of  rising demand.  Competition  remainstoo  keen.Turning to  District  lending, I reported earlier  that we  hadslower rates  of  loan growth  in  the First District  than  the  country asa whole.  That  situation has  corrected  itself,  not because we have hadfaster credit  growth in New England but  because  the  national pace hasslowed.  New England's  rate  of  loan growth  at  its  large banks wasabout  6 percent  in  the  last quarter,  about  the  same  as  the  currentrate  for  the nation as  a whole, but  the  latter  is  down from  aconsiderably stronger pace  earlier.On the  national scene,  I don't  find too much to  take  issuewith in the  Greenbook.  We  could argue,  given  the projection  foroutput,  that unemployment might  turn out  a tick higher  than  the  ratein the  Greenbook.  We  could question the  projected rates  of growthabroad, and I think Ted Truman  reflected  some concern  on  the  down sidewith regard to  foreign growth.  We could look at  consumer durables  andwonder  whether the projections  for  slower auto  sales  in the Greenbookreally will  be offset by consumer buying  in the  housing area.  Andwhile we don't know any more about  inventories  than  anybody else,  itis  reasonable to  be  agnostic about  any specific  projection there.However, while all  of  this does  suggest some downside risk to  theforecast,  it  really is  nitpicking.  In  the  context  of  a fairly  lowrate of  unemployment  and the  impetus  that  could come  from  financialthese  factors  does  seem to  us  to  hold out  the  promise of  economicbalance moving forward--that  is,  a tendency for  the various  factors  tooffset one  another.In sum,  our  view is  that  the  data reflect  a mixed bag  ofeconomic  information and  that  is  probably just what we  would hope  forto  keep us  on  target with moderate growth,  low unemployment, andrelatively  low inflation.  Risks  to  the  forecast  seem balanced orperhaps  slightly tilted to  the  down  side.  But  if  downside  risksemerge,  they can be easily  addressed.  For now,  economic conditionsseem pretty good and, given all  the  uncertainties,  I at  least  am drawnto  the  idea  that  they may be about  as  good as we  are going  to get.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman, we are  in general  agreement withthe Greenbook forecast,  so  I'll  focus  my comments  on developments  inthe  Seventh District.Overall,  it  appears  that  District economic  activity has beenpicking up in  the  third quarter.  Consumer spending seems  to  havestrengthened in  September.  Retailers  in  the  District generally reportthat while  the  hot, humid weather adversely impacted sales  in August,sales have  improved this  month as  the weather  turned cooler.  Retailinventories  are  reported to be at  generally satisfactory  levels.Another  area where we  are getting reports  of  a pickup  in activity isin homebuilding.  Sales  of  existing and new homes  have been on  anuptrend for  a while, but  it  is  only recently that  the  signs  of  apickup  in construction activity have  emerged.  We did have reports,however,  that  the hot weather  in August  slowed  some construction worktemporarily.In the  auto  industry,  sales  of  light vehicles have  fluctuatedconsiderably  in recent  months  in part  due  to  relatively  sharp  swingsin  fleet  sales.  In July and August,  sales were  at  an average  annualrate  of  14-3/4 million units,  and recent  reports we  received suggestthat  September  sales may  come  in  a bit  stronger than  this  average.Measures of  overall days'  supply moved down  toward desired levels  inproducers and among models.  The Ryder  truck  strike has  led to  someaccumulation  of  cars  and  trucks  at plants  and shipping points.However, the  strike  is  not  expected to  have  any impact until October.Better  selling models may then  be  at  risk, and in particular lighttrucks  and fleet  sales  could be depressed.  Members  of  our  advisorycouncil  on small  business reported  that dealing with the  Ryder  strikeis  being complicated by the  unavailability of  rail  cars  to pick up theslack in our  District.  In  the  last  few weeks we had discussions  witheach of  the  Big Three  auto makers  regarding their estimates  of  thelong-term  demand for motor vehicles.  In each case,  they have  reducedtheir  estimates  of  the  long-term trend rate  of motor vehicle  sales.The  primary factors  contributing to  this  reassessment  are  the  higherquality  and greater  durability of new vehicles and the  shift  from carsto  light  trucks,  which tend to  last  longer.District manufacturing output  stabilized in June  and July andnow  seems  to be  rebounding from a weak second quarter.  We  are  seeinga shift  from earlier  this year.  Producers  of  consumer goods  such asautos  and appliances  are now reporting increasing  output whileproducers  of  capital  goods are  the  ones  indicating a slowdown  inactivity, although reports  from key capital  goods  industries are  nowsuggesting that  the  second half of  1995  is  actually holding up betterthan  anticipated.  For example,  orders  for machine  tools have  slowed9/26/95-21-but  still  seem  to  be  running ahead of  earlier expectations,  in partreflecting strength  in  orders  for  small  machines.  Steel  production inthe District  increased considerably  from July to August  and thatpickup  continued  into  the  first part  of  September.  Shipments  ofappliances  to  dealers were quite  strong in August  and early September,and  it  now appears  that  the  expected shortfall  from last  year's recordpace will  be  smaller than  anticipated at  the beginning of  this  year.In  Iowa, problems  in  accessing rail  cars  have  left  some  grainelevators  still  full  even ahead of  this  year's harvest.  The rail  carproblems may have been  exacerbated by this  year's  surge  in grainexports, which contributed  to  longer  shipping distances and  slowerturnaround times  for rail  cars  as  well  as  the  transitional problemsassociated with  the merger between the  Union  Pacific  and the  ChicagoNorthwestern railroads.  Weather-related crop damage  this  year  isturning out  to be  worse than  expected for  vegetables  and corn, and  itnow appears that  an  early killing  frost may prematurely end  thedevelopment  of  some  late-planted fields,  especially soybeans.  Whilethe  grain harvest  is  now expected  to  be  about  average,  it  falls  shortof  the  record demand  for grain  observed over the  past year.  Grainprices have  risen  sharply and will  remain high until  there  is  evidencethat demand and supply are moving  into better balance.District  labor markets  remain tight  and wage pressurescontinue  to  intensify at  the  low end  of  the wage  scale.  In both Juneand July, the  average unemployment rates  in  the  five District  stateswere 4.6  percent, a full percentage point below the national  average.Finding  qualified entry-level  and skilled workers was  cited as  aserious  problem by virtually all  members  of  our  small business  andagricultural  advisory councils  when we met  with them earlier  thismonth.  After slipping  somewhat  during the  summer,  help wanted ads  inthe  region picked up  in early  September.  Union  leaders  I speak  toemphasize  the  insecurity factor  that  we  discussed before  in explainingwage  increases.  They emphasize  the  fact  that  corporate  restructuringshave  continued  even  though the  economy has  recovered, so  there  isconstant concern  about  losing one's  job even  though the  economy isdoing well.  Reports on prices  have been mixed but  they generallycontinue  to  indicate receding  inflationary pressures  in  input  prices.Price  increases  for packaging materials  have dissipated after  therapid increases  last  year and earlier  this  year,  and price  indexcomponents  of  the various  District purchasing managers' reportscontinued to  move  lower  through August.  However,  several  contactsnoted upward pressure  on building materials prices  resulting  infurther increases  for gypsum wallboard and  cement and renewed hikes  inlumber prices.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

MR. MCTEER.  Over  the past  few meetings  I have been reportingthat  the Eleventh District economy has  slowed from  its  very stronggrowth  in 1994  to  something  a little less  strong  this year.  Thismonth's  Beigebook singled  out  Dallas  and New York as  the  two  Districtswhose economies  have  slowed.  I should emphasize  that  the  slowing isfrom growth at  a very  strong pace to  a more moderate pace  and not aEleventh District  economy, employment  growth is  running at  3.4percent, only  slightly weaker  than the  3.8 percent posted over  thepreceding months.  Industrial production increased at  a 2.1  percent9/26/95-22-annual  rate  in  July, as  manufacturing output rebounded  from  fourmonths  of  weakness.  The housing picture  has  improved.  Single-familypermits  are  7 percent  above  last year's  level,  and  last  year  was  avery good year.  Gross  state product  increased  at  an  annual  rate of5.3  percent  in  the  first  quarter according  to  our  estimate,  and weexpect a pretty good number  for  the  current quarter  but probably notas high  as  in  the  first  quarter.  Mexico  continues  to  exert  asignificant  drag on  the District  economy, but not  enough  to  turn  theoverall picture  sour.  And  in  fact,  lost  exports  to Mexico have  beenlargely made up by a surge  in  exports  to  other parts  of  the world.Last  Thursday, we had a joint meeting of  our  Houston boardand our  small  business and agricultural  advisory council,  and  themembers  generally supported  the view that  overall  business activity isin pretty good  shape,  although they  reflected diminished confidenceabout  the  future.  They seem  to  be  in somewhat  of  a funk about  thefuture.  All  the  signs  are  indicating that  we  are having  a huge  turnin  the  Eleventh District  in that  our  economy is  remaking  itself verysignificantly.  We  are moving  from cow chips  to  computer chips![Laughter]  To  give you  some anecdotal  indications  of  what  is  goingon, AMD and Motorola have  each just  finished billion dollarsemiconductor plants  in Austin.  Applied Materials,  which manufacturesequipment  used in chip production, has added  1,000  jobs  in Austin.Texas  Instruments  is  speeding up  construction of  its  new microchipfactory  in Dallas.  National  Semiconductor  is  doubling the  capacity ofits  Arlington plant and will  spend  $600  million  annually over  the  nextfive years  to expand  capacity.  Dell,  Compaq, and Hitachi  are  allseeing strong growth.  This  is  all  computer-related activity, but wealso  are seeing big advances  in  other high-tech areas  such astelecommunications.  Ikea  is  building a second plant in  Fort  Worth.Ericsson was  just  awarded a $300  million  contract to  build  an advancedwireless  communications  technology  facility and will  be  hiring 800people within  the year.  PCS  Prime,  a telecommunications  company, isputting  its  national headquarters  in  Dallas.  These are  some  of  the"biggies" and there  also  are a number  of  small  companies  expanding ormoving  into  the  area.  Very strong global demand  for high-techproducts  continues  to  stimulate  demand  for  Eleventh District exports.Thanks  to  the  remake of  the  District  over  the past decade,  we  not onlyare relying less  on  cows  than we were but also  less  on oil  and gas.The  share  of  the oil  and  gas  sector  in  the  Texas  economy has  declinedfrom  roughly 18  percent in  1982  to  about  6 percent  today.  Our healthservices  industry is  now almost as  large  as  the  oil  and gas  industry.In  short,  a lot  of  activity is  going on  that  is  adding a lot  ofstimulus  to  our  regional  economy, and all  that  is  in  addition  to  thestimulative  impact  we  expect  to  get  from Deion  Sanders when hearrives.  [Laughter]On the  national  economy, the  slowing of  inflation has beenvery welcome, and I think  the probability of  a recession has  recededsignificantly.  The  economy probably could take  some  stimulus withoutan  acceleration  of  inflation.  On  the  other hand,  the  situation isright  for a further  ratcheting down of  inflation.  I believe  thatpolicy decisions  at  this  juncture probably depend more  on  the prioritywe give our  goals  than  on  the  state  of  the  economy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President Melzer.9/26/95-23-

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  The  Eighth District  economycontinues  to  grow at  a pace  largely unchanged  from  recent reports.  Ingeneral,  negative  news  appears  to have been mostly offset by plantexpansions, new hiring,  and  sales  gains.  Reported layoffs  fromdownsizing and plant  closings are  scattered  throughout  the  District,and  such layoffs  are  somewhat more concentrated in  durable  goodsproducers  than in  other industries.  But  sales  at  firms  in manyindustries--this  is  based on  anecdotal  reports--for  instance,prefabricated metal buildings,  electric  motors, brick manufacturing,and  scrap metal,  are  up  on average  between 7 and  15  percent  so  farthis year.  District payroll  employment  is  up about  1-1/2  percentyear-to-date, about  the  same rate  of  increase  as  in  the  nation as  awhole.  The  transportation equipment  sector  is  the  District'sstrongest, having grown  consistently for  nearly  two years.  Districtautomobile production  is  expected  to  jump  considerably in  the monthsahead;  planned fourth-quarter production  is  estimated at  about  338,000units,  up  nearly 29 percent  from  the  second-quarter level.  That  hasto do with  some new lines  that  are  opening up, particularly  for  theproduction of  light  trucks.A survey of  225  small  businesses  in  the  District  found  thatmost expect  little change  in  business  conditions  over  the  last  half  of1995.  About 20  percent  of  the  responding  firms  said  they expect  toraise prices  over  the  next three  months, while  less  than 3 percent  areplanning to  reduce prices.  These  District price trends  mirror  thenational  outlook.  Private forecasters predict  that  inflation  in  1995,a year of  trend growth  in real  output,  will be  higher  than inflationin  1994,  a year of  rapid growth  in real  output.  Over  the next  18months  the most optimistic  forecasts,  including  our own Greenbook,place CPI  inflation at  its  current  level,  while the more pessimisticforecasts  see  CPI  inflation rising  to  4 percent.  The central  concernof  this  Committee  should be progress  toward price stability, and thereseems  to  be  little prospect that  substantial  gains will  be madeanytime  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Inflation  forecasts with horizonsof  five years  or more  indicate  that market participants do not  expectinflation  to  decrease  from current  levels.On  the  national  level,  the  economy  is  recovering from  theslowdown  in  the  second quarter.  Payroll employment  jobs haveincreased at  a fair,  if  uneven, pace  over  the  summer and  seem poisedto  resume a more  stable growth path  through the  autumn.  One concernin  the national  outlook is  the  stance of  fiscal  policy.  I would liketo  associate  myself with what Al  Broaddus  said before  and reiterate myview that  monetary policy should focus  on price stability  and not  tryto  offset  temporary effects  of  deficit  reduction  on aggregate demand.The  suggestion  that  the  Committee  can effectively do more  than that  isin my view overselling  our abilities,  given uncertainties  about  themagnitude and  timing  of  the  effects of  deficit  reduction as  well  as  ofour  own policy actions.Let me  conclude with a few comments  on  financial  indicators.Total bank loan  growth has  been rapid over  the  last  two years  and,along with solid growth  in M2  since  the beginning of  1995,  seems  toindicate  continued  strength in  the national economy.  In  the EighthDistrict,  total bank  loans  have been  growing at  double-digit  ratessince mid-1994.  At  the  same time  in  the  nation as  a whole,  totalcheckable deposits  and  total  reserves, which grew at  rapid ratesthroughout  1992  and 1993,  have  been  subject to  a marked  runoff  since9/26/95-24-the  beginning of  1994.  In my  view, which  I think you  all  know, narrowmonetary aggregates  such  as  total  reserves  and the  monetary baseadjusted  for changes  in  reserve  requirements are  important  indicatorsof  the  stance  of  monetary policy over  longer periods  of  time.However, the  adoption by  depository institutions  of  sweep  accountssuggests  the  need to  interpret  these indicators  flexibly in  the nearterm.  Estimates by  the St.  Louis  staff,  which are  consistent withwhat  is  in  the  Bluebook,  suggest  that  sweep programs could be adoptedby depositories holding  as  much as  3/4  of  required reserves and 80percent  of  aggregate  reserve balances.  I think it  is  essential  thatwe  continue  to monitor  these programs because  even with  all  thecontroversy  in interpreting  the various  monetary aggregates,  theprovision of  an  appropriate supply of  reserves  relative to demand  isthe  core of  the  implementation of  monetary policy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

MR. STERN.  The Ninth District  economy remains  strong.  Labornear an  all-time  low.  Particularly bright  spots  in  the  economy  areconstruction, both residential  and  commercial,  mining and  energyoutput,  and forest products.  The  only major exceptions  to  thisgenerally favorable picture are  cattle producers, who are beingadversely affected by  low prices--but  that  is  coming off  seven  oreight pretty  good years--and tourism, where  apparently the  summerseason  turned out  to  be mediocre;  again,  that  is  coming off  severalback-to-back very strong years.As  far  as  the  national  economy is  concerned, I have noproblem with  the  general  path of  the Greenbook  forecast, and I am hardpressed to  identify a particular bias  in  the  risks.  Our modelforecast  is more  optimistic  than  the  Greenbook--more  optimistic  in  thesense  that  we have  slightly more  growth  in  1996  and  1997  and slightlyless  inflation.  In fact,  we  have  a deceleration of  inflation.  Givenour  inability to  be precise  about  these  things,  I would judge  eitheroutcome  to  be acceptable.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, broad measures ofemployment suggest  that  economic growth  ticked up  in recent weeks  inthe  Second District.  If,  however, as  President  McTeer  suggested, ourtwo  Districts  are  the  weak Districts,  I'd  like  to merge  immediately.In August, payroll employment  rose  at an annual  rate  of  2 percent  inNew Jersey and 0.7  percent  in New York.  Mergers, closures,  andlayoffs  continue  to monopolize  the  headlines  and to  affect confidenceadversely.  In  fact,  new business formations  continue  to  exceedclosures and  the  number of  firms  increased by about 2-1/2  percent  inthe  second quarter  in New Jersey and about  1/2  percent  in New York.That  suggests  support  for  a slow-to-moderate  expansion  in regionalemployment and renewed confidence  among regional businessmen.  On  theother hand, consumer demand appears  to have  weakened.  Our  contactsreported that  existing home  sales  in August  were  10  to  15  percentbelow a year  ago while permits  for new home construction declinedsignificantly.  Senior  loan officers  reported a marked deteriorationin  consumer loan  demand, and our retail  contacts  reporteddisappointing August sales.  The newspapers are  full  of  clothing9/26/95-25-advertisements.  The decline  in  August  tax  collections  tended toconfirm our  survey results.On  the  national  level,  assuming  an unchanged policy, ourforecast  agrees so  closely with  that  of  the Greenbook  that ourslightly higher  forecast  of  CPI  inflation next  year--3.1  percent ascompared to  2.9 percent--has  little  significance  and  is  more  in thecategory of  a rounding error.  We  do believe,  however, that  the  risksto  the  forecast  are  somewhat  slanted to  the down  side,  in part becausethe  remaining  level  of  manufacturing  inventories  seems  to  be  higherthan desired by manufacturers.  We  also wonder whether business  fixedinvestment  could be  somewhat weaker  in  1996  and 1997  because  of  somerecent weakness in  sales  of  durable goods.  We are not  so  concernedabout this  downside  risk that we  think it  requires  immediate action onmonetary policy, but we do  think  that  the  risks  we had deemed to  beabout balanced are  now noticeably shifted  to  the  down  side.  Thankyou.

MR. JORDAN.  At  a recent  joint board meeting, one  of  ourdirectors  whose  firm employs  a lot  of  people  in  four of  the  states  inthe  region  listed a number  of  the major metropolitan areas  and saidthe  employment  situation was  very bad there.  I interrupted  to  ask himto  clarify what  he meant  and his  reply was  that he  could not hireanybody.  [Laughter]  His  firm runs  ads  and nobody applies.  There  hadbeen a general  feeling in  the  spring,  among large and  smallbusinesses,  about  what  was described  as  the  "hitting the  wall"phenomenon, and  that  is  largely gone.  People  generally have  overcometheir  earlier worries about  the  outlook.  We  get  reports  thatresidential  construction,  both single-family and multifamily,  is  quitegood throughout  the  District.  Commercial real  estate is  doing verywell.  There  are persistent comments  about  tight  labor marketseverywhere except  in western  Pennsylvania.  We  even heard one  reportof bounties  to  hire people  where employers  tell  existing employeesthat  if  they bring in  somebody--a friend, a relative,  or anyone--whoapplies and gets a job,  the  existing employee will get  a bonus.That's  a novel approach  for  the  labor  market.  We  have reports  thatcollege  enrollments, both public  and private,  are at  record levels,though there  is  some discounting  on tuition  in order to  attractstudents  to  smaller private  schools.  The only sector of  clearweakness  throughout  the District  is  health  care;  there are continuedcomments  about downsizing of  the  health care  labor  force.I want  to make  a couple of  comments  about  the  fiscalsituation.  I don't  know what  the Wall  Street  view is--I'll  leave  thatto  Peter Fisher  or somebody else--or  the  foreign portfolio managerview, but  I think there  is  a different view on Main Street than  in  thefinancial  markets.  If  you were  to walk  down the streets  of  Wooster,Ohio  and tell  people that  the government  might  decide  to  cut  thegrowth  of  government  spending,  reduce  the  budget deficit, maybe withsome  tax elements  in the  fiscal  package,  and that  this was  going tohave  a bad effect on  the  economy and  that monetary policy would needto  do  something  to  offset  it,  they would wonder what planet you camefrom!  Whatever people  in  effect  think about  the  size of  fiscalmultipliers,  let  alone what  their  sign might be  or  their  timing, Ithink we need  to  be very careful not  to  communicate  the  idea  thatanything that  is  done  on  the  fiscal  side  is  somehow negative and  that9/26/95-26-this  undesirable  event will  require  an  offsetting or  compensatingmonetary policy action.  I don't  think  that  is  going to  play very wellout  there on Main  Streets  across  the  land.On  the Greenbook  forecast,  I have given  a lot  of  thought  tothis  issue  of  what  the  level  of  the  funds  rate  implies  with regard  toeither economic  growth or  inflation.  I have  reviewed  the experienceof  the  last couple  of  years.  Two years  ago  at  this point  we  thoughtthat  the  head winds might be  diminishing.  The  federal  funds  rate  wasaround 3 percent and as  late  as  December  1993  the  Greenbook wasprojecting continued anemic  or  subpar growth and actually an  increasein  inflation  in 1994.  Of  course,  what happened is  that  the  funds  ratewent up a lot  in  1994;  real  growth was  very strong;  and  inflation camein below what  had been projected  in  the  Greenbook.  In August  1994,  weincreased the  funds  rate  from 4-1/4  to  4-3/4 percent  and many thoughta rate  of  5-1/2  percent might eventually be  the  right  level.  Inpercent  by the  middle of  this  year  just  to  try and keep  a lid onthings  so  inflation would not  take off.  Of  course, what has  happenedis  that we  have  a funds  rate  that  is  over 100  basis  points below thatlevel  and  the  inflation  outlook is  better  than  it  was  expected to  be.The  lesson for  me is  that we  can have errors  in  our  forecasts  ofoutput growth  and inflation  in both  directions,  and they don'tnecessarily go  together.  When  I look at  something  like  the  Blue Chipforecast  or other  forecasts,  they tend to  indicate  that  the moregrowth we have,  the more  inflation.  That  simply is  not  theexperience;  we are  not  in a world that  says more  growth causes higherprices  and vice versa.  So,  I think we need  to  be very careful  abouthow we  talk about  the  relationship of  the  funds  rate  and the  growth  inoutput and any implications  the  latter might have  for the purchasingpower  of  money.  I do  agree with  the  emphasis  of  some  people  that  thisis  the  right  time  to  keep a long-term  focus  and not be perceived asreacting  to  events  either  in  the  economy or  fiscal policy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Mr. Chairman, my opinion about  the nationaleconomy has  changed very little  since our  last meeting.  Although theinventory adjustment may not be  entirely behind us,  the varioussectoral  reports on  spending  seem consistent with continued growthover  the next year  or  so at  a pace  close  to trend.  I interpret recentinflation reports  as  confirming that prices  remain well  contained.  Atthis stage  I think the biggest  single risk  to  the  outlook  comes  fromthe  fiscal  situation.  Although the  odds  of  a train wreck remain  low,a default  on  the  government  debt could touch  off  financialrepercussions  that would greatly upset Greenbook types  of  projections.But,  of  course,  on  that  score we will  just have  to  wait and see whathappens.The  longer-term problem that  confronts us  at  this  stage,though,  is  gauging whether  the  federal  funds  rate remains  above thelevel  that  is  needed  to  achieve  trend growth  further out  in  theforecast period, and  I mean in  late  1996  and 1997  and beyond.  Thatseems  a long way off,  but  the  Greenbook simulations  reveal what  wealready know, namely, that  the  lags  in monetary policy aresufficiently long  that  any policy changes  that we might undertake overthe  next months  would have their maximum effect  in  1997.  While  it  is9/26/95-27-looking  into  the  distant  future,  I don't  think  it's  entirely prematureto  be  thinking that  far ahead.  What  I think the Greenbook projectionssuggest  is  that  the real  funds  rate  is  a little  too  high to  supporttrend growth with  the assumed  degree of  budget contraction,  and it  mayturn  out  that  the  budget contraction will  be greater;  we will  see.In this  sense  I think we  have what  Charles Schultz  dubbed a"termites in  the basement" problem, although he was  using that phraseto  talk  about  the  federal deficits  of  years  ago.  A  "termites  in  thebasement" problem  is  a nagging, chronic  little problem  that  caneventually cause a lot of  grief  if  it  is not  attended to.  Termitesnibble away  slowly so  the  problem just  creeps up  and  there  is  no  greatsense  of  urgency that one absolutely has  to deal  with it  on  one day asopposed to  the  next.  That  is  how I perceive the  Greenbook outlook.  Ithink  there  appears to  be  a problem there.  It  starts  as  a smallproblem, but unless  it  is  attended to  it will  grow  into a moresignificant problem.  Simulations  that we have  done with the MPS modelreveal  that  after 1997--I  know  that  is  a long way out--the problemreally begins  to  snowball  into a crisis.  The MPS  simulation suggeststhat  if  the budget  is balanced by 2002,  the real  funds  rate  would needto  decline  from  roughly its present  level  of  about  2-3/4  percent  toabout  1-1/4  percent.  If  the  funds  rate  stays where  it  is,  the  economyis  not  likely  to  remain  on  an  even keel.  I would also note  that  theGreenbook and the MPS model  are  not  alone  in  reaching this  conclusion.Many outside  forecasters are  predicting an  eventual decline  in thefunds  rate.  That  also seems  to be  the  conclusion of  participants infinancial  markets  since  longer-term yields  apparently embody anassumption of  declining  short-term rates.  I think that  adjustments  inlong-term market  rates  could easily suffice to  keep  the  economy oncourse, but  they are predicated on  at  least  an  eventual adjustment  inthe  federal  funds  rate.  Again, as  the Greenbook suggests,  I think theoutlook  for  the  near term,  next  year and  even  the next two  years,looks good.  I don't  view this  as  a crisis,  but  I do  believe  there  isa "termites  in  the  basement" problem.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I can't  top  that!  On the  fiscal  situation, theGreenbook now assumes  that the  Congress  ultimately will  pass  85percent  of  the reductions  called for  in  the  Congressional budgetresolution.  Believe  it  or  not,  I think  that  assumption is  still  alittle too  low.  I think it  will be  more  like  95  percent, but at  leastwe are getting closer and  at  this  point I see  no  reason to  quibble.The net  effect  of  that  is  a negative  fiscal  impulse  for  1996  of  3/4percent of  GDP.  I want  to  talk about  what  that  means  for  the  forecastin just  a second, but  there were  two  comments  related  to the  fiscalsituation  that  I would like  to  return to.  I forget--what  town  inOhio?

MS. MINEHAN.  Wooster.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Wooster.  Well,  I didn't hear  it  right.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I said that  for  Don Kohn's benefit.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  The question I would pose is  what would I hearif  I were  to  go  to Wooster,  Ohio just  after Thanksgiving.  Everyonehas  come  to  grandma's house  and a cousin,  who unlike all  other  federal9/26/95-28-workers  is  a good worker,  [Laughter]  has  been  laid  off  and tells  histale at  the Thanksgiving  table.  I think  there would be a perceptibleview  that  federal  spending will  indeed slow down and  that  if  even thishard working person  with  the  safest employer has  lost his  job, whosejob  is  safe?  So,  I do  think  that  in  spite  of what people  believe, andas  you know  I am hardly an  advocate of big government,  thetransitional  effects  of  moving people  from  the public  sector  to  theprivate  sector are real.  I think  the people  in Wooster will  know itafter Thanksgiving.With regard  to  the  role  of  monetary policy,  I completelyconcur with  the view expressed by  some  that  what we  should look  at  isnot  fiscal  policy per se  but  its  effect  on  aggregate  demand.  On thatpoint I would note  that  the  Greenbook has projected nominal GNP growthof  4.4  percent  in  1996  and  3.9  percent  in  1997.  Two years  ago  Ididn't  think we would  see  3-point-something percent during my term  asa governor despite  our pursuit  of  price  stability unless  we had amajor recession.  Frankly, 3.9  percent  is  below what  I would think  ofas  an  appropriate  target  for  nominal  GDP.  So,  I don't  disagree withyour  theory.  I would say  3.9  percent means  that we  are at  pricestability in  effect.  That would be,  say, a 2-1/2  percent  trend rateof  growth  and 1.4  percent  inflation.  That sounds  like  a definition ofprice  stability  to  me.  So,  we  are  there.Returning to  the  question about  the  fiscal  impulse,  if  we  didhave a negative 3/4  percent  fiscal  impulse,  it  would mean that  to  get2-1/4 percent  growth next  year the  rest  of  the  economy  should have  atrend growth rate  of  3 percent  in  it.  That does  not  seem plausible  tome, particularly when we are  at  5.6  percent  unemployment  already.There  is  another alternative, and that  is  that we have had acompletely painless  and seamless  transition from  fiscal  contraction toprivate  sector expansion;  but  I don't  think that  comports withreality.  So,  let's  go back  to  the  possibility of  3 percent growth  ofthe private  economy as  the underlying assumption here.  If we  look atwhat has happened to  the  incomes and wages  of people,  the  reason  thatwe  are not  seeing  inflation accompanying  the  low unemployment  rate  isthat  structural changes  have occurred in  the  labor market.  They aremanifest in  the  fact  that  the wage  share  of personal  income hasshare was  59  percent;  in July it  was  57  percent.  At  the margin  in  thelast  12  months, wages have accounted  for  only  50  percent  of  increasedpersonal income.  It  is  not hard to  understand how we  can  get bothlack  of  inflation  and an  improvement  in  the unemployment  rate when infact wages  are being  suppressed.  The problem  is  that we  cannot  havewages  that continue to be depressed  and have  a 3 percent  expansion ofthe  real private  economy;  it  just  does  not  add up.  One of  two  thingscan happen:  In  one, workers  get  restless, wages  go up,  the profitshare  falls,  and  there is  upward pressure  on  inflation.  That  isscenario  "one"  that  Mike described.  Or  we get  scenario  "two,"  wherethe  demand  is  not  there, we  do not  in  fact have  3 percent  expansionex-government  in  the  economy, and we get  slower growth  than  theGreenbook is  forecasting.  My own bet  is  that  the  second result  ismore  likely than  the  first.  Certainly, when we  are talking about  4.4percent nominal  GDP growth going down  to 3.9  percent nominal  GDPgrowth,  I hesitate  to  think what  the  trend is  going  to  lead  to.Clearly, we have a real  federal  funds  rate  that  is  too  high.  I guessI couldn't camouflage myself  as a termite,  but  I end up  tearing down9/26/95-29-the  house  just  like  the  termites do  in Governor Yellen's  story.  Thankyou.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I am not  going  to  try  to pick  up on  thatanalogy!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I appreciate your not  doing that.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Let me make a brief  intervention because  like  somany others and  the way Mike  Prell  started  this  morning, I see verylittle  change  from where we were in  August.  Relative  to  theGreenbook, I continue  to  believe  that  the  risks,  if  that  is  the  properword, are  on  the up  side and  I am  in the  camp  that would be  closer tothe more bullish  of  the  three  scenarios  that Mike  Prell  presented  thismorning, for  all  the  reasons  that  he  discussed.I would like  to  offer  a thought  or  two  about  the  fiscaldeficit  situation.  First of  all,  1996  is  an  election year, and we  aretalking about  deficit  reductions  that  would be put  in place bylegislation that  is  not yet  passed, although the  new fiscal year  isupon us.  Assuming they  do get  passed,  it will  take  some time  to  getthem largely in place.  So,  I would be surprised  if  it  turned out  thatthere was  a great deal  of  additional  fiscal  drag  in  the year  1996.  Italso  is worth noting  that  in  the  last  three  fiscal  years  the  deficithas  come down  from  a level  in excess  of  $280  billion to  probably lessthan  $160  billion  in  fiscal  1995.  That  is  a lot  of  deficit  reductionin a 3-year  time  period.  And yet  we had 3 percent plus  real  GDPgrowth in  1993  and 4 percent  plus  growth  in  1994,  and  1994 was  theyear when  the biggest part of  that  deficit  reduction  took place.Deficit reduction  has  a lot  of  positive  impacts,  and in  the  aggregatewhatever deficit  reduction does  take place--and I hope  a program willbe  enacted--I  think  there  is  every expectation  that  its  negativeeffects  can easily be  overcome by all  the  positive impacts  that  getthrown off  from it.  In August  I remarked on what seemed to  be  anexceptional number  of  rather basic questions  that,  taken  together,  arelargely going  to  dictate  the  nature of monetary policy in  the years  tocome.  They include  issues concerning the  trend in  fiscal  policy, thelevel  of  the NAIRU,  the need  for  improved measurement  of  the  inflationrate,  the  trend of productivity, the  longevity of  this  absence of wagepressures  that we  see  today, and  the persistence  of household debtformation.  It  is  going to  take  a while  for  a lot  of  these  things  toplay out,  but  I do  think we  are  in  a good position right  now to  waitand  see how all  this  evolves.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My remarks will  beshort  this morning.  In view of  the  revised GDP number that  we  havereceived since  the  last  meeting and the  somewhat mixed economicsignals  that  we have  been getting  and certainly have  discussed aroundthe  table  today,  I think it's  fair  to  say  that  the  inventory cycle mayhave  flattened out  to  some extent.  Inventory adjustments  are  likelyto  stretch more  into  the  future.  Except for  this  shift  in  theinventory  adjustment process,  the  situation  seems  to  be working outmuch the  way that was  discussed  at  the  last meeting.  Demand has heldup.  We  didn't  slip  into a downward spiral  coming out  of  the  inventory9/26/95-30-adjustment process.  Specifically, consumer  spending and housing haveshown  improvement.  And although business investment  growth  is  slowingsomewhat, we  all  recognize  that  the previous  rates  of  expansion werenot  sustainable.  Employment  is  holding  fairly steady.  People appearto  be  learning  to  live  in  this  newly re-engineered world.  Newbusinesses are  starting up and are  absorbing some  of  the  displacedworkers.  I think the  financial markets  since  our  last meeting havereflected the resolution of  the  inventory  situation.  They generallyhave  improved--the dollar,  the  stock market,  the bond markets.  Thismeans  a continued  availability of  relatively  low cost  capital,  whichbodes well  for  the  business investment  outlook.  In  this  environmentwe have  had good news  with respect  to  inflation, which appears  to  bereasonably well  controlled.  However,  I would point out  that we have  adistance  to  go  on getting  the  inflation  rate down, and it  is  going  tobe harder  and harder  to  make progress.I guess  I am having a difficult  time  signing  on  to  thestories  that  are  floating around  about significant  upside risks,  oneof  Mike  Prell's  three  scenarios.  With employment remaining  acontinuing concern,  while  this  is  a positive  influence  for  inflation,job  uncertainty means  that we are  unlikely to  see  significantexpansion  in  consumer  spending.  Continuing  inventory  adjustments  inthe  face  of  fairly steady demand are  probably going  to  make businessesa bit  leery of  expanding  significantly.  We  have  talked a bit  aboutthe  pending  train wreck  and how much  of  a fiscal  drag  that  is  goingexert.  I think that  under any circumstances  there  is  going  to  be  somekind of  a drag, but  the  question is  what kind and how much.  I am notsure  that we  have  a good handle  at  this  point  on what kind  of  fiscaldrag we will  see.In  sum,  I think  the  outlook is  for  slow growth  in  the  nearterm.  I do  think there  are  a couple of major unknowns.  The  trainwreck scenario  is  one  and we don't  fully understand  the  implicationsof  a potential  train wreck.  On the  down  side,  it  could produce  a lotof  uncertainty in  the  financial  markets, and  it's  hard to  know whatkind  of  uncertainty that might engender  in  the  general  economy.  Thesecond unknown relates  to  the  fact  that most  people  seem to  befocusing on  an  outlook of  2 to  2-1/2 percent  growth  in real  GDP, with2 percent  suggested  in  the  Greenbook for  1997.  I would point  out  thatwe are  going into an election year, and I wonder whether  2 to  2-1/2percent  is  going to  be deemed politically and socially acceptable.  Isuspect  that  there might be  a lot  more pressure building in  theupcoming year for  a stronger economy.  Even  though economists  aresaying this  is  about  as  good as  it  gets,  I wonder whether  folks  onMain Street will  see  it  that way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There are  two basicreasons  for  revising a forecast  from  one meeting to  another.  One  isthat you receive  news  that  makes you change your mind;  the  other  isthat you goofed  the  last  time.  I don't  think either  one  is  true  inthis  case.  I don't  think the  staff  goofed the  last  time.  I see  thenews  that has  come  in since  the  last FOMC meeting as being  entirelyconsistent  with  the  staff  forecast,  as  I think Mike  does.  The  economyhas  been  following the  script  laid out  in  the previous Greenbook--toward  the much hoped-for soft  landing.  So,  to me,  the  epsilon in  thenews has  been roughly  zero  in  the  last  five  weeks;  and, appropriately9/26/95-31-the  Greenbook  forecast has  changed very little--negligibly  in  fact.Indeed, as  I read  over  the minutes  of  the August  22  meeting  lastnight,  I had a strong  sense  of  deja vu.  I thought  I was  reading  theminutes  of  this  meeting and  it  had not yet occurred!  I suspect  thatwhen Norm drafts  the  minutes  for  this  meeting, they  are going  to  looka lot  like  those  for  the August meeting.  In  fact,  he won't have  to  domuch work.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  He  can just  xerox last meeting'sminutes!

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes.  A  number of  us  observed last  time--fewerof  us  today maybe because we  are  getting used to  the  idea--that  thisscenario  is  too good to  be  true.  Almost everybody  said  that  lasttime;  very  few people  said it  today.  To be  sure,  it  is  five weekscloser  to  coming true  than it  was  five weeks  ago;  but  it's  still  alittle too  good to  be  true.  [Laughter]  I believe, as  Sue  Phillipsjust mentioned and  others  too,  that the  biggest  risk remains  the  stepinto  the  unknown that  Capitol Hill  and the White House  are about  totake.  It  could all work  out  fine,  or it  could work out  to be  acatastrophe.  There is  no  way to  predict  that.  But  to  me it  presentsa downside  risk, not  an upside risk.  It's  hard for  me  to  see  itgiving a big boost  to  the  economy.Last  time,  I called attention  to  a feature  in  the Greenbookforecast that you  could barely  see.  You  almost needed a microscope  tosee  it.  That  feature  was  that  by  the end of  the  forecast, which wasthen  the  fourth quarter  of  1996,  a small gap  had opened up betweenactual  and potential  GDP, and  that  gap was  growing slowly.  So,  if  itwas  extrapolated beyond  1996  one  would see an  uptrend  in unemploymentand a downtrend in  inflation.  In  the  current Greenbook forecast,which has  now gone  out  one more year, this  gap  is  more visible;  but  itstill  is  not very dramatic.  The  real  growth rates  for  the  years  1995,1996,  and 1997  of  the  forecast period  read 2.1,  2.2,  and 2.0  percent--all,  as  Bob Forrestal  and others  have noted, below  the  growth rate  ofpotential.  Consequently, the  annual average unemployment  rates  ofthose three  years go  5.7,  5.9,  and  6.1  percent.  That  is  where theGreenbook stops.  But  that  is  not where  the  world will  stop.  The coreCPI  inflation reads  3.1,  2.8,  and  2.7  percent.  So we  see  a pattern  ofThe  reason it  is  there  now is  the  same  reason  it was  therefive weeks  ago--which  is  that,  if  inflation  is  indeed  capped at orbelow 3 percent as  the Greenbook  says and as  I believe, the actualreal  federal  funds rate  is  almost certainly  above the  equilibrium realfederal  funds  rate.  Several people  have observed this,  and GovernorYellen  in particular has  emphasized it.  That  means  that  by somereasonable definition--I guess my definition of  a reasonabledefinition is  that  I can't  come up with a better one--monetary policyis  restrictive.  It  is  very hard  to  define the  "zero"  on  monetarypolicy, but  this  is  as good a way as  I know.  And that monetaryrestraint--that  is  to  say the  gap between  the  actual  real  federalfunds  rate  and the  equilibrium  real  federal  funds  rate--probably willbe greater the  more fiscal  restraint  there  is.This  is  a process  that naturally  snowballs.  I am sorry, butI am making  tacit  reference  to  termites here,  though I wasn't going  touse  the  term.  You  start with  a real  funds  rate  that  is  a little  too-32-high;  that  opens  up  the  gap;  that  leads  to  lower  inflation.  If  youhold  the nominal  funds  rate  steady,  the  real  funds  rate  gets  higherbecause monetary policy is  not  standing still  but  actually  istightening as  inflation declines;  and that  leads  to  a larger gap  andso  on.  You will  recognize  that  this  is  exactly the  argument  that wasused,  correctly, on  the  up  side  against  rising inflation  in  the  1960sand  1970s  to  explain why it  was  foolish  to  target  the  nominal  interestrate.  It's  just  as  foolish  to  target  the  nominal  interest  rate on  thedown  side,  and I don't  think we are  doing that.I had asked the  staff,  and Governor Yellen mentioned this,  touse  the  MPS model  to  run  the  Greenbook forecast  out  further, holdingthe  nominal  fed  funds  rate  at  5-3/4  percent, because you can  justbarely see  what  is  going on by  the  fourth quarter  of  1997.  When thestaff  did this,  they assumed that  we would reach a balanced budget  bythe  year  2002.  I don't  remember that  I specified  that.  I might  have,but  I don't  recall doing  so.  In any event,  it  has  the  consequence  ofcalling  for  the  dramatic  reduction  in  the  equilibrium  funds  rate  thatout  of  that  simulation,  the  unemployment rate  rises  from 6.2  percentin  the  fourth quarter of  1997,  which  is  where  the Greenbook  turns  off,to  about 7 percent a year  later  and about  8 percent  a year later  thanthat.  And then  it  just keeps  on  going up because  the  economy  is  on  anunstable path in  this  forecast.  By  the year  2002,  you don't even wantto  think about  the  unemployment rate.  The  inflation  rate  falls  fromwhere  it  is  now, around  3 percent,  to  about  1 percent by 1999  in  thispath.  Then  it,  too,  keeps  going;  and by the year  2002,  when  thebudget  is  balanced, the  economy  is  experiencing a heavy  deflation thatmakes  the  current Japanese  standard look wildly inflationary.Now, that  is  not  a forecast.  Nobody  should take  thisparticular model  literally and nobody does.  I think  not  even theproprietors  of  the model  take  it  literally.  I certainly don't  and Idon't worry  that people around  this  table will.  Furthermore, we wouldnot  let  it  happen.  The  economy is  not  going to  go  to  minus  7 percentinflation and  10  percent  unemployment.  The point  of  the  exercise  isto  indicate  whether the  path we  are on  is  a sustainable path or  anonsustainable path.  It  suggests  that  the  current  real  federal  fundsrate  is  probably unsustainably high.  And it  shows  us  that  the  effectsof  this discrepancy  start  very small,  so we don't  really  see  them, butthey build.I am now in what  will  appear  in  the  transcript as  the  lastparagraph--into  policy, though  just  a little--in  anticipation thatthis month's  policy discussion may go  like  last month's  policydiscussion.  [Laughter]  This  observation does  not  imply that we haveto cut  interest  rates  today.  It  certainly does  not,  and  I would notin  fact  argue  for  that.  But  it  does  strongly suggest  that  we need toease policy sometime,  especially if  there  is  a large  fiscalcontraction--and regardless  of  public  opinion  in Wooster,  Ohio  as  tothe  effects  of  fiscal  contractions  on  aggregate  demand.  Moreimportantly, it  suggests  that we  need to  think about  a long-termstrategy for monetary policy.  What we  do  today will have  essentiallynothing  to  do  with the next  two quarters.  But what we  do, notnecessarily today but,  say, in  the  coming six months,  is  likely tohave  a great  deal  to do  with how  the  economy looks  1-1/2,  2, 2-1/2years after  that,  and that's what we  ought  to  be  thinking about.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.9/26/95-33-

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?  Yes,  PresidentMelzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER. Don, I would like  to  ask about  these  sweepaccounts--a  couple  of  different  aspects.  One stems  from  an  inquirythat we had just  this  week  from a bank  in our District.  My sense  isthat knowledge  of  this  is  spreading  like wildfire through  the bankingindustry, and  I think banks  are  looking to  the  Fed to  take someposition on this;  they  are asking whether the  practice is  legal  and  soforth.  I presume somebody  is  out  there peddling the  idea,  or  thesoftware  that  supports it,  or whatever.  So,  one  question would bewhat can be  said about  these  arrangements  and maybe  this  discussionshould be continued  later  at  lunch  if  that  is more appropriate.  Myother question is  whether we  have  the  capability  to publish data that,without violating  any confidences  in  terms  of  individual  institutiondata, would give  the public a better handle  on what  is  going  on.Clearly, some people  are misinterpreting the  stance of monetary policybecause  they don't have  this  information.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  With regard  to  the  first  question, PresidentMelzer,  our Legal  Division has written  a number  of  letters  toinstitutions  that  have  inquired.  The  letters  lay out  the  criteria  fora sweep arrangement  that  conforms  with  our Regulation D.  Myunderstanding  from Reserve Banks  is  that many of  the  inquiring banksalready  have in  hand copies  of  the  letters  that  the Board's  LegalDivision has  sent  to  other banks.  So,  there  are  guidelines  out  therefrom our Legal  Division.  There has been an  attempt to  circumvent  theregulation with sweeps  that  are entirely sleight  of  hand bookkeeping.A bank has  to  have  a real  sweep account.  I don't know all  the  legalins  and  outs;  we  could explore  that  later if  you wanted  to.With regard to  the  second issue, we are  exploring that.  Iagree with you that  it would be good to  get these  numbers  out  somehow,but  there  are two  difficulties.  There  is  the  one  you mentioned:  ifwe publish a monthly series,  in some  earlier months and even  in  someearlier  quarters only one  bank or  two  banks had introduced suchaccounts.  Publication would give  information  to  their  competitors,and we  try to  avoid that.  That has not  been true  in  the  last  fewmonths when many banks have  introduced sweep accounts,  but  that wouldnot be  the  case  for  the  early part of  the  series.  I think there maybe ways we can publish the  series using quarterly  or  semi-annual dataat  first  or  something of  that  sort,  and we are  looking at  that.  Weintend  to publish.  The  second difficulty is  one  of  interpretation.All  we know are the  initial  impacts  of  these  sweeps;  that  is what  weget  through your data  departments, your accounting people,  and ouredit  checks.  We don't know what happens  subsequently, and  I think wehave  to  be  very careful  in looking at  these numbers  to resist  simplyadding them back  to M1  and assuming that we  are  getting what M1  wouldhave been  otherwise or what  the monetary base would have beenotherwise.  When we do put  the  series out,  I think we  need to  take a9/26/95-34-lot  of  care  in how it  is  put  out  and hopefully  lead people away  frommisinterpreting what  they have.  They need to  understand  the  verylimited nature  of  the  data  that we have, but we  are  looking  at ways  topublish  them.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Could it  be  a phenomenon that's  big enough thatwe  need to  collect  additional  data to  be  able to  interpret  itcorrectly?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We have given some  thought  to  that  as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There is  one  other aspect  in  theinterpretation of  these  data that we have  to be  careful  about.  Whileit  is  true  that  in  a technical  sense  these  accounts  are  changing, theyare not perceived to  be  changing by the  holders  of  the  accounts.  So,you can not  make  the  argument, which  some might make,  that what infact  is  engendering a change,  for  example  in M1  or  some  otheraggregate,  is  relevant in  terms  of  the  macroeconomic effect.  That  isnot  the  case,  or  should not be  the  case,  if  the  holders  of  theseaccounts  are not  aware  that  anything is  going on,  which indeed  theyare not  except  to  a marginal  extent.  So,  you can't  argue  that peopleare  holding certain types  of balances  voluntarily and acting on  thoseirrespective of  how those  balances  got created.  There  is  asignificant  lack  of  awareness among  the holders  of  the  accounts  thatreserve balance adjustments  are  taking place.  And they don't perceivethat  their NOW account has  gone down  or been  shifted  over to MMDAs  andtherefore  one  can't  argue  that  their behavior  should be  altered.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  they  are held harmless  from change.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Another part  of  the monetary base's  behavior, ofcourse,  is  that  currency and bank  reserves have been  declining for  agood while.  Currency was  growing very rapidly earlier,  but nowsomething  is  happening to  it.  Can you tell  us what  it  is  and whetherit  has any  implications  for anything?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  currency flows  to  foreign countries  haveslowed substantially.  We have  a lot  of  data on  the  flows,  but we  canonly guess  at  the  total.  The  shipments data we get  through  theFederal  Reserve  Bank of  New York  suggest  that  for  the  last  severalmonths  the  amount  of  currency outside  the  country has been  fairlysteady, and in  the  last  few months  it  may actually have  gone down withnet  shipments back to  the  United States.  Now, it  is  very hard tofigure out what  is  going on.  One  story, as  Ted just mentioned, isthat the  situation in  Russia has  stabilized to  a certain extent.  Itis  hard to  see  that  in  the  direct shipments  to  Russia,  but a lot  ofcurrency gets  to  Russia  through Switzerland and other  countries, andwe have seen  a slowdown there.  The  other area where we  have  seen aslowdown, and perhaps  I should turn  to  Ted and Peter  on  this,  is  inlower shipments  to,  or  even a reflow of  shipments  from, Latin America.For  a while we  thought we had an Argentina story--that  is,  that  therewere huge volumes  of  shipments  early in  the  year, partly after thefinancial  crisis  in Mexico,  in preparation for  something awful  thatwould happen  in Argentina.  The  something  awful never happened andsome of  that  currency came  back.  But  I think the  reflows  have beenwider than  just  those  from Argentina;  we  are getting  some  shipments9/26/95-35-back  from the  rest  of  Latin America.  In  summary, I think  an  importantpart  of  this  currency story has  been the  growth  in  shipments  abroadearly  in  the  year--a  lot  of  which were  to  Latin America  and shipmentsdestined ultimately to  Russia--and  the  slowing since  then.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further  comments?  If  not,  let me xeroxmy comments  from  the  last meeting because,  as  Governor Blinder pointedout,  a good thing  that  can happen to  somebody who  likes  to  talk aboutthe business  outlook  is  that  things  go  the way that you expected themto  go.  It  is  not usually  that way.  Let me just  point out,  however,something  that  has not been stated--namely,  that  economic  activity,income creation,  and  the  like  are  still  undergoing a suppressingeffect  from a reduction  in  inventory  investment.  It  is not  overlyclear  in  the  data, but as  you poke around here and there, it  is  prettyobvious  that  the pressure  to  reduce inventory-sales  ratios  is  stillout  there and  that the  retrenchment  or  stabilization of  lead  times  isexacerbating this  process.  It  is  not  sufficient merely  to  look atfinal  sales,  largely because  inventory numbers  are not passive.  Thereis  a dynamic element  involved in how  inventories  are  managed, and byaffecting  the  level  of  income  they also  affect  the  level  of  finalsales.  So,  we  do not yet have  a sense  of how all  this  is  coming out.There is  evidence  that  the probability of  continued weaknessis  receding.  This  is  not  inconsistent  with the  comment made byseveral  of  you  that  the  risks  are  on  the  down side.  It's  just  thatthe  downside  risks  are not  immediate;  they arise  as  we get  into  1996and are  the result  to  a certain extent of  the  fact  that the  businesscycle  is  aging.  To whatever extent  the  accelerator works  in  thecapital  goods markets,  one must  presume  that  that will  have  someslowing  effects.  And while I would have a minor quibble,  which I willget  to,  with Governor  Blinder's  scenario  of  the  federal  funds ratebeing higher  than where  the  long-term equilibrium should be--a  viewwith which  I generally  agree and one  that  I think you  have  allcommented  on  in  the past--I  would just  caution  that we  should be  alittle  careful  about  the use  of  the various models  out  there.  Torepeat what  I have  said in  the past  to  this  Committee,  those modelsgive  forecasts that  are marginally laughable  if  the  "add"  factors arenot  judiciously applied.  Simulations  of  these models  tend  to  employ afixed level  of  "add" factors  that  become  less and  less  usable  as  yougo  out  farther,  and we  have to  be  careful  about presuming that  thesesimulations are  any more accurate  in  capturing what  is  going  on  in theeconomy  than  "unattended" projections  of  these same models--unattendedmeaning  that  the  add  factors  are  just  allowed  to  run by somemechanical process.  Those  results  are poor and the  conclusions  thatwe would get  from simulations must  of  necessity be  of  the  same  nature.However, having said  that,  I think it  is  correct  to  argue that  we areprobably at  a real  funds  rate  level  that  is  higher  than the  long-termequilibrium.  I think the  argument  that  Governor Blinder makes--namely,  that we  get  a progressive  effect  in that  as  the  inflation  ratefalls  the  real  funds  rate  rises  even  though  the nominal  rates  holdsstable,  is  probably an accurate  description.  I just want to  makecertain  that we  don't  go overboard and assume  that  the simulations  wemake  are  all  that  useful  in this  regard.I think this  basically  leads  to  the  conclusion that  it  isprobably unwise to  move today essentially because of  the budgetdebates  that  are  involved.  I think  it  would be very difficult  for us,no matter how craftily we constructed  our rationale  for moving,  to9/26/95disassociate a move  from  the  train  wreck scenario.  There  is,  however,one  issue  about  this  that disturbs  me, which Don  Kohn raised.  We haveto be careful not  to  allow monetary policy  to be  frozen in place by aprocess  that could  go  on  for months  and months.  Policy  should notremain  frozen  if  we determine  that  the  economy is  in a state where wehave  to move.  I don't  know whether  that will be before  or  afterCommittee  is meeting--either here  or  on  a telephone  conference--because  the  move is  probably going to  be  a sensitive  issue.  So,  Iwould suggest  that  it  be done with the  Committee's  concurrence.As  far  as  our  decision today is  concerned, I would concludethat policy should be unchanged and symmetrical.  In my judgment,  itwould be wrong  to  move  today, and if  we are  to  take  action in  theperiod ahead it  should be  in the  context  of  considerable discussionabout  its  implications and the  decision should be made by the  fullCommittee.  So,  I put  on  the  table  "B" symmetrical.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  both yourconclusion  and the  reasons  that you  gave  for  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I, too,  support  your  conclusion and  the  reasonsthat you gave  for  it.  As  I said earlier,  I am drawn to  the view thatthe  economy  is  doing well both currently and prospectively.  So  interms  of prescriptions about policy, I look  to  the  old physicians'oath of  "do no  harm" and look at  "A",  "B",  and  "C" as  to where theharm would be done  if  we did anything right  now.  I think  it  would bemore  harmful  right now to  raise  rates  than  to  lower them.  Loweringthem may be the  next  action, but  I agree with  the  timing points  thatyou made.  I don't  think  that waiting  right  now, in view of  everythingthat  is  happening  on  the  fiscal  side,  prejudges whether  or not wewould wait  in the  future  if  the  budget  debates  really drag out.  So,  Iam comfortable with using  timing as  an argument right  now, although Ido  agree that  we should not  have our  hands  tied at all  as  to  futuremonetary policy actions.Finally, I would quote  some people  with whom I ate breakfastyesterday.  Their advice with regard to monetary policy was:  "Don'tjust move,  stand there."

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I agree with your proposal,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman, I hate  to  break the  trend thatseems  to  be developing here.  Your  argument  is  highly reasonable and Ihesitate  to disagree with you, but  I will anyway.  For many of  thereasons  that  have been advanced,  I think we  ought  to move and we oughtto  do  so  today.  First of  all,  we all  apparently agree  that  interestrates  are high by historical standards,  and  if  maintained  I think theyare  going  to be  contractionary in  the long  term.  Governors Yellen  andBlinder  have articulated that  theory very well.  There is  a trend thatis  building, and I think we  ought  to  arrest  it  at  this  point.9/26/95-37-In spite  of  the  fact  that we  have  a very  dynamic  economy inthe  Sixth District,  as  I indicated earlier,  there  are  business peoplewho are  reporting to  me  that  softness  is  beginning  to  develop.  So,the  economy may not be  in  as  good shape  as  the  statistics  areindicating.  Again, as  I said earlier,  the  Greenbook forecast  isplacing growth below what  is  currently considered to  be potential.  Ithink potential  is  higher  than  indicated  in  the Greenbook  andtherefore  that  the  gap between  actual  growth and what  I consider  thereal potential  of  the  economy  is  greater  than  that  in the  Greenbook.That might  give us  trouble down the  road.  Inflation  is  certainly wellbehaved and whether we  are at price stability or  not  I guess  is  amatter  of  definition.  But  I certainly  don't  see  any deterioration  inthe  inflation rate.  Finally, I think  the Fed's  credibility is  suchthat we  are in a position where we  can move  today.  Now, my preferencealong these  lines  is  irrespective  of  the  fiscal  situation, and  Icertainly respect your view regarding the  timing.  On  the  other hand,I do  think that  today may be  as  good a time as  any  to move.  It  may bea less  sensitive  time than  it  will  be  later.  So,  my preference wouldbe  to move  by 25  basis points  today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I think we adopted a strategyearlier this  year  to  wait and  see how things  play out.  I may havepreferred a different  strategy, but  I think that  one we  adopted  isreasonable.  Having  selected this  strategy, our tactics  should beconsistent with  it,  and in  my view what  you propose  is  consistent.  Ithink we  are  going  to  have  to  rethink  the  overall strategy,  though--ifnot at  the November 15th meeting  then  in  December as  we  learn moreabout  the  economy.  So,  I support your proposal  for  now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I support  "B" symmetric.  I think we  indeed haveto  take  into account  the  fiscal  side, but  I don't  know what  to  takeinto  account at  this  point.  So,  we  ought  to wait  on  that.  Almostsurely we will  have  to  adjust policy at  some point  in  coming months,but  I don't  sense  any pressing need today.  So,  I think your basicarguments  are correct and  I support them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I favor  "B" symmetric  as  well.  I viewpolicy as being somewhat restrictive,  and  I think that  is  quiteappropriate.  First  of all,  I think it  is  a hedge  against thepossibility that we have not  in  fact  capped  inflation in  this  cycle;  Ihope we have, but  I don't  think we  know that.  Secondly and perhapsmore  importantly, I would like  to  see  the  trend rate  of  inflation movedown and certainly more  quickly than  is  evidenced  in any of  theforecasts  that  I have  seen.  Perhaps when we  see  evidence  that  longer-term inflation expectations  in  fact  are moving down, rather  than theflat picture we are  looking at  now, it  might be  appropriate  toconsider an  easing, but  for  credibility  reasons  I would be verycareful  not  to  ease before we  saw some evidence  along  those  lines.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I agree with  your recommendationof  "B" symmetric.  The reasons  for me,  however,  are  that  I  think  theprojections  on  the  growth  of  the  economy are reasonably  accurate,  andas  I  said earlier  I am not quite  as  optimistic  about  the  inflationoutlook as  the Greenbook.  I think we  are  in a good policy position.As  for  the  fiscal  outlook,  though both  the  Greenbook and  our  ownprojections  view some  fiscal  restraint as  possible, we don't knowwhether  it  will be  more  or  less  than we  are assuming  and we won't  knowfor  some  time.  So,  I am very comfortable with where we  are  right now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I support your recommendation  forBluebook alternative  B.  I think we have  pretty solid evidence  thatthe  economy  is  growing at a  faster  rate  than  in  the  second quarter,andit  looks  as  though  the  economy is  going  to  continue  to grow at  anacceptable rate  in  the  future  as well.  Although we have  seen a modestfall  in  inflation  and a modest  increase  in the  real  funds  rate,  Idon't  think there  is  much evidence  that  inflation will  be  on  aat  this  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I support  "B"  symmetric.  We should have  someroom to  ease  sometime  this  fall,  but  I  think we  should wait  and seehow things  develop.  Symmetry  seems most  appropriate to  me, because  Ithink  it  is  clear  that  we probably would not move  in  the  intermeetingperiod without a  discussion.  It  seems  to me  that  if we were going  toadopt  an  asymmetric directive,  we should  definitely have  a move  inmind and  should only be  thinking  about  its  timing.  So,  I would gowith  "B" symmetric.

Isimply want to  state  as  a matter of  principle, one  that  most peoplebelieve  but a few have argued against,  that  fiscal policy  is  arelevant  consideration  in  setting monetary policy.  It  doesn't meanthat  we  have made  our policy hostage  to  fiscal  policy  in  any sense.But  it  is  true  that we don't  know what  the  fiscal  policy is  going  tobe.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The next  item on  the  agenda  is  SenatorConnie Mack's bill,  the  Economic  Growth  and Price Stability Act  of1995.  When  I reported to  the  Senate  Banking Committee  last week,  Iwas  not  asked very specifically whether  I supported  the bill  as  such.I repeated the  statements  I had made previously, namely  that  I thoughtthe primary purpose  of monetary policy was  long-term price  stability,and  I didn't get  queried much beyond that.  However, this bill  has  avery large  sponsorship.  Indeed, the  last  report  I heard  indicatedthat  virtually all  the  members  on  the Republican  side  of  the  SenateBanking and  on  the Joint  Economic  committees were  co-sponsors  of  thebill.  So,  it  strikes me  that we will  be asked  to  testify on  this billat  some point  or  another.  Despite  the  strain  of  the  currentlegislative  calendar,  it  is  likely that  Senator Mack will  besuccessful  in  squeezing  in a hearing  on his bill  at  some  point,  and itwould be  quite useful  to  get  at  least  preliminary views  from themembers  of  this  Committee on how we  should respond  to  that bill.  Iwill  be  testifying as  the  representative of  this  Committee  and of  theBoard, and  I will  try  to  fend off  wherever possible  any requests ontheir part  for my personal views.  It  strikes me  that  even  if  my viewscoincide in  all  respects  with what  this  Committee might be  saying,  theMack bill  involves  a potential  change  in  the  nature  of what thisCommittee  is  doing and it  is  the  Committee  that  should be  speaking inthat regard, not  the  Chairman.  A  lot  of  the provisions  of  this billessentially would sanction what we  have have  been doing  in any event,but  there  are  aspects  of  the  bill  that  are  different.  So,  I think  itis  important  that all  of  you,  to  whatever extent you have been able tofocus  on  the  provisions of  the bill,  at  least  give your preliminaryviews.  The  transcript  that we  will  have of  our  discussion will  behelpful  in  formulating official  testimony  in  response to  a request  forus  to  appear and  give  our views.  So,  if  anyone would  like  to  comment--President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, I believe  that  the  Mack bill  hasmuch  to  recommend it.  The  bill would  clarify our goals  and place  theprimary emphasis  on price  stability.  I also  like  the  fact  that  itrequires  a numerical goal,  which would add to  the public'sunderstanding of  monetary policy  and hopefully enhance  our credibilityover  time.  At  the  same  time,  the  bill  gives  us  the  freedom  to  definethe  numerical  inflation  goal  and the  timeframe  for  achieving  it.Finally, I like  the  fact  that  the bill removes  the  requirement  that  weestablish  and report  on  ranges  for  the  monetary aggregates,  which havebecome  only a minor part  of  our  deliberations.  Overall,  I think theMack bill would be a big  improvement on  Humphrey-Hawkins.

MR. BROADDUS.  I have  expressed my belief  that we needsomething  like  this  so  often  that  I am sure you don't  want  to hear  itall  again, and  I won't repeat my views  in  any detail  today. Briefly,I like  this  bill  very much.  I like  it both  in general  and withrespect  to  its particulars,  many of  which  Bob Parry just  covered.  Itcertainly is  true  that  we have made  a lot  of progress  in reducinginflation  over  the  last  decade and have done  so without  a mandate  likethis.  I think we have every right  to  be proud of  that  achievement,but  it  has not  been easy.  Basically, it  has been a game  of  trying, byboth our words and our  actions  to build and hold our credibility as  wehave gone  through this  period.  We have managed to build  credibility,no doubt about  it,  but  my  own instinct  is  that our  credibility is  not9/26/95-41-terribly deep  and that  it  rests  on a relatively fragile foundationthrough no  particular  fault  of  our  own.  I believe  Americans  shouldthink  about  these  issues.  Certainly, financial  market participantsare well  aware of  the  limits  to  the  Fed's  ability  to  pursue a pricestability objective in  the  current  institutional environment undercurrent  law.  Because  of  this,  I am not  sure we can  ever achieve  fullcredibility, or  even reasonably  full  credibility, under current  law.The best  evidence  of  that  is what  I often refer  to  as  the periodicinflation  scares  in  the  bond markets.  This bill  would help us  to  dealwith  this  credibility problem, and I certainly hope  the Committee  andthe  System will  vigorously support it.I would add just  one  other  point, Mr. Chairman.  Recognizingthat  the bill  even  with its  current political  support  still  facesuncertain prospects,  I would not want  to  see  us  tie  our  own longer-runstrategy too  firmly to  this particular bill.  In  particular, we stillneed  to  be  thinking about  how we will  deal  with the  Humphrey-Hawkinsreporting problem that we are going  to  face whether  this  bill passesor not.  We  discussed  that  problem a couple  of  meetings  ago.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Let  me begin by  saying that  there  is  a greatdeal  about  this  bill  that  I can endorse.  I think  the  focus  on pricestability as  the  single  appropriate  long-term goal  of  the  FOMC  iscorrect.  I endorse  the  repeal  of  the Humphrey-Hawkins Act.  I thinkthose numerical  target  reporting requirements  are  unrealistic  andcounterproductive.  I like the  idea that we  should be asked to defineprice stability and report  to  Congress  on how we  intend to  achieve  it.I like  the  bill's  recognition of  the  fact  that the  attainment of  pricestability  is  not costless  in  terms  of  transitional  losses  in  outputand employment,  and I like the  fact  that  it  explicitly directs us  totake  these  losses  into  account  in the  transition period.  So,  I thinkthis bill  moves us  in  a good direction.Having said  those positive  things,  I do  have  two qualms  aboutthis  bill.  The  first  is  that  it  does  not positively endorsestabilization policy  as  an  objective.  Its  tone  is  quite negative  andby inference  it  suggests  that  if  we  have just  one tool  of  policy wecannot  focus  on more  than  one  goal.  I have  said previously that  Ithink  that  stabilization  of  economic  activity is  an  important goal  inits  own right,  and  I think it  will  remain  so  even after pricestability  is  attained.  I recognize  that  one could make  the  argumentthat  the  actions that  are appropriate  to  stabilize  output andemployment  are  going  to coincide  with what  one  needs  to  do  tostabilize  the price  level,  namely, to  lean against  the wind.  Theproblem is  that  the world  is more  complex  than  that,  and these  twoobjectives will  not  always go hand  in hand.  There  are  apt  to  betradeoffs  between the  variability of  output around  its  trend and thevariability of  inflation around a level  of  zero.  That  does not meanthat  I reject  in any way the  natural  rate hypothesis.  So,  I think ourpolicy ought  to be  directed to  the pursuit  of  two  goals,  not one;  andas  I previously argued,  something along  the  lines  of  the  Taylor ruleprovides a formal way of  thinking  about how we could use policy  topursue multiple goals  without in any way sacrificing  the  goal  of  long-run price stability.  On  the  other hand, I do  agree with the  pointthat multiple  goals  have created uncertainty  in the  minds of  thepublic  and Congress  about  the  aims  of  monetary policy, and  I agree-42-with Alan Blinder  that  we need a systematic way of  clarifying what weare  doing.The  second concern  I have  is  that not  only does  this  bill notpositively  affirm a stabilization  objective,  it  actually repeals a keyportion  of  the  Employment Act  of  1946.  It  goes  much  further  than therepeal  of  the  Humphrey-Hawkins Act.  It  repeals  that part  of  theEmployment Act  that was  a declaration of  the  responsibility of  thegovernment.  I won't quote  the whole  thing, but  it  says  in part  thatthe  government  should  "use all  practical means... for  the  purpose ofcreating and maintaining  conditions which promote useful  employmentopportunities  for  those able, willing,  and seeking to work."  Thereare two  questions.  The  first  is  whether  the  Employment  Act of  1946has  implications  for  the  Federal  Reserve.  One might  say that  this  Actis  just  a declaration  of  government policy and that  it  has  no  specificmeaning  for us  whatsoever.  A little bit  of  legal  research that  we didsuggests  that  that  is  not  the  case.  We uncovered a 1971 memo  from theBoard's  General  Counsel,  Mr. Hackley, who wrote,  "The declaration  ofCongressional  policy set  forth  in Section  2 of  the  Employment Actunquestionably applies  to all  agencies of  the  federal  governmentincluding  the  Board, since  the  Board as well  as  the  Federal  Openbeen expressly recognized by three  Federal Reserve  Board chairmen--Chairman McCabe,  Chairman Martin, and Chairman Burns.  What Mr.Hackley concluded was  that  this broad mandate  certainly did govern  thegeneral  policies of  the Board, although we  did not have  the  specificobligation to  pursue  the  particular goals  set  out  in  the  EconomicReport  to  the  President.  So,  I think it  does  have  implications  forthe  Board, and even  if  the  Employment Act of  1946  had no  implicationsfor  the  Federal  Reserve at  all,  I would oppose  repeal  of  this  featureof  the  Employment Act because  it  has  implications  for  the  federalgovernment more broadly.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan, in  the  ten years  that  I have been directlyinvolved in  this process,  this has  to be the  most  significantpotential  institutional  development  that  I have seen come  forward.Needless to  say,  from what  I have  said in  the past  this  bill  issomething  that  I would strongly support.  I think price  stability isthe  appropriate  focus  for  the  FOMC  and the  Federal  Reserve moregenerally.  It  is  the one  thing we can deliver  in  the long run.  Thatis  where we ought  to be  focused, and if  we do it  successfully,  it  isgoing  to enhance  the performance of  the real  economy, and it  is  goingto  result  in  lower  longer-term rates.I like  the way this bill  is  structured in  terms  ofarticulating the  general  focus  and leaving  the  details  to  the  centralbank.  Clearly, a lot  of work and thinking would have  to be done  toimplement  this bill,  and it  would not  be easy, but  the  structure  isquite  appropriate  in  terms  of having  a direction set  by  legislationand giving us  the  opportunity to  focus  on  the  details  of how to getthat  done.  I think a numerical  definition of  price stability  is  veryimportant  from a credibility point  of view.There probably are  some  things  in  the language  of  the billwhere we want  to  consider certain  technical  modifications.  In  someplaces,  the  bill  talks  about  the  Board and in  other places  it  talks9/26/95-43-about  the  Board and the  FOMC.  One would have  to  ask  in  the  context ofmonetary policy whether  some  reference  to  the Reserve  Banks  needs  tobe  in  there  as well  because  of  the  role  of  the  Reserve Bank boards  ofdirectors  in  setting  the discount  rate.  In  any event,  I think thebill needs  consistency  in  terms  of  how that  sort  of  thing  isdescribed.  Don Kohn mentioned in his  briefing that  there was  someambiguity in  the  bill's  language  with respect  to  our  taking intoaccount  the  tradeoff  between output  and  inflation.  The way I read thelanguage,  it  implied a tradeoff during  the  initial  transition period.That  is  not an  unimportant  issue  in terms  of  credibility.  If  thatwording  is  read in effect  as  giving us  latitude  to  engage  in  short-term  fine-tuning on an  ongoing basis,  I think that  is  going toundercut  our  credibility and will  remove  some of  the  value  that  isinherent  in an approach like  this.I have  just  two  final  thoughts.  As  I said, a lot  of work  isnecessary prior to  implementing  this  legislation.  I don't disagreewith what Bob Parry said about  removing the  obligation  to report  onmonetary targets, but  I think we  ought  to  recognize  that if  our  long-term objective has  to  do with prices,  there  is  no  way around  the  factthat  inflation is  a monetary phenomenon.  We  have  to  focus  on what  ishappening  with our balance  sheet,  how that  influences money, and howmoney relates to  inflation.  There may be  implications  of  a veryfundamental  nature in  terms  of how we  think about what we  do  or  atleast  in  terms  of what  we  look  at  in doing  it.  Finally, I agree withwhat Al  Broaddus  said with respect  to  not  tying ourselves  strictly tothis bill.  We  need to  think about how we  can continue to  reapbenefits  from the  course  that we have been on  and what  steps we  cantake to  enhance our  credibility  further.  One idea  that  has beenkicked around in  this  room has  to  do with longer-run  forecasts  ofinflation.  There  are  things  like  that  that  I think would be  veryhelpful  in communicating  our longer-term  intentions even  in  theabsence of  a bill  like  this.  The  reason I think  this  is  so  important,frankly, is  that  it  is  very hard to  quibble  in a general  sense withthe  performance of monetary policy  in the  1980s  and  the  1990s,  but  inmy opinion  that has  had everything  to  do with  the people  around thetable  and particularly the kind  of  leadership we have  had.  It  hasvery  little  to  do with  the  sort  of  direction we  are given  in  theinstitutional  structure.  I guess  I view the  latter  as  a verydangerous  situation in  terms  of  the potential  for  the  future.  Wecould revisit  the  1960s  and the  1970s very easily with  a differentperspective  in terms  of  leadership and membership.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  In many ways  the Mack bill  conforms  to  how wehave carried  out policy  in recent years.  So,  I see  it  as  legislationthat  is  catching up with  the  experience and  the progress.  There aresome  advantages  to  the  bill.  I think it  is  useful  to  formally makeprice  stability the primary objective  over  the  long  run.  The properway to  look at  it  from my point  of view is  that price  stability  is  ameans to  an  end, not an  end in  itself.  The ultimate end  of alleconomic policy is  higher standards  of  living  and growth and that  sortof  thing.  So,  as  we explain  our role,  and I think  the Mack bill  doesthis, we  need to  focus  on price  stability as  the  primary objective butas  a means to  a larger end.  I also  like  the  flexibility that  the Mackbill gives  the  FOMC  in  the pursuit  of  this  longer-term  objective.  Itrealistically allows us  to  take  into  account  short-run  factors  like9/26/95-44-fluctuations  in demand, recessions,  financial  shocks,  etc.,  but  theshort-run  actions  need to  be  anchored in  this  longer-run objective.In  other words, whatever we  do  in  the  short run ought  to  be  consistentwith  this  longer-run  objective,  and I think the  Mack bill  does  give usthat  latitude.  It  does  open  up  the  question of what  the  strategy is.It  is  easier  on paper  to  explain  that we  are going  to move  towardstable prices  year after year until  we  get  there.  In practice,  Ithink we have  to  take  into  account  the business cycle  in  gettingthere.  We  got  ourselves  into  this  inflationary problem cycle  tocycle.  We  have gotten out  of  it  marginally cycle  to  cycle,  takingadvantage  of  cyclical  developments.  So,  as we go  forward, if  thisbill  becomes  legislation, we  need  to  take  into account  the  cycle-to-cycle progress even  though it  can be  more difficult  to  explain.  So,as  a general proposition,  I would  support  the  thrust  of  this  proposedlegislation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  This  bill  came out  of  the  hopper vastly betterthan  I and many other people  expected.  Nonetheless,  I find  I can'tsupport  it  as  it  is.  Let  me explain why very briefly because  in  somesense  I can  say,  "Please read Governor Yellen's  remarks  into  therecord  a second  time."  She  got  to  go  first,  so  I'll  be very short.I, too, would prefer  a much more  symmetric  treatment,  or I guess  Ishould say, in  light  of  what  Ed Boehne  was  just  saying,  explicitrecognition of  the stabilization  role  of monetary policy.  There  isnothing whatever wrong  about the  phrase that  says  the  "primary long-term goal"  is  price stability.  In  fact,  it  is  one hundred percentright.  That  is  what we do now.  It's  exactly correct,  and  I amperfectly happy with that  in the  law.  You might even  argue that  it  isthe  only  long-term goal;  I am not  sure what  else we  can do  in  the  longterm.  But,  in the  short  term,  there are  other goals.  I am worriedabout  the  applicability of  the  "taking account"  phrase  that  Donmentioned,  just as  Tom Melzer was  worried about  it--but  for theopposite reason.  It  looks  ambiguous  to  me  the way it  is  dangling inthe  bill.  I would  like  to  see  the  ambiguity removed, as would Tom,but  in the  opposite direction.The  reporting  accountability aspects,  I agree,  are  a vastimprovement over what we have  in  Humphrey-Hawkins.  I don't have  anyreal problem with them except  that  I would like  to point out  onething, which  is what  Don Kohn pointed out  in  jest  just  a while  ago.But  for me  it  is  not  in  jest.  We have  a choice under this  bill  ofreporting  to  the Banking committees  that  the answer  is  "one or  twomore  recessions"  or,  say,  of  giving  them a 5-year projection  in whichwe  have enough  slack to  put  in,  depending on  the  definition  of pricestability, say 4 point years  of  unemployment  above  the  natural  rateover  the next  5 years.  Now, if  we want  to  live with that  or  do  that,that's okay.  I think  that  is  a debatable proposition.  I am notnecessarily negative about  it,  but we  ought  to  realize  that,  in  thecourt of  educated public  opinion, we will  not be  able  to  get away withan airy-fairy forecast  that  says  that  everything will  be perfect and,in particular, that  full  utilization of  resources  will be maintainedas  inflation  tracks  down to  zero.  We  just won't.  So,  we  ought to  gointo  that process with  our eyes  open.I think  that could be  done,  and  I think almost all  the othermandates  in the bill  could be  done.  However,  the  killer provision for9/26/95-45-me  is  the  line  in  there that  abolishes  the  Employment Act  of  1946.  Iam  simply unalterably opposed to  that;  I could never,  ever  support anybill  that has  that  as  a clause.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  In general,  I am  in  favor  of  this  legislation.  Ithink it  is  the  right  direction  to  move  for  the  reasons  that  a numberof people,  including Ed Boehne,  cited.  This will  get  us  toward ourlargest  contribution to  economic prosperity over  time.  Having  saidthat,  I would agree--this may seem unusual--with both Tom  and Alan.If  we  start  thinking  about the  implementation  issues,  they are ratherdaunting.  As  Don Kohn mentioned, this  would join  the issue  of  whetherwe  really want  to  achieve price  stability in  an  opportunistic  sense  orwhether we want  to  go with  something  like alternative C irrespectiveof  how things  stand at  the moment.  My judgment would be  that  therewould be no  escaping those  kinds  of  questions  if  this  legislation wereput  in place.  So,  I think that  would likely be  a very challengingenvironment.  That  does  not mean that  we should not  go  this  route,  butI do  think some  issues  that we  have been able  to  finesse  in recentyears will  be  joined rather directly if  we  go  down this path.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman, I am pretty much where Gary Sternwas  but maybe  in terms  that are  a little  different.  I certainlysupport the  thrust  of  this  bill  unequivocally in  that  it  gives primacyto price  stability as  a means  toward  a larger  end.  But  I am nottotally comfortable with virtually any hard-wired legislation  that  Ican  think  of,  even with  legislation that  is  as  flexible  as  this billappears  to  be.  The good news  is  that  it  is  consistent  with what wehave been doing, what we  foresee we would  like to  do,  and iteliminates  the  onerous provisions  of  Humphrey-Hawkins.  I am a littleconcerned  that over  time,  in  ways  that we can't  foresee, we might  verywell have  some combination  of  economic  and possibly politicalcircumstances  that  could inhibit  us  in  the pursuit of  an appropriatemonetary policy if  this  legislation were  in place.  The alternativewould be  to  get us  back  into  a situation where we might have  a lawthat we  would have  to  ignore as  we  have  ignored certain aspects  of  theHumphrey-Hawkins  law for  very good reasons.  I think  ignoring a lawthat  remains on  the books  over  a long period of  time  is  completelyunacceptable,  and I would hate  to remain  in  that  situation in  thecontext of  new legislation.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I support  the  thrust  of  this billand most  of  the  specifics.  I agree with  the premise  on which thisbill  is  based, and that  is  that by promoting  long-term price stabilitymonetary policy supports  long-term economic  stability as well.  So,given that premise  and given  that belief,  I support the  bill.  I alsothink  that  the proposed bill  does give  us  flexibility in  terms  of  theshort-term effects  of  our policy and  it  gives us  room to  maneuvergenerally.  I would  like to  see more  specific  language  that  takes  intoaccount  supply shocks  or  other  factors.  One can rationalize doingthat with the proposed language,  but  I would  feel more comfortable  ifthose  types  of  shocks were specifically recognized in  the  legislationto give us  a little more wiggle  room in  terms  of  policy actions  that9/26/95-46-we might need  to  take  in the  short  term.  But otherwise  I do  supportthe  thrust  of  this  bill  very much.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Well,  like  everyone else  I think  that  the  ideathat price stability ought  to  be  the  long-term goal  of  the  centralbank  is  completely consistent with the  contributions  a central bankcan make  to  economic growth over  the  longer  run.  But  the  autopilotaspects  of  this  legislation  really worry me.  It  may be that  some  ofthe  language will  permit  us  to  finesse  all  of  that,  and the billcertainly would  allow us  to  set  the  details  rather  than have writtenin law  that we  must report  on  a set  of  data  that seems  to be  importantat  one point in  time but may not  be  at  another.  I think  it  is  quitehelpful  to  have  some  options  in  terms  of  the  details  in  achieving thislonger-run goal.  But  I have some  concerns on  the  opposite side  fromTom Melzer.  Frankly, I think we have  done a good  job over  the  1980sand the  1990s precisely because the  institutional  setup has  allowedpeople  of  some wisdom, arguably less  or even more  from  time  to  time,to  take  the  right  actions given a variety of circumstances  that wereimpossible  to  know or  to  forecast  at  the beginning of  the  1980s.  Theidea  of  single-mindedly approaching  something through  several  businesscycles  in  a way that has  some  autopilot  aspects  to  it  gives meconcern.  It  may be  that  the  language  allows more  flexibility thanthat  and the  reality will be  less onerous  than  that,  but  it  reallyconcerns  me.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman,  I have  felt  for  a long timethat Humphrey-Hawkins was  outdated and needed  to be  revised, and Iexpressed  that  opinion in  this Committee  several  times.  I think  thisbill  is  a vast  improvement  over Humphrey-Hawkins,  but  I have some  ofthe  same  concerns  that were  expressed by a number  of  people, notablyGovernor Blinder  and Governor Yellen.  Clearly,  the  responsibility andthe  objective  of  a central  bank in  the  long term  should be pricestability.  But  this bill does  not  emphasize  the  other  aspects  of  thecentral bank's  responsibility, namely economic  stabilization, to  theextent that  I would like.  To the  degree  that  this bill  is  codifyingwhat we have  been  doing, I ask the  basic  question:  Why do  we need it?I just  don't  think this kind of  thing should be enshrined inlegislation.  I am a little  concerned about  the  view that  the  languagecan be  finessed.  That  is  not what  we  ought  to  be  doing with thestatutory  language.  We  should not  be  in that  kind of position.  TheCommittee has  been operating  for several  years  toward  the goal  ofprice  stability, and I think any Committee group, however  it  isconstituted, would have  the  same  goal.  Again, I come  back to  thefundamental  threshold  question I have had from  the beginning:  Whyhave  the  bill  at  all?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, we  currently seem  to have  theluxury of  a great  deal  of  flexibility because  the goals  establishedfor  the  Committee  are ambiguous  and  in some  cases  contradictory.  ButI think we  are moving past  that point.  Once  this  issue  is  raised  tothe  level  of  a serious discussion with hearings and so  on, we  aregoing to  have  to  change.  We have been in  the  process of  becoming much9/26/95-47-more  accountable in  terms  of  the  announcements  that  we make after eachmeeting, in  terms  of  the publication of  the  transcripts, and our  moreopen  disclosure process  generally, and  I support all  of  those  things.But  the world clearly  is  changing,  and  there  is  increasing pressure  onus  to  clarify our  longer-term objectives.  So,  I support  the  thrust  ofthis bill,  although I have  one major caveat.  I like  the  fact  that  itrepeals  the Humphrey-Hawkins bill.  My reaction at  the  time it  wasenacted was  that members  of  Congress voted  for  it  mostly because  ofemotional  ties  to  Hubert Humphrey, not because  they really  supportedwhat  the bill  actually said.  I like the  emphasis  on price stability.I think  it  is  clearly,  as Governor Blinder  said, our primary objectiveand where  we have  the  most  impact.  I like  the  flexibility that  thebill  would give us.  If  we go  down this  road, I think  it  is  writtenabout as  well  as  we  could expect  it  to  be  written.  It  can provide  amajor public  education role  for  us  as  well,  an opportunity  for us  toeducate the public.  In  that  respect,  I think it  will  have a usefulside benefit.The  caveat is  the  repeal  of  the  Employment Act  of  1946.  Imust confess  that  I haven't  reread the Act,  and I have to  go  back andreread  it now since  Governor Yellen raised this  as  a point.  But  ingeneral  I support  the  thrust  of  the Mack bill.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I am not  sure  this  issue  is  ready for primetime.  Certainly, the  intent  of Senator Mack  and his co-sponsors  isthe very desirable goal  of  clarifying the  role  of  economic policy andespecially the  role  of  monetary policy.  But  it  is  not  obvious to  methat that  is  going to  be  the outcome of  the  hearings process.  Twoyears after we ended Bretton Woods  in 1973,  people went  to instrumentmonitoring--monetary growth  targeting--as a sort of  interim device  totry to  set  the  boundaries  for what economic  policy, monetary policy  inparticular,  was supposed to do.  I think that  approach has  certainlyrun  its  course, and  it  is  time  to  move on  to  objective monitoring--toset  an objective  and initiate a process  of  oversight  to  see how wellwe  do  in  achieving the  objective.Listening to  some  of  this  discussion, however, just  enhancesmy concerns about what  will happen  in the  hearings.  We will have  alot of  very well  respected, well-known academic,  Wall  Street, andother private-sector economists  appearing  before  the Congressionalcommittees.  And instead  of educating  the members  of  the  Senate andthe House--and through them maybe  the American public  a little--aboutthe  contribution  that  a stable  currency can make toward the  fullemployment  goal of  the  Employment Act  of  1946,  they will  speak mostlyabout  the notion that  stabilizing  the value  of  the currency depends  onmaintaining a minimum army of unemployed, or maintaining  slack, orholding growth below some  notion of potential.  As  I read thelegislation,  I think it  does not  repeal  the  full  employment goal  ofthe  Employment Act  of  1946;  in  fact,  the  Mack bill  clarifies  that  goalin very clear  terms.  It  says  in Section  2, Paragraph 8, that pricestability  is  a key condition  to  maintaining the highest  possiblelevels  of productivity, real  incomes,  living standards,  employment,and global  competitiveness.  Under  the  statement of  policy, the  billsays  that an  environment  conducive  to both long-term  economic growthand  increases  in  standards  of  living  is  fostered by establishing andmaintaining  free markets,  low taxes,  respect  for private property, and9/26/95-48-the  stable  long-term purchasing power of  the  currency.  So,  I thinkthat  the  intent  of  the  legislative wording  is  that  the  contribution  ofmonetary policy toward achieving  the  goals  originally  set  out  in  theEmployment Act almost  fifty years  ago  is  to  stabilize  the  value of  thecurrency.  I simply am afraid  that  that  is not  what people would behearing  from a lot  of  our colleagues  in  the  economics  professionbecause  they have  a different  model  in mind.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder and then  Don Winn.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  To  clarify what  I said, if  you read the  fineprint,  there  is  a section  in  the  bill  that calls  for  the  repeal  ofoutmoded or  obsolete provisions,  or  something  like  that.  One  of  themis  Section 2 of  the  Employment Act.  That's why  I said what  I said.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  I spoke with one of  Senator Mack's  staff  yesterdayafternoon with respect  to  the  hearings  schedule,  asking what  thelikelihood was.  I got no  specific  answer  to  that  question.  But  inthe  course  of  the  conversation,  I did bring up  this  issue with him asto what  their  intent was  in  terms  of  the  Employment Act  of  1946.  Hadthey intended to wipe out  the  employment  objectives  of  the  EmploymentAct?  The  impression  I got was  they had not  realized that  they hadeliminated the  "maximum employment"  objectives of  the  1946 Act.  Theirresponse was  that  they had intended  to  repeal Humphrey-Hawkins and  thevarious  aspects  of  the Humphrey-Hawkins Act  that  amend the  EmploymentAct  of  1946  as well  as  the  Congressional Budget Act;  they had intendedto  take  out  those pieces  from  the  Employment Act  of  1946.  On theother hand,  they also  said that  they had substituted new policyobjective  language, which  I think  is  on  the  bottom of  page  3 in  thecopy  of  the  bill  that  I circulated.  I mentioned to  them  that  therewas no reference  to  employment  in  that provision, which relates  to  theobjective of  price stability, and it  appeared that  they had notrealized that.  They seemed to  indicate  that  that had been anoversight  on  their part.  There  is  some  indication that  they would bewilling to  make  some  changes.  Of course,  I was  speaking with only onestaff person;  I don't know how representative that  conversation was  ofthe  views on  the Hill.By the way,  on  the hearings  issue,  they  really have notplanned what  they are going  to  do next.  They could have more hearingsin  the Joint Economic  Committee  or  in  the  Senate Banking  Committee;the  timing really has not been decided.  I asked  if  there  is  alikelihood of  a hearing before  the  end of  the year.  They said thereis  a distinct possibility of  that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I support  the  Mack Bill.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman McDonough.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I think the  singlemost important  thing  about  the bill  as proposed is  probably that  itrepeals  Humphrey-Hawkins.  I, like Governor Kelley, am very opposed tohaving  statutes  on  the books  that we  are supposed to  be  following  andthat we  cannot  follow.  I think  that maintaining such legislationcreates  something  of  a contempt  for  law in  society, which is  verycounterproductive.  I believe  that  long-term price  stability is  the9/26/95-49-appropriate  goal  of  monetary policy.  But  monetary policy with  long-term price  stability as  a goal  is  really a means  to  achieve an  end,which is  maximum sustained economic  growth and maximum  creation ofemployment.  I know that  I have  on  occasion caused  some eyes  to  cloudover when I have  expressed the  view that  the  reasons  for  that  are  atleast  as  strongly social  and political  as  they are economic.  I thinka democratic  society is  not  stable by  its  very nature, but  rather thatit  can be made  stable  if  the  people in  the  country  feel  that  theyreally have  a reasonable  opportunity  for  a better  life  ahead.  We needsustained  economic growth  to  do  that.  Therefore,  price stability  is  awonderful  thing, but  as  a means  to  an  end, not  an  end in  itself.It  follows  that  I do not have  any particular interest  inassociating myself, nor  do  I think we  should associate  the FederalReserve, with  the  hair-shirt school  of price  stability--namely, thatprice  stability is  such a wonderful  thing  that we  should achieve it  atwhatever the  cost to  society.  I share  President Jordan's  concernabout  some of  the  nonsense that  one  could hear  at committee  hearingsfrom people who do believe  that,  and  I would be worried  about  theeffect  that  they could have on  the  general  societal view of whatmonetary policy is  all  about,  since  I think that  would get  the moreexciting headlines.  I think that  the best  legislation would say thatthe  goal  is  to achieve price stability and would leave  the definitionof  price stability up  to  the  central bank.  It  would not  ask thecentral bank  to define  price stability numerically from  time  to  time.I think we would have  great difficulty in  doing that  in  a reasonableway and still  have  the  flexibility  that we  need to  deal with  thebusiness  cycle and with external  shocks.  It  also would  create anabsolute  zoo  for the people who  are  of  the  hair-shirt  school  to  appearnot  just once  while  the bill  was being considered, but  semiannually.It  is  likely that  after  the  Chairman concluded his  testimony, he  wouldbe  followed by a group of  learned  types whose  opinions  on whethertheir view of  the numerical  goal  for  inflation  was better  than ourview of  the  numerical goal  would be  given almost equal  weight  at  leastby some members  of  the  Banking committees.  I think that  would be aterrible  contribution  to public policy.So,  I am  in favor  of  the  bill, but  I would like  the  bill  tomake  it  even  more clear,  although it  does make  it  reasonably clear,that price stability  is  a means  to  an end.  I don't  like  therequirement  that  the  Federal Reserve  establish moving numerical  goalsfor  the  level  of  prices.  I also would want  to  improve the  language tomake it  clear that  the  Federal Reserve  does  include twelve FederalReserve Banks  and that  the  boards of  those  Banks  have a role  to  playin the  formulation of  monetary policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I generally  support the  thrust  of  the bill.  Ithink  that  it  is  useful  to  clear  out  some  of  the  clutter  in thecurrent Humphrey-Hawkins Act.  One  of  the major positives  of  the billis  the  clear  focus  on price  stability and  the purchasing power of  ourcurrency.  But  I, too,  would like to  see  a recognition that  this  focusis  not  inconsistent with  economic growth.  In  fact,  this  is howmonetary policy specifically can  contribute to  economic growth.  Ilike  the  at  least perceived flexibility  that  is  in  the  bill  in  termsof  calling upon us  to  develop  definitions  and to  construct  therequired reports.  I think a great  deal  of  work would need to be  done9/26/95-50-on  our part  to  figure  out  how we would want to  structure  thesereports.  Perhaps  we should give  some  thought as  to how muchclarification we want up  front  or how  loose  we want  to make  it.  I,like  others,  am concerned about  this  question as  to  how  tightly wewould be wired to  price  stability at  all  costs  and whether  we wouldhave  the  flexibility to  make adjustments  to  business  cycles  and supplyshocks.  I do  support  the  thrust  of  the  bill,  but  I hope  that  we  canpreserve a good deal  of  flexibility  to manage policy depending on  thecircumstances.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Everyone here  dislikes Humphrey-Hawkins--goodriddance--and we basically like  long-term price  stability.  What wealso  don't  like  is  having  legislation defining what we  should do.Frankly, I think  the  crux  of  the  issue comes back  to  that.  We couldwish that  the  Congress  of  the  United States, which created  thisinstitution, would stay away and not give  us  instructions.  That's notgoing to  happen.  Given that's not  going  to  happen, we  are going  toget  legislation  telling us what  to do.  What  is  that  legislation goingto  say?  At worst  it  produces some  horror  like  Humphrey-Hawkins;  atbest  it  produces  something  like  the bill  we have  before  us.  It  is  notideal.The  key here  is  that we  get  to  define and redefine what  ismeant  by price  stability.  For  example, one issue  is  the  time periodover which we  are measuring prices.  Questions  have  been raised aboutsupply shocks, and  I agree  that  is  a concern.  Do we mean  that  the CPIhas  to be  reported at  0.0  every month?  Certainly not.  Or even  0.0  ina year?  Certainly not.  The  goal  is  long-term price stability.  Theother  issue  is  what price measure do  we use.  Here  I am going  to goback  to  the misfortune  that a good Virginia boy  like me  had in  theFirst District.  We had something  called  the Massachusetts miracle.Now, I bet  that  the  CPI  for Massachusetts,  if we  had such a thing, wasnot much different  from  the national CPI  and was pretty stable.  Buteveryone knew the  New England economy wasn't  stable;  we had a bubblegoing on.  In retrospect,  that's obvious.  I don't  know why ourdefinition of price stability  in the  report would not  include  sectoralmonitoring.  If  we  observe bubbles occurring  in  the  economy we knowthat  they are destabilizing, no matter what  the price level  might be,and ultimately inconsistent with long-term price  stability.  I reallydon't  see how our hands  are being  tied.  If we  are allowed  to defineand redefine what we mean by price  stability, what measure  we  arelooking  at,  and over what  time  horizon we are  focusing--and given  thatCongress will  not  go  away--I  think we have gotten  the best deal  thatwe  can get.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  Don Winn, did you want  to  sayanything further  on  this  that you haven't  communicated already?

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  You made  the  point earlier  that  in  terms  ofsupport  for  this  legislation  it  appears  that all  of  the majoritymembers of  the  Senate Banking Committee and the JEC  seem  to have  linedup behind this bill.  A committee  staffer  told me  that  after yesterdaythey also  have as  sponsors  the  Chairman of  the  Senate FinanceCommittee,  the Chairman of  the  Senate Budget  Committee,  and all  of  themembers of  the  Senate Republican leadership.  So,  at  least  in terms  ofsupport on  one  side  of  the  aisle, they  feel  that  they have key members9/26/95-51-of  the  Senate  supporting the  legislation.  Now,  obviously the  detailof  the  sponsors'  knowledge  of  this  bill  is  something that  has  to  beconsidered.  But  in  terms  of  an  initial  push  for  this  legislation,Senator Mack and his  staff  are  quite pleased by the  response  they havegotten  so  far.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Have  you had any input  from  the Administrationrecently?

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  We have not heard anything.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't  think you will  unless  it  looksas  though  it  is  a bill  that has  legs.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  There clearly will be  opposition from  someimportant  Senators  on  the  Democratic  side.  Senator Sarbanes probablywill  not be  supportive  of  this  legislation.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think that  Governor Lindsey  raisedan  important point  in his  last  comments  on the  issue  of  flexibility.When Don Winn and  I have  talked to  Hill  staffers  and asked them  aboutthis  issue,  one of  the major points  they make is  that  the  Fed  isdefining price stability and defining  the  conditions under which youare  getting there.  Certainly, they would expect you  to  tell  them  ifthere  is  an adverse  supply shock, so  that  getting there might  bedelayed.  They viewed  the provisions  cited by Governor Lindsey  asaffording  us  flexibility.  When  I asked about the  sentence,  "theCommittee  shall  take  into  account the potential  short-term effects"and what it  was meant  to  apply to,  I was  told  that  it was pretty muchdeliberately ambiguous.  They were  trying to  cut  between certainfactions  that  they were dealing with.  They could see  that  the  literalwording did not  apply just  to  the  transition period, but  the  sentencestill  could be read as  applying to  the  transition period because  ofwhere it  was  in  the  bill.  I think  their view was  that  the FederalReserve would have quite  a bit  of  flexibility under  this  legislation,although  they admitted that wasn't unambiguous.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That  is  the  concern  that  I had.  If  you readthe  language  in  that paragraph absent  the  comments  of  theCongressional staffers,  you do  get  the  sense  that we have  this  one-time  transition period during which we could take  these  factors  intoaccount.  After that,  it  is  like a cruising 747;  we  don't  touch  thecontrols.  Isn't  that  kind of  language something  totally unrealisticand unresponsive  to  the  success  that we have  had over  the  last  10  or15  years?  It  is  hard to  understand, given  the  success that  almosteveryone  thinks  that monetary policy has achieved, why we need  thisnow.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I think that  may be  spelled out  in  the  reportlanguage.  A bill  has  to  be  short  and understandable.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I am not  suggesting that this  one  is notunderstandable in  terms  of  its  long-run  intent.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I don't  think clarifying  it  in  the  legislationis  the  way to  go.  The ambiguity is  best  left  to  the  report  language.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Ambiguity  is  necessary for  flexibility.9/26/95-52-

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  That's  true,  but  this bill  seems  to  have  lessambiguity in  the  sense  of  that  paragraph really referring  to  thetransition period.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I must  say that  I didn't read  it  that way.  Iread  it  that  we had  flexibility during  the  transition and that we hadflexibility  thereafter.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  I agree.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  If  flexibility  is  the objective,  then ultimateflexibility would be not  to  have any  legislation  at  all.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That will never happen!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  getting quite  late.  [Laughter]Why don't we  adjourn this meeting?  If  you want  to  have  an informaldiscussion later  today on  these  issues  after Don Winn brings  us  up  todate on overall  legislative  developments, we  can do  that.  I thinkthis  has been a very useful presentation by all  of  you.  It  clearlysuggests  to me  the  sort  of  language we  can put together  for  thehearing should such  a hearing take place.  Obviously, the drafttestimony will  be  circulated to  you in advance.  Finally, let  me  justsay  that our next  meeting  is  Wednesday, November 15th.  It  promises  tobe  an  exciting meeting not because  of what we will  do  but because  ofwhat  other people will  do  at  that  time.
