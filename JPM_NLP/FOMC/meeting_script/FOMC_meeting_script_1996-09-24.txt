CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody like  to  move approval  ofthe minutes?  Bob,  I know the  San  Francisco District  is  three hoursbehind us,  but I think you are  going to  have  to move  their approval.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I would like  to  move!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection, the minutes  areapproved.  Peter  Fisher.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions  for  Peter?Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Concerning  the French budget,  it  appears  thatthe French  got  from here to  there with asset  sales.  Of  course, thebudget is  a very flexible document,  but  one would think  that assetsales  would be a little  suspect by the  terms  of  Maastrict.  Why is  theEuropean Monetary Union  going to bless  this?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It  remains  an  issue under Maastrict, and I thinkthe answer  is  politics.  It's  not  settled yet,  but  it  appears  to  beheaded that  way.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  To put  the market's  reaction in a nutshell,  Ithink the market  is  focusing on  the question of whether  thepoliticians can pull  a rabbit out  of  the hat.  Maybe they can.  Havinga commission  in  Brussels  bless the  French budget  is  one aspect  of  howthe politicians may be  able  to  do  that.  The markets  are  not going  tounderestimate the  ability of  the politicians.  Those who  arepositioning  in  the expectation  that  EMU will  implode fear  that  thepoliticians  may pull  a rabbit  out  of  a hat  and when they  see  somethinglike  that  happening,  they back up and reassess  the question ofspeculating against  the  EMU.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  So,  the  markets are  saying that  the  triumph  ofpolitics  over  economics  is  a good  thing?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. In the  short  run,  it  may work  that  way.  Theif  they underestimate  the politics.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  real  question is  the  outlook for  theEMU.  If  one  thinks  the  EMU  is  going to  fail,  one would expect  thedeutsche mark  to  rally very  sharply.  If  one  expects  the  EMU to  holdtogether,  for whatever  reason--all  the  countries  may be  running  5percent  deficits  but  they may still  decide  to  come  together--thatmeans  the deutsche mark  is  going  to  be put  into  a structure that  willinhibit  its  strength,  which  is  what  the EMU will  do.  So,  what  isreally  involved is  a practical  judgment  about  the prospects  for  theEMU,  not  whether  it  is  good or  bad,  I don't  think  the market  is  goingto  be  judging whether  it  is  good or  bad.  They may in  fact view  it  asphoney as  a  four dollar  bill--an  American  four  dollar  bill.[Laughter]9/24/96

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The question, Governor Lindsey, is  whether weare  talking about  high politics  or  grass root  politics and that  isanother  source of  uncertainty.  The high politics may bring  it  about.The question  is whether  the grass  root politics will  follow the highpolitics.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I believe  also  that  there are acouple of  recent events  that make  one rather more  inclined to  thinkthat  the  politicians are  taking a fairly sensible  line.  The  last  timewe were  together,  there  was a real  question by most observers  as  towhether the  leading countries would allow the Maastrict  criteria  to befiddled.  You may say that  this  interesting  and creative budgetary  fixby the  French  is  a bit  of  a fiddle, but  I would note  that ChancellorKohl  on  the  occasion  of  President Tietmeyer's  65th birthday made avery strong  speech in  favor  of  Maastrict and  the need to  observe  itscriteria very carefully.  He  was  followed by  President Chirac whosupported him.  In addition,  there was  a very significant  event  lastweekend when  the Germans  took a position  that  I think is  veryrational.  The big risk  is not  that EMU may not take  place;  it  wouldappear now that it  will.  The  question is  what  happens  after it  does.The key to  that  is  what Finance Minister Waigel has brought  forth.  Itis  called a stability pact, and last weekend  in Dublin  the  financeministers  and central bankers met  and endorsed this  stability pact.That  is  a very  significant development.  They still  have  to  decidewhether the punishment  for violating the  fiscal  rules  after EMU willbe automatic and just how it will  work, but  the  agreement  in principleis  quite  significant.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is,  but  if  you  take an  asset  salethat  is  one-half percent  of  GDP  and consider  that appropriate, thefudging potential  involved  in  the  stability pact  is  quiteconsiderable.  So,  a lot  of  future  relationships  are at  stake.  Iagree  that  these  last  two  events  imply  that EMU  is  going to happen.The question  is  about  some of  the  crucial  issues  that  the  Germansspecifically are  very concerned  about,  especially a fudged ortemporary 3 percent Maastrict  followed by erosion.  The  Germans havemade very strong  statements  on  this  issue,  and the  question is  whetherthe agreements  are  in  fact going to  back up  those words.  I would saythat  the  evidence,  as  Governor Lindsey  suggests,  does  raise  somequestions.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Yes,  it  raises  questions.  However,before  these  recent developments,  the  overwhelming expectation wasthat  if  EMU happened, it  would be  followed by something that  simplywould not work.  The whole  notion  of  trying  to use  monetary unity  tocreate political  unity has  never  succeeded anywhere.  Now, it  looks asif  they are  doing  some  things  that  at  least make disaster not  aspredictable  as  it  seemed  to  be  until  recently.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  They  are cutting down  the  sharp  edges  ofthe  adjustment  costs.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Just based  on our  own  experience,  I  suspect  theywill  have  long  wrangles  in  the  context  of  the  stability pact  aboutwhat  counts  and what  does not.  It  isn't  until  you  have budgetsanctions  that you  even have  to  face  up  to  those  questions.  It  is9/24/96possible that  European markets  are  simply not very  sophisticated aboutbudgets  yet,  and that  what  counts and what  does not  is  something onwhich they have not  really focused.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Budget  accounting basically.

[SECTION]

RIVLIN.  Yes.  We have worried about  this  for  a while,  butthey have  not.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  That  is  a very good point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Even with our fairly  specific unifiedbudget principles,  there  is  an  awful  lot  of  fudging  that  goes  on inthe process.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  We  had  to  make rules  about  asset  sales.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  What  is  involved in  the  French budget  is  notactually an asset  sale, but  a somewhat  complicated  takeover of  pensionobligations  in return  for  cash.  It  is  a kind of  asset  sale.Economists  would call  it  an  asset  sale;  I'm not  sure accountantswould.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  call  it  an  asset sale.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  It  is  an  asset  sale  a la  francaise![Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions?  If  not, wouldsomeone  like  to move  for a vote  to  approve  the  domestic  operations?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I move  their approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Without  objection.  Mr.Prell.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  questions?  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mike,  the  information coming  from the  employmentdata may be  somewhat  clearer  than you  have  suggested  in  the  sensethat,  while admittedly the  unemployment  rate number  is  questionableand  the  labor  force  has  been very volatile with  large declines,  thenonfarm payroll message  is  very consistently strong  and seems  fairlyreliable.  In  addition,  I have  a feeling that  we  are  going  to haveupward revisions  in  that area.  We  have  had such revisions  in  the  lastcouple  of  years because  the  survey does  not  take  into  account,  as  wellas  it  should, hiring by new businesses.  There was  a big upwardadjustment when  the  last  revision was  made,  and  I would expect  to  seeanother.  So,  although  I agree  with your  point  about  the ambiguitysurrounding many of  the numbers  that have come  out  in  recent weeks,when  it  comes  to  the production side,  particularly employment,  itseems  to  me  that  we do  have very  consistent  strength.9/24/96

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't  think  I can comment very productively onyour point  about what  future  revisions may show.  We do  not have abasis  for a judgment about whether  the  allowances  that  the  BLS makesin blowing up  their  samples  for new firms  and  other statisticalproblems are  on  target this  time  or not.  To be  sure,  there  have beensizable revisions at  times  in the  past.  On the broader point,  as  Itried to  suggest, we certainly  do  see evidence  that  hiring hascontinued  to be  quite  robust, probably outstripping the  trend increasein  labor  force  growth.  However,  I am not  sure how much  that  tells  usabout things  going  forward.  It  may be  in  essence that  this  reflectsthe  strong production gains  that  we have  seen recently rather  than theanticipation of  much more  rapid growth  in business  than we haveprojected.  I think the  indicators  of  business  sentiment  that  we havesuggest that  firms  are  anticipating  growth, but not  necessarily growththat differs greatly  from what we  are  forecasting.  It  is  a risk, andcertainly  this  is  a part  of  the  picture where households  that haveenjoyed very sizable  income gains  recently, and probably arecontinuing to  do  so  in September,  add a certain buoyancy in  theeconomy that  is  visible  in  consumer sentiment.  That  is  probably aresponse to  the very  favorable  labor market environment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions?  If  not, wouldsomebody like  to  start  the roundtable?  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Economic  growth  in the  Eleventh District hascontinued  to  run a little  faster than  the national  average.  In recentmonths, we  have benefited  from higher energy prices,  the  rebound  inthe Mexican economy, and strong warehouse  construction activityfollowing  the deregulation of  trucking.  The Texas  rig count  has risen22 percent  so  far  this year, with  the  result  that  business andconsumer sentiment  is  quite high  in  Houston and Midland.  With therebound in the Mexican economy,  exports  from Texas  to  Mexico were  up17  percent  in  real  terms  in  the  first  half  of  1996  and are back  tolevels  that prevailed prior to  the peso  devaluation.  Rail  and trucktraffic also  has  returned  to predevaluation levels.  Optimism alongthe  border is  slowly returning.  Three months  ago,  only 10  percent  ofEl  Paso  employers planned to  hire  additional workers;  in  a recentsurvey, more than  26  percent planned  to  hire  new workers.Construction activity  in  the  District  is  expected  to  remain  strong, asfalling vacancy rates  and rising rents  improve the  anticipated returnson offices,  warehouses,  and  retail  space.  Office and  retail rentshave been  rising in  recent months.  In  some markets,  first  classoffice  space  is  about  fully absorbed.  Warehouse  constructioncontinues  to  be  strong particularly  in  Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, andEl  Paso.  This construction  activity has more  than offset  a very mildslowing  in  residential  construction.We  continue  to  hear  increased anecdotes  about  tight  laborthe  higher  labor  costs  will  have  to  be  passed  on  in  higher prices  atsome point  in  the  future.  But  so  far,  there  is  little anecdotalevidence  of  widespread price  increases.  At  both our board  ofdirectors meeting and  the meeting  of  our  advisory council  on smallbusiness  and agriculture,  there were  frequent mentions  of  shortages  ofa wide  variety of  workers  and  of  wage boosts  that  were considerable  insome  instances.  In  some but  not all  cases,  prices  have beenincreased, with  rising wages  as  the  justification.9/24/96 -5-Regarding  the national  economy, I agree with the  broadoutline of  the  near-term outlook  in  the Greenbook.  Some  signs ofslowing have  begun to  show up  and growth more  in line  with  theeconomy's  long-run potential  seems  more  likely than was  the  case atthe  time  of  our  August meeting.  The  risks,  however, appear  to  be  onthe  up  side  for both growth and  inflationary pressures.  If  anything,the risks  have  risen over  the past  several weeks, but  I continue  tofeel  that we may be worrying too  much about  sizable employment  growthand  low unemployment  rates  when prices  themselves  and leadingindicators of  final  prices,  such as  prices  of  commodities and metals,including gold, are behaving so well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I first want  to  comment  on BobParry's point  about  the  nonfarm payroll numbers  because  thoserevisions go  in  both directions  as we have  seen.  Currently, the  BLSis  using a plug of  140,000 per month  for jobs  created  in new businessstartups.  In  1990,  they were using 80,000  per month.  Theysubsequently decided that  the number  should be negative and wound uprevising the  employment data down.  By the nature of  those plugs,  theyare  always going  to miss  the  turning points.  At  some  point, there  isgoing to  be  a big revision  in  the opposite  direction, just  like  lastyear's  upward revision.Turning  to  the  national  economy, we  got  a copy of  the Augustsurvey of  the National  Federation of  Independent  Business, which wasalso mentioned in  some of  the material  we  received from the  Boardstaff  last  night.  I noted with  interest that  an  expansion high 27percent  of  the  firms  said  that  they have  been  increasing theircompensation, and yet  there  was  a decline  in  the percentage  that  saidthey were going to  be  raising their  prices and  an  increase  in  thenumber saying that  their  earnings were  improving.  That  says  to methat productivity is  really quite  good.  Plans  for  capital  spendingrose  4 percentage points,  so  at  least  from  that  sample  of  a very largenumber  of  small businesses,  the productivity explanation  ofdevelopments  in  compensation is being verified.On  the  strike  situation, people  in  the  District  are verypleased with  the outcome  of  the  Ford  contract  and they generally donot  expect GM to  take  a strike.  But  the  answers were  not entirelyconsistent  on  that point.  We have  talked to  the  large  auto  suppliercompanies  who  say  the UAW's  concern  is  not GM workers;  it  is  UAWworkers.  GM wants to  sell  some of  their parts  operations.  The UAWwants a say in  who buys  those parts  operations  because  the union wantsthem to  remain UAW plants  under the  new owners.  If  that  is  agreed  to,the UAW may go  along with GM's outsourcing  intentions.  The  issue  isnot going  to  come down  to  compensation, and  the  big companies  that  wehave talked to  say  that  they do not  expect  a strike.In  the  District, we  have  had a number  of  meetings  in  the  lastfew weeks with directors,  advisory councils,  and bankers.  We  askedthem  about  the kinds  of  capital  spending  they  had seen and businessplans  for  the  future.  We  asked in  particular whether  business  firmswere  trying mainly  to  increase  capacity or  trying  to  increaseproductivity.  Most  said  that  capital  spending would continue  toexpand but  at  a slower pace  through  1997  compared with what we  haveseen  in  the past  three  or  four years,  and  it  would be  almost  entirely9/24/96-6-for  the purpose  of  improving productivity.  I have  only a few  storiesabout  firms  that  are actually increasing  their  capacity.  One  directorreported that the paper processing equipment  now being installed  uses50  percent  less  labor  than the  equipment  it  is  replacing.  Since  thecapacity of paper producing  operations  is  growing,  there  has been somesoftness in prices,  but he  said  the  really extraordinary efficiency ofthis  new equipment  is what  is  driving the  industry's  investmentWe asked firms  about  compensation  increases  and whether  intheir  judgment,  or  that of  other firms  they  talked to,  the  increaseswere warranted on  the basis  of  productivity  improvements  or whetherthey were  seeing pressure on  earnings  and/or pressure for higherprices.  We did not  hear any stories about higher prices.  We did hearsome  stories  about  pressure on  earnings,  but basically our  contactswere  saying  that they were not  going  to  be passing along higher  laborcosts  or  attempting to raise prices  for  the  foreseeable  future.  Wedid hear  some reports  that  it  is now easier  to  find people  at  theentry level  than it  was  earlier,  especially in Kentucky and Indianawhere  it  had been very difficult.  One of  the  directors  from westernPennsylvania  simply said  that business  there was  in  the  doldrums.Steel  and oil  executives  tell  us  that  their production capacity isrising  faster than  demand, and they  expect downward pressure onprices.  Basically,  they  said the  investment  in  steel producingfacilities  in  the  last couple of  years  is  starting to  come  on streamnow and will  continue  doing so  out into  1997.  Accordingly, withforeign competition also  increasing, they  expect more difficulty  injust  holding  the  level  of  steel prices.We have  continued  to  hear stories about  rising delinquencies,late payments,  bankruptcy filings,  and therefore more charge-offs  inthe banking  industry.  One report  that  I found interesting  for  an  areathat  is  so  heavily influenced by motor vehicles  is  that  there  is  anample  supply of  tool  and die makers.  This  is  not usual  for  our partof  the  country in  the  sixth year of  an  expansion.  The reason given isthat  investment  in  computerized design and manufacturing  technology ismaking these  people easy  to  find.  One very large  auto parts  companysaid  that  they  are  now producing  the  same  truck parts with  20  percentfewer hours  than  in  1994.  Productivity improvements  at  their plantshave been  averaging  5 to  7 percent per year, and  they expect  that  tocontinue.Let  me turn  to  the  Greenbook  and the  national  economy.  Itseems  to me  that  there  are at  least  four views about monetary policyin  the  current  situation  that  are  all  respectable views  even  if  notequally probable.  Of  course,  there could  be  some  combination of  thesefour views.  One  is  that  the  current  stance of  monetary policy is  suchthat  in  the  future we  are  going to  see  an  acceleration  in  the  growthof  final  demand.  But because  of  capacity constraints,  however onewants  to  think about  that,  the  growth in  output or  aggregate  supplycannot  increase  along with  aggregate demand,  and  therefore we will  gethigher prices.  That  is  why at  the  last  meeting  I was  so  disturbed bythe  upward revision  in  the  nominal  GDP projections  through  1997.  Thatrevision  has  now been  reversed in  part,  so  my concern  from  that  sourcehas  been relieved.  A second view  is  that  the  stance of  monetarypolicy is  not  going  to produce  an acceleration  of  growth  in  aggregatedemand, but  growth in  aggregate supply will  slow  toward an  annual  rateof  about  2 percent because  of  capacity  constraints.  That  assumes9/24/96productivity and  labor market conditions  similar to  those  in  thecurrent Greenbook.  Therefore, inflationary pressures  are going  toincrease modestly in  this view, but  they will  still  increase.  A  thirdposition is  that  the  current  stance of monetary policy  is going tolead to  a slowing in  the growth of  nominal  spending and  in aggregatesupply or potential  output  at  a more or  less parallel rate.Therefore,  inflation will continue  at about  the  same  rate;  we  simplydo not make any progress  in reducing inflation.  The  fourth positionwould be  that  nominal  spending growth  is  going to  slow because of  thecurrent  stance  of  monetary policy, but  output growth is  not going  toslow as much because  of  the productivity improvements  from the  capitalspending  of  the  last  four years--the  introduction of  new technologies,and all  of  that.  Therefore, we will  get  less price pressure  in  thefuture.  I think that  those  scenarios pretty much encompass  the  viewsof what we are hearing  from Wall  Street,  from analysts, and othercommentary about whether current policy  is  too  tight  or  too easy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Economic  activity in  our District  hascontinued to  expand at  a reasonably steady pace  over  the period  sinceour  last meeting.  There does  appear to  have  been some moderation inthe rate  of growth of  household spending  and also  in  residentialconstruction activity in  some parts  of  our region  from their verystrong pace  in the  first half  of  the year.  But our latest  regularsurvey of  manufacturing  indicates  that factory activity rebounded verysharply in  the  latter part  of  the  summer from its  somewhat  sluggishperformance  earlier in  the  summer.  Shipments,  new orders, employment,and  the  average workweek have  all  been rising in  that  sector.  Also,as  noted  in  our Beigebook report  and picking up on  a comment  that MikePrell  made,  commercial real  estate  activity clearly has  strengthenedthrough most  of  our  region as  vacancy rates have declined and rentalrates  have  crept  up.  The  improvement  is not  so apparent  in  theWashington metropolitan area,  but  it  is  very evident  in  the southernpart  of  the  District  in particular.Probably  the most  striking aspect of  the  recent  regionalinformation--and I suspect this  is  true around  the  country--is  thepersistent and increasingly widespread reports of  very tight  laborbusiness  and agricultural  advisory  committee and  all  five smallbusiness  representatives  who  attended reported some difficulty  inattracting workers  despite  fairly  sizable wage  increases  in  somecases.  We  continue  to  get  similar  comments  from the  directors  on allof  our boards  and in response  to  our periodic surveys.  Recently andinterestingly,  there have been more  complaints especially  fromconstruction firms  and  employment agencies  about  the  difficulty offinding suitable  unskilled  and semi-skilled workers.  There  are  peopleout  there,  but  many of  them have very  little  job  experience and  insome cases  very little  schooling.  As  a result,  their productivity  isquite  low and firms  are reluctant  to hire  them  in  light  of  thepotential  costs  of  doing  so.  Given this  situation,  some of  ourcontacts have  told us  that  local  labor markets  are  really tighter inmany cases  than the  already  low  state and  local  unemployment ratesmight  suggest.  One other  indication of  tight  labor markets comes  fromstate  reports  of  withheld taxes;  I think  the  latter are  running higherin all  of  our  states  and jurisdictions  than  had been projected  earlierin  the  year.9/24/96Finally, Hurricane  Fran  hit  our region pretty hard.  Iremember  looking at  the  radar weather report,  and at  one  point  theclouds were  coterminous with  the  boundaries of my District.  NorthCarolina was  especially hard hit;  the  damage there  is  estimatedsomewhere  in  the neighborhood of  $3-1/2  billion and the majority ofit,  though not  all  by any means, was  to private  residences.  Repairingthat  damage  is  going to  spur  activity in  a local  area  that  is  alreadyoperating at  a very high  level  of  economic  activity in relation tocapacity.I do not have a lot  to  say about  the  national picture beyondwhat  I have  been saying for  the  last  couple of meetings and thatalready has  been noted by Jerry and others.  The Greenbook projectioncontinues to  reflect the  view that monetary policy  is  now restrictiveenough to  foster a deceleration in  real  GDP growth to  its  long-termpotential, and  then to maintain such  growth pretty much  indefinitely.In  this  environment,  core  inflation moves up  fairly modestly to about3 percent  in  1997  and holds  there  in 1998.  Maybe  this will  happen,but my  feeling  is  that it  is  hardly a sure  thing, and I continue tothink that  there  are significant upside  risks on both  the  real  sideand the  inflation  side  in the  current projection period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mr. Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In  my view, the  recenteconomic data  and anecdotal  information show an  economy that  isoperating at  a healthy pace.  In fact,  coming  off  a surprisinglystrong  second quarter,  GDP growth  is  averaging just under  3 percent  ona year-over-year basis  and  is  exceeding my  earlier expectations.  Asothers  have  observed,  the  growth  is  both broadly based and withoutserious  imbalances.  Job growth, which has gotten  so much attentionand discussion, underscores  the  strength of  economic  activity.Although labor  shortages  are not widespread  in our  District,  I amhearing more complaints  in  recent weeks  and months about both  thequantity and the  quality of  available workers.  Fortunately,investment spending  seems  to  have kept  capacity utilization within areasonable  range.  The  slowdown that  I had expected in  the pace ofactivity has  been slower in  coming and  is  still  less  obvious  than  Ihad anticipated.  Some  signs  of  slowdown, which we  thought we  saw  inthe data  in  earlier months,  were either  revised away or reversed.  Forexample,  after  sorting through  the mixed signals  that Mike  Prellreviewed  on housing,  it  looks  as  though  that  sector has  continued  tobe  surprisingly strong and  that  has  brought with  it  strong spending  onconsumer  durables.  The most  recent  data on  retail  sales may  signalsome  slowing  in  consumer spending, but  it  seems  to me  that  theunderlying  fundamentals  of  job  and income  growth provide a continuingsource of  strength.  Our revised  forecast  for  the remainder  of  1996and into  1997  is  for  a continuation of  good growth but with  somemoderation.  That  moderation, again,  is not  coming as  soon  nor  to  thesame  degree as  we  had earlier  forecast.Despite  the  greater  than  expected pace  of  growth  and the  lowrate  of  unemployment, price pressures  appear to  remain modest.  Whilethe  special  effects of  the  increases  in  energy and  food prices areworking  their  way through  the price  indices,  economy-wide measures  ofprices  remain  low.  At  the  same  time,  I am hearing more and moreconcerns  anecdotally about wage  pressures.  Some  business people  Ihave  talked  to  are  actively weighing  the  costs  and benefits  of  trying9/24/96to  hire more  qualified workers,  and with  that  they seem  to  bedeveloping a clear  intention  to  try to  pass  through their  higher costsby increasing  their  output prices.  At  the  same  time, we continue  tohear stories  of  intense competition that  limits price  increases acrossalmost  all  industries,  sometimes  causing price  increases  earlier  inthe year  to be  rolled back.  Finally, in my conversations  I continueto  try to  gauge  expectations  for both  growth and  inflation.  While itis  hard to  find  folks who want  to  argue that  growth is  too  strong,  theone plea I almost always  get when  I have  serious  and in-depthdiscussions  is  for  a policy  that  optimizes  the chance  of  keepinginflation at  moderate  levels.  That  is  something  that people  wouldlike  to  be  able to  take  for granted  in  their  decision-making andnegotiations.In  the Southeast,  we have  continued to  see  growth at  amoderate pace  in August  and September.  Retail  sales remain  strongand, in  fact,  exceed last  year's  levels.  Tourism, which is  soimportant  to  our District  and especially to  Florida, has been  somewhatmixed, but  the  outlook is  mostly positive.  Consumer confidenceremains unchanged, while manufacturing  continues  to  expand at amoderate pace.  The declines  in  the apparel  and textile sectors  that  Ipreviously talked about  at  these  meetings  continue  to  show up.  Partof  that  loss  is  being made up by the  expansion of  the  auto  industry  inour region.  Single-family home sales were mixed  throughout  theDistrict,  while builders noted that  new home  sales  and  constructionremain healthy but  flat.  As Al  Broaddus  observed  for his region,class A office  space  is  in short  supply  in several  of  our markets,  andwe  are beginning  to  see  some speculative projects,  notably in  Floridaand Atlanta.  District bankers  report  moderately strong  loan demandand some  decline in  credit  quality.  Payroll  employment  increased inmore common.  Despite  those, there  are  few  signs  of  increasing wagesand only spotty reports  that  the  increases are affecting marketprices.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, overall  economic  conditions  inNew England remain good.  In particular,  the  regional  unemploymentrate  in August  was a full  percentage point  below the national  rate.Initial  unemployment  claims have  been  falling and are  approachinglevels  last  seen  in the  1980s.  In thinking  about  this,  we had adiscussion about  how our  regional  economy feels  now versus  how it  feltin  the  late  1980s.  Basically, the  thinking is  that  the dynamism--oras  some would phrase  it,  the  frenzy--that  characterized  the NewEngland economy in  the  late  1980s  is  not there  now even  though theunemployment  numbers are  approaching the  levels of  the  late  1980s.Payroll  employment expanded only  1 percent  over  the past year  or  atabout half  the national  rate.  Help-wanted advertising  is  about  thesame as  a year  ago and well  below the  levels  of  10 years  ago.  Thegrowth  in  average hourly  earnings remains  subdued, with  increases  forproduction workers only  about  1.9  percent  in  New England over  the pastyear compared with a national  increase of  more  than  3 percent.However, the  anecdotal reports  are more positive  than  the  statistics,and  there  is  some  speculation  that  the  state  employment numbers willbe  revised up when  the  benchmark revisions  are  done  in  early 1997.State  tax  receipts  suggest greater  strength  than  the  employment datashow.9/24/96-10-The  largest disconnect between statistics  and  anecdotes  is  inthe manufacturing  sector.  Employment continues  to  drift  down at NewEngland manufacturers,  but  our informal  contacts  are  generally verypositive.  Most  report  sales  and orders  comfortably  above year-agolevels.  Some report  smaller increases  than  earlier  in the year, butothers  see no  evidence  of  any  slowing.  A great  exception  to  this  isthe paper industry, which Jerry Jordan mentioned before.Manufacturing inventories  are  in good shape.  Prices generally areflat  and wage  increases  are  in the  2-1/2  to  4 percent  range.  Mostfirms  say they are  not  feeling wage pressures, but  it  depends  on  thekinds  of  employees  they are  looking  for.  Computer and softwareengineers are much  in  demand and can be  had only  if  the  employmentpackage  is  sweetened with  stock options and other incentives.  Reportsfrom  the retail  sector were also  positive.  Absent  from  the  latestreports were  the customary  complaints  about  excess capacity and newcompetitors.  Upscale products  are doing especially well.  Here,  too,prices generally are  flat, with  a few  increases  of  1 to  2 percentreported.  There are  some recent articles  that  have  suggested thatchanges  in  temporary help employment may be a leading indicator.  Ifso,  the  reports  from  our contacts  in this  industry point  to continuedstrength.  Business  continues  to grow rapidly, wages  are  rising, andone  contact reports  that qualified workers  in  the technical  andprofessional  areas  are able  to  demand wage  increases  of  5 to  10percent over year-ago  levels  because  they  are  in demand  and becausethere  is  a wide range  of  options  in  terms  of projects  for  them.Turning  to  the  national  scene, we mostly agree with  theGreenbook path for  GDP, though I would question whether consumerspending will  fall  off  quite  as  sharply as  expected in  the  thirdquarter.  However,  that GDP path, given  stable  low unemployment  ratesthrough  1998,  does  not  seem likely to  result  in  such  a stable level  ofinflation as  is  expected in the  Greenbook.  By  anyone's  estimate,labor  markets are  tight.  The unemployment  rate right now may not  be5.1  percent,  but  I do  not think  it  is  5.4  percent,  and I have  somedoubts  about whether  it  will bounce back  to  5.4  percent  quickly.  Sucha bounceback seems  to  be what  is  needed  to  create  the  rather  low CPIprojections  that  are  included  in  the Greenbook  estimate.  Theinflation picture  is  also more  than normally confused by BLSmeasurement  changes.  We  have  ignored those  changes  for  the purpose  ofattempting  to  compare  like  numbers,  which I know is  futile, but  theydo  appear to  show an uptick of  a slightly greater dimension than  isreflected  in  the Greenbook numbers.  The Greenbook  forecast  in  somesense  is  an  idyllic  one, but  the  sense  that  I have  is  that we  areusing more  than  the normal  amount  of  smoke and mirrors  to  create  thisidyll,  and you should  forgive  that  phrase, Mike.  As  I see  it,  thisforecast  is  a very risky  one.  Growth may well  be  stronger, and  evenif  it  is  not,  the  flow-through  to  inflation may well  be morepronounced than  is  projected in  the Greenbook.Let  me  close  by noting  that our  Bank,  along with everybodyelse's,  has normal  rounds of  meetings with  outside groups.  We  had agroup  of  academicians  in  the  other day--Paul  Samuelson, JimDuesenberry, Marty Feldstein, Rudi Dornbusch, Bill  Poole,  and BenFriedman--people who  rarely agree about  anything.  But  they were allin  harmony on  the  subject  of  where monetary policy  is  right  now.  Theyall  felt  that  it  was  a little  too  "not restrictive,"  let's  put  it  thatway,  or  a little  too  easy  for  the  conditions  as  they  saw  them and  inneed of  a bit  of  tightening.  Of  course,  there was  a lot  of  debate.9/24/96-11-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  economic conditions  in  the SeventhDistrict  are  quite  similar to what  I reported last  time.  Our regionaleconomy is  still  operating at  a very high level.  The pace  of  theexpansion  has  slowed  somewhat  from  the  first  half  of  the year,  but  byless  than had been expected.  The  housing sector has  held upremarkably well  in many areas  of  the  District.  Housing  starts,permits, and home  sales  in the  Midwest were  all  up  sharply  in July.Housing starts  did come  down a bit  in August, but  that  retraced only asmall part  of  the  16  percent  July surge.  Manufacturing activity inthe  District generally remains  strong.  Orders  in  the  second quarterand  the  early part  of  the  third quarter exceeded  expectations  in mostcore  industries including  light motor vehicles,  constructionmachinery, metal  working  equipment, appliances,  and steel.  The  secondhalf of  1996  is  still  expected to be  softer  than  the  first  half  formost of  these  industries,  but  some  of  that expected softness  seems  tohave been pushed out a quarter.We have  just  received the Chicago  Purchasing Managers  surveyfor  September, which  I would caution  is  confidential  until  it  isreleased to  the public next Monday, September  30.  The  index will  showoverall activity expanding at  a solid pace of  56.3.  That  is  slightlyslower  than  the robust pace  suggested by the August  survey, but thecomponent, which has  been  indicating modest  increases,  surged inDistrict  retailer  reports  on  sales activity for  the  firsthalf  of  September  ranged from  flat  to  modest year-over-year gains.Sales  over  the  Labor Day weekend were  lower  than expected, but  onemajor national  retailer  in our District  noted a sharp pickup  in theweek after  Labor Day.  Auto  and light  truck  sales have  been strongerthan expected according  to  our contacts  in  the  industry.  Sales  in  thefirst half  of  September seemed  to be  tracking  at  a 15  to  15.1  millionannual  rate.  This pace  is  consistent  with the  Greenbook's upwardrevised  forecast  for  sales  to  average  15  million  units  in  the  thirdquarter.  On  the  auto negotiations,  I do  not  have much  to  add;  JerryJordan already  commented on  this.  I would mention  that  there are,  ofcourse,  two sets  of  negotiations going on--those  in  the  United Statesand  those  in  Canada.  Our assessment  is  that  there  is  a much  higherprobability of  a strike by the  Canadian GM workers  than by the U.S.workers.  But  because of  the  close  relationship between  the  U.S.  andCanadian plants,  a strike  in Canada,  if  it  occurs,  would eventuallyhave a very  serious  impact  on  the  U.S.  economy.On  employment  conditions  generally, the news  is  still  thesame.  Labor markets remain  tight  in  the  Seventh District.  Payrollemployment  growth, however,  has  been slower  than  for  the  nation,perhaps  reflecting  some  labor  supply constraints  in  our District.Similar  to what  Al  Broaddus  reported, when our  small  business  andagricultural  advisory council  met  earlier  this  month, they voicedconcern also  about  the  difficulty of  finding and  keeping qualifiedworkers,  and  this  concern  is  shared by many in  our  District.  Itseemed to  be  most acute  for  entry-level  jobs,  particularly  inretailing, but  construction  and  factory workers  are  also  reported to9/24/96-12-be harder  to  find.  Firms  throughout  the  District have been  increasingstarting salaries  and entry-level wages,  often including  signingbonuses,  and doing more on-the-job  training to  deal with  these laborshortages.  One manufacturer reported raising  its  starting wage  of$7.50  an hour  to  $10.00  to  attract qualified workers.reported that  his  firm  is  now in the  process  of deciding how torespond to  a 33  percent  increase  in  truck driver compensation  that wasannounced by the  second largest  trucking firm  in  the  industry.  Thatincrease  is  scheduled  to  go  into effect  in  February.trucking  firm in  the  United StatesMore generally on  the price  front,  most  firms  indicate  thatit  is  still  extremely  difficult  to get price  increases  through despitehaving to pay higher wages.  However, we  continue to  get  somescattered  reports  of  rapidly rising prices.  Building materials priceswere  reported to be  increasing:  Cement  is  being rationed and gypsumboard is  on  allocation  in some  areas.  Steel prices have  increased butare  still  below a year ago.  The  October price hike  may not hold,however, if  added capacity comes  on  stream as expected.  Truckingfirms  are  imposing a fuel  surcharge  that  translates  into  about  a 2percent  increase  in prices paid by their  customers.Turning to  the national  outlook, my assessment has  notchanged greatly  since  our last  meeting.  I still  expect growth inaggregate  demand to  slow to  a more modest  pace  late  this year or  earlyin  1997.  However,  I continue  to believe  that  there  is  a danger  thatthe moderation will have  come  too  late.  Resource  utilization ratesare  already high enough to  suggest gradual  acceleration in coreinflation, as  reflected  in  the Greenbook after the  adjustments  for  theBLS measurement  changes.  Moreover, growth  seems  likely  to  remainrelatively strong for  another quarter or  two, which  is  likely  toexacerbate  this  situation.  The recent news  on  inflation,  of  course,has  been  favorable, but  I am  concerned that  this  will  not  continue.The  further tightening of  labor markets  revealed by  the most  recentemployment report  combined with  the  anecdotal reports  of  laborscarcity  that we  have  all  heard suggest  that we  can  expect  to  see wageincreases  in  excess  of  productivity gains.  Profit  margins  may shrinksomewhat  but ultimately,  as  Mike Prell  said before, more rapid priceincreases  are  likely to  be  the  result.  The risks  in  the currentsituation  are heavily on  the  side  of  increased inflation.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very much.  President  Parry.

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  strong economic growth  iscontinuing  in  the  Twelfth District,  although with  some  slowing  in Julyfrom  the very brisk second-quarter pace.  The California  economy hasperformed very well  in  recent months,  with annualized payrollemployment  growth averaging  3.4  percent  during May  through August.Although Los  Angeles  county continues  to  be  somewhat weak, other partsof  southern California  are  gaining  jobs  and residents,  with many  ofthese  coming  from Los  Angeles  county.  The  Washington State  economyhas  accelerated  further in  recent months,  spurred by rapidmanufacturing job growth associated primarily with  the resurgence  atBoeing.  Payroll  employment  growth in  most  of  the  other Districtstates  is  very strong, ranging  from about  4 to  7 percent  at  an annualrate.  Slight  recent  slowing  is  reflected in  decelerated manufacturingemployment growth  in  the  District  boom  states  of  Nevada, Utah, Oregon,Arizona,  and  Idaho.  The  only exceptions  to  strong  growth  are Alaska9/24/96-13-and Hawaii.  Alaska's  growth has  been slow in  1996,  and Hawaii hasactually lost  jobs  in  recent months.  There  are  signs  of  increasinggrowth in  average wages  in  several  parts of  the District.  Theincreases  have  been large and accelerating in Nevada and Utah, whichone would expect,  and they have  occurred in  the construction and tradesectors  in  addition  to manufacturing.  Wage  increases  in other  statesmostly have  been moderate.  There are  signs  of  a slight pickup  inCalifornia, although  from relatively  low rates.Turning  to  the national  economy, production-side  data,particularly employment as  we discussed, have been  quite stronglately.  On  their own,  they portray a robust economy.  However, on  thespending  side,  consumption and  retail  sales  have not  been doing aswell.  When this  information  is  incorporated into  the  recently revisednonstructural model  that  we  now use  in San Francisco  to  forecastcurrent quarter output growth,  it  produces a growth rate  of  2 percentin  the  third quarter.  Combining  this  forecast with  that  from  ourstructural model,  we  expect output  growth  in the  2 to  2-1/2  percentrange  in  the  second half  of  this year  as well as  in  the  first half  ofnext year.  This  forecast  assumes  that  the recent  slowdown  inconsumption spending  is  temporary.  If  consumption  spending  fails  topick up,  obviously output growth will  be  slower.To  my mind, however,  the growth  forecast is  simply icing  on acake  that already has  greater wage and price inflation baked in.  Evenif  growth comes  in, say,  1/2  percentage point  less  in  the  second halfof  this  year, we will  still  be  left  with a quite  low unemployment  rateof probably less  than  5-1/2 percent.  Based on  this,  we  anticipate anacceleration of  inflation on  the  order of  1/4  to  1/2  percentage pointin a wide variety of  price and compensation measures during  1997.I realize that  there  is  some uncertainty associated with  thisforecast.  For instance,  the  coefficients  of  the underlying  Phillipscurve are  associated with  sizable  standard errors.  However,  as  far  asI know,  the  Phillips  curve  is  still  the best  model  available  toforecast  inflation and our  analysis  suggests  that  the  Phillips  curveis  basically  on  track.  With unemployment  clearly below the naturalrate, wages  are  accelerating  and price pressures  are building.

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  Tenth Districteconomy remains  strong, and  I do  not have a lot  to  add to  my previousreports.  I would point out  that our directors  continue  to  reporthealthy business  conditions  throughout our  District.  Retail  sales  andhome  building appear  to  be  holding up well  in nearly all parts  of  theDistrict.  Manufacturing  continues  to  operate  at  high  levels  ofcapacity;  employment  levels  remain high;  rail  shipments  by one  of  ourmajor companies  are up  about  5 percent  this  quarter over  an alreadystrong  second quarter.  Crop producers  are  expecting a sharp  boost  inincome  as  very  large  crop yields  should be  combined  this year withgood prices.  So  they are very optimistic.  The  cattle  industry isshowing  some  improvement  as  well,  although ranchers  are  still  losingsome money and  feeders  are making  just  a little.  Wage  and pricepressures  appear  to have  increased in  the  District according  to  theanecdotal  reports.  In  addition,  price  increases  for  replacementequipment  and machinery parts  are being reported  to  us  somewhat moreoften as  we  go  around  the  District.  Having  said that,  when we  shake9/24/96-14-everything out  in terms  of  the  anecdotal  evidence,  our retailers  arestill  feeling the pressure  from rising  costs,  but we are  not  seeing alot of  it  being passed on  into  higher prices at  this  stage.On  the national  economy,  I have no  quarrel with  the Greenbookforecast.  We  see  the  outlook much  as  it  is  being shown  there, withall major sectors  in relatively good shape.  As  pointed out in  theGreenbook, methodology changes  are serving  to  lower  the  CPI  numbers,but when these  numbers  are  adjusted and prepared on a consistent  basisI agree with  the projection that  core  CPI  inflation will  be trendingup  over  the next two  years.  I think we have  to  be aware of  that.  Ialso  have noticed, not  only  in  our District but  a little more widelyon  the basis  of  anecdotal reports,  that  there  is  a bit  more of  aspeculative bent  to  the  economy  in  terms  of  types  of  investments inland and in  some of  the  asset  areas.  I believe we should at  leasttake note  of  that  at  this  stage.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  The  Philadelphia District economy is  growing,but not booming, and attitudes  are generally positive.  Some  laborsome upward pressure on wages but  downward pressure on benefit  costs,especially health care  costs.  There  are some  examples  of  upward pricepressures related to  steel  and plastic  inputs.  One  also hears,  ofcourse,  that  prices are being  raised indirectly.  For example,  fitnessequipment  suppliers are  raising the  minimum order  required for  freedelivery.  Some  auto dealers are giving  smaller discounts.  Overall,however, price pressures  are  still  subdued in  the District,  withbusinesses reporting  strong  competitive pressures  that  continue tomake  it difficult  to pass  along price  increases;  they also  reportbetter productivity gains  than  in  the published data.Turning to  the nation,  there  is  something  for  everyone,depending on what  story one wants  to  tell,  but  not  all  is  murky.Clearly, there  is  a risk  of  accelerating inflation because  of  anoverheating economy.  The risk, however, is  more one  of  an  upwardcreep in  the  rate of  inflation  than  a breakout  of  inflation.  Actualinflation rates are  still  remarkably  subdued,  and most  of  the pipelineindicators  are quiescent  as  well.  The  case  for  a moderating pace  ofeconomic  growth, while not  completely convincing,  is  nonethelesssubstantial.  We do  a fairly good job of  forecasting  the  direction ofgrowth.  We do  less  well  forecasting  the  timing and magnitude ofchange.  But  the  expansion of  consumption  appears  to  be  slowing  andthe rate  of  GDP  growth  likely will  be  substantially less  during  thesecond half  of  1996  than in  the  first half.  There  is  a tensionbetween data  on  the  supply side  of  the  economy and  the demand  side,which usually  says  something  is  going  on  in  inventories.  LaborAlthough industrial  production rose  1/2  percent  in August,  capacityutilization  in manufacturing actually declined slightly, suggestingless  risk of  bottlenecks  in production.  Also,  the  rate  ofunemployment  consistent with stable  and low inflation  rates  has variedover  the  last  several  decades;  it  is  not  constant.  Finally, monetarypolicy is broadly neutral.  We  almost  surely will  not have  far  to  gowhenever an  adjustment  is  decided upon.  In  short,  we  still  have  timefor watchful  waiting,  if  we  want  to  take  advantage  of  it,  withoutletting down  our guard against escalating  inflation.9/24/96-15-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  Labor markets  are  tight  in theEighth District  according  to most  contacts.  The  average unemploymentrate  for Arkansas,  Kentucky, Missouri,  and Tennessee was  4.8  percentin July compared with the  national  rate  of  5.4  percent  for  that monthand  5.1 percent  in August.  A major hotel  chain  that  is  planning tohire  about 2,000  workers  in  the  St.  Louis area  in the  coming year hasheld numerous  job  fairs  and  has established  a toll  free  phone numberto  search for  and aid applicants.  District payroll  employment  growth,however,  has  slowed in recent months, but  given other developmentsthis may reflect a shortage  of workers  available  to  fill positionsrather than  a decline  in  labor demand.  Michael Moskow mentionedsomething along these  lines  as  well.  McDonnell  Douglas ended  thestrike with their machinists  union during the  intermeeting period.  Inthe  agreement, union workers will  receive a 4 percent  lump sum bonusthis year  on  top  of  their normal  cost  of  living  increase plus  a 2-1/2percent wage  increase  next May.  In  addition, retirement benefits wereincreased more  than 24  percent,  from  $33  to  $41  dollars  for  each yearof  credited service.  All  told,  this  settlement  represents  asubstantial increase  in worker compensation.  District  retailers thatwe  surveyed reported summer sales  increases  of  up  to  about  5 percentover  the  same period  last year.  Auto  sales,  in contrast, were flat,but  District automotive production is  expected to  enjoy a normalseasonal upswing  in  the  third and  fourth quarters  and  is projected  tobe  up more  than 22  percent  for  the  year as  a whole.  Sales  of new andexisting homes are up  in most  parts  of  the District.The national  economy  is  coming off  one of  its best  quartersin  recent memory.  The growth rate  of  GDP was  so  fast  that it  is  easyto predict  slower growth  in  the  second half  of  the year.  With nearly1/2  million nonfarm payroll  jobs  created  in  the  first  two months  ofthe  current quarter,  employment growth  is  more  than double the  trendpace of  labor  force  growth,  and that means  further tightening ofalready  tight  labor markets.  Many private-sector  forecasts  of  aslowdown  in  real  output growth  in  the  second half  of  this  year havebeen  incorporating expectations  of  Fed action--action  that has  not yetmaterialized.  Even  if  the  economy does  slow  to  a trend pace of  growthover  the  remainder of  the year,  1996  is  going to  be  a big  improvementover  1995  and in my view  the downside  risks  for  the  real  economy arequite  low.  The risks  of  more  inflation, on  the  other hand, are all  onthe  up  side.  The Board staff predicts  faster  increases  in workercompensation.  It  is  forecasting a rise  in  the  employment  cost  indexfrom 2.6 percent  last  year  to  3.3  percent  this  year and  3.6  percent  in1997.  In  1994  and 1995,  CPI  inflation was  2.6  and 2.7  percent,respectively.  On a basis  consistent with those  figures,  the  Boardstaff  now forecasts  3.4  percent  CPI  inflation  for both the  currentyear  and 1997.  Such  developments  are  against  the backdrop of  moneygrowth near  the  top end  of  the Committee's ranges,  readily availablecredit,  and a booming equity market.In  the  absence of  any  reaction by this  Committee  in  thesecircumstances, market  participants may easily conclude  that  the"acceptable" rate of  inflation has  moved up.  This would reinforceinflationary expectations  and make  our  job  tougher in  the  long  run.We  simply cannot  afford not  to  react  to  the  scenario  laid  out  in  ourinflation  forecast.9/24/96-16-

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  By almost  all  objectivemeasures,  the  economy  in  the Ninth District  remains very healthy.Labor markets  continue  to  be  tight  and,  given  the quality of  newhires, businesses  report  spending increasing amounts  on training newworkers.  Our District  is  one  of  those where  the  local measures ofhousing activity would be  consistent with  the  surprisingly positivenational  statistics.  Housing  through most of  the District has beenbetter  this  year, whether  we are  talking about  sales  or  newconstruction,  than  it  was  in both of  the  preceding  two years  and hascontinued to  hold up as  the  year has progressed.  This  also  turnedout,  somewhat  surprisingly,  to  be  a satisfactory summer  tourism seasoneven though  it  got  off  to  a slow start.  Despite  these positiveobjective measures,  business  attitudes  appear  to  be  a bit  on  thecautious  side at  the moment based on our  recent conversations.  I amnot  exactly sure about  the  source  of  this  disconnect.  It  may be  thatbusinessmen are  in fact  expecting  the  slowing  that has been widelyadvertised for  the  second half,  or  it  may be that  they are  influencedby their continuing  inability to  raise prices  and the  continuingvirulence  of  competitive pressures.With regard to  the national  economy, I certainly agree withthe  spirit  of  the  Greenbook forecast,  so  I will make  only a fewcomments.  I think the  economy is  on  solid footing.  It  appears  thatdemand  is  moderating, but  it  is  uncertain  if  this  moderation  issufficient to  relieve pressures  on  resources  in  a meaningful way.  Ishare  the  concern  that  resource pressures will  lead to a modestacceleration of  inflation.  We went back  and  looked in a little moredetail  than usual at  the experience  of  the mid-1960s  and the  late1980s.  Those years  involved long periods  of  labor market  tightnessthat  in  our judgment  were perhaps  comparable  to what we have beenexperiencing recently.  What we  saw was  that  those periods wereassociated eventually with  an  acceleration of  inflation.  Of  course,what happened back  then is  not  independent of  the  policies that  werepursued, and we  have  to be  careful about  causality and all  of  that.Nevertheless,  the  data  suggest  the risk  that  more  inflation  is  intrain and that  it will  emerge  eventually.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman,  the economy  in theSecond District continues  to  pick up,  so  the positive developmentsthat  I began  to  record two  meetings  ago  for  the  District continue.Payroll  employment in  the private  sector accelerated  in July  to  annualgrowth rates  of  1.2  to  1.5  percent  in New York State, New Jersey,  andNew York City,  In August, New Jersey  increased its  rate  of  gain to2.1  percent.  The  real  estate markets  also  reported renewed vigor.Permits  for new home  construction  and contract  awards  fornonresidential  construction rose  sharply  in  July  and continued a trendof  favorable year-over-year comparisons.  More  recently, New York Cityand northern New Jersey realtors  reported that  sales  of  existing homesrose  8 to  10  percent  in August  and  early September  compared to  thesame period  in  1995,  and  floor  traffic,  we  are  told, has  remainedheavy recently.  Consumer  spending has  firmed.  New York and NewJersey  officials reported  5 percent  gains  in  August  retail  sales  taxcollections, while  New York City reported an  8 percent  gain  on a year-over-year  basis.  That  rate  of  increase  has  risen  steadily  since9/24/96-17-consumer expenditures  over  the  summer months.  The  securities  industryis very healthy;  one  of  the major  firms  reported a 39  percent gain  inpre-tax profits  for  the  third quarter,  and we are hearing from theothers  that  they will be  reporting very  good gains  as well.  In  theinflation area,  the news  is  very good,  indeed.  Consumer priceinflation in  the New York-northeastern New Jersey area was unchangedin August  at  2.7  percent  on  a 12-month basis.  That  compares  to  anational  gain  of  2.9  percent.  August  is  the  fifth consecutive monthin which  the region's  rate  of  inflation has  been  less  than  3 percent.At  the national  level,  we  agree with everyone  that  growth  isclearly moderating from  the  3.3  percent  first-half pace.  We  share  thesense  of  confusion  caused by  the divergence  between the  demand sideand the  supply side  in  the  incoming data, but  taking  account of  aninventory boost,  we  think that  growth will be around  2 percent  forthis  quarter.  In  comparing our  forecast  to  that  in the  Greenbook andassuming the present monetary policy, we have real  GDP growth slowingnext  year to  1.7 percent.  The Greenbook has  it  slowing to  2.1percent.  We  are  slightly more  optimistic  on inflation.  We have  thecore  CPI  creeping up  and just  touching 3 percent  in the  fourth quarterof  next  year.  There  is  no question about  the risk of  more  inflationif  the  rate  of  wage  inflation continues  to move up and the pricediscipline  that we  have  seen does  not persist.  We have  to  beconcerned  about  that  risk.  On the  other hand, I think we have  equalreason  to believe  that  the  inability of  businesses  to  increase priceswill  continue,  that  the  cost of  benefits will  remain a positive factorin holding down  the rise  in  overall compensation costs,  and that  wageearners,  including those with high-level  jobs, will  continue  to preferjob  security rather  than wage  increases.  I believe  that  the conductof  the  United Automobile Workers  provides  very important  evidence  inthat  direction.  For  quite a number of months, we have  been acceptingthe risk that  these  phenomena will  persist,  that  prices will  continueto be well  behaved because businesses can't  raise  them,  and that wageearners will  continue  the behavior  that  they have  shown for  severalyears.  As  a result  of  our accepting  that  risk, and  that  is what  itis,  we have  had the wonderful phenomenon of  high growth and  lowinflation.  That  is  a combination  richly to  be desired.  Thank you.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  After reviewing mycomments  from the  last meeting,  I conclude  that  there has  not  been  allthat  much change.  We are  still  expecting moderate second-half  growth,which would be  a slowdown,  of  course,  from the  first  half.  Theevidence  on  inflation that  came  in  during the  intermeeting periodgenerally has  been  fairly benign, and  I would point  to  the coreindexes  and to  commodity prices  in particular.  I asked myself what,if  anything, we  know that  is  new since  the  last  meeting.  At  best,  itseems  to me  that  the  news  is  fairly marginal.  On balance,  the  signsof  the  second-half  slowdown appear  to  be  a bit more  solid, but  not  allthat  much.  Consumer spending has  slowed, but now we are seeing  signsthat  it  may be  turning back up.  Housing has  been  a bit  difficult  toread,  given  that  the  starts  number  for August was  strong.  We  continueto  think  that  we  are poised  for a slowdown in  housing  demand becauseof  the  backup  in  long-term  interest  rates,  but  housing has  held upsurprisingly well.  Consumer credit  seems  to  be  slowing a bit,  to  apace more in  line with  income growth, perhaps  as  consumers  take9/24/96-18-cognizance of  increasing repayment  requirements  associated with higherdebt  levels.  Nonresidential  construction is  showing mixed signs.  Netexports  appear  to be  a bit of  a drag on  the  economy.The  areas of  strength  that we  have talked about  in  theeconomy are  still  in evidence.  The  labor market  is very strong;unemployment  is  low;  consumer  confidence is  up, perhaps  fed by thestrength in  employment.  The manufacturing outlook seems  stronger.Business  fixed investment also  is  poised for  substantial  growth,perhaps not  at  a double-digit  rate, but  it  remains a solid contributorto  real  growth.  One bit  of  news  relates  to  corporate profits.  At  ourlast  session,  there was  a fair amount  of  discussion about whether theywould hold up.  They do appear to  be holding up better  than might havebeen anticipated if  one  were assuming  that  increases  in wages wouldresult  in  a profit  squeeze  unless  firms  were able  to pass  on  theincreases  through higher prices.So,  while it  appears  that  the  signs  of  a slowdown arebecoming a bit  more evident  in  consumer  spending and construction,there  is  still  growth--just  slower growth.  The areas  of  strength thatare  prevalent  in  the  economy should also prevent  that  slowdown  fromcareening  into negative growth.A bit  more monetary restraint  is  being provided by therates,  including mortgage rates.  The  stock market has  actuallyrecovered.  That means  that  the cost  of  capital  is  down, and thatargues  for  continued business  investment.  Banks  are continuing  tosupport  growth with credit  availability, and I might  mention thatbanks  are  doing  quite well.  They are making money!On  the  inflation front,  the  laws of  gravity appear  to  beholding greater  sway than  the principles of  economics.  At some point,we  have  to  expect  that  labor  costs  are  going to  feed  through  toprices.  If  they do not,  either profits  are being  squeezed, which doesnot  appear to  be  the  case,  or productivity must be  improving, whichshowing  the  improvement.  There  is  considerable analysis  of  andcomment  on  this  inconsistency in  academic papers  and  also  in  thepress.  The explanations  tend  to  concentrate  on  the  continued effortsto  downsize business  firms,  lower  health  insurance  costs--some of  thatimprovement may be  permanent--additions  to  industrial  capacity andother  fixed investments,  the  inability  to pass  on price  increases,  andperhaps  a breakdown  in  inflation psychology.  Consumers  appear  to  bequite price conscious.  If  all  this  is  true,  there may even be  someroom  for optimism on  inflation, but  it  seems  to me  that  this  is  pureconjecture and we  really cannot  dismiss  the  tightness  in  laborproductivity.  In  sum,  I think we  are  about where we were  last month.We  know more but  the new  information  is marginal.  We  still  appear tobe  on  a sustainable  growth path as  we  look  for  further confirmation ofa slowdown.  The  inflation news  has  been better, but  if  economichistory repeats  itself,  the risks  are  on  the  up  side.  So,  we mustcontinue  to  be  alert  to  inflation pressures.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.9/24/96-19-

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The data  that havebecome available since  the August meeting have provided a quiteinteresting set of  crosscurrents.  On  the  one hand,  the data indicatethat growth has  slowed much more  sharply in  the  third  quarter  than  Ipreviously expected, moving down  to  a pace  close  to  trend.  Moreover,the apparent mix between  final  sales and  inventory  investment  suggestsa diminished prospect  for above-trend  growth  in the period  immediatelyahead.  On  the  other hand, the  August employment reports  suggest  thatlabor markets have become  even  tighter, raising the  danger of  a stillfaster acceleration of wages  and  therefore increasing the  risk  ofhigher price  inflation  going  forward even  if  growth has slowed totrend.  Thus,  the  case  for tightening  to  slow growth to  trend hasdiminished in my judgment, while  the case  for  tightening  to  counterinflationary utilization rates  may have  increased.  Well,  it nevergets  easy.  At  the  same  time,  the  August CPI  and  PPI  reports challengeus with further evidence  that  core  inflation continues  to  edge  lowerdespite utilization rates  that  historically would already have beenassociated with rising inflation.  Let  me elaborate  on  these  twoissues,  beginning with the prospects  for growth.While  I am comfortable with  the broad outline  of  the path  forreal GDP in  the Greenbook  forecast,  I would have been a bit moreaggressive  in  lowering my forecast  for  third-quarter growth.  Therewere  three  significant  reports  since  the  last meeting that  suggestslower  growth:  the August retail  sales  report,  the July  constructionput-in-place  report,  and the  July  foreign trade report.  Cathy, youmentioned  earlier that you were concerned  that consumer  spending mightbe  even  stronger than  in  the  Greenbook  forecast.  My concern would bequite different.  I suspect  that  consumer spending  is growing at  least1/2 percentage point more  slowly in  the  current quarter  than  theGreenbook  is  projecting.  So,  I think  the  central  tendency right  nowappears  to be  growth around trend, and  I would even  say there  areabout equal  chances  that  third-quarter GDP growth will  be below trendas  above  trend.  While  the  details  of  one quarter  are  of  littleimportance  to  our  task here,  the  sharpness  and widespread nature ofthe  softening of  demand in  the  third quarter might  make us  cautiousabout  the  timing  of  the  tightening  that  still  appears  to  be the mostlikely direction  of  policy going  forward.  I expect  an  increase ofonly 1 percent  in  final  sales  in  the  third quarter compared to  4percent  in  the previous quarter.  At  the  same  time,  production-sidedata--payroll employment,  aggregate hours,  and industrial  productionin particular--look stronger.  The  contrast  between  the  softness  indemand and  the  strength  in employment  and production is  likely  to  bereconciled with strong  third-quarter  inventory growth consistent withthe  rapid inventory buildup reported for July.  However,  if  therebound  in  inventory investment  leaves  the  third-quarter growth closerto  2-1/2  percent  in  the  context of  softening  final  sales,  the prospectof  slower  fourth-quarter growth becomes  still  more  persuasive.I think  the  most  important  implication  of  the developments  inthe  third quarter may be  that  the  unexpectedly sharp  slowing in  thegrowth of  final  sales  has made  room  for  a rebound in  inventoryinvestment  to  a trend  level,  perhaps  removing the  danger thatinventory building will  sustain above-trend growth  in  coming quarters.My  strong expectation  is  that  we  are  in  a temporary lull.Fundamentals  do not  suggest  to  me  a serious  likelihood  that  theexpansion  is  tiring  to  the  point  of  slipping  into protracted below-trend growth.  Indeed,  I  continue  to  expect  that,  with an  unchanged9/24/96-20-policy, growth will be  near  trend or  slightly above  in  comingquarters.  Nevertheless,  the  sharpness of  the weakening  in  final  salesin  the  third quarter adds  a cautionary note  to  this  forecast  andprovides the  rationale  for waiting  for data  to confirm  the expectedstabilization  in  final  demand.Second, utilization rates:  The  decline  in  the  unemploymentrate  to  5.1  percent  in August was  another  significant piece  of data.It  suggested  that  the  labor market may have  tightened in August  fromthe  5-1/2  percent  area over  the  last couple  of  years,  to  a 5 to  5-1/4range  in the  period immediately ahead.  There  are good  reasons  tobelieve  that  the decline  in  the  unemployment rate  in August wasexaggerated,  for example,  because  of  the  late  survey date.  But  thereis  also reason to  believe  that  the  above-trend growth over  the  firsthalf has  left  a legacy of  somewhat  higher utilization rates  goingforward.  The  staff  completely discounts  the  August decline in  theunemployment rate  as  a statistical quirk and assumes  that  it  will  bereversed in  coming months.  As  a result,  they project  the  same  5.4percent  unemployment rate  going forward as  in  their  last  forecast.The difference between a shade below  5-1/2  percent  and  a shade  above 5percent  is  a very important  one  to me.  Personally,  I might buyprovisionally into a NAIRU as  low as  5-1/2  percent.  I do not  buy intoa NAIRU as  low as  5 percent.  As  a result of  the August  employmentreport,  there  is  more uncertainty about  the degree of  labor markettightness, and in my  judgment  the danger  of higher  inflation goingforward  is  also  somewhat  greater now than earlier.Third, a word on  inflation performance:  The  12-monthinflation rate,  as measured by  the  core  CPI,  declined to  2.6  percentin August,  a tenth  lower  than  in  the  previous four months,  and  it  has12-month core  PPI  inflation  rate was  1.4  percent  in August,  close  tohalf  the pace  at  the end  of  last  year.  Not  only has  inflation notbegun  to  rise,  but by some measures  it  has  continued  to  decline.While monetary policy should be  forward-looking, the disparity betweeninflation performance  and  inflation forecasts  looking backward mighttemper our aggressiveness  in  adjusting policy in  response  to  forecastsof  higher  inflation,  at  least until  inflation  stabilizes.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In  reviewing  the  datathat have  accumulated  since  our  last  meeting, I find myself  in  roughagreement with  the Greenbook's  assessment.  The evidence  clearlypoints to  a reduction  in  the momentum  in aggregate demand with  aslackened pace  of  spending growth now likely in  consumption,government  spending,  and residential  investment  during  the  currentquarter.  With the pace  of  final  demand now moderating,  the upsiderisks  from  inventory  investment are  also  reduced.  On balance,  itseems  likely that  demand growth will  revert  toward trend  in  comingquarters,  with  the  risks  to  that  forecast  roughly balanced.The primary problem that  confronts  us  is  that  labor marketsare  already  tight,  and  during the  assumed transition  to trend growthslack  is  likely to  diminish  even  further.  We  thus  appear  to  be  oncourse  toward a landing that  is  ideal  except  for  the  fact  that  we  arenow poised  to  hover  above  the  runway without  actually  touching down.[Laughter]  Even  if  we  agree with  the  Greenbook's  argument  that  the9/24/96-21-be  interpreted literally, it  does  seem evident to  me that  the  laborseem  consistent with the  anecdotal  evidence.  It  is  not uncommon tohear  that  it  is  now  "impossible" to  find qualified  entry-levelworkers,  whereas  six months  ago  the word  "difficult" would have beenused more  frequently.  At  a recent Dallas  board meeting that  Iattended, one  director described the pressures  that  an  inability tohire  entry-level workers  was placing on  supervisors who were  forced towork  overtime.  He  explained  that quit  rates were rising among hissupervisors as  a consequence.  I think  this  is precisely  the  type  ofanecdote  that  one would expect  to hear  at  the  onset  of  an  inflationaryepisode.  If  widespread pressures of  this  type  emerge,  it  seems  likelythat  firms eventually will  be  forced to  bid up wages  to  retain workersand  then pass  through higher unit  labor  costs  to prices.  At  the  sametime,  though,  the  current  episode has  some unique  features.While  the  labor market  is  tight,  job  insecurity also  seemsalive  and well.  Real  wage aspirations  appear modest,  and thebargaining power of  workers  is  surprisingly  low.  Although there  isupward pressure on  entry-level wages, more  senior workers  andparticularly those who  have earned wage premia  in the past, whether  itis  due  to  the power of  their  unions or  the  generous  compensationpolicies of  their  employers,  seem  to be  struggling to  defend theirjobs and  to  avoid sacrificing  the perks  they currently enjoy.  I wouldalso  interpret  the UAW negotiations  as  indicating that  we have  agingauto workers who  are  focused on securing  their own benefits  duringtheir lifetimes but  appear reconciled to accepting  two-tier wagestructures with less generous  packages  for new hires.  Of  course, wehear reports  of  continued upward pressure  on wages  in  skilledtechnical  jobs,  but that  should hardly surprise  us because  the wagedifferential  associated with skill  and education has  been wideningsecularly since  the  late  1970s,  most  likely due  to  technologicalshifts  in  the workplace  favoring skilled and disfavoring less  educatedworkers.  And,  of  course, while wage  growth has  accelerated,compensation growth has  increased only moderately because  companieshave offset more  rapid wage  increases with greater health care  costcontainment.  We  may hypothesize  that  that  favorable  trend  is  about  toconclude,  but  anecdotal reports  suggest  that  corporations  remainconfident  of  their  ability to  achieve  further cost  savings.In  contrast  to  past  expansions  that  have  led  to  inflationaryupticks,  capacity utilization  is  not  excessively  strained.  Deliverylags  have not  increased.  The  world economy is  not  in  a synchronousboom.  Firms  still  insist  that  it  is  impossible  to  pass along priceincreases,  and  the behavior  of broad  inflation measures  remainsconsistent with  that perception.  The  dramatic  table  in  Part  II  of  theGreenbook  reveals  no evidence  of  an  intensification  in  inflationarypressures.  Nor  can we  find evidence  that  compensation pressures areeroding earnings.  The markup of  prices  over  unit  labor  costs  in  thenonfinancial  corporate  sector,  for  example, has  not  been  declining,and pressure on profit margins  is  a typical  precursor  of  aninflationary outbreak.  Further, we have yet  to  see  any evidence of  anuptick  in  inflationary  expectations.  I found it  striking that  whenrumors  surfaced that  hinted at  a higher chance  of  a Fed rate  increasetoday,  longer-term rates  rose rather  than  fell.  So,  we may well  be  ata point where  inflation  is  poised to  rise,  but  if  we  are,  I think weare  still  at  an  early stage  of  the  inflationary spiral.  The  anomalous9/24/96-22-behavior of  inflation in  the  face of  seemingly  tight  labor markets  is,of  course, leading virtually  all  economists  to  lower  their estimatesof  NAIRU.For  all  the reasons  that  I have given,  I am  sympathetic  tothe  view that  the world has  changed.  Nevertheless,  let me conclude bysaying that  I would not want  to  carry  such reasoning  too  far.  First,an unemployment  rate of  5.1  percent  lies  near  the  lower  end of  almostanyone's  estimated NAIRU range.  Second, whatever the NAIRU, theunemployment  rate  does have predictive power  for  changes  in  theinflation rate.  The probability of an  increase  in inflation  isclearly higher when  labor market  slack  is  lower.  For  that  reason, Iconclude  that  the  risk of  an  increase  in  inflation has definitelyrisen, and I would  characterize  the economy as  operating  in  aninflationary danger zone.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  The worried  faces  around this  table,  I think weshould remind ourselves, are worrying about  the best  set  of problemsthat we  could think of having.  Central bankers  all  around the worldwould wish for  this  set  of  statistics.  I think that  Mike  Prell  andsome  others, who  have  rightly emphasized  the uncertainty and thedifficulty of  forecasting at  this particular moment,  have overdone  ita bit.  In  fact,  the developments of  the  intermeeting period,reinforcing  those  of  the previous  intermeeting period, have  given usreason for  some  confidence in our  sense  of  what  is  happening  in theeconomy  and in  our  ability to  forecast reasonably well  at  least  in  theshort run.There were three  things that we  thought we knew.  One wasthat  the  economy was growing  strongly but  that  the  expansion waslikely to  slow.  The data  are certainly  consistent with  that  expectedslowdown, especially on  the  consumer  side,  although  it  is  not  certain,as  nothing  is  ever certain,  that  the  slowdown will  last.  The  laborare  something we  ought  to  want, generally  speaking.  We ought  to  wantthe  incentives  that  tight  labor markets  create both for  employers  tobe  as  efficient as  possible  and for  employers  and employees  to  focuson upgrading  the  skills of  new and old workers.  We  need that  badly.Second, we  thought we  knew  that wages would begin  to  creep upin  the  tight  labor market,  mitigating the  long  stagnation  in  wagesthat  we have had.  This has  indeed begun  to  happen, raising  the costof  labor despite  the slower  growth in  the cost  of  benefits.Third, we  thought  that  these wage  increases would begin  to bepassed along  in  price increases  if  the  slowdown in  the  expansion didnot  begin to  take  the  edge  off  the  robustness  of  the economy in  timeto  keep  inflation under control.  We  thought the  risk was  clearly  onthe  up  side  and  that we  should stand ready to  move  quickly  toforestall  price inflation  if  the  economy proved more robust  than wethought.I said  at  the  last meeting  that we might  not  find  the answersall  that  quickly, and  the  evidence  around the  table  is  that  we havenot.  The  behavior of  prices has,  as  people  have pointed out,  beensurprisingly good.  It  seems  to me  that  we  are  still  in  the  situation9/24/96-23-we were  in  at  the  time  of  the  last meeting  of watching very carefullythe potential  for  inflation.  I agree  with Governor Yellen  that we  arein  a danger  zone,  but we  have  not seen higher  inflation yet.  Weshould be pleased, in fact,  that  things  are turning out  as  well  asthey are  and that we have understood the  current  situation as  well  aswe  have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think  I am wellaware  and I am  certainly deeply respectful  of  the  arguments  that wouldsay  that  inflation  is  likely  to rise and  that policy  should move nowor perhaps  sooner  than now to  prevent  it.  Of  course, this  view  isbased, as  we have  been discussing, on  two  central facts--that  theeconomy is very  fully utilized and  that compensation  is  increasing  asa consequence.  These  conditions  clearly exist.I want  no part of  an  inflationary rise.  I am sure  no onehere does.  But  I also  see  a number of  factors  that have  forced me  toquestion whether  such  an event  is  inevitable,  at  least  anytime soon orto  a meaningful  degree.  We  have  been talking  about  all  of  the reasonsin  prior meetings  and again  this  morning in  some detail.  I will  notrun through my  laundry list;  it  is  much the  same as we have beendiscussing.  I would say that  on balance  I just do  not  see theevidence  that moves me  away from  the judgment  that  I have been makingfor  some  time.  There continues  to  be, as  has been discussed, novisible  sign of  rising price  inflation yet.  If  anything,  it  iscontinuing to  go  down,  as Governor Meyer pointed out.  I think  thereare many tell-tale  indicators, precursors,  that would show that  thereare very  few signs  of  inflation actually in  the pipeline.  Unit  laborcosts  are down  from 1995  and they are  forecasted to  go  down  further.Foreign  inflation is  benign.  Inflationary expectations  are  flat.  Wesee very little delivery tightness.  Commodity prices are  flat  todown.  Real  interest rates  are  flat  in a neutral  zone.  And it doesappear that  we are getting  the  slowing  in  GDP growth that  I think wefelt was  essential  to maintain a steady policy.  We will  see how thatdevelops.With all  of  this  said,  I think nonetheless  that  the  risks  areclearly on  the high  side,  and  I continue  to  sit  very lightly in  mychair.  I did not arrive at  this  judgment  easily, but  I would say  thatI believe we  should continue  to  give  this  thing a chance.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Finally, Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Last  night  one  of  theTV news  magazine  shows  had a story about  people who won the mega  buckslotteries, millions  of  dollars,  and ruined their  lives.  [Laughter]That was  a popular thing  to  show  since most  of  us  lose  in  lotteriesand maybe  we  should be  grateful  because  losing helps  us  to get  on withour  lives.  [Laughter]  The  TV show reminded me  that  we  have beenhaving  a  string of  what  appears  to  be  good luck,  although  the  peopleat  this  table  all  know  it  is  the result  of  our  skill  at  managing  theeconomy!  I would like  to  comment  on  the possibility  that  our  luck  maybe  running  out.First,  it  is  clear  that  we  are  seeing  definite  accelerationin  nominal  wages.  Second,  it  also  seems  clear  that  the  acceleration9/24/96-24-is  not now being passed  through to  prices,  and that  is  the best of  allworlds.  A question we have  to  face,  one  of  the questions  thatGovernor Meyer addressed,  is  whether  this  subdued inflation  is  goingto  persist  along with sustained growth  further out.  I have  done aback-of-the-envelope  calculation.  It  takes  70  cents  of  extra spendingper  capita per day  to  increase economic  growth 1 percent.  Now, I usethis  example whenever  a reporter asks me  to  comment  on  the  economicoutlook.  I ask how much  are you going to  spend tomorrow, within 70cents,  and when  they can't give  me an  answer I say  that  I can't  tellthem what economic  growth is  going  to be next quarter.  [Laughter]Without using  the  sophisticated analysis  either of  the  Greenbook orthat  Governor Meyer presented, let me use  some very unsophisticatedmath.In  the  last  four quarters,  the  economy has  grown at  a 2.7percent  annual  rate.  Indeed, the  economy has grown  at a 2.7  percentannual  rate  since  the  fourth quarter  of  1991.  So,  I am  going to  useas  my operating assumption  that we  are  in a 2.7  percent  economy, whichI agree  is  probably above  the  sustainable pace  at  this point.  Even ifwe make  that  assumption and if  we assume  that  the staff  forecast  isright  about  the  third  quarter,  then  in the  fourth quarter we are goingto  need a 1.7  percent  rate of  growth.  If  the  Greenbook forecast  isright  about  the  third quarter and the  fourth quarter,  growth  in  thefirst quarter  of  next  year will  have  to  be  at  a 1.5  percent rate.  Inother words,  just  simple regression  toward the mean,  in addition toall  the  reasons that  Governor Meyer noted,  suggests  that  our  luck onthe  real side  may be  about  to  run out,  if  we  think of  this  lotterydrawing as  the number  from the  BEA.  But who knows?  They may deliveran  extra  B-2  bomber one  of  these  quarters.Similarly, we are  running  a risk that  our luck  is  going  torun  out  on  the  inflation side.  In  the  last  year,  the  monthly CPIincrease has  been  .1 percent  four times,  .2 percent  two  times,  .3percent  three  times,  and  .4 percent  three times.  That  is whatinflation at  an annual  rate  of  just under 3 percent  is  all  about.  Itis  essentially  a random number month to  month on which apparentlybillions of  dollars are  being bet.  But  if  we view it  as  a randomnumber,  the  odds  of  our pulling a  .4 percent  number  in either of  thenext  two  months run  just a tad under 50  percent.  That will  be,judging from  the recent  reaction to  the  .1 percent  increase, not  ahappy day.  So,  I think we have  a chance of  seeing  our  luck run  out  onthe  real  side  of  the  economy,  including  inflation.But  that  is  not where  I am most worried.  What  worries memore is  that  our  luck  is  about  to  run out  in  the  financial  marketsbecause  of  what  I would consider  a gambler's  curse:  We  have won  thislong,  let  us  keep  the money on  the  table.  You  can see  early  signs  ofthis.  It  includes  real  estate  appreciation  in  the  Hamptons,Connecticut,  and Manhattan.  BMW  and Mercedes  both had  their bestsummer  in  history in  the  United States.  The  IBES  earningsexpectations  survey  for  5-year projected earnings  hit  a  12-year highin August.  It  indicates  that  earnings  are  expected  to  grow at  a rateof  a  little  over  11-1/2  percent  per year.  Now, if  we  assume  nominalGDP  growth  of  5-1/2  percent  over  the  same  period, this  means  that NIPAprofits will  rise  from  10.7  percent  of  national  income  to  14.3  percentof  national  income  in  2001.  Readers  of  this  transcript  five  yearsfrom now can check  this  fearless prediction:  Profits will  fall  shortof  this  expectation.  Unfortunately, optimism  is  ripe  in  the markets.9/24/96-25-Excessive  optimism is  also necessary to  justify current  levels  of  IPOactivity and valuations  of  highly speculative stocks.  While  it  is  notso  large  as  to  exert undue  pressure on  the real  side  of  the U.S.economy, this  emerging bubble  is  nonetheless  real.  As  a survivor  ofthe  so-called Massachusetts miracle  to  which Cathy Minehan referredearlier,  I can attest  that  everyone  enjoys an  economic party.  But  thelong-term costs of  a bubble  to  the economy and  society are potentiallygreat.  They  include  a reduction  in  the  long-term saving rate,  aseemingly random redistribution of  wealth, and  the diversion  of  scarcefinancial human  capital  into  the acquisition of  wealth.  As  in  theUnited States  in  the  late  1920s  and Japan  in  the  late 1980s,  the  casefor  a central bank ultimately to  burst  that  bubble becomesoverwhelming.  I think  it  is  far better that we do  so  while  the bubblestill  resembles  surface  froth and before  the bubble carries  theeconomy  to  stratospheric heights.  Whenever we  do  it,  it  is  going  tobe painful, however.In addition,  there  is  an associated risk that we  face  everytwo  or  four  years,  and it  is  related to  the bond market.  The marketshave built  in  an array of  rather optimistic  scenarios  for  the effectof  the  upcoming elections  on  the  nation's health.  The dominant  viewis  characterized by a recent missive  from Goldman  Sachs whichpredicted a divided government:  "Continued divided control  ofgovernment in  fact might provide the  ripest political  conditions  for afresh push toward mandatory spending program overhaul  in  the nextCongressional  term, which would have  the  clearest  favorableramifications  for  deficit control  in  the  coming decade."  A secondequally optimistic view was  provided by a friend of  mine who  straddlesboth  the political  and the  financial markets.  He predicted aDemocratic  takeover  of  Congress  and said with regard to  entitlementsreform,  "Look, their  program of  savage cuts  becomes  our saving  thesystem and it  will  get  enacted."  In  this  regard packaging is  all  thatmatters.  It  is  what we  might  call the  Japanese business gift  theoryof  politics.In  short,  the markets  now have built  into  them a veryoptimistic view of  what  is  going  to happen after  November  5.  They maybe  right no  matter what  happens.  I think there  are  two  reasons  todiffer.  The  first  is  polarization and  the second is  party parity.Any look at  the political advertisements  now running makes  clear  thatthe new Congress  is  going  to  be  fairly polarized.  I see  two  types  ofmembers:  those who  got  there  by accusing  their  opponents  of  wanting tothrow granny out  in  the  snow and  those who survived  by vociferouslydenying  that  they wanted to  throw granny  out  in the  snow.  How iseither  going  to  enact  Medicare or  Social  Security reform?  Second, nomatter which party controls Congress,  the margin  of  control  is  likelyto  be  a relative handful  of  seats.  This  creates  a very  interestingdynamic.  The majority will  be  ill-inclined to  take  risks  for  fear  oflosing  its  status.  The minority will be  both hungry  and embitteredand quite unwilling  to  help  the majority  shoulder  the responsibilitiesof  governing.  That  is  not  an  optimistic  recipe.  Now, it  may be  thatthe  optimists  in  the  bond market who believe  these  optimisticscenarios  are  right  and  that  the people  are  going  to  send  onlystatesmen  to  Capitol  Hill,  just  like  they have  every two years.  Inthis  scenario we,  the  bond market,  and  the country have  nothing  toworry  about.  But  if  the  optimists  are  wrong,  then  indeed not  only  ourluck but  that  of  the markets  and  of  the  economy has  run out.  Thankyou.9/24/96-26-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?  If  not,  let me getstarted.  If  we  cut  through the  somewhat  foggy data  for  the  thirdquarter, I think that  there  are  two  important hard numbers  thatemerge.  One  is  that  no  matter how we  look at  the numbers,  it  is  verydifficult  to  get  around the  fact  that hourly wages and salaries  areaccelerating.  We have no  third-quarter  data  on  fringe benefit  costs,but  as  I indicated  in  the August meeting  in  support  of  the  views ofthe  Vice Chairman, I think  that health cost  increases  are  still  on  theway down and  still basically holding  down overall  compensation costs.Wage pressures  are unquestionably the  result of  the  tightness  in  thelabor  markets that we  have  all  seen,  and that  tightness by everyindication has  increased rather than  decreased  in recent  months.  Itis  conceivable  that  there are  seasonal  factor  adjustment problems  inthe  unemployment  rate,  and I do not  doubt  that  that  is  the  case.There  is  also  a sampling variability issue, which is  not  to bedismissed very readily,  in  the  household  sample figure.  But  theinitial  claims  and more  specifically the  insured unemployment numbersare  not  inconsistent with  some  tightening in  labor markets  in  the  lasttwo  or  three  months.The  second very important  hard number may be  somewhat lesshard than  usual and  is  one  that  Governor Phillips pointed to,  namelythat  profit margins  seem  to be  holding up  in  the  third quarter.  Inany  event,  the  evidence  that  they may be  declining  is  not  verypersuasive.  This means  that  the  rise  or  acceleration in  compensationhas  to  show up  as  it  has  historically either  in  increasing prices  orincreasing productivity growth.  I am  talking about  the third quarter,which  is  just  about history at  this  stage.  The  performance on  theprice side,  I think,  is  very impressive.  You  cannot  find priceincreases  of  any  significance  in  the  core CPI,  which went up  .06percent  and not  .1 percent  in August,  if you want  to  look at  somenumbers  to  disbelieve, and  I must  say that  I do not  entirely believethem.  Data  relating to  underlying inflation  in  the pipeline,  as  Ibelieve Governor Meyer pointed out,  show nothing.  The pickup  that  weare  getting  in  the  Chicago Purchasing Managers'  Survey,  as  far  as  Ican see,  is  in  oil product prices,  which  show up across  the board  inthose  surveys,  and we  are  seeing them  elsewhere.  I do  not  take  theprice  data  in the  purchasing managers'  surveys  as  very useful,  largelybecause we  have  far better  data  for  the  actual  commodities  that  arebeing purchased.  The purchasing managers'  data,  I am almost  certain,are  coincident with  the  rise  in  oil  product  prices and  futures.The  difficulty that  one has with all  of  this  is whetherprices will  remain generally  stable.  I must  say  that  I do  not  expectthe  September  CPI  to  be  as  benign because  it  will  include  the  10percent  excise  tax  for  airlines,  and  it  is  likely that  the  1-1/2percent  decline  in  apparel  prices  for August  will be  largely reversed.Those  two  factors  in  and of  themselves  can very readily  turn  the CPIaround.  I must  admit  that  I would be  quite  surprised  if we  did notget  a significant  uptick in  the  core  CPI  in  the  September numbers.9/24/96-27-The question we  are  dealing with is whether  the price/profit-difficult  to  make a judgment about  whether the productivity numbersare  improving, it  is  not difficult  to make  a judgment  that  the  rate ofincrease  in productivity  is  a lot  higher than  is  shown by theconventional  numbers.  At  the August meeting, I raised a questionabout  the internal  inconsistency between  the manufacturing data  andthe changes  in total  nonfarm business productivity.  Since  thatmeeting, we have done  a fairly  extensive  amount of  statisticalevaluation and  have made  some very interesting findings.  The  first  isthat  if  we disaggregate productivity in  the nonfarm business  sectorinto  corporate and noncorporate,  the corporate  data  are generally  notbad,  though one must make  a judgment with respect  to  how one  price-deflates  the gross  corporate product.  Nonetheless,  the  figures  thatare derived are  far more consistent with the  anecdotal data  that wesee  on  a day-by-day basis  in  the press and  that we hear when we talkto  anybody  in the  corporate  sector, namely  that productivity growth isa lot  stronger  than  the  1 percent or  less  that we have  seen  in  thenonfarm business product  data.  In  fact,  the number  for  the  last  fourquarters  is  2.6  percent  at  an  annual rate;  since  1980,  it  is  1.6  to1.7  percent,  well  above  the nonfarm business product  numbers.  Indeed,when we  separate  out both  the nominal  and the  real  noncorporatenonfarm  data, we  find  something quite  startling  in those  data, namelythat  measured productivity growth in the  noncorporate  sector isnegative  and has had a negative  trend since  1980.  The reason for  thisobviously is  the price factors  that  BEA uses.  When we disaggregatethe  Gross  Product  Originating data  to  two-digit SIC  industry detailfor those  industries  that  tend  to be  in  the noncorporate sector,namely services, we get  full  confirmation.  Taking  the new GPO byindustry data  through 1994  just  published by Commerce  and applyinghours  data, we  get productivity for  total  services, which is  a fourthof  gross  business  product, declining  1.4  percent per  annum since  1990,health  services declining  at  a rate of  2.7  percent  for 1990  to  1994,legal  services  at  a rate  of  1.6  percent--that  is  a more  crediblenumber  [Laughter]--and  social  services, which are  a large  sector,This  tells  us  that  a large  chunk of  the productivity data  inthe  nonfarm business  product  area makes  no  sense  and is  giving us  adistorted view  of  the  underlying productivity growth rate  in  theeconomy as  a whole  and a distinctly distorted  view of  underlying realcosts.  If  we  look at  the data  on  the  corporate sector,  even  presumingthat  the  inflation  rates  in  that  sector  are misestimated, we  still  getsome very persuasive productivity numbers.  For  those  who have  beenbrought up believing  that  productivity rose  quite  substantially  from1960  through  1973  and then took  a swoon,  these data  show  that  when weuse  income-based statistics  to  disaggregate  the  nonfarm businessproduct data,  which  show a decline  from a 3 percent annual  rate  in  the1960s  to  1.1  percent  now, virtually  all  of  that  decline  inproductivity growth shows up  in  the  nonfarm, noncorporate  area.Productivity  in  that  sector  rose at  a 5 percent  annual  rate  from 1960through  1973  and has  been negative  on  average  since  then.  The annualrise  in  productivity in  the  corporate  sector went  from 2.2  percentduring  the pre-1973  period  to  1.7  percent  since  then.  In  other words,the  tremendous  contraction  in productivity,  which all  of  our  datashow,  is  partially phoney.9/24/96-28-The result  of  all  of  this  is  that  if  we  look at  theunderlying cost  structure  and  adjust  for  the bias  in service prices,which  is  obviously  the  source  of  this  problem, we get an  increase inreal  gross product  for  the noncorporate  sector, an  increase  inproductivity,  and the  numbers  all make  sense,  assuming that  theoverall price  index  comes  out  lower  than  implied by the  publisheddata.  If  we  look at  the current  structure  of  costs, hourlycompensation  for  the corporate  sector  and probably for  the  wholeeconomy is  going up  3-1/2  percent  per annum.  If  output per hour  forthe  overall  economy is  going up  1-1/2  percent, which  seems  a lot morelikely than  the  reported numbers,  unit  labor costs would be rising  2percent.  Multiplying unit  labor costs by  .7 percent,  the  generalproportion of  labor  costs  in  total  costs,  results  in a contribution tototal  costs  of  1.4  percent  from  the  rise  in  the  compensation ofemployees.  Other  costs  are going down:  Indirect business  taxes  perunit  of  output  are moving  lower as  are net  interest  costs.  In themost  recent  period, these  declines average  about  1/2  percent,  sogrowth in  underlying total unit  costs  is  somewhere  in  the  area of  1percent.  This  explains why profit margins  are  large and holding, andit  explains why price pressures  are  nowhere near  as high as  we wouldordinarily expect  them  to  be  at  this  stage of  the  business  cycle  inthe  context of  laggard productivity growth.The question that  one  must  ask  in all  of  this  is  how toexplain  the  extraordinary behavior of  prices when wage  increases arevery  clearly accelerating.  The  answer is  that we can  explain it  onlyif  productivity is  indeed rising a lot  faster  than  our  statisticsindicate.  If  we  look at  the  total  cost  structure, I grant  that  atthis  stage  it  is  virtually impossible  to  make a judgment  as  to  whetherproductivity growth  is  accelerating, but  it  is not difficult  to make  ajudgment  that underlying unit  costs  are  rising at  a very marginalrate.  The evidence  that we  see  of  declining unit  labor  costs  inmanufacturing is  a little  dubious because  the hours  in  the personnelservices  area  that  are  used in  manufacturing are  not adjusted in  thosedata.  But  even  with those  adjustments, manufacturing, which is  a bigchunk  of  the  corporate sector  and  indeed probably far morerepresentative  of  what  is  going on  in  the  real world  than  some of  theservice  areas in  the  noncorporate sector,  is  showing a cost  structureeven  more benign  than the  total  for  all  corporations.If  this  analysis  is  in  fact correct,  it  is  important  for  usto  take a look at  what  it  implies  about the  current performance of  theeconomy and  the underlying  inflationary  forces.  While the  probabilityis  still better  than  50/50  that we will  not  get  through  this periodwithout  the very  strong pressure on wages  overcoming  the  productivityadvances  and engendering  a much higher  rate  of  expansion  in total  unitcosts,  I think  the probabilities  are  falling.  Indeed,  there  is  a notinconceivable probability  that  we  could get  through  this  period intothe  early months  of  next year without  moving policy.  The  reasons  areas  follows.One,  as  Governor Meyer  said  and as  I implied in  the Augustmeeting, the  inventory data  appear  to be moving  around.  We  know thatthe  July change  in constant  dollars  is  at  almost  a  $50  billion annualrate.  The  August  figure  is  substantially less.  We  know that  from  thenumbers  for motor  vehicles,  but  we  are  also picking  it  up  in  someother  indications  for August  inventories.  One  stems  from  a method  forestimating  inventories on  the  basis  of  industrial production that  is9/24/96-29-not  too bad a predictor  of  inventories before  they are  published.Another comes  from a model  based on C&I  loans and  some  judgment withrespect  to  how commercial paper  issuance  relates to  the  financing ofinventories.  That  also  shows  a somewhat  lower  rate  of  Augustinventory accumulation but a higher rate  in September.  The  problemhere  is  not  that we  are getting  an excessive buildup of  inventories.Even with a fairly substantial  expansion  of  inventories--and the  rateof  inventory  investment is  now up  significantly  from where  it was  inthe second quarter--we would need a long period of  this  type ofinventory investment to  get  an  inventory overhang.  It  is  not  that.  Isuspect  that  inventory-sales  ratios  are still  not very high even atthe  end of  September.  The  issue  is  that  the  level  of  output  is  beingdriven by higher inventory  investment.  As  a number of  you  havementioned, that  takes  some of  the pressure off  the  fourth quarter andthe  first quarter of  next  year.  The  issue  is  not whether  inventoryaccumulation  is  voluntary or involuntary;  it  is  just that  it  is  there.If  it  is  there,  it  affects  the  arithmetic  of  the  growth in GDP.Secondly, while  the August  retail  sales  figures may bedubious,  I do not  think the revisions  going back into June  and Julyare.  They show a significant slowing, which as  best we  can  judge  isalso  occurring in  September.  Mike  Moskow points  out  that  motorvehicle  sales  for  the  first half  of  this  month are at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate  of  15.1  million.  We get  the same number here  andthat is  a significant decline  from  the August  level.  Part  of  that maywell be  fleet  sales,  but  it  strikes me  in  looking at  the  distributionbetween  fleet  and retail  sales, which is  roughly  a PCE/producersdurable  equipment  split,  that part  of  the motor vehicle number isclearly  in the  retail  sales  area.  We also received a set of  weeklychain-store  sales data  this morning.  If  the data  are to  be  believed,the September  seasonally adjusted numbers  are well  under  the Augustnumbers.  Now, I am a little suspicious  of  the way those  numbers  run,largely because  they have not been  that  reliable  in  the past.  Butthey give  some indication  that,  at  this  stage,  we are  not getting apickup  in consumer  expenditures  despite the  fact  that  the consumerconfidence numbers  are  quite strong.  The  Conference Board numbercirculated this  morning was  down  just  a small  fraction;  the MichiganSurvey  looks  strong;  the  ABC numbers  look strong;  and capital  gainsand the wealth  effect  are  strong.  Yet, with  all  of  that  in  thebackground, where are  the  sales?  Now, one  can readily argue  that  thedip  in  sales  is  only  temporary and  sales  will  come  back, and that  is  acredible  forecast.  It  also might be  that  consumer  credit, which hasbeen growing  less rapidly  and getting increasingly  tight,  is  finallybeginning  to  affect  the  consumer data.  I think  it  is  important  todifferentiate between  current reporting and  forecasting.  Currentreports,  as best  I see  the numbers,  are  not  yet  showing the pickupthat  is  implied  in  the Greenbook.  It  may  very well  occur.  We  knowfrom  the past  that  these  numbers  fluctuate  a great deal.  But  for  themoment,  it  is  one  thing  to  forecast  and it  is  another  to  report.Nonetheless,  for  a number  of  reasons  that were  discussedearlier,  I continue  to  believe  that  the probability of  our  having  tomove,  though  declining,  is  still  above  50  percent.  The  first  and mostimportant  reason  is  clearly that  the  labor  markets  are  gettingincreasingly  tight.  It  may be  that we  will  have  the  good  fortune  tofind  that  some  of  the  recent wage data are  an aberration, but  againthat  is  a  forecast.  The  information that we  have  today  suggests  thatthese  markets  are very  tight,  and I am not  aware  of  any  evidence of  a9/24/96-30-letup.  The orders patterns  at  capital  goods establishments are  quiterobust.  The  so-called adjusted real  orders figures  that  we  calculateto  try to  get  a short-term forecast  of  industrial production are quitefirm.  I do not  know of  any evidence  that  says  that industrialproduction is  easing.  The reason production  is  this  strong is  thebuildup  in  inventories.  That  is  where the  impetus  essentially  iscoming from.Housing starts,  home  sales,  and  the  like  are higher  than wewould have  expected at  this  stage.  We have  to be  a little  careful  inour assessment,  however.  As  Mike  Prell pointed out,  a good part  ofthe  increase  in  starts  in August  reflects  a sharp rundown  of  thepermits backlog.  This  suggests that  the  permits  come  first,  thestarts come  second,  and there  have been  indications  that permits  areweakening, although not  as  much as  I would have expected.  I thinkthis  is partly because, if  we  disaggregate home  sales,  it  is  becomingapparent  that home sales  financed by adjustable rate mortgages  arebecoming a more prominent  element  in the  housing market.  Clearly, asinterest rates  rise,  adjustable  rate  home financing goes  up.  Whilecash  sales  still  account  for a small  part  of  the  total,  they do  notseem  to be  doing much.  So,  the  fixed-rate mortgage  is  not  as potent aforce  in reducing home  sales as  it used  to  be  in periods  when mortgagerates  were rising.I mentioned previously that  consumer confidence  is  very high.The  survey data are  showing no  signs  of deterioration.  The stockthat we have  to  be very much aware  of  certain key data as  they comeout  in  the weeks  ahead.  I think the  data relating  to  the  wholeinsured unemployment  system, which show as  I said no  signs  ofsimmering down,  are  crucial  to  our  assessment.  We have  to  be  aware  ofthe possibility, as  I mentioned at  the  July and August meetings,  thatif  we begin to  see  signs  of  some pressures  on  the  product  side  of  theeconomy,  in  intermediate goods  prices,  and evidence  of  tighteningdelivery schedules--the usual  types  of  developments  that  suggest thatthe  economy is  beginning  to  run not  only  into  labor market  tightnessbut production  facility tightness--we  can probably expect  thatinventory  investment  in  safety  stocks  is  going  to  rise  and  risesignificantly.  At  this  point,  even  though the  current rate  ofinventory  investment  is  a lot  higher  than  it was  in  the  first  half  ofthe year,  it  does not  imply any pronounced increase  in  inventory-salesratios.  In  the past, we  have  seen  such an  increase.  If  that beginsto  show up,  it  will  be  indicating  a very  strong  economic boomsuperimposed on  the  expansion  that we  already have.  At  the  moment, noevidence  in  any of  the  data  that  we  look at  suggests  that.  If  westart  to  see  profit margins  erode,  it will  tell  us  that  productivitygains,  which have been  supporting profit margins,  are probably easingand  that price  pressures  are  probably going  to  start  to  show through.That  to  me would be  a very  important  signal  that  the  inflationarydangers are  increasing unacceptably rapidly.I recognize  that  there  is  a stock market bubble problem atthis point,  and I agree with Governor Lindsey  that  this  is  a problemthat we  should keep  an eye  on.  We  have very  great  difficulty inmonetary policy when we  confront  stock  market bubbles.  That  isbecause,  to  the  extent  that we  are  successful  in  keeping product priceinflation  down, history  tells  us  that  price-earnings  ratios underthose  conditions  go  through  the  roof.  What  is  really needed  to  keep9/24/96-31-stock market bubbles  from  occurring  is  a lot  of  product priceinflation, which historically has  tended to  undercut  stock marketsalmost  everywhere.  There  is  a clear  tradeoff.  If  monetary policysucceeds  in one,  it  fails  in  the  other.  Now, unless  we have  thecapability of playing in between  and managing to  know exactly when topush a little here  and  to pull  a little  there, it  is  not  obvious to  methat  there  is  a simple  set  of  monetary policy solutions  that  deflatethe bubble.  We do have  the possibility  of  raising major concerns byincreasing margin  requirements.  I guarantee  that  if  you want  to getrid  of  the  bubble, whatever it  is,  that  will  do  it.  My concern  isthat  I am not  sure what else  it  will  do.  But  there  are other waysthat one can contemplate.This  leads,  as  far as  I am concerned, to  very much  the samepolicy  discussion that we had in August.  If  there  are  indeedaccelerating inflationary pressures,  25  basis points  "ain't going todo  it."  A 25  basis point change used to  be  a mere  indistinguishabletick  in  interest  rate  charts  to which no  one  ever paid much attention.Despite  the possibility that  the markets may assume, if  we were  tomove  25  basis points,  that  that would be  it,  I do not believe  it.Nobody  is  going  to  believe  that  25  basis points will  accomplishanything.  The minimum adjustment needed  to  have  any effect  is  50  to75  basis points.  We  could have moved 25  basis points  in August, as  Iindicated then,  if previous policy had been on  a tightening path.  Buta move  then,  and I must  say now, would be  a reversal  in  trend andwould  imply in my  judgment  that  it  eventually would have  to  total  atleast  50 basis points, probably more,  and I am  sure  that  the  latterwould be priced  into the markets  fairly quickly.  This  expectation  offurther action  unfortunately requires us  in my view to be  morecautious  than  we would like  to  be  if  we were  dealing with  a whollysymmetrical  approach  to  monetary policy.I would like,  if  we  can possibly do  it  and as  I indicated  instarts  to  come  down.  We are  only  a week  away from  the  fourth quarter.I do not know about  the  rest of  you, but my recollection  is  thatwhenever we are  at  the peak  of  intense demand pressures, we never areable  to  identify  the peak  at  that point  in  time.  It  is  only  inretrospect  that  we identify  it.  So, we  have  to  be  careful  aboutdistinguishing between  history and  forecasts.  My general  impressionis  that  the probability  of  a peak at  this  stage,  as  I said, is  lessthan  50/50  but  growing and  that we  may not need  to move prior  to  theend of  this year.  We  may not  need to move as  we  get  into  1997  if  theeconomy starts  to  look as  it  did in  1995.  That  is  not  aninconceivable  development  as  we  look at  the  data  that  we  have  at  thisstage.  There  is no  evidence  that  the  economy  is  about  to  slip  intorecession.  But  there  is  at  least  a not  unreasonable possibility  thatthe  pressures on  labor markets  as  well  as  on  the  economy generallycould ease  enough  to  reduce  the  current  set  of  pressures.Having  said all  that,  I fully acknowledge  that  we have  a verytight  labor market situation at  this  stage.  I think  identifying thecurrent  situation  as  an  inflationary  zone,  as  some  have  argued, is  aproper  judgment at  this  point.  But  it  is  a zone,  not  a breakthrough,and  I would  therefore conclude  and hope,  as  I did  last  time,  that  wecan  stay  at  "B,"  no change, but  also  if  we make  that  decision  that wecan  retain an asymmetric  directive pending  our  examination  of  the  dataas  they evolve  in  the  weeks  ahead.9/24/96-32-

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Governor Lindsey has  a question.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You have a question?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Just  a question, yes,  about the  productivitynumbers.  President Jordan mentioned that  there  is  a plug  in theemployment statistics  to  cover  changes in  employment  associated withbusiness starts.  That would all  be  in the  noncorporate sector.  Howdo  we know that  overstatements  of  employment  in the  noncorporatesector are not  an explanation  for  the productivity statistics?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Because we have  a separate  set  ofnumbers  for double  checking the  household numbers.  While thehousehold numbers as  you well  know do not  conform to  the payrollnumbers month by month,  it  really  is  quite extraordinary how closethose  two  wholly independent  sets of  employment data come  out  overtime.  It  requires  some major changes  in assumptions with respect  tothe distribution of  employment between corporate  and noncorporate  toundercut  the  conclusions that  these data  seem to  produce.  Theconclusions may be  affected at  the margin, but  if  you  looked at  thesedata and asked  "what if,"  you would have  to make bizarre assumptionsabout  the distribution of  corporate  and noncorporate  hours  to makethis problem  disappear.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman, I support yourrecommendation for  a "B" asymmetric directive.  I believe that was  theproper  judgment to  be  made in  July;  it was  the proper  judgment insince the  last meeting make me  even more convinced  that  this  is  thecorrect  conclusion.  So,  I support  your recommendation because Isupport the  substance.A series of  developments not directly in the  economic  andmonetary policy area  has  transpired since  our last  meeting.  Withoutgoing  into  the details,  because  we are painfully  familiar with  thosedevelopments,  I think this  is  an  appropriate  time  for  the  leadershipof  the  Federal Reserve,  the  7 governors  and the  12  Reserve  Bankpresidents,  to  support a common  judgment as  recommended by  theChairman.  The debate  in  the  earlier part  of  the meeting was verycomplete  and  it  certainly gave  everybody an  opportunity  to  express  hisor  her views.  So,  at  this  stage we  are  able  to  say  that we have  heardone  another  and  the Chairman, whose views,  I believe,  clearly reflecta majority opinion.  So,  this might be  a very good time  to  indicatethat  the  leadership  of  the  Federal Reserve  is  capable  of  pullingtogether.  In my view,  that  would be  of  great  immediate benefit  to  thepeople who work  for us,  whose morale certainly has  been  adverselyaffected to  a serious  extent  recently.  I think  that  it would haveconsiderable merit  in  the  eyes  of  the American public,  whom weultimately serve, when  the minutes of  this  meeting come  out  on Friday,with  the  substance, but  also  for  reasons  that  have  to  do with  acollective responsibility of  leadership, I support  your position.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  This  is  going  to  be  a little more difficult  givenwhat  the Vice  Chairman just  said, but  I would  like  to  indicate  that  Ithink  there  are  a number  of  different arguments  that  can be  put9/24/96-33-forward to  make  the  case  for raising  rates,  and  I am going to  argue  infavor  of  doing that.My first  and  foremost concern  involves  the  level  of  resourceutilization  in  the  economy.  The  economy has  been operating at  a levelsomewhat above  its  long-term potential  for  some  time now.  While  Iexpect growth to  slow, and I certainly  indicated  that  is  our  forecast,I do not  think  that  the  slowdown will  lead  to a reduction  in  the gapbetween actual  and potential  output.  Indeed,  the gap  could well  growlarger over  the  next  few quarters.  At  a minimum, it  is  safe  to  saythat I do  not  see  any  reduction in  inflationary pressures  in  the nearterm.  At  this  time,  inflationary pressures  are  being masked bycertain  favorable developments, most notably the marked slowdown  inthe  growth rate of  health care  costs.  In my view, we  should be usingthis  opportunity to  lock in  lower  rates  of  inflation  instead of  usingit  to  put  off needed action on  interest  rates.Finally, we have  talked at  times  about the  level  of  the  realfunds  rate.  While  this  rate  does not  appear to  be  low by historicalstandards,  the  data  suggest that we  are  in  a period  of  relatively highinvestment demand and perhaps  a supply-driven  expansion that  implieshigher equilibrium real  interest rates.  In view of  theseconsiderations,  I believe  it would be prudent  to  raise interest rates25  basis points  at  this  meeting.  This may not be  the  last  increase wewill  need unless  the  economy slows  down more  than I anticipate.  Thankyou.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman,  I recognize  that  there  arecogent  arguments  on  both sides  of  this  difficult  policy issue.  Butafter  sorting it  all  out,  the basic  message  for me  is  the  onecontained  in  the  Greenbook projection--that  labor markets  arecurrently  tight  enough to  put  continuing upward pressure on  wages,which may eventually feed  into  prices.  This  is  certainly consistentwith what we  are  seeing  in  our District.  I agree  with  the  staff'sprojection  that  if  there  is  no  change  in  policy, it  is  highly likelythat  we will  see  at  least  a moderate  increase  in  inflation.  My ownview  is  that  the  risk of  error  in  that projection is  skewed  to  the  upside.  So,  for  me  that  certainly constitutes an  inflation danger  zone.In  this  situation, I agree with Bob  Parry.  I continue  to  believe  thatthe  Committee  should act promptly and  firmly  to  reduce  these risks  and9/24/96-34-to  hold  the  line on  inflation.  Building on  one  of  your comments, myown concern  is  that  if  we  wait  to  see  profit margins declining,  I donot  know where  that will  put us  in  the  cycle or how much we would bebehind  the  curve.  So,  I would agree with Bob  in  favoring  a tighteningof policy today.  I certainly agree  with you that when we  do move,  1/2point  is  the  right dose.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  This  is  a tough period, and  I have  somesympathy for what  President McDonough had to  say.  But  I do think  thata healthy discussion of  where we all  are should not be  divisive orproblematic  to our  staffs.  In  fact,  I think  the worst message  that wecould send would be  to  stop doing that  at  these meetings becausepeople will  ultimately know about  it.I don't  think  there  is  a question at  this point  about whetherGDP  growth will  slow;  the question is  how much.  Larry Lindsey askedabout  my comment about  consumers.  As  you mentioned, Mr. Chairman,there  is  some reason  to  wonder about  the August  retail  sales data.  Ido  not have  anywhere near as much perspective  on September  sales  asyou do.  But  given the  employment  data, given  the  level  of  consumerconfidence, given  the  rise  in  the  stock market, given  the  lack of  realvisible  restraint on  interest-sensitive sectors and particularly  thehousing markets,  I think there  is  some  risk about how far  GDP is  goingto  slow.  The next  question,  to  the  extent  that  it  does  slow, iswhether that  slowing will  be  sufficient  to  restrain  inflation.You mentioned the  growth in wage pressures.  It  is  clear thatthe  relationship between tight  labor markets  and wage pressures  thatwe  think  exists,  does  in  fact  exist.  The question  is  what  nexusexists between  the  increase  in wages  and the  increase  in  overallprices  and has  that  changed.  It  may be  that  profit margins will  besqueezed, but  I question, as  I think you  do,  how long  that would beallowed to  happen  in  the  atmosphere that  all  of  us  have  seen--or heardof,  anyway--in board rooms  around the  country.  I do  not  think profitsqueezes will be  accepted  for  long.  You  talked  about productivity,and  I totally agree  from what  I know of  it,  which  is  a lot  less  thanyou know,  that  it  is  mismeasured.  I see  that  as  a hands-on  operatingperson, which I have been  through most  of  my career.  I  thinkproductivity  improvements  in  the  service  sector,  of  which we are  apart,  are vastly undermeasured.  Be  that  as  it  may, the  question  iswhether  the  increases  that we  have been  seeing  in productivity,whether we  know what  they are  or not,  will  offset wage  increases  inthe  future.  Now, with  such  tight  labor markets,  productivityimprovements  have  to  accelerate  to  offset  the  acceleration of  wages.Whether  this  will  happen  seems  doubtful  because  markets  are  tight  andbecause we  are  starting  to  pick up more marginal  workers  than we  wereearlier.  This  whole  question is  confusing.  I would assume  that  theimpact  of  the  kinds  of  things  that  go  into  technological  diffusion andhelp  increase productivity and  cut  costs  may not be  as  significantgoing  forward as  they have  been  for  some  time.  So,  I would agree withyou  that when we  begin  to  see  squeezes  on  profit margins,  that will9/24/96-35-indicate the  end of  the  trend where  increasing productivity offsetsincreasing compensation costs.I think the  only place where we do  disagree  is  in our degreeof  willingness  to wait  to  see  that  happen.  There  is  a willingness,  onmy part  anyway,  to move  on the  belief  that wage pressures ultimatelywill not  be  damped by  squeezes  on profits  and by productivityincreases but rather will  show  through  into  final  prices.  I think  therisks  that  that  will  happen need to  be  dealt with sooner  rather thanlater  and that  in  fact we may be behind  the  curve.  It  is  true thatour  inaction  over a period of months has allowed more growth to  occurperhaps  than would have  otherwise, but  if  we are  behind the  curve andwe continue  to  be,  that does not  augur well  for  growth going  forward,given past  history.  In  fact,  once we  experience an  increase  ininflation, we might have  to  move more  than we would if  we started  totighten policy now.  Waiting might  therefore  have  a more negativeimpact on growth  than would a slight  move now.  So,  I would go alongwith  those who  would increase rates  at  this point by either  25  or  50basis  points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  I think there  is  considerablerisk  in waiting.  The  economy has  enjoyed great benefits  from thisperiod  of  low and stable  inflation, particularly given howexpectations  have been affected.  I agree with what Don Kohn saidearlier--namely, that  we should not  lose sight  of  the  fact  that  thecredibility of  the  central  bank may have a very significant impact  onprice behavior right now.  I have been here a good while,  as  have manypeople around this  table,  and  I know how hard it  was  to  earn  thatcredibility.  It  took a long time,  even beginning  in  the mid-1980swhen significant progress had already been made  in bringing  inflationdown.  I really believe  that  it  is  a lot  harder  to  gain and keepcredibility  than  it  is  to  give  it  away.  It  is  not  an issue  as  towhether  the central bank  is  credible  or not;  it  is  not an  ego  issue.It  is  an  issue  with respect  to  the  economy.  If we  are wrong withrespect  to  our judgments  on  the risks  of  inflation,  the  costs  to  theeconomy are  going  to  be  higher down  the  road when we  try  to  catch upwith a moving  train.  If  the  central bank  takes  out  insurance  againstanything,  it  ought  to  be  against  the  risk of  rising inflation,  and Ithink this  is  the  time  to  take  out an  insurance policy.  So,  I wouldfavor an  increase  in  the degree  of  reserve restraint.

I am  intrigued, as  others  I think are,  by yourdisaggregation of  the productivity data  because  it  provides  us  with atleast  a partial  explanation of  the mystery of  why wages  have beenrising, profits have  been holding,  and price  inflation has  not beengoing up.  I hope  you will  give us  a chance  to  see  all  of  this  andwork on  it  further.  I still  think  it  is  appropriate  to worry verystrongly about  inflation.  If we  get  adverse  information in  the  nextfew weeks,  I think we  should be prepared to  reconsider.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman,  I could  support a decision not tochange policy at  this  time,  and  if  I had a vote  this year,  I wouldvote  "yes."  As  Governor Rivlin noted in  the  earlier go-around, we  cantake great pride in  the  low inflation  and the  strong real  activitythat  we have  achieved.  At  previous meetings,  I was  among those whoargued in  favor of  letting  this  thing play out.  I think that  has  beenthe  right thing  to  do.Having said  that,  I have  come  to  the  view that a modestincrease  in our  fed funds  target  rate  is  probably desirable  now orsometime  soon.  In my view, we  do need to  continue  to wonder aboutwhether the  hope  for  a slowdown over  the rest  of  this  year and  intonext  year will  materialize,  at  least  to  the  degree that  we expect  it.Our previous  forecast plainly suggested  the  need for  such a slowdown.However,  my concern  is  now rooted  in the  belief  that  the  rate  ofgrowth that we  have  seen  in recent  quarters--unless we get  a verysubstantial  slowdown--combined with  the  recent pace of  job creation,tight  labor markets,  and relatively high  labor  force participation  areincompatible with stable  inflation over  the  longer run.  This  raises  aspecial concern  that monetary policy may be  accommodating thosetrends.  The  current  stable  inflation performance  suggests  to  me  thatover  the  short  run, policy may not  be  too  expansionary.  Nevertheless,few  if  any of  our  forecasts  conclude  that  inflation will moderateunder  the  current policy scenario.  Indeed,  most  forecasts  includingmy  own suggest  that  inflation  is most  likely to  stabilize at  itspresent  level  or  even  accelerate slowly.  I am convinced  that  therisks  of  inflation are  now predominantly on  the up  side.I believe with  Tom Melzer  that we  currently have  a uniqueopportunity  to  solidify  the  gains  that  we  have made  in  recent years  onlimiting  inflation.  A growing  number of  us  around  this  table andothers outside  the  System are  coming  to  the  view that  the  risks  ofhigher  inflation, a small  uptick at  least,  have  increased.  We  have  achance  to  send  a very  credible  and unambiguous  signal  to  the  economyand  financial  markets  about  our  commitment  to  stem  inflation  andperhaps  to  bring it  down  further over  time.  The economy's  currentstrength  combined with  the  fact  that  markets  have been  expecting  apolicy adjustment  for  some  time  suggest  to  me  that  some  change  couldbe made  at  this  time or  sometime  soon without  causing either  a large9/24/96-37-the  time  is  now or  sometime very soon  to  move against  the  inflationaryuptick that  we are  seeing.  I clearly would prefer  an asymmetricaldirective  if  we  decide to  hold policy  steady.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  My decision at  this  meeting is  more difficultthan at  the past  two meetings.  Indeed, leading up to  this meeting, Iwas  feeling  the pain associated with fence  sitting, hoping the  datawould push me decisively in one  direction  or  the  other.  No  such luck.I believe  that  increases  in  utilization rates  should in general befollowed by  increases  in  short-term interest rates.  That  is,  pro-cyclicality  in short-term interest rates  is  one  of  the most  importantrules of  prudent monetary policy.  If  the unemployment  rate  stabilizesnear  5 percent  and if  the  economy settles  into  trend growth,  I expectI will  be moved to  support a tightening of monetary policy.  I couldmake  that  case  even today given the  increased tightness  of  laborfundamentals  supporting trend  growth ahead.  I could make  the casethat,  even here,  a cautious  step  toward restraint would be prudent.Nevertheless, Mr. Chairman,  I am prepared to  support  yourposition for  three reasons.  First,  there  is  a small risk  that atightening at  this  moment would be badly timed  into a sharp  slowing  inGDP  growth to  below trend in  the  current quarter and  the periodimmediately ahead.  Second, the prospects  of  either higherproductivity growth  or some  compression  in  above-normal markups  goingforward will  give us  some  room  to  clarify both  the prospects  forgrowth and  the degree  to  which labor markets  have indeed  tightened.Third, given  the recently stable or  even declining  trend  in coremeasures of  inflation, failing to  tighten  today does  not  in myjudgment  leave us  seriously behind  the  curve.  That  judgment  isreinforced by the Taylor rule projections  that,  as  Governor Yellenpointed out  at  the last  meeting,  suggest  that monetary policy isappropriately positioned today  in  light  of  prevailing inflation andutilization  rates.I certainly respect the  judgment of  any colleagues  on thisCommittee who would prefer a modest move  toward tightening  today.Nevertheless,  I would second the  wise counsel of  the Vice  Chair andencourage  those  on the  Committee who believe  as  I do  that  the  decisiontoday is  a close  one  and that  either no  change  or  a 25  basis  pointincrease could be  justified, to  join me  in  supporting alternative Btoday.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I was  very struckwith  the  group of  prominent  economists  that  Cathy Minehan  assembled ather Bank.  That  is  in  part because  I learned a lot  of  economics  fromthe  people  in  that  group, and  I do  not  think  that  they are  at  allunrepresentative  of  what  I would consider mainstream academicthinking.  I do  think  that moving  today would be  the  academic  thing todo.  It  would comport  with history.  It  would comport with what  ourmodels  tell  us  is  going  to  happen down  the  road.  But  I also  thinkthat history and academic  analysis  tell  us  that we  face  an asymmetricloss  function  if  we are  wrong.  We  will  pay a higher price  if  we  arewrong  in  terms  of  more  unemployed people  in  1998  or  1999  or  whenever9/24/96-38-than if  we were to  move  today.  Because  of  the academic  respectabilityof  that  argument,  I would respectfully disagree with the  Vice Chairmanin this  regard.  I think  that the  motivations  of  the people  here  arevery, very sound.  I do not believe  that we actually disagree.  It  ismuch more important  that we pull  together  in public  than around thetable.Having said  that,  Mr. Chairman,  I believe  that what  you areproposing is  more reflective of  what  I would call an entrepreneurial,hands-on approach.  I think it  is  built  frankly out  of  self-confidenceand nimbleness,  and you have  earned  the  capacity  to  have  self-confidence  and to  be  a little more  nimble  in  the  conduct  of policy.  Iwill  be supporting  your recommendation based on what  I think is  a verywell-earned reputation of  success.  Where I remain nervous  relates  towhat is  going  to happen  at 2:15  p.m. today, or whenever the magic hourscreens and  the resulting  reaction  is  going to be  quite  instructive asto  our real  long-term problem and  the  challenge facing  this Committee.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I agree  that  it  is  a close  call.  At  the broadestlevel,  the  performance of  the  economy has  been favorable.  It  has  beencharacterized by growth at or  above  trend and by low  inflation.  Inrecent months,  it  appears  that  the  pace of  the  expansion  and demandare  slowing as  anticipated and inflation has been quiescent.  If  Istopped  there,  it  might be  easy.  Yet,  I feel  uncomfortable  and Isuspect  that  comes  as  no  surprise.  The bottom line  is  that  I feeluncomfortable because  of  what  I perceive is  going on  with resourceutilization, particularly in  the  labor market,  and what  I thinkhistory tells  us  about  the  implications  of  that  sooner  or  later  forinflationary pressures.  I would add that,  should we get  someacceleration  of  inflation, I believe  that will bring with  it  somefurther  disruptions  and perhaps  require a policy response  that  willjeopardize what has  been  a very favorable  economic performance.Before  I came  in here  today,  I was  thinking a bit  about  theinstitutional  issues  that  the Vice Chairman  raised.  But  I have to  saythat  I am not  smart  enough to  know how things  are going  to play out  online,  at  least  for  me  and  I do  not mean  to  be  a purist  about  this,  isthe  integrity  of  the process  here.  I continue  to  favor  some policytightening now, and  I personally think a 1/4-point  increase would beappropriate.  You may be  right  that  it  is  going to  take more, but  inmy view it  pays  to  be  humble about  our ability to  forecast  withaccuracy in  these  circumstances,  given  the  lags  in  policy and  theuncertainty about  the  magnitude  of  the  effects  of  policy.  I concludethat  a small  response  is  appropriate  at  this  juncture.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I can  support  yourproposal  to  adopt  an  unchanged policy with an  asymmetric directive  andto  continue  to  evaluate  incoming  data as  it  bears both  on  the  degreeof  momentum in  demand  and the  inflationary pressures  latent  in  thecurrent environment.  But  I find myself  very close to  the  margin  andwould also  have been quite willing  to  support  an  upward adjustment  of25  basis points  today,  had you proposed that.  I can  support your9/24/96-39-proposal  because,  for  the  reasons  that  I outlined earlier and youexplained  in  fascinating detail,  this  is  an unusual  episode.  Ibelieve we are  still  at  quite an early  stage  of  an  inflationaryuptick,  if  indeed this  turns  out  to be  one.  I also  agree  that withdemand moderating and current inflation  stable or  falling, we may endup  deciding that  it  is  unnecessary  to move  the  funds  rate  upward.But having said  that,  I believe  that a very solid case  canalso be  made  for raising the  federal  funds  rate at  least modestly, by25  basis points, on  the grounds  that  the unemployment rate  has notcheddown  further,  the  decline in  labor market  slack is  palpable, and theodds  of a rise  in  the  inflation rate have  increased, whatever thelevel  of  the  NAIRU and the  associated level  of  those  odds.  I believeI am  echoing Governor Meyer in  saying  that  I favor  a policy  approachin  which, absent  clear  contra-indications,  our policy  instrument wouldbe  routinely adjusted  in  response  to  changing pressures on  resourcesand movements  in actual  inflation.  I think  such a response  functionoperationalizes  the  precept  that  the  Fed should ordinarily leanagainst  the wind.  A 25  basis point  increase  in  the  funds  rate  is  asmall  move that  entails only mild resistance  to  the  forces  that  arethreatening  to  blow the  economy off  course.  In my mind, what  goes upcan also  come down, and we  risk an  error  if  we make  the  hurdle  formoving  our policy  instrument  too high.  I am  concerned that  a policyof  maintaining  short-term interest  rates unchanged, in  essencecreating a flat LM curve  in  the  face  of  spending  or  IS  curve  shocks,risks  increasing  the variability of  real  economic outcomes  andserving as  an automatic  stabilizer  in  the  economy.  I see  the  marketsas  doing their part  in moving  longer-term rates  in  response toeconomic news.  But  I think we  can only count  on  those  responses  ifour  own responses are  predictable and we are  perceived as  willing  toplay our part,  too.  My concern  is  that  a failure  to  shift  policy justmodestly in response  to  shifting  inflationary risks  could underminethe assumptions  on which  the markets'  own stabilizing responses  arebased.

MR. BERNARD.  The draft  directive  wording is  on page  13  ofthe Bluebook:  "In the  implementation of  policy for  the  immediatefuture,  the  Committee seeks  to maintain the  existing  degree ofpressure on  reserve positions.  In  the  context  of  the  Committee'slong-run objectives  for price  stability and sustainable  economicgrowth,  and giving  careful  consideration  to  economic,  financial,  andmonetary developments,  somewhat greater  reserve restraint would orslightly  lesser  reserve  restraint might  be  acceptable  in  theintermeeting period.  The  contemplated reserve conditions  are  expectedto be  consistent with moderate  growth of  M2  and M3  over comingmonths."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter Fisher has  laid  out what  seems  tobe a reasonable proposal  on  the  issue  of  our  foreign currencyinvestments.  He  is  requesting  that  we  replace  the  current  12-monthmaturity constraint on  the  investment  of  System  foreign currencyholdings with an  18-month duration constraint.  Before you hold  forthon your positions  on  this  issue,  are  there questions  on his memorandumthat  you want  to  direct  to  Peter?  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I understand the  issue  of  trying  to  get  some ofthese  holdings  off  the Bundesbank's  balance  sheet.  What  are  ouralternatives  in  terms  of  doing  that?  Is  this  proposal  the  onlyoption?  I can  think of  some  theoretical  alternatives,  but  I do  notknow whether  they  are worth much.  For  example, we  could diversifyinto  some  short-term nongovernment  securities  instead of  extending  thematurities  of  our  German government  securities  holdings.  Or we  couldreduce  our position  in  D-marks.  I am just  wondering if  you havethought  about  other alternatives  and what  the pros  and cons might be.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Certainly we  have.  We  have  not  thought  aboutreducing  the  D-mark position.  That  is,  I take  my responsibilities  inthe  investment  of  our  foreign currency  reserves  to be  independent  oftheir  level.  So,  I am  left  with  the  task  of  taking a  given quantityof  deutsche  marks  and  investing  them.  There are  other avenues  andother  conversations  the Committee  can have  about  the  desirable  levelof  our  foreign  currency reserves.  We  have  not  looked  at  that.  Once  Itake  as  given  roughly  the  level  of  foreign currency  reserves  that  we9/24/96-41-have now or  that we  have had on  average  for  the  last  five years,  thereare  only  a few alternatives  that  have  any practicality.  We alreadyhave  about  one-third of our  reserves  on  the  balance  sheet of  the Bankfor  International Settlements.  I see  that as  a rather high number,although we  could go higher.  As  a rule  of  thumb I was  stopping atabout  one-third, but we  could decide on  a larger exposure  to  the BIS.We  could, as  in  fact most  central banks  do,  go  into  the  commercialdeposit market--the Eurodeposit market.  In  effect,  the BIS  is  a veilfor  us.  They are in  the  Eurodeposit market;  we are not.  We  avoid,therefore,  the rather  time-consuming exercise  of  credit assessment.It  is  my sense, but  it  is  a very strong  one,  that we would find ratherawkward  the process of  making  differential  credit  assessments  amongbanks  and taking commercial  bank or  commercial  credit  risks  in thesecurities market and making  relative assessments  about  the  extent  towhich we  should be  exposed to  or  invest  in  individual privateinstitutions.  But  that  is  really the only alternative  that  existstoday.Now, we  have  just begun  to  invest some  of  our  reserves  in  thedeutsche mark repo market,  and I think  there  is  some  room  for growthfor us  in that  market  in  terms  of  our overall balance  sheet.  In mymemo, you will  see  that  I am worried about  our promise  to  theBundesbank that we  would get  off  their balance  sheet  completely.  WhatI am proposing here will  reduce  our D-mark balances  at  the Bundesbankto  about  one-third of  our total  D-mark reserves.  Another  third willbe  in  the German government  securities market  either  in  the  form  ofrepos  or direct  investments, and  about  one-third will  be  in the  BIS.It  is  my hope  that  the  German repo market will  grow and that we  willbe  able  to  push the  envelope  a little more  there  than we  have.  But  ifwe  invest  too much there, we  will  become a rather large piece of  thatuninspiring because  they would involve  taking  on additional creditrisks  and  the credit  assessment process.  We would  face  the prospectof  pulling the plug on private  entities  if  we became concerned abouttheir  creditworthiness.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  What does  extending the  maturity of  our  foreigncurrency  investments  do  in  terms  of  exposing us  to  greater loss?  Thiscomes  to  mind because we  have  this  issue  of  our surplus,  and that getsus  into potential  foreign currency  losses  among other  things,

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It  does nothing unless  the  Board changes  theaccounting  rules,  and we start  marking  the  securities  to market.  Wecurrently do not  mark  the  securities value  of  the  SOMA portfolio,  thedomestic portfolio, to  market.  We  have not marked  to market  thesecurities value  of  the  short-term foreign currency bonds  that  we  holdnow.  There  are  some  strong  arguments  in  favor  of marking  them  toopponent  of  marking the  securities  to  market,  either  the  foreign  orthe  domestic  securities,  out  of  a rather  strong  fear  that,  as  theAccount  Manager,  I would end up  chasing my own  tail  as  the balancesheet went  up  and down  and I moved things  around  to  change  theduration of  the portfolio.  So,  absent a change  in  the  accountingrule, moving  15  percent  of  our  deutsche mark holdings  into  a sub-portfolio  of  German  government  debt  will  have  no  appreciable  impact onprofits  and  losses.  The  huge  impact  will  continue  to  be  the  monthlyrevaluation of  the  foreign  currency holdings  to  translate  them  intodollar values.9/24/96-42-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Peter,  I agree  that we  need  to  get our  deutschethat  even  if  Maastrict  had not put  them  on an euthanasia program.[Laughter]  Eventually, you are going  to  be getting out  of mark-denominated  assets because  there won't be  D-mark assets.  I think theissue  of  how much of  our assets  is  in  the  form of  foreign currencieshas  to  be  addressed sometime,  but  that  is  not  the  issue now.  I alsowould be  very concerned about  the  idea  of buying private assets,although  I think a few major central banks  in  the world  do  that.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  If  I could just  interrupt,  we could not  buy anyprivate  assets  other than bank deposits.  We should have mentionedthat  in  the memo.  It  may be  useful  to  note as  background that,  beforethe Monetary Control Act,  we  could only hold our  foreign currencybalances  in  the  form of  bank deposits.  The Monetary Control  Act  addedgovernment paper.  So,  the  only private assets we may hold, as  Peterhas  said, would be bank  liabilities.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I think that  is  something we need to preserve,[Laughter]  If  the  concept is  to  bring discipline and  toand other central  banks  around the world would be wise  to  do  the  same.On  the  subject of  duration, there are people  around the  table whoknow more  than  I do  about  it  and how to  use  it  appropriately.  Iunderstand that  it  has had a very profound and a very desirable effecton  the balance  sheets of  commercial  enterprises.  It  took  a long  timeto  bring that  discipline  into play.  I remember a period in  the  1980swhen the  question among bankers was,  "Have you seen  Sandy Rose's  lastarticle  on duration  in  the American Banker?"  The  response was,  "Ihope  so." help  in  the  evaluation of  portfolios affected by  interest rate  swings,one  uses  duration as a tool  to manage  risk;  one  should not  do  thingsto  manage duration.  So,  if  we want  to  be  comfortable  about  the wayduration  is  used as  opposed to what  a maturity constraint wouldrequire,  there  should not be  incentives  to  take actions  for  thepurpose of  influencing duration but  rather to manage  the  changes  inthe valuation  of  the assets  in  the  portfolio.  I can  imagine somescenarios where very dramatic  changes  in  interest  rates wouldinfluence duration and  cause  somebody to  think that  something wouldhave  to  be  done  to  readjust a portfolio's  duration.  We would not wantto  do  that.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I would like to  comment on  that.  After  spendingmuch  of  the  last  five  years  looking at  the  foibles  of  other  centralbanks  and  their  investment  strategies  and  trying  to make  sure  that  wedo  not  fall  into  some of  those  traps,  I think there  are  two problems--you point  to  one  of  them--that  can  arise  in  using  any kind ofbenchmark, particularly a duration target.  One  is  the problem  of  toomuch discretion  and the  other  is  the  problem of  too  little.  On  thepotential  problem of  too much discretion,  as  the  memo and  theinvestment principles  in  the  quarterly  report make  clear, we  do nottrade  on  interest  rate  expectations.  We  are  going to  design  thebenchmark and  replicate  it.  Period;  full  stop.The other problem  is  one  of  too  little  discretion:  Are wegoing  to  design a benchmark that  leads  us  to  do  goofy things,  to  churnthe  portfolio  in  order  to maintain a perfect  target duration?  Indesigning what  we  might want  to  do,  I tried to  address  that  problem by9/24/96-43-setting the  10-month  duration target  that  I am telling  the Committee  Iwould intend  to  implement while permitting actual  investments  to  varyover  a very wide  seven-week window on  either side  of  that.Essentially,  the portfolio  can decay for  an entire quarter without ourhaving  to  do anything  to  address or move back  toward a center point.If  exogenous  shocks  occur in  the  market, my inclination--and I hopethe  investment principles we will  be  revising will make  that  clear--would be  as  apt  to  look at whether  the benchmark itself,  the  10-monthtarget, should be  revised as  I would be  to  change our behavior.  Overthe  last  decade  the  single largest move  in  a five-year  interest  ratein Germany was about  250  basis points.  The sub-portfolio  that  we havedescribed in  the memorandum has a 5-year duration  target,  so  it  is  arough proxy for  that  maturity.  A 250  basis point  move would translateinto  a change  of  about  2 weeks, perhaps  a little more  or  a littleless,  in  the average duration of  a sub-portfolio  targeted  at  5 years,and that would translate  in  turn  into a change  of  just  a few days  inthe  overall  structure  that  I am proposing.  The reason for  having thewide  latitude,  if  I may digress,  between the  18-month ceiling  I wouldlike the  Committee  to  set  and  the  10-month  target  is  that  there  are anumber of  factors  that  could lead  the duration  of  the portfolio  tomove away from my intention and  that would be beyond my control asinvestment manager.  The  Germans are  notorious  for not  holdingregularly  scheduled auctions.  So,  we are  always  subject  to  a bigsurprise,  a big  shock,  as  to when an  auction  takes place  and itstiming can move the  duration quite a bit.The other  reason  is  that  I very much want to  separate  thequestion of  intervention and its  size  from  the  question of  how theportfolio  is  managed and what  kind of  limit  the  Committee places onthe Manager.  If  50  percent of  the portfolio  were  to be  liquidatedthrough intervention, there are  different ways  that could be  done.  Wemight liquidate  everything at  the  short  end;  we might  liquidate acrossthe  spectrum.  That  could swing  the duration quite widely,  and I wouldnot want  to  have  too  short  an  overall  limit placed  on  the  portfoliothat would  in  effect,  because  of  intervention, lead  to violations  ofthe Authorization.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Have you  thought about  how the  Bundesbank mightimplement  the  eventual  transition  to  the  new euro?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I have begun to  think about  that.  It  has beenmy assumption  that  we would leave  our deutsche mark holdings unchangedas  they are  transfigured  into  euros.  And when  that  happens, we  wouldthen be  a participant  in  the novel  question of  what  the euro yieldcurve will be--whether,  for example,  German paper will  determine longeuro  rates but  French paper will  determine  the  short  rates.  There  isenough noise  in how that will  work out  that  I cannot  see very clearlyin  my crystal  ball.  That  is  about  as  far  as  I have  gotten.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Can  I ask  a follow-up  question?  Iassume  that  whether  our  deutsche  mark portfolio  becomes a  europortfolio has  to  do with what  we  decide  is  the  key  interventioncurrency.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  The reason  we  are  in deutsche marksis  not because we  love  deutsche marks.  It  is  because  it  is  the  right9/24/96-44-intervention currency  and  therefore we sold  our relatively smallholdings of  French francs,  Swiss  francs, pound  sterling, and so on  andput  it  all  in  deutsche marks.  If we  came  to  the  conclusion over timethat we would do  all  our  intervention in euros,  we  should becompletely in  euros.  Peter brought  to  the  Committee  the view  that wewill need euros but  that we may also  need some other currenciesbecause parts  of  Europe may decide not  to  join  the common  currency.That  would be a different matter, and we do not know how that willwork out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Peter,  the word  "euthanasia" has been used andI think it  is  appropriate.  One of  the  options you did not  address wasto  dispose  of our DM holdings.  President Jordan may be right  insaying that  this is  not  the  time  to  consider  that  issue,  but we needto  decide at  some point why we  are  still  in  this.  Why do we  stillhold those  large DM reserves?  We have talked about getting  rid ofthem since  I have been here.  We will  have to  get rid of  them before1999.  We do  not know how the  euro  is  going to  come  into play.  We  donot  know if  we will  want  to intervene  in euros.  Why don't  we  takethis  opportunity to  go  to  the Germans  and  say, look,  let's reallyclean our books?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Our  deutsche mark reserves will  not  disappear;they will  be  converted  into euros.  The euro  will be  a major reservecurrency of  the world even  if  it  is  subject to  a great  deal  ofvolatility.  It  is my  forecast  that  there will  be some  volatility,indeed quite  a bit  I would think,  in  the early years  of  the euro.  AndI believe  that  it would be  in  the  interest of  the  U.S. monetaryauthorities  to  have  some capacity to participate  in  reducing what  Ipersonally see as  a rather significant risk of  market disturbances.  Iam not  suggesting any particular  intervention or  any particular  typeof  intervention, but unilateral  disarmament  ahead of  the  event is  notsomething  that  I would be  urging on  the  Committee.  But  I want verymuch  to  separate  these  two  questions,  Governor Lindsey, if  I can.The question of  how these  reserves  are managed and investedand how we  stand as  the  prudent manager of  what  essentially is  apublic  asset  is  different  from  the question  of  the  level.  In my  sixyears  of  association with  this  question, whenever marginalimprovements  in  the prudence with which we manage  these  reserves  arebrought  to  this  table,  the question of  level  is  what  comes  back.  I donot  think the  question of  level  ought  to  dictate  the manner  of  theinvestment.  We  can have  a debate about  the  level--

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  The  reason  is  that  the  interest rate  risk  thatyou  are discussing  is  trivial  in  comparison  to  the  exchange rate  risk,especially  in the  transition  to  the  euro.  That  is  why  it  comes  backto  you.  But  if  we  are  going  to  consider  this  question another  day,  Iam reassured.  Let's  consider  it  another day.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Just  a  follow-up, Peter.  I want  to  make  sure  Iunderstand  the  reason  for your  average  duration proposal.  Did youchoose  the  18-month duration because  that  leaves  you within the  bounds9/24/96-45-of  intervention amounts  that we  have  done  in  the  past?  What  is  thereason for  the  18  months  if  it  does  not  relate to  that?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  If  we just  take  the norm of  historicinterventions,  we  would not  have  to  go  out  to  18  months  in  order forme  to  have a 10-month maturity duration  target.  But  the  day couldcome when the  decision would be made  to  intervene using, say,  half ofour reserves, which would be  three  times  the  largest  interventionamount  used historically.  The Committee has  procedures  for  approvingthe  amounts of  intervention.  I think  this  investment  guidance  I amseeking should be  a separate  issue and not become a constraint  onfuture intervention.  A much shorter duration, whether it  is  15  monthsor  14  months rather  than 18  months,  is  not  the  be-all  end-all.  But  ifyou  start  squeezing and  impose  a shorter  total duration and we wereforced to  intervene  in very  large amounts,  I would run  the  risk ofviolating  the  authorized duration limit  if  I were  to  liquidate  a greatdeal  of  our holdings  at  the  short end.  Let me  just  repeat  that  Ipropose setting a 10-month target,  and  I will not  change that  targetwithout  coming back to  the  Committee and  soliciting your views  on achange.  So,  the  two  things  are  separable  in my mind.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I want  to pursue  an  issue  that EdBoehne brought up.  Peter,  I understood what  you said  about how weaccount  for  this,  but regardless  of  the  accounting, there  is  aneconomic  exposure.  Could you give us  some idea  of  our exposure  rightnow with  the  12-month maturity limit,  given how we  typically investour  currency holdings  under  that  limit,  versus what  the  exposure wouldbe  if we  went  to  a 10-month duration  limit?  What  would be  the  actualincreased economic  exposure  if we  had, for  example,  an upward movementin  German interest  rates  of  100  basis  points?  What  would we  stand tolose  under  this  new scheme  economically, assuming we  had to  liquidateour holdings  right  away, versus  what we  would have  lost based on howwe historically have  invested  our currency  holdings,  at  least  inrecent  times?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We  have  been spelling out  some of  the  risks  inthe quarterly  report  that  we  have been sending you.  The  immediateanswer  that  I have  to  your  question  is what  I referred  to  in  the memo.We  did a simulation  over  an entire  interest  rate  cycle and  looked atwhat would happen if  we were  marking  to  market  the  entire portfolio,including deposits.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Yes,  that  is  the  question  I am  asking.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There was no quarter  in  which a deutsche  markportfolio  structured as  proposed would have  had a net  loss;  that  is,the  capital value  loss  would have been  exceeded by the  earnings.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  The  interest  earnings  offset  the  capital  losses?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  over  the  last  10-year  interest  rate cycle.Moving  15  percent  of  our  holdings  as  proposed  implied a pickup  over anormal  investment cycle  of  about  20  or  so  basis points  over  the  incomeproduced  by our  current  approach  to  investing.  Now,  I do not  haveimmediately in  mind an answer  to  your  question in  the  way youstructured  it.9/24/96-46-

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Peter,  let me  ask you a question to  help  furthermy education.  I took  two  things  out of  the memo.  One,  you want  toswitch  to  an  average duration  limit  as  a way of  measuring the  overallliquidity of  the portfolio.  The  second issue was more  interesting andseemed to  be  the  real question,  i.e.,  whether there was  a case  forincreasing average duration.  You note  that reserves  are  investedwithout price exposure and that  liquidity  is  the  primary objective.That would seem to  suggest a low average duration.  So,  I need tounderstand what you buy by increasing  the duration.  Let me bring  itdown  to  the  story about  the  10-month versus  the 18-month averageduration;  that  was  a good example.  You started by saying you wouldlike  to  have  a 10-month average duration as  the target,  but you wantto have  18  months  as  the  limit  and that  is  in case  of  the  necessityfor significant  intervention.  But  that brings  to  a head the pointbecause you implied  in your discussion that,  of  course, we are  goingto  sell only at  the  short  end.  You did not  actually  say  that, but  theimplication was  that you would sell  from  the  short end of  theportfolio.  So, why are  you holding  long-term securities?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We  tried to  make  clear  several  other points  inthe memo.  First,  I do not  urge  the  Committee to  adopt  the  18-monthduration  limit  solely for  its  liquidity measurement purposes.  I thinkit  is  a replacement  for  the current  12-month maturity ceiling whichwas  intended  to  limit  both price risk and  force a certain amount  ofliquidity into  the portfolio.  It  has  had some perverse effects.  Weare  a major owner of  very illiquid government bonds at  the very shortend of  the  German yield curve.  If  I continue to  try to  get off  theBundesbank's  balance  sheet without  some  increase  in  our duration,  I amgoing  to  be buying more  and more  illiquidity in  these  short-dated  catsand dogs  of  the  German yield curve, which  is  contrary to the  objectiveof  wanting  to be  liquid.  So,  I will be buying  less  and less  liquidpaper.  It  is  less  liquid than  buying securities  "on the  run"  out  ofrecent  auctions  and permitting them  to  decay and having  a sub-portfolio  spread evenly all  along  the  yield curve.  That  is  a bit  ofthe background that  I think changes  the  complexion  of  what you arepointing at.I am  also  doing this  because  I feel  a necessity  to  get  offthe Bundesbank's balance  sheet.  A decade ago  we were  entirelydependent  on  their  balance sheet.  Between 1/4  and  1/2  of  the  reservesof  the  German banking  system were  owned by us  through  the  Bundesbank'sbalance  sheet.  We  are  down  to  a much  smaller proportion  in partbecause we  have moved off  the balance  sheet and  in part because  theBerlin Wall  came  down  and reserves  expanded in  the German  bankingsystem.  That  was  a major  shift.  But  I think we  ought  to  recognizethat  the  Bundesbank  is  in a very different  position  than we  are.  Letme just  turn  it  around.  A couple  of months  ago, when  this  Committeediscussed  the  question of  facilities  for  foreign central banks  on  ourbalance  sheet,  the  Committee members  expressed a great deal  ofreluctance,  skepticism, and concern.  We  are going to  come back  andtry  to  address  these  issues  in  a modified proposal.  We  currentlymaintain tens  of  billions  of  dollars  of  deutsche marks  on  theBundesbank's  balance  sheet with  zero  liquidity  cost.  We  can  liquidatethese  at  zero  notice and contract  their  balance  sheet  at  our whim.9/24/96-47-Now, to put  that  in  context,  the  need here  is  to  get  off  their  balancesheet.  We  have been  rather slow in  doing so,  and  they have beenrather  good natured about  the  tardiness  of  our response  to  theirrequest.  If  I take  that need as  a given, I now have to  look  for aplace  to  invest.  I think a reasonable  first  step  in how I diversifyoff  their balance  sheet  is  to  invest  in  "on the  run" German governmentsecurities  or purchase them at  auction,  and build up a small  sub-portfolio.  So,  it's a different mix  of  factors  than  I think we were--

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I thought  the compelling  story was  the  Germanbalance  sheet, but  some  of  the  same issues  come up  when we  talk aboutthe  liquidity of  the  SOMA portfolio.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  They are  similar.

MR. MEYER.  The difference  is  that  the way you buy differsfrom  the way you  sell,  and  that  is  really my question.  You have  thesame  situation domestically in  that  liquidations  occur at  the  shortend but buying  occurs  over a wide maturity range.  I want  tounderstand what you achieve by buying over  a wider maturity span  thanyou  intend  to  sell.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I'm  sorry;  I meant to  answer your question  thereas well.  I do not mean  to  say  that  I will  automatically  liquidateonly at  the  short  end when there  is  a need  to  liquidate  large  amounts.Indeed, many central banks--the  European central banks--discoveredduring the period of  market  tensions  in  the  early 1990s  that  it  isvery efficient  to  repo  out  long-dated  securities  for  immediateliquidity.  That provides  the  luxury of  selling  those  securities veryslowly and gradually over  time.  That may be  another source  ofliquidity.  We will  try to  develop liquidation  rules  that may have  aneither/or flavor  to  them.  We may liquidate  significantly at  the  shortend or we may repo  out  the  long end and  rebalance  the portfolio moregradually.  That  is  very much my  intention because  of  the enhancedliquidity of  holding the  "on-the-run" German  government  securities.So, your point  is  very well  taken.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  There  is  one  other  factual point  that  it mightbe  useful  to  note,  and I think you referred to  it  in  the memo,  Peter.That  is  that  one  of  the characteristics  of  the German money market  isthat  they do  not have  a lot  of  short  paper.  That reflects  a policyon  the part  of  the  Bundesbank.  They are  changing  this  a little.Therefore,  the other  side of  their  being good natured about  this  isthat  in  some sense  they  themselves  have not promoted the  kinds  ofassets  in  the market  that  we  could easily purchase.  That  is  changinga little  as  I noted,  and the  Desk has  taken advantage of  that.  Again,exactly how it  will  evolve  in  the  context  of  the  euro--leaving asideall  of  the  other  issues  about  the  euro  and  the  amount  of  euros  we willget when  the  transition occurs--is  unclear.  My guess  is  that  onbalance we  will be  better rather  than worse off  because  the  Germansare  the  "least modern,"  if  I may use  that word,  in  terms  of  the kindsof  government paper that  they have  on  the market.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It would be my hope  and  something  of  anexpectation  that  in  the  event  we move  to  euros,  we will  find  a deepershort  end.  And when  it  is  all  denominated  in  one  currency, we may9/24/96-48-find  it  much more  comfortable to  be  invested in  French  governmentbills and  to  have  a shorter duration to  the portfolio.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions  for Peter?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I was  going  to move  approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let's  first  have  the Deputy Secretaryread what  we will  be voting  on.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  This would amend Paragraph 5 of  theAuthorization for  Foreign Currency Operations.  The new wording isfound at  the bottom  of page  1 of Mr. Fisher's  memo dated September  13,and  it would replace  the  first  two sentences  of  the  existing wordingin  the Authorization.  The new wording is  as  follows:  "Foreigncurrency holdings  shall  be  invested to  ensure that  adequate  liquidityis maintained to  meet anticipated needs  and so  that  each  currencyportfolio  shall  generally have  an  average  duration of  no more  than  18months  (calculated as Macaulay duration)."  What  this  new wordingreplaces may be  found in  the  footnote on page  1 of  Mr.  Fisher's memo.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would you  like  to move  it?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I move  approval, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All  in  favor  say  "aye."

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Aye.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No?  The  "ayes" have  it.  The next  item,which is  the  final  item on  the  agenda,  is  a request  from Peter  Fisherfor  the members'  views  on  the  liquidity management  and maturitystructure  of  the  System's  domestic portfolio.  Does anyone have  anyquestions  to  ask Peter  before we move  to  the  specific views  of  themembers?  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I think this  is  where the  issues  come up  that  Istarted to  get  into with respect to  the  investment of  our  foreigncurrency reserves.  It  seems  to  me  that  what you are  talking about  interms  of  the portfolio  is  a compromise between  two  ideas  that  I callbuy-side neutrality and sell-side  liquidity.  I am  struggling to  learnhow you deal with  that.  Buy-side neutrality  says  that you mirroreverything  so  that you  do not have  an  impact on  particular markets.The  sell-side  liquidity  says  that when  you sell,  you  sell  short-termsecurities.  That  is  obviously how you deal with  it.  But  it  seems  tome  that  the  current practice  is  an  attempt  to  deal with  thatcompromise  by segregating  out  a bills portion  that  you sell  and  thenthe  rest  is  for mirroring.  The question is  whether  or not we  could bemore  systematic  in  how we  decide on what  those proportions  should be.It  seems  to be  very  similar  to  the  story we  tell  in  our own regulationwith respect  to  internal  models, market-based  risk,  self  assessment,stress  testing,  and all  the  rest.  The Meulendyke memo  on  liquidityseems  to  be  at  least  an  attempt  to  get  us  to  think  in  that  way.  Butthe  question  it  seems  to  me  is  whether  that  procedure  should be  the9/24/96-49-one  that  determines  the  correct proportion of  bills in  the  totalportfolio, whether  it  is  50/50  or  70/30.  Is  that  the  right  spirit?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  I think it  is.  Let  me make  one  commentbecause  it might  help  other members  to  comment on  it:  I wish I hadmade  this point  clear  in my memo.  In  addition  to  the  two differentkinds  of  neutrality you are pointing to,  there are  two very differentkinds  of  sell-side neutrality.  One  is  a very short-run,  sell-sideneutrality that  relates to  the  impact  on  the market today.  The otheris  a very long-term,  sell-side neutrality that  has  to  do with how thepublic portfolio  is  affected by the  selling.  In  some of  thehypothetical  cases  that  the Meulendyke memo points  to,  if we  were  toliquidate $50  to  $100  billion  and did  it  all  through the  short  end,that would have a rather profound impact on  the public portfolio andthus would not be  sell-side neutral or market  neutral in a long-runsense.  So,  there  is  another balancing going on  there.  I think muchof  the  history of  the portfolio has  reflected  a tension between thesetwo different kinds  of  neutrality.  Obviously,  there  are marketsituations where we would not  want  to  sell across  the  yield curve, butthere might be  some where we would.  Clearly, it  is  generally mostconvenient to  liquidate principally  through the  short  end.  But withthat caveat,  I agree  entirely with your formulation of  the problem.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions?  What Peter  needsto  have  from the members  is  some reaction  to  his  memorandum so  that  hecan move  forward.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think the  case  for moving  toward a somewhatmore  liquid portfolio makes a lot  of  sense.  I don't know whether  itought  to  be  60  percent  bills,  or 2/3  bills,  and the  rest  coupons,  butI think Peter rather  persuasively laid out  the case  that  we need  tomove  in  that  direction.  Perhaps  the way  to  do  it would be  to move  to,say,  a 60/40  split  and see  if  we  like  that.  If we  feel  that  we needto move more  than  that  once we  get  there,  then we could move  further.How  long do you  think  it  would  take  to move  to  a 60/40  splitportfolio?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  While  Sandy Krieger  thinks  about how long thetransition might  take  us,  I would note  that  to  move in  that directionwe probably would need to  have  the Treasury treat us  explicitly as  an"add-on" in  the bill  auctions.  They do not  do that  now because, asdeficits  have come  down, they have  been  contracting their  bill offersand we along with  the  foreign  central banks  have become a rather  largeshare  of  the  competitive auctions.  But  I think that  issue  is  solvableand  that  the  Treasury would amenable,  if  that  is  what we want  to do,to working with us  on  that.  Once we  had their agreement  that we  wouldbe an  add-on--I  am  trying to  think off  the  top of  my head how quicklythe portfolio behaves--I  would guess  that  it  might  take  five years  tomove  our  holdings  of  bills  up  in  a smooth way from  50  percent  to  60percent  of  our  portfolio.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think we  ought  to move  in  that  direction andthen  take  another look at  it.  We might  not wait  five  years but  mightlook toward  getting a progress  report  two  or  three years  from now tojudge  if  the  60  percent makes  sense.  I don't  think  there  is  anabsolutely right  number, but  I think we  know  the  direction  in which weought  to  be moving,  and we  ought  to get  started.9/24/96-50-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In  the  past, we have  discussed thepossibility of  having an  agreement with the Treasury to  swapmaturities with  them in  the event  of  a need on our part  to  liquefy asignificant  amount  of  our  portfolio.  I have  forgotten what  the  answerwas.  Does  anyone recall what  it was?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I do not  recall.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I do not  have a sense  of  a definitive  answerfrom the  Treasury on  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let  me  start from  scratch.  If  we have  amaturity structure problem that would prevent us  from selling  adesired amount of  securities  at  specific  times,  that would make uslean  toward a much more  liquid portfolio.  But what is  there  toprevent  us  from making  an agreement with the  Treasury to  have themswap  two-day bills, or  something like  that,  for  our coupons?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I do  not know of  any constraint  on  that.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  As we  sold the  bills,  it  would make  the averagematurity of  the  debt  in  the hands  of  the public much  shorter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Exactly.  I am only raising  the  issue  ofthe difficulty of  selling  coupon issues  in  the market and as aconsequence  either affecting the  price or  affecting our earnings.  Ifon  the  other hand we made  a straight  swap with  the Treasury,  thatpresumably would not be  an  issue.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That  approach would help  in  terms of  averting theeffect  on prices  in  the market  if  there were  a concern about  sellingcoupons because  there was  a flight  to  liquidity as well  as  to quality.Presumably, the  Treasury would do  it  at  the market value of  thesecurities.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  You  can't  conclude  that there would be no  effecton market prices because  if we  swapped  out  of  coupons  into  short-datedbills  that  are  going to  mature,  the  Treasury would have  to  issue newdebt.  We don't  know what  their marketing strategy would be, so wedon't  know what  the price effect would be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What we  would effectively have  done isto  require  them  to  refinance  fairly quickly.  But depending on  thematurity of  the bills,  even  if  we  made  it  a 20-day maturity, thatwould not really affect  our  ability  to  sell  the bills,  but  it  couldmake  it  easier  for  the Treasury  to  choose an  appropriate  time  frame  torefinance.  If  20  days  is  not good,  45  days  is  not  going to  make muchdifference  for us  either.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  But  without  knowing what  their  overall  deficitfinancing strategy is,  it  would be  hard  for us  to--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  Treasury'sreaction  to  this  would be  110  percent  negative before  they heard theend of  the  sentence.  That  does  not make  it  the  right  answer.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I think this  is  an  issue because  regimes  andideas  at  the  Treasury change periodically.  Like  Ed  Boehne,  I think9/24/96-51-that  increasing  the  liquidity of  our portfolio  is  the  right  thing  todo.  Liquidity  is  not  just a primary portfolio  objective.  It  is  sofar  out  in  front  that  I do  not  even know what  the  second objective is.And going  forward we may not want to  go  to bills  only, but goingdramatically in  that  direction is  the  right  thing to do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  do not care  about  the  earnings aspectand we  should not because it  is merely  a bookkeeping  transfer betweenourselves  and the  Treasury.  I do not know if  there  is  a problem here.There would be  a big problem  if  the  net  issues  of  Treasury debt  to  thepublic were disproportionately in  the  form  of short-term bills becausethat would make  budget policy very closely  affected by  interest ratepolicy.  But  it  has  nothing to  do with us  on  the  other  side.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  why wouldn't  it  if  we  are adding to  ourshort-term portfolio  in an  era  of,  say, low deficits?  Why wouldn'tthat  allow the Treasury  to  ease  off  on  its  issuance  of  long-term debtand move  the whole maturity structure  of  the  debt  toward short  termissues?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  you move  the debt  to  short  term,  itis  the  outstanding debt,  not  the budget deficit,  that  determines theimpact of--

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I would  imagine  that to  accommodate  a growingmoney supply and a move toward  liquidity on  our part  over  time  theTreasury is  going to  have  to  respond  in  an era of  low deficits bylowering the  average maturity of  the debt  structure.  I think that  isthe  incentive we are  creating.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Versus doing what?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  If  the deficit  comes  down and we  are  increasingour take  of  the  short-term debt,  why wouldn't  they have  to respond bymoving  into  supplying more  short-term debt?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Some  20  percent of  the  $6 trillion debt  rollsover  every year and needs  to  be  reset at  the  average  5-year maturityof  the  existing debt.  The  Treasury needs  to  refund over  a trilliondollars of  maturing debt  every year

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Raising  the  issue  of  being able  todo  swaps  with Treasury would add another  item  to  the  list  of  possibleliquidity resources  in  Peter's  paper.  Rather  than working out  a dealthat would  involve  2-day paper, or  perhaps  20-day paper, we probablyshould  instruct  our  Manager,  in  dealing  with Darcy Bradbury'ssuccessor,  to  see  if  an  agreement could be worked  out  that  would be  inthe  best  interest  of  our  customer,  the Treasury, and  in  our bestinterest.  That  would be  one  of  the  things  that  we  could do  as  part  ofdeveloping a panoply  of  liquidity resources.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't  you  talk  to  them over  thereand see  whether  they  slam  the  phone down before  you  can get a coupleof  words  in.  They are more  than  disinclined to  listen  to  anythingthat  complicates their  task  because  they  think they  are  over  their9/24/96-52-heads with work.  If  you  impose any more work on  them, you are not  afriend.  Any  further comments?  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I have  one question  for  Peter.After  looking  at  this,  I  would agree with what  has  been said.  I  thinkliquidity  is  the most  important objective,  and as you said, what weearn on our portfolio does  not  really matter.  It  is  not  like  theforeign portfolio where  there  is  some  tradeoff between  liquidity  andearnings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Those are  real  earnings!

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  That's  right.  The question I have,  Peter,relates  to  the  loans  of  Treasury securities  by the  Desk to  dealers  ingovernment  obligations if  there  is  a delivery squeeze  involvingparticular issues.  If  we  went all  the way and at  some  point got  to  a"bills only" portfolio, would your  inability  then  to  lend securitiescreate any significant problems  for  the  functioning  of  the  governmentsecurities market?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That  is  a good question.  I am somewhatuncomfortable with our current  securities  lending program, to  say theleast.  The program itself  goes  back  to  the period before  governmentsecurities were  in  book entry form.  It  was  designed to  deal with  thetardiness  in  the paper clearing process.  With  the development  of bookentry, I believe  that  the  Desk became eager  to  discontinue  the programand was on  the  verge of  doing so  at  the  time  of  the  Salomon Brothersepisode.  But  that  just  seemed to  be  the wrong time  to make  thechange.  To put  it  bluntly, I am desperate  to  find an occasion todiscontinue  the  securities  lending program, and if  I can  find  theright cover  I will  urge  the  Committee  to discontinue  it.  I do notthink, however, that  this  issue  raises  itself  to  the  issue of  theoverall structure of  the  portfolio.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  But perhaps  on  another  occasion I may come backand  talk  to  the Committee  about some  of  those  more mechanical  issues.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Maybe you can  get  rid  of  it  in  the  context  ofthis portfolio issue.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We  might be  able  to.  I might  add  that even  ifour  coupon portfolio went  down  to  20  percent  or  30  percent or  40percent of  the  total,  we  would still  have  plenty of  securities  tolend,  given the kinds  of  limits  that we  impose.  But  that would not bean  obstacle  to me, and  I do  not  think it  would be viewed as  a seriousmatter  in  the market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  we went  to  bills  only, the  earningsof  the System  would be  highly correlated with  the  federal  funds  rate.Would it  be  assumed  that  as  earnings  go  up we  are  going  to  use  thosefunds  to  go  out  on  the  town or  something  like  that?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Probably.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  I am  sure  someone  would assume  that.9/24/96-53-

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  We  could use  the profits  to  support our"airforce"!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I agree with the  recommendation  of  trying toincrease  the  liquidity of  the  System portfolio.  I am not  sure that  Iknow what the  right percentage  is,  but  I take your point.  I alsoappreciate your efforts,  Peter,  to  try to  identify and analyze theprevious portfolio  objectives.  I take  it  that  what  you plan to  dofollowing  this  discussion is  to  go back and  try  to  come up with  somekind of  statement  of  procedures or policy.  I thought  the principlesthat you noted on page 5 of  your memo were  sound.  They all  seemedimportant  to me, but  they were not  prioritized or weighted.  So,  whenyou go back  to  redo  them,  I think it  would be  helpful  if  you were  toput  them  into  some  kind of  operating context.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Absolutely.  I am  hearing some  encouragement  ofthe  super preeminence  of  liquidity, which will  be  reflected  in  oureffort.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  You do have  it  as  the  first  item  in your  list,but  then  I can't  quite  tell  where  else  it  fits  in.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any other  comments?  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  This  may be  a naive question, but  is  liquidityabsolutely determined by the percentage  of  bills  in  the  Systemportfolio?  A priori,  the more bills,  the more  liquidity?  Are not  theother securities  that  are  commonly used  in  repo  transactions  every bitas  liquid or  is  that  not accurate?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There  is  certainly a good deal  of  depth to  thelong end of  the  yield curve,  but given  the  history and currentstructure  of  the Treasury securities market,  there  is no  doubt  inanyone's mind  that  the  bill  sector  is  much more  liquid.  Now, I thinkthat we have  to  stay in  touch with a possible  evolution at  theTreasury on  this.  Over  a long period of  time  the  relative  liquidityof  bills  could change.  For example,  in  the German yield curve  it  isthe  short end  that  is  illiquid  and  that  I am trying  to  get  out  of.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  That  is  less  liquid, yes.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That  is  not  an  immutable  fact,  but  it  is  a facttoday and has  been a fact  for  the  last  couple  of  decades.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I know the  presumption  is  that  the  bill  area  ismore  liquid;  there  are more  securities  at  that  end,  although  I believethat  the  Treasury has  been extending  the  overall maturity  structure.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  Treasury has  shortened  the  debt  structure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Liquidity through  repos,  or  the  easewith which  one  can  arrange  them,  decreases  in  a crisis  atmosphere.  Itis  precisely  then  that we  may really need a  liquid portfolio.  Thereis  never  a question about,  say,  12-day bills,  whereas  finding  counter-parties  may be  difficult when we  want  to  do  repos  during  a crisis.Everyone  is  then  running  for  cover.9/24/96-54-

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The other point  on  the  liquidity of  bills,President  Minehan, is  that we  could absorb reserves very readily bysimply allowing  them to  run  off  at  maturity.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That was  one reason why the Committee  decided  inthe  mid-1980s  to  shift more  of  the portfolio  toward bills because  thatmeant  that  outright  sales  in  the market would not be  required toaccomplish a large  amount of  reserve  absorption.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I would just note  that we  are  also using thetraders'  definition of  liquidity, which  is  the  ability to  executetransactions  in volume without  moving price.  Clearly, the  long end  isless  liquid in  that  sense.  The  further out  the maturity curve we goand the  more we  are  selling,  the  bigger  the price  effect we will  have.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.  But  I would think  that  if  we  went  to  anall  bills  strategy, we would have complications  associated with howlarge  a share we  are  of  the  auction and perhaps how large  a share weown of  any given  issue.  That might be  a problem as  well.  So,  I thinksome  gradual move  to  a more  liquid position without  going all  the wayis  probably the  one  to  be  preferred.  You asked the  question aboutincome.  I do not  think we  should have  an  income objective  either,  asnobody else  seems  to.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think in  the past  the Committee  has  talked aboutconducting at  least  some  transactions  in the  coupon end of  the marketjust  to be  in  the market  from  time  to  time, and  the possibility ofbuying  coupons  in  certain unusual  circumstances probably should not beruled out.  It  is  something  that  the  Desk has done  in  the  past.  Onlyfour  or  five  years  ago,  the Committee  was  concerned that  the portfoliowas  getting  too  liquid, and  the  Desk was  instructed to  stop moving  itin  that  direction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further comments  or questions?  Peter,do you  think you have  enough  to  move forward?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I will  take a  stab at  the  next  step.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Very good.  The next meeting  isscheduled  for Wednesday,  November  13.  We  have now  concluded thismeeting.
