CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Ijust read on  the  Dow Jones tape  that this meetingwas going to begin  at 9:00  a.m. as  scheduled.  It is now  8:58:25  a.m.  Does anybody  objectto  moving  up this schedule?

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Peter Fisher, would you start us  off?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I will  be referring to  the package  of colorcharts,  which  should be  on the table in front of you.  1/The first page  as  usual shows the 3-month  deposit rates:  current,  3-monthforward,  and 9-month  forward.  Since your last meeting,  there have been small  butnoteworthy changes  in interest rate expectations.  In the United States,  the toppanel in red, you can see  that the 9-month forward 3-month  rate has  slipped belowthe current 3-month  rate.  Even though  this negative  gap is  small--a dozen  basispoints  or so--it is the widest  on  the chart since  the  January period.  I think  itreflects  a growing chorus of voices  in  the market, particularly in  the last  10 days,who are  increasingly confident  that the Committee's  next move will be  an easingaction.In  the middle panel, as you can see, the German  9-month  forward 3-monthrate  also has crept a little lower  in recent weeks.  I think it still reflects theanticipation  of an increase  in European rates  sometime  over the  coming months.  Ibelieve  it is particularly  noteworthy that the 9-month  forward  3-month  rate isactually trading around levels just above  3.8  percent where most people just amonth  ago were  expecting the European  Central Bank's  1-month policy  rate to beset next January.  So,  that reflects quite  a reduction  in expectations  over the lastcouple of months.1/ Copies of the charts used  by Mr. Fisher  are  appended to the transcript.  (See Appendix)8/18/98In the bottom  panel in green,  you can  see that both the  3-  and  9-month  forward3-month rates  in  Japan dropped  distinctly  below the current  3-month  rate followingthe selection  of the new LDP leadership team, but those rates  recently have  bouncedback up a bit.As I  look at  the  last 14  months  of interest rate expectations  in  the leadingindustrial nations,  two things  strike me.  First, the current  trepidation in  globalcapital  markets is not a consequence  of the perception  that the leading central  banksare about to do anything.  There  is no such  expectation.  Secondly,  it strikes me howfar markets  have come  over the last 12  months in giving weight to the  risks ofdeflation,  however  they imagine  them to be.  A year  ago at your August meeting, Iintroduced  my four characters  in pursuit of a  return,  the old and  the new paradigmpessimists  and optimists.  At the time I introduced the new paradigm pessimist  whowas anxious  about  deflation  and global  capacity  glut leading  to competitivedevaluations,  I think only Governor Kelley  had a kind word to say about the newparadigm  pessimist who he  thought should not be overlooked.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  He is  always  nice.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Today,  at least as  the market sees it, the nation with the secondlargest economy  in the  world, Japan,  and the nation  with the largest  share of theworld's potential  labor supply, China, are both experiencing  distinctly falling prices.Moreover, the  premier of China  is no longer worrying  about  maintaining the pace  ofinvestment  in order to  prevent inflationary  bottlenecks.  Instead, he  is now talkingabout how China is trying  to invest its way out of deflation.  It is  this context that Ithink  we should keep  in mind in our effort to understand how the markets  arelooking  at the  question  of whether China  will  devalue its  currency.  I think thatimplicitly this question  is seen,  rightly or wrongly,  as representing  something  of aturning point for the markets--from  a  world they are  familiar with  to one they are lessfamiliar  with, that is, a deflationary  world.Turning to the second page  of charts,  on  the left side are  three panels  showingforeign equity prices,  German  and U.S.  equity prices,  and  German  and U.S.  10- yearyields  over the period  from last July to  the present.  On  the right hand side are threepanels depicting  the same market movements  since  the beginning  of July  this year.on the right hand side first and make  a point.  I think we can  see in retrospect that  thecombination  of the  Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  this July  and Mr.Obuchi's  selection  to lead  the LDP were  turning points for global marketexpectations.  Now,  I want to be  very clear.  In both cases, the outcomes  were  as thebelieve,  in  some wishful  thinking, hoping to be pleasantly  surprised.8/18/98With respect to the  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony,  the market was  hoping thatthe Chairman  would say something rather  kind and benevolent.  Instead, they heardhim say exactly what  he said in  June at his JEC testimony, namely that he  was moreconcerned  about the  risks  of inflation  than those of deflation,  and they heard himtestify with what  might be characterized  as  a "make  no mistake  about it" delivery.With respect to the  selection  of the LDP leadership  and the new Japanesegovernment, again  the market  was hoping to be pleasantly surprised, thinking thatperhaps  the Japanese  could find their own FDR.  So far, it does  not appear  that theyhave.  Thus, looking back, I think the  market's  two self-generated  disappointmentscan be seen as the last sneezes on which  the start of the recent  equity market declinesmight be blamed.I do not have  charts  depicting some of the market movements  in the last twodays that reflect the Russian devaluation.  Let me just note that on Friday both theGerman bund market  and  our Treasury  market experienced  some  extraordinaryinflows.  There is still  a flight  to quality into  both core Europe and the United States.The details  are  still coming out for the Russian devaluation  and debt restructuringannounced  yesterday.  Market assessments  are that the Russian  program  is better, atleast insofar as can be judged in  the  first day or so, than  they might  have feared.However, I think there is  also a  great  deal of anxiety  about how trades  will be settled,and this  is causing considerable  market commotion.  The ruble  was fixed today at 6.8to  the dollar, but it is  trading around 7,  at least  in the  interbank market.  Butaccording to  the reports  that we have, the ruble is  already trading around  9 in theblack market.  I do not pretend to understand, and therefore I am not comfortableexplaining,  how it is that the Dow thinks this is great news  while  the Bolsa and otheremerging  equity markets  think it is bad news.  I think we  will  have to wait a few daysto see how this plays  out.I would note that the devaluation  of the Thai baht had  looked pretty good on day2 also.  I think we have quite a few risks ahead  of us particularly  in the  days aheadwhen  the collateral  that has underpinned  much of the  leverage  in the Russianfinancial  markets starts  to be liquidated  as counterparties figure out what trades  arebeing settled and what trades  are not.  There is  still a great deal of uncertainty  there,but I cannot pretend to be  up to the minute on  these developments.Turning  to the third page, you will see  three  different charts  that depict changesin dollar exchange rates  since July  1997.  In the top panel dollar exchange rates,indexed to last July, are  shown against  a number of currencies  as well as  the Bank ofEngland's  trade-weighted  dollar.  In the middle  panel dollar movements  are shownagainst  the yen and  the mark.  The changes  are comparably  scaled in the middlepanel.  That is, given percentage  changes  for dollar/mark  and dollar/yen  are the sameon the  chart  and permit a comparison  of how  the dollar has moved against the yenvis-a-vis its  movements against  the  mark.  The bottom panel, again comparablyscaled,  shows  the movements of the yen against the mark since  the beginning  of July1997.8/18/98Given  the dollar's movements  indicated  in the top panel, my point, Mr.Chairman,  is that  we are quite fortunate  in  my view  that the  world is  not talkingabout too strong a dollar but rather is focusing  its attention  on too weak a  yen.  Thereare  some  reasons for our good fortune.  Not the  least is the  fact that policy  inertia ismost evident  in Japan  and that the yen is weak  against both the dollar and the mark,as  you can see  in the bottom panels.  The fact  that the yen is weak  against bothcurrencies  has translated  into a remarkably  stable dollar-European  currenciesrelationship  over the last year and a half as evidenced  by the  green  line in the middlepanel  for dollar/mark.  As I noted a moment ago,  investments both  in the last fewdays and over  the last few months have been pouring out of emerging markets  intocore markets.  This  flight to quality is  what has made  our 30-year yields  so low  andhas reduced German  10-year  yields to below 4-1/2 percent.  Because Europeanshistorically have  been  the loudest to complain  about too strong or too weak  a dollar, Ithink the  relative stability  of dollar/mark is obscuring the public's appreciation  of thedollar's strength  against  a lot of other currencies.  For example, we passed  throughnew highs  against the Mexican  peso and  the Canadian  dollar.Another way to think about the strength of the dollar  is to look at how stable thedollar/mark  relationship has been  and to realize  that  we are in the middle of theperiod in which,  as I  would have expected  and we hear anecdotally,  there aresignificant flows into Europe in anticipation  of the creation  of the euro.  Those flowsare not going  to occur in January  after the euro is a fact, but people are trying toposition themselves  in  anticipation of its creation.  Again,  with bund yields  at 41/2percent,  we see that the bund seems to be the happy place to invest in  anticipation ofa  successful launch  of the euro  and  also to hedge  against its failure.Turning to the fourth  page of charts,  you can see in  the  top panel  the SeptemberEurodollar futures contract  as it has traded from May to the present  and thesee the slight decline in yields  in the last few  days as expectations  of an  ease inpolicy, not immediately  but in the  future, have  come into the market.  What I think ismuch more  noticeable in the top panel is  how flat and boring  these movements  havebecome  since your July meeting  compared  with what they were earlier in the  spring.There is much  less  a sense of  "push  me/pull  you"  in the interest rate markets  andexpectations  have gone very flat without  a lot of rate  movement.The bottom two panels  show  something that I  depicted several meetings  ago,which is the  positive  carry of on-the-run  Treasury  issues.  The on-the-run  Treasuryyields are  shown  in the red dots  and the blue dots  represent the term-to-datefinancing  for each  of the on-the-run issues.  The gap  between the two  gives somesense of the positive carry  that the dealer community and leverage  participants  arestill experiencing  in pricing on-the-run  Treasury  issues.  I want to make  clear that thegeneral collateral  rate that  applies to most Treasury  securities  is still close to thefunds rate,  and therefore  there is not as much  positive carry for most off-the-run8/18/98issues.  However,  the price discovery  process is dictated  by the  on-the-run  issueswhere there is depth,  liquidity, and trading  volume.  Even  as the yield curve hasbeen  squeezed  to below the  funds  rate, you still can  see the very modest  positivecarry  in the on the-run  issues.Turning to  open market  operations  on the next page,  activity in the federal  fundselevated rates  on one day when  wire  transfer problems  bottled up a very largeamount of funds  at  a major money center bank.  That bank  sold funds  in the  marketafter the wire was  extended. Given  the very firm rates  we saw  around the turn frommore or less in calming  the market in this case.  Yesterday,  we had quite an elevatedfunds rate, which is not  depicted  in this  chart.  August  14,  the last date shown in thechart,  was on Friday, and the  somewhat higher range  of trading on that day occurredin anticipation  of market pressures  associated  with the  settlement of the Treasury'srefunding yesterday.  There  was in fact a great deal  of pressure  in the marketyesterday,  but that seems  to be behind  us.  We made  an outright purchase  of $1billion of securities  on August 3,  and we will  be looking for opportunities  to  makeadditional  permanent injections  of reserves  in the coming days.One final point, Mr. Chairman:  On the last page  of my handout  is a list ofprimary  dealers.  A number of Committee  members  and others in the  System haveasked me  how  many dealers  there are.  You  need a  scorecard  to know  the players  atpresent.  In the top  half of the page,  you can  see the 26 dealers  whose  status  has notchanged in the  last year.  On  the left side  of the bottom half of the page, you can seethe list of dealers  27 through  39  as of August  1997.  At the bottom, you  can  see  thethree withdrawals  that have occurred since  then:  Yamaichi, Eastbridge,  and Sanwa.Sanwa was  the  most recent firm to withdraw  from dealer status.  They  were  awarethat we thought  of them as one  of our weaker  counterparties,  but their decision  toclose  their operations  was  unlike that of Yamaichi  and Eastbridge:  It was not forcedon them by the market or other events but reflected a  business judgment on their part.A  dealer operation  was  not in  the mix  of activities  that they thought  would beprofitable  for them in  New  York.In the middle column for August  1998,  we have listed the mergers  that havebeen effected  to date.  On the right side,  you can  see that we expect  a couple moremergers to take place and  have two  pending applications  for dealer status.  I  want tomake clear that we do not have the  "aspiring dealer"  category,  but it  still takes  sometime to  work things out  with a firm that  has approached  us to become a  dealer.Mr. Chairman,  we did not  conduct  any foreign  exchange  intervention  operationsduring the  intermeeting  period.  I will  need  the Committee's ratification  of theDesk's domestic open  market operations,  and I will be happy to answer anyquestions.8/18/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The black market  ruble is  selling at 9 and the fix  was around7.  What  are the mechanics  that allow that  to  happen,  and secondly,  which  of the  two rates filters  intothe price  inflation  structure?  In other words,  which rate  affects  import pricing?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The right answer is that I do not know.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is  the wrong answer!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It is the  only correct  answer that I am able to give.  I think the mostimportant point is  to be  very skeptical  about the interbank  fixing at 6.8  or 7 rubles  to the dollar.  It isbest to assume  that that  is a number that someone  in  the central bank  or a couple  of banks have

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is there a  measure of volume  in  the black market?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  By definition,  we don't know how to measure  that.  We  don't even  knowwhether the black  market is experiencing  a deep day  or a thin day.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Some black markets  are blacker than others.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Yes.  I'm afraid I cannot  help you there, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  I don't know either, but my guess would be that the  fixing rate is  arate at which  people have  agreed ex ante  to settle certain contracts.  Ultimately,  it should providesome guidance,  but it doesn't necessarily provide  any in the  short run.  The black market ratepresumably  depends  a bit on where  you are and who you are  and which black market you aretalking about--the foreign  exchange kiosks  outside the railway  station or the  large transactions. Ithink there is  a big difference  between those.  Over time, we  could see  a black market in  Russiathat was very important  in terms of its  effects on import pricing and the inflation  structure or onethat  was of only minor significance  because it would be the place  where  one  might go to  take8/18/98$100,  not $100  million, out  of the country.  The Russians  have essentially  brought their foreignexchange  and financial markets  to a halt.  In  time, as  they announce  what  they are  doing with theGKOs  and  what they are doing  with the 90-day  suspension of debt repayments,  one would  thinkthat  these things  will come together.  For a  while,  though, I  would assume  there will  be a  numberof different rates  depending on the nature of the underlying  transactions.  I guess that's as  far as Iwould go, which is  more words  but less  substance  probably than Peter Fisher conveyed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  This is an easy question.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Good!

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  What exactly did the Russians  do?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That is not an easy question!

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  They floated their exchange  rate.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  To a band?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  They had a band before, but they were  really operating  with a heavilyguided, narrow  interbank band.  However, they floated the ruble in a wide enough band that  it istrading,  at least for the moment, within that band; it is not yet  at the lower  limit.  They announcedthat they were going to restructure their  internal official  debt in the  form  of the GKOs,  which areobligations  with maturities  of less than  one year, and  their OFZs, their more than  1-yearobligations.  They announced  a debt moratorium  or suspension  of controlled payments, and  theyclarified that announcement  slightly this morning to say what was  included  and what was not.They excluded  debt to the EBRD, state  and local  debt, and some other categories.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  So  they excluded foreign  official types of debt?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They have  excluded  foreign  official obligations.8/18/98

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  What about  private-sector  debt?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Private-sector  debt is subject to a form  of temporary  capital control.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Just the  external  private-sector  debt--debt to  foreign  lenders  asopposed  to  debt within the country?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes,  debt owed to foreign  lenders.  The trouble  is that the linkages  arequite  high.  It is a little  odd to read in the wires that Russian banks  have  borrowed abroad  in  orderto invest in  GKOs,  which  are obligations  denominated  in rubles.  That is not exactly what  onenormally would  think would be the way so-called  financial  institutions  should operate.  That hasled  to a  lot of problems and, of course,  there has been  a lot of financial  engineering  going  onrelating  to those  transactions.  That has created  a lawyers'  paradise.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes,  with no  laws.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  lots of laws,  maybe no justice!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Just a small  follow-up  question, which  may  be harder.  Why?  Werethey really broke?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think the answer to that question  is "yes."  They had lost about $5billion  in reserves,  most of it in  the last couple of weeks since  their program was put in place.  Itwas  quite clear that  the new program  approved by the IMF on July 20 had  not stabilizedconfidence.  They were facing  an external  and  internal  financial  crisis.  The  only difference  is  thatthey did  it with  $10  billion of actual  foreign  exchange  reserves  still in the bank rather than zero.One might argue that it is better  to take  such  actions  sooner rather than later.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  So,  you  think they really  did have  the $10  billion?8/18/98

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes.  Their dwindling reserves  combined  with the momentum  in  theregrettable,  as has been  amply highlighted.  Abandoning  the peg means, at  least for the moment,that they put in jeopardy the one  success they have  had on domestic  inflation.  With regard to whatmight be  viewed  as  their internal defaults,  I think that will be mostly a matter  of restructuring  andrefinancing their internal  debts, though  that process  gives rise to some  trepidation.  It is hoped thatthere  will not be a confiscatory refinancing  in real terms,  and in that sense one might argue  thatthey will just be leveling  the playing  field that is particularly oriented  toward the domestic  fiscalproblem.  Even making relatively modest assumptions about how much they have achieved  on thefiscal  side, they have  a primary  surplus.  Their problem relates  to the fact that they haveaccumulated  a lot of debt recently, and they have very high  interest rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Peter, at the beginning of your remarks  you made reference  to marketconcerns  about Japan in  two ways,  deflation  and weakness  of the yen.  This may sound like  acontinuation  of a  similar discussion about Japan  at the last meeting  or some of the  previousmeetings.  What  adjustment process do  people really  think needs  to take place  in Japan?  Whennumerous examples  in the last couple of decades  of governments,  central  banks,  and regimes  ofone type or another--in  the former Soviet Union, Latin America,  and elsewhere--that  havedismantled various barriers  to  the free  flow  of goods  such as tariff and non tariff barriers,  themovement  of products  if not labor, and obstacles  to financial  flows such as  capital and othercontrols.  We have  seen as  a  result that  the law of one price takes  over and the economies  inquestion  move toward equilibrium  in  global markets--those  for goods  as well  as  assets.  If we start8/18/98from where Japan was  some  years back and if--maybe  a big "if'--Japan  is in  the process  ofgradually transforming  itself into  something that is more  like a  market economy, they  will  have  tohave either deflation  or devaluation.  They cannot  get from  current  domestic yen prices to  worldhave  deflation and  does not want them to  devalue  their currency.  What do they want them to  do,impose  controls?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't think the world or market participants  disagree with  youranalysis.  I believe  the dominant  view  is that the yen will  grind lower from its current level.  Thatis the market consensus  forecast  for exactly the reasons  you described.  Now, the  market hasgotten itself into a bit of a loop by becoming persuaded that a depreciating  yen  will  force thedevaluation  of the Chinese  yuan.  I  don't think that follows  from a macroeconomic  perspective.  Itis the  absence of Japanese demand  that is  affecting  the rest of Asia, not the behavior of the yen perse, even if that makes  things worse.  But there is a deeply  imbedded expectation in the market thatfurther  yen  weakness  will  lead to a  devaluation  of the  yuan  and the Hong Kong dollar.  That iswhere  the market  gets itself into a tizzy and  thinks that such  an outcome will  be the end of theworld as  they know it.  I am  impressed  by the number of unabashed  dollar bulls I talk to who  saythat if the  Japanese do the right  things, if they suddenly find their FDR  and start to clean  up theirbanking  sector, the yen  will continue  to  weaken.  But if they  don't get their  act together and theycontinue to  dawdle and delay, the  yen is  still going to weaken.  The result would be positive  forthe dollar in either case.  The  dollar bulls  are unabashed  in  asserting that view,  essentially  alongthe lines  that you outlined.  It is the Chinese  connection that I think causes the anxiety.8/18/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  What about  the  differential  between  tradable  goodsprices in Japan  and  the average  general  price  level,  which  is really  a crucial  difference  thererelative to  the rest of the  world?  What  do the markets think about that  resolution?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  How  is it going to be  resolved?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  In other words, how do the traders  view a  continuingweakening  in the yen  and Japan's ever increasing  trade surplus?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think they recognize  a certain  tension there.  That is true even  of thosewho assert that the best probabilistic  forecast of dollar/yen  is that it will  go through  150 and keepgoing.  If we  ask the  same  people who make that forecast  when they plan to start to "bottom fish"and buy cheap Japanese  assets, the quick response is that  the time to start cost-averaging  in isnow.  They do not see any contradiction  there.  I think that is the traders'  answer to your question.They  are in effect  acknowledging  that the turn may occur sooner than they are  forecasting,  whichitself is ironic.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  If their position does not appear altogetherlogical,  it is not.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  appreciate that, Vice  Chair.  [Laughter]  PresidentHoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Peter, I think you just answered this question, but given  the confusionin the market, I will  ask it again.  When  you made your earlier comments,  you indicated that theHow is that reflecting  itself in the market?  In other words,  how is this new  attention  to deflationmanifesting itself in  the market's  actions?8/18/98

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  One thing I alluded to  is the continuing  demand  for bunds  andTreasuries,  which is indicative  of uncertainty.  The reason  for the uncertainty  is that investors  donot understand  the deflationary  world,  and the result is  a flight of capital.  The  flight is  notmotivated so much  by a search  for quality as it is for certainty, to something  investors think theyknow how to price.  As I have  said a  few times  before,  18  months  ago  I could  not find anyone  inGermany who thought Germans  would hold  10-year bunds  at a yield  under 6 percent.  They sawthat rate  as  a rigid floor.  Now the yield is below  41/2 percent.  Something  affecting  global investorsentiment  has changed.  That is  how I would put it.  Now,  that is not an entire explanation,  but it'sthe best that I have.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Better than mine!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  How do you read the rise  in risk spreads in the last  threeor four months--junk bonds  vis-a-vis Treasuries,  BAA's versus  single A's, that  sort of spread?They are not huge by any means, but they sure are  consistently higher.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I may be  too much of an optimist here, but I think there is a  growingappreciation  that credit  quality  may matter  some day.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is  also a  deflationary  indicator.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Absolutely.  In  a deflationary world,  lenders and investors  had betterstart figuring out who is  going to remain  in business because not  everyone is  going to make it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further questions  for Peter?  If not,  would somebodymove  approval  of the Desk's  operations?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move approval  of the domestic  operations,  Mr.Chairman.8/18/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  We now turn to Messrs.Prell  and Truman.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Let me start with  a few  words  about the  June trade  datathat were released  this morning.  The deficit  was $14.2  billion  compared with adownward  revised  $15.5  billion  in May.  As readers of the footnotes  in theGreenbook  know, we put  down an estimate  for the June deficit  that wassomewhat  larger  than the one that was implicit in BEA's preliminary estimate  ofsecond-quarter GDP.  We had weaker  exports of goods  and services, strongerimports,  and a deficit of $16  billion.  That deficit  was similar to one of theconsensus  market reports  and a bit higher than another, though both  were  abovethe BEA estimate.  In fact, exports declined further in June by  about themagnitude  that BEA  assumed but by less than  we had estimated.  The decline inimports  was more than  BEA assumed  and substantially more  than we estimated,suggesting perhaps a  bit less  strength in underlying domestic  demand than  wemight have thought.  Despite this positive surprise,  the effects of the Asian crisison  our trade  balance are not over.  Our bilateral  trade deficits with the Asianeconomies,  including Japan,  widened  further in  the  second quarter.  Moreover,we had a decline  in real  exports of goods and services  for a rare second quarterin a row.  The differences  between  the staff and BEA estimates  for real netexports in Q2 from the now-published  data merely  reduce  the deterioration  fromalmost $60 billion--measured  in chained  1992  dollars--to  slightly less than $50billion at  an  annual rate.  Our quick look at these  data suggests  that, taken  alone,they would  imply an  upward revision of about  half a percentage  point tosecond-quarter  growth.  However, there is likely to be a substantial  offset inproducers'  durable  equipment.To  state the obvious,  the June trade  data do not alter the  contour of ouroutlook for the external  sector from the  one we have  presented for the last  sevenmeetings:  continuing restraint on  aggregate  demand  in the United Statesassociated with  very weak growth  on  average  abroad  and a strong  dollar.  But wesee  some  diminution in these trends.  Though it is difficult to imagine at times,growth  abroad will  eventually  return to trend.  In our outlook,  growth picks upnext  year, but it remains extraordinarily  weak.  We believe  that the  modestpickup  in foreign  growth on average--with  perhaps  some associated modestuptick in  interest rates  abroad--the  success  of the euro's introduction,  thestabilization  of the Asian crisis, including importantly  the situation  in Japan,  andthe widening  U.S.  current account  deficit will  be enough  to bring about someAs I am sure  you can appreciate  and as was  amply demonstrated  in PeterFisher's  report and by the discussion  that followed it, we once again  had toassemble  a forecast  against  the background  of substantial  turbulence  in  globalfinancial markets that  has  been associated  with considerable  uncertainty  about8/18/98the course of policies  and other developments in  much of the rest  of the world.While most of the major industrial countries  seem to be on  solid growth paths,Japan is a glaring exception.  In fact,  one might argue that the uncertainty  aboutits prospects  are indicative  of the risks  in the  entire external  forecast.So,  let me  say a few  words about our outlook for Japan while  staying awayfrom the deflation  debate.  I proceed from the assumption  that Japan's downwardspiral eventually  will come to an end.  We  have a bottom built into the forecastbut not much  of a recovery.  Four consecutive quarters  of negative growth  areprojected to end this quarter.  For the remainder of the forecast  period, Japanesegrowth  averages  less  than one percent at an annual rate.  While  net exportsimpart a  small positive  contribution to Japanese growth throughout  the forecastperiod, that growth  is driven almost entirely by government  spending.  We havea  swing in the structural budget deficit of 3/4 percentage point this year and a bitmore  than 1 percentage  point next year, including a large dose of permanentpersonal  and corporate tax  cuts and some additional  spending that is not yet onthe plate of the Diet.  However,  private domestic  demand contracts  through  themiddle of next year and is flat thereafter, even  with substantial  tax  cuts.  Thus,we have  at best the hint of a turnaround in Japan based  on the assumption thatthe Japanese  authorities will  continue gradually  to get their collective  acttogether on fixing  the banking system  and the macro  economy.For the developing countries  in Asia, we have five quarters  of negativegrowth extending  into  early  1999 and a modest recovery thereafter.  Our basicstory is that external  and internal  financial  conditions  stabilize, recovery beginsin the  traded  goods sector, confidence  improves,  and investment begins to pullout  of its deep swoon,  financed primarily  from internal  sources  of funds--not  bydomestic  banks.Outside  of Asia, we  have weakness  in Latin  America owing to thespillovers from Asia that add to investor caution and boost interest rates.  Withslowing  growth in Canada  and the United Kingdom because  of the rise in realinterest rates in both countries,  there is not enough  growth in Euroland toprovide much  impetus to aggregate  foreign growth.Weighted  by U.S.  nonagricultural  exports, the four-quarter growth  offoreign  GDP  was less  than 2 percent in the  second quarter of this year and willhave  remained below that rate for six consecutive  quarters  ending in the thirdquarter of next year.  The only comparable period  over the  past thirty years wasin  1982-83.  By this metric,  the  Asian crisis  and its surrounding events  andaftermath  are now  projected to match the scale of the Latin  American  crisis inthe early  1980s.  To review a bit of history, in that case the  dollar continued torise through  early  1985--albeit  with a different U.S. fiscal-monetary  mix--andour current  account deficit peaked at 3.6  percent of GDP in 1987,  the  year inwhich our net international  investment position  turned negative.  In  contrast,  we8/18/98project that the  current account  deficit as  a share of GDP will  exceed theprevious  peak by early next year and that our net international  investmentposition will  be an estimated  minus  20 percent of GDP.There are  still considerable  downside  risks to the  outlook, as illustrated  bythe material  on  the possible implications  of recent Russian  events  that wascirculated  to the Committee  late yesterday  by Peter Hooper.  At the same time,there are  some upside risks  as well.  Without spelling them  all out, let me justsay that at some point our outlook for the external  sector will be  seen inhindsight to  have been too pessimistic.Nevertheless,  I suspect that the next cycle  of external  excitement  will focuson our external position  and the dollar.  The reason is that unless growth in therest of the  world comes  roaring  back, we are likely to  see a continuing erosion  ofour external  position  from what is already a rather low  base,  and investors willsee dollar depreciation  as the  only way to narrow the gap.  Moreover, we don'tknow how  much of the recent  strength of the dollar has been  driven bysafe-haven  or risk-aversion  considerations.  It is  suggestive, I think, that thedollar did not rise  against either the DM or the yen  yesterday  following theRussian  announcements.  Once Japan  and the rest  of Asia stabilize,  the air couldcome out of the  dollar's balloon  in a rush, and I could find  myself in  anotherlocation  drafting vacuous  statements about the excessive  and unjustifiedweakness  in the  dollar.Mike Prell will now  add his own perspective  on the  outlook.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Frankly,  I'm hard pressed  to see  where I can  add much  ofvalue to what you already  have  heard this morning  or read in the  Greenbook.Much  of the drama during the intermeeting  period  was on the international  side,which Ted has just covered.  The domestic development  that has attracted  themost attention,  the decline  of the stock market, has  been pretty much of thedimension  we predicted  last time and for the reason  we gave--namely,disappointing corporate  earnings.Looking ahead,  our forecast has been  altered only a little, mainly  toincorporate  the more  negative  outlook for the external  sector and to deal  with theadditional  short-run  gyrations  associated  with the longer-than-anticipated  GMstrike.  The basic  story, however, remains  one of a deceleration  in economicactivity and some worsening  of inflation.Perhaps  the interesting point is  that  we appear to be predicting aconsiderably weaker  expansion  of aggregate  demand  than are  the majority offorecasters.  For example, the latest Blue Chip consensus  shows nominal  GDPgrowing  around 4-1/4 percent  over the six  quarters  of our projection period--the8/18/98better part of a percentage point above  the Greenbook  prediction--even  thoughtheir short-term  interest rates are,  like ours,  flat.I can't tell you  for sure  why our forecast  differs  from the average  view ofthe  several  dozen Blue Chippers, but the  available  detail  on their forecastscontains one compelling  clue:  Only two members  of the Blue  Chip panel havereal net exports in  1999  as low as the Greenbook  forecast,  and the consensusview  is that the  trade  gap will  widen  only around $25  billion  over the next sixquarters, versus more than  $100  billion in  our forecast.  Even  allowing for theendogeneities  that President Poole emphasized at  a prior meeting, I feel quitecomfortable in  asserting that this difference  is a key factor in our more  subduedoutlook.  While I can't prove who  is right on this, I will note--because  humilitywould prevent Ted from doing so--that in  the past couple  of years  he and hiscolleagues  have been  much more on track than  the private  analysts  with regard tothe  deterioration  in  our trade position.Of course, even  if we  don't seem to be  at odds  with the Blue Chip panelwith respect  to the  tenor of the domestic  demand  outlook, that doesn't meanwe're right on that side.  Expectations of a  slackening of demand  have repeatedlybeen  disappointed in  the past couple of years,  and there is no assurance  that itwill materialize this  time.  We continue  to think that the performance  of thestock market has been,  and  will be, a key factor.  The revisions to the  nationalincome accounts  have done  nothing to diminish  our belief in the significance  ofthe "wealth  effect."  Although the recent slide in  equity prices has erased  only amodest portion of the gains that had accrued to investors, the  mere cessation  ofwealth increases  relative  to income  would  remove an impetus  to householddemand.  And this, in turn,  would prompt businesses to curtail  the growth  oftheir inventories  and fixed capital.This is, of course, the scenario  that we have  described in our forecast.  Wehave the  Wilshire  5000 running at a level around  10,000 through next year;  itclosed less than one percent  above that level yesterday  after exceeding  11,000 afew  weeks  ago.  As  we noted in the Greenbook,  even with that correction,  sharesstill  seem  to be  very generously valued,  given what we see as  the plausible  scopefor corporate  earnings  growth from the high levels already  attained.  But, whilesome hints of rationality  perhaps have  crept into the market,  one still  hearspeople  saying that there  is no  other good place to put investible funds.  A surereturn  of 5  or 6  percent  on  a fixed-income investment  doesn't provide muchcompetition  for equities  that, as  surveys have  repeatedly  shown,  people expect toyield double-digit  returns  over the coming  years.  To be sure,  there were signs ofsome hesitation  in flows into equity funds  during the  recent market downdraft,but we've  seen  such episodes  before in  this long bull market.  It seemingly  takesmerely a  whiff of favorable-news  oxygen to get the bulls running again.  In fact,yesterday they even  rallied the market  on what might have been  construed  as bad8/18/98news.  Under the circumstances,  we've thought  it wiser for now to treat  a deeperLet me  turn, then, to the inflation side of the  ledger.  Given our softer realoutlook, it probably  isn't surprising  that we also have  a more  moderate  inflationforecast than  the Blue Chip.  Again,  without knowing their perspective  aboutsuch things  as the dollar, oil  prices, and crop prospects,  it's difficult to  pinpointthe sources  of the difference  in forecasts.  I think we've given  due emphasis  inthe Greenbook  and in yesterday's  Board briefing to the uncertainties  that  attendthe price  outlook.  The  trimming of our core  inflation forecast since  the lastmeeting represents  in large measure  a fairly straightforward  reaction  to theslightly weaker  outlook for aggregate  demand and the lower import  prices thatnow  appear likely.  But, at the margin, we've also been moved by some of therecent economic  data to give a little more  weight to the  stories we've been tellingall  along for why inflation should be  slow to pick up even with  such tight laborrecently than  we had predicted.  Given that the  July CPI was to be released thismorning, just before my briefing, moving  our forecast farther below  theconsensus  obviously  was  risking some immediate embarrassment.  But the Fateshave been kind, with the two-tenths  increases in  the overall  and core  indexesbeing in  line with our expectations.The bottom line  of the inflation story is  that, although  labor markets  are tight,experience  suggests that  prices respond only slowly to such pressures.  And, in therecent period,  and for a  while longer, the underlying  tendency for inflation to pickup  in response  to those pressures  is being  offset by favorable  shocks  with respect  tothe  terms of trade  and supplies of food and energy--not to mention an  ampleamount of unutilized factory capacity.  Some of the  favorable shocks  are  expectedto turn around next year but not with sufficient  force to do  much  damage  withinour projection period.  We'll be extending our Greenbook  forecast through 2000next month, and I hesitate  to venture now  beyond  our current horizon.  However,recognizing  that  the lags in the effects  of policy on  inflation are long, I probablyshould offer the observation  that, with  a stable funds rate, there's nothing in thedirection  of our present  forecast that points  to a take-off in wages and prices  in2000.  Of course,  with things  as unsettled in some important  areas as they are now,we'll have to take a further close  look at this over the  coming weeks.  Thatconcludes  my prepared remarks,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With regard to  the year 2000 problem, I noticed  that theGreenbook  forecast does  not have  any acceleration  in nonfarm inventory  investment  for the  fourthquarter of 1999.  I have no doubt that as  we move  toward an unknown Y2K phenomenon,just-in-time inventories  will get a little disrupted  and concerns  are going to arise that will create8/18/98some inclination  to put a few extra goods  on the shelves,  so to  speak.  Has  anyone  thought aboutthat  as a potential cyclical  event?  My question is whether  the numbers that are  involved are  sosmall  that they are not even remotely  of an order of magnitude  to show up in forecasts  such  asthese.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We have not  anticipated that prospect in our forecast,  as our numbersmight suggest.  The one thing that we  have anticipated is a pattern  of earlier than usualacquisitions  and installations  of computer equipment over the  next few  quarters in an effort  toavoid doing a lot of that in late  1999.  But I take your point; what  you describe  is possible.Certainly a lot of people may consider stockpiling  some cash over that  weekend.  That is anentirely different issue.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  That inventory will be up!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Obviously, we  will  have to  confront this question  more  concretely whenwe  write down  year 2000 numbers  in  our Greenbook forecast  for the next meeting.  We will dothat with some trepidation. I don't recall hearing  anything from business firms that suggests theyhave  focused  very much  attention  on this matter thus far.  In fact, even  in talking to  some of thecomputer firms,  we find that they  sometimes seem  surprised when  we raise  the question  aboutbusiness  strategies  with respect to equipment  purchases  toward the end of next year.  It is a bitpuzzling that people seemingly  have not given more  attention to that question, but there is, I think,plenty of time for them  to undertake  that kind of stockpiling.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me put it this way.  The one forecast that I will  makeunequivocally--with  almost the  same amount  of fervor as  Governor Kelley  displayed  in his forecastof currency inventories--is  the media's response to this.  From their perspective this  is theequivalent of an asteroid  hitting the earth  at 12:01  a.m on January  1, 2000.  The one thing  we can8/18/98be certain  about is  the extent to which  this Y2K issue  will be unbelievable  grist for the media.Two  days before  the  start of the year  2000, that is  all that is going  to be in the newspapers.  Twomonths before,  there  will  be enough  of it to really attract  people's  attention  because  there is  no waythat anyone can  guarantee  that the  event has a zero probability  of being  disruptive.  So, it  will geteverybody's  attention  and it is going to affect  business  behavior.  People  make decisions  in thecontext  of relative degrees  of certainty, and this will  be a major uncertainty  without historicprecedents.  No one has  a clue about what will happen  under these conditions.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Obviously, firms that provide  goods  that their customers  might want toadd to stocks  will have to decide  whether to increase  production  or just let  their shelves be depletedand then not have  to reverse  an increase  in production.  With  the just-in-time production  chains,there may have to be some producer responses.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  What  happens  is that business  firms that fail  to meet thedemand of their customers  lose market  share.  Customers  are  going to build inventories,  and theonly question is to what  extent.  If company A does  not supply  a product, company  B will.  This isgoing to be  a  very interesting  forecasting  exercise.  You did say that you're  going to extend yourforecast  to include  the year 2000 in the Greenbook  for the next  meeting?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We're looking  forward  to it!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I have two questions.  Ted, when  I went  to Asia in Juneone of the comments  that I  heard, particularly in  Korea, was  that  a lot of exporters  were facingtremendous  difficulties in getting financing  to support  their businesses.  More  recently,  there  havebeen discussions  about a shortage of shipping containers  and the need  actually to build them inAsia.  The reason I  guess is that most of the containers  are  in the United States  at this point.  Do8/18/98you think these  developments  are major factors affecting Asian exports to  the United States?  Ifthese two problems  were to be  dealt with, would that  lead to  a significant increase in our importsfrom Asia?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I would  say a couple of things.  I think your sign is probably right.  Ibelieve the problems  are still  there;  we  still hear  these reports.  The question  is one of magnitude.It  is fair to  say that our imports  have not increased as much  as  one might have  thought as  a resultof this crisis.  But we  have to be  a little careful  about that conclusion because  those imports haveheld up in nominal terms and their prices clearly  are down.  So, in real  terms there  has been  anincrease in imports from Asia, though  perhaps  not as  much  as certain  incentives  would suggestthere could have been.  Therefore,  it would seem to me that  in time, one way or another, if theincentive  is  there and remains,  people will  find a way  around the obstacles and there will  besome upward impact on  our imports.  On the other hand,  to the extent that the  growth of the U.S.quite interesting  that the one  area where  we  seem to  have been  about right in our forecasts is theextent  to which  the  swing in the trade  position  of the developing  Asian  countries has been  sharedamong importing  countries.  Some considerable  fraction  has  gone to Japan,  notwithstanding itsown situation,  and a considerable  fraction  to Europe  as  well.  Indeed, in  line with somecomments at recent meetings,  European domestic demand  has  been much stronger than weexpected before  the crisis,  and European  net exports have been  much  weaker.  Thus,  there  hasbeen  a parallelism  in this situation.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Thank you.  Mike, I thought the  staff survey  on recent trends  incompensation  practices  produced  some interesting results, as did the  related discussion of theECI.  One thing that struck me  is that variable compensation  practices clearly  have become much8/18/98more significant  for many firms  in  different  industries.  In  the past, at least  when we  had aneconomic  slowdown,  sticky wages  were  an important automatic  stabilizer.  Have  you done anyanalysis that  can give us some  insight into how the  more flexible  compensation  practices  will  infact affect total compensation  when  the U.S.  economy goes  into a slowdown  and what the effectson spending might be?  I ask because  it appears  that we will be facing a different situation  fromwhat we  have experienced  in the past.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  are engaged  in  a multifaceted  research  effort on that issue.  In a  sense,the  work that the Reserve  Banks were  kind enough to do for us in conducting the  survey is a smallcomponent of that research.  We  have been talking to firms, interviewing  them in some depth,  andwe are  going  to be doing more of that.  Our contacts  emphasize  that this  is a new  laborcompensation  regime and  that flexible  compensation  practices  will  enable  them to cut back  onlabor costs if the economy  and their fortunes  deteriorate.  That outcome  is untested  and time willtell.  We also  are doing some  statistical work  at a micro level,  using employment  cost index  datafrom the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, to try to  estimate  at the firm level how businesses aremanaging  in this new regime,  perhaps  by trading off various components  of their compensationpackages  and so on.  We hope to have some  additional  insights on this in the  next several  months,but I think this is  something that ultimately will have  to be tested in the real world by a real  changein the cyclical  situation.  We will  only be in the conjecture phase on  this for now, but I think thattoo is a potentially meaningful  exercise.I would stress that  our projection  of the  ECI does not assume  a major change  incompensation  behavior.  Some of these  compensation  elements do not even  show up in the ECI.That is  another factor we need to take  into account  in thinking  about cost pressures in the economyand how those may wax or wane.  Basically, the most important element  going forward is the8/18/98potential  role of the  continuing  low inflation that  we are experiencing  in damping nominal  wageincreases.  On that basis, models embodying that  mechanism suggest that there  is considerablepotential  for deceleration  in compensation  increases  over the  coming quarters.  As the  pressures inthe  labor markets abate in  our forecast,  these factors combine  going out through  1999 to producewhat I think is likely to be  some moderation in spending.

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  One factor in thinking about  the  spending outlook is that it isconceivable  that  as variable  pay becomes  more important,  profits  will become less  variable  andlabor income  more variable.  That is, when there is  a slowdown  in the  expansion,  more of it willshow up in the form of a  slowdown in labor income than in  capital  income.  Past estimatestypically have indicated higher marginal  propensities to consume  out of labor income  than out ofcapital  income than had previously been  the case.  If those propensities  were to remain the same,the  implication would be  that consumer  spending could be more  cyclically sensitive.  Arguing fromfirst  principles,  however, one  might think that those marginal  propensities  to consume  wouldchange if in fact people  began  to recognize  that their labor income  was indeed more  variable nowthan in  the past.  In essence,  the  marginal  propensity to consume  out of labor income should shrinksomewhat as consumers perceive that  any movements in their labor income may now be  moretransitory than was  the case  earlier.  Those are just some conjectures  about how  changingcompensation  practices could affect  spending.  Consumer  income might become more  variable andspending more sensitive  to income changes  if people continued  to consume  out of permanentincome as they have  in the past.  That effect  might be muted to the extent that their behavioractually  changes  when they recognize  that the  sensitivity of their labor incomes  to changingeconomic  conditions  has increased.8/18/98

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  There  certainly are  a  lot of studies  that  suggest that the  marginalpropensity  to consume  would be  lower if variable  incomes  were  expected to regress to Friedman'soriginal  permanent income  levels.

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  That might be  true at least  for those people who  are not living  essentiallyfrom hand to mouth.  I think a lot of these flexible pay  schemes tend to  affect  people who  are in theupper income brackets  and  have no liquidity constraints.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Payments  that are directly related to labor recruitmentand paid to  outside  agencies in one form or another obviously are not included in  measures  ofcompensation  per hour.  But am I  correct in assuming that such payments  are of an order ofmagnitude that suggests  we should be  adjusting  compensation per hour to include them as costsin our models  that interrelate  market tightness  with wage change?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Maybe  not with  wage change,  but with total labor costs in some  way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  meant compensation.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Theoretically  you might  want to include those payments  as your argumentsuggests,  but I don't  think we  have  any data  that quantify  them.  I suspect  that  they are not a hugeelement in the picture.  On  top of that,  we have  payments that actually  go to employees  that arenot counted  in the ECI.  The reason is that they are  regarded by the definitions  used in the ECI asout of scope because  they are recruiting  expenses.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Shouldn't  the value  added  of personal  service  or helpservice  groups  like Manpower  all  be directly related  to this?8/18/98

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL. Yes, except to the  extent  that in  a sense  they also are  substitutes  for theinternal management  of labor resources.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  is true.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  If you eliminate  a janitorial  function  and outsource  it to another firm, thatfirm is taking over various  fixed  administrative-type  costs.  The analysis  gets complicated.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  In  that  sense, there  is an argument for including internalcosts  of employment  administration  in those data as well.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Obviously this is an  incredibly complex  matter.  As  I said, I hope that weare going to make some headway in  our effort to discern the effects that some  of these changingpractices have  on the cyclical  variability  of spending.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I want to go  back to your previous comments  about folding  inexpectations  about  Y2K problems into the forecasts.  In  looking through  a number  of forecasts forthis meeting, I noted that DRI seems to be the only one  that explicitly deals  with the year 2000problem.  However, it does so only in  the context  of a boom/bust  scenario and not in theiralternative  scenarios--the  baseline  and the pessimistic  scenarios  as they call them.  The scenariothat they have  had for some time puts us behind the curve in  1999, has us increasing  fed fundsrates  to catch  up with inflation at that point, and has the boom/bust  scenario  aggravated by aninventory accumulation related  to the  year 2000 problems.  I had a feeling that their model resultswere rather marginal with regard to that inventory  swing, at least insofar  as they see the  data.They already  have  a swing taking place in the boom/bust scenario  and inventories feed into it inthe same  direction.  Otherwise,  inventories  do not  seem to have  much of an  impact on  theiroverall statistical  analysis,  at least as  yet.8/18/98

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank you.  First, on Cathy's point,  I would think that even  peoplewho believe that  there is not going to be  a significant  problem because  of the  century date changewill find it prudent to stock  up before the hoarders  get all  of the  supply.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Only those  who read  or work on the Internet!

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  I have  a couple  of questions that relate to  the staff presentations.  Thefirst is  directed  to Ted Truman  on imports.  I don't know  anything  about the  mechanics of puttingthe import data  together, but it would seem to me that in times like this, unraveling  the crosscurrentsbetween  volume effects  and price effects  is very complicated.  A dollar today buys boatloads  moreof Indonesian goods than it did before.  I do not know  what is happening  to the rupiah prices  ofgoods,  especially the costs  of exportable goods.  We have a retailer on our board  who reports  that heis importing  a lot more from Asia,  and his import bill  has gone down.  That says the volume effectsdid not swamp the price effects.  How should we  think about these import numbers, given  thisexchange  rate and  pricing problem?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  The answer to the first part of your question is  that  we have  aggregateprice  and aggregate  quantity numbers.  The  aggregate  price numbers basically come  from the BLSsurvey of import prices.  There  are  problems with  those import prices, and what we do is to take  anominal  total and  deflate by an index  at various  levels  of detail to get real  figures.  The quality ofthe price data is  substantially better than it was  20  years ago.  We  used to  have something  called"the  unit  value,"  which  really would have led  you to ask this question.  On  the other hand, it also isnot clear what we are  now getting  with the price data  or what question  they are  answering.  That'sbecause  it is unclear what the relationship is between  the price  that is quoted on an  invoice  and8/18/98included  in the index  and the price  at which  the  sale actually  is made and embodied in  aggregatedemand.The other point is exactly what I was  trying to  say in response  to Bob Parry's  question.We do have disaggregated  price  indices by area,  and we  can see what has happened to  the priceindex for the Asian countries.  That has declined  dramatically.  You may then say that the nominalamounts  of our imports from them have  been  flat, so the increase  in real  imports has beensubstantial.  I think the only point that we  can  make here is that we have  a J-curve  effect.  Wemight have expected  that J-curve  effect to have run its course earlier.  I have  not been able to lookat the detail  of the numbers  that came out today,  but there have  been  stories,  for example, relatingto some industrial  supplies.  You probably  have heard additional  stories  about  iron and  steel, forexample,  some involving Korea.  The trouble  is that  we  have a third factor, which  is the  generalweakness  of commodity prices.  In fact, one  of the surprises in the data that came  in today  wasthat June  exports and imports  of industrial  supplies  were much  less than we had anticipated.  Iasked the same question  you  are asking,  is this shortfall  nominal or is it real?  The  answer may besome of both.  A lot of it may well be nominal,  in which  case real  would be less.  The analysis isvery complicated.  The other thing you  want to remember is that  although conceptually  we thinkabout exports  and imports as being final demand, they are not.  Very  few imports  go directly fromthe  ship or the  plane to the supermarket  shelf.  As  a result, the way they  get imbedded in theproduction  and therefore  the  price  structure is  very complicated,  and it probably has become morecomplicated  in recent years.  Just-in-time inventories,  reduced transportation  costs,  and thereduced  weight  in GDP which the Chairman  likes to cite mean that the way  these things  getintegrated accounts for much  less of GDP.  That is probably one  of the reasons  why simple rulesof thumb for exchange rate depreciation  or exchange  rate changes  and inflation  have tended to8/18/98break  down.  Another reason may be  that we  are not talking about just two countries.  We aretalking  about the  increasing  number of sources  of imports to be  traded, as in the Indonesia  pointthat you raised.

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank you.  I also  have a  question about  the Greenbook's outlook forthe U.S.  economy and  the emphasis on  wealth effects.  Following up on your response to BobParry, it seems on the  surface that  there might  be some logic and even some  indirect empiricalevidence  in  support of these wealth  effects.  People  are behaving  in recent  months and quarters  asthough their permanent  income is either  above or has risen relative to their measured income.  Theindirect evidence  of that shows  up in measures  such as  the personal saving  rate and  so on.  I donot know how much weight  to give to  all of that.  But suppose the  central bank does  givesignificant weight to  that kind of phenomenon,  how do we  then avoid incorporating  views  aboutequity markets  in the formulation  of monetary  policy?  We  would run into the problem we  havediscussed  before  about somehow  using the level  of the stock market or changes  in the stock

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I do not think that you need to go that extra  step.  The stock  market isin effect  one of the financial  market channels  through which  the impulses that the Committeegenerates through  open  market operations  create a financial  environment  that influences thegrowth of aggregate  demand.  Exchange rates are  another channel.  We  also would include thebond market  and the shape  of the  yield curve.  We can think about what the  consequences  of theCommittee's  actions  might be  with respect  to the bond market if we were to change money8/18/98In any event, the  whole complex  of financial  variables  does influence spending  decisions.  I don'tthink you  can  avoid that conclusion.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  That is the reason  I asked the question.  As I read the Greenbook  and Ithink about the outlook for the balance  of this year  and next year and the emphasis  you put on thewealth  effects,  I cannot help but think that my comfort level  with  that forecast  depends  on  what Ithink about the outlook for the  stock market.  If the Dow Jones Industrials  were to soar to 10,000by year-end, how do I avoid that?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  If you felt that the market was likely to start to rally again,  even  againstthe fundamentals,  and to spur aggregate  demand  in a way that you felt excessive  in terms of theinflation  prospects  that would  go with that,  I think that  would argue at the  margin  for consideringa tightening  of policy that you would not otherwise  have  wanted to institute  were  it not for thatexpectation.  Now,  what I think I heard from many people  around the table is that they  want toremain humble about their ability to  anticipate movements  in the stock  market, especiallynonfundamental  movements.  So, that might cause you  to be reluctant to  move with great  force  ona hunch  about which way the market would go.  But I think you have to have one.  It is manifestin the behavior of the  economy in the last couple  of years that the  stock market's  movements  areof considerable  importance.  You need to take a position on this.Mr. Chairman,  I might just add  one small  fact.  I can't say for  sure that we have thisnailed down,  but I am told that our first  look at the trade  data suggests that  about 3/4  of the  importsof capital  goods  would be offsets  to PDE.  So, we would have  weaker producers  durableequipment  expenditures than is written  down in the Greenbook.  However, the  GDP effects  aretrivial.  That is a tentative  conclusion.8/18/98

MR.  MCTEER.  The Eleventh  District economy  has continued  to grow  at  a healthy  butsteadily moderating  pace.  The  summer's  heat and drought combined  with the unending  financialand economic  troubles in  Asia are the two most important factors  contributing  to the  slowerexpansion of the Texas  economy.  Unless  the weather  changes  soon, this year's  drought  lossescould exceed the $5  billion of agriculture-related  losses that  occurred in Texas  in  1996.  Cotton isthe number one cash  crop in Texas, and cotton farmers'  losses currently  are greater than duringthe  1996  drought.  The  impact of the drought  also has been  severe  on the corn  crop and on  cattleranchers.  Although  the drought is causing  enormous financial  strains on  the agricultural  sector,  itseffect  on the  Texas economy  is fairly modest because  agriculture  is less than  1-1/2  percent  of grossstate product.The impact  of the worsening Asian  situation  is being seen in the Eleventh Districtthrough  reduced  demand for semiconductors,  lower energy  prices, the stronger dollar, andgrowing  strains  in Mexico.  Worldwide  chip sales have  continued to decline.  As  a result,  acouple  of manufacturers  have shut down their factories  three times  this summer to ease the  glut ofmemory  chips.  Sales of more  sophisticated chips,  such as digital  signal  processors, have beenhurt to a much lesser extent by the situation in  Asia.  In spite  of all this,  we are  seeing  aconsiderable  expansion  of the resources  going into the research  and design  of new chiptechnologies,  particularly  in Austin and Dallas.Oil  and gas  prices  are very  weak and my industry contacts  expect  them to remain  so.  Alot of new supply  from non-OPEC  producers  is scheduled  to come on  stream  in the near term.With the expectation  that low  oil prices  are here  to stay,  a number  of companies,  particularly  in8/18/98Houston,  are  beginning  to announce  layoffs  and other belt-tightening  measures.  As the dollar hasstrengthened,  it has made energy cheaper  in  dollar terms  but increasingly  expensive  in currenciesthat  have  weakened relative  to the  dollar.  This currency  value effect  has reinforced the  downwardprice effect from weaker Asian  demand.  Low  oil prices  continue  to adversely  affect the Mexicaneconomy,  and if this situation  were to continue, it would place considerable  financial  strain onMexico.The construction  and service  sectors remain  strong in  our region.  Residentialconstruction,  especially  apartment  construction,  has been robust.  A  shortage  of labor seems to beas important or more important than the  shortage  of concrete, which  I have mentioned before,  inlimiting the supply  of new housing units.  Office  vacancy  rates  have  begun to edge up  slightly andrent increases  have  slowed.  Employment  gains in the private  service  sector remain strong,  andwage pressures,  if anything,  have increased  slightly.Turning to the national  economy,  the Greenbook  is full of crosscurrents  and, like  theBible, can  support  many different points of view.  [Laughter]  Real  GDP  growth sloweddramatically in the second quarter, but inventories  were  largely responsible.  Wage inflation haspicked up, but price inflation  has not.  Money growth  has been excessive by historical standards,but market  measures  of monetary policy  reflect a  restrictive stance.  Perhaps  we  should back awayfrom the trees  and try to see the forest  the way historians might do  so several years from  now.What  historians are  likely to focus on looking  back to  1997  and  1998  is the  international crisisthat began  in  Asia last summer  and spread to  several  countries.  Currencies  and stock  marketscollapsed in one country after another.  Financial  conditions appeared  to be stabilizing for a while,but they subsequently  relapsed and a  second round of turmoil ensued that included  additionalcountries.  During this period of growing  deflationary  pressures,  with gold and oil and other8/18/98commodity  prices falling in dollar  terms, the dollar  rising against  most currencies,  the yield curveflattening,  import  prices  falling,  and most  measures  of price  inflation declining,  the FOMCadopted  and then in my opinion held on too long to a bias toward  tightening monetary  policywhose implementation  would have  exacerbated  these trends.  In my opinion,  the risks  were prettywell balanced at our last meeting,  and in my  opinion the downside  risks are  greater today and theconsequences  of policy mistakes  are  greater as  well.  In terms  of the  global context and ournation's  position in the world,  I think it is time to talk about  getting ahead  of the curve by easingmonetary  policy.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to make  clear that while  we were praying thatwe would not be humiliated by incoming  information,  there was no divine  guidance  when wedrafted the Greenbook.

MR.  MCTEER.  We  never really  suspected it!  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I did!  [Laughter]  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  The Seventh  District economy  suffered  aminor fender bender in June  and  July.  The  setback  was  only  temporary, and we are  back on themoderate expansion road now that the GM strikes  have been settled  and recalled  employees  areworking  overtime.  It will  take  a few months before  the inventory pipeline is  completely  filled, solight vehicle sales  in August may still be affected  by inventory  shortages,  as  was the  case in Julywhen reduced  incentives also depressed  sales.  Demand apparently remains solid as  automakersindicate  that light vehicle  sales in  August remain  slightly ahead of expectations  of about  14-1/2million  units  at an  annual  rate.Abstracting  from GM strike effects,  it does appear  that activity in some manufacturingindustries  has  slowed  over the past few  months.  In  particular, Asian developments  have adversely8/18/98affected producers  of paper, chemicals,  food equipment, agricultural  equipment,  and some otherheavy equipment.  For most of these industries,  however, strength  in other export markets  hasoffset  at least part of the  weakness  in Asian demand.  I spoke to a group  of steel  executives earlierthis  month and,  as Ted Truman anticipated, they were quick to express their concerns  about  steelimports from  Asia  and declining  prices  for steel  products.In our District, however,  almost  all  of the recent  weakness  in  steel  output has beenrelated to the  GM strikes.  We have  seen  some  slowing in  a few  construction-related  industriessuch  as  cement and gypsum wallboard.  Housing  activity remains  at very high levels, but we areobserving  smaller increases  than elsewhere in  the country  and smaller than we experienced earlierin  the year  during our unusually mild  winter.  Retailers  indicate  that consumer  spending continuesto surprise them on the  upside and recent reports  suggest  no pullback  in consumer demand.Labor markets remain  very tight, and the  Manpower survey  to be  released  next weekwill show  strong hiring  plans continuing through the fourth  quarter, with both the national  andMidwest results  after seasonal adjustment  at the highest levels in the  survey's 22-year history.The only weakness  is in durable  goods manufacturing where  hiring plans  have fallen  for thesecond consecutive  quarter.  The Manpower  survey results should be treated as  confidential  untilthey are released  next Monday, August  24.  Increasingly,  we are  seeing entire communitiesbecoming involved in the search  for qualified  workers.  For example,  2500 workers  are needed fora new  shopping mall  opening  up this  November in  a Detroit  suburb.  Recruiting is  going on  athigh  schools,  colleges,  senior centers,  and social agencies  like Goodwill  industries.  In addition,job  fairs started to be  held in  June and will include  one at the Pontiac  Silver Dome this October.Significantly, the  city of Pontiac  is adding a bus line to  the new shopping center and efforts areunder way to get  similar public transportation  to and  from Detroit.8/18/98Business  contacts  in the manufacturing  sectors continue  to say that competitionconstrains  their ability to raise prices.  Furthermore,  many  of our farmers  are  caught between  arock and a hard  place  as  weak Asian  demand  combines  with expected  record  soybean andnear-record  corn harvests  to push  grain prices lower.  But  we have  sighted  some  upward pricepressures  outside of agriculture.  In the trucking  industry, shipping  costs are  being affected  asempty trucks head  to the West  Coast  to bring back full  loads  of Asian imports.  We  were told thatseveral consumer products  firms are  planning to increase  prices this  fall.  One retailer  noted thatalthough prices  for new inventory  are lower,  they plan  to raise prices to consumers  by 3 to 5percent largely to offset  labor cost increases  of 4 to 6 percent.Turning to the national  outlook, at our last meeting I indicated that I thought  the risksfor the economy had increased  both on  the  upside and the downside.  News  since that meeting  hasconvinced me that while  the international  situation  has worsened, domestic  demand  continues togrow  strongly.  On the one hand, second-quarter  export  figures reveal  a deterioration  in theinternational  situation,  which continues  to be a  substantial risk to the U.S.  and the  worldeconomies.  Although  I am a bit more optimistic  than the Greenbook about the outlook for foreignGDP and its effect  on our exports, this sector continues  to represent  a big  downside risk.  On  theother hand, domestic  demand  continues  to grow  strongly.  Consumer confidence  is at a high  level,and employment  and income gains  remain  substantial.  Economic  fundamentals  for theconsumption  and investment  sectors  continue to look strong.  We see real GDP  growth for  1998in the 3  percent  range.  Looking to  1999,  there  is a great deal of uncertainty,  but  we expect  realGDP growth  to decelerate  to the 2 to  2-1/2 percent  range.  The  1999 projection  gives  a good deal  ofweight to  the deteriorating  international  situation  and that may be  overly pessimistic.8/18/98Consequently, I continue  to think the risks  are  tilted to the  upside.  In  any event, they are  large  onboth  sides.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, the Twelfth  District economy expanded  at a strong  paceduring the  first half of  1998.  Payroll  employment  grew  by 2.9 percent  at an annual  rate,noticeably above  the pace of growth in the  rest of the  United States.  Among District states,growth  has been  most rapid in  Arizona, Nevada,  and Washington  during recent  months.  Vigorousconstruction  and real estate  market activity has helped to maintain  the District's expansion.Construction  jobs have  grown at a sizzling pace  in  California and Nevada  this year, andconstruction  activity  remains at high  levels in most parts  of the District.  Although  District growthhas outpaced the  nation's this year, it has been  slower than  in  1997.  Oregon,  Utah,  and Idahohave cooled  the most, and employment  was flat or down  slightly  in the second quarter in thosestates.  Employment  growth  also is moderating in  California this year.  Among  sectors, slowergrowth has been  most evident  in durables  manufacturing.This slowing is consistent with  what might be expected  from the restraining  effects  ofthe East Asian financial and economic  problems.  Data for the  first five months  of 1998  comparedwith  the same period in  1997  show that growth in  total District exports has fallen  essentially tozero  following substantial  growth in previous  years.  This  slowdown  appears  to be almost entirelyattributable to East Asia.  For example, in  the first quarter of this year, California's  exports  to keyEast Asian countries  were down  about  13  percent compared  to  a year earlier.  Exports haveslowed substantially  throughout the District,  and Hawaii's  struggling  economy has been hit hardby additional  losses  in their Asian tourist business  this year.  Although  these effects may grow  asthe year progresses,  the problems  in East  Asia have not derailed the  District's expansion  so far.8/18/98Turning  to the nation,  it remains  to be  seen  whether the long  awaited  slowdown  will besustained  during the second half because  a good deal  of the slowdown  was  due  to temporaryfactors.  Despite these doubts, I think that  the most likely outcome  is moderate growth  of around  2percent  through  the  end of next year, with activity  being  restrained by problems in East  Asianeconomies, the high dollar, restrictive  fiscal policy, and relatively high real  short-term  interestrates.  The recent drop in  our stock market adds  another potentially  moderating  factor.The  news on inflation  certainly continues  to be outstanding.  The GDP price indexcame  in  under  1 percent  for the  second  straight quarter and,  as we  all know,  inflation  as measuredby that index  has averaged  only  1 percent  over the past year.  In our Bank forecast,  theunemployment  rate  does  not quite  reach 5  percent by the end of 1999.  This  low rate perpetuatesthe acceleration  in  the ECI  that we  have  seen over the past year.  However,  I expect  this pressureon price  inflation  to be offset by diminished  inflation  expectations,  the higher value  of the  dollar,ample industrial  capacity, falling  commodity  prices, and somewhat  higher trend productivitygrowth.  As  a consequence,  our forecast  shows CPI inflation  staying between  2 and 2-1/4  percent  forthe remainder of this year  and next.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The Tenth  District economy continues  todo relatively  well.  Year-over-year  employment  growth as of June  was better than 2 percent,slightly below the national  average.  Consumers  are  still  buying at a fairly brisk pace.Manufacturing  for the most part remains  strong,  although in  some areas,  especially  in Colorado,our contacts  have  seen  some effects  from  the fallout of the Asian crisis.  Construction  remainshigh  for the District as  a whole;  we are  experiencing  a  modest slowdown  but  from  extremely  highlevels.  Our agricultural  sector is  an area of weakness.  Like  the  Seventh  District, we are8/18/98experiencing  very large grain harvests  and large supplies  of meat, both beef and pork.  That ishaving  a  depressing  effect on farm prices  and farm income.  Labor markets  remain  very tight inthe District.  We are receiving  more reports  of wage pressures  going forward.Perhaps the most interesting  change  that is occurring,  though  very preliminarily,  is  inthe area of psychology.  We  hear more  negative talk  even though  we are  enjoying a  very strongeconomy.  People talk  about the good  times, but they  are more concerned  about whether  the  lattercan  continue.  Some  of that concern  relates to the outlook for energy.  I think it is  important for usto try to keep tabs  on such  attitudes  as we go forward.Turning  to the nation,  I think our District largely reflects  national  economic trends.  Ourprojections  point to strong domestic  demand  that is being offset  to an important extent by theexternal  sector.  We  also do not rule  out some  possible retarding effects  from the stock  marketcorrection.  We continue  to have  supply shocks that are  having favorable effects  on prices.  As Iadd all that up, I  see a fairly  tame projection  for inflation  going forward.  I cannot  help butwonder, given  Peter Fisher's earlier  comments  on the markets'  efforts  to assess  the outlook forinflation and the risks of deflation,  whether  we are not seeing  some of this negative  psychologyand  uncertainty  spreading  a little more widely.  I think that bears  watching as  we go forward.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  District economic  conditions  remainpositive,  but they are  perhaps  a bit more mixed than they were formerly.  I previously  have talkeda little about  the  emergence  of a two-tiered  economy in  our District, and the gap between  theurban economy  and the rural  economy  appears  to be widening.On the positive  side, consumer  spending  remains  strong.  Real  estate  markets  arehealthy.  Construction activity  is buoyant.  Most  recently, markets  for rental  apartments  have8/18/98become  very, very tight in  the urban  areas of the District.  Rents are  moving up significantly.Construction  will  undoubtedly follow  once  labor becomes  available.  Labor  markets  are tight.Just  one anecdote  on that issue:  The Minnesota  State Fair,  which is  a major activity in our part ofthe country as  you  might imagine,  gets under way in  about  10  days.  They are  short about 600 or700 temporary workers  that they need to hire to open  the Fair.  There  is, I would say, widespreadupward pressure  on  compensation,  and I think  it is  fair to say that labor is  becoming moremilitant, at least in  our area.On  the other hand,  in  the rural parts  of the District the problems in  agriculture  areserious,  as Tom Hoenig just mentioned.  Mining activity is  softening.  Energy  exploration  isslowing.  Some executives  from the paper industry told me recently that their industry is not doingwell.  They are talking a lot about the trade  situation  and the need in their judgment for  a lowerdollar.As  far as the national  economy is concerned,  I have  talked before about  what I perceiveas  the tension between  the  pace  at which  domestic  aggregate  demand is  growing versus  thegrowth in aggregate  supply  and how the two might ultimately be reconciled.  At the moment, itlooks  as if the  reconciliation  is  occurring through  the serious  and sustained  weakness in  Asia andthe squeeze  on domestic  profit margins,  with their attendant  effects on equity prices  andultimately their wealth effects  on the economy.  If those trends  remain in place,  I think theGreenbook  forecast  is  more likely to materialize  than I thought formerly.  I also think thathowever  this  plays out, the risks look to me  to be  very large.  The  Greenbook  forecast may be  agood central  tendency,  but the risks that  I see on both  sides  are  significant.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Because  the Sixth District economy is  littlechanged  since  our last  meeting, I will  try to keep my remarks  shorter than usual  this morning.Over  the summer,  the Sixth District  has continued its  steady but modest  expansion.  Retailersexpect  sales growth  to persist, and  a significant  number of new plant announcements  bode wellfor capital  spending.  There  have been  some recent  signs of slowing in our regional  manufacturingsector.  They showed up in the decline  in  our latest index  of manufacturing  activity and in,  asexpected, the export orders  component.  This information,  which came  in  after the Beigebook  wasprepared,  is supported by anecdotal  evidence.  However, the overall  prospects  going  forward arefor the Southeast economy to  continue to  operate  at a  high level.  I  see the outlook for growth  inour area as only slightly less positive than  at the time of the last FOMC meeting.A number  of special  negative factors  in  the District  have received a  lot of nationwidepublicity, but in  fact they  have  had no appreciable  impact on the overall  level of regionaleconomic  activity.  It is true  that the  drought has caused  substantial  losses in farm receipts  in ourDistrict, but our agriculture  sector has become  a much less important part of our regionaleconomy, the  sort of development that Bob  Mcteer indicated  also has occurred  in Texas.  Thefires in Florida caused  a temporary  slowdown  in the state's important tourism industry.  However,the losses from  postponing the Daytona 400  stock  car race because  of smoke from fires  are  greaterthan all the other losses due to drought  and fires  in the region.  The only other noteworthyintelligence,  and this  also has been commented  on by Bob McTeer  and Gary Stern,  is that we  arereceiving  an increasing number  of reports  of significant  increases  in wages  and benefits.However,  there is  still no  indication that  companies  are  able to pass those higher costs on to theircustomers.8/18/98On  the national  front, it seems to me that the  overall risks to the forecast  haveincreased,  as almost everyone  has commented.  The uncertainties  relating to the net  drag from theinternational  sector, particularly  Asia and Russia, are  being realized and are  proving  to be morenegative than expected.  However,  and again  I join others  in making this  comment,  the strength ofdomestic demand  based on continued  strong growth  of income  and employment  and what nowappears  to be considerable  momentum  in domestic consumption  and investment  are  importantsources  of upside  risk to the  inflation picture.The  recently released revisions  to GDP by BEA  have impacted  our forecast  to a greaterextent than recent market  developments.  They have  caused  us to raise slightly  our forecasts  ofsustainable  economic  growth, personal  consumption,  and  investment,  and they leave  metranslated into  future inflation.  Our real GDP growth  forecast  for the  rest of this year is  slightlymore optimistic  than  that in  the Greenbook.  Furthermore,  there are other differences  in theforecast.  They relate to the extent to  which the hypothetical  risks that I mentioned  previously willbe  realized.  In that regard,  they are mainly that we  see less of a decline  in business  investmentand consumer  demand than the Greenbook.  As a consequence,  we are  slightly more pessimisticabout the inflation  outlook.Finally, I continue  to  believe that policy is not seriously  out of line,  nor is it allowinginflation to  accelerate  though we  are predicting  a slightly worse  inflation  performance  over thesecond half of 1998  and into  1999.  Most  of the price  acceleration  that we project  reflects  theexpected  reversal  in the previously  favorable behavior of energy prices.  Having  said that,however, I do believe  that the overall  inflation  risks continue  to be slightly more on the upside  andthat now is not  the time for us to relax  or to let the depressing  effects  of the international  sector8/18/98divert our attention  from the projected  strength in the domestic economy  or our ultimate  goal of astable, low  inflation  environment.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.

MS.  MINEHAN.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The New  England economy remainsstrong, but weakness  related to  Asia and the  GM  strike and increased labor and  real estate  marketpressures are  evident.  Unemployment rates  for the region's  states  were a full percentage  pointbelow  that for the nation  in July, and job growth  was  a full  percentage  point above the region'slong-term  trend.  Part of the region's  labor market  tightness  is  due to sluggish  or even negativelabor force  growth  in the various New  England states in recent months.  Job growth  varies  fromstate to state;  it is  virtually flat in Connecticut,  Maine,  and New Hampshire  and  up about 3  percentin Massachusetts.The  Asian flu has hit New  England manufacturing,  with exports  to  South Korea  andTaiwan dropping  about one-third  and exports  to Japan  off almost  10 percent.  Manufacturing  jobsmeasured  by one  of the  surveys in Massachusetts,  fell sharply  in June and  then again in July;manufacturers  were the main contributors  to this fall.  This survey, Beigebook  contacts,  andanecdotal  reports all  suggest that  about half the manufacturers  in New  England have  experiencedundesired inventory buildups  and layoffs,  again  with much of this  attributed to the impact of Asia.At the  same time,  labor markets remain  extremely  tight.  Regional  consumer prices  arethought to be rising  slightly faster than the  average  for the nation.  Construction,  tourism, andservice jobs are expanding rapidly.  Real estate  markets, especially  in Boston  though  elsewhere  aswell, are tighter and commercial  vacancy rates  are  lower.  Technical  engineering  workers  are hardto find, even  for manufacturing jobs,  as are workers  in the tourism  industry where raiding workers8/18/98from competitors  is becoming  commonplace.  Large  and  small employers  report being forced togrant broad  wage increases  to  existing staff when new  employees are  hired at higher  salaries,especially  in technical  areas.  Hiring bonuses  are commonplace  even  for fairly low-level jobs suchas  restaurant positions  and telemarketing.Commercial  and industrial  lending at the District's large  banks grew  at rates  aboutdouble  that of the nation  as a  whole, and competition  among lenders reportedly  remains intense.However, of a large  national  insurance company,reports  that they see some widening  of spreads  related to  credit quality and the  beginnings of someslight restraint  in credit  markets.  That view is reflected  a bit in  the data, but unfortunately  itseems at odds with  the  System's  survey  of senior  loan officers.On the  national  scene,  we agree with the projection in the  Greenbook of a slowing  inthe pace of GDP growth  from the  first half of  1998  to 1999.  However, without a tightening  ininterest  rates, our estimates  suggest  somewhat  stronger growth averaging  above  2-1/2  percent overthe period.  We do see consumers  and businesses affected  by Asia, by rising  labor costs  that areputting a squeeze  on profits, and by a  sideways if not slightly lower stock market,  all of whichdampens consumer  enthusiasm  and reins  in business  spending.  However,  we do not seeunemployment  rising  to 5  percent nor inflation remaining  as quiescent  as in  the  Greenbookforecast.  These  differences  partly reflect different estimates  of the economy's  potential.  Ours is abit lower than the Board  staff's.  We also  assume  a somewhat  slower rise in unemployment  whenGDP is  growing at rates  below potential.  This reflects,  I think, a greater agnosticism  on our partas to  whether the  higher rates  of productivity  growth we have  seen  are cyclical  or more structuralin nature.  Thus,  we  do not see unemployment rising  above the upper four  percent range,  and ourestimate of inflation rises  to just about 3 percent by the fourth  quarter of 1999.  Clearly,  the data in8/18/98our projections  suggest  a good deal  more  upside  risk on the inflation  side than that  expected  bythe Greenbook,  but I would confess  to  some  humility about  these projections  as  well.With  that in mind, my concerns  at prior meetings  about the  stance of monetary  policyand the risks associated  with the  current  economic  situation have revolved  around  two issues.  Thefirst is that the risk of rising inflation,  given  tight labor markets,  is considerable  though  hard  to seeas yet except  in  the form of wage increases.  The  second  is that financial  markets  were fuelingspeculation  that, even in the absence  of inflation, could present  real risks.  The inflation  risksremain,  and I think the  recent data on the domestic  side  suggest  that they are  at  least as  strong asthey  were at  the time  of the last meeting.  But it seems to me that financial  markets,  bothnationally  and especially  internationally,  have interjected real  notes of caution.

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I,  too,  will  try to be brief.  Not a lot haschanged in the Philadelphia District.  The region  generally remains  strong,  although growth  hasslowed.  This is  showing  up in manufacturing  where the effects  of Asia are  apparent,  particularlywith producers  of building  materials, chemicals,  and machinery.  The same  phenomenon  of a highlevel of sales but slowing growth  is apparent  in retailing.  Although  the national  news reports  havespotlighted  the weakness  in  autos,  sales of automotive  products  apart from  GM products  generallyhave  been strong in our  area.  Construction  is robust, both residential  and commercial.  Thereof a lack of demand but I think because  of some  bottlenecks  related to the  shortage  of machineryand labor.  A  number of people  around the table have  commented  on the problems in  agriculture,and they certainly are  severe,  but I would like to add a footnote  to that.  Apparently,  "fat is back"and  the dairy  farmers  in my  District are pleased  about that.  People  want some  taste back in  their8/18/98food.  Milk fat prices  are up  and milk now joins red  wine, martinis,  and eggs in  making acomeback.  I have  heard complaints  from  dairy farmers  for years,  and it is nice  now and then  tohear something positive  from them.  Labor markets remain  tight in  our District,  although  wageincreases  are generally  moderate  and  the phenomenon  of not  being able to raise prices  is  stillheard among businesses  around the District.As  far as  the nation goes,  I  think the biggest  change  since  we last met is that  theproblems  in Asia and their spillover effects  appear to be  more severe or at least  make me  feel  asthough the global economy  is in  a more  precarious  situation.  U.S.  inflation  remains  subdued, andin my estimation  the  threat of a breakout  on the upside  has lessened.  So,  whereas  the risks inrecent months  were  thought to be more pronounced  on the side of greater inflation, they now  seemto me to be  more balanced.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The  SecondDistrict's economy has continued  to expand  at a strong pace  since our last report, led by real estateand construction.  Job growth  moderated  a little in June,  but it was  brisk in  the second quarteroverall.  Retailers  report continued  very good sales  in July, notably of home  durables.  Retailprices  were  steady last month and inventories  remained  at satisfactory levels.  Tight  real  estateManhattan but leveled  off in the  suburbs,  and  vacancy rates  generally were  steady.On the national  economy,  our forecast  is somewhat more  optimistic  on growth  and, notsurprisingly, we have  the CPI rising  a bit more between  now and the end of 1999 than does  theGreenbook.  But by and large,  we  are in sympathy with the Greenbook  forecast.  What I think  haschanged since  our last meeting  is the balance  of risks.  The risks have  moved from a higher8/18/98likelihood of rising inflation  to a situation  in which  that possibility  still exists but is at leastcounterbalanced  by the  possibility that both the  American  consumer and the American  businessexecutive  will become  more cautious,  with  the result that growth could be  reduced  to below  ourNew  York forecast  or that of the  Greenbook.  I am  not suggesting that  we fear a recession  butrather quite weak  growth.The international  situation appears  to  me to be  worse.  Japan's new  government  isdoing virtually nothing, and the political  opposition  has announced  its unwillingness  to  supportthe already inadequate  banking reform  legislation  that the government  has proposed.  Therecession  in  Japan, in my view,  is  at least  as likely to persist--with  continuing chilling effects onthe  rest of Asia and  the rest of the world--as  to bottom out and improve.  A weak  Asia, a  seriouslytroubled  Russia, and weakness  showing  up in  Latin America  all raise the likelihood that the flowof capital to the  safe havens  of the United States  and core Europe will not slow down but ratherwill continue,  making those  currencies  stronger  than they otherwise  should be.  I believe that  willlead to a political furor both in continental  Europe and  in the United States,  especially  as  peoplebecome,  probably appropriately,  unhappy with helping Japan solve  its problems,  to the degree  it issolving them, by  drawing in exports  from that country.I do  not recall  a time when there has been more uncertainty  in financial  markets.Although  there has been  heavy trading volume  in the U.S.  equity markets  in recent days,  thatseems to be concentrated  among speculative  investors.  In many other  markets, there  isconsiderably  less liquidity  as large  financial institutions,  both observably and from what they tellus,  react to  the uncertainty  by reducing  their trading positions.  That  strategy makes an  immenseamount of sense  at the  level  of the  firm, but it increases  market  volatility  because  of a lack ofliquidity.8/18/98I have felt for many months that watchful  waiting is appropriate  for this  Committee  butwith  a view  that the risks were  in the direction  of rising inflation.  Now I think that the risks  aregreater still but  much more fully balanced,  given  the perceptible  shift in the  direction  of the riskstoward inadequate  growth.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  autoworkers  in our part of the countryhave ended their  very welcome  summer break and have  gone back to productive  activities,  givingthe theme parks  and other tourist attractions  a little relief.  They  are looking forward to the  start ofschool  so that they can  get  a little more relief.  Everybody  is reporting record tourism traffic  of alltypes throughout  the region.Construction projects  continue to be announced  at a rapid pace.  I view it  as  a"tyranny-of-small-decisions"  effect.  Some people  might call it an aggregation  problem  becausevirtually every  metropolitan  area in  the region is  announcing  new construction  projects  on theassumption  that they will be  able  to import the needed  construction  workers  from someplace  else;the local construction  workers  are  all fully employed.  A  director of a construction trades unionsaid that the union  halls were empty, so they  are now providing training  to prisoners  and paroleesas well  as  lobbying  for increased immigration  of construction  workers,  as I have  mentionedbefore.  This is quite a dramatic  change in the attitude of unions that are  trying to satisfy thedemand for labor as they see it out into the future.  Nevertheless,  Pittsburgh  announced  that it isgoing to spend $1  billion to construct two new  stadiums  and a convention  center over the next fewyears.  Apparently,  Pittsburgh  is trying  to outdo Cincinnati,  which  is building two new  stadiumprojects if they can  find the needed workers.  Both cities  are trying to keep  up with  Cleveland,which  is completing  a new stadium  as  well  as a large assortment  of infrastructure  projects8/18/98downtown.  Like every other region of the country, billions of federal  tax dollars  are now  going  tobecome  available to  add to  local  spending for roads, bridges,  tunnels,  and rapid transitsystems--again  if the necessary construction  workers  can be found.  Our banking directors  andadvisory  council members  cite examples of what  they view  as the  overbuilding of hotels, motels,and retail  space.  They report that the deals  are being done at ever thinner margins,  longer  terms,less collateral,  or no collateral.I was interested in  the Board  staff's report on rents for commercial  space relative toprices  of commercial  structures.  Mike Kelley was at our board meeting  last week,  and one of ourdirectors,  the chairman  of National  City Bank, said he had read  in a newspaper that National CityTower had been  sold again.  His bank occupies  90 percent of the building  and has fixed rents  forseven  years.  The building  sold two  years ago  for $60 million,  eight months  ago for $80  million,and  last week for over $100  million.  Public  works infrastructure  projects  are being  announced  allover the District every week.  Tax collections  continue to be very  strong throughout the  area.Residential  construction  also  is very strong.  Some counties report that permits are  up over  50percent from a  year ago.  The only area of softness in  construction  is  industrial structures  wherethere  has been  a slowing in  new contract  awards.Overall,  the labor markets  are reported to be very  tight.  Turnover  continues  to  increaseand the quality of entry-level  applicants is reported  to  continue to deteriorate.  Retail  sales  werereported to be  surprisingly strong right  through the GM strike  period.  Retailers now  areconcerned that they will  enter the fourth quarter without adequate  inventories  of the right productsto satisfy  what they see  as very  strong consumer  demand.  Apparel  and specialty  stores haveexperienced  very strong  sales  and their earnings  should be at record levels  this year.  Last weekthe Cleveland purchasing  managers reported  the first increase  in  new orders  in  several  months.8/18/98Business  confidence  levels, one director  said, are  more  shaken by what they read about Asia thanby what they see in  the order books.  Our steel  industry  sources  say that consumption  levels  areexcellent,  perhaps  a record, but surging  imports have put downward pressure  on steel prices.  So,the domestic  steel  producers  are going to  start filing dumping charges  very soon  and join textileproducers  in  seeking  some protection  from cheap  imports.Turning to  the national  economy, much  like Bob McTeer I think that the time isgrowing nearer when  we will  have  to contemplate  an easing of our policy stance,  but my reasonsare  quite different  from his.  That's mainly because I think it will become increasingly  apparentthat  we first will have to tighten monetary policy to deal with the  speculative  imbalances  andexcesses  that are  accumulating  across the country.  Subsequently,  we will  have  to be flexibleenough  to respond promptly  once we get  to the other side  of this problem.  Over the last year wehave seen final demand  persistently exceed  our expectations  in  the context  of the rise in  equitythink that once  we finally do act,  we will  have  to be prompt in reading errors on the other  side inthe expectation  that we subsequently will have to back off a bit.Even though  we and everyone  else are happy about the  low inflation,  the lowunemployment,  and the good income gains  that we are  seeing in the nation, it would be very hardto  call this  a well balanced  expansion  at the present time.  We can  put a favorable  spin  on the pastyear by saying  that in view  of the  very strong domestic  demand, we  are fortunate that  the Asianeconomies fell  apart  at just the right time,  that their exports were  available  to meet our surgingconsumption,  and that their reduced demand for our exports liberated some domestic  industrialcapacity so  that the domestic  economy  did not spill over into rising inflation.  Or we could turnthings completely  around the other way  and say that in  view  of the Asian crisis,  it is really  a good8/18/98thing that the United  States  was enjoying  a  spending boom so that we could play locomotive  tothe rest of the world and lessen the adverse  effect on people in  those  countries.  But the  distortionsin our economy  are  becoming ever more obvious.  Manufacturing  has been hit hard whileconstruction  soars  to  unsustainable levels.  Goods  prices are  falling while  service prices  areaccelerating.  Returns to capital  have  risen to  historic levels as  a  share of total income  in theeconomy,  while returns to labor  appear to  have declined  as  a share  of the total.I will now commit  a little heresy in the  minds of some  folks.  In current  circumstances,the absence  of consumer price inflation  is not a sufficient condition  for financial  stability in myview.  It is  ultimately financial  stability, as  we have  seen in  our own history and in  othereconomies  around the world that is  the key to  maximum sustainable  growth.  When there is  afavorable  productivity  surprise,  it brings  with it an  acceleration  of the growth  of business earningsand in equity  prices.  It is a normal  cyclical  phenomenon  in any case,  but it is  accentuated  whenwe have a favorable  productivity  surprise.  That in turn translates  into increased  credit demands.So,  we see both bank and nonbank  lenders  face outward  shifts in the demand  for loanable  fundsand investment capital,  and then an increase  in  the derived demand  for bank liabilities.  But ifthose demands for credit  and investment capital  are accommodated  by an  acceleration  of moneygrowth, there  will be an  acceleration  of nominal spending  growth that manifests  itself in excessivecapital  accumulation,  inventory accumulation,  and even  employment in some  sectors  of theeconomy.I have  avoided talking about the  stock market because  I do not want to make the  samemistake  that Irving Fisher made  weeks  before  the crash  of 1929.  But there  was  another economistof the period, a New  Zealand economist,  Allan  Fisher, who wrote  an  analysis of the boom-bustcycles  of the time.  He was  following Dennis  Robertson,  Ralph Hawtrey,  and some  other8/18/98economists  who dissected the period of the  1920s  and the  1930s.  Fisher argued that sustainedperiods  of very favorable  developments  in productivity  led to  an exaggeration  of what he  calledfalse  profit signals or returns to capital.  If capital investments  were financed  through  anintermediary banking  process,  with or without moral hazard  problems,  there would be set inmotion  dynamics  that ultimately  would result in  an economic decline.  He,  of course, was writingin a period of the  gold standard  and arguing that  the price  level should be  allowed to decline inorder to avoid the  imbalances  resulting from these dynamic  forces.  Speaking  of gold, it isintriguing that the ratio of gold prices  in dollars relative  to oil prices is  about the same  today as  itwas  30 years  ago.  In  all  of the intervening  years,  the  ratios stayed in a fairly narrow  rangeexpressed  as  a multiple of gold in  dollar terms  to oil  in dollar terms.  That  is because  both areinternationally  traded commodities.  They do not look quite the  same in  yen or rupiah  or othercurrencies  that have  been weak relative to the United  States dollar.In  the end, shifting the supply schedule  of bank credit or other forms  of intermediarycredit  by increasing  the monetary base  in a passive  way by pegging an  overnight interest rate  inthe face  of a shift in the  demand  for loanable  funds is not the right thing to do.  We ought to beallowing a move up on a relatively fixed credit  supply schedule  and  let a rationing process  takeplace.  I still am  concerned  that the growth  of the monetary base  and the  monetary aggregates  thisyear is fostering  too much demand, and  we  are  going to pay  a price for correcting it.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole.

MR. POOLE.  Conditions in the Eighth District are  substantially the  same as they havebeen  in  recent months.  Labor markets  remain tight.  Labor  shortages  are  abundant, particularly  inprofessional  areas.  Builders are  unable to satisfy demand in  some markets.  The agriculturaleconomy in the Eighth District is  in fairly good shape.  There are  some areas  that have  had too8/18/98much rain and some too little, but on the whole  crops are  going to be  satisfactory.  In  sum,economic  conditions  are  about unchanged  in  the Eighth District,  but there  is an  ever so slightlyeasier or less buoyant  feel  to these  District conditions.I want to concentrate  my comments  on the national  economy.  I also want to talk aboutAsia from that perspective,  but I will begin by talking  about the balance between  aggregate  supplyand demand, putting Asia aside.  On  the aggregate  supply side, I think that we probably haveovershot full employment  and are  seeing evidence  of that in the upcreep  of wages and in the laborshortages that  are widely reported.  My casual  impression is  that we have rising numbers  of labordisputes  and time lost through  labor disputes.  There  have  been  a number  of strikes.  That  is astandard  feature of labor markets  that are  overstressed.  Almost independently  of what happens toaggregate demand,  I think we can  anticipate  slower growth  of employment  than we have had  aswe move toward a closer equilibrium  of supply and demand in  the labor market.On  the aggregate  demand  side, domestic  final  sales remain strong, and that was  true inthe second quarter as well.  Money growth, whether  we use M2  or a narrower  measure--I preferMZM because I think it avoids  the problem with  sweeps--is  up  substantially over the last year interms of both  measures.  It  has tapered down  a  little most recently,  but I  see no signs of a real  turn.Now,  how big is the impact from Asia?  Has that  slowed aggregate  demand  sufficientlyto put us on  a reasonable  track for the near future?  Asia accounts for roughly  25 percent of theworld economy.  If 25  percent of the world's economy gets  into deep  trouble, one  would expect  tosee a big impact on  the other 75 percent.  The question  here is  the magnitudes involved.  Consideran analogy  within the United  States.  Suppose  California  got into really big trouble.  Suppose  BobParry really screwed  up so that the whole  Twelfth District had a financial  crisis and  Californialooked  about like  Japan  and Nevada about like Indonesia  and Oregon  about like Malaysia  and so8/18/98forth.  Would that have  a big  effect on the  rest of the United States?  Well,  of course it would!That region  is fully integrated into a  single national  economic  area.  We use  the same currency.We have  a completely  integrated  capital  market.  The  labor markets are  closely interconnectedthrough a  lot of movement  of the  workforce.  The goods markets are  completely connected.  Thereare no  trade barriers  except  for a few  agricultural  barriers.  Trying to take fruit into California  maybe  a problem,  but that's  about it.The relationship  of the  Asian economies to the economies  of the rest of the world isquite  different.  The labor markets are not integrated  at all.  The goods markets  are integrated.The Asian economies  are open,  but nothing like  California and the rest  of the United States.Capital markets  are fairly well integrated.  There are  floating exchange  rates, but not a singlecurrency.  So,  there is  a very great difference between  25  percent of the  world economy in  Asiaand a comparable  piece  of the U.S.  economy.The question  is  how large are  the  impacts flowing  from Asia to the rest of the worldeconomy and particularly to the United States.  Total U.S.  exports  are something  on the order of14 percent  of GDP, and  our exports to Asia are  something on the order of 3  percent of GDP.These  are  rough orders of magnitude, close enough for back-of-the-envelope  calculations.  Ofcourse,  we are not going to lose all of our exports to Asia.  So, if we anticipate  a significant  effect,we have to rely on an  argument that says there are  substantial indirect effects  on other parts  ofU.S. trade that are  coming through  other countries.  Obviously,  as Europe loses  some  exports toAsia, European  demand  for U.S.  goods  may go down.  But it is critical  to get the magnitudes  rightand not be  seduced by the high visibility of the  Asian problems.  There is no  question that theseAsian countries  are experiencing  very severe  problems, but the question  is how big are theimpacts  flowing through into  the United States  economy  as  a whole.8/18/98The research  staff  at the St.  Louis Fed has  taken a  look at the disaggregated  U.S.exports  for the first five months  of this year relative to the first five months  of last year.  Theyhave broken  down our exports by two-digit  SIC  industry  codes to try  to get a real  feel  for themagnitudes  involved.  The effects  on some  of these industries  are very large.  At the top  of the listwe find that  SIC code  10--producers  of metallic  ores and concentrates--have  lost 50 percent oftheir exports to Asia.  In other words,  firms  in those industries  have seen  their orders of suchproducts from Asia cut in half.  Obviously, that is very visible.  Producers  of some other productslike refined petroleum  and related goods have  seen  their Asian  demand  decline by as much  as 47percent.  If we  go down the  list,  agriculture  and livestock exports to Asia are down  29 percent thisyear compared  to last year.  I will not read the  whole table.Of course, the relevant question  for the impact on the  U.S. economy  is not thosenumbers but the decline in  exports to Asia relative to the size of these  industries.  If we take theindustry that has  experienced  the biggest percentage  impact, metallic  ores  and concentrates,  whichlost 50 percent of its Asian business, that turns out to be  about  1-1/4 percent of the product  of thatindustry, using  1996  production  levels.  So, the loss of the Asian business amounted to 1-1/4  percentof the domestic  production  of that  industry.  That gives  us the right order of magnitude  in terms ofthe effects within  the United States.  The biggest impact for any  of these industries  is that foragriculture  and  livestock, which  lost about 2 percent of its business as a  consequence  of thereduction in exports to  Asia.  I don't know what the effects of the  Asian problems will be in otherparts of the world, but I think it is very important for us to  keep  the magnitudes  in the context  ofthe size of the market in the United States.  In  addition,  we should not forget the indirect  offsetsthat take place because  Asia  is not an  integrated  part of a  single  currency area within  the UnitedStates,  the point  that I made before.8/18/98I don't  think there  is any question  that  the risks in  the  outlook have become  greater inboth  directions.  If it turns  out that the impacts  from abroad  are  larger than  our best guesscurrently, obviously demands  in the United States  are  going to be  weaker.  There  may also besubstantial  financial  and political  uncertainties  stemming from  unrest in  some of these countriesthat would  have an effect  on our economy.  On  the other hand, it may well be that  the underlyingstrength  of nominal  demand  in the United States  is going to be little affected  by Asia and that wewill find ourselves  in  an increasingly  inflationary  environment.  I think the uncertainties  are quitesubstantial  in  that regard.  That is  about all I want to say at this point.  Thank you.

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The expansion clearly is  weakening.Real GDP according to the  Greenbook  is already below  the  trend growth rate in  this half year, andit falls even  shorter in the next half year.  Unemployment  rises in  all  of the  Greenbook scenarios.Depending on the  stock market,  the rate of unemployment  may  at least arguably  get  close to mydefinition  of NAIRU  fairly soon.  As one listens  to the Reserve Bank presidents, one hears muchmore  commentary than a few months  ago using words  like "slowing,"  "negative  psychology,""less positive,"  etcetera.Let me bring Asia back on the table.  The  Asian forecasts  are being progressivelydowngraded.  I believe  the  staff already  has moved  about one-fourth  of the way to its so-calledpessimistic forecast  of the last meeting in  this forecast.  The process  probably  is not completed.Even in  the present  forecast,  as  Ted Truman  commented  earlier, foreign  growth  is very weak.I will  talk a bit about the  strategy of policy.  I  am a believer in  conducting policy on thebasis of the funds rate as  opposed to using other indicators  such  as  the monetary aggregates,  gold,or any of a number of other indicators  that have been  suggested.  A problem  with the funds rate,8/18/98as I have mentioned before, is that a lot of attention  gets focused on  it and it becomes  verydifficult to change  it.  It  may even  become  difficult to  change any adjectives  we use to describeour approach  to it, such  as symmetry.  I think the remedy is  to make more changes  in  the fundsrate, and the world will get  used to the  fact that that is  the  way we operate.  A good driver  does notapply  steady pressure  to the gas pedal but rather tries to keep  the car going at an  even  speed.A few months  ago, I felt that  it was time  to raise  the  fed funds rate  a bit.  I now thinkthat the time is coming,  perhaps  very soon, when the right thing to  do may be to lower the fundsrate  a bit.  Whether a  lower rate is needed at this meeting  is very debatable, but the way things  aregoing,  I believe we could be  confronting this issue rather soon.  In all the staff documents  that Iread to prepare for this meeting,  the paragraph I liked best was on page 9 of the Bluebook.  Thatwas the justification  for a lower  funds rate.Having said that, I cannot question the current  stance  of policy very  much either.  If thereal interest rate is  about 3-1/2 percent,  steady  inflation  is arguably  about 2 percent,  and bothinflation  and unemployment  are reasonably  close to their target  values--this is  my own mentalversion of the Taylor Rule--policy  is roughly  about right  at this point.  The economy  may not bewell balanced in Jerry Jordan's  sense,  but I do think that in terms of the level  of the federal  fundsrate, it is hard to argue that we  are far away from where  we ought to be.  That means that  there isno significant harm in  waiting  a bit before we move in either direction.  But having  said that, Iwould like hereby  to announce  that I have joined the small but growing band of those who thinkthat  there probably  are  more downside than upside risks  at the  present time.

MR. VARVEL.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  It  is a real  honor for me to be hererepresenting our Bank  and subbing  for Al Broaddus.  You may know that Al's  son was married8/18/98this weekend.  He had  an extended  trip out of town.  He wanted to be  sure the Committee knewthat the economy of western North  Carolina was  receiving  a big boost this past weekend!The Fifth District economy continues  to grow  at a moderate  rate this summer.  Overallmanufacturing  activity picked up some in  July as a result of strong domestic demand,  especially inthe building materials  and capital  goods areas.  But, with much weaker  orders, our textile  andapparel  producers  continue to have a tough time.  Growth  in retail  sales  slowed somewhat,especially  in consumer durables,  but the nonretail  service sectors are  experiencing very strongrevenue  growth.  Real  estate activity and bank lending  remain  strong, and there is excess moneychasing  too few  investment opportunities.  The Charlotte area continues its very rapid growth,  andwe have  reports of a record  amount of new  investment there in  the first half of 1998.  Finally,District labor markets  remain very tight.  We continue  to hear frequent comments  from Districtcontacts about difficulties  in attracting and retaining  workers  and an increased  dependence  on thein-migration of workers,  especially in the construction  industry.On the national  picture,  I have a few  comments  about the  Greenbook forecast.  TheGreenbook  sees the  slowdown  in  inventory accumulation  and the deterioration  in net exports thatoccurred  in the  second quarter as setting the stage for a sharp  and lasting slowing in the growth  ofdomestic  final demand.  As  a consequence  of that slowdown  and a  further significant deteriorationin net exports, real GDP is expected to expand at a rate just below its  potential,  relieving some  ofthe pressure  on labor markets  and lowering  core  inflation a bit in coming  quarters.  It would bevery  nice if this chain  of events were actually  realized  and I hope it will  be, but I have  somedoubts.First, domestic  demand is expected to  slow  promptly to about  half its  average  pace inthe first part of  1998.  Given that labor markets  adjusted for the GM  strike  apparently tightened8/18/98further in July, pointing to  further real  wage growth,  I am not convinced  that domestic  spendingwill slow  as much and as  promptly as in the Greenbook  forecast.Secondly,  as  Mike Prell  noted earlier, the Greenbook  is forecasting  a much  greaterdeterioration  in net exports  than the Blue Chip forecasters.  In fact,  I noticed  that the Greenbook  isabout as pessimistic  as the average  of the  ten most pessimistic  Blue Chip forecasters.  TheGreenbook's  forecast of net exports represents  a drag on real GDP growth  of about  1 percent  inthe second  half of 1998.  By contrast, the  Blue Chip consensus  looks for a much  smaller drop  innet exports,  with much less drag on GDP.  I know  that foreign  trade developments  are verydifficult  to forecast  and I certainly  am not a forecaster, but on the face of it, the Greenbook  seemsto be at the low  end on this point.I  see considerable  upside risk  in the Greenbook  forecast of the economic  outlook.Inflation itself, continued  strong domestic  demand,  and the second-quarter jump in  the ECI areparticularly  worrisome.  The latter may indicate some  ebbing in  the productivity  growth that hasbeen holding down unit labor costs.  I also  worry that we are  at risk of a jump  in health  care  coststhat  would raise the benefit-cost  component  of the ECI.  And, as Mike Prell  pointed out, thespecial  survey data on variable pay  suggests  that the ECI may understate  compensation  costs.

MS.  RIVLIN.  We in  the FOMC tend to concentrate  on  what has  happened  since  welast met, this magical  period known only in this room as  the intermeeting period,  but I find itinteresting  to go back a little  further sometimes.  In this case,  I went back to March,  which  is onlyfive months  ago, and found  myself very impressed,  which  is a compliment,  folks,  with theforecasting  ability of the  staff.  The March  meeting,  as you remember, was  held near the  end of aroaring first quarter that proved to be even  stronger than  we expected at that time.  The  staff was8/18/98predicting,  albeit somewhat  diffidently, a drastic  slowdown in the  expansion  due  to inventoryskepticism  around this table, including my own, but in hindsight  it appears  that the staff made  aquite  good  forecast.  The timing  was  a little off; the first quarter  was  stronger and the secondweaker than they anticipated, but the basic  forecast of slowing to less than potential for the rest ofthis year and next looks  increasingly  right to me.  They  also called  the stock market aboutright--so  far.  Despite the reduced earnings  expectations that  are bound to occur with  slowergrowth, they expected  only a modest correction  in  the  stock market.  So far, that is  what we havegotten.What is evident looking  back even  five months  is that the Asian  crisis  is proving to bedeeper, more  intractable, and  possibly more contagious  than we  thought it would be a few monthsago.  Japan is more  deeply mired in  political  paralysis.  Other Asian economies,  especiallyIndonesia,  are  in more  desperate shape.  China, including  Hong Kong, Russia, and possibly Brazil,are more fragile than  we anticipated  at that time.Looking ahead,  it seems  to me  that the overheating  of the U.S.  economy is likely to beslipping  into the category of past  worries despite some evidence  of shortages of construction  andother workers  and of some  materials that have been  mentioned  around the  table.  We have learnedover the last couple of years that even  with  extremely tight labor markets,  our economy is muchless prone to accelerating  inflation than  we  thought it was.  Labor markets  now seem likely to easeup a bit  as economic  growth  slows.  That does  not necessarily  mean that we will avoid an uptickin inflation  in delayed  reaction to higher wages, possible increases  in  health care costs,  and someother factors  that have been  mentioned.  Indeed, we might be  in for a  bit of stagflation.  If thathappens,  we may unfortunately  have to  live with it.  It  is hard to imagine  raising interest  rates in8/18/98the face of softening  employment  and economic  growth that  is below  potential.  What has beenlearned before is that  we do not have  a very good tool to combat  stagflation if we  get  it.I suspect that domestic  overheating  and inflation  are  going to be fairly  low on  our list ofworries over the next few  months.  Rather, I suspect  that  we will be focused  more  and more  onhow to keep  the world economy--the  non-European,  non-North  American  economy--fromunraveling  further and how to mitigate the damage  to  our own economy.  It is not  hard to imaginethat world  growth, instead of recovering  modestly  in  1999 as  forecast in the Greenbook,  might geta  good deal worse  before it gets  better and that  recovery will  be delayed at least  until the year2000.  Our economy now looks strong enough  to weather  the storm  without a recession,  but itsability to do that depends  heavily on consumer confidence  and the absence  of a rout in the stockpsychology is  a fragile  thing.This all  adds up to saying that I believe  the risks are now  at least as much  on thedownside  as on the  upside and that not moving the federal  funds rate  is certainly  the right policyfor now.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  As I review  the current economicoutlook I am, like others,  struck by the strong but  at least currently balanced  forces that appear tobe shaping the future.  Potentially  weakening  developments  stemming from the external  sectorseem to be  balanced  against a currently strong  domestic  sector, although  some weakness  in  thelatter is  a possibility.  We also continue to see  a  dichotomy between  the  goods  sector, includingcommodities  and agriculture,  and the  service  sector.  I  think the links across these  various8/18/98balances  and dichotomous  elements  of the economy reside  in two areas.  One is the labor marketsand the  other is the financial  markets.  The challenge  to me is that this balance is quite fragileright now,  and it seems very much like a high-wire  act where  a move to either  side would be quitedetrimental.As others have  indicated, developments  relating to the  external  sector clearly  haveslowed the growth  of GDP.  The Greenbook  projections  suggest that  the external  sector will  slowthe expansion  less and  less going forward.  Therefore,  one  might think that it  should be less andless a  part of our deliberations.  However, the risk that I see here is that the  staff may haveunderestimated  the net drag that  will come from  the external  side.  I agree with  Ted Truman  thatits negative contribution  eventually will  turn around, but I  see some risk that the Japaneseeconomy will not turn  around  as quickly as  in the Greenbook  forecast.  The current  Greenbookestimates  that economic  activity in Japan  declined  at a 5  percent rate in  the first half of this year,and it  anticipates  a flat performance  in  the second half and an upturn to a low growth  rate in  thefirst part of next year.  That forecast seems  a little optimistic  to me.  Also, as the events of thisweek have indicated, global  contagion  is still very much  a risk that could undermine  fragilerecoveries  around the world.  The staff forecast,  as Governor Gramlich  indicated, has movedsome distance  toward  the so-called  "worse  case"  scenario.  I hope that that partial  movement isnot further abetted by unfolding  events overseas.  In any event,  the importance  of the externalsector is  much greater than the 3 or 4 percent of GDP that is accounted  for by the U.S. currentaccount deficit.The domestic  economy provides  a marked  counterpoint  to the external  sector.  TheGreenbook forecast  calls for some  abatement of what has been  very strong  growth.  Thatabatement  is based  to a very substantial  extent  on an  anticipated diminution  of wealth  effects.8/18/98Such  an outcome  is quite possible.  The recent  so-called  near correction  in  the stock market lendssome  credibility  to this  scenario.  However, as  others have  indicated, the  stock market  isnotoriously difficult to forecast. Therefore,  I would say  with respect  to purely domesticdevelopments  that I  sense considerable  tension between factors pointing to  an  overly  strongexpansion  and those that  suggest  a potential for some  shortfall in demand  from currentexpectations.  For me  at this point, those two sets  of factors  seem to be  roughly in balance.The  other set of mirror images  that we are dealing  with  is the goods  sector versus theservice sector.  It is clear that the goods  sector has thus far taken the brunt of the adverse  impact offoreign trade developments.  Goods  exports  and imports  seem  to account  for almost all of the netexport drag that we have experienced.  Additionally, the  goods  sector has been an importantplayer in the recent performance  of the domestic  economy in that the swing in inventoryinvestment  was a key factor  in the shift of GDP from very rapid  growth in  the first quarter tomuch reduced  growth in  the second.  Forward-looking  indicators,  such  as recent purchasingmanager surveys,  show  some  weakness in the  goods sector  going forward.  However,  I thinkthere are  some  signs  of strength  even  in that  sector.  While there  was a slowdown  in the buildupof inventories in the second quarter,  stock building was  still substantial,  something  like 6 percentat an  annual  rate.  For its part, the  service sector is  a clear story of strength  building on  strength,and the Greenbook forecast shows that as basically continuing.The  linkages across these various  elements  of our economy  may be seen,  as I said, inthe labor markets.  The overall  labor market  is obviously tight  and likely to stay tight.  Thetightness  seems  to be discouraging  some layoffs  in industries  that have been affected  by theexternally induced drag.  Not surprisingly, the  strength in demand  also has forced employers  inother sectors  of the economy, in the service sector in particular, to increase  the number of workers8/18/98that  they employ.  So,  it seems to me  that the unemployment rate,  as  the Greenbook suggests,  islikely to  adjust very slowly to a moderating economic  expansion.  While I think the labor marketswill be slow  to adjust,  we will see and  have seen  that financial markets are  quite quick to adjust,and they add a degree  of volatility to the economy.I think  the potential interplay  that we are  starting to see between  corporate profits,  stockvaluations,  and consumer performance  are the elements  that  are most relevant  to us.  I believe  theyrepresent  the main  sources  of risk to the forecast.  The staff forecast  depends  on this volatility andan adjustment  in equity  prices to more conservative  profit outlooks to bring the various elementsof the economy into an equilibrium  at a lower, indeed  subtrend, growth rate.  Unfortunately, Ithink there  are many risks  to this  "immaculate  slowing"  forecast.  The most obvious stem fromthe weaknesses  in foreign  economies  and the international  financial turmoil  that continue  to takesome toll on psychology  and real  economic  performance.  On the other hand, tight labor markets,which the  staff currently expects to have little  impact on prices, could potentially translate intogreater inflationary pressures  than  the staff has forecast  if businesses  attempt to maintain  profitthat is expected to  come from the stock market  may not be  as strong as the  staff has forecast.Overall,  I think the risks are  larger in both directions,  and  unlike where I was at the lastmeeting, I now believe they are quite balanced.  However,  I see it as a delicate balance,  and I thinkour current role is  to do as little as possible  to upset  the various  forces that affect  the economy.By sitting still  now, we run the  smallest  risk in a scenario  that is fraught with uncertainties,  noneof which is  of our own making.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.8/18/98

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I expect  both slower growth  and higherinflation  over the next year and  a half.  However,  I expect  faster growth than in the Greenbookforecast,  with the rate  of expansion  in GDP closer to trend  and a  slower rate of increase  inpotential  output.  These two factors combine  to yield a  lower path  for the  unemployment  rate thanis indicated  in the Greenbook.  In part because of this,  I am skeptical that the recent pattern  of arising rate  of increase in  nominal compensation  will reverse next year, an  outcome central  to theGreenbook  inflation  forecast.The  story underpinning the  forecast of a persistent  slowdown  in growth to below trendbegins  with a  sharper external  drag associated with the turmoil  in Asia.  The resulting decline innet exports  is projected  to slow  GDP growth.  The multiplier-accelerator  effects  of the slowerGDP growth  then moderate  domestic  demand,  reinforcing the  slowdown in  GDP growth.  If forgood measure  we add a  stock market  correction that is sharper than might otherwise  occur in  aperiod  of slowing expansion  to reflect  some  initial overvaluations,  we get  a slowdown in  GDPgrowth that carries into  1999 even though the external  drag is fading.  It is a good  story.  I havetold it more than  a few times myself.  I think it is the story in  the Greenbook, with the importantsubstitution of a realized  for a projected  stock market  correction.What is  wrong with  this picture?  Well,  it does not seem to fit the facts of the first halfof this year very well.  The  story in the first half was not that of a significant slowdown in GDPgrowth. The economy  grew  at a 3-1/2  percent rate  in the first half despite a subtraction of 2-1/2percentage  points  stemming from the decline in net exports.  This GDP growth  rate is  only 1/4percentage  point slower than over  1997,  and it is fully accounted  for by the  GM strike.  True,growth was unbalanced in  the first half in terms of the pattern  of growth  in the first  and second8/18/98quarters,  but this difference  was  almost entirely associated with the pattern  of inventoryinvestment.The real  story in  the first half was  that a  stronger-than-expected  advance in privatedemand  was offset by a sharper-than-expected  decline in  net exports, leaving  GDP growth  aboutunchanged.  That outcome  suggests at least  a couple of questions.  First, why did private  domesticdemand accelerate?  Second,  why should  private  domestic  demand now weaken  so sharply as  inthe staff forecast when  there  are no  multiplier-accelerator  effects  to  speak of stemming  fromslower growth  in the first half?  One piece,  but only a piece,  of the puzzle  of the furtherstrengthening  in private demand  may be the  same Asian turmoil that was  reflected in thesharper-than-anticipated  decline  in net exports.  That  turmoil resulted in at least $3  of the  perbarrel decline  in oil prices  and was  accompanied  by a  shift in portfolio preferences  in favor ofdollar-denominated  assets that contributed to lower intermediate-  and long-term  interest rates  inthe United States.But the key  question in the  forecast is, what will now induce  a slower rate of economicgrowth in the second half  and into  1999?  It is not the external  drag.  The decline in net exports  inthe second half is about  half as  sharp as in the first half, and the  decline  then halves  again nextyear.  Therefore,  in order for GDP growth  to moderate  going forward,  the slowing in  domesticdemand must be aggressive  enough  to more  than offset the diminishing  external  drag.  Thebottom line is  that we need a story other than just external  drag to explain  the slowdown  in  GDPgrowth  going forward.Part of the story is clearly the stock market decline,  but this is not enough.  TheFRB/US  model forecast  identifies  a second key  underpinning  of the slowdown  scenario,  and onethat, I expect, is  also a factor in the judgmental  forecast.  I call  it the "X"  factor in that it slows8/18/98growth through  gravity.  It reminds  me  of my defense of a forecast  of a sharp  decline in long-termrates  in  1993.  When I was asked  why long-term  rates were  headed lower, I responded that it wasbecause they were too  high.  The FRB/US  forecast talks  of error correction  rather than force ofgravity, but it's the same  story.  Many private-spending  components  have expanded  at a rateabove  what that model and most other models  predicted.  This was true by the way during  1997but perhaps  even  more  so during the first half of  1998.  Now, these spending  components areprojected  to return  to fundamentals,  hence the economy  slows.  There is nothing wrong with thisstory, but it is  not an overwhelmingly  compelling  one, especially in terms  of the  timing of theslowdown.  As a result, I have  some doubts about  the degree of the slowdown  in the staff forecast.The  second major call  in  the staff forecast  is for a reversal in the recent trend towardfaster increases  in nominal  compensation.  This is partly  due to  a rising unemployment  rate andpartly to the pass-through  of lower inflation  expectations.  The case was  quite carefully  argued inthe Greenbook in terms of a range of forecasts  from different  wage-price  models.  Again, such anoutcome is possible,  but I remain  skeptical.Given the uncertainty about the structure  of the economy  and the forecast  goingforward, it is likely that collectively  we will  become more reactive in terms of policy response.This  makes reading the inflation  data for signs of a change in the underlying trend  moreimportant.  But this also  has become  more difficult.  I have noted before,  for example,  that  thecore CPI data hinted at a rebound in the underlying  inflation rate  based on three-month  andsix-month inflation  rates.  However, taking  account of the last two  months of CPI data, thethree-month  inflation rate  of core CPI has receded from above 2-1/2  percent to about 2 percent,  verymuch  in line with the  staff forecast  for the second half of the year.8/18/98The data for the chain  measure of GDP prices  show, in  contrast, a remarkable  slowingin the rate of inflation.  The four-quarter  rate of inflation  for this measure  has  declined  steadilyfrom 2 percent  in the  second quarter of last year  to  1 percent in the  second quarter of this year.The slowing  in the  quarterly inflation  rates occurred  quite abruptly  in the third quarter  last year.Inflation by this measure  has now been  near 1 percent for four consecutive  quarters.  Thewidening gap  and different trends in the alternative  measures  of inflation  are making  our job ofreading inflation  signals more  challenging,  but on balance  they are showing  few  signs of buildinginflation pressure.The last topic  I want to comment  on is the risk to the forecast.  Given the tightness  inthe labor markets,  the  lack of compelling evidence of a persistent slowdown  even  to trend growth,and the  likelihood  of some diminution in  the favorable  supply shocks, there remains a risk ofhigher inflation  going forward.  The other major risk is that of a still worse outcome  from theAsian  turmoil.  The forecast  embodies a  sensible central  tendency for this external  effect.  It  stillappears to me,  however, that the possibilities  relative to the central tendency are  asymmetrical.  Isee more chance  of a  much worse outcome  than a much more favorable one.  For this reason, Ibelieve the risks to the forecast  have  become  more balanced than I  viewed them earlier.  Thankyou.

MR.  KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The morning has moved well along  and Iam  the last in the  queue, I believe, so I will  be very brief.  At the last meeting,  the Committee waswrestling with the  very uncomfortable dilemma of having two sets of concerns that pulled in verydifferent directions.  We have  been  wrestling  with the same concerns  all  morning.  The questionfor today seems  to be  what has changed over the last few  weeks.  The  answer perhaps  is that not8/18/98much has  changed fundamentally  and  definitively, but I think there are  some potentially  verysignificant  straws in  the wind.  Thanks  to inventories  and Asia, the expansion  slowed dramaticallyas  expected in  the second quarter,  confronting  us now with the question of whether  or not thismoderation  will  settle  in  as a new  regime as  suggested by the  Greenbook.  I thought the case thatwas  made there  was quite  impressive.  But if the stock markets  still have the  stamina for one ormore bull runs left in them, confidence  could be reinforced  and  we could again  easily findourselves in  an excessive  growth  mode for much, perhaps  all,  of the forecast  period.  Thatobviously could present  significant difficulties  in the long run.  My  assessment is that domesticrisk remains  on the  upside but perhaps  not so heavily as earlier.  The  next several  months  shouldtell that tale.Internationally,  one is hard pressed to identify any news  of improvement.  To thecontrary,  deflationary pressure  seems  to be  increasing.  Japan appears  to be fumbling the ball,which may further endanger  the entire  region.  Long-held fears  of contagion  with  some boost fromweak oil prices  have become reality and  have impacted Russia  and parts of Latin  America.  Thedownside risk seems  to have  intensified outside our borders,  calling even more  strongly forcaution.We  still have  the bifurcated mix of factors  that existed on July  1.  My sense,  however,is that for the moment at least, the upside  domestic concerns  may be  a bit  milder while  thedownside international  concerns may be cause for even  more caution.  While both  of these  strawsin the wind  now blow in  the same direction  and  suggest  a softening expansion  as a risingprobability, I do not think that this  warrants  a change  in our policy stance  at this  time.  But we aremoving toward more balanced risks.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Mr. Kohn.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  In  opting to  keep the stance ofpolicy unchanged  at recent meetings, the Committee  has been balancing itsexpectation  that policy most likely will  need eventually  to tighten  to forestallan uptrend  in inflation  against the possibilities that developments  in  theglobal  economy could make that tightening unnecessary  and  that any rise inthe federal  funds rate might worsen  instabilities  in foreign  financial markets.Living with the  risk of rising inflation  has  been made  easier by the low levelof actual  inflation  and by the prospect  that, despite  tight labor markets,inflation  will not turn up for some time.  Given  that prospect, waiting totighten--in  order to be in a better position  to judge  the course ofdevelopments  overseas and inflation  dynamics  in the United States--probablywould not deprive the Committee  of adequate  time to head off a  significantpickup  in inflation  that would be  very disruptive to reverse,  even  allowing  forpolicy lags.Developments  since  your last meeting  would seem  mostly to reinforcethe arguments for standing pat.  The rise in volatility  and in  contagion  acrosscountries  of movements  in financial  asset  prices suggests  that investors  aremore fearful  and  uncertain and that many markets  remain quite vulnerable  toa tightening of monetary policy in the United  States, especially  if the policyaction  were unanticipated  and not clearly dictated  by an obvious threat ofhigher U.S.  inflation. And, the deteriorating  situation overseas  is reflected  ina higher  dollar and lower commodity  prices  and in downward  revisions to  thepath of foreign  economic  activity, which  will help to contain pressures  onresources  and prices  in the  United States.Moreover,  the reactions of U.S.  financial  markets  of late to thedeteriorating  situation  overseas on balance  are reinforcing the  restraint onaggregate  demand. This is in contrast to earlier when domestic  markets  wereresponding  to foreign  turmoil  in ways  that seemed to support more domesticspending, partly offsetting  the damping  of net exports.  To be  sure, interestrates on Treasury  obligations have  dropped  still  further, but the  adverseeffects of the higher dollar and weaker foreign  demand on profit prospectshave contributed importantly to the recent  decrease  in equity prices  and risein credit risk spreads.  The cost of raising capital  for U.S. businesses  probablyhas  risen a bit in recent weeks,  and  previous  gains in household  wealth havebeen trimmed.  The key question  is whether these  recent market movementsrepresent  a more lasting reassessment  of profits  and risk or  are simply anotherhiccup in investors'  persistently optimistic  view of business prospects.  If thestaff profit forecast  is  in the right ballpark,  such optimism  should provedifficult to reestablish.8/18/98In addition,  much  of the  decline in Treasury  interest rates  in the last fewweeks,  and even  in  the last few  months, may represent  a fall  in inflationexpectations,  rather  than in real interest rates, limiting its stimulative effecton  spending.  In the Michigan  consumer survey, for example, partial  data forand the next 5 to  10 years;  expectations  over both horizons  have  fallen acouple  of tenths  in the last two months,  bringing the decline in medianlong-term expectations  to half a percentage  point this year.  Using thesemeasures, rate  declines in recent months or even since December entirelyreflect longer inflation expectations.  This conclusion  is supported by theslight upward creep in yields  on inflation-indexed  securities  over this  period.It may be that the downward pressure on real  interest rates stemming  fromoffset by upward pressure  arising from increases  in  expected real  short-termrates over the near term as inflation expectations  fall  relative to the forecastof an  unchanged nominal  funds rate.Of course, not all developments  over the intermeeting  period point toreduced  inflation risks. So far, private final  demand remains  quite  strong,counterbalancing  the restraint  coming from the foreign  sector and lowerinventory  investment by enough  to keep income  and employment  growing  ata good clip.  And, as a consequence,  pressures  on labor markets  show  fewsigns yet of becoming less intense.Moreover, financial  conditions continue  to be accommodative  forspending.  Price-earnings  ratios are still extraordinarily  high, holding  downthe cost of capital,  and consumption  has not yet caught  up to the previousrun-up in wealth. Even  if real interest rates have not fallen,  recent declines innominal interest rates  will boost mortgage  borrowing  and spending,particularly for those  households  who feel constrained by limits on  availableliquidity  or cash flow.  And, according to our August survey of loan officers,more domestic  banks still  are easing terms on  business loans  than tighteningthem,  though by a smaller margin than in  the previous  few  surveys.  Lastly,although  money growth  has  slowed somewhat  in recent months, measuredover the more relevant time frame of the last few  quarters, the aggregatescontinue  to expand rapidly--more  rapidly,  if they continue on  these paths,than likely would be consistent over time with nominal income growth in linewith the  Committee's  desire to keep inflation very low.Perhaps  the immediate question  for Committee  consideration  is whether,on balance,  conditions  have changed enough  to warrant  a return to asymmetrical  directive.  The Greenbook forecast would seem consistent  withsuch a move in  that, at an  unchanged  federal funds rate,  it sees inflationremaining  quite damped. In that forecast,  the rise in  inflation  has become8/18/98even  more gradual;  indeed, no longer does the rate  of increase  in the core  CPIdrift higher in  1999--even  after allowing  for technical  changes to the  index.Moreover,  the  Committee might be more confident now than at previousmeetings  that the slowing  of domestic  demand likely needed  to  containinflation pressures  is in  train.  For the first time,  the reduction  in wealthcritical to that moderation has actually  happened, not just been projected.  Todate, the  restrictive  effects of high real interest rates on aggregate  demandhave been offset  importantly by the rise  in equity prices.  But if those  pricesdon't rebound, much less  fall  further as  seems possible  with the staff outlookfor profits, the restraining effects  of high real  short-term rates  holding up thereal yield curve  should begin to  show through to  spending that already  isbeing restrained by the higher dollar and weak income  abroad.  A policystance  that keeps real rates  relatively  high would seem  appropriate  when,  asnow,  the economy appears  to be beyond its  sustainable  level  of production.That rate  setting  helps to drag the  economy back toward its potential--theresult that is in  the staff forecast.A symmetrical directive  would not seem unreasonable  or come  as  a greatsurprise  to financial  market participants.  The term structure  of interest ratessuggests that investors  do not see the  risks as tilted toward greater inflationand tighter policy, even making  allowance  for the  effects  on  that structure  ofthe flight  to quality.  Indeed, a growing  number of observers  seem to betaking seriously the possibility that the next action  may be toward ease.Finally, even  if the Committee  views inflation  risks as  still substantial,  itpossible tightening, both because  greater fragility in markets  is likely topersist for a while and because price pressures  should be quiescent for alonger period.  If tilts  in the directive  are  interpreted  as having  a timedimension  as  well as connoting  the  likely direction  of the next policy action,a symmetrical  directive may better represent the Committee's intentions.Until  a few  years  ago,  tilts applied to possible policy actions  in the very nearterm--that  is, over the  intermeeting  period.  While the Committee  has notemphasized this interpretation  in  recent years,  it still  has seemed often  to beusing tilts to  signal that risks were sufficiently  skewed to make  a policyadjustment in the indicated direction  a distinct possibility over the nextseveral meetings,  and not just a  statement  of probabilities  in the  indefinitefuture.Still,  Committee  members  have been  projecting more inflation  than hasthe  staff, and  the Committee  may see the  risks of higher inflation  as  largeenough  and immediate enough  to justify retaining the  asymmetric  directive.inflation  concerns,  but perhaps  not by enough to change  the  directive.  Thefundamental  situation of the economy has not changed.  Economic  activity8/18/98remains  at a  level well  beyond most estimates  of the economy's sustainablepotential.  That overshoot  continues to be reflected  in the labor markets,where  increases  in compensation  remain  on an  upward trend.  And, recentprofit results  may in part suggest that the reservoir  of productivity-enhancinginvestments  that could offset the effects of higher  compensation  on costs  andprices  is not  bottomless.In addition, the moderation  in the growth  of domestic  final  demand soessential  to relieve pressures  on labor markets  is still  mainly a forecast.Although  markets  don't see  an eventual  tightening of monetary  policy asnecessary  for that moderation,  on balance outside economists  still  do.  Asrecently  as last week, the survey of economists  of primary  dealers  showedthat a considerable  plurality expected  your next action  to be a firming ratherthan  an easing.  And, as Mike  discussed, private  forecasters included in theBlue Chip survey  on average continue to expect an appreciable  pickup ininflation next year.The Committee  thus  would have reasons  for retaining a view  thatinflation remains  the principal  threat over time to sustaining the economicexpansion.  If so, before shifting its directive  stance, the Committee maywant to see further evidence  that the risk of higher  inflation has indeedreceded--for  example, data pointing more clearly to a slowing  in domesticfinal  demand.  In these  circumstances,  the Committee might be concernedthat returning  to symmetry  and then perhaps  needing  to shift back toasymmetry  a few meetings  later could be interpreted  as implying moresensitivity to very recent developments  and less regard for the underlyingfundamentals  and long-run goals  of policy than in  fact  characterizes  theCommittee's policy strategy.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions  for Don?  If not, let  me proceed.  Ido not have very much  to add to what has been discussed  around the table this  morning.  I  am inthe group that  sees no evidence  yet that  economic  and financial conditions  are  stabilizing in Asia.Indeed, many of you have noted that conditions  there continue to deteriorate.One of the problems  that concern  me  about stabilization  in Asia and perhaps  other areasof the world is  that the flexibility  required for adjustments is inhibited to  a very substantial  extentby worker unrest.  I am  speaking mainly about Korea, but other areas are affected  as well.  Moregenerally, the political problems  around the world clearly restrict the ability of governments  to8/18/98make  the  adjustments  that we would consider necessary  in these  types of crises.  Russia is theclassic  case.  It  is clearly the  case throughout  Asia as  well, even  in Korea where  one wouldassume that President  Kim has fairly  strong support.  In fact,Japan  remains the  most difficult  area  and the greatest  concern.  I don't have much  toadd to what has been  said, but it is obvious that the situation in Japan is deteriorating.  There is noevidence of stabilization.  The notion  that the Japanese economy  will bottom  out in the  earlymonths of next year is a very interesting  thought for which I find the evidence  quite lacking,  to saythe  least.  I think deflationary pressures  are rising  around the  world.  That fact is very difficult toavoid recognizing.  There  are fewer  and fewer areas that  are not touched by deflationarydevelopments.  Even  Canada, which seemed to be  such  a bulwark, is  obviously in  some difficultywith respect to its exchange rate that in turn is a function  of commodity price pressures  from Asiaas  well as  oil price  declines.  Europe  is doing  well,  but it is  not self-evident to me that there is anyacceleration  there.  Very fortunately for the introduction  of the  single currency,  Europe is in  asituation  in which the  ERM has  turned out to be  a vehicle  that is going to ease  them into the eurowithout any  obvious  adverse  difficulty, and this is not something I would have forecast two yearsago.  But it is hard  to argue  that Europe  is exhibiting the  considerable  economic  strength  that isstill obvious  in the United States.One  of the  problems I have  currently with our statistical  system is that I  am havinggreat difficulty  figuring out what is going on in  certain  very crucial  areas.  The most perplexing  isturning out to be in the labor statistics  area.  We are  seeing  a widening divergence  in  the8/18/98employment  data  as measured by the  payroll and the  household surveys.  I don't know  the extentto which  the problem is  a  short-term phenomenon,  but the numbers  are really interesting.  Thebest way to  describe them to you is  by citing the fact that  over the past year payroll  employmenthas gone  up by 3  million while household employment  adjusted to payroll  survey concepts--thatis, by taking account of agricultural  workers,  the self-employed,  unpaid family workers, unpaidabsences,  multiple job holders,  and  a few other minor categories--has  gone  up only  1 million.Hence, the statistical  discrepancy  has widened  by almost 2 million.  The same pattern  exists to aneven greater extent in the past six months.  In this period,  payroll  employment has risen  1.2million and the adjusted  household figure  has declined  600,000--a  difference  of 3.6  million at anannual  rate.  A small  part of the larger discrepancy  apparently  relates to underestimates of illegalimmigration,  which bias  down the population data and, therefore, the household  data.  There  aresome  other small technical  issues in both the payroll  and the household  data  whose resolutionwould tend to reduce that discrepancy,  but only marginally.We have been  accustomed  to looking with some  skepticism at the monthly changes inthe household  data because  of the characteristics  of a limited 60,000 household sample.  But forsix-month changes,  the standard  error of the estimates falls quite dramatically,  and it is  verydifficult to dismiss these  household data for sampling  variation reasons.  As  a  consequence,  weare  looking at an extraordinarily  difficult problem.  You may recall that up  until the  last six ornine months, the evidence  had indicated  that both payroll  and household  employment weregrowing  at a 2 percent annual  rate whereas  the  working  age population  including immigration  wasgoing up only  1 percent.  Over the past year, the  adjusted household  data have now  also risen  1percent and the unadjusted household data  have gone  up somewhat more  than  1 percent but8/18/98The serious  question  that we  have  at this  stage  is how  significant the tightening in thelabor market  has been  over the  last  six months and  the last year.  Certainly over the last sixmonths, the number of unemployed  people  plus those  who  are not  in the  labor force  but  want ajob has not changed.  To be  sure, that number has  stabilized at  a level that still  implies a  very tightlabor market, but  one that is not tightening  further.  This story, as you  are  well  aware, is quitedifferent from the  one we  get by merely looking  at  the payroll  data, which  still show  a relativelystrong month-by-month  growth pattern.  Something is different  here.  We  do not know  what it is.It unfortunately  turns out to be  in a  very crucial  area for the analysis  of what is going  on in thelabor market.As  some of you have  indicated,  we are  not even  quite sure  what the inflation  rate is.Until  1995,  the inflation rate,  if we  wished  to measure consumer price inflation,  was  evidentlyfairly close to  the core  CPI and core PCE rates,  which  did not  diverge  greatly.  Since then, evenwithout the methodological  adjustments  affecting the CPI core, the  gap  in the  two rates  ofinflation  has opened up.  We are now  dealing,  for example, with  a  12-month  change  in the  PCEcore deflator that in June  was  about  a full percentage  point less than  the CPI core.  So,  at a crucialnexus in our efforts  to  make judgments  about the inflation  process, our data have  deserted us, if Iis happening.To make matters  worse,  when we look at the productivity data, it clearly makes  a bigdifference  whether  we measure  output  on the basis  of the product  side of the national accounts  oron the  income side in  light of the continued widening  of the  statistical  discrepancy.  Thediscrepancy reflects  itself quite measurably in  the analysis of unit  costs and prices.  When  we lookat  productivity measured  from the  income  side--which  we used to do in  the BLS  data and we are8/18/98effectively  required  to do in the  nonfinancial  corporate  data--we  see that productivity  growthcontinues  to be quite strong and  total unit cost increases  are still quite  subdued.  However, as theexpansion  slows,  the labor markets  appear to be  sufficiently tight so that individual employers  arequite reluctant  to  lay people  off.  As  a consequence,  increases  in measured  productivity  slowdown of necessity.  This is another way of saying  that the unemployment  rate is a laggingindicator.In any  event, we are  at a point where  a critical  evaluation  is required for us tounderstand  the inflation process.  I still  think that most of the evidence, irrespective  of the data weare looking at, clearly shows that inflation  is low,  labor markets  are  tight, and compensation  perhour is  accelerating.  The productivity  data, as measured  on both the product  and the  incomesides,  are reflected in muted increases  in unit labor costs that coupled  with the decline  in unitnon-labor  costs result in a still  benign inflation process.  But our evaluation  would be a lot moreconvincing if we had a set of data that  were internally consistent and did not leave  us with  verylarge,  yawning gaps  in  significant places  in the  statistics.Despite  all these  data problems, however,  I believe that conditions have not changedenough to  suggest  that we alter  our evaluations  of the policy choices,  for example  those that DonKohn laid out for us to consider.  In my view,  the bottom line at this stage  is that the anecdotaldata and either version  of the other data that I discussed clearly  suggest that  "B", meaning  "nochange"  in the rate  structure, is the  appropriate position at  this stage.  But I must  say that this  doesleave  open  the question that  many of you have raised of whether  we ought to shift from ourasymmetric  stance back to symmetry.  Don Kohn has outlined  the arguments pro  and con.  I mustsay that I do not have a strong  view one  way or the  other.  I sense, but I cannot be  certain,  that the8/18/98Committee  is  moving from asymmetry  back to  symmetry.  It would be useful  if each membermade explicit  in  the go-around  where  he or she stands  with respect  to that issue.  Vice  Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I think your analysiswas exactly right in regard to  where we should be with the  federal  funds  rate, that is, alternative  B.I very strongly prefer  that we move to a  symmetric directive  for reasons  that I stated earlier andthat were  expressed by most of the people  in the  go-around.  Risks have  increased on both  sides,but they are very well  balanced in my view.  As of today,  I see no likelihood  whatsoever that  wewould decide to move the  rate between  now and  the next meeting,  and I think our next rate moveis equally likely to be  up or down.  Whatever  one's theological  view  of how the Committeereaches  its decisions  on symmetry  or asymmetry,  one would conclude  that a symmetric  directivemost clearly  reflects the current thinking of the members.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  I agree, Mr. Chairman,  that a symmetric  directive makes  sense at thismoment.  Such  a  directive reflects my view  that we are  unlikely to change monetary policyanytime soon  and that, when  we do, we may move the fed funds rate up or down.  Now, I havebeen  wrong before.  We all have been  wrong before.  The only argument  that I see  for notchanging the tilt is the fact that it does not have much operational  significance  and moving itaround a lot risks our looking  a little  silly if we turn out to be  wrong about the balance  of risks.So, I could go along  with the strong  argument for leaving the  tilt where it is, but my preferencewould be to  adopt a symmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  First, I strongly  support yourrecommendation  for no change in  policy at this meeting,  but I want to focus  my attention  on the8/18/98issue of symmetry versus  asymmetry.  In  my view,  the very tight labor  markets  impose a  naturalasymmetry  to policy in relation  to growth prospects.  Specifically,  a  forecast of persistentabove-trend growth  would, I believe, justify a tighter policy, but a forecast  of modestlybelow-trend  growth would not immediately dictate an easier  policy.  Instead, such  a developmentwould help to unwind the very tight labor markets  and contribute to a  soft landing  with maximumsustainable  growth  and full employment.  This, I believe, is  the foundation  for the asymmetricbias toward tighter policy that we have  maintained  since  the March meeting.  I still believe  thatvery  tight labor markets  and likely growth  near or above trend  will ultimately dictate that the nextmove  for the funds rate  will  be up rather than down.  This balance  of risks is best conveyed  by thecurrent  tilt in policy.But there  is a second  asymmetry  in the outlook today.  This  asymmetry relates toprobable  outcomes  versus central  tendency forecasts for Japan  and emerging economies  in Asiaand elsewhere.  Relative to  such  a baseline  forecast,  there is in  my view  a considerably  greaterrisk of a much  worse outcome in  those economies  than there is of a much more benign  result.  Isee this downside risk of a worse  case  outcome in Asia, should it materialize, as likely to spread toother emerging  market economies  and constituting the most serious threat to the U.S.  and theglobal  economies.  Such a worse case outcome does not have the highest probability, but it is themost worrisome  possibility that  we face today.  On balance, therefore,  I think a symmetric postureis the best choice for now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I, too, am in agreement  with your recommendation  of alternative B.I have mixed feelings  about whether or not to change  the  symmetry of our directive  at thismeeting.  The reason is that I continue to believe  that our next move should be to raise the federal8/18/98funds rate, and I think we would be better off right now from the  point of view of speculation  infinancial  markets,  credit  markets,  and real  estate markets if we had moved to  a tighter policystance earlier.  However, there  are a lot of worrisome  downside risks right now coming from theexternal  sector of the economy.  There is a  sense of spreading fragility  abroad  and  a possibility ofa feedback to our own financial markets.  Given the  sense of caution that  I feel  to a  greater degreenow than I did at the  last meeting,  I think the need  for a move has been pushed off until we seewhat the impact of various evolving events  abroad  will be on our economy.  So, I can go alongwith what seems to be the consensus  so far that we move to an unbiased directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

MR. MCTEER.  I have  a  strong preference for symmetry for the reasons  already stated.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson.

[SECTION]

MR.  FERGUSON.  Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation  of alternative  B.  Ihave a mild preference for  symmetry.  With President Minehan,  I  still have  some concern aboutthe risks  of rising inflation, but I also  agree that the external  sector has become  more uncertain.  Isense that symmetry is the best way  to communicate  these concerns  taken together.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I  will  support alternative  B.  As I havesaid before, I would like to see us move to a regime  where we could move the funds rate moreoften--not randomly but more often.  [Laughter]  I don't think that would look silly or needs  tolook silly, and I will go back to my example  of using the gas pedal to control  the speed  of the car.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Except on  the highway?8/18/98

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  A highway  with  hills.  On  the  directive, if we cannot  move thefunds rate around, I would certainly  like to move  the symmetry clause  around.  I think  the risks  areroughly  symmetric  now,  so I would definitely  support going to  symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stem.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I, too, favor alternative B  and I also supportsymmetry.  I almost always  am in  favor of symmetry.  It has the  advantage  in this case of beingappropriate.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I also  support your recommendation  for "B."  I agree thatthe risks  are greater  than they were at the time of our previous  meeting,  and I think there has beensome shift toward  the downside.  So, I would favor moving toward symmetry.  I would  suggest,though, that  it is  a little unfortunate  that we will be releasing information  on Thursday  that is notgoing to be consistent with  this proposal.  I hope that  we will be  coming back to the discussion  ondisclosure with Don Kohn  at a  later point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.  Don has that  scheduled.  As you know,  we werecontemplating  doing it today.  We just could  not get the material  together  in time.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I know.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I support  your recommendation  for alternative  B.  Frankly,  I havemixed emotions  about the symmetry issue.  If I were  asked, I would probably retain theasymmetry  at this point, given the strong domestic  demand,  but I am very comfortable  withsymmetry as well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole.8/18/98

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I support alternative  B.  I also support  a  symmetrical  directive because  Ithink that the risks are  far more symmetrical  now than they have  been  during the previous  fewmonths since  I became  a member  of this Committee.  I would like to point  out that a  key featureof the policy regime in recent  years  is that the  market has moved rates and has  done a  lot of thestabilization  work for us  under conditions  where  the Fed has set the right long-run  environmentand the market has moved.  There currently is  plenty of room for the market to move rates  higher,and should incoming  data start to point in that direction, I would anticipate  that the market  wouldback  up quite a bit.  So, in that sense,  there  is plenty of room for a tightening policy to take placethrough the market.  In the  other direction,  there is not that much  room, although  a little,  for ratesto decline from where  they are now because  they are anchored  to  the current  fed funds rate.  Thatwould mean that if economic  conditions  were  to weaken  quite a bit as the data come  in overcoming weeks  and months,  we might be looking for policy easing  to follow  the market down asthat evidence  accumulates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I can certainly  accept your "no change"recommendation.  As far  as the  symmetries go, I can accept  symmetry  without great angst becauseI think there clearly is a strong case for it.  But I would prefer to stay with asymmetry because thebasic structure  of the risks that  we have been living with for some time is still intact  in my  view.There is  a case for reorienting  our directive  a little  by moving toward  symmetry,  but for meeconomic  conditions have  not yet  changed enough to  change the policy  stance.  To repeat, I cancertainly accept  symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.8/18/98

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  For what it's worth, during the break I  gotthe data used  by the  staff to calculate  the median  CPI.  It takes  us  a little longer to compute thisnumber  after we get the BLS  statistics.  The number for July is 3.0 percent.  For July-to-July,  it is2.8 percent.  I would take that as  the best estimate of what  to expect  in the next  12 months.  Whatis interesting  is that when we break it down,  we  take the  position  based on long historicalexperience  that in  the case  of a divergence,  the published CPI almost  always converges  to themedian.  A divergence  occurred  between October of last year and March  of this year when  thepublished CPI dropped to an annual  rate under  1 percent  and the  median  stayed  right at about  2.8percent.  During  the four months  since  March, the  published CPI has  come  back to an annual  rateof 2.4 percent.  So,  one can  look at that  and say that monetary policy  has eased  because the realfed funds rate has fallen in  the  last four months.  That  is consistent  with some other monetarystatistics and credit aggregates,  especially  the monetary  base, which  I pay a lot  of attention to.The  reason for not taking action  to restrain monetary  growth  at this  point would beeither the effects  of developments  in  Asia  and Russia, though  I am not sure how  to quantify that,or the argument that  some tightening  would  do harm to them  and therefore  we should refrain  fromtaking  action.  Well, I am really a believer in tough  love.  I remember all the periods in the  1980sof rolling  over repeatedly  the maturing debt of Argentina  and other countries  to give them time tobuild up the courage  to  fix their problems.  It really  was only when we cut them  off that thepolitical  dynamics within  those  countries  got to  the point  where they were  willing to dosomething.  When  I listen to the  discussion  about Asia around the table,  it seems to me thatpeople  are  saying that some  of these countries  are not yet in bad enough  shape  to  fix.  I do notknow how our  taking action for the purpose  of helping  them creates  the pressures  for them to helpthemselves.8/18/98The other argument on the  domestic side for not  doing anything  is the Greenbookforecast.  Don Kohn  and others have  talked about  a forecast  of slowing expansion  in  domesticdemand and related  slowing growth in money  and credit and so on.  It is a forecast.  On  that score,I am  reminded of century date  change problems  associated with the computer, whose  developmentowes much  to Marina  Whitman's  father, John  von Neumann,  who  was the architect  of the moderncomputer system.  I do not think we ought to blame him for the two-digit problem,  but he  diddevelop  the basic  architecture  that goes into modern computers.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I think we ought to blame  Alan  Greenspan!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I learned it from John  von Neumann!

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  The other thing on  which we  as  economists place more  emphasis  washis work  with Oskar  Morgenstern  on the calculus  of decisionmaking  using mathematicalformulations  of the minimax type.  This helps  us to identify which kinds of errors  we  are willingto make and which are the most difficult to correct.  In that  light, I still believe  that  the morecostly mistake to correct will be  the one that occurs if it turns out that excess demand  growth doesnot in fact  slow  down.  The analysis  so carefully  done and mathematically  developed  by vonNeumann  and Morgenstern  basically  says that we sometimes  should base decisions on somethingthat we not only do not believe  and definitely  do not want, but that is  still the  wisest course  ofaction.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I support your recommendation  for  "no change"  inpolicy.  On  the directive,  it is  a close call.  I think that  on balance  the risks are  still marginally  onthe upside.  So, I would have  a  slight preference  for an asymmetric  directive  but I can support asymmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  I prefer  alternative  B  as well.  I am at the same place  as GovernorKelley.  I have  a  slight preference for continuing the asymmetrical  directive,  at least  for a whilelonger.  It  seems to me that given the extraordinary  visibility and publicity of the Asian andRussian  problems, we  could give  too much weight  today to those issues before we have somegreater assurance  that domestic  final demand will  slow to a pace  that is  consistent with nodeterioration in inflation.  I also have  some  concern  about the confusing  signal effect  of ourdelayed announcement  of the symmetry in  the directive, and I would feel  more comfortable  withmoving  to a  symmetrical directive today if we were  on a regime of announcing  that decisionpromptly  after each meeting.  However, I do not feel  strongly about the  symmetry issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  First Vice President  Varvel.

[SECTION]

MR.  VARVEL.  We would  agree that the downside risks  have increased,  but we  stillbelieve that the upside  risks are  greater, given the strength  in domestic demand.  So, we wouldcontinue  to favor a  smaller increase  in the fed funds  rate sooner rather than  a larger increase thatcould well be needed  later.  There  obviously is  a lot of sentiment  for alternative  B  around  thetable.  Given  Committee  adoption  of that alternative, we  would favor a  continuation  of theasymmetric  tilt.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There  seems  to be a fairly large concentration  ofpreferences  around "B"  symmetric.  Would you read the appropriate  directive?8/18/98

In  the context  of the Committee's  long-run  objectives  for pricestability  and sustainable  economic growth, and giving careful consideration  to economic,financial,  and monetary  developments,  a slightly higher federal funds rate  or a slightly  lowerfederal  funds rate would be acceptable  in  the intermeeting  period.  The contemplated reserveconditions  are  expected  to be consistent  with moderate  growth in M2  and M3  over comingmonths."
