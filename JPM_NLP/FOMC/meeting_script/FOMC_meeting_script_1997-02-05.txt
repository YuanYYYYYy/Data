[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Peter, having been duly elected tooffice, you now have to work.  You are on.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  The next topic  on your agenda is the review  of theAuthorization  for Domestic  Open Market  Operations.  I do not have any changes  to request atthis time,  but I did want to use this occasion  to bring you up to date on three issues.The first is  a preview of coming  attractions.  Following the Committee's discussion intrying to articulate  a set of principles  that could  guide the  management of the SOMA portfolioand to develop  some concrete  alternative portfolio  structures  that illustrate different mechanisms2/4-5/97for implementing what we have  taken to be your consensus  objective.  So, we continue to workon that, and  at some point in the future we will be bringing that back  to the Committee.The second topic  is an  elaboration that  I would like to make  on an  answer that I madelast September in response to a question from President Melzer.  He asked  me how differentportfolio  structures  might affect the securities lending program that we  are authorized  toimplement to assist the dealers.  In September,  I expressed  some discomfort with the currentprogram.  I would like to explain that a little and explain  other work we are doing at the Desk.The current securities  lending program  was devised  in the  1960s  as a response to the back officecrisis.  It was premised, and continues to be premised,  on the  assumption that we lend  securities,but not to a dealer who is "short" securities.  The idea was that we  were providing securities tofacilitate  the paper clearing  process, and in the event that a dealer was going to have a fail,  wewould be providing the securities  and thereby averting  that fail.  Well, we have had a book entryenvironment  for some time now, and it has never been  entirely clear to me how our lendingprogram really  fits in a book entry environment where a dealer often will not know if he is short,in the sense of a cash position to settle, until after the wire is closed.  In that case,  it is too late forus to lend him a security.  I have some sense,  perhaps  more than  a sense, that when  dealers docall and ask us to lend them securities,  some  seem to have forgotten  the requirement  that theyshould not borrow to cover a short position.  They know they  have to affirm  that they are notshort the issue in question, but I have some reason  to doubt the veracity of statements, based onmy consultations  with senior management at dealer firms.I think we ought to have a securities lending program of some kind, and I think theTreasury depends  on it to a certain  extent as a backstop to provide  some  elasticity in the supplyof securities  in the government  securities market.  However,  we do not want to be the  first-stop2/4-5/97shopping source for securities lending because  that would mean that we would destroy the wholesecurities-lending  industry,  given the  size of the SOMA portfolio.  We are  in the process  of areview.  We  are trying to start from first principles but on the assumption that we will have aprogram.  I believe an  appropriate  program  would be consistent with the Treasury's  wishes,  withour joint concerns  for the efficient functioning of the  government  securities market,  and with ourmentioning this to you now because  I would like to  invite suggestions from the dealers.  I amgoing to ask them what they think.  Some  of them have raised the subject with me.  I want toopen it up a bit and let all the dealers know that we are rethinking  the securities lending  programand that we would be open to their ideas about how we could structure it given our objectives.  Iwanted  you to hear about that from me before you heard about it from them.  I will come back toyou and let you know once  we have  a concrete  plan.  That is the second topic.The third is to bring you up to date  on our discussions with other central  banks aboutliquidity assistance,  something  we have talked about here from time to time.  As  the Committeeknows, we have  put aside for the time being any  work on a program that would involve  the Deskin doing reverse RPs for the SOMA account  with foreign central banks  that are in need oftemporary liquidity.  As the Committee  and the Board  know, we received  an inquiry fromabout our willingness to act as agent, not for the SOMA account,for a multilateral  repo facility.  It relates to a rather complex policy of cooperation  amongThe matter is not moving forward  with great  speed, but we haveresponded.  We are posturing ourselves  in a helpful but not pushy way and  are leaving ourpositive reaction on the table.2/4-5/97We are  now considering  the idea of the Desk acting  as agent with the Street forindividual central banks,  much as we did earlier in this  decade for authorities.  That is,had a portfolio of government securities  at the New York Bank and the Desk repoedthem out to the Street, providing with liquidity.  We  conducted those transactions  asagent for an undisclosed principal.  We  are considering  a similar function  as the pass-throughagent particularly for the authority  and the Isuspect that the also may be interested  in that approach.Those  are the three  works in progress,  if you will,  on which I wanted to update theCommittee.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions for Peter?  If not, wouldsomebody  like to move a renewal  of the Authorization  for Domestic  Open Market  Operations?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Ted Truman  has circulated  amemorandum  to which he attached  the text of the Foreign Currency instruments--theAuthorization,  Directive,  and Procedural  Instructions.  He proposes that they be renewed in theircurrent form for the coming year.  He  also suggests in his memorandum  that the current $20billion warehousing  agreement with the Treasury  revert to the $5  billion level that existed  forsome years prior to the increase  associated  with the now-terminated  Mexican  assistanceprogram.  In keeping with past practices,  you might recall  that we vote separately  on the  foreigncurrency  instruments  and on the  warehousing  agreement.  Before we  do so, I would like to knowwhether  anybody has any questions  they wish to raise  with Ted.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  A point of clarification,  Mr. Chairman.  The authority for thewarehousing  is in the first vote, right?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Yes, the authority to enter into a warehousing  transaction  is in thefirst vote.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is that satisfactory  to everybody?  Would somebodylike to move the first vote on the warehousing transaction  agreement?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Mr. Chairman,  President Minehan has  a question.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Just one small  question:  When we ratcheted up the amount  of thewarehousing  authority in the late  1980s, what was  the proximate  cause for that?  The  Bradypolicy?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That was a period  when  we and the Treasury  were  doing quite a lotof intervention in  the markets.  The Treasury essentially  ran out of dollars in the ExchangeStabilization  Fund.  We warehoused  some of their foreign  currencies  to provide them withdollars  so that they could participate with  us in foreign  exchange operations.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Would somebody  like to move the  warehousingagreement?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I move the warehousing agreement,  Mr.Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Seconded?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Second.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  The next item on  the agenda isboilerplate;  it is the report  of examination  of the  System Open Market  Account--

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I apologize  for interrupting.  My views  on foreignexchange intervention  are well known here, and I will not rehash them.  I would like to vote  "no"on the question  of renewing the Foreign Currency  Authorization  and the Foreign CurrencyDirective.  I thought we  were going to have two  votes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Didn't I call for that vote, or did I miss it?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  You went immediately  to the warehousing issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Sorry about that;  I got distracted.  Let us go back andstart from scratch.  On  the first vote, would somebody like  to move the renewal  of the ForeignCurrency  Authorization,  Directive,  and Procedural  Instructions?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So move.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It has been  moved and seconded.  All in  favor say"Aye."

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Aye.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All opposed  say "No."

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  No.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The  "ayes" have  it.  On the warehousing  agreement--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Approval  has been moved;  is it seconded?

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  All in favor say "Aye."2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Aye.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  "No?"  The  "ayes" have it unanimously.As  I said, the  next item on the agenda is the report of the examination  of the SystemAccount.  This report is considered  each  year on an  irregular schedule  that relates to the variabledate of the New York Bank examination.  Would  somebody like to move acceptance?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Second?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.The next item is  a memorandum  that came  out in  the last  few days  on the Program forSecurity  of FOMC Information.  Again, this is boilerplate.  Does anybody have any questionsthey wish to direct to Don Kohn or anyone else?  If not, would  somebody like to move  approval?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Approval  has been moved.  Is it seconded?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.President McDonough  has raised an  issue in a  letter he  sent me about the schedule forreleasing the minutes.  I thought I might turn the issue  over to him to present.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We  now follow  thepractice of releasing the minutes of our meetings on the Friday afternoon following the nextmeeting.  So, the minutes for the December meeting  are  scheduled to be released this comingFriday.  The effect  of that  is that the press report on  the minutes disappears  into a squib in TheNew York Times on  Saturday.  That is not a very widely read edition of The New York Times;2/4-5/97in fact, it is the least widely read of the week.  By the time newspapers  like  The Wall StreetJournal  arrive on Monday, the  minutes  are old news.  Frequently,  they are not picked up at all orin a very rudimentary  way.  That is unfortunate because  in the course of the  last several  years,the minutes have become  a quite  accurate  and revealing  indication  of what actually  happened atthe meeting.  They  are, I think, a very important part of the increased  transparency  that theCommittee is seeking to establish.  Therefore,  I think it is unfortunate  that  we continue to  adhereto this release schedule because  of past practice, though nobody can  quite remember  exactly  whywe started releasing  the minutes  on Friday afternoon.  So long as we  continue this practice,  wewill have  a very important contribution  to our transparency  effort disappear into the weekend.We  actually have ten releases  a year--the  Chairman's  two Humphrey-Hawkins  testimonies andthe eight releases  of minutes--in  which the Federal  Open Market Committee  is telling theAmerican people what we  are trying to  do.  I believe  that greater exposure to the minutes isdesirable,  and that could be achieved by moving up the time of the release.  Apparently,  the viewheld by Joe Coyne and others  is that Thursday  would be a day that we could  use.  That  would getthe Friday press,  which is better than having less  visibility than I believe  is desirable.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  That seems like an  excellent idea to me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There is one  technical problem relating  to the timing.  Iwould like to turn to Don Kohn merely to raise  the  question.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think Thursday resolves  our problem.  Sometimes,  as happened  whenPresident Moskow raised a question at the last meeting, it takes a while to revise the  minutes,reproduce them, and then get the  copies out to the Reserve  Banks  so that they are  available forrelease.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  A Thursday  release  would get the press reports  into theFriday morning  papers?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  That is right.  My letter suggested  a Wednesdayrelease or a Thursday release after  a two-day  meeting.  If we make it consistently Thursday, thatis actually  an improvement on my proposal.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Particularly  since the minutes  are approved at the beginning  of theTuesday-Wednesday  meetings, then presumably any problems would be cleared up on Tuesday,so a Thursday release  would work.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I thought it was a very useful idea.  Does anybodyhave any  further questions  or comments?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think it is a good idea.  I am sympathetic  to it.  Just a couple ofthings occurred  to me, and I would be interested in either your reaction  or Joe Coyne's  reaction.One  is that while The  Wall  Street Journal  and The New York Times will likely get the  storyreasonably  straight,  are not some other newspapers  and  television  networks likely to get mixedup and indicate  that the minutes  refer to the meeting that was just concluded one  or two daysearlier rather than to the meeting held some  six weeks  earlier?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  My feeling is that any news media that cantmake that distinction  will find the minutes so uninteresting  that they probably will not carry  areport on them.  Those that do understand the difference are  the ones that are interested enoughto publish  a report.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think doing it on Thursday  rather than Wednesday  probably helpsthat, too.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Yes.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions on Vice Chairman  McDonough'sproposal?  Are there  any objections to this change in procedure?  I will assume then that theCommittee  will accept the change in procedure,  and we will proceed  on your recommendation.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  In this regard, would somebody like to move approvalof the minutes  of December  17?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So move.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Excuse me,  Alan.  When would we release  those?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thursday  afternoon.

[SECTION]

MR.  MELZER.  We will go ahead  with the new schedule for these minutes?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do we release  them at 4:00 p.m.?

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  4:30 p.m.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  A question  about the timing:  If you release the  minutes  at 4:30 inthe afternoon,  isn't that awfully late for the  next day's  newspapers.  Don't you want to releasethem earlier in the day?

[SECTION]

MR.  COYNE.  Our current practice is to release  them at 4:30 p.m. on  a Friday.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  For the Saturday papers.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Right, but if we are trying to get more exposure  to the minutes  as adocument to explain  our policy,  wouldn't it be better to release them earlier if we could?2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  If I could  ask, Mr. Chairman--Joe,  we couldcertainly move the release time to 4:00 p.m. when  the stock market closes.

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  Yes, we could.  Some options markets  stay open beyond 4:00 p.m.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Maybe we could consult on the timing.  The other  issue, Mr. Chairman,is that domestic  market participants  sometimes  complain  when we release things  at the end of theday, particularly on  a day when  the Japanese  markets  are  opening for the  next day's trading inJapan.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Are  you suggesting  that it would be  better to release theminutes at 2:00 p.m. so that there is time for trading on the  information in our markets?  Let meask you this:  Can we leave  the decision to Messrs.  Kohn and  Coyne to come up between themwith an optimal conclusion?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Consulting with Mr. Fisher.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That will  slow you down a bit! [Laughter]  PresidentMinehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I know we have decided this issue, and I do not mean  to sayanything to change the decision.  I had some  misgivings, and they have just been  heightened bythis conversation.  I think there  is a distinction to be drawn between  transparency and  seekingmedia coverage,  and I am wondering whether our discussion  of these timing  questions may notlead to some confusion  of the two.  It seems  to me that  we are being transparent  by releasing  theminutes  and having them available  and  doing them the way we do  them.  I am a little nervousabout going the extra mile to seek the media coverage.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me  defend the Vice Chair's position on this becauseI would generally  agree  with you  on this particular issue.  The purpose of moving the release2/4-5/97forward, as  I understand  the Vice  Chairman, is to give more emphasis  to a key policy report thatwe prepare  in  a less-than-opaque  manner.  We do not have  that many releases  relating to ourpolicy decisions because  if we tried to do very many more, I think we would very significantlyrestrict the functioning  of this Committee.  The presumption  of a very significant portion  of theCongress  is that we release  nothing.  As  a consequence,  to the extent that we make  it clear thatwe do release  things, I think it probably is  a plus rather  than a minus.  I would restrict thatcomment to the official issuances of this Committee with respect  to monetary policy.  I wouldnot wish to go beyond that.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Nor would  I.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I just wanted to register a degree of nervousness.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It is a valid issue.  If we were to start to try tomanipulate  the press, we would lose and so would the System.  Let us move to the Deskoperations.  Mr. Fisher.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions for Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I have a question, Mr. Chairman.  The operating balances  that thecommercial  banking system holds  at the Fed have been  declining.  When  in your judgment  dowe start to get into a range where those reduced  balances  will materially  affect  your operations?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I remain  an  optimist that it is not the level but the rate  of change  that isimportant.  I am sure  there is some single-digit number that would have  a material effect  on ourbehavior--whether  it is as low as  1 or 0, I am not  sure.  But as long as we have  a gradual  movefrom the current level  down toward  10,  as we have  had in the last couple  of years,  I am not sure2/4-5/97there  is any magic point in that range at which  our operations will be impaired.  My hypothesisthat that is the case is progressively  being confirmed.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Just to follow up  on that  question, Peter, we have not made such aGiven that the  banking industry has demonstrated  its ability to operate effectively  with smallerand  smaller  amounts  of reserves,  do you have  any thoughts as to whether a change  in reserveconditions  would have any impact in terms of what you would have to  do in the reserve marketsto achieve  a given  federal funds  rate effect?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't have any  concrete  sense there  would be anything  different inwhat we would  do every day.  Maybe we would have to intervene  a little more than we docurrently.  A development  that could become  problematic,  I am hypothesizing,  would occur if acritical mass of the major banks in the country  were all to become unbound.  That is, they wouldmeet  their required needs  with just vault cash.  If every one of these banks were  over the  otherside, we might have  a very interesting federal  funds  market.  But I remain an optimist inbelieving that  some banks are  still going to be operating in the funds market, even if it is  thesmaller banks, and that their behavior, if all this  continues to happen gradually, would adjust tothe new conditions  and clearing would take  place.  All  of us around  the table know  that we  donot need required reserves  to conduct  our business.  We can run the banking  system on a biggerdeficit  or just up to zero or we can be filling in with temporary operations.  The tools are  veryflexible.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Of course,  even if banks do not need  any required reserve balances  atthe Reserve  Banks at the  end of the day, they need clearing balances  through the  day and at theend of the day.  So, even if every bank in the system were  unbound, I think there would be a2/4-5/97demand for balances  at the Federal Reserve,  and we  would be able to implement monetarypolicy.  I suspect  there might be a critical level,  Peter.  I think the rate of change  is important.We have been pleasantly  surprised that, with this gradual  rate of change,  the banks have adapted.My guess is  that they will continue to adapt,  as Peter says, as long as the rate of change is  low.But there might be some  level at which the clearing needs are  the operative  needs rather than thereserve needs.  Clearing needs  vary a lot from day to day.  Peter  will still be  able to get the rightaverage funds rate  over a period  of time, but there might be more  volatility.  We just do notknow where that point is.  I think it is lower than some might  have suspected  it was, based onpast experience.  It may be considerably  lower than its present range in terms of inducing  morevolatility.  But I think even if no bank is bound, there  still will be  a demand for balances  at theFederal Reserve.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I do not doubt that.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  And still  something for Peter to operate on in carrying out theCommittee's  policies.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  As balances  have gone down,  has anything  happened with  daylightoverdrafts?  Is  there any  pattern in what we  are  observing?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I don't think so.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I agree with Don.  I generally think of the cause-effect  as running theother way.  We had the change  in behavior in daylight overdrafts when  our policy changes  wereimplemented  five or six years  ago,  and we are  now seeing the pass-through.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions?  If not, would somebody like tomove to ratify the operations  of the Domestic Desk?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So move.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  We also need to approve  theincreased intermeeting  leeway for Peter.  Would  somebody like to move that?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Move approval  of $12  billion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is there a second?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Let us move on to Messrs.  Prell andTruman.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is  about as  good a "Chart Show"  as the staff haspresented  to this Committee in quite a long time.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  It was very interesting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Very, very informative.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Ted suggests it is because  we set a low standard  previously.  [Laughter]But I will try to take it more positively.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I am sorry you  raised the hurdle; that will require  morework in the future.  Questions  for either gentleman?  Yes, President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  When you started off, Mike, I think I heard you say that the actualfourth-quarter  data published after the Greenbook was completed  had not changed the profile  ofyour forecast from what you had in the Greenbook.  What about the risk to that forecast andspecifically  the upside risk to which you gave  some attention  in the Greenbook?  What  motivatesmy question  is that, if I remember your presentation  correctly,  when  you compared theGreenbook projections  with the actual  fourth-quarter  numbers,  you referred to the unexpected2/4-5/97strength of net exports, which clearly may prove  to be  temporary.  But I believe  you  alsoindicated  that a number of final demand  categories  were stronger than your projection,  includingconsumer  spending on durable goods,  business fixed investment, and  I think housing as well.Does that unanticipated  demand late last year give  you a sense that there may be moreunderlying  momentum in the expansion and that the upside  risks may be a little higher than  youhad in mind before  the fourth-quarter  GDP data came  in?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Perhaps,  but not so much that I felt the need to feature that aspect of thepicture.  There are  some sectors where historically  one would look for positive  serial correlation.The fact that  consumption was  as strong as it was according to the published numbers,  thoughonly a little stronger than we  had forecast,  might lead us on the basis of historical  experience  toanticipate ongoing strength to some degree.  On  the other hand, the personal  saving rate waslower than we  had forecast.  On still another  hand, the fourth-quarter  outcome may be a sign thatthe wealth effect is beginning to show through more  importantly and that  one of the upside risksthat we have noted for some  time now is coming more into play than we sensed in the fourthquarter.  Those durable goods  categories  may be a place  where that would occur.In the  area of business fixed investment,  nonresidential  structures  were  stronger.  Infact, our reading  of the construction  put-in-place data for December released just yesterdaysuggests that  there might even be  a slight upward revision in  that number for the fourth quarter.However,  I am not inclined to view that report as  a sign of even  greater  strength going forward.In fact, the spike in such construction was  so sharp that there  probably will be a slight tendencyfor it to drop off in the  near term, at least in growth rate terms.In the residential  construction  area, we made a very  substantial  error.  That was anerror that we should not have made  in our translation  of housing  starts into  residential2/4-5/97investment.  We did not anticipate  that the estimates of housing starts  and residential  investmentwould be brought back into line  as quickly  as they were.  We think that, going forward, thechanges  in residential  investment that we have been  anticipating remain reasonable.  The data onnew home sales that we got today still look about the  same as in November;  they seem toconfirm our notion that  housing activity has perhaps  stabilized at the about the level  we wereanticipating.  So, we would not have a new  view of the outlook for residential  investment.  Theother aspect of this is that, if we have  a level  adjustment  in GDP that does  imply more output.That might call for more  inputs and  a somewhat lower unemployment rate  than we have in ourforecast.  But the  difference here,  given  our interpretation  of the GDP  data, is so small that itreally is  not material  to the  outlook.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  I had  a question  that is  somewhat similar in terms of theimplications  of the fourth-quarter  number for, say,  1997.  At the  end of the fourth quarter,  theGDP gap was  obviously  a couple of tenths higher.  Are you saying that if you were to revise theGreenbook  forecast that the degree  of resource  utilization by the  end of, say,  1997,  would beroughly  what it is in the current forecast  or that the gap would be  larger roughly by an  amountequal to the difference  between the  fourth-quarter  Greenbook  forecast  and the  advance estimatefor the fourth quarter?  I am not quite sure of the answer.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  You will recall that we  learned nothing new  about the level  of resourceutilization  in the  fourth quarter  as measured by unemployment  or capacity utilization.  So, thereis  a question of alignment here.  In the fourth quarter, by Okun's law  equations, we found theunemployment rate to be a little higher than we might have expected,  given our GDP path.  Thisnew number suggests  an even greater excess.  We had been  anticipating  that we were  going to2/4-5/97catch up, with more of a drop in the near term than suggested  by the rule-of-thumb  applied to thequite modest increases  in output that we were forecasting  for the first part of this year.  Wewould just, I think, continue in that vein.  It would be,  in a sense,  a bigger catchup.  But anyadjustment we make would perhaps be on the order of .1 percent on the unemployment rate,  andit is  a tough call.  We would have to think about whether we would  want to alter productivityslightly from the higher level.  One has to consider other possibilities  as well.  I just do not thinkit is a material  difference as we are  interpreting  the data.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  On chart  3,  in the middle section that shows inflationand price-earnings  ratios,  I had not seen the information presented  quite like that before.  I amwondering  whether there are  enough observations  in each of these buckets  to get  a meaningfulaverage.  In addition,  I assume that the less-than-3-1/2  percent bucket includes  a lot of the earlieryears in the period.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Because  it is  such a long period, there  are  a lot of quarters  to put intothese buckets.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  So this is done on a quarterly  basis?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I cannot tell you how many quarters  there are in each of those inflationranges;  I probably should have  checked that.  In terms of the broad sweep, if you look at a chartof inflation versus the P-E ratios--all the noise in the  relationship makes  it a little hard to see--you can perceive  this correlation.  There  are reasons that are propounded  for why this patternmight occur.  There are differences  of opinion, but it's not difficult to come up with reasons thatmight lead one to believe that there is this kind of correlation.  Clearly, that is not the whole storyin assessing whether P-E ratios are  abnormally high, abnormally low,  or right on the  historical2/4-5/97norms.  One needs to think about the interest rates that are  prevailing at these times;  one  has tothink about the expected earnings  growth at these times.  Perhaps because  of the phase of thebusiness  cycle, and  apart from whatever  inflation might lead one  to think about the stability  ofthe outlook, other factors could affect what kind of risk premium one wants  for investing inequities  as opposed  to fixed income.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  The tabulation  was impressive,  and I guess I was  surprised that  therelationship is as consistent  as  is implied by this table.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  To  be fair, this table  is just a slight variation of the one Abby Cohen hasused.  As you know,  she has been  among the  most bullish and the most correct stock marketforecasters.  This is one of the  key exhibits  she presents  in support of her opinion.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stem.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Mike,  a couple  of technical  things:  The principal  surprise to me in thefourth-quarter  data was the employment cost index,  and I know you looked into that.  Myquestion  is whether you  are satisfied  with what you found out because there were  a couple ofcharacteristics  that looked a little out of line to me.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I can pick one that was widely discussed, namely the behavior of thenonproduction bonus component  of benefits.  It  struck many people  on Wall Street who werepocketing huge bonuses as out of keeping  with reality.  However, as best we can tell, this isprobably  at least in part a matter of timing.  If the bonuses were not paid by mid-December, theywill be picked up in the March  ECI.  It could be that these are errant numbers  reflecting justsome  sampling problems.  Conceivably, the  firms  with the big bonuses might not have been inthe sample.  So, there may still be  grounds  for residual doubt about the accuracy  there.  We have2/4-5/97not found any smoking guns that tell us that we  should look at these numbers  with a jaundicedeye.  They  are reasonably  credible,  I think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is  there evidence that the Wall Street bonuses  at the endof 1996 were significantly  greater  than the year before?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  That is what  I read in the newspapers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  What is the order of magnitude?  What informationhave you got?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  At some of the major firms the level wasapproximately  50 percent higher  in  1996 than in  1995.  The tax receipts  of New York City andNew  York State reflect this  boom as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  When do they usually pay the bonuses?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  The earliest  is December  and most of them arepaid out by the end of January.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Our supposition is that a lot of this discussion just did not recognize  thata good  share of the bonuses  will be paid out after December.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  So, the seasonal  adjustments do not capture thischange?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't know whether that timing is new, though  I think there has beensome  shifting over time.  In part, it is inconvenient  in terms of tax planning to get this  big slug ofmoney very late in the year.  But I think there  are other considerations,  too.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  My second question:  What is your estimate now for fourth-quarterproductivity?  Is it up  1-1/2 to 2 percent or something like that?2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  My recollection  is it that it is up 2-1/2 percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  2-1/2  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes.  That is based on  a reasonably firm view of what the nonfarmbusiness  output was for the quarter but only a tentative view  about what the total hours workedultimately will look like.  We think we have a reasonable  handle on it.  It will probably be in the2-1/2 percent  vicinity.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  What is the comparable compensation  per hour figure?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  It's 3-1/2 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mike or Ted, I have a question on your oil price comments.  I don'tdisagree  with your projection of a decline  in oil prices.  But I am hearing more  from individualsin the energy industry that, given their current outlook for world oil demand  and the limitedability of producers  to accommodate  that demand, they  are increasingly  of a mind that theseprices will stay higher longer.  As you judge this and from what  you hear,  do you have anyinclination  to move away from your baseline  projection  toward a higher price  scenario?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think there are two aspects  to your question.  One would relate tothe  short term, meaning  the period we  are looking  at here,  and the other  would be  a longer-termperspective.With regard  to our assessment of what the industry is saying about the short-termsupply  and demand balance  and abstracting  from accidents  of one  sort or another like coldweather in Europe, hurricanes,  and so forth, we  are in fact  quite conservative  in  our use ofconventional relationships  in terms of what the industry itself says about new production  comingon line over the next year or so.  That said, I think that for a medium-term  forecast going  out2/4-5/97beyond this period--and  leaving aside  the little run-ups that we have had--we might be moreinclined to shift from an almost flat nominal price trend, which implies a real  price decline, tosomething that might be  more flat  in real terms.  While there  is no inviolable  arithmetic  involvedhere,  I think almost everybody believes  that we have to get there ultimately.  That's because  of asense that some  of the technological  improvements  that have come  on line and other factors willcome into play to produce that result.  Now,  I say all that partly against the background  of anassumption that  Iraq will stay put.  If we assume that Iraq will reenter the market with 3  millionbarrels  a day or something like that, then we are  postponing that scenario  for 18  months  or acouple of years  before the extra supply is absorbed.  The one  negative on the other side is  that agood deal  of this new production is in parts of the world that are not the most stable;  oneexample  is Columbia.  So,  we might  have a lower level of prices  for a while, but a firmly higherlevel of volatility  as a result of interruptions of one  sort or another in the supply of oil.  That'sthe best I can do.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Okay.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I have a couple of questions, Mike,  following up on what PresidentStern was talking about in terms of productivity  assumptions.  You have a discussion  in theGreenbook  about a change  in your thinking about the trend rate in productivity  growth.  I wasinterested  first of all because it moved down rather  than upward,  and second  it would appear tohave  implications for potential output.  I wondered  what those implications were--they  areprobably part of your forecast--and  what your range of uncertainty is around that trend inproductivity  growth because it does  seem to have  an impact.  I don't disagree  at all with the2/4-5/97trend in your overall forecast.  I just wonder how those changes  came about  and whether they arereflective of something different in your thinking recently.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We aren't certain and  I don't see how anyone  really could be in thisarea.  We had clung  with great determination  to the assumption  that the underlying  growth trendin this decade  would prove to be  1.1  percent.  We have been continuing  to reassess  thisassumption,  and I guess particularly because  this meeting is  one of those  when a longer-runperspective may be important to the Committee's  deliberations,  we took another hard look at it.What we perceived  was that a trend line well below our  1.1  percent growth  assumption clearlywould fit in a more natural way what we had been experiencing up through at least the thirdquarter of last year.  The  historical pattern is that productivity  tends to be above  the trend in levelterms until almost the  end of an expansion,  if not all  the  way to the  end of the expansion, and itthen dips down below  trend during a recession  and the early recovery phase  and subsequentlymoves back up.  What we found is that, with  a  1.1  percent trend  line, we were well below thattrend line now and have been for a while  even though the expansion has not come to an end.That just did not fit.  Something like .7 percent  gave a picture  that looked more like the recenthistory.  Now, there may be reasons why earlier historical  patterns would not hold this time.  Theadjustments of labor to output in the short run may be different,  and so on.  But, when thedivergence persists  over several  years, that is  a troubling  pattern.We also noted that there were reasons to think that output, and thus productivity,  mayhave  been underestimated  over the last few years.  The question  is how much.  One could lookat the difference  between  gross domestic  income and  gross domestic product--a difference  thathas become quite sizable--and  conclude  that production  really has been much  stronger than thedata suggest and productivity greatly understated.  But looking at the history of revisions  and2/4-5/97what little we know about what might be the  flaws in the income-product data, we thought thatwas  a rather aggressive  assumption about what true output and  productivity had been.  So we in asense compromised.  We did assume that the trend in actual levels  of productivity has beenunderstated  in recent years, but only by enough for us to try to square things by assuming  about.9 percent trend  growth in productivity.  The fourth-quarter number actually is reasonably  helpfulin getting a picture that  looks sensible with that kind of trend line.  Now, this would naturallyfeed through  to our potential  output assumption, but there are offsetting considerations.  Whenwe looked at the trends  in the average  workweek  and the factors that get us from  nonfarmbusiness output  to GDP and so on, we were led to conclude that an estimate  of about  1.9 percentfor the period since  1990 still  looked pretty good.  So, we have  not changed our potential outputtrend; it is  still about  1.9 percent per year, chain-weighted  on  a 1992 base.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Just to follow up on  that:  The lower trend rate of productivitygrowth,  then, has been consistent in  your mind with where we  are on an unemployment  basis  andwhere we  are on  a change-in-inflation  basis.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That was another factor.  We looked at Okun's Law.  It has workedpretty well.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It does not in itself suggest that output growth has been a lot more rapidthan measured.  That also gives one pause because, while  Okun's Law is not a relationship  onecan depend on from quarter to quarter or even year to year, over extended periods  it works  prettywell.  So, that gave us some  pause as to whether we  should maintain  the seemingly optimisticview that the productivity trend was  1.1 percent.  Having to adjust that trend, we also adjusted2/4-5/97our sights on what actual  productivity growth would be over  1997-1998,  and that is how  weformulated  our forecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further  questions?  If not, let me raise the question  thatPresident Jordan raised in his letter to all of us with respect to our individual forecasts.  I alwaysthought  that the combination  of the central  tendency and the range was  an effective  way ofsummarizing  what everyone  has been trying to convey.  It is not clear  to me why that is not thecase,  and  I am just curious to know,  Jerry, what you think could be significantly  improved andwhat you think you can infer from the greater  detail.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  My emphasis was not so much on the  distribution, although  I wouldlike  to see the detailed  distribution of these forecasts because  I know that three on each  side gettossed out to arrive  at the central  tendency.  I  am more interested in the  multi-year aspect of ourefforts to  address our problem of distinguishing  between  a forecast of what is going  to happen  inthe near term and a public statement  about what our objectives  are.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN. I think that is an issue  that will be coming up later.  So,you are not focusing  on the question  of publishing more  detail than we do currently?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  No, I  am not worrying  about that.  More detail would not add muchto what we  already publish, though I don't know why we don't share  the detailed  distribution.  Idon't  care who makes  which forecast.  But I am interested in trying to evaluate  specific  forecastsin terms of what I think of as my version of the internal consistency  of a forecast.  It can tell me alittle about peoples'  thinking when I look at their forecasts of output, unemployment,  andinflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I'm not terribly  certain what you would  learn if youlooked at that.  The degrees  of freedom that exist in playing around with those numbers,  as  you2/4-5/97know better than anybody, are quite large.  Let me suggest this, rather than getting into  adiscussion  now, which I don't think we really need to do.  You all have  gotten Jerry's letter.  Ifyou will communicate  your views to Don Kohn,  perhaps we can get a sense as to whether  peoplethink there are  reasons to change what has been a long-standing practice.  Is that satisfactory,Jerry?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  That would be fine.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let us move  on to the Committee's  discussion.  Whowould like to start?  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Strong  growth has  continued in theTwelfth  District in recent months  and the base of the expansion is broadening.  The recent trendof growth has been robust in California  despite some lack of cooperation from Mother Nature.Severe flooding in northern  California destroyed  a large number of homes  and disrupted manybusinesses.  But the extent  of the recent losses is small  relative to overall  state income or to thelosses from some of the  other natural  disasters that have shaken the  state in recent years.Property damages  from the Loma Prieta  and Northridge earthquakes  were roughly  three to fivetimes the damages from this year's flooding.  I might note that the  damages from  our recentflooding in California  were about the same as those from last year's flooding.In our other most populous states, growth  has picked up a bit lately.  Employmentgrowth in Arizona and Oregon  is averaging  in the 4 to 5 percent range.  Job growth also  movedup to about 4  percent recently in Washington,  reflecting hiring by Boeing to ramp up itsproduction in an effort to work down  its huge backlog of domestic  and export  orders.  Severaltypes of nonresidential  building activity also have picked up recently  in the District, consistentwith the national  strength that we saw in this category in the fourth-quarter  GDP estimates.  For2/4-5/97example, we have  seen a large  recent pickup in  office  construction activity as the fundamentalsin that market have improved  considerably  in some of the District's fastest growing metropolitanareas.  Office  vacancy rates  are particularly  low in  Seattle and in  the San Francisco Bay Area.Turning  to the  national economy,  the stronger-than-expected  real  GDP growth late lastyear was related to an  apparently  temporary jump in exports.  That  suggests that we  should seemuch more moderate  growth this quarter.  Nonetheless,  last quarter's  surge still means that theeconomy  is operating at a higher level than seemed  likely last month.  This puts additionalupward pressure  on inflation.  The recent  rise in the  dollar and in long-term  interest rates mayslow the economy's  growth rate  later this year.  However, we still would expect  real GDP to riseat or slightly  above its trend  growth rate this year if the funds rate  were to remain at its presentlevel.With regard  to inflation, we expect the  CPI to  rise by a bit under 3 percent this year.For the longer term, however,  I continue to see a significant risk  of an increase  in underlyinginflation  over the years  ahead.  While judging resource  utilization  is difficult, the unemploymentand the capacity utilization rates taken  together suggest  that excess  demand pressures  arebuilding in  the economy.  Even  with a healthy dose  of skepticism about estimates  of resourceutilization, it appears  unlikely that  containing inflation,  let alone  reducing it which I certainlywould prefer,  will be forthcoming without a tighter monetary policy in the future.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  There are  a couple  of things that I want to talk about.One is a report  that the National Federation of Independent  Business  made two weeks  agocovering the end of last year and the beginning  of this year.  I thought there were  someinteresting  items in the report.  The percentage  of firms reporting higher prices plunged to record2/4-5/97lows, but plans to raise prices  in the next few months jumped to a 12-month  high.  Reports ofcompensation  increases reached  a new record  high.  Some 32 percent of the firms said  they hadraised compensation,  and that is 8 percentage  points higher than in any previous  report.  But onthe other side, plans to raise compensation  in  1997  fell significantly,  almost to a record low.Capital spending plans  remain strong.  The report  now says that 37  percent  of the respondentsare planning to increase  capital  outlays.  A record  76 percent of the firms reported actualincreases  in capital  expenditures  last year.Let me turn to developments  in my District.  First on the retail level,who is in retail distribution nationally,  and it is not always clear whether his remarksapply to regional  or to national developments.  He said that retail sales were  very good  inpercent  increase in  1996.  Whether  or not that rise can be justified in terms of greater efficiencyor what some might call productivity  was not clear from his comments.We  are now hearing from contacts in the construction  sector in the region that they areno longer expecting  some falloff in  1997 from  1996;  in fact, some concerns  are being registeredabout possible overbuilding  in the commercial  sector.  The claim being made is that what  isalready in the building pipeline to be completed this year, especially  retail space,  could result inoversupply.  Labor contacts  tell  us that labor negotiations  in the construction  industry  are goingto be tough this spring, meaning that they plan to catch up.  The view in the unions is that thecost of benefits  has been coming down in the last few  years and that the contractors  are  adding totheir incomes  as a result.  The workers  feel that they now deserve  larger wage increases  in thenext contract  than they received in the  last contract because  of what they see  as very  substantial2/4-5/97increases  in productivity  and efficiency in the construction trade.  They believe  they  are notbenefiting  from that improvement  and that now is  catch-up time.In the  steel sector, we are  hearing that  wages  are expected to be up about 3-1/2  percentthis year, and our contacts  say that such  an increase is in line with gains  in productivity.However, they think prices  are going to end the year lower than  where  they are currently and  that1997 prices will average below those  in 1996.  So, earnings  at best will be  flat and are  morelikely to be down.  Steel industry executives also  continue  to be concerned  about imports,especially because  of the appreciation of the dollar.  In our area we  are being told, mainly bysuppliers  of automotive  parts, that auto sales will be down this year from  1996.I thought one report on labor was of particular  interest.  There  are  70,000manufacturing  workers  in northeast  Ohio, and their average age is  in excess of 50 years.  One ofthe  large firms, a steel  company, put out a notice  that it wanted to hire  100 entry-level  productionworkers.  They stopped taking applications  after two days when they had received  1,500applications  for jobs with starting  wages of $38,000.  However,  they could not find  100 qualifiedworkers  out of these  1,500  applicants.  So, there is concern about the quality  of the work force.One note on the  housing market:  I don't know  how general this phenomenon  is  yet,but we are hearing reports that prices  of houses  on the high end of the scale are  softer and thatthese  houses  are staying on the market longer.Quite a few of us took a tour of facilities  so that we could report toDon Kohn on what is going on in The discussion focused  on the productivityand efficiency challenges is facing.  They claim  to be in the  midst of majorleaps in productivity due to new equipment  technologies.  The latter  are leading  to theintroduction  of new products  that are  substituting for products  previously made out of other2/4-5/97materials.  All this raises  some interesting issues.  The time for designing and testing a newproduct  a couple  of years  ago was measured in months.  It is now measured  in days, because  ofthe use of computer assisted  design equipment  and new testing procedures.  Computerizationalso has enabled to achieve  extraordinary  gains in efficiency by using productionequipment  that is fairly similar, or looks similar, to existing equipment.  As recently as  1995,  ittook them 8  hours on average to change  a mold.  This year  they are planning to do it in 45minutes.  They anticipate  machine  downtime  in  1997  to be  1/4 of what it was in  1995  and theirscrap  rate to be less than  1/2 of what it was  in  1995.  They  operate  on a rolling  3-year plan, andthey say that they currently expect a 3 percent per year increase  in their labor costs, but theiroutput prices  will fall  1 to 2 percent per year.  Their earnings are good  and they expect them tocontinue  to be good.  For  1997,  they indicate that their labor costs will  average about 5 percentof the  wholesale price of a product.  We looked at one product in particular--the--which  sells for about $10.00  at Wal-Mart.  Last year, they were  making 2 cans  in 35seconds  on one machine,  and the new equipment they are  installing now will make 4 cans  in 35seconds.  The wholesale  price will be $6.00, and there will be 30 cents of labor cost in the $6.00.I asked  them about the effects of NAFTA on their operations in Mexico.  Theysaid that NAFTA was  largely irrelevant  to their production there.  They noted that they havevirtually  no turnover  of labor in their operations.  All new hires start on thenight shift.  It takes approximately  30 years of seniority for a  worker to get moved to the dayshift. [Laughter]  In Mexico, on the other hand,  they are experiencing  25 percent turnover.  So,recruiting and training in Mexico are  huge costs to them.  They  say that in the end the differencein labor costs is about $2.00  an hour, but when the labor cost is only 30 cents per $6.00 trash can,it is irrelevant.  They say that labor could be  free in Guangdong province  and they still could not2/4-5/97make  such products there  and import them at a profit.  So they have crossed over a threshold inwhich the value  added coming  from labor  is so small because  of efficiencies in production  thatthey cannot afford to produce  at a remote  location and move the product around.  They have  tohave their manufacturing  facilities  close to their points  of distribution.  They  said their biggestchallenge is being able to respond when  they know every  single  day which of their products weresold and need to be ordered in each  and every  store of a Wal-Mart or some of the other chains.One more note on District manufacturing companies:  When they respond  to ourquestions  about inflation, they say they are experiencing  no inflationary  pressures even thoughtheir wages are  increasing  3 percent or so and their earnings  are very good.  Their earnings  weregood  last year  and are expected  to remain so in  1997.  So, their story provides  at least indirectevidence  that productivity  gains are quite high and are expected to be  quite high in anenvironment of very,  very low labor turnover.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall,  1996 was a very good year forthe Seventh  District.  For most of our key manufacturing  industries,  shipments exceeded  theirearly  1996 expectations  and housing activity  for the year as a whole was much stronger  thananticipated.  As we move into  1997, expectations  are that these sectors  will continue  to operate  atvery high levels, but perhaps  not quite  as high as last year.  Specifically, discussions with majorproducers in our District indicate  that most of them are expecting  1997 sales to post smalltools, appliances,  and steel.  A major exception  is the agricultural  equipment  industry,  whichanticipates  a better year than last year.  Most  of our key  industries are expecting  the first half of1997 to be stronger than the second half, and current  data and  anecdotal  reports  offer very few2/4-5/97signs that activity  has declined so far.  Manufacturing  activity in the District continued  to expandin early  1997,  as indicated  by the purchasing managers'  reports for Chicago,  Detroit, andMilwaukee.  There  has been some improvement  in the heavy truck industry as noted  in theGreenbook.In terms of consumer spending, January looks like a repeat  of December.  Theunderlying sales rate for light motor vehicles  in January  appears to have  continued at about thereasons.  Some foreign name plates reportedly are including some December sales  in theirstrengthening  of the dollar.  Reports from retailers have been  mixed but suggest on balance  thatretailers that  means that January was better than they expected,  similar to what Jerry Jordanmentioned.  Large District retailers  and discount  chains entered  1997  with lower inventorylevels than usual,  allowing  at least  some of them to avoid the  heavy discounting often  associatedwith January clearance  sales.Labor markets  in the District are  still very tight.  Unemployment rates in each of ourfive states continue  to be below the  national  average.  Although there still does not appear to be asignificant spillover into prices,  reports of increased  pressure on wages have become  morewidespread.  The head of a major temporary help firm indicated to me that he  definitely is seeingwage pressures.  He expects wages of temporary  workers  to increase an average  of 5 percent thisyear in contrast  to the 2 to 3 percent  gains last year and unchanged  wages in  1995.Turning to the national outlook,  in December my assessment  of 1996 was that GDPgrowth in the  second half had decelerated  from the  pace in the first half.  Even so, I expressed2/4-5/97concern  that output was  still  somewhat above potential  and, looking forward,  that higherinflation  rates were  a risk.  With the fourth-quarter  data now available, it appears  to me that therisks  are clearly on the upside and they seem higher now than they did in December.  By therules  of the game to date, this Committee has focused  most of its inflation attention  on the CPIand the core CPI and in the time that I have been  here a 3  percent inflation  rate was viewed asprogress toward  lower inflation.  With the recent  methodological  adjustments by BLS,  however,we need to recalibrate  that standard now to a lower number, probably about 2-1/2 percent.  Bythis standard the Greenbook outlook for core  CPI inflation in  1997  and  1998 has  deterioratedsubstantially  since last month.

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The burst of year-end  1996 economicactivity that shows up in the national  data and that people  have  already mentioned around  thetable is not reflected  in either the  most recent  data for our southeastern  region  or the  anecdotalreports that we are getting  from directors  and other people we talk to.  While we would  stillcharacterize  our regional  growth as  moderate, we  clearly are seeing some slowing from  the pacethat we saw earlier when our region led the nation  in job growth.In manufacturing,  I have  reported  at almost every meeting  on the weakness  and thesignificant loss of jobs in the textile  and apparel  industries, and that weakness  continues.  We arenow seeing weakness in  both pulp and paper.  And  as housing  construction  appears to havepeaked,  we also are seeing  some  slowing in the  production  of home-related  products  like lumber,carpets,  and appliances.  That in  fact is a cyclical development that we have come  to expectbecause  an important part of our manufacturing  sector feeds  off the national  housing industry.On  the other hand,  our relatively new  and quietly growing southern  auto industry is showing2/4-5/97some modest strength,  and the prospects  are for more of the same in the period  ahead.  Reportsof less robust capital spending plans by manufacturers  in our region  also suggest someIn construction, single-family  home sales  and construction  have both slowednoticeably in our region  and multifamily activity is now clearly past its peak.  Retail constructionalso has slowed.  At the  same time, commercial  construction remains  strong, particularly  that ofoffice  space where vacancy levels  have gotten quite  low.  We are  seeing some speculativebuilding  in Atlanta and some  other southern cities  but not yet at a worrisome level for a regionthat needs  space to accommodate  companies  moving into the area.Retailers,  who are coming off what they characterize  as generally satisfactoryyear-end  1996 sales,  are telling us that  they are comfortable  with their inventory levels and theiroutlook for sales in  1997.  The well-publicized  freeze of vegetables  in Florida was severe, theworst in seven years,  with most of the crops  damaged and losses around  the state  estimated at$250 million.  Crops like corn  and beans can  be recycled  in 45 to 60 days, but imports of foodfrom Mexico  and other Latin American  countries are reportedly taking up some of the slack.Finally, labor markets  remain tight in our region.  I would characterize  the  changesince our last meeting as indicating  somewhat less pressure  and somewhat fewer shortages  incertain  skills like those in construction,  but at the  same time new geographic  areas in the regionare reporting tightness.  Even with continuing  tightness, extraordinary  wage pressures  are stillisolated  and do not yet appear to be spreading.At the national level,  like almost everybody  else, we underestimated the strength ofthe economy in the fourth  quarter.  Like the  Greenbook  and others, we  anticipate more moderategrowth in  1997 and on into  1998.  We are among those who see somewhat  slower growth in2/4-5/971997  than is projected in the Greenbook, and consequently  we do not expect the unemploymentrate to move quite so low as  in the staff forecast.  The  good balance  we continue to see  isencouraging and happily it leaves  the economy in a position  that is less vulnerable  with regard tothe inevitable  shocks that  will come along.  In my view,  the risks to such an  outlook foreconomic  activity are slightly to the upside and--as  others  have  indicated--consumer  spendingrepresents  the  greatest risk.  If, despite  the  deterioration in consumer balance  sheets,  strongincome  growth and confidence  fuel consumer  spending beyond  our estimates,  we certainly couldget  increased overall  demand pressures.  In particular,  if consumers  add to their spending  bylowering their saving rate or capitalizing  on their increase  in wealth, the pressures  on resourceswill be exacerbated.Of course, the tight labor markets  that we have talked  about and are watching  closely,as  well as the scenario  that Ted Truman mentioned  in which  oil prices  linger at higher levels,could among other things create  pressures that feed through to higher price  inflation ifaccommodated  by monetary policy.  As is  always the case in judging inflationary  risk, we  mustmake judgments  about the current stance  of policy.  While the recent experience  with the growthof the monetary  aggregates raises some  questions, other measures  of policy including real ratesof interest  do not suggest to me that our policy is clearly in an accommodative  stance.  Giventhat the broader  measures of inflation  and the adjusted  CPI continue  to hold at moderately lowand relatively  steady levels and are not projected to show  any  significant deterioration  until1998,  we appear to be  at a point where  we can feel  reasonably good about both the outlook andcurrent  policy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman,  overall economic growth in our District seems  tobe moderating  a little.  The  level of activity is still high, especially  in manufacturing.  Some ofthe information  we have for our District  differs somewhat  from what Jack Guynn  was sayingabout the  Atlanta District.  We see  substantial  strength in a number of industries--chemicals  inVirginia and West  Virginia, textiles  for the first time in a while, and lumber and aluminumproducts  as well.  We  hear that  a number of plants in these industries  are operating  near fullcapacity.Labor market conditions,  as seems  to be the case elsewhere,  have not eased at all inour region  as far as we  can tell.  Reports  of rising wages  and prices--and  this is where  ourinformation  may differ  a little from some things  that other folks have said--while certainly notuniversal  are more  widespread now than they have been in the last several months.  To give youan example  of the kind of anecdotal  information  we are getting  along these lines,of a large building materials  and hardware chain  told usthat a number of his suppliers  are now trying "to go up in price," to use his words.  To be  a littlemore specific  on this, we did a special  survey recently  of about  100 firms in both themanufacturing  and services  sectors.On the manufacturing  side, strong foreign  competition  is still keeping  textile makersand metal producers  from passing along  increases in wages and the cost of basic materials.  Butin some  other industries--notably  furniture  and paper, electrical equipment,  and machinery--weget reports that some of these companies  are now able to pass along their wage  and other costincreases  more easily than  had been the case  in prior months.  For example, one producer ofelectrical  equipment  said that his customers  now  see  and understand that price increases  this yearare  almost inevitable.  A manufacturer  of bearings  reported  that his customers  seem now to be2/4-5/97resigned to  some price increase  later this year.  In  the services  sector, nearly  two-thirds of thefirms we contacted reported  increased business costs, and half of these said that they expected tobe able to pass through  at least some of these higher costs to their customers.  Again, thistendency is not universal but we see considerably  more evidence  of it and get more frequentcomments  along these lines than we  did just a  few months  ago.Turning to the national picture, the projections  we submitted are fairly close to thosein the Greenbook, but we got there by a different  route.  Let me quickly explain that.  We used asmall VAR  model in developing  our projections.  When  we initially generated  projections  underthe assumption of no change  in monetary  policy, the  result was an increase  in the CPI to a rateabove  3 percent this year and next year despite  the  likelihood of some diminution in energy pricepressures  over this period.  So, we then redeveloped  our projection on the assumption  that theCommittee will take whatever policy actions  seem to be required  to hold the CPI at or below 3percent,  starting in the period immediately  ahead.  In our particular model this requires  anincrease in the funds rate of about  50 basis points early on.  The  main point I want to make here,though, and  I am trying to respond to the point that Jerry Jordan mentioned  earlier, is that our 3percent CPI projection is not just an unconditional  forecast but a projected result for the yearahead.  It is consistent with the Committee's  longer-term  projection for inflation  based on theassumption that the Committee  will take  whatever policy action  seems necessary to increase  theprobability that we  will achieve  our inflation objective.With respect to the Greenbook  itself, I have  to say that the  general contour of theGreenbook  projection troubles me a little.  It  shows the core CPI rising to  about 3-1/4 percent in1998.  As I think someone else has already mentioned, the rate  would rise to about 3-1/2 percentexcept for the technical adjustments by the BLS.  Moreover, the language of the Greenbook, as  I2/4-5/97read it, suggests  that the risk of error is tilted a bit to the upside in the current  forecast.  Whatreally caught my eye in the Greenbook,  though,  was a statement  that our forecast has edgedfurther in the  direction of a more cyclical  pattern of inflation overshooting, which  typically hasbeen followed by monetary tightening  and then a period of economic  weakness.  I assume thetightening referred to here is the possibility of a very sharp tightening at some point  down theroad after we  may have  let things get  away from us, and that tightening could then be followedby a very weak economic  outcome.  I hope we will do whatever  we can to avoid that outcome.Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  District economic activity  has picked up in the pastfew months.  Auto dealers reported  a flat November  and December compared  with a year ago,but most expect a pickup in the first half of 1997.  District auto production,  which benefits  fromthe popularity of light trucks, is expected  to rise  3.6 percent in the first quarter from its year-agolevel  and to rise even  more in the second quarter.  Most District contacts  are optimistic  about thenear term.  Many  firms have announced plans  for expansion, but tight labor markets remain  aproblem for many employers, especially  in the construction  and information technologyindustries.  There  are  a few reports  of rising prices, mainly in the transportation  and publicutility sectors  where increased energy  costs are being passed along to customers.At the national level,  the economy is on  a relatively balanced  growth path.  With  a 4.7percent  surge in  the fourth quarter, the  year's real GDP growth came in at a rate  of about 3-1/2percent, well above the  1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent forecast range that we reported to the Congress ayear ago.  Momentum  from 1996 and the absence  of significant imbalances  in the economy2/4-5/97make us optimistic  about the growth outlook for 1997.  Our projections are for real  growth  atabout trend, with a continued  upward creep  in the CPI by another couple of tenths.Quite apart  from Jerry  Jordan's letter,  I find this semi-annual  forecasting exercisesomewhat  frustrating and potentially  misleading.  We are  asked to assume what would be anappropriate monetary  policy in  making our forecast.  In my view,  an appropriate policy would  beone that moves inflation  systematically lower over the next several years  and one that makes  thatobjective explicit.  This approach would certainly  affect the inflation outlook  for 1998  and  1999and quite likely for  1997  as well.  In fact, under such  a policy regime our forecast for  1997  CPIinflation would be considerably  lower than the one  we actually  submitted.  But if I submitted  thatlower number knowing  the FOMC has not shown  much inclination  to pursue the policy regime  Ijust described,  and let us say some other members  did as  well, what would  be the result?  Theforecast  range and perhaps the  central tendency  of the forecasts  submitted by the  members wouldbe biased  downward.  It would  look as if the  FOMC as a group is more  sanguine  about  theinflation outlook than  it is in fact.  I think we need to be concerned about how the publicinterprets  these forecasts, because  they could be used to decipher  our implicit inflationobjectives.  What did the public learn from  1996?  In February,  we projected CPI inflation in a2-1/2 to 3  percent  range.  As the  year progressed,  both output and inflation  came in well  aboveexpectations  and long-term bond yields rose, yet  we took no policy actions.  Instead, we raisedthe CPI inflation forecast in July to a range  of 3  to 3-1/4 percent.  So, what is the message aboutour inflation  objective?  I think one could conclude--I don't say I believe this--that we seem  quitecomplacent with  CPI inflation at or even above  3  percent,  which I think is  an unfortunateconclusion.  In my view  a far better  approach  would be for us to specify  our definition  of pricestability.  Presumably,  it would be less than 3 percent.  Some of us had  suggested  a 0 to 2 percent2/4-5/97range, the midpoint of which happens  to coincide  with the Boskin Commission's estimate of theupward bias in the CPI.  Setting such a longer-term objective  and a timetable to achieve it wouldmake our forecasts  more meaningful  for the public  and ourselves.  Thank you.

MR.  HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  economy in our District continues todo well.  Our directors  and other contacts report  solid growth throughout the District.Manufacturing  remains  quite healthy.  Construction  activity, while off slightly due to weatherconditions,  is keeping pace  with activity of a year ago.  I might mention thatwho is  involved with indicated that they had a very strong  year.covers much of the western part of the United States,  and what is  happening to them provides  apretty good idea of developments  in the area's economy  more generally.  I would like  to sharesome of that.  In terms of monthly year-over-year  data, hadincreased  more than  6 percent  for the sixth consecutive  month in December.  Shipments of theleading  commodity groups were all posting increases,  with energy products  up 11  percent--a  lotof that being coal hauled out of Wyoming.  Intermodal  shipments  were up 8  percent;  finishedautomobiles  were up 4 percent despite some lingering  effects of the auto strike, and automotiveparts were up  11  percent.  This  activity continued through January,  and while results were underbudget last month they would have been on budget  except for the weather conditions in thewestern  part of the system.  So, with this very good start for 1997,  theyare  looking for a very good year  again.Reinforcing this generally  favorable  information  from our District and  fromparticularly, we also saw some pretty sharp increases  in District employmentfor both October and November.  And on the basis of some of the anecdotal  information  we are2/4-5/97getting, such increases  seem to be continuing  in December.  In our region's  energy sector,drilling  activity is up significantly  over a year ago because  of the effects of the cold weather  onoil prices.  Retail  prices, I must continue  to report, are  not showing any  sizable increases,  butwage pressures  continue to be reported in our labor markets  and these are becoming  moreprevalent.On the national  level,  while I may differ on the components,  I am in broad agreementwith the outlook presented by the staff here today.  In particular, I expect  real GDP to grow at orslightly above its long-run potential this year and on into next.  With GDP growth coming infaster than expected  in the fourth quarter of last year, I think the economy is further beyond itslong-run production capacity  than we thought in December.I want to make one specific  observation on the topic  of inflation.  Coming back to  myquestion  earlier to Ted Truman,  I have some concern  that the energy price increases  that we sawlast year may not be  as transitory as we may have thought.  Energy prices  may come down butperhaps not  as much we  had originally  thought, given some  of the conversations  we have  hadwith contacts  in the energy  industry.  I  also am concerned that the moderation in compensationcosts, particularly  in the benefits  areas, may be reversed as we go further  into this year.  Lookingahead then and  given the  current stance of policy, I would expect the economy to continue togrow above  trend, perhaps  only slightly so,  and inflation to creep  up  systematically as we lookforward to the next  12  to  18 months.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  New England's  economic  pictureremains much the same.  It is characterized  by slow, steady growth overall and  pockets ofweakness in Connecticut, Maine, and Rhode  Island that are offset by islands of strength, notably2/4-5/97in Massachusetts.  Overall  employment growth is modest  at a rate only  about half that for thecountry  as  a whole.  At the same time, unemployment  rates are low and labor markets  are verytight in certain  areas,  particularly for certain skills.  This situation is especially true in the greaterBoston area and some other areas in Massachusetts,  where local labor markets haveunemployment  rates in the 3 percent and the low 4 percent areas.  Rates  this low were last seenthere in the late  1980s.  Added to this in the Boston area, we have rising consumer prices,  risinghousing prices, very low commercial  vacancy rates, anecdotal reports  of lowering creditstandards and terms, and the general  ease of financing just about anything.  So, we get a pictureof an economy--at  least in the  Boston area--that  is poised for a boom.Despite this, wage pressure  seems small.  Average  hourly earnings  in the regionincreased only 2 percent or so  over a year  ago, and the rise was even  smaller in Massachusetts.Our contacts suggest that wages  will rise 3 to 4 percent in the coming year, with  some outliers--especially in manufacturing--granting  higher increases.  Benefits cost  increases,  however,  areexpected  to be small, with actual decreases in workers' compensation  costs.Some of the  anomaly of a growing,  and in some areas  close  to booming, economy andvery low wage increases  might be explained by several  anecdotes  we have heard recently.  Atour regular New England  council meeting--this is  a group of small business people with somelabor and social  services representation--a  common theme developed.  In every case the smallbusiness representative,  whether in the automobile, the jewelry,  or the measuring  devicesindustry, reported  intense pressures  from all their customers--particularly  large customers but notjust the GMs or the Wal-Marts--not just to hold the line  on prices but to lower them year afteryear.  In another conversation  with a local  consultant  who does a lot of work  forI was told that cost plus is no longer used as a method of setting prices.  Rather,2/4-5/97follows  a price-minus policy, which  looks to  adjust internal  costs and prices paid tosuppliers to  maintain or improve  margins  in a constant  final price environment.  Clearly,  thepressure that large  customers  exert on smaller  suppliers  in New England is limiting what priceincreases  they can charge, what prices they will pay suppliers,  what margins they earn, and whatwage increases  they can afford  to pay employees.  But these companies  also face  tight laborare getting too expensive for some of these businesses.  So, there  is a considerable  tensionbuilding, and  I think we had a greater  sense of that in our last meeting than we  have had before.I believe there  are similar tensions on  a nationwide  basis, and they  are very  evident inthe forecast  provided by the Greenbook,  in the data  compiled  locally for our own Humphrey-Hawkins  forecast, and in  many commercial  forecasts.  We are  not as pessimistic  aboutproductivity as the Greenbook  authors,  and we are projecting somewhat higher potential  growthrates.  So, by  1998  our unemployment  forecast does not drop down to 5  percent.  However, evenwith that, we see trajectories  for the core CPI and the ECI quite  similar to those suggested  in theGreenbook--a  decided upturn in those measures  of inflation.  We do not see inflation  rising now,though there  are certainly  signs  of wage pressures.  But given  the solid path of economic  growthsuggested by the employment  data, increases in personal  income, rising  consumer confidence,continuing business investment, liquid financial markets,  and increased consumer wealth,  we areled to expect very  definite signs  of capacity  pressures on the economy that will lead to risinginflation.  I recognize  that there are restraining influences  in the foreign sector, in  governmentspending, and perhaps in residential  investment, but I am impressed by the fact that the surprisesin  1996, if one looks  at the year as  a whole  rather than quarter by quarter, have largely been  on2/4-5/97the upside.  It is hard to believe  that the tensions within the economy  are not building.  The issuewould seem to be when to address  them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The reports  on theSecond District's  economy have been  steady to slightly stronger in recent weeks.  The region'sjob market,  which had shown some  signs of slowing in September and October, picked up a bitin the  final two months of 1996.  In New  York State, private nonfarm  payrolls grew  at an annualrate  of 1.1  percent  in November  and December  versus  1 percent  in the prior two months.  Totalpayroll  employment  grew at a modest 0.5 percent annual  rate  in both of the  last two months ofthe year, held back by ongoing downsizing  in government.  The unemployment  rate  drifted upfrom a 6-year low of 5.9 percent to 6.1  percent,  but the entire increase  was due to faster laborforce growth.  In New Jersey, private  nonfarm payrolls grew at a 2.6 percent  annual rate  in thefinal  couple of months of 1996,  up sharply from earlier in the year.  As in New York State,however, sharp declines  in government  employment restrained overall job growth to a still quitebrisk  1.6 percent.  The state's  unemployment rate  is 6.2 percent.Consumer spending seemed to be rather good.  Major retailers reported  that holidaysales in the region were on or above  plan, with November-December  same  store sales running5.8 percent  above  1995.  Post-holiday  sales  seemed to be quite strong.  A separate  survey  ofsmall retailers  across  New York State  showed same  store sales up 4 to 6 percent from thecomparable period in  1995,  with even  stronger reports coming from Manhattan.  Sales there  wereperhaps not unrelated to the earnings  in the securities  industry;  apparel  and jewelry sales  wereparticularly strong.  New  York State decided to take a 1-week  vacation  in its 8-1/2 percent salestax and that  helped to clear out the stores  in the third week of January.  Big-ticket durables,2/4-5/97however,  were somewhat  slower sellers, especially  furniture  and electronics.  Discounting bythe retailers  was lower than was required in the previous year, and  so their earnings  seemedpretty good.Residential  real estate markets are gaining momentum, led mainly by the multifamilysector.  The apartment market  in New York City is getting  quite strong  and the prices of NewYork apartments  are going up.  Another  indication  of the  same sort of phenomenon  is the oldmasters'  sale  at Sotheby's last week, which brought prices that were  far above  the expectationsgoing into the sale.  The office  market in Manhattan  continues to improve.  The New  YorkDistrict therefore is  looking rather good.  The inflation rate  for the greater  New York area--2.9percent for Q4 to Q4  in 1996--is a little better than that for the country  as a whole.On the national  picture,  we think GDP growth will moderate  substantially  from theunsustainable  4.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1996.  Consumer spending started the yearwith little forward  momentum;  housing is edging down;  and we think fourth-quarter  activity innonresidential construction  and foreign  trade borrowed from the future.  So, the central tendencyof growth still looks to us to  be near 2 percent, with a gradual  drifting down  as time passes andthe expansion  ages further.  Under  that scenario,  the unemployment rate in  our forecast remainsin the  vicinity of 5-1/2 percent.  We think GDP is likely  to grow  at a very  slow rate  of about1-1/2  percent this quarter.  We do not think that there  are any fundamental  forces  at work that arelikely to cause a significant deviation from potential  growth, which we put at 2 percent.  Inflationboth for prices  and overall labor costs remains  somnolent.  We still  see significant risks  of someacceleration  in inflation largely because  average  hourly  earnings  growth has picked upnoticeably,  and we do not have the data yet  to see  whether that is being financed byimprovements  in productivity.  The more  comprehensive  wage components  of the ECI exhibit2/4-5/97less acceleration.  The increase in the  fourth quarter of last year matches  a seasonal pattern,  andtherefore I am not sure that one should multiply it by four.We continue to be very concerned,  as we have  been all year and  as I think isappropriate,  that the risks of inflation are  on the high side.  But in the context of the commentsthat some others  have made about their Districts  so far, I think one has to be very careful  todistinguish between the risk of inflation  and  seeing it as  a reality.  We do not see  it yet as areality.  Nor do we see the  raw ingredients  in labor markets,  commodity markets,  or otherhorizon to indicate that preemptive  action  is required  at  this time.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Philadelphia  District economy  isgrowing moderately  overall,  with some strong areas  and tight labor markets in centralPennsylvania, some  Philadelphia suburbs,  and Delaware.  The rest of the District is improvingfor the most part but more  modestly.  Although  there  are examples  of large wage increases,  thegeneral situation is still one of moderate  wage  hikes and subdued  price  increases.  One sectorwhere  significant  strengthening  may occur is in commercial  construction  in the  Philadelphiaarea.  Current market values  for commercial  buildings have  been well under replacement  costvalues for six or seven years.  Current market values  are now approaching replacement  costvalues in the faster growing  suburbs of Philadelphia.  Build-to-suit construction  is picking  up,and there is talk of the emergence  of some speculative building.  There is still caution fromlenders  and that is a constraint.  REITs  have been back for a while and  reportedly are pushing upthe values  of some buildings.  Given  the time lags  that are  involved in purchasing  land, zoning,2/4-5/97permits, et cetera,  the real strength  in construction probably will not be in evidence until  1998  or1999.Turning to the nation, we clearly have  a robust economy.  The rapid pace of the  fourthquarter is not likely to carry over in  the near term because  of slackening net exports.Nonetheless,  there  is an  underlying momentum that  is likely to keep  growth at least on amoderate  path.On inflation,  the basic  question is whether we believe the models, which  are based  onpast experience,  or whether we believe that the  most recent experience  of remarkably  good pricebehavior will continue  in the future.  We can  speculate,  but we do not know the answer  to thatquestion,  and that is why  "wait and see,"  despite  its risks,  is still  a reasonable  course  for now.

MR. MCTEER.  On the national  economy,  our estimates are  very similar to the broadoutlines of the staff forecast  in the Greenbook.  We are right on with real  GDP, while ourinflation  and unemployment  forecasts are just a little higher.  There  are a number of risks in theseforecasts,  however, and on balance those risks  probably are  slightly  on the upside.  With regardto  one upside inflation  risk, our conversations  with people in the energy industry tend to  supportwhat Tom Hoenig said about widespread doubts that  the prospective  decline in energy costs  isgoing to offset the earlier  increases  fully.  The decline  is likely to be a partial rather than a fulloffset.  Furthermore, people  do not expect the full amount of a decline in wholesale crude oilprices  to be reflected  in retail prices because  of the tightness  of refinery capacity  all over theworld.  Another potential upside  source  of inflation is the decline in bond yields  over the last halfyear and its effects in boosting aggregate  demand in  1997.  Fiscal  policy may provide less of adrag on household spending  with the end of the retroactive  phased-in  income tax  boost that2/4-5/97resulted from the  1993  budget  agreement.  The disinflation in medical  costs seems likely to slowor come to an end fairly soon.  It's hard to imagine  it continuing at its recent  pace.  The rollingregional recessions  of the last 20 years  seem to have  ended.  All regions  of the country  appear tobe in  an expansion  mode right now, and  the ability of labor  and other resources to move  anddamp  the impact  of shortages in certain parts  of the country  would seem to be more  limited.  Weare feeling  the effects  of that in Texas now, where  the reduced  inflow of labor from the rest ofthe country and from Mexico  is slowing our labor  force growth  and putting  some limits on ouroutput growth.A federal  budget balancing deal could cause  a bout of exuberance  in the bond marketand could provide added upward momentum to the economy and  equity markets.  On the otherhand, with regard  to downside risks I didn't know  that economists  had  a third hand until today--[Laughter]

MS.  RIVLIN.  That is a new  low in economist jokes.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  It has the virtue of being very short.  On the downside,  high debtburdens may induce households to restrain consumer  spending.  Banks are just beginning to getserious about  tightening their consumer credit  lending standards.  The higher dollar and fallingoil prices  should  restrain price pressures.  The broader measures of inflation  suggest moresubdued inflationary pressures  than are reflected  in the  overall CPI.  Along the lines  of what BillMcDonough just mentioned,  "pipeline" inflation  pressures  do not seem  to be there.  Commodity2/4-5/97prices, in particular the price of gold, do not indicate  much in the way of coming inflationarypressures.Turning to the Eleventh  District economy, it has  changed little since the Decembermeeting.  Employment  growth has  slowed over the past few  months and now seems to haveconverged toward  the national  rate.  District employment  growth  was at a 2 percent annual ratein the fourth quarter versus about  1.7  percent  nationally.  As  I mentioned here  before, typicallyTexas  and the  Eleventh District economy  more generally have higher employment  growth thanthe national average  but also  higher unemployment  growth because  of the inflow of labor fromother parts  of the country  and from across  the Mexican border.  The health of the Californiaeconomy in particular  and the rebound in Mexico have  diminished that inflow, and ouremployment  growth  has slowed but our unemployment  level also has  gone down  considerablythis year.  Labor shortages  and tight labor markets  rather than weak demand  seem to be  drivingthe slowdown  in employment  growth in our District.The energy sector has been running at  absolutely full capacity for  about a year now,with shortages  of most types  of drilling  and maintenance  equipment becoming more  and morewidespread.  Companies  are  either trying to increase capacity  or to stop producing products  withrelatively  low profit margins.  In our Beigebook  survey, we  had one interesting  anecdote  about  aservice company for the oil industry.  They gave  up  on their  attempts to hire local machinistsand  started importing  them from England.  They also wanted  to expand capacity  so theiroptimism  led them to rip out their racketball  court and put that part of the building intoproduction.  But their caution  led them not to want to expand their building  beyond its presentfootprint, so they limited their expansion to the area of the racketball  court that they already  hadunder the roof.2/4-5/97Labor market tightness has not eased.  The unemployment rate  fell throughout  1996 inspite  of reports that a number  of Texans are leaving the welfare  rolls.  I don't know whether theyare  leaving the welfare  rolls because  of the changes in welfare programs,  but they are doing so infairly large numbers.  Reports on price pressures  have been  mixed.  The people who conduct ourBeigebook  survey tell me that they are hearing more  stories of price increases  lately, but  newcapacity in construction-related  industries has eased price pressures, particularly  for cement.  Allthings considered,  the Eleventh District economy is in quite good shape  and is expected toremain  so.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stem.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank you.  I am hard pressed to report  anything new  with regard to theNinth District economy.  Overall, the economy  is healthy, labor is in short  supply, and theweather is lousy even  seasonally adjusted.  [Laughter]  One interesting anecdote  came from acouple  of business people  who reported  that they have postponed  expansion plans because  theycannot hire laborers.  That implies, of course, that they have  been unwilling  to pay the higherwages  that presumably would enable them to hire those workers.  They have not  articulated thereasons why they have been unwilling to pay those wages.  I assume it has to do with theirestimates of the cost implications and what they think they can  get in terms  of pricing.  In anyevent, a labor  shortage clearly has been a factor for some time,  and we have had some furtherreports of that.As  far as the national economy  is concerned, I do think the  growth of the realeconomy will slow to trend in  1997.  From my perspective,  however, that is perhaps  not asfavorable  an outcome as  it seems because  my suspicion is that aggregate  demand  will continue  torise more rapidly than trend.  I have what is essentially  a supply-constrained  forecast.  That is, I2/4-5/97do not think productivity  will rise  rapidly enough in  1997 to offset slower growth in the  laborforce  and employment.  If my assessment that demand will continue  to increase more rapidlythan supply is correct,  then the risks of more inflation  clearly are there and  will intensify.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I would dearly  love to say something startlingly different,  but I think Iwould have  to be  living in a different country.  We  really do seem to have  accumulating evidenceof a quite consistent picture.  The strong  growth in the  fourth quarter, like the strong growth  inthe  second quarter, clearly will not continue and will be followed by a significantly  weaker firstquarter.  This back-and-forth  pattern not only in growth but in some other statistics  issuperficially confusing, but overall we  are getting a remarkably  consistent picture  of healthy andvery broadly based economic  growth,  geographically and industrially.  It is a more solid picturethan I think we felt we had six months ago, but it is no roaring  boom either.  Tight labor marketsare  reported almost everywhere, wages  are creeping up, increases  in benefit  costs are  leveling outbut the growth in such costs is likely to turn up and to rise more  sharply as  we get to the end  ofthe shift in the provision of health  services to managed care.  The productivity  data remainsignificantly mysterious;  the low increases  do not seem to fit with other indicators.I have no major quarrel  with the staff analysis  or forecast.  I might be a tad moreoptimistic about the prospects for relatively gimmick-free  deficit reductions than they say theyare, including  something in the legislation  that would contain significant Medicare  and Medicaidrestraints that might continue into the future.  That certainly  would be a desirable outcome  andthe bond markets  probably would respond to it.  I think, incidentally, that this good news mightbe threatened by the passage of a balanced budget  amendment.  I agree  with the staff that theamendment  is  not likely to pass, and that probably  would be  a good outcome.  I would be2/4-5/97surprised if the unemployment  rate got  down quite  as low as the staff forecast indicates.  On theother hand, I share  some of the nervousness  about oil prices, which might feed into  slightlyhigher inflation than  the staff forecast.The question  before us as it was  the last time is really how long we can  expect thisvery favorable  set of indicators to continue.  I would  agree that the risks are on the upside,  butnothing  suggests an imminent danger of inflation  taking off.  So  "wait and see"  is a plausiblestrategy, but if we really believe the staff forecast, and on the basis  of what almost everybody  hasarticulated  around this table we do  not differ all that much, the real question is whether we  aretaking  a risk of waiting too long to tighten.  The question  remains:  Is this low inflation with tightlabor markets  sustainable;  is it a new situation that could persist;  or is it some kind  of temporaryadjustment  at the end of which more normal  relationships will reassert  themselves?  If the latteris what is going to occur, we  should be thinking  ahead to what those  normal relationships  havealways been.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  In the midst of the enormous  plethora  ofdata and impressions  that one is subjected  to, I have been asking  myself what developments  overthe recent past seem to be significant.  I would like to list six things--three  of them because theyare moving  and three because they  are not.First are the  three that seem to me to be moving, and I would  have to put wagepressures  at the top of that list.  It seems clear that those pressures  are present  and probably arestrengthening  as time goes  along.  Where that is really  important is in what it implies for unitlabor  costs, and  I don't think that is quite as clear.  I would like to know how many  stories  like2/4-5/97are  out there.  I particularly like that example  because I once ran plastic  moldingsplants  and I understand  them.  I don't know how widespread  that is and I don't know howproductivity and these wage  pressures interface,  but that  is a very powerful  input, whatever  it is,and it does  seem to be moving in the direction of more  pressure.The  second thing is the fourth-quarter GDP, particularly the message there that theconsumer is back.  The question  is whether  this strength in consumer spending  is going to holdup and be long-lasting or whether it is just temporary  and will follow the  saw-tooth pattern thatwe have become  familiar with throughout this expansion.  Here  again,  I think we have a verypowerful  force, but one  that at this point seems to me to be completely  inscrutable.  Consumerconfidence, the  wealth effect, and job formations  seem to indicate that it might have  stayingpower.  On the  other hand we have  the high level of consumer  debt and a question  as to whetheror not there  exists  a great deal of pent-up demand.  Those questions  would indicate  that GDPgrowth might fade back to a sustainable  rate.  If some of the supporting factors  start to go away,like the wealth effect through  a stock market break,  consumer expenditures  could actually fade toless than  a sustainable level and could become  a possibly serious downside  risk at some point.The  third thing is the recent  movement of the dollar.  As we know, the stronger dollarshould tend to weaken  exports.  It  also should tend to hold inflation in check.There  are three important  things that do not appear to me to moving much.  I wouldmention first the large number of inflation  indices.  We are all focused on the CPI; we have beentalking about it a lot, but it is not necessarily  that typical.  There  are many other price  indices thatare not moving up and indeed a number that are moving down.  Now,  that is not determinative  inand of itself because  the Committee has worked ahead of those series in the past, and  I am sure itwill again.  I think it is significant that  subdued inflation has been the trend for many quarters2/4-5/97now.  It has persisted in the face of what we have regarded  over some long period  of time asbeing considerable  upward pressure,  and yet  inflation by these measures  still stays pretty muchthe same.  This raises  a lot of questions in my mind  about what may be  going on in the economy,and I would love to get some answers  somehow.  I don't know if we will.Another thing that does not seem to be changing  much is that no new  driving forcesappear to be emerging.  There  are no new  engines that seem  likely to push the economy towardeither consistent strength  or weakness.  We seem to be enjoying an  extended  stay on themountain top that Governor Meyer mentioned  a week  or two ago, and who knows how long thatLastly,  it does not seem to me that we have much pressure  on capacity  utilization, andwithout that I wonder  how much inflationary pressure  is likely to emerge  in the economy.  Mybottom line is that I am very nervous  about what  may be happening  as  a result  of the tight laborthan the other five factors  or anything  else.  An  enormously important question in my mind is theenigma of the consumer.  I guess we will just have to wait and  see how much that potentialstrength stays there.  All in all, I continue to think that it makes  sense  to wait and  see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  almost everybody has mentioned,  theeconomy ended  1996  on  a strong note.  The question now is whether  this is just a single burst ofenergy and the economy  is about to settle down to the proverbial  sustainable path, or does thisburst of energy  portend a stronger growth path that will strain resources  and lead to inflationarypressures.  I think there is a corollary  question relating  to the high level  of economic  activity atyear-end, namely that even if the economy  does return to a sustainable growth path, will we be2/4-5/97seeing pressures  because the economy  is operating  at such a high level, thus  straining resources.During the current expansion,  which is now in its sixth year, we have  had several  of these stronggrowth episodes  and it is probably fair to say that monetary policy has had a lot to  do with theseabove-trend  bursts, particularly through  at least the first half of 1996.  So, it is up to us to makesome kind of assessment  of the current uptick in  economic growth.The arguments for a return to the sustainable path that are presented  in the Greenbookanalysis  are reasonable.  Exports, which  accounted  for much of the fourth-quarter  growth, areunlikely to provide a sustainable boost.  There were  a number  of unusual  factors in  thefourth-quarter trade results,  and going forward the  strength of the dollar makes U.S.  goods  moreexpensive.  Turning to spending,  although consumer  spending was strong in the fourth quarter,consumer debt may provide something of a constraint in the future.  This expansion is a bit too"long in the tooth" to look to pent-up demand  and in particular  to leveraged consumer spendingon large  items.  On a related  front,  housing activity seems  to have  slowed recently,  but I believethat the  fundamentals  are  strong enough  at least to allow  housing to contribute to sustainableeconomic  growth.  Most forecasters have  been looking to a slackening of business investment.Many businesses probably also recently expanded  capacity and replaced  equipment.  So, it isquestionable  as to how long we are going to see large increases  in business investment.  Isuppose  that computers and communications  equipment  are the exception.  They seem to involvea bottomless  spending pit.  Again, spending in this area should at least be adequate to keep us ona sustainable  growth path.  On the other hand,  fiscal policy is likely to be a bit of a constraint.Having bought into the arguments  for a slackening of growth going forward,  let mehasten to point out that there do remain some  significant areas of strength  in the economy andthere  may be  some room  for surprises.  First of all,  the labor market continues strong.  Even  if2/4-5/97we do not get to that 5 percent  unemployment  rate forecast in  the Greenbook,  it is still  a strongreasonable to expect consumption  to continue  at a level at least in step with income  growth.  Inview of the strength of income  of late, consumer spending could feasibly create unanticipateddemands.  I think confidence measures  support this scenario.In another  area, business investment has been  a consistent  surprise during thisexpansion and consistently underestimated.  The same fundamentals  that brought these  surprisescould still be present.  These include  strong profits and cash  flows, the low cost of capital, aready  availability of credit, falling computer and communications  equipment prices,  and theemphasis  on efficiency  and productivity that has inspired a number  of firms to continue  to invest.The stock market  is another area where we  always have to say that there  is room forsurprises.  Either we have an irrationally exuberant  market or it is fundamentally  driven.  Nomatter what the verdict, either could provide continued sources of investment  funding for firmsand the wealth effect should continue to support consumer  spending.Where  does all  of this leave us with respect to inflation?  Although recently it hasbeen benign, it is hard to believe  that we can continue  to enjoy this Goldilocks, just-righteconomy forever without feeling  inflation pressures.  Wage pressures  already are being reportedanecdotally  and are  showing up in wage  and compensation  statistics.  Benefit cost constraintsproductivity, but it is hard to count on this very broadly in view of the recently disappointingstatistical history of productivity.  The staff is now suggesting that they are being optimistic  inestimating the new trend growth line at .9 percent.  Energy costs--and  several people  have2/4-5/97mentioned this--also have the potential  for sustained pressures  if crude prices do not fall back asforecast.  I think the jury is still out there.In sum, I think the arguments  for a return to a sustainable trend level  of GDP growthare fairly persuasive,  but there  are reasons  to believe that the probabilities  of stronger growthaccompanied  by building price pressures are  increasing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer, you are  the cleanup  hitter.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The fourth-quarter  GDP report marks  anextraordinary  end to an extraordinary  year.  The defining feature  of both the fourth quarter andthe year as a whole  was a pleasing combination  of higher-than-expected  growth and lower-than-expected  inflation, including declines  in core measures  of inflation.  How  did we do it andcan we do it again?  Three  developments  I think  contributed importantly  to the extraordinaryperformance  last year.First, a sharp rebound  in the participation  rate  and hence in labor force growthprevented  the strong output growth from pushing the unemployment rate even  lower and therebypressuring inflation.  Second, a coincidence  of what I would refer to  as positive  supply shocks,including the further  slowing in the rate of increase  in benefit costs, the  decline in  nominalimport prices, and  the sharper-than-normal  decline in computer prices  collectively restrainedcore  measures of inflation.  And third, the level  of NAIRU may have declined  or at least wecame to recognize  during last year that NAIRU  had recently declined  from its average  level overthe last decade.The message  here is that while we should certainly  celebrate  last year's remarkableperformance,  we should not expect to repeat it.  Growth must now slow  or the risk to inflationwill become  unacceptable.  True, I came with this message last July, but now I really mean it.2/4-5/97[Laughter]  I also  said then that even if growth slows to trend, there will remain  an  inflation riskfrom the prevailing low unemployment rate.  Still, the immediate  prospects  are for a benigneconomy in the near term, assuming,  of course, a significant  slowing in growth and thanks inpart to inertia in the inflation  process and  a projected reversal  of last year's  decline in oil prices.  Iam still in the camp of those who firmly expect a decline  in oil prices.The unexpected  strength of fourth-quarter growth does, however, put back into thepicture what I have referred  to as the growth risk in the outlook--the  risk that going forwardgrowth will remain above  trend  and push utilization rates even higher beginning from a levelalready  at or beyond capacity.  To be sure,  the growth in several components  of GDP in thefourth  quarter, specifically in  consumer services,  nonresidential  structures,  and exports,  isunsustainable, and  there is little  doubt that the expansion  will slow as a result in the first quarter.The surge in net exports,  the most important contributor to  the fourth-quarter  growth spurt, inmy judgment reflects importantly  the residual  seasonality in that component.  But this means thatthe sharp rebound  in net exports  posted in the  fourth quarter more likely occurred more evenlyover the entire  year.  The bottom line is  that although the fourth-quarter  growth rate may bebiased upward,  the growth  over the entire  year is not.In light of the likelihood that several  components  of GDP posted unsustainable  spurtsin the fourth  quarter, I am comfortable with the staff forecast that growth is likely to slow to near2 percent  or even  below in the first quarter.  Still, what happens  in the first quarter is not the keyto the forecast.  After all, growth over  1996 proved unusually bouncy--2  percent in the firstquarter, 4.7 percent in the second, back  to 2.1  percent in third, then back  to 4.7 percent  in thefourth.  Reverting  back to 2 percent  in the  current  quarter will not, therefore,  settle the biggerquestion:  What happened  to the  second half slowdown  and how confident are we that the2/4-5/97economy  will slow over  1997?  If we  could correct for the residual  seasonality in net exports,  wemight actually see the second-half  slowdown.  At any rate,  as my former  partners  atMacroeconomics  Advisers  have  noted in their most recent weekly commentary,  the second-halfslowdown  is evident in a variety  of measures  of economic performance  not  directly polluted bynet exports--for example,  industrial  production,  payroll employment,  aggregate  hours worked,light vehicle sales, housing  starts, personal consumption  expenditures,  real  gross domesticpurchases,  and real  final sales to domestic purchasers.On balance,  therefore,  I still view the economy as  having  slowed over the second halfof 1996  and this helps me to be comfortable  with a forecast  of a  further slowing to a 2 to 2-1/2percent rate over  1997.  This judgment is reinforced  by my expectation that federal  purchasesand net exports  will decline,  that inventory investment  will trend lower, and that key cyclicalsectors such as  housing and  auto sales have achieved  cyclical peaks  and will  decline at leastmodestly.  However, I continue  to believe  that the most serious risk to the outlook does  notcome from continued  above-trend  growth but from the possibility that we are  already operatingabove capacity  and face  as a result a gradual but progressive  worsening  of the inflation  outlook.My interpretation  of inflation for the  year is that, while  sharp increases  in food  andenergy prices boosted  overall CPI inflation, the coincidence  of positive supply shocks  that Imentioned earlier put downward  pressure  on core inflation.  I do not believe,  therefore, that theaverage unemployment  rate for the year.  I suspect  that NAIRU, at least for the near term, is near5-1/2 percent.  Assuming the coincidence  of positive supply  shocks will not be repeated thisyear, at least not as uniformly  as last year,  I expect  an increase  in core inflation even if theunemployment  rate  stays  at its current level.  Cost pressures on firms nevertheless  appear to be2/4-5/97well contained,  given the modest acceleration  of compensation  over  1996 and the absence  ofpipeline inflation pressures  coming from core intermediate  and crude components  of the PPI.Still,  the acceleration  of wages  over 1996 indicated by the fourth-quarter ECI report  is consistentwith tight labor markets  and prevailing excess  demand.  Some further acceleration  of wagescombined  with a rebound  in benefit  costs certainly  supports the staff forecast of an  increase  inthe rate of compensation  over 1997  to  3-1/2 percent  from the 3.1  percent posted over 1996.  Thestaff forecast  is for slightly above-trend  growth over  1997, a further decline in the unemploymentrate to 5  percent,  and  a gradual upward creep in inflation  that does not take on worrisomeproportions  until  1998.  It is still  a pretty benign  outcome for  1997,  with inflation measured byboth the overall  CPI and the chained  GDP price index  projected at just a shade  above 2-1/2percent.  Still, the main message  is that the unemployment rate is  about to move  still furtherbelow NAIRU  and as  a result inflation pressures  are likely to build over the forecast  horizon.However, because  of the  inertia in the inflation process and the  reversal of energy prices in  1997the consequences  will not be  very evident until  1998 and beyond.Relative  to the staff forecast I expect  slightly slower  growth over 1997  accompaniedby a nearly stable unemployment  rate.  On the price side, I anticipate something  close to the  staffinflation  pattern through  1997, including  a small rebound in core  inflation and a decline  inoverall consumer  price inflation.  I do view the risks relative to this forecast  to be somewhatasymmetric, with a slightly greater risk of above-trend  growth  and a greater risk that we arealready below the NAIRU.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Good morning, everyone.  Brian Madigan,  would youstart us off, please?

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN.  Certainly, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring  to the package  labeled,"Material  for Staff Briefing on Annual  Ranges."  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions for Brian?

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Brian,  if we were to have a multiyear horizon  as our objective  forgetting to price  stability, perhaps  along  the lines of the price  stability alternative  in chart  2 of theBluebook, money  growth would be slower in that environment,  based on current relationships.Whether inflation, properly measured,  is 2 percent or 3 percent,  we do not know.  We know thereare  measurement  errors that affect the  implicit price  deflator and  other price indexes, but theanswer is going  to be  2 or 3 percent.  Based on the information  you have now, whateverassumption  you make  about own price and  the evidence  about how the Treasury  yield curvebehaves  relative to the funds rate,  how confident can you  be that if we maintain  a 5-1/4 percentfunds rate, there  will not be a deceleration  of M2  growth consistent  with a policy of moving toprice stability?

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN.  Given our methodology  for forecasting,  I think that really  is aquestion about how confident we are that nominal GDP growth would behave  as projected  in theGreenbook.  We forecast money demand  by looking at growth  rates of nominal  GDP, making anadjustment for projected  movements in opportunity  costs consistent  with any changes  in interestrates.  Obviously,  the staff could be wrong,  and one source of error in projecting money demandor money growth  would be our assessment of the likely  growth in nominal  GDP that would beconsistent with a 5-1/4 percent  funds rate.  Another source would be errors in projecting money2/4-5/97demand  itself, given a forecast for nominal GDP and interest rates.  Clearly,  we are  still veryuncertain at this point on that  score.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  But we can distinguish among forecasts  of nominal  GDP.  We do nottarget nominal GDP, but you can say there  is an  implicit nominal  GDP target if you have  a pricestability objective.  If you say your objective is to get nominal  GDP growth down  to the area of 2to 3 percent and if your analytical  framework tells you that M2  growth also would be around  2 to3 percent, then you can at least run the intellectual  exercise  as to what kind of interest rate pathwould be consistent with producing that outcome.  In Gary Stem's  words  yesterday, if we  have asupply-constrained  economy, then to  get to price  stability our task is to constrain nominaldemand  growth to  a rate consistent  with that aggregate  supply growth.

[SECTION]

MR.  MADIGAN.  Yes.  Certainly in the steady state, if you will, when price stabilityis achieved we would  not see a 5-1/4 percent nominal  federal  funds rate as  consistent with thatoutcome.  I guess the  question relates partly to what federal  funds rate  path will take  us to asteady  state with price  stability.  Chart 2 in the Bluebook presented one  scenario  where we  gavewhat we consider to be our best shot at projecting that sort  of interest rate path.  That involved,as you know,  a considerable  increase  in the nominal  and real  federal funds rates over the nextyear or two and then a reduction  in  the nominal  funds rate as inflation  came  down.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay, but chart 2 was developed  within the NAIRU  framework  andthe assumption  that we  know where the NAIRU  is and where the current rate  of unemploymentis relative to it.  I am  asking you to think through  the exercise  for us and abstract  from that.Have you or can you simply run through  those interest rate alternatives  presented in chart 2 and,based  on the statistical relationships in a money demand-opportunity  cost framework,  trace  outwhat kind of money growth would be produced?  That  is just an exercise.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I  guess I am a little unclear about what you are proposing,  PresidentJordan.  In the staffs view, you would have to raise interest rates  considerably to  get the lowernominal  GDP growth that you want.  If you are  asking us what would happen if hypotheticallynominal GDP  simply decelerated with the  funds rate being held at 5-1/4 percent,  obviouslymoney growth would come  in lower.  That I  agree is  an arithmetic  problem that we could solve.If  we were to raise  interest rates  as in the chart 2  case, money growth  as Brian said would comein even lower because  we would be moving  along the money demand  function at the  same time.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.  We  have run the exercise  at our Bank where, if we take yourprice  stability path and those related interest rate  movements that we can pick off of chart 2, weproduce an  M2 growth  of about  1 or 2 percent in about  3  or 4 years.

MR. KOHN.  That is totally plausible to me,  given that we had 3-1/2 or  3-3/4 percentM2  growth associated  with the smaller increase  in the federal  funds rate in the stable inflationalternative.  So,  lower M2 growth could well be  associated with those  higher interest rates.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I think that the Bluebook  with these alternatives  was very helpful thistime.  Certainly, it provided a great  deal of information  about some of the issues that were raisedin previous meetings  and that we clearly are interested in.  Don, there is one thing that I wantedto ask about chart  2.  In calculating the real rate of interest,  you used the PCE excluding energy.I know  you cannot be completely  comfortable  with that measure because  of the kind of real ratesthat it produces,  particularly  at the present time.  The surveys,  of course,  indicate expectations  ofabout 3 percent inflation one year ahead.  Do you have any comments  about some alternativeprice measure  that would be  a better approach to real  rates  than this PCE measure?  I ask becauseI think that measure is  very misleading?2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I agree  and we tried to convey that point in a long, complex  footnote.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  But I agree  with you.  I think that it is  very likely that people,  in formingtheir price expectations,  look at the whole  array of prices that they are paying and not just at thecore measures.  To us, the core PCE was  a little more revealing  of the underlying  sense of whatwas happening  to inflation,  and  it abstracted  from CPI measurement  changes  and relatedproblems.  So, the core PCE was better from that perspective, but I agree that it overstates  thelittle in  1997.  Indeed, they rise a little because  of the assumed decline  in energy prices, whichdepresses  total PCE or total  CPI.  Real rates  would then go down in  1998  as the total PCE  startsto trend up again.  But in  1997,  it looks as if real rates actually  rise a tick, if you just literally usethe total PCE rather than the core PCE.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further questions  for Brian?  If not, let me start offby saying that I do not see any significant change  from  the dilemma we  have had in recentmeetings  on these longer-run  objectives.  I would stick a little bush next to the  tree in Brian'schart to reverse  the pattern  slightly.  [Laughter]  The moment that we  alter the long-term ranges,we  are effectively  saying that M2 is back in play.  We then have to start to evaluate  how thethe monetary  aggregates  are back in play, that raises the question  of whether we are willing tosanction what amounts to nominal  GDP growth of perhaps  6 percent  with the implications  thathas for prices.  I seriously  question whether we would gain  anything of value  in monetary policydebates.2/4-5/97Looking at the other chart that Brian put together, aside from its wonderfulcolorfulness,  it does show  something really fascinating--which  we suspected a couple of quartersago--namely  that the slope  of the new  curve  seems  to be very close to the  slope of the old curve.The presumption that what we have  is merely  some form of dummy variable type shift is notcontradicted  by those  data, and indeed we may go  back to where we were.  You may recall  thatthe  last time we had this discussion the staff forecast for M2 was toward the upper end of the  1 to5  percent range,  and indeed  the staff came out right on the button.  The reason  they did is thatthey  assumed the new relationships,  and indeed  the new relationships  have held.I think there is very little to be  lost by staying where we are with  alternative I andwatching  what is going on merely because  we would be indicating that the ranges are notsomething  of significance. If we change  them, I think we will put in  play a wholly new  set ofissues  that we  have to address and for which I do not think  we are  prepared to come to anyconclusion.  As a consequence,  I  am close to where I was  the last time,  but I would be mostcurious to hear counterarguments  from others.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Could I just raise  a question, Mr. Chairman?  When  you indicated thata 2  to 6 percent  M2 range would be viewed as sanctioning  6 percent nominal income  growth, Iwas a little surprised.  Would you say that, consistent with the way these  ranges have been usedin the  past, it would take an increase  in money  growth above  the range to justify a tightening  ofpolicy?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  No, not necessarily.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  You could say, after all, that the higher range is  centered  on 4 percent,which would be centered  on 4 percent  nominal  income growth and  on 2 percent  real growth.2/4-5/97Could one justify a tightening of policy if growth moved toward the  top of that range?  That  ismy question.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  You could, but that is exactly the type of problem I amnot terribly  certain we want to get involved with.  In other words,  why take on an  added burdenwhen we ourselves  are uncertain  about these relationships  at  this stage?

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  That is the key.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I do not think it conveys  anything  that we cannotconvey by other means.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I think it is really simple.  It seems  to me that unless  we made terriblysophisticated  arguments,  moving to a  higher range would be interpreted as less vigilance  againstinflation  and that is not where we  are.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I cant  offer a counterargument,  Mr. Chairman,because I think it would be extraordinarily  unwise  to  shift from the present ranges  to the higherones.  First of all, it would give the wrong  signal about monetary policy.  Secondly,  even onBrian's tree  without your bush, we probably  will need to tighten  in  1997.  And this would get usinto a debate  in which we  would be talking about  M's and  Y's and foolishness  rather thanconcentrating  on price  stability  and the need to say more  about the  American  economy.  That iswhat I think we ought to spend our energy  talking about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, I agree  with your analysis  regarding M2, and Iwould favor alternative I pretty much  for the reasons you  stated.  Whatever range we  set for M2,though, I think we would all agree that the numerical ranges  for the aggregates  at this stage of2/4-5/97the  game are really not sufficient to convey completely our longer-run strategy  to the public  andthe Congress.  We have  a void there.  My personal  preference  would  be for the Committee to fillthe void with explicit multiyear inflation  targets  leading ultimately to price  stability.  TheCommittee has not been willing to do that yet.  In this situation, Mr. Chairman,  I think yourbiannual  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony is the principal  channel  that this Committee  uses toconvey its longer-term  strategy to  the Congress  and the public generally.  And given that, I hopeit will not be presumptuous  if I make just a couple  of quick suggestions regarding that testimony.I thought  your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  last July was particularly  constructivebecause it included  a fairly extensive section, you  will recall, that reviewed  the basis for theCommittee's  focus  on price stability as our longer-term  target.  That section also asserted  acouple of tactical  principles to guide us in the short run:  one was  that we  want to hold the line oninflation;  the other was that we would be  willing to take preemptive  action, if necessary,  to getwhere we  want to go.  I thought then and I do now that the  discussion in that section was  veryhelpful, very constructive,  and I would urge  you as a regular matter, at least for the time  being, tohave  a section like that in your testimony  as a way  of building support for our long-term pricestability  objective and taking us  a further step toward tying down longer-term  inflationexpectations.With respect to the upcoming testimony,  I think this would be an excellent  occasion tomake a couple  of points.  One could be to use this testimony  as an  opportunity to indicate thereally remarkable  degree  of consensus  among central bankers  and professional  economists--which I thought was especially evident at the Jackson  Hole conference--that  long-term pricestability should be the principal goal of monetary  policy.  Also, I think it would be an excellentopportunity to note that this Committee  has been discussing  how to approach  our inflation2/4-5/97objectives  for a couple  of years.  While we are  still  a long  way from  complete  agreement on howthis might be done,  I think we have  achieved  substantial agreement  at least on the  point that,  at  aminimum, we want to conduct  monetary policy in such a way as to hold the line on  inflation.  Ithought there was really a remarkable  degree  of consensus about  that one point at the meeting  ofthis Committee in July.  So  far at  least, I have not sensed  any change  in that general  sentimentthis morning.  I think it would be  appropriate  to try to convey a  clear sense  of the extent andstrength  of this consensus,  if we could.  Beyond that, and here  I am speaking  strictly for myself, Iwould hope  that you might consider taking the additional  step of explicitly defining  the line  weare  trying to hold with a number, specifically  3  percent  on the CPI, as  a way of pre-committingourselves just a little more concretely.In any case, I think making  these points  would help move  us along the road  overwhich  we want  to travel in the long  run.  Our longer-term  strategy obviously must be credible  ifit is going to be  successful.  If it is  going to be credible, it has to have the  strong understandingand support of the Congress  and the public, and  I think your testimony is  obviously  a key vehiclefor building  that understanding  and support.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let  me respond briefly.  I agree  with everything  yousaid, and indeed I will  get to that in later remarks that relate  precisely to this question.  The oneissue that I think we ought  to begin to focus on is  the suitability  of the CPI  as a measure  ofanything.  The  Bureau of Economic Analysis  over at  Commerce has long since  decided that  it isa flawed index,  and in its PCE deflation process  the BEA has deviated  quite  significantly  fromthe structure  of the CPI.  After  spending as much time as  we have in looking at the biases  in theCPI, we have come  to view  this index  as going off on its own.  It is becoming increasingly  apolitical number and less  an economic number.  The reason I say this is  that those who  are2/4-5/97making economic judgments, including  the staff here, are beginning to move away from the CPIas a reliable measure  or goal  of inflation.  So when  we talk about  our price  objectives,  I hope wewill not lock ourselves  into that index.  I do agree that a non-numerical  approach can be toovague and  without merit.  But there is some  approach  in between those  two that seems far moresensible to me as a direction.  That is the reason why a number of years ago  I thought thatdefining price  stability, not in terms of a number but essentially  in terms of expectations  andactions, was a more viable concept.  Obviously,  if we have a  goal other than that, it has to be anumber in  some form.  So, the only area where I disagree  with the thrust of your remarks  is inthe implication that the CPI may be a guiding tool.  I hope that within two years  the  CPI rarelywill be discussed  at these meetings.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I  did not mean to put too much weight on the CPI.I was really trying to emphasize that to the extent we can quantify our inflation  goal that wouldseem to be one more  step in the direction of tying down expectations.  If there is a better numberto use or some  combination  of numbers  to communicate  our inflation  goal as you expressed itthat would be fine.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  My  impression is  that this Committee  has in effect beenfocusing on  a lot of different  price indexes,  and there is a growing consensus  here, as yousuggest, that bringing  inflation down over time  is healthy to the long-term  growth and viabilityof the American economy.  I  agree with that consensus.  As I said, I would be a little  concernedabout getting too explicit in putting out a number publicly.  I do not mind talking about itinternally.  I think  the more explicit  we are  in our discussions, the better, so that we allunderstand exactly where  each one  of us is.  I am a little concerned  about going public even inHumphrey-Hawkins  testimony.  I think we can  address the issue you want addressed, and I agree2/4-5/97that we ought to, without getting too explicit with respect to  a number.  If we  start using anumber,  or any range of numbers,  we will bring out of the woodwork people who want to  getinto what I would consider to be irresponsible  debates  with us.  That would not do us muchharm, but it would take  away from the limited time that we have to do other things.  So, as youknow,  I have  always been very cautious  about releasing a number to the public.This addresses  the issue that Jerry Jordan has been raising as well.  I  do not disagreewith the  concept of a reduction in inflation over time.  It is just that I don't see the advantages  ofputting out a public timetable.  I do not think the evidence  suggests  persuasively that doing  sowould affect the so-called  sacrifice tradeoffs  or any  of the relationships  bearing on our ability tobring the inflation rate down without concurrent  slowing in economic  activity. I think theevidence there is very muddled at best.  We ought to focus on this issue, but I hope that we willnot move in the direction of publishing price range targets with very long lead times.  We wouldhave  great difficulty adhering  to them, and I think they would make  our policy of moving towarda stable price level more  difficult because we would have more political problems  to deal  withalong the way.  I think we would be far better served by not creating  numbers  that we reallycannot lock ourselves into in a realistic manner but could be forced to do so politically if wewere to release them.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Can I make a comment?  As I think all of youknow,  I have been traveling along my  own road to Damascus  on this issue.  I believe thatvirtually every time I speak about anything, I refer  to the theme of price stability, the wonders  ofprice  stability, and its merits  for society.  At a certain  stage of my trip to Damascus,  I thoughtthat it would be  helpful for us to establish publicly  a price range objective.  I have backed offfrom that view over time largely because,  as the Chairman has been suggesting,  I think that it2/4-5/97would lock us into a horrendous political  debate that would not greatly benefit the country  and itwould provide opportunities  for those who really  want to debauch  the currency  to come forwardand have  a  forum in which to make their recommendations.  They  probably would be  of moreconcern,  or so it seems to me, than the people I sometimes  describe  as hairshirts who want togrind inflation down for fear of greater  inflation.  I think the Greenspan definition--that  pricestability is reached when  people are not concerned  about future inflation as they make theirgetting into  a sterile  numbers debate,  and really  getting to the goal  we want to achieve.  Thatcertainly is pragmatism rather than anything disguised as economic  theory.  But having startedwith the notion that we would benefit  from setting a number, not a  specific  number but a range, Inow think that  as a practical  matter doing so could hurt our effort  to achieve  price  stability.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I was just going to comment, Alan, that I understand what you aresaying on the political  side.  On the other side, it seems  fair to say that there  is a rather largeuncertainty premium in real rates with respect to future inflation.  Expectations  of 3 percentinflation seem to be fairly widespread, but my guess is that there is a considerable  amount ofuncertainty  surrounding those expectations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  A 3  percent inflation  rate as  measured by the CPI?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Yes,  I guess that is right.  I'm talking  about surveys;  I believe someof those  surveys  and economists'  projections  are based on the CPI.  But I think there  is a fairlyhigh uncertainty  premium  and some concern  about where we  are going with this.  So, I believethere are some  economic costs  associated with our not being more explicit.  There is  a tradeoff2/4-5/97between  the political risk on the one hand and on the other perhaps some  real economic costsassociated with the  uncertainty  we may cause by not being explicit  about--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The question,  Tom, really  gets down to the issue ofwhat evidence  we have that our making explicit statements  actually  alters that risk premium.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I understand what you said before  about it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think that monetary policy action is what does it.There  is no evidence  in my experience  that words  have had the slightest effect.  It has  not helpedthe Bundesbank,  and if it has not helped the Bundesbank, how is it going to help anybody?  TheBundesbank has  succeeded  because it has taken effective  actions.  It is  what we do, not what wesay, that is going to matter.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  In that regard you probably made  the most significant point bysuggesting that we ought to start with this by being more explicit  among ourselves.  I do notanticipate  having that discussion in the next half hour or hour but in due course here.  It may besomething  we could pursue in anticipation  of the next Humphrey-  Hawkins meeting.  I think thatgetting more  explicit among ourselves would be a  good starting point because  I am not sureeverybody  is on the same page with respect to where we  want to go and how we think we aregoing to get there--over  what time  frame  and so forth.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus  is not raising that.  He is raising, Ithink, a more interesting question.  I think everyone around this table shares essentially the samephilosophical  economic  base.  We all have  the same  view of how the economy functions.  Wehave different  views  as to what is happening,  but nobody here says  that the  best way to getinflation down is to rev up the economy.  That indeed  was once  a view held by a  substantialnumber in the academic  fraternity.  The argument  was that an accelerating  economy brought2/4-5/97down unit costs  and accordingly  brought down prices.  This view is  rarely expressed  these days,and I have never  heard it expressed  around this table.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I do not mean  to suggest that!  All I'm saying is that  I think it wouldbe useful if we were more explicit among  ourselves with respect  to what measures  we ought tobe focusing on, where  we want to get to with those,  and over what time frame.  I think you saidthe same thing.  You had no problem  with our being more explicit with respect to using numbersinternally, but politically you saw a risk in putting  out a number to the public.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes,  I think the more explicit we are internally and themore we discuss this issue among  ourselves, the better.  I can honestly  say that if you asked meto go around the table and make a  speech on this subject  for everyone here  that I could do it.You would be surprised  at how explicit you have  all been.  So, I doubt that the issue is  a lack ofunderstanding  of where we  all stand.  I think we are all pretty clear about who  is where underdifferent circumstances.  No one would dispute where  you are, Tom. [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I wasn't worried  about that.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  could  I make one other brief comment?  I don'twant to push this too hard, and I certainly respect  your views and the views that the ViceChairman  expressed  as well.  I would just make the  point that although the  actions of theBundesbank  are certainly key to their success they  also have a mandate  that I think is part of theequation.  You are right in noting that the empirical  evidence  on the effectiveness  of aprecommitment to price  stability using words  is limited, but the number  of data points is alsolimited.  We really  have not--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I did not say the conclusion  was that it did not work.  Isaid the evidence  of it working is lacking.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Okay, I  was just trying to soften  the conclusions  you draw fromthat point.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I have  a somewhat differentperspective  on the  monetary  aggregate ranges,  and I want to share that with you.  Someonesuggested that the main reason we do not want to raise  the target ranges  is that  raising themwould suggest less vigilance on  our part with respect to inflation.  That is not the way that Iwould make that decision.  I think the real key here is whether we have  more confidence  in thereliability of M2 and its relationship to economic  activity.The important issue here is not just the target range;  the central issue is theinterpretation  of that range.  The way we are interpreting  it today seems very contrary in  myview to  the Humphrey-Hawkins  language.  That language  asks us, I believe, to establish a targetrange  that is relevant  to the current year and that is set in relationship to current  and prospectiveeconomic  developments.  The way we interpret  the current range is that it is relevant  to a period--one  that will perhaps occur  sometime in the future--of price stability with normal velocitybehavior.  The justification  for  such an interpretation  is  very clear, namely, that it does  not makesense to  go back  to our former practice  until we  believe that the relationship  of M2 to economicactivity is more  stable.  That  is the key.  In my view,  were we to reach  a judgment  that theevidence  was now consistent with the emergence  of a more  stable M2 relationship,  we wouldhave to change the interpretation  of the range  that we give in the Humphrey-Hawkins  reports.The range that we should set would  no longer be one that will be relevant  to price stability atsome time in the future.  It should be the range for the  year ahead that we expect  to be consistentwith prospective economic  developments.2/4-5/97If that were the interpretation  that we were willing  to live by for this year, then Iwould say that the  2 to 6 percent  range would make  sense because it is centered  on 4 percent:  2percent trend  growth in real  GDP and  a 2 percent rise in the GDP deflator,  about  where we havebeen.  For those of us who take  an opportunistic perspective,  that is about where we arecomfortable  in being, and that is the sort of signal  we would be  giving.  Now,  I am willing in thenear term to accept what I think is the judgment of the staff, namely, that the period of stabilityin M2 has been too brief to permit a firm evaluation and in particular that stability has not yetbeen what I would call  "stress-tested" by more volatile economic  times  and by variations  inopportunity costs.  However, I think we need to continue  to focus on M2  and to  study itsrelationship  to economic  activity because,  when the evidence  does  suggest that that relationshiphas stabilized,  I do not believe that we will have  an option.  I believe  we will have  a mandate toreturn to the  former interpretation.  And when  we return to that interpretation,  the range that weset will become  relevant.  Right now we never have to change  the range; we never have todiscuss it.  As long as we retain  the current interpretation  of the range, we  never have to discussit.  The  1 to 5 percent  range is centered  basically on  3 percent, including 2 percent real  growthand  1 percent measured  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I am not sure anyone  around here  would disagree  withyour formulation.  I ought to point out,  however, that Humphrey-Hawkins  also requiresunemployment  goals, which used to be discussed by the Administration  and the CEA though Ithink they forgot to do that in  the last couple of reports.  What has  happened  toHumphrey-Hawkins  is that many of the  goals in that  1978 legislation  were  probablyanachronisms  when it was  enacted.  Remember, those who originally drafted that legislationexplicitly took a Friedmanesque view  of money relationships.  They never contemplated2/4-5/97Humphrey-Hawkins  developments  involving the  type of squiggly red line that Brian Madiganshows  in his chart.  Consequently,  for us to fix on a  1978 paradigm that clearly  has proved ratherfaulty in an  historical context raises the  question of whether we  should  slavishly adhere  tosomething that has no legal  force  unless we think it is desirable.  But, clearly, if we  concludethat M2 is  back in play, then I think the way you put it is exactly right.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Humphrey-Hawkins  does not mandate us to do anything;  we just haveto explain why we do not.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I agree  with exactly the way  you formulated  it.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  One  other thing if I might, Mr. Chairman:  There  has been somediscussion  about how explicit we ought  to be  with respect to inflation targets and  inflationranges.  As I have  thought  about this, it has seemed  to me that when we  were very far away  fromwhere we wanted to get, a vaguer definition of price stability was  perfectly adequate.  And infact such a definition was  very desirable because  it meant that we  did not have to sit  down  andworry  whether the appropriate  index was the PCE or the CPI, and we  did not have to worryabout core  or overall  inflation or all those operational  decisions.  But as we get  closer to wherewe want to be,  then at least around  the table,  as  Tom Melzer  suggested, it might  be worthwhilefor us to share  a little more what price stability  means to us because  I think that will help us  tofocus  our deliberations  on where we  are going.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  May  I ask what  is preventing us from doing that?  Isthere anything  in the way we  structure the  meeting that is doing  that?

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  I think in a way there is because in most of our meetings we are  reallyfocused  on a decision about what to do with the  federal  funds rate  for the period between  thatmeeting  and the next meeting and  on a forecast that goes out  one year ahead  and at most two2/4-5/97years ahead.  The decision relating to inflation really does  not come up as  being relevant until wego out over a longer period.  It is only at these two-day meetings  where I think the vehicle  isthere, with our focus  on the longer-term  forecast,  to have more detailed discussions  aboutlong-run  strategy and how we bridge from our short-run  meeting-to-meeting  policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  don't think there is any disagreement  about that, butlet me ask you this.  Does anyone have  any suggestions  as to how  we might alter the structure ofthese meetings to  enhance  that kind of discussion?  I am not aware of anything that is  inhibitingsuch a discussion,  but I want  to make  sure that I am not being blindsided  by something.  ViceChair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I think that we  could make  our meetings  moreof a discussion rather than a series of individual presentations.  On occasion  we discusssomething that a member said.  That has happened more this morning than in quite some time.You said  something;  I along with other members  commented  on it.  We had  a more usefulexchange  of minds and views this morning than  we have had in a while,  and I think that is verygood.  I believe it would be desirable to have a meeting structure that encourages  morediscussion.  Part of it I think also is that the longer people are  here--I have been here about fiveyears now--the more they use shorthand.  Somebody  says something  in about three words,  andthat is actually equivalent  to about six  paragraphs when  we know,  as you said, what everybody'sviews are.

MR. PARRY.  I certainly support the recommendation  for Bluebook alternative  I andbasically  for the  reasons that have  been mentioned.  It seems  to me,  and I would emphasize this,that raising the  ranges would cause unwarranted  focus  on the  aggregates.  I am not confident atthis point that velocity is  sufficiently  stable to warrant  a change  in the ranges.  I also  worry aboutthe possibility that an increase would be misinterpreted in terms of our resolve  to achieve pricestability.  So, I strongly  favor alternative  I.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Just to add a footnote  to the earlier discussion  about being explicit:We really have a remarkably  good track record  over the last  15  years,  and I think that trackrecord is based on  a good combination of solid economics  and pragmatism.  It is not just the15-year record;  we have a good 5-year  record,  a good  1-year record.  As we go forward,  I thinkwe need to be very cautious  about changing the mix of what has made us successful  in the past.We may need to do that, but inflation  has come down, we have not had many explicit debatesabout what the  number ought to be,  and I think we have done  it with deeds.  This is one of thoseissues on which  a full-scale debate could be good in an ideal  sense.  But this is also one of thosetopics that easily can be demagogued,  and  we  can get thrown  off for not very substantivereasons.  So,  I would be cautious about changing what has worked for us for a long period oftime and has brought  us  so much success.  In sum, I am generally  sympathetic,  Mr. Chairman,  toyour mix of good economics and pragmatism that has led us to this point.  It is encouraging  tome going forward, and I think we probably are  going to achieve  more success  over the next fewyears.On the specific  issue at hand, I find Brian's exhibit  1 on the velocity of M2 veryencouraging  with regard to the potential future  usefulness of M2 in monetary policy.  But it is2/4-5/97really just that--encouraging  about  potential future  usefulness.  We ought to continue  to watchM2, but whatever decision  we need to make in the next few  months  about monetary policywould be easier to make if it were not cluttered  by M2, which  is not all that secure  a foundation.So, I support alternative I.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I, too,  support alternative I for the reasons that have  been cited,  and I donot have anything  to add there.  But let me  comment a little on a couple  of other issues.First, with regard to a more explicit inflation target  that we would go public with, Iwould tread very cautiously in that direction  and not just because  of the political  risks that havebeen identified.  I  also see  operational  and economic  risks.  What I am referring to is the risk ofannouncing  an  objective that, of course, we would  be obligated to try to achieve.  In my view,which  is supported by some work  done at our Bank, that could result in serious instrumentinstability  and have  adverse  consequences  for the real economy  unless we  are very careful  abouthow we spell  out what we intend to do.  That suggests  the need  for a proposal  that we  havethought through very  carefully,  and I have  not seen  such a proposal. I do not believe  we havedone the  analysis that would be required.My second comment relates to the question  of whether we can have  more of thesekinds of discussions.  What I would suggest may not be  quite as diplomatic  as most of thediscussion  around this table, but I believe that  what turns  out to be  a rehash  of the Beigebook atthe beginning of our economic  discussions  could be shortened  or dispensed  with so that we couldspend most of our time discussing  what  I would describe as more fundamental policy issues.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me just say something that came to mind yesterdayafternoon.  I read the Beigebook, and I listened to  the discussion around this table.  They are two2/4-5/97strength  and associated  inflationary pressures  than appeared  in the last Beigebook.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Well, my suggestion  would be that we not dispense  with our Districtreports altogether, but I think we could highlight things that are  different  or outliers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me tell you this.  I don't know whether I can speakfor the  rest of us on the Board, but I can surely  speak for myself.  I  find the individual reportsand interpretations  of what is  going on in your Districts to be new information  that is notavailable either in the Beigebook  or elsewhere.  I would be  very reluctant  to suggest that youdiscontinue  making those  reports because  we will then end up with an  academic  discussion abouthow to conduct  policy, and we  will have fewer facts and more concepts.  [Laughter]  I am notterribly certain  that that  would improve  the balance.  So, if it turns  out that  we need morediscussion,  I think we should put it on as  a separate element.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  All right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If any of you have particular  ideas that you want to puton the table for discussion,  let us  know.  There is no reason why members  of this Committeecannot present  specific ideas they think are relevant.  We can lay it out as part seminar.  The restof us can discuss it.  And as the Vice Chair says, that will lead to other things.  There is no needfor us to maintain the existing structure that we observe at each meeting.  On  occasion  we arevery constrained by time;  at other meetings  we are not.  If somebody had told me that I had tofinish by  10:00 a.m. today, looking at the  agenda that we have for this morning, I bet you wecould have done it.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  At the risk of proving  your point here,  [laughter]  let me just say that Iagree with you  on the alternatives.  With regard to the issue raised in our earlier discussion,  I tooam  a little nervous  about picking  an inflation number and target path.  That's not because  Iwouldn't like to see lower inflation  happen, but I see problems.  I noticed  in this  morning'sdiscussion  that we had at least two  interpretations  of the monetary  aggregate  ranges within thisgroup.  And if we went outside of this room, the number of meanings would be multiplied byhowever  much.  We would have  the same problem with inflation  targets.  In other words, whenan event occurs,  does it mean the same  thing to me as  it does to you?  I think we  could begintalking about some of the wrong things in an environment  reminiscent  of the debate about howmany angels  can dance on the head of a pin.  I want  to be very careful  about that because  I sensethat right now we are  migrating  from the CPI to the PCE.  We have not really  discussed thatissue but we appear to be  migrating  there.  So, a 2 percent inflation  rate  may mean  somethingdifferent now as  we migrate.  That is why I  am cautious  about picking numbers.  For me, theinflation number is zero whatever the measure,  and then it matters what affects  us in movingeither toward  or away  from that  number, whatever  the measure.  I think that is what we have tokeep in front of us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is the issue Mike Moskow  was  raising yesterdayabout the CPI.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I think so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I favor adopting the provisional  ranges, which is alternative  I.2/4-5/97On the issue you raised about  whether there  is anything impeding these discussionsor what we could do to foster them, it seems  to me that it would be  very useful  to ask FOMCstaff--Board and Bank staff--to research the  issue Tom Hoenig  was just talking about.  Perhapsthey could take  a look at the  various measures  and lay out for us some  of the pros and cons  of themeasures, indicate  what might constitute  price stability in their view,  and--I don't know if this ispossible--what  might constitute price  stability in one  measure versus  another to the extent thatbiases  can be identified.  I think that would be  a useful  starting point in terms  of sharpening ourinternal focus.  If we tended to gravitate  toward a measure that seemed to make  sense  to usinternally  and we had a clearer  idea in our minds as to what would constitute price stability underthat measure, forgetting  what the time frames might be or whether we would get theresystematically  or opportunistically,  that would be a good  starting point  for a discussion  at one  ofthese meetings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  I also prefer staying with  the provisional  ranges  and getting there bythe left leg of Brian's  tree that we talked about.  After sitting at this table for a year and  workingthrough the short-term options meeting  after meeting,  I guess I have  gravitated toward wishingfor a better sense  and a crisper  view of our collective long-term  strategy.  So, I am glad to hearthat kind  of discussion.One other comment about our external  constituencies:  I don't know about the rest ofyou, but  I have been running into more  and  more complacency  among business groups, includingdirectors,  with regard to inflation.  I think our success has left people feeling that we have wonthe war against  inflation.  All the  debate in the  last few months about  the reconstruction  of theCPI has undermined  the arguments  for an anti-inflationary  policy even more.  People are  not sure2/4-5/97that they know, or even that we know, where we are with respect to inflation, though there is afeeling  that we are  probably better off now than earlier.  That attitude certainly makes  it harder tosell the notion of pushing inflation still  lower by 1/2  or 1 percentage  point.  So, I would arguethat we have the ongoing job of doing whatever we can--and  whatever you  can, Mr. Chairman--to sharpen the external  understanding  of our focus on inflation.  There is an awful  lot ofcomplacency,  at least  in the groups  I talk to.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  In fact,  as I am  going to note explicitly in remarks  that Iwill make later,  I find that complacency  very nervous-making  and in particular  its reflection  inthe sharp narrowing of junk bond yield spreads against Treasuries,  the level of equity premiumsin the stock market, and various  relationships that one can infer from the financial  structure.That's because, unlike  anecdotal information,  which is  often difficult to replicate over time, wehave these  series going back into the  1920s,  and we have  seen these  patterns move up  and downand up and  down.  Human nature being the only constant throughout,  one begins to suspect whenwe run into a period such  as this that it is not a new Nirvana.  It is not  even an  old Nirvana,  and itwill change.  The trouble unfortunately  is that when the change  occurs,  it too often occursabruptly and that  is something  we have to be terribly concerned  about.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the proposal to retainalternative  I.  I do think, in terms  of full Humphrey-Hawkins  disclosure,  that we  should expandthe discussion in the Humphrey-Hawkins  report  and indicate  that we think M2 and M3  growththere has been  a return to a normal relationship between GDP and money growth.  So, I think  weshould keep  that discussion  open.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We have  to because  we considered  that.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  The other thing I wanted to mention is that I also, like you,  find thediscussions  of District developments  at these  meetings  very useful, though others  may feel thatthey are a rehash of the Beigebook.  I do think that we could relate what we see in each  of ourindividual corners  of the world to inflation  and various measures  of inflation  either as a separatediscussion  or as part of our initial economic go-around.  And I would  like to  see a broaderdiscussion of the various  measures  of inflation and how we think some  of them are progressing.We have  had a lot of changes--going  to chain weights,  for example.  In addition,  there are thearguments  to be considered  about the reliability of the CPI and how it should be measured.  A lotof shifting is occurring now in these various  measures  of inflation,  and I think it would be usefulfor us to get back to a fundamental  discussion of that.  As for commodity  prices, I understandthat the world does not depend on corn prices,  but for some people that is quite important.  Ithink  an analysis  of some  of those basic relationships  and how they feed through from the initialcommodity  prices, or gold for that matter, to final prices  would be useful.  In sum, it would begood  for us to get back to basics.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I also favor no change in the ranges for the reasons that  you gave,Mr. Chairman.  We certainly  do not want to give the M's too much external  play nor to give theimpression that  we are once again targeting  any of them.  On the other hand, not only do I thinkwe should be watching them more  internally than I believe  we have been lately,  I also believethat we should make occasional  references  to them publicly along with other things so that theydo not die out in the public mind.  It helps  greatly  in the rhetoric when  tightening becomesnecessary to be able to say we are having to tighten because  the monetary  aggregates  aregrowing  at an  inflationary  rate.  That sounds  a lot better than saying that we have to tighten2/4-5/97because  the economy  is growing and because  employment is growing and unemployment is toolow.  So, money is  a very useful  thing to have  in our tool kit,  and we ought to keep  it before  thepublic--we  have to "use it or lose it."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  As  soon as we  start to use it in that context, then whenM2 starts to grow  at a far slower rate, though  we may not think that means anything,  we have putit in play and the devil will come back to collect his dues.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I think there  is a difference,  though,  between hanging  your hat on itand merely keeping it alive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think we ought to keep it alive,  and I agree  with thatidea.  If indeed we  gain confidence  in M2,  then we should be willing to allow monetary  policy toreflect our evaluations  of what is happening to money.  We could conceivably  tighten if M2growth is perceived  to be excessive and  ease if it is looking  to be--

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I doubt that we  will end up tightening today,  but if we were to doso,  I think that one  of the  main reasons would be that M2  growth is at the upper end of its rangeright now.  In my view that is  as good a reason  as any of the other reasons that I could list. Iwould feel more comfortable with that than I would doing it on the basis of wage-cost pushinflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I will tell you that if the reason is that the labor marketsare getting too tight and wage increases  are accelerating,  there  is a very large section of thepopulation who would say,  "Isn't that wonderful!"  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly support alternative  I.  The  reasons havebeen well discussed  and I don't have anything  to add.2/4-5/97It may be redundant but I would like to add the following:  It seems  to me that we  areentering  a new era of appropriate  intellectual  focus in all our concerns  here.  I think we have  hadthe first airing of it this morning that I can recall.  For the last decade  or so, we have been in theprocess  of trying to work  inflation down in an orderly manner, and that has been  our entire focus.What are the appropriate  ways to do that?  We certainly  have not yet  fully achieved pricestability, but I do think that we are now beginning to enter a zone where  our focus should shift alittle, and we should  start to think in terms of how to maintain  ourselves in that zone  over timeonce we  begin to get in it.  I would like to see some staff work  and see us begin to have  somedialogue  on such questions  as what price  indices we  should be targeting or what combination  ofindices.  As someone  asked,  what are  the appropriate  levels of those indices  given themethodologies  involved in their construction?  At what levels  of these  indices  can we feelcomfortable that we are  achieving  what we want to achieve?  If zero is where we would becomfortable,  that would have to imply that there  are some deflationary  tendencies  in somesectors  of the eonomy.  How  do we feel  about those and the impact they might have on theeconomy?  How do we deal with an upward  drift in inflation?  Do we accommodate  some  of it ordo we hit it over the head instantly when we  are already in  a zone of price level  stability,however defined?  These  are the kinds of questions that I do not think we have faced before,  andthat we start to do some work in that area.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  A very good idea.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  If you wait long enough to talk at these  meetings, others  havealready  said everything  that you planned  to say.  I think Mike Kelley hit on exactly  the rightformulation here.  We may be closer than we know to a maintenance  situation that has its ownset of difficulties.  These  difficulties  differ perhaps  from those that the Committee  faced  earlier,particularly  in the  1980s,  in its efforts to rein in inflation.  That is  especially true of thedifficulties on the political  side that you  referred to in one way or another, Mr. Chairman, inmany of your comments.  I, too, would be very much  in favor of a fuller discussion of what weare measuring  and what it is we are talking about when  we discuss inflation.  We all know  thatwe  do not want inflation  to go up, but I am not sure that we know what the rate of inflation iscurrently--or  at least I know that  I do not know exactly what it is.  How do we translate  that veryuseful  concept of yours of not having inflation be part of economic  decision-making  intosomething specific  that we  can watch over time  and anticipate  over time?  Maybe we have tohave those  discussions outside of a meeting,  as we have before.  In any event, I believe  we needto do something  along the lines that Mike Kelley discussed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I guess I am  a little out of step with the way the issue is being definedin this discussion because  my first choice would be not to announce target  ranges  at all and toexplain why not.  Concurrent Resolution  133 and Humphrey-Hawkins  were both adopted  in anenvironment  where,  even in the economics  profession,  there was no consensus about ourobjectives.  So,  the purpose was to constrain  the central bank's activities  and reduce one sourceof uncertainty.  To continue  to announce  a target  range for an aggregate,  I think, actually  hindersits use in the formulation of policy.  It  would be a mistake to resurrect  money as  an objective  orgive the  sense that any  money measure  is something that triggers  a change in the  funds rate.  I2/4-5/97think it was Herb  Stein who once  said,  "It is certainly  true that there is a stable relation betweenmoney and the price level; what is not stable  is the definition of money."  If we were to get backinto a situation  where people thought that our actions were being triggered  by M2 or any othermoney measure,  we would have  the Goodhart's  law problem  or what Henry  Wallich called theHeisenberg principle of people focusing on an instrument in drawing  conclusions about ouractions.  This alters people's behavior and therefore  changes  the relationship between  thatinstrument and economic  activity.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think Heisenberg would  not have approved  of thatapplication  of his principle!

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I think that this is the time, whether it is in your Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony in a couple  of weeks or not, to start to try to get money out of there.  The legislationdoes not require that we  announce any particular money measure--M1,  M2, or anything  else.  Itsays  something broadly about monetary  aggregates.  I think we  could try to explain  that usingsomething  like money growth to formulate policy to achieve our objective  of price stability isone  thing; setting it out there publicly  as a target on  an annual or even multiyear basis, I think,would be a mistake.  I do not know  how hard that would be to explain  to members of Congress,but we could just tell them that we are not going  to announce  target ranges  anymore because theymiscommunicate  our policy  intentions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It has always been  the case that if we had newlegislation to replace Humphrey-Hawkins,  I do not think we would necessarily  be pushing fortarget ranges.  We would think that something else would be more relevant  to what we would bedoing.  President Moskow.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I agree with  alternative I.  If we did change theranges, I think that would be  interpreted as  a change in policy  and we really are not making achange in policy.  No matter how  sophisticated our explanation,  I believe  it would still beinterpreted  as  a change  in policy.On some  of the other topics that have been mentioned  here,  I do think there  are acouple of topics that it would be useful  for us to discuss.  One, the idea of different  measures  ofinflation  and  different targets  for inflation using those measures,  I would find very  useful.  As Imentioned yesterday,  I am concerned that the  CPI and the  core CPI are being severely criticizednow  as measures.  We all know there  are  biases in those  measures  and in addition BLS  is in theprocess of making technical  adjustments to them.  All that obfuscates  what the real target is.  Ithink looking  at a number of different  inflation measures  would be  very useful for thisCommittee,  and developing  our own internal  targets on those would be helpful as well.  At leastwe would know  within the Committee which  direction we wanted to move as  a Committee.The second issue that I believe  it would be useful  for us to discuss is how to get toprice stability.  We have talked  in the past about opportunistic  approaches  and other types ofapproaches.  That type of discussion has  been very helpful  because I don't think any of us issatisfied in staying at the current  level of inflation.  We want to lower inflation, and  it is not clearto me how we are going  to accomplish that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There seems  to be close to, if not full, unanimity onalternative I.  As a consequence  of that, I would not differentiate  between the M2, M3,  and debtaggregates, but I would assume that all  the ranges  need to stay where they are.  So, I think thesimplest procedure  would be for a reading of a directive  that would encompass that.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The wording is on page 21  of the Bluebook:  "The Federal  Openpromote  sustainable  growth in output.  In furtherance  of these objectives,  the Committee  at thismeeting  established ranges  for growth of M2 and M3  of 1 to  5  percent and  2 to 6 percentrespectively, measured  from the  fourth quarter of 1996 to the  fourth quarter of 1997.  Themonitoring range  for growth of total domestic nonfinancial  debt was set at 3  to 7 percent for theyear.  The behavior of the  monetary aggregates  will continue to be evaluated  in the  light ofprogress toward price  level stability, movements  in their velocities, and developments  in theeconomy  and financial  markets."

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman,  could I ask a question?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Certainly.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Will the report include the  sentence that has appeared  in the lastseveral  reports that these  ranges are interpreted  as  a benchmark  associated with price  stabilityand normal  velocity?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Do you mean in the  minutes or the testimony?

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  In the testimony.  How do we interpret these ranges  because  that isnot in the paragraph  that was read?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I would assume that we would do it the same  way wedid it the last time.  The minutes  would also indicate  what that means.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We  shall now move  on to current monetary policy andthe domestic  policy directive.  I call  on Don Kohn.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Don, if I were to paraphrase  one  of the  first sentences in your briefing,it would  say that the present stance of policy is too easy to contain  inflation.  With  that as abackground,  I would like  you to explain to me what  opportunism  calls for at this point.[Laughter]  It seems to me  that if your  assertion is true  and given  the way opportunism wasexplained to me earlier,  under conditions where we see inflation  as likely to rise, we would takeaction.  I am a little confused.  Have we modified  the definition  of opportunism?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  No, we have not.  I think the question becomes  one  of how muchconfidence  the Committee  or the  Committee  member involved has in  this projection thatinflation  will pick up.  This is a forecast  and there  is a range of uncertainty  around it.  It is truethat under an  opportunistic  strategy,  there would be an  inclination to lean  very hard againsttendencies  for inflation to pick up and less  hard against shortfalls.  So, I do not think we  havemodified  the definition.  If an opportunistic  Committee member became  convinced with  some2/4-5/97degree of confidence  that, in fact, policy was too easy, that member would need to vote for achange to be within this somewhat arbitrary  definition of what opportunism means.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  So, pursuing the current  policy would require  me as an  opportunist tosay that I just do not buy the forecast?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think it would mean that you would have  sufficient  uncertainty aboutthe  forecast  and a sense that  it was desirable  to wait a while to  get more information,  particularlygiven  some of the factors we  have talked about that will be holding down overall inflation andprobably inflation expectations  this year.  You would have to weigh the costs  and benefits ofwaiting to obtain more information, given your degree  of confidence  in that forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  There certainly is  a danger in  doing that.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The cost of waiting would be that in  the event  of some  upcreep ininflation  and inflation  expectations  and given  the lags in policy, you would have to induce moreslack in the economy to keep  inflation at the current level.  The benefit would be that if you hadacted sooner on an  incorrect  forecast, you would have put some  slack in the economy  and causedsome variations  in output that were unnecessary  to meet  your objectives as  an opportunisticpolicymaker.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Don, we  have  had only one issue  of inflation  indexed bonds,  but arethere  any preliminary  conclusions you could draw from that or is it premature to do so?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think it is premature.  As a general  matter, the bonds were,  as youknow,  in greater demand  and better received  than most people thought they would be.  I thinkthere is still uncertainty  in the market  about how to trade them,  what they should be trading2/4-5/97against, and what we as  analysts  should be comparing  them to try to intuit what the difference  is.We have done  some analysis  here that  was  shared in the Board briefings that you  all havereceived.  The analysis  suggested that the bonds could trade  like a floating  rate note if all theshocks were inflation  shocks, but they would trade more  like a 12-year bond or a note  with thatduration  if all the  shocks  were real  shocks.  My understanding  is that in the UK they trade  morelike a shorter-term  security than a longer-term  security.  We would have to get more  experienceand  hopefully over time have  trading occurring at more than one maturity to be able to analyzethe behavior of these bonds in our market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Don, you mentioned in your very good  asalways presentation  that there may be some questioning  as to whether we are  still in thepreemptive  monetary policy business or at least we are beginning  to get those  questions.  Myown feeling  from looking at the behavior of the markets  and being in New York  and thereforehaving  a nonstop opportunity  to talk to the people in the markets  is that such questioning is  stillvery tentative,  if it has in fact begun.  The people who think monetary policy  can never be tightenough have always been  worried about us.  Those who never find monetary policy looseenough would, of course, be delighted if we got out of the preemptive  business.  But I think thatthe vast range of more serious  people in the  middle is still giving us  the benefit  of the doubt.  Iam not sure how much.  That is a wasting asset, I suspect.  My interpretation  is that it is an assetthat we  still have  in rather large  supply.  Do you have  a different view?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I dont fundamentally  disagree  with your analysis.  I  guess I wasmotivated  in part by my own concerns,  and I did not have any good answers  about how theCommittee would  act preemptively,  particularly in a situation where  we had  a slow, steady2/4-5/97upcreep  in inflation and  some  market commentary  that, because  of the uncertainties,  we wouldneed the so-called  smoking gun  in order to tighten.  But I agree with you that it is not thepredominant  market commentary  now.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  It sounds  as if you would agree that there is  awasting  asset quality.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Our assessment  of the market's interpretation  of us, this looking-in-the-mirror question,  has become  more complicated  over the last few  years because  you folkshave done  such a good job.  When you  do not tighten monetary  policy, people  say the FOMCmust know something that they do not know--that  the underlying inflation  pressures  are not asintense as they might have thought was  the case. It is very  hard to sort out the effect of youractions on their expectations  of the underlying inflation  pressures from their reading of whatyour intentions  are and whether  you would act preemptively.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I  agree with that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for Don?

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Don, have  you run any simulations,  other than those reported in theBluebook, with NAIRU  specified at some lower  level, perhaps the 5.3  percent rate that we havebeen at for some time?  Even if you have not, do you have  any  sense about  how sensitive theinflation path is to some lower NAIRU?

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is  there  anything else?  Let me  get started by beginningwith the bottom line and working backwards.  My uppermost concern  is the emergence  ofgradual, drip-by-drip  inflation pressures.  As  Governor  Kelley said the other day, there is noentry point where we can say conclusively  that we  should be tightening, yet  we may find at theend of the day that the inflation  dragon  has nibbled us to death.One of the reasons that I raised the  irrational expectations  issue earlier  was in responseto Jack Guynn's discussions with his colleagues and  constituents  about the sense  of tranquilityout there, which history tells us is to be looked at with a good  deal  of trepidation.  I do not thinkthat we have reason to move today because I do think, as I will get to in a minute, that inflationpressures  are  quite contained at this moment.  But I think we  are getting  to the point--March  maybe the appropriate  time--when  we will have to move unless very  clear evidence  emerges  that theexpansion  is easing  significantly.  I don't mean  evidence that GDP growth is moderating  to  1-3/4percent or whatever the  forecast is.  The GDP is a nice number and it does have  somerelationship  to the real world.  I'm not terribly certain  what it is,  though everyone  tells me  itdoes.The types  of things I would  be looking for are indications that orders were  flattening,capacity pressures  clearly  were easing, and we had at least sporadic reports  around this table  thatlabor market tightness,  the crucial issue that is related  to everything  we have been  talking about,was beginning  to show  signs of letting up.  We  have not seen  such indications  yet, and if wedon't, I would think that  in the Humphrey-Hawkins  report we  would not only underscore  ourintention to hold the line on  inflation and to take  preemptive  action as needed,  which AlBroaddus  was talking about, but we  would have to prime the markets  to anticipate  that we mightbe moving  quite soon  even in the absence  of clear evidence of upward  movements  in wage or2/4-5/97price inflation.  We would take such action largely as  an insurance  premium, which we haveraised in other contexts.  How that warning would or should be constructed,  I do not  yet know.  Ido remember that in the latter months of  1993 and  especially in January  1994, I felt  as though  Iwas getting up on the table, jumping up and  down  and screaming,  "Hey, we are about  to raiserates."  I did it three more  times, and I said,  "Hey, hey."  [Laughter]  We finally raised  rates by25 basis points  on February 4th and the markets  asked,  what did you do, where did that comefrom?  I don't know  whether or not we can  condition  markets that do not wish to be conditionedabout changes  in policy, but I do think we have  an  obligation to indicate in advance of our movewhy we are moving.  The old notion that we will explain what we did three weeks after the factin Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony strikes me as  wholly inconsistent with how long it takes  theworld to turn.  It is far better to  say in advance  what we are going to do and why than  the otherway around.Having looked  at the data, I must say that the general consensus  around  this  tableseems to reflect  a bit more concern  about  an imminent  acceleration  of inflationary  pressures  thanI think the  data are  telling us.  There is no doubt  that the wage  drift is up.  The question  is howmuch is it up relative to what  historical relationships  have indicated  it should have been.  I thinkwe  are all acutely  aware that the tracking of either  the ECI or what I would call adjusted  averagehourly earnings,  which  attempt to adjust for industry  employment  shifts and overtime,  shows anupdrift but not one that squares with our usual wage/price Phillips  curves, for example.  Indeed,if we assume that the ECI wage/price Phillips curve has  been exactly  on target, meaning  theactual and calculated  wage  inflation rates  have been equal, but we  let the NAIRU  fall out as theresidual unknown,  solving for the  NAIRU  gives us a number  well under 5 percent.2/4-5/97Now, I don't consider that an especially  relevant piece of information because,  as Ihave been saying over the  last year and a half, I think a very special  event unique to thisparticular  business cycle  is governing what we are observing, namely, the  wage-change/job-insecurity tradeoff factor.  This essentially  stipulates that the rise in wages  will be less thanhistorically expected  because of the markedly increased concern  about job layoffs  and thatsmaller-than-expected  wage  gains will convert to higher profit margins.  That in turn  will make itvery difficult for a firm to raise its prices because profits  are  more than adequate  at lower prices,thereby  prompting  other competitors  to undercut  the higher prices  and increase  market share.So, I think the argument  is that job insecurity  affects  wages  and in turn prices, and that is theprocess  keeping  inflation down.  All the evidence  at this  stage, while not conclusively  affirmingthat model,  at least does  not contradict  it.  Indeed,  surveys by one organization  have askedemployees  of large corporations  if they were  afraid of being laid off.  In  1991,  at the bottom ofthe business  cycle, 25 percent of those  surveyed by that organization  said they were.  In  1995,  itwas 46 percent despite  the sharp intervening decline in the unemployment  rate.  And I might saythat  the more recent data for  1996  show it unchanged  at 46 percent.  We  also observe  that,contrary  to historical relationships, the number  of people who voluntarily  leave jobs, becomeunemployed,  and  seek new employment--a  proxy measure of the quit rate--has remained  steady,not terribly far from where it was a number  of years  ago, despite  the fact  that it should have risensignificantly  if past relationships with the unemployment  rate had prevailed.With regard to the structure of costs  and prices,  I grant that the data  are not terriblyuseful  in certain respects, but I want to point out to you what is indicated by BEA's figures  forunit costs  and profits of nonfinancial  corporations,  with our own very rough estimates  for thefourth quarter filled in.  The prices  that BEA  uses to deflate  gross corporate  product are2/4-5/97somewhat  arbitrary, but our evaluation based on  more sophisticated  price deflators  does notfundamentally  change  their result.  In any event, the result for the last  half of 1996  is that  theestimated  implicit price  deflator for the gross  domestic  product of the nonfinancial  corporatesector is unchanged, meaning  the price  change  is zero.  The estimated change  in unit labor costsover the two-quarter period  is zero.  Of course,  unit nonlabor costs plus profits,  whichincidentally  take up approximately  one-third  of total  sector income,  are  also zero.  Thesenumbers clearly have  a range  of error that is not inconsiderable.  We  also have  to remember  thatthis is  a cost evaluation  from the income  side, not the product side.  So, the productivity  gainsimplicit in these  data are  larger than the ones  we are  getting in  the official  data.  The one thingwe know  about the  official data on productivity  is that they are  wrong.  There  are  weaknessesassociated with using the income side  of the national income  accounts  data, but segregatingnonfinancial  corporations  from unincorporated  business  and financial corporations  gives us  a farbetter insight into the underlying  wage/price  structure.  What  is involved here is that nonlaborunit costs plus  profits have been  little changed  for a while,  and since  they account  for a third oftotal  costs, it would require  some  significant  movement  in unit labor costs to get prices moving.Having said all  of that, I do not seriously believe  that this pattern  can  hold very muchlonger.  I think we  are getting to the point where it is just not credible  to believe  that workermotivations  in labor negotiations  are  leading to a continued  shift from  wage gains  to job securityin labor contracts.  We  need to remember  that it is not  a requirement to get the old inflation-accelerating  process  to resume to have  the wage-change/job-security  effect return to where  itwas.  All that is required  is for the rate of decline  in relative  wage gains to slow, and it has toslow  at  some point.  I said that a year ago  and,  to repeat what Larry  Meyer said in a differentform,  I am saying  it again.  The  fact that it has  not happened  is merely  an  indication of how2/4-5/97powerful  this force  is in containing inflation.  Therefore,  I have  not felt,  and I do not at thismoment feel,  that there is  a particular urgency about  our moving.  But it seems very questionableto allow the last 20 percent of this process,  or whatever the percentage  is, to play  itself outwithout taking some  form of preemptive  action  sooner rather than later.  I don't know that Iwould put it in the terms  that you did,  Bill, when you  raised the  possibility that our credibility  isa wasting asset.  But something  of that nature has to be there.Another aspect  of the current environment  is  that the financial  markets  look just toobenign.  I do not care what equity price  model one uses;  the  simple model says that there  is asingle discount rate over an  indefinite period  and a constant  growth rate  is implied in the  currentlevel of stock prices.  Then  it is an algebraic  necessity  that the  dividend-price ratio or theearnings-price  ratio be exactly  equal to the riskless rate  of interest plus the nominal equitypremium of stock yields  over riskless  rates minus  the growth rate of either earnings  or dividendsand some  factor for a payout ratio  if the earnings  approach is used.  We know the earnings-priceratio and the riskless interest rate, and therefore we know  the difference  between  the nominalequity premium and the rate of growth.  Incidentally, they may be  defined in either real ornominal  terms; it doesn't matter because  the  inflation level cancels  out of that relationship.  Weare looking at a rate of earnings  growth that is very  significantly  above  what is implicit in ournominal  GDP forecasts.  Indeed, in yesterday's  Chart Show Mike Prell had a chart in which  theI/B/E/S three- to five-year earnings  forecast  was rising very  sharply, with the  rate of growthsomething like  12-3/4 percent per annum over  a five-year horizon.  Since we cannot infer  anysignificant drift between the  S&P 500  earnings  and the NIPA economic  earnings, we have  animplicit expectation  of a continued  rise in profit margins.  Is  it inconceivable?  No.  Could ithappen?  It  could.  Is it probable?  I would not want  to bet the ranch.  If the earnings estimate  is2/4-5/97high, we have  a sufficiently  high equity premium,  which puts that number somewhere  in therange  of recent history  and not particularly out of line.  If, however,  we lower  the earningsestimate, we also have to bring down the  earnings  premium and then that falls  very  significantlybelow any credible  recent history, including  1987.  This then  means the market  is overvalued  inthat regard.  I grant Abby Cohen her little relationship,  and I wish her well.  I hope she spendsher bonus, which I gather is very substantial this  year, prudently.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  We can  certainly assume that it is verysubstantial.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If I were  allowed to invest in the  market, which theydo not allow  around here,  I don't think I would  be doing  so very  forcefully!  It is  that type ofthing plus the various  risk  spreads, which  are really  quite narrow  and have been that way forquite a while, that  suggest that product prices  alone should not be the  sole criterion  if  we aregoing to maintain a stable,  viable financial  system whose fundamental  goal, let us remember,  isthe attainment  of maximum sustainable  economic growth.  It is the real economy that matters.Finance  is all very interesting  and financial  prices  are quite  important but only because  theyaffect the real  economy.  Ultimately,  that is what  our charter is all about.We have to  start thinking  about some  form of preemptive  move  and how tocommunicate  that in  a credible manner.  I would  not be  inclined to do anything  today.  Indeed,were  we to tighten policy now,  I think we would really shock the market in  a way that would bequite  destabilizing and would  not advance  our goals.  I don't think there  is a particular urgencyhere.  I don't think we  are  getting any evidence  in the  underlying price  structure  or on thecommodity  side that there is  any pressure pushing  through.  It is not clear that wage  growth,whatever it is, is significantly  exceeding  productivity increases  in the real  world.  As a2/4-5/97consequence,  the evidence  of a rise in unit labor  costs at rates that suggest  that it is eating intoprofit margins is not  confirmed by  any of the data of which I am  aware.  Indeed,  the earningsforecasts for  1997 by Wall Street  analysts show increases  that are  consistent with rising profitIn  short, I can  see no credible evidence  of increasing  price pressures.  And eventhough  I listened to anecdotal  reports  of price pressures  around the table yesterday,  you were alltalking  about parts of your regional  economies.  I would  suspect that  if we  had real data  and did  afull-blown  evaluation  of unit costs,  the paradigm  shift that Cathy Minehan  mentioned,  movingfrom preventing rising  supplier prices  to actually nudging  them down,  would turn out to be farmore prevalent  than I believe people  realize.  So,  I think  our policy implementation  has to takeaccount  of a very complex  set of considerations.  I think we  ought to reflect them as best we  canin our Humphrey-Hawkins  report and be prepared to move if we have to at the next  meeting.  Iam not saying that we necessarily  should.  I am just saying that we have to be  careful about  theinflation  dragon's nibbling capabilities,  which I mentioned  before,  and that is what reallyconcerns  me  above all.  If we make  this  an issue  at the Humphrey-Hawkins  hearing and  theeconomy  eases enough  so that no  move is dictated,  I don't  think it would do particularly  muchdamage  to monetary policy.  If it turns out that we get surprised  by a quick  acceleration  ofinflation,  which means that  we have been somewhat behind  the curve,  at least our monetarypolicy choice  will be unambiguous.  The most  likely outcome  is in the middle with the dragonlurking there,  and he makes me very nervous.  As  a consequence,  I would argue for staying at"B"  today but with an asymmetry that is unlike that at the previous  couple  of meetings.  There isno reason to change  it, but it is  a real asymmetry  as I see it at this time.  Vice Chairman.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I fully endorse  therecommendation  you have  made, and  I will try to fill in the gap while others  prepare  for the popquiz on your evaluation  of the equity market.  I also think the asymmetry really is quite  differentbecause  I now read it as meaning that we  will tighten  soon and probably  at the March  meeting.  Ibelieve  we would  wish to  do so later than that only if the  incoming information  suggested greaterweakness  than  we are likely to have,  which will be the payback in the first quarter  for a verystrong fourth quarter.  I think we would have to convince ourselves that the  slowdown  is moremeaningful  than one that just reflects that payback.In the  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony, I think it is very important that  you prepare  theway and explain to  the world, both the market  and the public more generally,  what is likely to becoming.  I think that market participants  are more likely to get the message this time, largelybecause they did not get it the last time.  They do tend to learn from that kind of experience.  Inwhat I think is the  remote possibility of their not  getting it, we might have  to decide how  weshould  make the message  a little clearer.  Since  I make it an art form of not saying  things thatmove markets, perhaps  I could be of use in that regard by enhancing  what you  said or even justquoting it to help bring more  attention to it.Going to the message  in the Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony,  I think we should hitsome themes rather strongly, and you suggested  all of them:  Another theme is that our goal isprice stability  and that is how  we achieve  sustained economic  growth.  That at the  very highcapacity  usage the economy  is experiencing,  potential noninflationary  growth is really limited, aswe  all know, to the sum of the growth of the labor force and the  growth of productivity.  Wecould remind them that monetary policy in that environment can hurt sustained economic  growthif it stays too accommodative  too long and that we simply do not have  the capability to produce2/4-5/97higher real  growth through  an overly accommodative  policy.  That sort of approach would giveyou the opportunity  to remind people  that the Federal  Reserve is very much pro-growth  andpro-employment  and if they want  a higher growth rate  the way it will be achieved is not bydebauching the  currency but by increasing the saving rate  and  therefore improving  the economy'sability to increase investment.Especially  since we would be moving preemptively  again,  which I believe  very muchwe should, we have to be very  careful in the Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony.  I would hope thatwhatever the rest of us  are saying  between now  and the next meeting  that we not fall into theanti-growth trap.  One particular  tool that I think is very useful for us  analytically but one thatfeeds the we-are-against-growth  image, of which  we are  highly suspected  in any case, is  the useof the NAIRU.  We at the New  York Fed,  you may remember,  were extraordinarily  accurate  in1994  in forecasting the real economy  and extraordinarily  inaccurate  in predicting  inflation,which we overestimated.  The need for humility being  a great teacher,  this pushed us very hardin the direction of trying to figure out why we made that mistake.  One of the things that we havebecome  rather convinced of is that the NAIRU  is a very interesting  analytical tool, but it is  a verypoor  forecasting tool.  The more we talk  about it as if it were  going to tell us what we should donext month,  however eloquently we express  ourselves,  the more I think we come  across  as antigrowth.  I see that as unwise because  it leads the American people to believe that what we thinkwe  are doing to help them is in fact harmful to them.  This does  not help the public policy debatenor does it help the posture of the Federal  Reserve.I am  sorry for being a bit long-winded, but I do think  that "B" asymmetric,  seriouslyasymmetric,  is the right choice  and that we ought to be  girding our loins  for a probable tighteningat the next meeting.2/4-5/97

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I understand your argument.  I have to confess,though, that I have  some concerns  about waiting.  The  market is now aware  that we experiencedvery strong economic  growth last year and that we are seeing some of the effects of that growthin terms of capacity use and so forth.  As we go  down the road,  I do not think that the  public willbe  able to distinguish  between  a growth rate  that is  slowing from 2 percent to nothing versusslowing from 3 percent plus down to 2 percent or a bit less.  So,  if we do not move  now, I thinkpeople will be even more convinced  that we will not take  action  under circumstances  of slowinggrowth.  We may therefore find ourselves more paralyzed  at the next meeting,  and that couldcause us some  problems that will  be very  difficult to deal with.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I would just comment that the last thing I want  to do isto look at the last quarter's  growth.

MR.  HOENIG.  I understand.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  In other words, to cater to that point of view  would beunwise.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  But I think that perception  exists.  In any event, we now see at least areasonable  consensus  that higher inflation is in prospect, and that is what we should act on.  If wedo not move when  we have that  sort of consensus,  I think we  will find ourselves  in a moredifficult position in terms of taking action down the  road.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, the recent  surge in economic  activity has raised thelevel of output, which  already appeared  to be above  its long-run  potential.  This has intensifiedmy concerns  about the outlook for rising inflationary  pressures, and I think it has provided  astronger case  for tightening policy.  Moreover,  the two monetary policy rules we consult at ourBank--one  is an estimated version  of Taylor's rule and the  second is  the nominal income growthrate rule--both  suggest the need  for an increase  in the funds  rate this quarter.  Even if we accept  a3 percent target  for core CPI, which  I think is too high, these rules  suggest that the funds rateshould be raised by 25 basis points or a bit more this quarter.  Of course,  an inflation  target of 2percent,  which  I think is more appropriate,  would involve stronger  action.  In my view, it is  timeto take  an  initial modest step  in tightening  policy, and therefore  I would prefer a 25  basis pointincrease  in the funds rate  to 5-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  The staff projects a decline  in the unemployment  rate  to 5  percent,more than 1/2  percentage  point below their estimate  of NAIRU,  and  as a result they seeprogressive  deterioration in the inflation outlook.  Now,  if we were  all sure of this forecast, Ithink we would all  agree  to tighten  immediately even though the sharpest  increases  in inflationdo not surface until  1998.I do want  to respond to Bob Parry's question,  does  that  "we" include  opportunists  oronly those who prefer a more deliberate  approach to reducing inflation?  I use the "we" as anencompassing  one in that  case.  Why not move now?  Uncertainty  about the forecast, about thestructure of the economy  or specifically  about the value  of NAIRU, justifies,  I think,  a morecautious  approach.  Fortunately, the usual  inertia in the inflation process and the prospect of a2/4-5/97reducing the need for immediate  action.  But the risk of above-trend  growth  and the risk that thecurrent  unemployment  rate is already below  NAIRU together strongly  support  an asymmetricpolicy  directive to complement  an unchanged  policy.There has been some very interesting discussion  by Don Kohn  and the Chairman  ofthe question,  if not now, when.  I think that is what we really  are talking  about here.  Oneperspective  has been that, indeed,  the time has come and  the only issue is to prepare the markets.There is a widespread  expectation that there will  be no policy change  at this meeting,  and atightening  move would be a great  surprise.  So that is the only issue.  I think we have  to thinkabout whether we  are at  that point  or whether there is  something we need  to trigger an  action.Let me give  you a perspective  that relates back to the staff forecast.  How would  werespond if  the staff forecast  turned out to be correct?  I would  argue that if we do see  a decline  inthe unemployment  rate,  specifically to the 5  percent rate in the staff forecast, that would be areason to tighten independently  of whatever  was happening  to inflation  pressures  directly.  Thatis, a further decline  in the  unemployment  rate would be  an appropriate  trigger  for an increase  inthe funds rate.  This  is just a general  view that as utilization rates  increase short-term rates  shouldincrease.  We  should build in that procyclicality  of interest  rates that would occur normally, forexample,  under a money growth rule with  a stable money  demand function  or under a Taylorrule.  If in the meantime  inflation pressures were  to build, then still more  aggressive  action  wouldbe required.  But that would be an example of a very  clear trigger.  Thank you.

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, this morning's  decision is a really tough one  andfrankly the comments  of Bob Parry and  Tom Hoenig  have made it tougher.  A number  of thecomments  you made have  given me  some  comfort, though,  so I can accept your recommendation2/4-5/97this morning.  But let me say emphatically  that unless we  see  a very marked change in theoutlook and the balance of risks  very soon, which  frankly  I do not expect, I think we  are going toneed to move to a  tighter policy posture.  I believe  we will almost certainly  have  to do so at thethan that.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Timing is everything,  I guess.  In  the past year or so I thought asomewhat tighter monetary policy would be appropriate.  I would  have reversed the insurancepolicy, the final one we took out at the beginning  of last year.  But as  the year progressed,  andlooking  at third-quarter  data, I began to believe that tightening could be postponed as theseeming slowness  of the expansion  gave us  some breathing room.  Now I feel  I was misledsomewhat by the unevenness  of economic progress  last year.  As I look back over the year,  I seean economy that clearly  was expanding  at a pace beyond  the long-term trend  and operating withconstrained labor resources in a financing  environment  that obviously was conducive to excess.Don and you, Mr. Chairman,  have presented us with  a couple of options,  particularlyDon's wait-and-see  option and another that I would characterize  as  see-and-do.  I am worriedabout the inflation dragon that is nibbling away.  In my view, the wait-and-see  attitude hasbecome a little more  dangerous  than it was in the past.  That is because  of what we already see.We see  an economy with a lot of life, driven by consumer spending and business  investment.We do not see the sluggish residential  investment picture  that we  thought we would.  We  seelabor markets that are tight by any measure.  I see financial markets that are too one-sided  andfrothy.  I do not know how  to measure inflation  anymore  after the discussion today, but anynumber I see  anyplace seems  to be expected  to turn up.  We see the signs of imminent  excesses.2/4-5/97I do not see restraining factors  that are going to pull them in, and like President Hoenig  I am  a bitworried  about the variability of the numbers  we keep getting.  These are  forcing us into orsuggesting  that inactivity  is the right course and  are prolonging the wait-and-see  attitude  andincreasing the  risk of the  inflation dragon.  I think we have  a clearer picture of the economy'sstrength right now, and I believe now is the  time to move.  I know there is the issue  of sayingsomething to prepare  the markets.  I don't think they are as unprepared  as  they were  in  1994.  Ibelieve there is  some sense out there of a possible  move;  the forecasts  suggest that people  expectus to move;  it is just a question  of when.  I think we should be proactive  and we  should bemoderate  in that proactivity.  So, I would align myself with President Parry's  suggestion  of a 25basis point increase  in the funds rate.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I completely  support your proposal; Ibelieve it is the right one.  I also think that suggestions that we may need  to move in the nearfuture  are probably  correct,  and I would  support that as the most likely probability.  But I am alittle uncomfortable  with what may be  an excessive  amount of prejudging that policy  action.  Iam a bit haunted by the fact that we all saw emerging pressures  that were clearly going  to lead toan outbreak of inflation a year or  18  months ago,  and here we  are.  I do not think we shouldforget that.  The outbreak is  still ahead of us.  The  pressures  are  still there.  They  may be  moreintense, and a rise in inflation may start tomorrow morning;  it may already  have started and wecannot  see it yet.  But I think we  should be a little cautious about prejudging  what we  are goingto have to do at any point in the future.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.2/4-5/97

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I am delighted with last year's results  even though theywere not forecast by anybody.  [Laughter]  I hope for similar mistakes  this year in the sense  ofmore  growth, lower unemployment, and  less inflation than we are now projecting.  But I alsorecognize  that if we had been more accurate  in  anticipating the way  1996  was going to come outa year ago, then in spite of that more  favorable  inflation outlook we would not have notcheddown  the funds rate early  last year.  And I would not have supported  reducing the  funds rate ifwe had been  able  to anticipate more  accurately the way the  year came out.  Given that, logic tellsme  that we would have  been better off with hindsight not to have recalibrated,  and  we probablywould be happier today  if the funds rate were  at 5-1/2 percent.  Certainly, if it were at 5-1/2percent, we would not be reducing  it.I am very concerned,  Mr. Chairman,  about how you are going to be  able tocommunicate  this to the markets, to  people in political circles,  and to the public at large.  TheLabor Department  tells us that there  are still  6 million people  who are  not working.  Fortunately,they do not live in my District, but I would like to see a lot more of those people find jobs.  Mostof the metropolitan areas  in my District have unemployment  rates of around 4 percent or lower,and this has been  the case  for a couple of years.  I would be  delighted if we  saw moremetropolitan  areas out in Bob Parry's District with 4 percent  unemployment.  So, I wouldendorse  fully what Bill McDonough has said--care  needs to be taken  to avoid  communicatingthat  we are concerned that there are too many people working, that unemployment  of 6 million istoo few, or that we would not be happy if there  were only 4 million unemployed.  I think that thisis  a very, very important communications  issue  as you try to prepare  the markets and everybodyelse for what seems to be unavoidable.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I buy into your basic approach.  I think the odds  are that we will haveto tighten.  It is not an  absolutely foregone  conclusion.  Some open-mindedness  is  appropriate,but I think your general  framework  is right.  On the communications  issue, all of us  around thetable have had a fair amount  of training  in economics  and we use  economists' shorthand.  Thatshorthand has meaning  among ourselves  and among our academic  peers.  But I must say thatsome  of the shorthand that gets used in public does not do us very much good.  We ought neverget ourselves in the position of saying that we are  tightening because  there is too much growth  orthe unemployment  rate  is too low.  Whenever we tighten, it ought to be explained  in aframework  of pro-sustainable growth  and pro-job  growth.  This NAIRU concept,  while it meansa lot to economists,  is  a very unfortunate way of communicating  because  99.99 percent of thepeople just do not understand it and it comes across  as  meaning that  we are against  growth andagainst more jobs.  While we as economists  understand the NAIRU concept and its usefulness,we really have  to recast  our whole approach  in terms of communicating  that we are pro-growth,and  it can be  done.  Our case  is much more  salable  if we put price  stability in that context.  Iwould urge  you in your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony, and I would urge  all of us in theaftermath  of that, to move strongly in that direction in our public comments because  I think it isthe most effective  way that we can educate the public  and further their understanding  of thevalue of price stability.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  if we believe the Greenbook  forecast, we will seecore inflation  accelerate from 2.6 percent last year to 2.8  percent this year and to 3.2 percent nextyear.  If we add in the adjustment for technical  changes, the number in  1998  accelerates to 3.6percent,  which I believe we would all find unacceptable.  It really comes down to  the question,  as2/4-5/97a number of people have  said, of whether  we have  confidence in this  forecast.  If we believe theforecast, we  should be tightening now, given  the lags in monetary  policy.  However, labor costsand  prices have not accelerated  as  we would  have expected on the basis of past experience.  So,I think it is understandable  that  we have some  questions about the inflation forecast  in theGreenbook.  Given the uncertainty,  I personally  believe  that the prudent  thing to do is to waitlonger at this point to see if some early signs  emerge that inflation is closer to accelerating.  Atthat time I believe we  should be prepared  to  act immediately.  I am concerned  about the inflationdragon, as  you artfully described  it, nibbling  away  at us.  It involves an  insidious buildup ofinflation  at .1 percent or  .2  percent a year.  Of course, we have  not seen that buildup yet in any ofthe core price  measures, but it is something  that I  am very concerned  about because  once higherinflation  gets built into the structure  it may be  very difficult to  get it out of the  structure.  At thispoint, I clearly support "B"  asymmetric.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I also  support your recommendation  for  "B" asymmetric.  I wouldinclude  a strong expression  in your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  of our concern  about thesustainability  of low inflation with tight labor markets.  I believe this is the best informed  groupabout the American  economy  that one could possibly assemble anywhere,  with the benefit of thebest statistical analysis  and a real feel  for the  economy  from around the country.  And yet wecome back in the end to our gut feeling about  what is happening.  That  feeling has  changed  sincethe last meeting.  You pointed  out that evidence  of higher inflation  is not very  solidly based onthe statistics, and the question  is whether  we are sure  that we have to worry  about thesustainability of this growth and  its consistency with price  stability.  I cannot be sure, but I think2/4-5/97everybody  around the table would agree  that the prudent  thing to do if we had to do somethingtoday would  be to  move, and yet there  are reasons for waiting a little longer.With  respect to your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony,  I think a lot of very importantthings have been  said around  this table about how to couch  it and how to communicate  theimportance  of sustainable  growth.  I am not worried about  our wasting credibility asset.  I thinkour credibility  and your personal  credibility  are  so high right now that if you write  strongHumphrey-Hawkins  testimony,  you may get a correction  in both the equity markets  and the bondanything.  [Laughter]  We may be able to accomplish  our objective  without moving  the fundsrate.  After  all,  what is important is controlling  the economy.  But that is  a problem we will haveto deal  with when we meet again in March.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stem.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I agree with your recommendation.  Let me just take a moment  toelaborate.  In my view,  circumstances  have not changed significantly  in recent months,  so Icontinue to think there is a reasonably  high probability that we are going to want to adopt a morerestrictive policy over the course of 1997.  But if I ask myself why now, I think we do not have areason that we can use that will  garner  any amount of support for acting at this juncture.  I thenask  myself the further  question:  What are  the consequences  if your soon-to-become-famousinflation dragon does start to nibble a little  sooner than we expect  and  we find ourselves  behindthe curve?  It seems to me the implications  of that are that either we would  have to move a littlefurther at the  end of the  day than  we otherwise would or maybe  we would move by the  sameamount but in a more  concentrated  period of time  than otherwise.  Those  costs do not seem to meto be very  great.  So, I am comfortable  with your recommendation.2/4-5/97

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I favor alternative  C or at least something in thatdirection, and  my reasons remain the  same as  I have been stating:  I think inflation  is too high,and I see increasing  evidence that inflationary  pressures are building, especially  in labor markets.Finally, I do not think one can say that the stance of policy is at all restrictive right now;  so Ibelieve  some action  is called  for.  We clearly are  not going to do anything  at this meeting, but aswe anticipate  a possible move  in the future,  we  might want to think about  one that once  takenwould leave people in a position where they are uncertain about what the direction of the nextmove would be.  In other  words,  we are  in a much  different position than we were last time whenwe were in these  circumstances,  starting at a 3  percent funds rate with a long way to go.  Weprobably  are not too far away from where  we ought to be,  and we  should think about doingenough in one  shot so that there  is uncertainty  about  the direction of the next move.  That mightargue  against a modest  move as  an opening  salvo, one that  simply would encourage  people  tospeculate  on the next move.  Once  we got enough  tightening  done the last time,  we had a verybeneficial  impact on long-term markets.  In fact,  we raised the  funds rate by, as  I recall, 50 basispoints at one point and actually  got a drop in long rates.  It would  be nice to be able to get theresooner rather than later when and if we do move.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  I support  "B"  asymmetric.  It seems to me that thesituation is fairly  similar to where we were last  summer.  My  guess is that we will need to tightenthis year.  I have  the impression that employers have run  out of room  in terms of their ability topass on price increases.  So, I think the inflation  dragon is getting closer.  But I do believe thatwe have time to assess whether the  fourth-quarter  strength will necessarily  result in strained2/4-5/97resource  utilization.  We should  take advantage  of the Humphrey-Hawkins  report to prepare  the

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, am  comfortable  with the way youlaid things out and I  support your recommendation.  It  became clear to me as the go-aroundproceeded yesterday  that I am  at least  a bit more optimistic  than some around the table in termsof how the wage  pressures may play  out.  My view may be colored by the nature of the economyin our region, which has topped off, and my expectation  that a  similar development may begin toshow through elsewhere in  the nation  as housing and other  sectors of the nation's  economy beginto slow.  I also want to associate  myself with those who say that there is a good bit to be  gainedby preparing  our constituencies  for  a policy move in the period  ahead.  I am not thinking just ofthe financial  markets  and Congress but the  broader  constituency.  I think it can  be very helpful toour long-term  credibility to prepare  the public,  given where I believe people think we stand  at themoment.  So,  I support the recommendation  for no change and an  asymmetrical  directive.

MR. BERNARD.  The draft  wording is at the bottom of page 21  in the Bluebook:  "Inthe implementation  of policy for the immediate  future,  the Committee  seeks to maintain theexisting degree of pressure on reserve positions.  In the context  of the Committee's  long-runobjectives for price  stability and sustainable  economic  growth,  and giving  careful considerationto economic,  financial,  and monetary developments,  somewhat  greater reserve restraint  would orslightly lesser reserve restraint  might be  acceptable  in the  intermeeting  period.  The contemplatedreserve  conditions  are expected  to be  consistent with some moderation  in the expansion  of M2and M3 over coming months."
