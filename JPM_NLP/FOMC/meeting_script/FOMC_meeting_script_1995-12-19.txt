[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you very much.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Jack  is  a veteran  of  the  Fed who needsno  introduction.To  start  off,  would somebody  like  to  move  the  minutes  for the

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  We need acceptanceof  the Report of  Examination of  the  System  Open Market  Account.  Ithas been distributed.  Any  questions?  If  not, would  somebody like  tomove  it?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  I now call  on  PeterFisher.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would  like  to  beginwith  the Mexican  swap  renewal  before  turning  to  the  market  reports.All  of  this  is  summarized on  the  one-page outline  of  my report  thatyou have before you.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions?  Yes,  Larry.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Peter, would you  refresh my memory  as  to  why weincreased  the Mexican  swap  line  from $1-1/2  to  $3 billion  last

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  That  was part  of  the package.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Remember,  there was  a first  phase whereby  theCommittee  initially activated the  existing  $3 billion.  Then, at  theend of  December  1994,  there was an  effort  to  deal  with this problem inwhat  I sometimes  call  the  "old fashioned" way by getting bankstogether and so  on.  The Committee approved a  "temporary" swap  line  of$1.5  billion  in  conjunction with the  arrangement that  included $5billion provided by  the BIS.  Then,  the Committee  went up  to  the  $3billion  temporary  line  in  the  context  of  the  President's  secondprogram.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  But  we are now getting out  of  the  secondprogram?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  So,  why are  we not  taking our  level  ofcommitment back down  to  $1-1/2  billion?12/19/95

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  original  $3 billion was  associated with theregular  program.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There  are  two  $3 billion  swap  arrangements;think of  it  that  way.  There  is  the  basic  $3 billion, which was whatwe  already had  in  place.  Then  we added  a supplemental  one  lastare  letting that  whole  supplemental  arrangement  expire,  and we aregoing back to  the  original,  regular  $3 billion.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  other part  of  the  confusion  is  that  theTreasury also has  a  $3 billion  swap  line  with the Mexicans.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There  are  lots  of  threes.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Too many threes  around  here.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further  questions  for  Peter?  Cathy.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Just  a couple of  factual  questions:  The  $650million  is  from  the  regular  swap  line  or  from  the  temporary one  thatwas  part  of  the  program to  help Mexico  last year?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  It's  drawn under the  regular  swap  line.  Theynever drew enough  to  get  into  the  supplemental  or  temporary $3billion.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Is  it  a function  of  our  regular  swap programthat we  are  repaid by  the  Department  of  the  Treasury?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  One  of  the  conditions  for  the  Committee'sapproval  of  the Mexican  drawings  was  that we  would be  repaid eitherway--that is,  by  the Mexicans  or by the U.S.  Treasury.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  The Treasury would repay us,  if  necessary,under  either program on  any part  of  the  $6 billion?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think  it  was  just  an accounting  conveniencethat we  assigned these  drawings  to  their  regular  swap  line.  We  couldhave  done  it  the  other way around;  it  might have  been somewhat morelogical.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I just  wanted to  understand that.  Secondly,the  North American Framework Agreement  (NAFA) was  to provide  a forum,according to  footnote  2  in your memo,  for more  regular  consultationson economic and financial  developments.  Has  that  worked?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  My view is  that  it  has  worked, though maybe notas  well  as  it  should have.  In  particular,  there have been  stepped upconsultations  at  all  levels  among  all  three countries,  some bilateraland some  trilateral.  I think  in  fact  one of  the most  useful  thingsthat  was done--the only  thing  I think we did right--was  that  Peterarranged  to  have a weekly conference call  with  the  Canadians  and theMexicans, which  allows us  to  do  a once-a-week update of  economic andfinancial  conditions  in  the  three  countries.  That  regular weekly callhas meant  that  it  is  therefore much easier  to  have  ad hoc  contacts.So,  that  is  one  element  that  has come  out  of  this process.12/19/95

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Combining  that with  the  additional  transparencythat  the  IMF  obtained  from  the Mexicans  in  terms  of  some  of  their  datareporting,  do  we  feel  that  we would  not have been  in  the  situationthat we  seemed to  be  in  earlier  in  terms  of  our  knowledge  of  how muchtheir reserves  were being  depleted?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  The  capacity of  central  banks  to manipulatetheir  reserves  is  quite  substantial,  but  even in  1994  I think we  had apretty good  fix  on  their  reserves,  though we  may not have  kept  theCommittee  as  well  informed  as  we  should have.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It  is  1994  that  I was  getting at.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think you need to  separate the  question ofwhether  the market had a good sense  of  a number  of  data points  fromtheir balance sheet  and macroeconomics  and whether we  had goodinformation about  their reserves.  There were  only a very few  days  inabout  what  their reserve  levels  were.  But  I don't  think,  if you  take1994  as  a whole,  that we  had  a sense  that we weren't  getting  a goodlevel  of  cooperation and understanding  of  what  their  reserve balanceswere.  That's  internally.  That's  different  from  the public  issue  thatI think  the  IMF was  addressing.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  The  one  thing  that has  happened since wecirculated  Steve Kamin's memo  is  that  they  have  adopted  a newframework  for  their  monetary policy.  This  is  not  a big deal,  but  theyhave  adopted more  conventional  definitions  of  their domestic  assetsand international  reserves  than they used in  the past.  I think thiswill  facilitate market analysis  of  their operations.  I don't  think  itavoids  the possibility  that  the  market may  still  misinterpretdevelopments  in  Mexico,  but  I think  the  warning  flag  is  quitesubstantial.  It  remains  true  that  the  capacity for  the  Mexicans,  orany government,  to  try to  slip  things  through is  still  there.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I wasn't  so  concerned about  whether the  marketknew.  I was  more concerned about  whether we  know in  a timely way.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Partly because of  these calls  that  Peter hasarranged and other  contacts, we are much more  informed than we were.We  can't avoid all  surprises.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  A  final  question:  There  is  an  implication  inyour  memo  that while we will  approve  this  renewal,  we won'tnecessarily be  receptive to  letting  them use  this  swap  arrangement  fora number  of  different  reasons.  Is  that  a wrong  implication  to  drawfrom  this memo?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think that's  the  right  implication andinference, if  I may put  it  that way.  I can't  speak for  the Committee.We did have  a visitor last  Friday from  the  research directorate of  theBank of  Mexico.  I went  over both the  fact  that  we would not  renew the$650  million drawing  and that  that  was a matter  for him to  take  upwith the United  States Treasury.  I also told him  that  the Committeewas  going to  consider  this  matter  today but that,  all  thingsconsidered, there  was  not  a lot  of  FOMC appetite  for new Mexicandrawings  in  1996.  He  said that  was  certainly the basis  on which theywere  operating.  His  view is  that  of  only one  reasonably  important12/19/95Mexican  official  on  the  subject, but  I think he  was  very  forthcomingon  that.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  So  they don't  expect  to  use the  swap  facilityeither.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  That's  one  of  the  reasons  why I think  theirpreferred position would be  for  the  Treasury to  roll  over  the  twodrawings.  They have  a  $650  million short-term swap  outstanding withthe  Treasury too,  and  I think  the Mexican position would be  that  theywould  like  to  roll  the  two  together  into  a medium-term  obligation  toprovide  themselves  a bit  of  a cushion,  given that  the door  is  going  tobe  closed later  in 1996.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Certainly  that's  their position;  I think  that'sa  logical  position as  well.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  The  sole  roadblock  is  this  certification  issue?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I don't  know whether  that's  the  sole roadblock,but  that's  an  issue  that  we wanted  to  surface.  The  staff  felt  that  itwas  a little  arcane,  and  I apologize  that  the  memo may not have beenclear.  The  truth  of  the matter  is  that  even  absent  that  issue,  giveneverything else going  on,  the  objective of  the program was basicallyto  get Mexico's  financial  situation stabilized, and that  has beenachieved.  Now, whether  they will  be  able  to  move  from  that  to whatthey need to  do  in  terms  of  growth  is  a  different matter.  We can't  dothat  for  them.  I think  the  general  attitude  is  that  we have  done  whatwe  can.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I have a general  question about whether weare going  to  look  at  these  swap  arrangements  in  any broad andorganized fashion.  I know you  have mentioned before and  others havesaid here  that,  in  the  foreign exchange  markets  in  which we operatetoday, these  arrangements are  of  questionable usefulness and  ought  tobe  reexamined.  I don't  think we can single  out  this  one  with Mexico.I think we need  to  look at  all  of  them  together.  My question is:  Arethere any plans  to  do  that?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The answer  is  "yes."

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Okay.  Will  that  involve  discussions withcounterparties  in  general  about  foreign  exchange  intervention  and  thesupport  facilities?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we should  first  discuss  itamongst  ourselves here  before we decide  to  involve  anyone  else.  Theideal  solution  to  this  obviously anachronistic  setup  is  notnecessarily to  abandon  all  such arrangements because  they  are beingemployed as  a means  of  linking us  with  other central banks,  but  toreplace  them with something  that  reflects  more  relevant considerationsin  the market.  We  would not  expand  the  swap  arrangements, but wewould  do something different  to maintain  our  relationships12/19/95internationally and bring  this process  up  to  the  latter part  of  the20th  century rather  than  the middle  part.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  The  other  issue  that  I think  is  difficult  isthat  swap  lines  to  developing  countries  can be  troublesome.  I knowthat we  have North American trade  considerations.  However,  as  welearned  in  this  case,  what  was  intended for  one purpose  in  effectdrags  us  directly  or indirectly  into  what  I would characterize asintermediate-  to  long-term financing  to  support  debt  restructuring.  Idon't  think  that's  our role.  As  I have mentioned before, I think  itpotentially raises  questions  about  the  independence  of  a central  bank.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am not  as worried  as  you are  about  theindependence  question, but  I certainly agree  that  what  we have  servesno  economic or  financial purpose  of  which  I am aware.  PresidentBroaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Under  the current  arrangement,  we  have  anagreement with the  Treasury that  they will  take  us  out  if  the Mexicansdon't pay back the  current drawing.  I may be  mistaken, and this  isjust  a point of  clarification, but  I seem to  have  read or  heardsomewhere  that  if  we  renew the  swap  line  and  if  there  is  a drawingdespite  our  current  intentions,  the  Treasury could not make  acomparable commitment  to  take  us  out  in  the  future  on  such  a drawingbecause of  some piece  of  legislation.  Is  that  right?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  As was  outlined in  the  memo,  the Treasury issubject  to  the  certification process  of  the Mexican  Debt  DisclosureAct.  In  addition,  the  Treasury appropriation  for  fiscal  year  1996contains  a provision  that  limits  the extent  to  which they  can use  theESF  for  operations without  Congressional  approval.  Since  they maytake  over our portion  of  the Mexican drawings,  that  could mean  theywould be  using the  ESF  for more  than  $1 billion  and  for longer  than  60days.  So,  they would be  constrained in  terms  of  taking us  out  offurther Mexican  swap drawings.  Coming back  to  President Minehan'squestion,  that  is  one  of  the reasons  why it's  unlikely  that  theTreasury will want  to  get  into  this  right  away once disbursementsunder the  President's  program  come  to  an end.  Since  they could not beour partner,  we would be  less  likely  to want  to  do  something on  ourown than  we might  have been in  the  past.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I think  it's  important  to  keep  in mind  that wehave not  thought  of  Treasury takeouts  as  the  presumption under whichwe have  swap  lines.  It  was a presumption under which the  Committeeundertook this  drawing  in  the set  of  circumstances  that  existed intakeouts has  not  been a presumption  for the  existence  of  swap  lines.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I am  focusing specifically on whether  therecould be  a Treasury takeout  if  the  current  arrangement were continuedand a further  drawing were  made.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  There would have  to  be  an assured means  ofrepayment  for any drawing under  the  general  arrangements.  Actually,the Mexican Debt  Disclosure Act has  a provision requiring an assuredmeans of  repayment  in  our  case.  So,  we  would have  to  have  some  senseof  how the  System was  going to  get  repaid  in  any case.  In  theparticular circumstances  that Mexico  was  in,  we were  getting  involved12/19/95at  least  indirectly  in  a medium-term program and  the  Committee  feltthat  stretching  the maturity to  12  months  was  about  as  far--maybefurther  for  some  members--as  it  could be  stretched  in  terms  of  ournormal  financial  operations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further  questions  for eithergentleman?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Peter, you mentioned  that  the bond market wasselling  off  further  this morning.  What  is  it  doing now?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  The  long bond  is  at  6.22  percent,  I think,  so  itis  backing up  a bit.  The middle  of  the  maturity range  is  also  backingup.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  There was  more  news  on  the  budget  and,  as  Iunderstand  it,  more pessimism about  the prospects  for  an agreement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  How many 32nds  was  that  down?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It  was  down  about  1/2  point.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  1/2  point.  In yield,  the  long bond tradedup  to  6.22  percent  early overnight  in Tokyo,  came down to  6.18percent, and was back up  to  the  6.22  - 6.24  percent  range  in  the  lasthour.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  (Consulting a pocket  electronic marketmonitor)  The truth is  the markets  are  down 10/32.  The  cash marketfor  the  long bond  is  at  6.22  percent.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let's move on  to  thestaff  reports.  Mr.  Prell.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions?  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  This  isn't  a question, just  acomment  on the  economic  situation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  there  are no  questions--yes,President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mike,  this  is  a question  on  the  Greenbook.  Onemployment  jobs  per month over  the  next  two  years,  the  1996-1997period.  This  is  keeping  in  mind that we are  dealing with a forecastof  close  to potential  output during  this period.  I was  wonderingabout  this  100,000  job  figure.  It  seems  low compared to  figures  thatwe  have  looked at.  I was  wondering whether you would expect  that  ifwe  get  to  higher  levels  of  payroll  employment gains--125,000  or150,000  new jobs  per month--this would  strain  the  economy's capacityduring  the  forecast period.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  One  feature  of  the  latest  forecast  is  a change  inour projection  of  labor  force  growth.  As we  have  reported  from  timeto  time  over  the past  few years,  we  have been  surprised by the  lack  ofrise  in the  labor  force participation  rate.  The  most recentobservation was  distinctly short  of  our  expectations.  So,  we  haveflattened  that path out  considerably and have  less  labor  force  growthgoing forward.  Now, what would happen  if  demand were  stronger  andemployment were  to  grow faster?  One possibility is  that  labor  forceparticipation  remains  on the  track we  are forecasting  and we  do get  athat  creates  some  additional pressures.  Alternatively, maybe at  longlast what we  would see  is  a response  by potential workers  to  thehealthy demand  for them,  and you would  see some  renewed growth  inlabor  force participation and stability  in  the  unemployment rate.  Idon't  think we can  say what  will happen with any certainty at  thispoint, but  we have made a distinct  change  in the  trajectory of  thelabor  force  in  this  forecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for Mike?  If  not,Vice Chairman,  do you want  to  start  off?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Yes.  The Second  District  continuesto  show slow growth essentially across  the board.  Retail  sales  forthe holiday period have been quite weak  in New York,  although the more12/19/95upscale  stores  like  Saks  Fifth  Avenue  have been doing reasonably well,perhaps  to  some  degree  because  of  the  considerably higher  bonuses  fromthe  financial  services  industry.Our  forecast  for  the  national  economy  is  somewhat  lower  thanthat  of  the  Greenbook, but  the  general  shape  is  similar.  Underpresent monetary policy we have  growth  slowing  to  2.2  percent  in  1996and 2.0  percent  in  1997  as  compared with 2-1/2  percent  for both yearsin  the  Greenbook.  Not  surprisingly,  inflation  is  a bit  lower  in  ourforecast,  2.9  percent  in  1996  and 2.8  percent  in  1997,  with  theunemployment  rate  rising  to  5.9  percent  and  6.2  percent  in  the  twoyears.  We have,  of  course,  tried to  produce  a forecast  that  has  therisks balanced.  However,  I am concerned about  a number  of  factorsthat  I believe  slant  the  risks  to  the  down side.  In an  atmosphere ofcontinuing rationalization  and restructurings  of  business,  jobsecurity,  especially for white-collar workers,  could  cause concernsthat  would make  consumer  spending  lower  than  that  in  either  forecast.Second, business  fixed investment  has  held up  extraordinarily well;both we and the  Greenbook have  it  slowing down.  But  it  is  still  theprimary driver of  growth and  could be  less  strong,  especially  ifconsumer spending  should be  somewhat weaker.  Third,  the growth  we  areassuming  in  Canada, Mexico, Japan,  and Europe  is  not  terribly  strong.But  if  we  are wrong,  I think  it  quite  likely  that  growth will  beweaker  in  those  countries  and not  stronger.  Because  inflation hasbeen  lower  and we  believe  it  will  continue  to  be  lower  than we  thoughtit  would be  when we  last  adjusted monetary policy in  July, we  have  hadan effective real  tightening  of  policy, and in  our  forecast  thisphenomenon will  continue.  For a central  bank with  a goal  of  pricestability, a  somewhat  firm  and firming policy may be  a good anddesirable thing,  especially if  you  think  as  I do  that  an  inflationrate of  about  3 percent nominal--say,  2 percent  real  if  we  take  outthe bias  in  the CPI--is  too high.  However,  I would prefer  that policynot  be  so  tight  as  to be  a  source of  additional weakness  to  the  realeconomy, which we  consider  to  be  the case  now.  We must be  flexible inour  policy.  This  year we  finished tightening  in  February  and easedslightly  in  July.  If  growth  should  turn out  to  be  stronger  than we oreven  the Greenbook  suggest,  clearly  the Committee  should  evaluate  thatstrength  and what  it  tells  us about  the  future;  and if  policy has  tobe  adjusted, it  should be  adjusted.  However,  we generally believethat  the  approach to  an even  lower  inflation  rate  should beopportunistic.  Our policy  should be  slanted toward  fighting  inflationif  it  should move up;  but rather  than  force  it  down at  the  excessiveexpense  of  real  growth, we  should be opportunistic  in  taking advantageof  lower  inflation when it  happens.There is  a  question whether  the present market  conditions  ineither the  stock or bond markets  should be  allowed to  inhibit policy.Clearly,  despite  the  slight  correction yesterday,  the  stock market  byany historical  standard is  overvalued.  If  one relates  it  to  dividendpayout  or price earnings  ratio  or market-to-book,  it  is  considerablyovervalued, but  it  has  been considerably overvalued  for  about threeyears.  What  one  isn't  sure  of  is  whether  this  is  a phenomenon  thatcould continue  or whether a correction will  take  place.  In  any event,I don't  think that  the  stock market  should drive policy.  It  seems  tome  that  the present  level  of  the  bond market,  given what we have  beenable  to  do  and what  the market  and the  economy have  been able  to  do  inreducing  inflation,  is  not unrealistic  at  all.12/19/95-9-Lastly,  as  regards  the budget  debate,  it  seems  to  me the  bestthing we  can do  is  to  distance  ourselves  from  the  debate.  I don'tbelieve we  should be punishing  politicians  for what  we  don't  like  orrewarding them  for what we  do  like,  but  rather that  monetary policyshould  follow  an independent  path.  In  my view,  to  the  degree  that wehave  opportunities to  show  that  that path  is  independent,  we  shouldtake  advantage  of  them.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I wanted to  focus  onone  of  the points  that Mike  Prell made,  and that  is  how we couldinterpret  the  likely consumption response  to  the  rise  in  asset values.He was  kind enough to  share  the  regressions with me.  The generalstory  is  that  the  marginal propensity  to  consume  from  an  incrementalstock market gain  is  about  5 percent.  The macroeconomic  regressionsvery much support  that.  What  I would  like  to  do  today  is  to  test  thatat  the micro level.  I asked  the National  Bureau of  Economic Researchto  run  the 1991  individual  tax model  file,  which  is  the  latest onethey have up,  to  look  at  a detailed distribution  of  dividends  receivedby taxpayers.  I would be  happy  to give  the detailed tables  to  anyonewho wants them.  I broke  this  down  into  five  classes.Look at  Table 1, which  has been  distributed to  you, and youcan  get  a feel  for  this.  The first  row  is  zero  dividends;  80  percentof  taxpayers,  which  I call  households and  the  terms  are  roughlysynonymous,  received no  dividends  at  all.  Another  13  percent  ofhouseholds received  less  than  $1,000  in  dividends,  and these  dividendsmade  up  about  4.4  percent of  the  total.  As  you  can see,  about  6percent  of  households got  about  30  percent  of  total  dividends.  At  thevery  top,  I broke down  those people  who received over  $10,000  ofdividends  into  those with less  than  $200,000  of  adjusted  gross  incomeand  those with more  than  $200,000  of  adjusted gross  income.  Group  5,the high-income, high-dividend  recipients make  up about  230,000households  and got  30  percent  of  total  dividends.  The next  thing  Iasked  the NBER  to  do was  to  calculate  after-tax adjusted gross  income.They have a  federal  tax  calculator, a state  tax calculator,  and asocial  security tax  calculator.  Column  3 in Table  1 shows  thedistribution  of  after-tax adjusted gross  income  for  each of  thosegroups.  The  last  column  is  designed to  get  at  disposable personalincome  in  the national  income  and product  accounts.  The mainingredients  that  are  not  in AGI  but  are  in disposable personal  incomeare  first,  transfer payments,  second,  fringe benefits,  and third,  theexcluded portions  of  dividends and  interest, which generally tend  toflow into  401(k) plans  and other constrained vehicles.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  includes  taxes?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  No.  Personal  taxes  and direct  taxes  are  out  ofboth columns  three  and four.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But  adjusted gross  income includestaxes.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That's  true,  but I computed  "after tax"adjusted gross  income.  I started with AGI  and and took out  federal,state, and employee FICA taxes.12/19/95-10-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  says  that  on your  table.  I beg yourpardon.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  As you  can see,  it  doesn't make  that muchdifference, but  I allocated that  portion of  disposable personal  incomethat  was not  in AGI  in  proportion to  wages  and  that  gives  me  the  lastcolumn.  Then  comes  the  thought  experiment.  Let's  assume  that  we  geta  $50  billion  increment  to  consumption, which  is  about  1 percent  ofpersonal  outlays.  That  would correspond to  a  5 percent marginalpropensity to  consume out  of  a  trillion dollar rise  in the  markets,which  is  about  the  order of  magnitude we  are  talking  about.  If youassume  that the  distribution of  dividends  is  a rough proxy for  thedistribution of  stock market  wealth,  then we  can  calculate for  eachgroup  how much  its  total  consumption would be  expected  to  change.  Ofcourse,  if  you don't  have any  stocks,  tough  luck.  If  you  are  in grouptwo,  which  includes people with  less  than  $1,000  in dividends,  then onaverage  we  would expect  your  household consumption  to  go up by  $154.amounts  to  about  0.25  percent  of  disposable personal  income  for peoplein  group two.  Now you get  to  the  interesting people, people  in  groupthree,  which  I suppose  does  not  include me  since  I am  in the  zerocategory and I can't  even borrow  at  Toys  'R Us!  [Laughter]  It  doesinclude my mother with her AT&T stock.  There  are  a lot  of householdsin  that  group.  They might  be  expected  to  increase  their  consumptionby  $2,000  per  household or  about  3 percent  of  income.  Now we  get  tothe  people  who have  dividends  and therefore  the  capital  gains.  Again,just  doing the  straight  apportionment,  for those  households makingless  than  $200,000  but having  at  least  $10,000  in  dividends,  we wouldexpect  an  average  increase  in  consumption  out  of  stock market  wealthof  $14,000.  It  is  conceivable  to  me  that  I could spend  an extra$14,000  a year, but  it  isn't  conceivable that  these households woulddo  so,  given their  relatively  low  level  of  disposable personal  income.Remember,  they are making  less  than $200,000,  and if  this  is  right,  wewould expect  them  to  increase  their  consumption by almost  one-fourthin  order  to  account  for that  extra  spending out  of  wealth.  Incategory  five,  where  everyone's  income  is  over  $200,000  and  theaverage  income  is  substantially higher  at  about  $800,000,  eachhousehold would have  to  spend  an extra  $65,000.  They could buy  twoCadillacs  they otherwise  would not have bought,  and that  would mean a7.7  percent  increase  in  their  consumption out  of  disposable  personalincome.The lesson  that  I draw from this  is  that,  given  the verynarrow distribution of  dividends,  it  would seem  that  the  increments  towealth are  relatively concentrated.  Even  combining those  twocategories,  I find a  12  percent  increase  in  spending out  of  stockdon't  see how the microeconomic  data  support  the macroeconomicestimate  of  $50  billion  in  extra consumption as  a result  of  the  risein  stock market  wealth.  There  are  other channels  that  could allow  itto happen.  I could,  for  example,  feel happier  and more  secure  in myjob because  the stock market  is  booming and go  out  and spend.  Theremust be  channels  through which  it  operates,  but  I am not  going  to  goon  any longer.  I have  other  tables  to  show how  liquidity-constrainedhouseholds  are.  They  suggest  that  it  would be very hard for  that  kindof  transmission mechanism  to  account  for  a lot,  particularly whensaving rates  are  already as  low as  they are.12/19/95-11-So,  Mike,  I have  to  disagree with you.  I don't  see  theupside potential.  I think we  are unlikely to  get  an extra  $50  billionin  consumption out  of  the  stock market  increase.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let  me note  just  another  channel  thatassociated at  a micro  level  with higher  capital  investment within  afirm.  That  increase  in  capital  investment  spills  through  intodisposable income  and could have an  impact  that way.  So,  it  is  quiteconceivable that,  despite your  very interesting appraisal,  there  is  achannel  that bypasses  this  and effectively impacts  disposable personalincome  through all  of  these  five  categories to  the  extent  that  that  isrelevant.  Obviously implicit  in any  evaluation of  stock market wealthgoing into  consumption, one  would have  to  trace  to  be  sure  that  thelevel  of  capital  investment  is  reflecting the  stock market wealthcreation.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I think  that  is  a very  fair  observation and Iwould be happy  to  use  that  to  supplement my  interpretation of  theregression.  The  regression had  labor  income,  capital  income,  transferincome,  and wealth  in  it.  So,  I would  expect that  that  would  appearin  that  transition.  The  extra  capital  spending might  feed throughinto higher disposable  income.  I think  that  would  show up  in  theincome numbers  and not  in  the wealth  numbers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  does.  I am just  saying  that  if  thatchannel  is  working vigorously, you  could reconcile both  these  data andthe  reduced  form  regression of  the  wealth effect  on  consumption.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  As  I read  it,  the  income  was  in  the  regression.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Just a point  of  fact:  Does  the  regression havelabor  income on  the right  or  total  income  on  the right?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't know what  this  particular  regression is.I assume we  are  talking about  the  MPS  model.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  The MPS  model  has  both labor  income  andproperty  income on  the  right-hand  side.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  They are  in  there as  well  as  the  stock market.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Let  me  say, we  are  looking  at net worth  in  themodel,  so  that  also  shows up,  which is  the  other  side  that you  citedin passing  at  the  end  of  your comments.  Could  I clarify one pointwithout  getting  into  an argument  about  the  construction of  thesenumbers?  There  is  no  significant wealth effect built  into  ourforecast.  If  you  look  at  the personal  saving  rate,  there  is  noneutralized this,  taking  into  account  also the  debt  side of  thepicture.  That's why  I characterized this  as  an upside risk.  Itdoesn't  take  the  full  dimension  of  the model wealth effect  in  order togive  rise  to  an upside  risk of  the sort  that  I was  suggesting.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  So,  the  consumption levels  in  the  forecast donot reflect  those  from  the MPS model?12/19/95-12-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

PRESIDENT BOEHNE.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The  basic  storyin  the  Philadelphia District  is  essentially the  same.  Mainly,  theregion  is  a  laggard  compared to  the nation.  The  outlook  is  for moreof  the  same.  Much of  the  laggard  effect  is  coming  from Pennsylvania;Delaware  and New Jersey compare more  favorably to  the nation.  Onbalance,  the  evidence  from recent  indicators is  that  the pace ofgrowth  in  the  District  is  slower  now than  it  was  several  months  ago.Retail  sales  in particular  reflect  a cautious attitude  on  the part  ofconsumers.  Retailers  are  still  hopeful  that  the  last  week beforeChristmas will  deliver  them  from an otherwise  dismal  season, but  thediscounting over this  past  weekend has  been very heavy.  Employmentgrowth  is  quite  slow  in the  region,  even  in  industries likemanufacturing and  construction where activity  is  expanding.  Attitudes--business  attitudes  in particular--are  still  generally positive  aboutthe  outlook, but  they  appear to  be  somewhat  more  fluid.  They couldresolidify on  the more positive  side  or  they could  flow more  to  thepessimistic side  depending on how policy and other developmentsunfold.  I have  the  sense  that we  are  at  one  of  those pivotal periodswhere people  are  less  certain  about  where  things  are  going andattitudes  can  flow either way.Turning  to  the  national  economy, most  recent economic  datasuggest  that  the  expansion  is  decelerating some  from earlier months.The  extent  of  the  deceleration  is  an open  question.  It  may be  thatthe  strength of  the  third quarter borrowed  from the  fourth quarter andthat  the  underlying strength of  the  economy remains  intact.  Or,  itcould mean that  the underlying strength  is  beginning  to  wane.  Onbalance, my  judgment  is  that  the  downside  risk  to  the  economy hasrisen some  since we  last  met.  The possibility of  more of  an  inventoryoverhang is  higher  now than  a month  or two  ago.  The  strength ofexports  is  more  open  to  question.  The economies  of  Canada,  the U.K.,and Germany may be weaker  than  the  forecasts suggest,  not  to  mentionMexico  or Japan.  While we  can debate  the  consumer outlook, my senseis  that  if  we  are  surprised, we will be  surprised because  consumptionwill be weaker  rather  than  stronger.  Also,  the  case  that  U.S.monetary policy may be  inadvertently  tighter  is  now more convincing  inmy judgment  than  it  was  several  months  ago,  although  that's  a subjectfor later  in  the meeting.The  outlook for  inflation  remains  about  as  it  has been,neither accelerating nor  decelerating much during  the next  year or  so.Given that  the economy  is  in a mature  expansion phase, I think we needto  remain alert  to  signs  of  accelerating inflation.  However,  pricepressures remain remarkably subdued.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, economic growth  in  the TwelfthDistrict  slowed this  fall.  California  lost  a considerable  number  ofgovernment  jobs  in October  and November, particularly at  the  localgovernment  level.  This  job  loss  apparently boosted the  stateunemployment  rate.  However, private-sector growth  appeared to havesubstantial momentum  in  the state.  Economic  activity in  the  State  ofWashington paused during  the Boeing  strike.  Retailers  there worried12/19/95-13-about  slow holiday  sales,  as  about  1 percent  of  the  state's workforcemissed paychecks  from  Boeing  during  the  strike.  However, under  thenew  contract  returning workers  are  getting  a big  Christmas present,  a10  percent  lump  sum payment  that will  make up  the  income  lost  earlier.Elsewhere,  labor markets  remain  tight  in  much  of  the  District.Employment growth  slowed but generally continued  to  outpace  thenation.  In  fact,  in  terms  of  employment growth  over  the  past year,the  District  now has  three  of  the  four  fastest  growing states  in  thenation.  Nevada and Utah are  number  one  and number  two,  and Oregon  hasmoved up  to  number  four.  I should also  note  that  the Arizona economycontinues  to  expand rapidly despite  the  adverse  effects  of  thesituation in Mexico.  So  far  this  year, exports  to  Mexico  from Arizonaand  California have  fallen  8 percent,  a bit  less  sharply  than  overallU.S. exports  to Mexico.  Apparently, Arizona and California  areproviding a lot  of  the components  and materials  to  Mexican maquiladoraplants whose production has been  increased.Turning  to  the national  economy, despite  sluggish growthduring  the  current  quarter,  our model  forecast  calls  for  real  growthat  a rate between 2-3/4  and  3 percent  over  1996,  which  is  somewhathigher  than  the  Greenbook.  Our  structural model predicts  thatinflation will  remain close  to  3 percent  over  the next  year or so  butwill  eventually go up  because  the economy  is  operating at  a highlevel.  The acceleration  in  inflation occurs  despite  the  fact  that  thepolicy rule  in  our model  acts  to  restrict  the  growth of  nominal  GDP byraising  the  funds  rate by a small  amount  late next  year and  followsthrough with  further  increases  throughout  the  forecast.  However,  Iexpect that  the  economy will  turn  out  somewhat weaker  than  the modelis  predicting.  Surveys  suggest  that  inflation  expectations  of  bothlong  and short  horizons  have  come  down  about  20  to  30  basis pointsover  the  last  quarter,  and perhaps  around  50  basis  points  since  thebeginning of  this year.  I believe  that  the  behavior of  financialhave  indeed come  down  this much,  the  implication  is  that  the realfunds  rate has  gone  up.  As  a consequence, policy may be  somewhat  morerestrictive than  in  our  forecast  since  the model  we use  is  based  onbackward-looking expectations.  Thus, both real  output growth andinflation  could come  in  somewhat  lower  than  in  our  forecast.  Thankyou.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  slow growth  continues  in NewEngland.  Nonfarm employment grew for  the  third  straight month,although  the  overall  gain was quite  small.  In  total,  the  region's  jobcount was  up  only  slightly less  than 1 percent  over the  previous  yearas  compared with nearly 3 times  that  rate of  growth  over  the  12  monthsprior  to  that.  The  region's  unemployment rate  declined to  a levelwell  below the national  rate, but  consumers  remained wary anduncertain.  Real  wage  growth has  been negative.  Consumer confidencedropped, especially in  the component  of  that  measure  that  looks  atexpectations.  Retailers  have  felt  this pressure.  As  one  of  ourBeigebook contacts put  it,  he  could not  explain  the  fits  and startsthat  have  characterized the retail  market  this  fall.  Business ishorrible one week and very strong  the  next.  On  a more  upbeat note,manufacturing contacts  report  solid recent  sales,  with demandincreasing for  machine  tools  and industrial  equipment, computer andelectronics products, health  care  supplies,  and a range  of  building12/19/95-14-products  and equipment.  Input  prices  have  stabilized somewhat,  andcontinued competitive pressures  have  precluded  increases  in  outputprices.  Manufacturing  jobs  continue  to  decline,  but  employees  aregetting hard to  find  for  some  job  vacancies  that  call  for  especiallyhigh  technical  skills.  The market  for  residential  real  estate  isneither  good nor  bad.  Expectations  of  next  spring's  seasonal  pickupare positive,  given  this year's  decline  in  interest  rates.  In  fact,if  rates  go  any lower we  could  see a mini  surge,  at  least  in  the  threenorthern  states  and in Massachusetts  where markets  are  stronger.  Somecommercial  building  is  under way,  though  the  improvement  is  spotty andconfined to  eastern Massachusetts.  Bank  lending  in  the  Districtremains  slower than  that of  the  nation as  a whole, with  negativegrowth  in commercial  and industrial  loans most  recently.  Consumerloan  growth  is  somewhat  erratic  but generally  in  line  with,  if  notstronger  than,  the national  pace.Finally, while  the  economic  climate  is  tepid, if  not  cool,  weare  going to  witness  a very hot  senatorial  race.  Bill  Weld  is  takingon John Kerry for  his  Senate  seat,  a  contest  that  has  been  labeled bysuch  far  flung media as  The  Economist  as  the battle  of  the  bluebloods.  This  may augur well  for  Massachusetts  at  least  until  theelection.  As  an  example,  since  a mill  burned  down  in  Lawrencerecently, insure  that  displaced workers  receive  as  much  aid as  possible.  Theirefforts  have paid  off according  towith workers  being  sure  they  can survive  until  the  new  facility iscompleted.to

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Doesn't  that  create  a moral hazard?[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  In  some  sense, yes!  Turning to  the  nationalscene,  we  are very much in  agreement with the  Greenbook scenario.  Imust  say  that  I have  a lot  of  sympathy  for  the  4 or  5 points  that MikePrell  mentioned  as  potential  sources,  if  you will,  of  upside  risks  tothe  forecast.  We  looked at  some of  those  and thought  that  there  issome  upside  risk here but  also  some  downside risk.  Overall,  though,we thought  that  the  risks were reasonably balanced.  And given wherewe  are  in  terms  of  the  tightness  of  labor markets  and the  basicunderlying strength  of  economic  growth  that  the  Greenbook mentionedand Mike highlighted and that  we also  see  in  our  forecast,  thisbalance of  risk looks  pretty good and the  overall  forecast  lookspretty good.  So,  we  don't have  much to  argue  about with your take  onthe national  scene,  Mike.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  there really has  not been a lotof  change  in  the quite mixed  situation  in our  region  that  I reportedon at  the November meeting.  I would have  to  say, however,  that  thebroad  tone  of  most  of  the anecdotal  commentary we  are  getting is  lessoptimistic  than earlier.  Looking at  the  District's economy sector bysector, retail  activity did rise  somewhat  in  our  latest  monthlyDistrict  survey.  But,  anecdotally,  it's  described as  quite  sluggish.Retailers  express  their usual  concern  about  rising household debt  andconsumer reluctance  to  spend  as  a  consequence of  that.  Some of  thesluggishness  at  the retail  level  is  attributed  to  a lack  of  inventory,especially stocks  of  the  more popular  new model  cars,  but most  of  it12/19/95-15-is  attributed  to  diminishing demand.  Elsewhere, manufacturingactivity, as  indexed by shipments  of  new orders  and so  forth, hasslipped  somewhat  lately.  The  textile  industry, which  is  a veryimportant  industry in  our  region,  is  particularly weak at  the  moment.Finally, construction activity  is  very mixed  in both  the  residentialand commercial  sectors  in  our region.  New construction activity  insome  areas  like  Raleigh  and  the Washington/Baltimore corridor isclearly  strengthening,  but  it's  very sluggish  in  other  regions  likeWest Virginia.  So,  again, we  see a very mixed,  conflictive pictureoverall  as  I reported  last month.With respect  to  the national  economy, probably for  me  atleast  the most  striking point  in  the Greenbook  this  time  is  itsexpectation that  the  third-quarter GDP growth  rate will  be  revised upfrom  the already pretty robust preliminary  figure  to maybe  as  much as5-1/2  percent  on  a fixed-weight  basis.  I guess  we were  supposed  toget  that  figure this  morning.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We won't get  a 1987  dollar  figure.  The waterscould be muddied in  other ways,  but we  do  think  the  third quarterlooks  stronger  than  it  did before.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I am  still  thinking of  it  in  terms  of  those1987  figures  and that  would be a much, much stronger performance  thanI think  anyone was  expecting back  last  summer.  Given  that,  I think akey question at  this point  is  whether  that much stronger quarterlygain will  be  followed by another  stronger-than-anticipated performancein  the  current  quarter.  Not many people  seem to  expect  that.  Ofcourse,  the  staff  revised  its  2.6  percent  growth projection  for  thecurrent  quarter  down  to  1.9  percent  in  the  current  Greenbook.  But  theGreenbook also  suggests  that  there  is  plenty of  upside  risk  in  thatprojection, even though  that  risk is  not getting  much attention  thesedays,  and Mike  underlined  that very eloquently in his  comments  thismorning.  In  particular, as Mike  said, production-worker hours  havebeen growing  at  a healthy pace  lately.  The  staff  is  projecting hoursto  be up  at  over  a 2-1/2  percent  annual  rate  this  quarter.  So,  even avery small  quarterly increase  in productivity could on  the old basisgive  us  a growth  rate  in  the  current  quarter  of  3 percent  at  an annualrate  or  even higher.  We  have  the  very real  possibility, it  seems  tome,  of  two  consecutive relatively strong  quarters despite all  thepessimistic  economic  commentary we read about.  With the  economyalready operating  at  least  in  the neighborhood of  potential GDP,  itseems  to  me  that  that  should be  a source  of  some  concern.The  bottom  line  is  that  there  is  considerable  room forforecast  error  on  either side  of  the staff's  1.9  percent projectionfor  the  current  quarter.  From  a policymaking perspective,  the picturehopefully should become considerably clearer  once we have  some  of  thedata  for  the  month of  December.  We will  be  getting that  informationnot  too many days  down the  road.One  final  comment:  It  disturbs me  a  little  that  the  staff  isstill  projecting an essentially flat  3 percent  inflation rate  throughthe  forecast horizon ending in  1997.  I am not  questioning theprojection.  I am  just  stating  that  I don't  like  it  very much.  Since3 percent  is  such  a mild rate  compared to  our  experience over the  last15-20  years,  I think  a lot  of  people--not around  this  table--areprobably  fairly comfortable with that  scenario.  But  it's worth12/19/95-16-remembering,  if  I have  calculated this  right,  that  at  a 3 percentannual  inflation  rate  the  price level  doubles  in  something  like  23-1/2or  24  years.  Moreover,  a reasonable confidence  interval  around  a 3percent  point  forecast would  certainly include  at  least a  3-1/2percent  rate  of  inflation, maybe  something more  than that.  That's  notprice  stability.  I don't  think we  should be  satisfied with  it.  Inthat  regard, Mr.  Chairman, we  talked in  July  about  the possibility  ofadding a  longer-term inflation  objective  to  our monetary  aggregatetargets  to make  our  longer-term strategy more meaningful.  I wouldhope  that we might  have  an opportunity to  resume or  reopen  thatdiscussion when we  look at  longer-term issues  at  the next meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I have  four  general  points  tomake  today.  The  first  is  that  the  Eighth District  economy continuesto  grow at  a moderate pace.  District  retailers  expect  this  holidayseason  to  be  somewhat better  than last  year's.  About  half  of  Districtauto  dealers  report  autumn  sales  levels  above those  of  last  year,  andto  the extent  sales  have been damped, one  often-cited  factor has  beenshortages  of  popular  trucks  and mini  vans.  Industry  contacts continueto  report  slow, steady growth,  although  contractions  continue in  theapparel,  shoe manufacturing, and coal  mining industries.  The pace  ofresidential  construction has  slowed  slightly, but multifamilyconstruction  is  picking up  the  slack  in  some  areas.  Nonresidentialconstruction  continues  to  be  a bright  spot  in  many parts  of  theDistrict.  Overall  loan demand  remains  healthy with  some  signs  ofsoftening,  and District  banks  continue  to  post  record profits.  Imight mention  that  a couple of  bankers  on our  board expect  a possiblemini  mortgage refinancing boom  to  get  started early next  year.  Thereis  some  evidence of  that  starting now.  An  informal  survey  of  Districtcontacts  reveals  that  labor problems  of  various  kinds,  such asshortages,  unqualified applicants,  and retention are  affecting manybusinesses.  Reports  of  tight  labor markets,  defined as  a shortage ofavailable qualified workers,  are  concentrated  in areas  in  the  southernparts  of  the  District,  especially northwest and  central Arkansas,northern Mississippi,  and western Tennessee.  Some  contacts believethe  shortage  is  so  acute now that  it  is  discouraging firms  fromexpanding operations  or  setting up new operations  in  the  affectedareas.  An added number  of  firms  have  begun to  import  foreign  labor  tofill  positions.My second major point  is  that  the  long-term inflation outlookis  inconsistent with  the  Committee's price  stability goals.  Thecentral  concern  of  the  FOMC should be progress  toward price  stabilityand there  seems  to  be  little public  confidence  that  substantial gainson  this  front will  be made  anytime  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Somelong-term inflation  forecasts with horizons  of  five years  or more haveindeed been adjusted downward  over  the last  year.  But generally  theseforecasts  still  show that market participants  expect  inflation atcurrent  levels  well  into  the next century.  One  such  forecast wasreleased  in  October by  the  Blue  Chip  group.  Their consensus  forecastis  for consumer price  inflation to  average  about  3.2  percent  annuallythrough  the year  2006.  The Livingston  Survey of  Economists  releasedyesterday predicts a  similar 3 percent  rate over  the  same  period,while  the University  of  Michigan Survey of  Consumers  has  the  same  3percent  figure,  according to preliminary  December  data.12/19/95-17-In  addition,  wage pressures may not  remain  quiescent over  thenext  year, which  is  something  that  I think we  all  have been puzzledabout  to  some  extent  given the  reported tightness  in  labor markets  forsome  time.  The  recent  settlement with workers  at  Boeing was,  in  theview of  some  of  our  directors,  surprisingly  rich.  As  Bob Parrymentioned, it  included a lump  sum payment  of  10  percent  in  the  firstyear, a  4-1/2 percent  lump  sum payment  in  the  second year,  generalwage increases  of  3 percent  in  years  three  and  four,  and, I haven'tbeen able  to  nail  this  down,  but one  individual  mentioned  to  me  thatthese  general  wage increases  appeared  to  be  on  top  of  cost-of-livingincreases.  I will  have  to  try  to nail  that  down.  Finally,  there wasa major  reversal  on  company plans  to  shift  more medical  costs  toemployees.  They have  gone from  trying to  shift  costs  on  insuredhealth  care  to  the  employee  to  actually paying  a  substantial bonus  ifemployees  opt  for HMOs,  and  they have not  shifted  any costs  to  workerson the  traditional  plans.  I am afraid that  this  settlement could be  aharbinger  of  things  to  come.  Stubbornly high  inflation  expectationsand possible  future wage  increases  have  led me  to  view the  currentsituation as  a window of  opportunity.  Ed Boehne mentioned  fluidexpectations.  I think  that had  to  do  with the  real  side.  I wouldalso  say that  expectations  could be  quite  fluid with respect  toinflation.  Moves  now  to place  downward pressure  on inflationexpectations  might pay handsome dividends  in  the  future.  The  FOMC,and I agree with what  Al  Broaddus said a minute  ago,  should  develop  aplan  to move  further  toward price stability  and offer markets  someconvincing evidence  that  we  intend to  achieve  such a goal  in  areasonable timeframe.  I think  some  specific  objective would go a  longway  in  that  direction.My third major point  is  that  the national  economy seems  to begrowing near  the  post-war average.  Most private  forecasters  predictstable and  sustainable growth  in  real  output  through  1997.  The  BlueChip group,  for  example,  foresees growth  of  about  2-1/2 percentthrough  the end of  1996,  and a majority of  respondents  expect growthto  continue  into  1997.  The unemployment  rate  is  low and beliespredictions of  imminent weakness.  The  index  of  leading  indicators,  ofcourse, has  been  falling  through most  of  1995,  but  almost all  of  thismaterials.  The  rate of  increase  in  these  materials  prices,  I think,has  merely been tapering off  from the  very rapid pace  set  in  1994  andin fact  could be  interpreted as  a positive  factor for  the  economy, nota negative.  The  rally in  longer-term bonds  is  mostly good news  for1996  growth prospects.  It  should help  the housing  industry as well  asbusiness  investment and may  lead, as  I mentioned before,  to  a new waveof mortgage  refinancing.My final  point  is  that  recent  trends  in  financial marketsseem  consistent with continued expansion, which  I think is  a pointMike  made  earlier  in his  briefing.  Aggregate credit  remains  readilyavailable  even though growth  in  total  bank  loans  has  slowed recentlyas  firms  have  turned to  longer-term capital  markets.  In  addition,  thegrowth  in M2  since  the beginning of  1995  seems  consistent with aneconomy growing at  potential.  The marked runoff  in  total  reservesover  the  last  two years, albeit  distorted by the  spread of  sweepaccounts,  is  a cause  for concern.  On balance, however,  growth  in  themonetary aggregates  supports  an  expectation of  continued moderateexpansion in nominal  GDP.  Thank you.12/19/95-18-

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Let me  start  by sayingthat  I agree  with Mike's  comment  that  the expansion  at  the nationallevel  has  not  run  out  of  steam and  that  it  will  continue.As  far  as  the  Ninth  District  economy  is  concerned,  it  remainsin pretty  good  shape,  although  the anecdotes  this  time  around areperhaps  a bit more mixed  than  they have  been  in  a while,  and  I willcomment  on  that.  Retailers,  of  course,  express  concern.  That goeswith  the  territory  to  some  extent.  I think  the concern  also  reflectsthe  fact  that  there  are simply more of  them, and  they are  gettingsmaller  shares  of  a growing market.  That  is  part  of  what  is  going onhere.  Certainly, some  of  the  large  auto dealers  in  our District  pointout  that  a  shortage  of  sports  utility vehicles  in particular  isrestraining sales  from what  they otherwise  would be.  I happened  to  beat  a meeting with a variety of  real  estate and construction tycoonswhose business  is  concentrated, but not  exclusively,  in  the  TwinCities metropolitan area.  They were all  smiles,  because  1995  was  avery good year for  these people,  though not  a record year.  Thisincluded everything  from  single-family  and multifamily developers  onup  through commercial  construction,  large-scale projects,  and  soforth.  They seem very comfortable with the  outlook  for  1996.  I wouldsay  that  they were  confident  that  they were  going to  have  another goodyear.As  has  been the  case  for quite  some  time,  labor  markets  inthe District  are  tight.  There  are  shortages  of  skilled  and unskilledworkers  in various  parts of  the  District.  As  Tom Melzer mentioned  forhis  District,  I think  the  shortages  are  constraining  expansion  in  someparts  of  our District.  That  also  has  started to  translate  into  moresigns  of  wage pressures  than  formerly was  the  case.  It's  by no  meansuniversal, but I did hear more  about  sizable wage  increases  recentlythan  I had earlier.  The principal  area  of  concern  is  inmanufacturing.  Even  those  manufacturers  who have had a pretty goodyear in  1995,  and  there is  quite  a number  of  them,  say that  ordershave  slowed,  and they express  some  concern about  1996.  I have  a  sensethat  inventories  are higher  in  a large part of  manufacturing thanmanagers would like  them  to be.  They intend, of  course,  to pare  thoseback, but  that  implies  that  the manufacturing  sector could remainsoggy  for  some  time.  That  seems  to me  to  be  the principal  area  ofsoftness  at  the moment.I think Mike  Prell's  commentary about  inflation and the  riskson  the up side  is  well  taken.  But  I wonder  if  there  isn't  an equallygood case  to  suggest  that maybe we are  going  to  do better on  inflationthan the  published  forecasts  suggest.  If  I wanted to  make  that  case,I would point  to  the  following  factors.  They are  not  additive;  I willjust  throw them out  as  factors.  One  is  a number  of  consecutive yearsof modest  growth  in  the money  supply measures.  The  second  is  my sensethat productivity has  done better  than  anticipated and probably betterthan measured  in many cases.  This  is  something  that may wellcontinue.  Third,  I think we  are going to  get  a continuation ofrestrictive fiscal policy.  It  may be back loaded and all  of  that,  butI think it  is  still  likely to  occur.  Finally,  I have a  sense  thatmore  and more central  banks  around  the world  are  committed  to  lowinflation policies.  Ultimately,  that  matters.  So,  I think one  can12/19/95-19-make  a case  that  the  inflation  outlook based  on those  factors  may be  abit more promising  than we  might  otherwise  expect.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  the  level  of  economic  activity  inthe  Seventh  District  continues  to  be  somewhat higher  on balance  thanthat  for  the nation,  but  the  recent pattern of  slowing growth  seems  toparallel  what  is  happening nationally.  I should note  that  ourdirectors  at  their meeting  last  week expressed  somewhat more  concernabout  the  District  and national  economies  than  they had  in  recentmonths.  Mr.  Chairman, you heard those  comments  firsthand bytelephone.Reports  from District  retailers  have been mixed, withnational  chains  continuing to  report  that  sales  at  their  storeslocated  in  the District generally  are  slightly stronger than  theirsales  nationally.  Several  retailers  reported that  price-consciousconsumers have  been hesitant  during  this  holiday  shopping season,hoping  to  get  even better deals  as  the  season  draws  to  a close.Promotional  activity and discounting have  been intense  this  year, asEd Boehne mentioned, not  only  because consumer spending growth hasslowed but also because  of  overcapacity in  the  industry,  as  Gary Sternmentioned.  But  there  is  one piece  of  good news.  Some  of  this  excesscapacity in  the  Chicago  area has  been  taken up by a dramatic  surge  insales  of  anything with  the name Northwestern University on  it[Laughter],  particularly when  it  has  roses  on it,  to  celebrateNorthwestern's  first  trip  to  the  Rose Bowl  since  1949.In  the District's  housing  sector, which has been  quitestrong,  home  sales  and starts  have  softened recently,  in part  due  tothe adverse  weather.  In  contrast  to  a decline nationally, housingpermits  in  our region actually moved up  in  October.  So,  our regionalsuggested.  In  terms  of autos  and  light  trucks,  the  situation has  notchanged  significantly  since our  last meeting.  This  is  still  an areaof  concern.  While  it's  too  early to  get  a good fix  on December  sales,industry contacts report  that  the current pace  is  in  line  with orslightly higher  than  the November  level.  Despite  some  improvement  insales  rates  since October, production plans  for  light  vehicles  throughthe  first  quarter  have been pared back gradually as  inventories haveclimbed  this  quarter.  For manufacturing generally, the momentum  thatwas  developing this  fall appears  to  have dissipated somewhat  inexample,  indicate  that  overall activity  in  the  region's manufacturingsector  flattened out  in November  after having  expanded in  October.However, we  do have  advance  information  on the  Chicago PurchasingManagers'  Index that  will  be  released to  the public  at  the end ofreleased until  the end of  this month.  Steel  shipments continue  athigh  levels  in  the  fourth quarter,  led by demand  in construction-related markets.  Overall  demand  growth, however, has  slowed  in recentmonths.  I have been talking  to  people  in  the steel  industry recentlyand,  of  course,  their  main concern is  that prices  are  soft  in  theirindustry, in  part due  to  the  slower growth  and in part  due  to  the newcapacity  that  is  coming on  stream.  Another reason that  steel  pricesare  expected  to  continue  to  be  soft  is  that  the  integrated producers12/19/95-20-now have  labor  contracts  that prevent  them  from  laying off  employeesregardless  of  production levels.  So,  even  if  they  close down  blastfurnaces,  they  still  have  these  employees  on  the payroll  and,  ofcourse,  this  encourages  them  to  continue producing at  very highlevels.  That  contract provision was  negotiated in  1993.  Laborwell  below  the national  average,  and we  are  still  receiving somereports  of  rising wage pressures,  especially  for  low-skill,  entry-level  jobs.  Price patterns  in  the  District do  not  seem  to  havechanged much since  our last  meeting.  Natural  gas  prices  increasedsharply with  the  cold weather in  November and early December, but  thisis  viewed as  a short-term phenomenon.Turning  to  the  national picture,  we  see  the economy  growingnear  its  potential over  the next year but perhaps  slightly below theGreenbook path.  CPI  inflation should continue  around  2-3/4 percent,which  is  basically similar  to  the Greenbook assessment.  This  view ofthe  economy is  shared by other  economists  in  our  District who  attendedour ninth  annual economic  outlook symposium earlier  this month.  Themedian forecast  of  this  group  of  33  economists was  for  real  GDP  toincrease  2.4  percent  over  the  four quarters  of  1996,  the CPI  to  rise2.8  percent  over  the  same  period, and unemployment  to  average  5.8percent  in  the  fourth quarter  of  next year.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President McTeer.

MR. MCTEER.  The  economy  in  the  Eleventh District  continuesto  be  healthy.  Throughout 1995,  we  kept hearing  that  employmentgrowth had  slowed in  our  District and that  we were converging  towardthe  slower  rate  of  growth  in  the  nation  as  a whole.  These Districtestimates kept being  revised up.  Through October,  employment growthhas  been  about  3 percent  for  the year,  about double  the rate  of  thecountry as  a whole.  Reports  from  our  directors  and Beigebook contactssuggest  moderate to  strong growth  across virtually all  the DallasDistrict.  We had a joint  board meeting  last  week of  all  of  ouroffices,  and the  reports were  quite upbeat.  The directors  from themajor  cities  in Texas  were  competing with each other  in claiming  thattheir  local  economies  were  stronger and  that  they were more  on  theleading edge  of  high tech.  It's been quite  a while  since  there hasbeen  that  sort  of  competition and optimism in  our District.  Therewere  some  exceptions,  though.  Retail  is  doing poorly.  Agriculturehas  been hurt by  low beef prices,  especially low beef prices  relativeto  grain  prices, and by boll  weevils  in  the cotton  fields.  Our  areasalong  the Mexican border  are  flat overall, with weak retail resultsbeing offset  by strong construction  activities  related to  themaquiladora  operations on  the Mexican side  of  the border.  Thesefactories  continue  to  expand as  they benefit  from  the weak peso  andthe  resulting low wages  in  dollar  terms.  Our  friends  attell  us  that  sales  in recent weeks have  been absolutely terrible,  withgeneral merchandise  and apparel  sales  being at  recession levels.  Myconcern  is  that  this  weak performance will  pass  through  to  reducedorders,  a rundown  of  bloated inventories,  production cutbacks,  and allthe  rest.I fear  that  without  some  reduction of  monetary restraint, theeconomy at  the  national  level  could run out  of  momentum before verylong.  I think our research  economists would almost without  exception12/19/95-21-agree  with Mike  Prell's  five points.  My  instinct  is  that  the  downsiderisks  are  somewhat  greater  than  that.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Tenth  District economy remainsstrong  overall, with only  a couple of  our directors  indicating someevidence  of  slight  slowing.  Payroll  employment  in  the  District,  forexample,  has  been growing  at  a  fairly healthy pace with  gains  in  allour  District  states.  Among other  signs  of  strength, Districtmanufacturers  continue  to  operate  at  levels near  or at  capacity,especially in  our  durable  goods  industries.  Our directors  also reportthat  retail  sales  appear  to  be holding up  during  the holiday season,although sales  probably will grow less  than they did a year  ago  insome  areas.  Finally, construction activity has been brisk throughoutour District,  typically the  building of  roads  and other publicinfrastructure.  While  the economy  in  the Kansas  City District  appearsto be  generally strong,  a few  sectors  are  giving  us some  mixedsignals.  One  of those,  of  course,  is  the  farm economy, which  has beenhelped by higher crop  prices,  but  financial  losses  continue to  hurtthe cattle  industry, which  is  a very important  industry within  ourregion.  While oil  and gas  drilling activity has  picked up  recently,the  District energy  industry remains  lackluster overall,  with  theworkforce continuing to  shrink somewhat.The  final point  I would make  on  the  District  is  that,  to  dateat  least,  upward pressure  on  wages  and prices  has  been  limited.  Laborrising wages,  though  evident,  still  remain scattered.For  the  national  economy, I believe  that,  given  currentpolicy, conditions are  such  that  growth  for  the  next  several  quarterswill be  about  2 to  2-1/2  percent and inflation will  be  3 percent,perhaps a  little  less.  In  this  environment,  moreover,  economicresources  will  continue to  be used at  or near  capacity levels.  Alittle  concern has been raised here  about  consumer  spending and  fiscaldrag.  As  for  consumption, I think  it  certainly needs  to be  monitored,but  I believe  it  can be  maintained at  levels  consistent with theincome growth projected  in  these GDP  forecasts.  Consumer debt, whileit  indeed has  increased relative  to  income,  is  not at  historicalpeaks, and  I think it  would allow consumption to  continue upward.Also,  if  we  assume that  consumer debt  burdens  are  excessive, I am notsure  that monetary policy can address  that  issue  in  the  longer run.As  regards  fiscal  policy,  I agree  that  the budget  debate should not bea consideration  for us.  Reasonable  estimates  suggest,  though, thatthe deficit reductions  in 1996  are  likely to be  quite  small.  Thus,any drag on  the  economy  from  fiscal  actions will be  limited in  theforeseeable  future at  least.  I also would point  out  that  lower yieldsin  long-term debt markets  have been  stimulative.  That  suggests  to methat  in  the  context  of  developments  in  those  markets  our policy hasbeen neutral  and not  slightly tight.  Thus,  overall,  we  have aneconomy  slowing  to potential  and  inflation capped at  only 3 percent,and that  is  something that  I think we  should keep  in mind as  we  goforward.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  Southeast  continuesto  grow at  a rate  that  appears  to  be  above  the  national  average.  Thusfar, no  sector appears  to be  overextended.  Wage  and price pressuresare  stable.  Our  District's pretty extensive manufacturers'  surveyshows  no net  movement  in  either  input  or  final  goods prices.  Thescattered  labor  shortages  that  we  saw earlier  this year, particularlyin  the Atlanta  and Nashville  markets,  appear  to  have  abated withoutany persisting effect  on wages.  This  time  of  the  year we,  likeeveryone  else, have  been watching  retail  activity.  For our District,retail  sales  have been quite  good compared to  last  year  and toexpectations,  especially  for high-end goods  like  jewelry and homefurnishings.  That pattern has been pretty even  across our District.Of course,  auto  sales have  been noticeably weak, as  others haveindicated for  other parts  of  the  country.  I might mention  thatcommercial construction  in  the  Southeast is  also  quite strong;  thatconstruction activity  is  concentrated in the  retail sector.  While weare  seeing  some  speculative building  of  retail  space, mostly inAtlanta  and Miami,  that  is  not yet  at a worrisome level.  We  also  areseeing expansion of  office and  industrial building, but most of  thatis  on a build-to-suit  basis.  We  see very  little  speculative buildingin the  office market.  As  one might  expect,  Olympic-related buildingand public projects  are  adding measurably  to  activity  in both Atlantaand  surrounding cities  that  are getting  some  draw from  the Olympics.Overall,  the  Sixth District  is  expanding  smartly, although  activityhas  slowed noticeably  from  this  time  last year.  Still,  it  remainshard to  find problems  that  are widespread  or worsening  in  eithereconomic activity or  in pricing practices.As  far  as  the national  outlook  is  concerned, the  Atlantaforecast on  the  surface  is  remarkably similar  to  the Greenbook's:  Itincludes  moderate  growth  in  consumer  spending,  strong but  deceleratingbusiness  fixed investment,  little net contribution  that we  can  see  ineither direction  from net  exports,  and fairly stable  inflation nearthe  3 percent  level.  Neither  forecast  sees  serious  imbalances.Nevertheless,  there  are  differences  in  interpretation between ourforecast  and  the Greenbook  that have  implications  for  our policydiscussion.  I will  say more  about  that  during  the policy go-around.We  interpret  the relatively benign  inflation environment as  being  inlarge measure  the outcome  of  the  last  fifteen years  of  tough  inflationpolicy.  The Greenbook does not  seem as  confident  on that  change.  ButI would also  underscore the point  that  Gary Stern made toward the  endof  his  comments  about  some  of  the  fundamental  changes  that have takenplace and  the  reasons  that  one  can be  optimistic about  the  inflationoutlook.  We  do not  see  the  current  forecast  as  a rigid  limit  onpotential growth.  In  our view, moderate additional growth wouldlikely have  no  effective  inflation cost.  In  that  way, our outlook  issomewhat  different  from the Greenbook  and somewhat  different  from theother comments  that  have  been made around  the  table.  Thank you, Mr.Chairman.

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  it  does  seem that  fourth-quartergrowth  is  somewhat slower  than  the  torrid pace  of  the  third quarter,and that  slowing may be  in  response  to  that  torrid pace.  But  Icontinue to  be  quite optimistic  that  this  slowing  is  not very likelyto  be  indicative  of  an undue weakness  beginning  to  set  in.  Icertainly concur with the  thrust  of  Mike Prell's briefing earlier.  I12/19/95-23-think there  are  some  important  trends  that  are going  to have  an  impactin  the  near  term  and a little  further out  in  the  future  stemming  fromthe  remarkable decline  that we  have  had  in  long-term interest  ratesover the  last year.  We  still  seem  to  be  able  to  create  jobs  in  thiscountry  at  a rate  of  roughly  100,000  per month,  and  the unemploymentrate has  stayed steady at  5-1/2  percent.  Credit  availability stillseems  to  be  quite  ample.  Debt  formation is  going  forward  a bit moreslowly than  the  very rapid pace  of  a  few quarters  ago,  but  that  iswelcome.  Retail  sales  are  certainly unexciting;  the  anecdotalevidence  about Christmas  sales  is  not  strong,  but the most  recentmonthly data  that  we have,  for November, were  really rather  good.  So,that  sector  of  the  economy may be  all  right, and  I think with  thelower  interest  rates,  housing is  going  to be  all  right  and probablyautos as  well.  Consumer  sentiment continues  to  be  strong,  a bit  offits  highs  perhaps  but  still  strong.  So,  these  developments  and othersleave me pretty comfortable with  the Greenbook forecast, whichessentially showed no  change from  November.  I liked it  then  and Ilike  it  now.  Basically, it  calls  for growth near potential  as  thehighest probability.We  have  to  ponder what might  change  this  outlook.  As  far asan upside breakout  goes,  it  is  difficult  for me  to  see where  that  isliable  to  come  from  in  the  foreseeable  future.  I would think  that  anupside  breakout would have a  fairly low probability.  There  is  alwaysthe possibility of  shocks,  and  if  we  get  one  of  those, we  will have  todeal with  it.  But  it  would  seem  to  me  that  if  one wants  to  focus  on aconcern, we  might see  in  the  further  reaches  of  the  forecast period ageneral  exhaustion at  the  margin of  growth-creating  demand, maybe  aweakening of  investment.  I don't  see  that as  a very high probabilityin  the next  several quarters.  But  further out  in  the  forecast  period,I think that  concern grows  because  we  do have  a very mature  expansionon  our hands.On  the  inflation front,  I think everyone  has  remarked, andeveryone realizes,  that  inflation  continues  to  be  remarkably wellcontained.  I am particularly impressed with the way that  unit  laborcosts  continue to  behave.  Productivity  is  still  growing very nicely,and the  ECI  is  flat.  In  the  inflation  area,  the  foreign outlookcertainly appears  benign,  and commodities generally have behaved wellrecently.  In  sum,  I just  don't  see  strong pressures  on policy at  thistime,  one  way or  the other.  This  leaves us  with the  rather rareluxury of  having  a bit  of  rather  low-risk discretionary room tomaneuver.  I think  the  question for  the  next half  of  the meeting isgoing  to  be  how we  intend  to use  that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Although we  haveobtained a  significant  slug of  new data  on the  economy since  our  lastmeeting, my view concerning the  outlook has  changed very little.  Icontinue  to  think  that  the  inflation outlook  is  favorable,  that  growthis  likely to  proceed at  a moderate pace  over  the next  year, and thatunder current monetary policy, there will be  a bias  toward below-trendgrowth over  the  longer term.  With respect  to  inflation,  I have beenparticularly  impressed by the  decline  in  inflationary expectations,which  Bob Parry mentioned.  Both  long-  and short-term inflationaryexpectations  have  fallen about  1/2 percentage  point since  the  secondquarter  of  1995.  Direct measures  of  inflationary expectations12/19/95-24-suggest,  I think,  a dwindling  fear  of  an  inflation breakout  on  thepart  of  both  households and  forecasters,  and  that  is  a change  inperception  that  is  well  warranted.  We  should  remember  that  suchexpectations  do have  at  least  some  direct  impact  on workers'  demandsfor wage  increases  and the  willingness  of  firms  to  grant  them at  anygiven  level  of  labor market  slack.  So,  reduced  inflationaryexpectations  make  a direct  contribution  to  an  improved inflationoutlook.  As  Bob  also mentioned,  the decline  in  inflationaryexpectations  means  that  real  interest  rates, both  long- and  short-term, have  not declined  as  much as  nominal  interest  rates.  Now, Ihave  no  quarrel with  the short-term outlook  in the  Greenbook, althoughI do  think the  jury  remains  out  on whether or not  inventory adjustmentis  going to  proceed along  the very benign path that  is  projected inthe Greenbook.  But really my most  important  concern has  to  do withthe  longer-term outlook, not  for  1996  but  into  1997  and beyond.  Ithink  that  should be  the  focus  of  our deliberations  since  that  is whenthe  monetary policy changes  we  undertake now will  really  take hold,given  the  long lags  in policy.  My reasoning here  is  similar  to  thatoffered by Larry Meyer  in his  latest  forecast.  According  to  hischaracterization, the  outlook  is  for what  he calls  a  soft  landing withbias.  After a period of  near-trend growth  in  1996,  he  foresees a biastoward below-trend growth  thereafter with  rising unemployment,assuming  that  the  real  federal  funds  rate  is  kept  at  its  currentlevel.  Similarly, our  own MPS model  contains  such a bias  towardbelow-trend  growth under the  Greenbook  fed  funds  assumption, althoughit  does  project an  even  stronger  1996  than  the  Greenbook due to  thelagged but  temporary  influence of  wealth  effects  from  the  stockI thought  I might  enumerate  some  of  my reasons  for  expectingthis bias  toward below-trend growth,  and  I will  just  quickly mentionseven  factors  that  are  operative in  my view.  The  first  is  that  lowerlong-term rates  have been boosting  residential construction with alag, and  I would expect,  as  does  the  Greenbook, that  that  effectultimately will peter  out.  Second,  we are  finally seeing  a cessationof  the at  least year-long  trend toward  easier  credit terms,  and thatmeans  that  one  source  of  stimulus  that  has been working as  an offsetto monetary policy  over  the  last year will  stop  imparting  furtherimpetus  to  aggregate  demand.  Now, we can dispute  whether and how muchstock prices  matter  to  consumption, but  if  higher  stock prices  arecontributing and will  continue  to  contribute in  1996  to  strongconsumption growth, eventually this  influence  is  going to  subside.  Ithink  it will  be  gone by the  end of  1996  even assuming  there  is  nomajor market  correction.  Fourth, pent-up demand  for  consumer  durablesis  presumably spent,  and it  seems  to  me  that  rising delinquencies  onconsumer debt  coupled with higher debt  service  ratios  suggest  at  aminimum  less  robust consumption growth  going  forward.  Fifth,  thegrowth in business  fixed investment  seems  likely to  wane  throughaccelerator effects.  Sixth,  the  lagged  effects  of  the depreciation ofthe dollar,  which should  stimulate exports  in  1996,  will  be  peteringout  in  1997  and thereafter under  the Greenbook  assumption of  a stabledollar.  Finally,  seventh,  I would mention  that  fiscal drag will,  ofcourse,  be  at work throughout  and beyond  the  forecast horizon.So,  it  becomes  hard for me  to  see exactly what  is  going  tokeep the  economy growing at  trend over  the  longer haul.  In addition,if  consumption spending,  in  contrast to  the Greenbook assumption,  iscurrently being buoyed by the  strong performance  of  the  stock market,12/19/95-25-then  any significant  stock market  correction  imparts  some  downsiderisk  to  the  forecast.  There  is  consistent empirical  evidence  in  favorof  the MPS  model  assumption  of  a marginal propensity  to  consume  of  4or  5 percent  out  of  added wealth.  If  we  take  that  seriously--obviously we  can  dispute  that--it makes quite  a difference.  Inparticular,  a 10  percent  correction of  the  stock market  would add ahalf percentage point  to  the  unemployment rate  after 6 to  8 quarters.So,  clearly, the  view  that policy  is  restrictive  at  this  stageinvolves  a difficult  and tricky judgment  call.  I think type  I andtype  II  errors are  both possible.  The  Greenbook does  offer  a verycoherent defense  of  the  opposing view, and I think Mike defended  thatview vigorously.  Fortunately for us,  monetary policy  is  a  flexibleinstrument;  it  can be adjusted in  either  direction  so  that  anymistakes  we might make are  reversible.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy has  beenconsiderably  stronger than we might have  expected, with  growthprobably exceeding  5 percent  for  the  third quarter  and higher  than 3percent,  or  at  least in  the vicinity of  3 percent,  for  the year  1995.The question  for  us  is  how much momentum we  can expect  going forward.There are  some  sources  of  strength to  the  economy.  One area  is  thelabor market.  At  5.6  percent unemployment,  people  are working.  Theybe willing to  move, which suggests  in  turn more flexibility  in  thelabor  force  than  is  implied by a 5.6  percent  unemployment  rate.  Ithink the proof  of  this  assertion is  the  fact  that  wage  rates have notconsistently been under pressure.  We have  heard a  lot  of  anecdotalstories  about labor  shortages,  but  that has  not  been widespread norhas  it  crept  into  the  statistics.With  respect  to  consumer  spending, we clearly are gettingsome  mixed signals  in  both  the published  data and  in  the  anecdotalreports.  We probably have,  as  Janet Yellen mentioned, worked  throughthe pent-up  demand  for  durables.  Consumers  appear  to  be very priceconscious  and cautious;  consumer  debt  is  probably reinforcing thiscaution.  It  is  pretty  difficult to  assess  the  fourth-quarter retailsituation.  People  are probably waiting until  that  last  storecatalogs.  But  as  long  as people  are working,  I don't  think  there  isany reason to  assume  that  they will  stop spending  in any big way.  Ithink  it  is  fair  to  say that  growth  in  consumer  spending is  likely toapproximate  the pace  of  income  growth.  So,  the upside  surprises  inthis  sector of  the  economy are  unlikely.The housing  side has been disappointing  recently, but  I don'tsee  any reason why  it  should not pick up  a bit,  or  at  least notof reasonably low mortgage rates.  On  the business  investment  side,the  fundamentals  are  reasonably strong  for  continued investment,though probably not  at  the strong pace  that we  saw in  1994  and early1995.  Profits  and cash  flows  are  holding up and  the cost  of capitalis  low.  The markets,  I think, are  fairly supportive of  moderateeconomic  growth.  The  stock market  is  strong,  generally supported bycorporate  earnings.  I guess  I am not  quite  as  pessimistic as  BillMcDonough about  the  stock market being massively  overvalued.  In  thedebt market,  we have  seen  the  emergence of  a  flatter yield curve.  It12/19/95-26-has  not yet  turned negative,  but  it  definitely has  flattened out.  Atthe  long-term end,  the  decline  in  inflation  expectations has  someobvious benefits  for  lowering  financing costs  and  improvingrefinancing opportunities.  In  the  inflation  area,  we have  seen moreprogress  than we  probably have  a right  to  have  expected.  In  short,there  are no  obvious bottlenecks  or major  imbalances  in  the  economy.This  is  not  to  say that  there  aren't  any risks  to  the economy, andthere may be  some  adjustments  forthcoming.  The manufacturing  sector,as  has  been reported around  the  table  today,  is  pretty uneven.  We  maystill  have  to  work off  some  inventories.The  international  demand  side,  I think, is  a bit more  risky.Certainly, the United  States  is  in  a better  competitive  situation  thanhas  been  the  case historically.  But  the  question  is:  Will  theinternational  demand be  there?  The  economic  outlook for  Europe  hasweakened;  the Mexican economy may be bottoming out,  but  there arestill  significant risks;  and it  is  questionable whether Japan hasfully  faced up  to  some  of  its  difficulties.With  respect  to  the  fiscal negotiations,  with a good part ofthe government  still  closed  down, this  remains  a concern.  I wouldargue,  however, that  we know more now  than  we did  at  our meetings  inhave bought  some  time.  Rather,  I should say  that  Secretary Rubin hasbought  some  time, and  there  is  a commitment  to  avoid default.Government  operations  are going  to  reopen  one way or  another.  I thinkpoliticians will  not be  able  to  resist  the political backlash  from  theinability of  the public  to  get  services.  We also  have the  specter  ofpublic  employees  getting a paid holiday.  In  a week or  so,  they willbe  eligible to  file  for  unemployment benefits.  There also will  becomplaints about  the unfairness  of  unpaid  layoffs  for  the holidays.Under  either a  continuing resolution or  an  agreement, which may notcome  until  next year,  there will  be  some  fiscal  drag, but not  thatmuch  in  the near  term.  It  seems  to  me  that  the point  for  us,  withrespect  to  the  fiscal  situation  is  that  the  areas  of  discussion arenarrowing.  From our perspective, I think  there  is  probably moreconfidence that  a deal  eventually will  be  struck, but  there will besome  federal  drag  on  the economy.In  sum,  I think the case  continues  for moderate growth, but  Ithink there clearly will  be  some  unevenness  in that  growth.

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  only new piece  ofinformation of  an  optimistic type  coming  from our District  was areport  that  recent  shipments  and backlogged orders  for candlewickswere at record levels.  [Laughter]  I have not  seen  that  indicatorbefore, and  I don't  know if  staff can attest  to  its  reliability!  Oneof  the  chief  executives of  a major  company said  to me  that  if  we  wantto  avoid a pickup  in inflation, we  need to  ease  monetary policy verysubstantially.  I asked him  to  explain  that.  He  said  that  recentlyhis  sales were off,  orders  for  the first  half  of  next year did notlook very good, earnings were  under pressure,  and  if  things  did notpick up, he  was going  to have  to  raise his prices.  This  is  one  ofthose occasions  where  I regret  that  this  job prevents me  from shortinghis  stock!12/19/95-27-Western Pennsylvania  resembles  what  Ed Boehne was describingfor  his  District;  it  had been relatively  soft  throughout  this periodof  robust  expansion  in  the  rest  of  the Cleveland District.  But  theother parts  of  the  District  including all  of  Ohio  and especiallycentral  and western  Kentucky that  had been  so  strong have  distinctlycooled in  every respect,  especially in  motor vehicles, metals-relatedindustries,  residential  and nonresidential  construction,  and on downthe  list.  One director  reported  that pre-Christmas  retail  sales  werevery disappointing.  A banker  responded that  they have beendisappointing for  the  last  forty  years,  and so  that  exchange didn'tseem  to  add too much to  our knowledge.Two  years  ago  at  this  time,  we  were contemplating  head windsand the  extent to  which  those head winds had diminished sufficientlyso  that  we  could start  to  raise  the  funds  rate  and get  our  foot  offthe gas  pedal  so  to  speak.  Everyone  inside  and outside  the Systemagreed  that  a 3 percent  funds  rate was  simply too  low at  that  time.  Ayear ago  at  this  time,  we were  observing tail winds.  We were  busilyreefing  the main  sails  to  keep them  from gaining  too  much momentum andtrying to  figure out  how high  it  was  going to  be necessary  to  take  thefunds  rate  in  order  to prevent  an  acceleration  of  inflation.  As  itturns  out with the  advantage  of  hindsight,  6 percent  was sufficient.Whether  it  was  more  than sufficient  is  debatable, but  it  was  certainlyadequate  for  this round.  That  says  that  3 percent  was  too  low  andthat  6 percent  was  at  least  sufficiently high,  so  we  have  the  rangebounded.  We  are talking  about where  the rate  should be  in between.Currently, at  least  from my District,  it  feels very much like  the  tailwinds  are  diminishing.  Two years  ago,  our  anecdotal  information putus ahead of  the Commerce Department  or even  the  BLS  statistics  aboutthe  need to  start  raising  the  funds  rate.  A year  ago,  our ownanecdotal  information  or  observations  around  the  System led us  tobelieve  that we were  reaching  the  topping-out point  well  before mostforecasters  were  saying that  we were  going to  stop  raising  the  fundsrate.  Now the  information  from the  majority of  us  around  the  tabletells me  that we  are  a bit  ahead of  the  numbers  in  hand and that  defacto policy has  become more  restrictive.  I think  that  a  5-3/4percent  funds  rate  is  now more restrictive  than  6 percent  was  lastinformation says  to  me that  the  equilibrium real  rate has  moved down,and what we  do about  the nominal  rate  has  become  a question of  timing.Let me make  a normative comment  or  two about  the Greenbookforecast.  I like  the real  growth  rate  and the  employment andunemployment numbers projected  through  1997.  If  they turn out  to beclose to  the mark, I would be very happy with that  result.  As  someothers  have  commented, I don't  like  the  inflation numbers, especiallythe CPI  numbers.  What  is  puzzling is  that  if we  were  targetingnominal  GDP,  I think  the numbers  in  the Greenbook would  look prettyacceptable  to  everybody, with growth in  nominal  GDP getting down to  arate  of  about  4 percent  in  the  second half  of  1997.  If  nominal  GDP  iscruising along  at  about  4 percent,  that  ought  to  get  us  pretty closeto  where we  think we  want  to  be  in terms  of  the  purchasing power  ofthe  dollar.  But  the  CPI  doesn't  show that  kind  of progress  in  theGreenbook projection, and I don't  think the  Greenbook is  internallyconsistent on  the  policy assumption and the numbers  that  are beingproduced there.  I simply don't  believe  that  a nominal  5-3/4  percentfunds  rate out well  into  1997  is  consistent with the  kind  of patternthat  is  being  shown for nominal  GDP.  Like Al  Broaddus or Tom Melzer,12/19/95-28-I would like  to  have  a forecast  that  would move us  in  the  direction  ofprice  stability.  Current policy at  best  is  going  to  be  influencinginflation in  1997  and beyond.  I would like  very much  to  have  aforecast  that  shows  inflation  at about  a 2 percent  rate at  the  end of1997.  The reason we  can't  ask  the  staff  to  produce  such a  forecast  isthat  it  requires us  to  raise unemployment  or  contract  output  or  holdit  below potential.  Since  I don't want  to  do  that,  I can't  ask  thestaff  to produce  a  forecast  of  inflation  that  I can  translate  into  anobjective.  We  have  to  sit  and wait and  hope  that we get  lucky andfind  that  potential  output  turns  out be  higher  than  we  thought, and weget positive productivity surprises  that  produce  lower  inflation.That would be  true  even  if  we were  at  10  percent  inflation.  In  thisframework, once  we  get  to  full  employment  and potential  output,  itdoesn't  matter what  the inflation  rate  is.  We  are  stuck with  itforever until  we produce a recession or  raise  the  unemployment rate.I don't want  to  do  that.  I don't  know how to  end this  process  andestablish an objective of  lowering the  3 percent CPI  to  2 percent  or 1percent or whatever number we  said we were going  to  accept.  I amuncomfortable  with  this  forecast because  I believe  fundamentally thatif  inflation  rates  are  not moving down,  they  are moving up.  Yet,  wehave  an  inflation rate  that  continues  unchanged forever  out  there,  andI find  that  difficult  to  accept.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I am going  to  be  blissfully brief.  As  I satdown last  night  to  write some  notes  for  this meeting,  I rememberedsomething my basketball  coach  taught me  when I was very young aboutshooting  free  throws.  He used to  say:  the basket  is  the  same,  theball  is  the  same, why  can't  you be the  same?  Here we  are  in  December,and I am  thinking back to  November.  The Greenbook  is  the  same,  theeconomy  looks  the  same,  and  I feel  the same  way about  the  economy.  Iwant  to  elaborate on  that  just  a  little.  I want  to  make one  point:As has  been noted by several  people,  the  Greenbook, except  for a  fewtrivial  details,  is  essentially the  same  Greenbook we  had  five  weeksago.  The economy,  I would  say, looks  the  same  as  it  did then,  onlymore  so.  In broad outline, we  were  looking then  at  an  economy thathad shown  a surprisingly  strong third quarter;  now the  third quarterlooks  surprisingly stronger.  The  economy was  showing signals  ofweakening in  the  fourth quarter, which I think have  continued to  comein.  In addition, we had a big question mark about  the budget,  and nowwe have  a huge  question mark about  the budget.  In consequence,  Iessentially feel  the  same way about  the  economy as  I did  five  weeksago,  only more  so.The preponderance of  risks,  as  I said  last  time,  looks  to meto  be  on the  down  side.  I am not  going to  go  into  the details  of whysince you have  already heard that  around  the  table.  I think thebiggest new risk in the  last  five weeks  is  the  additional  inventorypileup  that  seems  to  have  occurred since  then.  I am a bit moreworried about  that  than I was  five  weeks ago.  Secondly,  it  certainlylooks,  as  it  did  five weeks  ago,  that  the  economy  can grow at  trendwith about  5.6  percent unemployment  and about  3 percent  inflation  fora while, maybe  a long while.  But private  forecasts  that  have thisscenario, and many do,  are  almost all  predicated on an  easing  of  Fedpolicy;  the Greenbook  forecast  is  not predicated on  an easing  of  Fedpolicy.  I might  add  that  the  market rallies  that  are propelling  orexpected to  propel  the economy  forward  are  also predicated on  a Fed12/19/95-29-easing.  We  saw a little  of  that  come  out  of  the markets  yesterday.The part of  the  argument  that  said,  "the budget will  be  fixed  andtherefore  the  Fed will  ease"  took  a small  hit  yesterday  in  the market.I think we  got  a little microcosm  of  what might happen  if  in  fact  wedon't  ease.  Thirdly,  the  real  fed  funds  rate  looks  restrictive to  meas  it  did a month or  so  ago.  My notes  here  say exactly what  JerryJordan  said:  It  seems  to  me  that  the  funds  rate  is  more  restrictivenow than  it  was  in February when we  were  actively stepping on  thebrake.  It  is  hard for me  to  understand why in  December we  would wantto be  stepping  on the  brake more  firmly than  we were  in  February.  Ican't  understand that  at  all,  nor could I five  weeks ago.The  only  thing that  I have  to  say today that  is  not a  repeatof  what  I said  five weeks  ago  is  a comment  about wage  pressures.  Thishas  been mentioned  by several  people  around the  table.  We  ought  torecall that  labor  lately has been taking  it  on  the  chin quite badly,despite  apparently  tight  labor markets.  Real  wages  are  going nowhere,and profit margins  are going  everywhere.  One manifestation of  this  isthat  the  gains  from  diminished health  care  costs  are  being pocketed byfirms  in  the  form  of profits, not  by  labor  in  the  form  of  wages,which  is  what  a conventional  theory of  incidence would have led  us  toexpect.  I raise  this point  for  those who have  a fear  of  wagepressures.  I raise  it  to  suggest  that  we ought  to  expect  somereversal  of  this  in  the natural  order of  things.  There  ought  to  be  aperiod  of  time when wages grow  faster than  prices  just  as  there hasbeen a period  of  time  when prices  grew faster  than  wages.  As  thisaberration straightens  itself  out,  and the wage-price relationshipgoes  back to  what most  of  us  think  is  consistent  with  the  normal  long-run  theory of  incidence,  there does  not necessarily have  to  be  anacceleration  of  prices.  It  would  simply be  the relative wage-priceratio  snapping back  toward what  it  was  a  few years  ago.  That  is  all  Ihave  to  say.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Don?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Don,  ignoring lags  and transition problems,  in  afuture  steady state  environment with nominal  spending expanding  at  a  3to  4 percent rate,  output  growing  at potential,  and the  economyperceived  to  be  at  full  employment  with price  stability, in what  ballpark would you guess  the nominal  fed  funds  rate  would fall?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think under  those circumstances  it  would bebelow where it  is  now.  You  are  talking about  2 percentage points  lessinflation  than now, 1 percent  instead of  3 percent.  So,  as  a firstapproximation,  I would shave  2 percentage points  off  the nominal  fundsrate  just  to  keep  the real  funds  rate  from rising, since  inflation  isthat much  lower.  As  to  what  real  funds  rate  is  consistent with theeconomy growing at  its potential, which  is  the other part  of  yourquestion, I think  that  is  really  difficult  to  say.  We have  discussedthat  a couple of  times  over  the  last  six months.  You can  see  that  so-called  equilibrium funds  rate bouncing around  quite a bit  in  any modelsimulation or  any  look  at how the  real  funds  rate  has  behaved over12/19/95-30-time relative  to  how the  economy has  behaved.  We  ran  for much of  the1980s,  certainly  the middle part  of  the  1980s,  with nominal  interestrates  pretty consistently above  the  growth of  nominal  GDP,  though notevery year.  That  pattern was  consistent with a fairly vigorouslygrowing economy and  steady  inflation  in  the  4 to  5 percent  range.Now,  that was associated with  some  fiscal  stimulus,  so  I think we  hada higher  equilibrium  funds  rate  in  that  period.  Most  people  thinkthat  the  equilibrium funds  rate  is  probably down  relative  to  what  itmight  have been  in  the  1980s,  but  how  far down  is  very hard  to  say.The  structure  of  the  economy  and the  structure  of  financial marketshave changed markedly since  the  1950s  and  the  1960s.  We don't haveReg  Q, for  example,  to  cut off  spending when market  rates  get  high.It  is  quite conceivable  to  me that  the  long-run equilibrium realinterest  rate  at steady  inflation  right now would be  higher  than itwas back then.  One could perhaps  run with nominal  interest ratesabove  nominal  GDP  for  awhile;  it  would depend  on  the  stance  of  fiscalpolicy  and the  other things  that  affect  the  economy.  I don't  thinkthere  is  a  simple mapping of  nominal  GDP growth and nominal  interestrates,  although  there  is  a relationship.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Maybe you answered  it  with this  matrix and yourother remarks.  It  is  all  very interesting.  Maybe  I didn't understandwhat  you were saying;  I am  trying  to  clarify it.  Starting  from wherewe  are  today--the perception  of  full  employment,  an economy  operatingat  capacity,  the  current  funds  rate, and  the  inherited inflation rateas  it  is  reported--what  is  the  transition mechanism  for getting  thefunds  rate  from where  it  is  to  where  it  would be  in  a steady  stateenvironment without  creating slack?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  What  is  the  transition mechanism  for gettinginflation down?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  What  are  the  conditions under which you wouldsay, without  economic  slack occurring or being  forecast,  that  we movefrom the  5-3/4  percent  funds  rate to  that  steady state  funds  rate?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think  there  are  two points.  One would be  thatslack occurs  that  you had not anticipated, perhaps  because potentialis  higher  than you  thought  or  there is  a shortfall  in  demand you hadnot  anticipated.  When  that  occurs, you  are  going to  have  a  littleslack  in  the economy.  You react  to  get  rid of  that  slack, butmeanwhile you  are  running below potential  and that  would put downwardpressure  on  inflation.  I think the  opportunistic  strategy here  is  totake  that  downward pressure.  Don't  try to  push the  economy back abovepotential  to make up  for the  output  that  you have  lost  in themeantime.  So  that's  one  source.  Another  source would be  thatinflation  expectations have  come down--something  that,  as  I hear  it,some  of  the people  around  the  table  think has  happened recently.  Ifinflation  expectations have  come  down,  that would put  some downwardpressure  on  the  inflation process.  As  Governor Yellen mentioned inher remarks,  if  they truly have  come  down and particularly if  they arein  the process  of  declining  further,  that  would enable  you  to  hold theeconomy  at  potential  and have  inflation come  down further.  Now,whether you could  logically count  on much  of  this  sort  of  immaculateconception  of  a decline  in  inflation expectations--if you'll  pardonthe  expression--while holding  the  economy at  potential  is  difficult  tosay.  But  that would be  the  other way it  could happen.  You  are  right,President  Jordan,  in suggesting  that  the  economy is  constantly being12/19/95-31-hit  by shocks,  and it  is  not  a question of  deliberately putting  slackin the  economy  to  bring  inflation down.  It  is  a question  of  takingthose  shocks, whether  they  are  on  inflation expectations, demand,supply, or  whatnot,  and using  them  to  bring  inflation down.  Overtime,  if  you react  asymmetrically to  shocks,  strongly  to  upward  shocksand less  strongly to  downward shocks,  the  inflation rate will work  itsway  lower.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Don, without  benefit  of  your  verygood two pages, which would have  saved me  a good  deal  of  work  lastnight,  I spoke  in  favor of  the  opportunistic  approach  this morning.Since  we don't  agree with  the Greenbook,  I guess  our model  would  fitin your matrix  where you have  disinflation pressures  and would  thenmove  down to  the  box that  indicates  a permanent  drop  in  inflationexpectations  and  ergo  a reduction in  nominal  rates  that  leaves  realrates  unchanged.  My question  is,  is  it  safe  to  assume thatopportunistic versus deliberate  are  two  different policies withoutimplying that  one  is  necessarily more virtuous  than  the other?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I am  not  sitting  in  moral  judgment  here.  I thinkit  is  a question of  your  ultimate goal  and the gains  you  think you aregetting  from your ultimate  goal--that  is,  price stability--and thelosses you are  willing  to  incur  to get  there.  If  you  really believethat  1 percent  inflation would produce  over  time  a  lot  higherproductivity, a  lot  higher  output, a  lot more benefit  to  the  economythan  3 percent  inflation,  then  perhaps  deliberately giving up  short-run output  gains would be warranted  to  allow you  to  get  to  1 percentinflation  faster.  If you  are  somewhat  uncertain about  the  net  gainsof  going from  3 percent  to  1 percent  inflation,  it  seems  to me  thatyou are  potentially maximizing society's welfare  by going there  slowlyand  taking advantage  of  the  opportunities of  getting  there withoutnecessarily punishing  the body economic.

Just  a comment:  I think you couldbe  equally convinced  of  the  benefits  of  getting  to  the  low inflationrate  but  just decide  that  the price  of  getting  there  very quickly isexcessive.  There  would be no  difference  in  the  goal,  in my view, onlyin the  speed at  which you are willing  to  get  there  and the  cost  tosociety  that you  are willing  to  incur.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That's a good point.  A  lot of  models put  inutility functions  that penalize  large  misses  from output  more  thansmall misses  from  output.  On  the  other hand,  if  you  think  that  theworld is  pretty  linear  and symmetric,  in  the  end it's not  so  clear.  Ithink it's  an open  question if  you  really want  to  get  there, whethergoing  there  slowly results  in higher  utility for  society  than goingthere quickly, assuming  there  is  a lot  to  be gained when you getthere.  You are giving up  years at  price  stability by going  thereslowly.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Don,  I just  want  to make  sure  that  Iunderstand the paradigm completely, not using  the  current policyissues  so much as  a bit of  recent  history.  I would be  interested toknow, within  the  context  of  this,  how you would  interpret  our  initial12/19/95-32-tightening back  in  1994.  I would have  thought  of  that  intuitively asopportunistic.  As  I recall,  the  inflation rate  was  not  risingsignificantly.  What was  happening  was  that  bond  rates  were backingup.  Some of  us  at  least  had  a sense  that  that  indicated a rise  ininflation  expectations,  and of  course  there was  evidence of  strengthin  the  real  economy.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I would  interpret  it  under 3.b.i.  in my  outline,that  is,  leaning  hard against potential  increases  in  inflation.  Asyou  saw inflation developing, you moved vigorously against  it.  So,  Ithink  it's perfectly consistent with  the  opportunistic  strategy.  Someof  this  may be  a bit endogenous  since  the  people who practice  thatpolicy  are defining  the opportunistic  strategy.  But  as  I defined it--we  are  listening to  you  folks--I  think  that  is  perfectly consistentwith  an opportunistic  strategy:  lean hard against  shocks  in  onedirection,  take a more measured approach  to  shocks  in  anotherdirection.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Don,  I would like  tofocus  on  the middle  column of  your bottom  chart.  Would you  speakspecifically as  to  what  this  column means  to  you  in  the  currentsituation?  When  I look  at  the  Philadelphia  survey of  inflationaryexpectations,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  first  thing to  make  assumptionsabout  is  how much  of  the  drop  is  permanent.  If  I wanted  to  keep  thereal  rate  constant and thought  it  was  all permanent,  I would probablyneed to  reduce  the  rate  by  50  basis points.  If  I wanted  to  take  moreof  a Brainard approach  and not go  the  full  distance,  the  ratereduction  might be  a quarter.  What  does  it  mean to  you?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think that  from the  perspective of  the  realworld situation  of  the  last  six months,  it  is  a  little  fuzzier  than  itseems  in  these boxes.  For one  thing, I  think  the Committeeanticipated a drop  in  inflation and inflation  expectations  when  it  cutthe  funds  rate  in  July.  That's why you did  it.  Inflation had  comeup,  and you could see  that  that  rise wasn't permanent.  It  was goingto  come  down,  and you  expected it  to  come  down.  If  you had notexpected  it  to  come  down, you would not  have  cut  the  funds  rate  atthat  time.  What we  really need  to know is  what  you thought  inflationwould be  when you  cut  that  rate.  Judging  from  the central  tendenciesin  the Humphrey-Hawkins  report,  you  thought  inflation would be  about aquarter point higher  than  it  seems  to  be  turning out  for  1995.Whether that's  what  the market  expected and how your expectationscompared  to  that  is  not  clear.  But  you have  had a  favorable  inflationsurprise  relative  to  your own  expectations  as  given in  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  report.  I just  don't  think  it's  a  full  half point  becausesome  of  that  is  the market  catching up with what  FOMC  members  expectedto  happen.  The  other point, of  course,  is  that  leaving  real ratesunchanged assumes  that  the  intended real  rate was  the right  real  rate.That's  the  other judgment  you have  to  make.  In  fact,  you  have had  alot  more  growth  in  the  second half  of  the year  than you anticipated  inthe  Humphrey-Hawkins  report.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Don, I am a little  surprised that you recommendresponding to  a  supply shock or  a demand shock  in  the same  way in your12/19/95-33-matrix.  I would have  expected different  signs.  The  easiest way  forme to  think about  it  is  to  suppose  the  reverse happens  if  you have  anegative  supply  shock, say an oil  embargo,  versus  a positive  demandshock.  If  you  had a positive  demand  shock, I  think the  rightprescription would be  to  raise nominal  real  rates  because  you wouldwant  to  offset  the  demand.  If  you had an  oil  embargo,  I would notrecommend raising nominal  and real  rates.  In  other words,  I thinkthere  is  a difference.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I am not  sure  I followed you  entirely,  but thereare  a couple  of points.  Part  of  this  is  the  asymmetry of  theopportunistic  strategy.  Several  types  of  supply  shocks  are possible,and I think  that  is  a  complication  as well.  If  you are  looking  at  themiddle  panel  here with a positive  supply  shock, cutting nominal  ratesenough  to  keep real  rates  unchanged is  what  keeps you  at potential,since under  the  opportunistic strategy  the  Committee  is  not  seeking  todrive  the economy  below potential  or have  it  above potential.  On  theother  side,  if  you have  a negative kind  of  supply  shock, you mightwant  to  drive  real  rates  higher  to  lean  against  that  supply shock.That was  the  example  in  3.b.i.  of  my outline where policy attempts  tohold the  line  against  increases  in  inflation by accepting  outputlosses  in  the  event of  adverse  supply developments.  So,  it  seems  tome  that  if  you had an  adverse  supply shock, you would want  to  raisenominal  rates perhaps  by even more  than  the  increase  in  inflationexpectations  in  order  to  raise  real  rates.  This  presumes  that youthought  the  supply shock was  feeding  through to  inflationexpectations,  and you wanted  to  respond so  that  you wouldn't end upwith a higher  inflation rate  at  the end  of  the  day than  when youstarted.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I will  talk  to  you another  time.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  The  answer to  that question  obviously depends,among other things,  on whether you think  the  shock  is  temporary  orpermanent.  That  is  extremely important.  Larry  is  looking at  atemporary shock,  and I believe  Don is  thinking about  one  that  ispermanent.  That  is  not the  only variable but  it  is  critical.I want  to  make a couple  of  points.  First, I think  this  is  avery good discussion  to have.  I only wish  I knew we  were  going tohave  it,  because  I began  thinking about  this  subject only when youstarted  talking.  I have  thought  about  it  before, but not within thelast month.  So,  I hope  this won't  be  the  last  of  it  for  thisCommittee  because  I don't  think  I am  the only  one who didn't  know thatthis  subject would  be  on the  agenda.I have  a couple of  substantive points.  Among theconsiderations  in  choosing between  these  two  strategies are  thefollowing,  though  these are  not  the  only considerations.  Howimportant  do you  think losses  of  output  are?  That  is  very important.And--Don, you  touched  on this  obliquely--what  are  the  relative  socialcosts  of  the level  of  inflation,  especially at  low levels,  and changesin  the  inflation rate?  This  is  critical,  I believe.  Then  there aretechnical  considerations,  and if  I had known about  this  topic  last12/19/95-34-night,  I would have pulled out  the  work that  the  staff  did on  it  andcould be  eloquent  on  the  subject.  The choice  does hinge  sensitivelyon  the marginal  costs,  around  the  target  inflation rate,  of  smalldeviations  in  output and  inflation.  Are  these  costs  linear  orquadratic;  how  is  the  loss  function  curved;  and so  on.  I won't  try  toget  that  right  now, because  if  I try,  I will  probably get  it  wrong.That  is  one  set  of  comments.The  second set  of  comments:  You characterized  theopportunistic  strategy, which like  Bill  McDonough  I favor, as  waitingfor  the unanticipated to  happen.  In  some  sense  that  is  right, exceptthat  we know it  will  happen.  It  is  not  that  we  think we will  go  forthe next  thirty years without  a recession.  We don't  know when therecession will  come,  but we know it  will  come.  We  also know that  whenit  comes, even  if  we are  being opportunistic  the way you  describe  ithere,  we will  not react  fast  enough  to  stop it  in  its  tracks.  So,there  will be  a recession and  there will  be  a period  of  slack.  Thatis  what  a lot  of  us mean when we  say that  we  are  "one recession awayfrom price  stability."  It  takes  a very nimble  central  bank  to movefast  enough  to  avoid  the  slack that  drags  inflation down a point  ortwo points when  a recession occurs.  It  will happen  with a probabilityof  one.  So,  it  is  not unanticipated  in  some  long-run  sense;  it  isunanticipated  only as  to  the  timing.  That's  crucial because,  if  itwas  literally unanticipated, you might never get  to price  stability bythe  opportunistic  strategy.I also  have  a couple  of  quarrels with  the way I think youportrayed the  strategy.  Although  in your  discussion with Jerry Jordanit  went  the  other way,  I thought you  said you were  looking back atinflation performance  rather  than  looking  forward  at  inflationaryexpectations.  I would have  thought you  would have wanted  to  do  thelatter--to  look  forward  at  inflationary expectations,  not backward atthe  actual performance.  Secondly,  I think your matrix, as  I think  ofit,  is  not  quite right  in  terms  of  changes  versus  levels.  That  is,"tighten" or  "tight"  and  "easier" or  "easy,"  so  to  speak, are  twodifferent things.  I would have  thought  the  question was whether youwanted to  be  "tight"  or  "easy."  I can imagine  easing  from a verytight position, and  I can  imagine tightening  from  an easy position.Either  could still  leave policy on  the  same  side  of  neutral.  I thinkthe  critical distinction here  is  which  side  of neutral  are we  on,  andwhich do we wish  to  be on.  In  that  regard, we cannot  avoid taking  astand,  to  use a well  worn phrase,  even  though we  know we don't  knowfor  certain what  the equilibrium real  interest  rate  is.  That  is  ourchoice.  Do we want  to  be on  the north  side or  the  south side  of  theequilibrium real  rate?  Once we put  ourselves  there,  the  restbasically will  take  care of  itself  if  we are  right, but with very longlags  and uncertain  timing.  If  we  are close  to  equilibrium,  it  isgoing to  be uncertain  as  to  whether we are  on  the  right  side because,as  I said, we don't  actually know the equilibrium  real  rate.  But  thefact  that we  can't  know this number  with certainty doesn't  avoid theneed  to  estimate  it.  It  is  the  same  sort  of  uncertainty  that  we  faceall  the  time.  We don't know what  the economy  is  going  to  do  in  thenext  six months,  but we have  all  these people  here  to  estimate what  itis  going  to do  in  that period.My last  remark will  tie  that  to  the  current  situation.  Ithink that  right  now we  are  in  a deliberate  strategy posture, since  Ibelieve,  as  many but  not all  of  those around  the  table  believe,  that12/19/95-35-we  are  on  the north  side  of  the  equilibrium real  funds  rate.  Aversion of  the deliberate  strategy  is  to  hold  the  funds  rate unchangedand  let  the  economy do  what  it  will,  which is  to  create  slack  andbring  the  inflation rate  down.  Whereas  the  opportunistic  strategy, asBill  characterized it,  would ease  now  and presumably try  to  bring  thereal  fed  funds  rate  to  roughly what  you  think the  equilibrium rate  is.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I thought  in  effect  that's  what  I had in  the  lowerrow here.  One way  to  think about  this--the way  I thought  about  it  asI was writing  it--was  that  the upper row had the  Greenbook assumptionand the  equilibrium real  rate  approximately where  it  is  now.  Thelower  row had some  words  like  this--

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I would have  labeled the  top  row as  having  areal  equilibrium short  rate  of  2.75  percent  and the  bottom row ashaving  a rate  of  less  than  2.75  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That's  exactly what  I had in mind.  I was nottaking a stand  since  I had  two  alternatives here,  but  I think  thosenotions  of  the  real  rate were  behind  these  alternatives.  I want  to  goto  one  other  comment  that  you made  because  I think it  raises aninteresting  issue  that  I tried  to point  out as  we were  going  throughthis.  The question  of why you  take disinflation but you don't  seekdisinflation  does  rest  on  these  points  about  the  utility of  lessinflation and how much is  gained  or  lost by different  actions  relatingto  the  level  of  inflation versus  a change  in  inflation or  the  level  ofoutput  versus  movement of  output  away from potential.  I think  theseare  the  sorts  of  things  we  need to  think more  about  to write down  amodel  in  which we  really can  be  confident.  I agree  that my colleagueshave  written down  an  interesting model  that  produces  this  result,  butit  is  that  issue  that  I think is  the most  difficult  to  confront whenyou  are  talking  about  the  opportunistic  strategy.  I think we  talkedabout  this  at  the  September meeting.  If  the  Mack bill  ever  becomeslaw,  the  Committee will  need to  confront  these  issues:  Why are youdoing  this  deliberately?  Why are  you not  doing  this  deliberately?Why do you have  the  opportunistic  approach?  Is  it  worth  going toprice  stability?  Why  not  get  there?  This  question of  justifying  thisopportunistic  strategy in  a  fundamental underlying  sense  of  society'sutility will,  I think, be very much on the  table  if  we have  toconfront  that particular bill.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I agree  with  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions  for Don?  If not,let me  start  off.  I will  take  a little  more  time  than  usual becausedespite  the  short-term budget  turmoil  and all  sorts  of  churning in  theeconomy, in  concert  with Don's  endeavor to  sketch  out  longer-termpolicy  issues,  I want  to  raise  a broad hypothesis  about  where  theeconomy is  going over  the  longer  term  and what  the  underlying  forcesare.  While  I have  not  seen Don's  set  of  boxes before,  I am  sure  youare  going  to  fit me  in  one box  after another  as  I go  through  this, butI hope you won't  try  to  do  it  too  readily!  [Laughter]You may recall  that earlier  this year  I raised the  issue  ofthe  extraordinary impact  of  accelerating technologies,  largelysilicon-based  technologies,  on  the  turnover of  capital  stock,  thefairly dramatic  decline  in  the  average  age  of  the  stock,  and thecreation as  a consequence  of  a high degree of  insecurity  for  those12/19/95-36-individuals in  the  labor markets  who  have  to  deal  with continuallychanging  technological apparatus.  One  example  that  I  think bringsthis  development close  to home,  even  though  it  is  an unrealisticexample,  is  how  secretaries  would feel  if  the  location of  the  keys  ontheir  typewriters were  changed  every  two years.  We  are  in  effectdoing  that  to  the  overall  workforce.As  I indicated  in my remarks  two  or  three meetings ago,  weare  getting as  a consequence of  this  a very significant  increase  inthe  sense  of  job insecurity and  indeed  the  trade-off between  jobinsecurity and wage  increases.  To my mind, this  increasingly explainswhy wage patterns have been  as  restrained as  they have been.  Oneextraordinary piece  of  recent  evidence  is  an  unprecedented  number oflabor  contracts with  five-  or  six-year maturities.  We never  had alabor  contract  of more  than  three years'  duration  in  the  last  30  to  40years,  though  I am certain  that  somebody can come  up with an  exampleof  some quirk  somewhere  along the  line.  As  far back as  I can recall,the  maturity distribution of  labor  contracts  in  the  BLS  data wasalways  cut  off  at  three years.  The underlying  technology  changes  thatsupport  this  hypothesis really  appear  only once  every century, or  50years,  or something  like  that  as  best  I can judge,  and many of  youhave been giving various  examples  that  support  this  hypothesis,  GaryStern obviously being one.I think the accelerated capital  turnover and the  advancingtechnology are  having,  in  addition  to  the  labor market  effect,  afairly pronounced  impact  on  costs  for  different  reasons.  Basically,the downsizing of  products  as  a consequence  of  computer  chiptechnologies  has  created, as  you  are  all  aware,  a significant declinein  implicit  transportation  costs.  We  are producing very smallproducts  that  are  cheaper  to  move.  They also  are  cheaper  to moveacross  borders,  and so  we  see  them  spreading  around the  world.  Moreimportantly--and this  is  really  a relatively recent phenomenon--is  thedramatic  effect  of  telecommunications  technology in  reducing the  costof  communications.  A while back,  The Economist  had an  article thatwas  called, I think,  "The Death  of  Distance."  They were pointing  out,as  one readily observes,  that  we  are  gaining the  ability  to maketelephone  calls between Washington and London,  for example,  at  thesame  cost  as  between Washington  and Baltimore.  The  reason  is  thatincreasingly as  fiber-optic-related  technologies  and satellitecommunications  evolve,  the  cost  of  adding  200  or 1,000  miles  doesn'tmatter  when you  are going 22,000  miles  up  and 22,000 miles  down.  Thatis  why the  Internet  charges essentially  flat  fees  for all  subscribers,and connections  can be made  anywhere.  The  reason  is  that  distancedoesn't  change the  underlying cost.What  this  has  done  is  to  create  a major  force  for  increasinglabor  specialization because  it  broadens  the  scope  of  what anindividual  or company  can get  involved  in.  We are  raising  the  oldissues  of  comparative advantage  and the  division  of  labor  out  of  theold Economics  I textbooks.  In effect,  as  the  downsized products  havespread and the  cost  of  communications  has  fallen,  the  globe has becomeincreasingly  smaller.  In the  1850s,  a  farm somewhere  in  the Midwestwould have been a  self-sufficient,  fairly  low productivity operationbecause  there was  no  comparative advantage.  What we are  now seeing  isa tremendous move  toward the proliferation  of  outsourcing, not  only  inthe  immediate area  but  ever  increasingly around the  globe.  What  onewould expect  to  see as  this  occurs--and  indeed it  is  happening--is  the12/19/95-37-combination of  rising  capital  efficiency and  falling nominal  unitlabor  costs.  In  fact,  that  is  happening by  every measure  we  can  lookat.One may readily argue  that  this  process  has been  going on  inone  way or  another  since  the  beginning  of  the  Industrial  Revolution,but  I think we are now  seeing an acceleration  of  the  process  largelyas  a consequence  of  the  type of  technological  change  that  isoccurring.  I have been looking at  business  cycles  since  the  late1940s  and have been aware  of  the various  technological  changes;  therewas  just  nothing  like  this  earlier.  This  is  a new phenomenon,  and itraises  interesting questions  as  to  whether  in  fact  there  is  somethingmore profoundly important  going on  in  the  longer run.  We  usuallydismiss  that  sort  of  development  on the  grounds  that  its  effect on  theshort  run is  nominal.  I have a suspicion  that  in  this  period, unlikeprevious periods,  we will  find  that  the  long-run,  deep-seated forcesare  not  so  gradual  as  to be  readily dismissed  in  any  short-termeconomic  evaluation.  I suspect  that  the evidence  is  increasinglyemerging  that  there  is  something different  going on,  which we have  notlooked at  for awhile.One  would certainly assume that  we  would see  this  in  theproductivity data,  but it  is  difficult  to  find  it  there.  In  myjudgment  there  are  several  reasons,  the most  important of  which  isthat  the data are  lousy.  I think we have  not  correctly defined how tocapture  the value added  in various  industries, as  I believe  I havepointed out  previously.  Looking at  market  values, we  are  notcapitalizing various  types  of  activities properly.  In  the past, welooked  at  capital  expenditures  only as  spending on  a blast  furnace  ora steel  rolling mill.  Now, improvement  in  the  value  of  a  firm  isinfluenced by such  factors  as  how much  in-house  training  they have andwhat  type.  That  creates  economic  value  in  the  stock-market  sense,  andwe  are  not measuring  it  properly.Secondly, I suspect  that we  also may well  be  looking at  thelag  that  Professor Paul  David of  Stanford has  been talking  about.  Itrelates  to  the question of  why computer  technology is  not  creating theproductivity that we would expect  to  observe  by looking at  individualcompanies.  The  reason  is  largely  that  the  global infrastructure  hasnot yet adjusted.  In  a similar manner, we had  electric motors  cominginto use  in the  late  part  of  the  19th  century, but  they were put  intoa system whose infrastructure was built on minimizing costs  for  steamengines.  The technology of  a steam-engine  economy is  fundamentallydifferent  from that  of  an  electric-motor  economy.  It  wasn't  until  theconstruction of  horizontal  types  of  factory buildings  in  the  1920sthat  our manufacturing  firms  finally were able to  take  advantage ofthe  synergies  implicit  in  the  electric  dynamo  and achieve  fairlydramatic  increases  in  productivity.  This  showed up and  correlatedfairly directly with trends  in  unit motor use  and secondary uses  ofelectric motors,  which  I thought  Professor  David did a remarkablythorough job  in  evaluating.While  the analogies  are not  exact,  there  is  somethingextraordinarily obvious  as we  read  through what  he  is  saying andobserve  what  is  going on  now.  Firms  are putting tremendous  effortsinto  computer technology.  A  lot  of  it  is  wasted, as  inevitably itmust be,  and we  still  have  not  restructured vast parts  of  the way wedo business  to  fit  a  fundamentally new  technology.  It  is  going  to12/19/95-38-take  a long while  to  do  that.  It  is  unclear exactly how that  fitsinto  our policy process.  But  I think  it  is  important  to  put  thispoint  on  the  table,  and  I present  this  as  a hypothesis  since  it  issomething that  we will  not  be  sure  is  the appropriate  assessment  ofour  changing world for probably  five  to  ten years.  But  the  point  thatDon Kohn  has  been  raising and we  have  just  been discussing  is  verycritical  to what  we  are  doing.Let me  suggest  to  you what  the  recent  short-term evidenceappears  to  be  that  is  consistent with  this  hypothesis.  Ultimately,when we have  a hypothesis, the  facts  either  fit  it  or they  don't.  Thewage pattern that  I mentioned  is  clearly consistent with  it.  It  alsohas  been mentioned here,  I think  quite importantly, that  breaking  theback of  the  inflationary surge  last year  and early this  year was  a loteasier  in  retrospect  than  it  should have been.  You may recall  thatthe markets  had federal  funds  rates projected  to  the moon  a year ago.The  reason  they did is  not because  they were not  thoughtful.  Thereason  is  that previous  relationships  implicitly called  forsubstantial  increases  in  the  federal  funds rate  to  restrain andcontain  the burgeoning  inflationary pressures  that  we  were  looking at.As  has  been mentioned many  times,  the  CPI  is  currentlyrunning  under expectations  or  forecasts.  My suspicion  is--and this  isa benevolent  outlook in  Don's  context--that  we  are going  to  find thatthe  inflation rate will  continue  to  come  in below expectations.  Ithink this  process  is  not  about  to  come  to  an  immediate  end, althoughI will  suggest  in  a minute  why it  is  not  a permanent  state  of  theworld that  would allow central  banks  to  pack up  and go home.  I foundthe  charts  on  long-term inflation  expectations  in  the Greenbook, PartII,  really quite  startling  because  they  suddenly dip  fairly  sharplywith  the  emergence  of  a general  awareness  that  we  are  in a  late  stageof  a business  cycle  period that  has  not  created the  inflationaryproblems  that  previously have  occurred in  the post-World War  IIperiod.The  sharp decline  in  long-term yields has  struck me  as  quiteextraordinary.  I know of  no  one who  forecast  that  with any degree  ofconfidence.  Despite  the Treasury, we  are getting  issues  of  100-yearbonds,  and that  occurs  only  infrequently.  The  last  time  it  happenedwas  in  1993.  Before  that,  I think it  was  the  turn  of  the century.That  in effect  is  saying  that  there are  people out  there who arewilling to  take  low yields  for  100 years.  The  fact  that  someborrowers  are  issuing  these bonds  is  terrific.  Until  you get  somebodydumb enough to  buy  them,  that  is  terrific.  But  the point  is  that  theyare  selling, although  they may not  sell  in  the  future because  of  thenew  tax  concerns.Finally,  it  is  very difficult  to  find typical  inflationaryforces  anywhere  in  the world.  If  this phenomenon  is  correct,  it  hasto  be worldwide.  What we  are  observing  is  1 to  2 percent  inflation inEurope,  and none  to  speak of  in  some  areas where  inflation reallyshould be  at  a high level.  What  has  surprised me most of  all veryrecently is  that  the  CPI  inflation  rate  in Argentina was  1.7  percentfor  the  last  12  months, and  that was  not per month.  Even  the  outsideinflationary processes  are being  contained.  Something different  isgoing on.  I don't  deny, as  has been argued here,  that  central  bankshave  been a  factor  in  this.  I suggest  to  you that  we  are  probablynecessary conditions  for  this  state of  affairs  to  persist.  But  I12/19/95would suspect  that  if  we  did not  have  these  technological  changesgoing on,  our job  and  that  of  our  counterparts  abroad would  have  beenmaterially more  difficult.I certainly can  agree  that my hypothesis  is  the  statisticalequivalent  of  a falling NAIRU.  That's  all  fine  and good, but  merelysaying that  the  NAIRU has  fallen, which  is  what  we  tend  to  do,  is  notvery helpful.  That's  because whenever we  miss  the  inflation  forecast,we  say the  NAIRU  fell.  We  have  to  understand what  it  is  that  iscausing this.  I am always  uncomfortable with  a national NAIRU numberbecause  I always  look  at  local  NAIRUs.  I do  not  think there  is  thesame  slope  on  inflationary expectations  across  local  areas.  I am alittle  dubious  of  the  national number,  but  I would grant  that  there  isa fairly impressive  statistical  relationship between  inflation  and thenational NAIRU.  What  I am  saying is  that  if  this  hypothesis  iscorrect, we are  looking at  a  significantly different  set  of  inflationpressures  in  the world economy.  I keep  mentioning the word  "if"because  it  is  a hypothesis.  It  is  one  that  I have been  thinking  aboutfor  over a year.  The  evidence continues  to  come  in  and suggest  thatthere  is  something going on here.  If  it  is  true,  then  clearly we  canreach price stability with real  interest  rates  lower  than where  theyare  now.  I do not  know where  this hypothesis  fits  in Don's  chart,  butit  is  in  the most  benevolent  square.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  The  positive supply shock  square  in  Don'schart.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  the positive  supply  shock  square.However, before  I go  too  far,  let  me  repeat  what  I said when  I firstraised this  issue  about worker  insecurity and  wages.  If  at  a fixeddegree  of  job  insecurity there  is  an  associated rise  in  real wages,then  at  a higher  level  of  job  insecurity we would get  the  same  trendat  a  lower  level  of  real  wages.  What  I think  is  happening to  us  nowis  that we  are  going from  this  higher  level  of  insecurity and  tiltingdown  into a  lower  level.  The  transition period, by definition,temporarily creates  a much slower rate  of  change, but  ultimately weget back  to  a new  level with  a rising trend.  The  same  thing  occurswhen we  look  at  capital  efficiency  or  this  type  of  hypothesis.  It  isa transitional  issue,  and it  is  not  one  that  puts  us  in  a permanentstate  of noninflation.  What  we  do not  know  is  where  the  fulcrum  ofthis  process  is,  whether  it  is  out  there six months  or  six years.  ThePaul  David argument would say that  it  is  out  there  six years.  I don'tfeel  that confident  about  it,  but  clearly  this  article, whichincidentally was  written  in 1989,  has  turned out  to  be  extraordinarilyprescient as  to what  has  occurred.Getting down  to  the mundane  question of  where  that  leaves  usfor  policy  today,  as  a number  of  you have maintained, fallinginflation expectations  have  increased  the real  funds  rate  since  July.Indeed,  there  is  a question  as  to  whether  in  fact  the  rate  is  highernow in  real  terms  than  it  was when the nominal  rate was  at  6 percent.It  is  a close  call  as  to whether  it  is  higher,  but  it  is  not  somethingthat  one  readily rules  out.  I know  there  is  a  sense of  strengthimplicit  in  the  Greenbook.  I have  difficulty with it.  To me,  theeconomy has more of  a  feel  of driving with  the  parking brake partiallyengaged.  One  gets  the  sense  that  the  economy  is  not  breaking out  as  Ithought  it  might  last  summer.  That  suggests  to me  that  the upsidepotential  in  this  economy is  limited.  I come  to  the conclusion, which12/19/95-40-should not  come  as  a surprise,  that  we  rightfully  should be moving  thefunds  rate  lower.What  are  the  risks?  I am not worried  about product  priceinflation if  for no  other  reason  than  I think  that  the  longer  term  ishelpful.  But  I am a little  concerned  that  the  behavior  of  inventorieshas  not been as  benevolent  as  I would have  expected.  I agree withMike  Prell;  I do  not  think  that  one  can  readily  see  real  overhangsexcept  in  motor vehicles.  But  we  are not  down to  the  slimmed pacethat  I felt we might have  reached by now, and it  is  making me a  littleuncomfortable.  So,  I am not  concerned about moving  lower  in  thecontext  of  worrying about  reigniting product  inflationary forces.  Ithink the probability of  that  is  very  low and  frankly 25  basis pointsis  not  in  that  regard  a big  deal.  The  real  danger  is  that we  are atthe  edge of  a bond and stock bubble.  Yesterday's market  clearlyhelped, but  it  is  not  going to  last very  long.  The  sharp runup  instock prices  is  very heavily determined by the  climb  in  long-term bondprices, but not  fully.  There has  been  some not  insignificant  declinein  real  equity premiums,  and even though we  are  still well above  thedangerous  levels  of  October  1987  prior  to  the  stock market  crash, weare  in  the  lower  ranges  so  to  speak.  It  would not  take  terribly muchto  drive  us  through.  That  is  the  reason why, if  we  are  perceived tobe  easing policy, it  is  conceivable  that we  could  foster  furtherproblems  in  that  regard.  Fortunately, I think we may be  close  to  atleast  some  temporary peak in  stock prices  if  for  no  other  reason  thanthat  markets do not  go  straight  up  indefinitely, and  the Dow JonesIndustrial  average has  been going literally straight  up.I have no  problem with moving down now  knowing that,  if  theeconomy picks up,  we  have a quite  significant  amount  of  time  to  moveback  up  again  and to  tighten to  whatever extent  we  think  might berequired.  I think nonetheless  that we  have  to  be  a  little  carefulabout being  too aggressive.  I would  be uncomfortable  with  50  basispoints  unless  I knew  for  certain that  the hypothesis  that  I have  laidout here  today were  really  true.  In fact,  if  somebody guaranteed itto  me,  I think we  could  safely go  down  100  basis  points.I would go  25  basis  points  now with no  change  in  the  discountrate.  It  is  conceivable  that we  may have  to  go  lower.  I do not  thinkthat we have  to  make  that  judgment,  and  indeed it  is  not  a judgmentthat  I think it  is  appropriate for us  to  make  at  this  time.  Thereason that  moving down more  than 25  basis points would be  a big  dealis  that  we would then  raise  the  discount rate  question.  I think thatrequires  a great deal  more  confidence  that  inflation is  contained.  Iwould go  symmetrical  if  we  move down 25  basis points.  I wouldrecommend  that  the  action be  accompanied by a statement  thatemphasized that  the  reason  for  the action would largely be  thebehavior  of  inflation.  For  example  if  we were  to  do  it,  I wouldrecommend  that  the operative paragraph  of  our press  statement  saysomething  like:  "Inflation has  been  somewhat more  favorable  thananticipated since  the  last  easing  of  monetary policy in  July, and  thisresult  along with an associated moderation  in  inflation expectationswarrants  a modest  easing  in monetary conditions."I would eschew two  issues  in  the press  release.  One,  I wouldnot  say anything  that  has  to  do with  the economy because  I do notthink  the  economy is  what  is  relevant here.  I may not  feel  asstrongly positive  about  the  economic outlook  as  the Greenbook, but12/19/95-41-there  is  no  real  evidence  here  of  cumulative deterioration.  I thinkthis  is  basically  a long-term  inflation  adjustment process  in which weare  trying to  set  the  real  funds  rate at  the  point where  we  can  movetoward price  stability in  a coherent way.  Secondly, I would not  liketo  see  the word  "budget" mentioned  in  the release  because  there  hasbeen much  too  much said about  our basically rewarding good budgetactions  and penalizing bad budget  actions.  We  are  not  in  thatbusiness  nor  can we  nor should we be  in  such  a business.  Nonstatementof  any budget  considerations  will,  I think,  speak more  loudly thananything we  could say.  In  any event,  I have  run out  of  things  todiscuss,  and that  is  my recommendation at  the  moment.  I call  onPresident Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I think you have  laid  out an  extraordinarilyintriguing  and interesting scenario.  When preparing  for  this meetingand looking  at  the  forces  in  the  economy, our use of  a  traditionalKeynesian  framework  to  evaluate  the Greenbook  forecast  led us  to  agreewith  that  forecast--the patterns  of  good  solid growth,  stableinflation  rates,  low unemployment  and so  forth--and we  saw the risksto  that  forecast  as  being relatively balanced.  However, when onebegins  to  think  about  the  changing framework--that  is,  the  NAIRU beinglower,  using that  as  convenient  terminology, or the  economy'spotential being higher  and perhaps  providing a  little more  room  forgrowth without higher  inflation if  that  new environment  hasmaterialized--then it  is  quite  tempting  to  think  of  the  current  levelof  real  interest  rates  as  too  high  to  promote  the projected  levels  ofgrowth.  The  new framework suggests  some  additional room  to probe  onthe  up  side  or  the  down  side,  however  one  wants  to  look  at  it,  andpossibly  to  get more  growth  out  of  the  economy  at  given  levels  ofinflation  or even  declining rates  of  inflation.  I would  like  tobelieve  that  such  a new world  is  here  and that  there  is  some  evidence,given  the reactions  of  wages  and so  forth,  that  says  it  is  here.However,  I don't  think  the  evidence  is  strong enough yet  to  be  reallypersuasive.Reflecting on your  comments  about  the potential  bubble  in  thebond and stock markets, Mr. Chairman,  it  is  hard for me  to  believethat  real  interest  rates  are  too  high.  It  is  also  hard  for me  tothink about  easing credit  in  the  face of  the  kinds  of  financialterms  of  the  stock and bond market bubbles  and  in terms  of  capacityconstraints  and so  on  if  the world has not  changed, clearly are muchhigher  if  upside  risks  are  realized as  opposed  to  downside risks.So  my basic  inclination would be not  to  change policy at  thismeeting, but  I can't debate  25  basis  points.  We  talk about  havingpurchased  insurance against  downside risks  in  July.  My attitude  atthis  point would be  not to  change policy in  the  sense  that  thatpurchases  insurance against  upside risks.  All  that  said,  I don'tthink I will  dissent over  25  basis points,  but  I think  there  are riskshere and  the  risks pertain  to whether or  not we have  that  new worldyou described sufficiently  in hand.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  on  the basis of  myearlier  comments, nobody will  be  surprised that  I think your policyrecommendation  is  right,  for  the  right reasons,  and in  the  right12/19/95-42-amount.  I don't think  we  should expect  the market  to  be particularlypleased with  our  action.  There  is  a  fair  likelihood  that  the marketcorrection  in both stocks  and bonds  will  continue,  partially becauseeven  though the  market  is  erratic,  some  will  think our  move  is  not asbig  as  they would  like  it  to  be.  But  more  importantly, we  are  nearthe year-end,  the  markets  are  relatively thin,  and people  have  somevery large  gains  that  they may well  decide  to  realize  so  that  1995will  look  like  a good  year  for  them.  We might  also have  someadditional  stock  selling shortly after  the  turn  of  the year.  Theredoes  seem  to be  a fair  number  of  investors who have  held off  sellingstocks,  or  selling bonds  for that  matter, in  the  hope  that  the  capitalgains  tax will  be  lower  effective January 1,  1996.  How much  of  thatsentiment  there  is,  nobody  knows,  but  I believe  that  there  is  some.In my view, it  is  very important  that  we not do more than  25  basispoints  and that we  not touch  the discount  rate because  there  issufficient uncertainty that,  even though  I happen  to  agree  that  yourhypothesis  is  likely  to  turn  out  to be  right,  I think we shouldproceed cautiously.  While  I am very much a member  of  theopportunistic  school  for  achieving price  stability, I am a near-fanatic  believer  in achieving price  stability.  I think  that  the  25basis point move  leaves  our price  stability drive very much  intact.

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am  one  of  thoseopportunists  who  think  that  we have  the  real  funds  rate  too high.  Asyou said,  it's  higher  than  it  was  at  the peak of  our  tightening.  Idon't  see a reason  to  keep  it  there.  I hope you will  allow me  toagree  with  the  reasons  that  you gave  for  lowering the  rate withoutsigning  on  to your brave new world scenario,  which  I am  not quiteready to  do.  I do  agree  100  percent with  all  your reasons--the  levelof  real  interest  rates,  a weaker  forecast  than  that  in  the Greenbook,and  the minimal  inflationary dangers.  I definitely want  to underscorethat  we  are quite  fortunate to  be  sitting  here on December  19--ironically, we  are  quite  fortunate,  but  the  country  is  not--able  totake  this  action and disassociate  it  entirely from  the  budgetnegotiation process,  which I think  is  a very good  thing  for  theFederal  Reserve.  Do  it  now.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  Not  surprisingly I would preferalternative B because  I think we  have  the  opportunity  to moveinflation and  inflation expectations  lower  in  the context  of  aneconomy  that  is  continuing  to  expand generally  in  line  with  the  10-year moving  average.  I also  feel  very  strongly that  3 percentinflation expectations  are  too  high.  On  the  other hand,  I can acceptsome  easing of  restraint.  My  quibble  is  really  with its  timing  andnot  so  much with the  direction  in which we are  moving.  I  think thestance  of  policy will  still be  somewhat  restrictive with  a 25  basispoint reduction,  and such  a reduction could well  be  consistent withlower  inflation.  I think the  risk,  and you put  your  finger on  this,12/19/95-43-has  to  do with how  our actions  are perceived.  People could well  askwhether we  are  committed to  long-term price  stability or preoccupiedwith  short-term considerations  relating  to  the  real  economy.  Thestatement you read  that would accompany  this  action  is  verysignificant  in  terms  of  not mentioning  the  real  economy.  In  fact,  Ihad  a comment  on  the  minutes  for  the  November meeting  that  I passed onto  Don and Norm;  we  had almost  two  pages  of  draft  text  with respect  tothe policy decision  last  time  before  inflation was mentioned.  So,  nomatter what we  say  in  that  statement,  for  a lot  of  reasons  theperception is  out  there and will  be out  there  that we  are  moving  inpart  in  response  to  concerns  about  the  real  economy.  I would  stronglyobject  to  any move  greater  than 25  basis  points  now or  one  thatinvolved a cut  in  the  discount  rate  for  the  reasons you  cited.  Iagree  that  an advantage  of  moving now, though not  a reason,  is  toemphasize  the  absence  of  any  short-run  linkage  between monetary policyand fiscal  policy negotiations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I won't  say anything about  thebudget, but I might  just mention  the  economy  in  passing.  I think yourlonger-term vision  of  what  I would  describe as  a permanent  or  at  leastpersistent positive supply  shock is  an appealing hypothesis and maywell  be  a valid one.  But  in  talking  about  today's policy  decision, Iam  taking a little  shorter-run point  of view.  Clearly,  one can make  acase  for  some easing  this  morning;  I don't  deny  that.  But  on  thebottom  line,  I would come  out with Cathy and Tom, as  I am  sure willnot  be  surprising.  There  are  risks  in  taking  this  action now.  Thereis  a risk  that we may  send a message,  at  least  to  some people,  that wethink  the  economy still  has  a good bit  of  room  to  run  even  though wehad a very strong  third  quarter, and we  may well  find that  we have  arelatively strong  fourth  quarter when  the  figures  come  out.  I  feelthere  is  a risk  that  they could undermine  our  credibility at  a timewhen we may well  be  on  the verge  of  a breakthrough  in  our  quest  forprice  stability.  I mentioned  in my economic  statement  that  I thinkthe  current  situation and  the very short-term outlook  are unusuallyuncertain.  I know  one  can always make  the  case,  and  sometimes  it'smade  too  frequently, to  wait  until  the  next number  or  the  next  batchof  data,  but  to  me  that  argument  seems more  compelling in  thissituation  than normally.  Against  that  background,  I think  our bestmove  today is  no move.  The economy's  strength in  the  third quarter,the  likely possibility that  we  will get  another  strong quarter  in  thecurrent  quarter, and the  economy's proximity to  something  likepotential  GDP  all  argue  to me  that  it's  better  to  wait  at  this point.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Having  dissented infavor  of  ease  last  time,  I am reminded of  Governor Blinder'sbasketball  coach.  I certainly support  your  recommendation.  I alsosupport your view that  there  should be  no mention  of  fiscal policy inour statement,  but  I do  think  that  in  fact  there  will be  some  linkagemade and in  this  case an unfortunate  one.  We would have been muchbetter  off  to  have  moved in November.  Also, I don't  think we  shouldpretend that  we in  fact  ignore  fiscal  policy in  our actions.  To do  sowould be  silly.  The  government  is  one-third of  the  economy.  For usto  ignore  the  actions  of  one-third of  the  economy, well,  we  don't  dothat.  If  there  were a  10  percent  cut  in  government  spending or  a 1012/19/95-44-percent  tax  increase, would  any of  us  say  that  we  should  hold thenominal  fed  funds  rate  the  same?  That  is  just preposterous.  I don'tthink that  was  what  is  implied;  we  certainly pay attention  to  fiscalpolicy.  I would  give  those  two  cases  as  examples  of  demand  shockswhere we  clearly should respond.  There  is  also  a question aboutgovernment  causing  a supply shock.  For  example,  if  the  governmentwere  to  raise  the minimum wage  to  $10  an hour,  that would be  anadverse  supply shock.  If  I followed Don's  outline,  trying  to  besymmetric  in  following your  logic,  we  would respond  to  that  with a  cutin  interest rates.  It's  an  adverse  supply shock.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I don't  think the  Committee  would want  to  cutrates  in  that  case.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  No,  a rise  in  rates.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  A  rise in  interest  rates,  yes.  So,  we  shouldmake  ourselves  even more miserable!  I think this  sort  of  analysistends  to  break  down,  and  that's  why I have problems  with  thedifference between a demand  shock and a  supply shock.  Basically, whenit  comes  to  government  actions  on  the  supply side,  I really don'tthink that  we  should get  in  the way.  I think  that's particularlyapplicable  to  what  I am  afraid may be  the response next  year to  ouraction  today.  There was  a major bond market rally  this  year in  largepart  because  of  an expectation  that  the  out-year  federal  deficits weregoing to  be  reduced  substantially.  If  those  reductions  do not  come  topass,  and according to  reports  yesterday's  stock and bond marketcorrections were  in  large part  linked  to  the  first  realization  on WallStreet  that  such  reductions may not materialize, we  may have  a backupin  intermediate  and long  rates.  If  that  were  to  happen,  I would viewthat  as  an  adverse  supply  shock.  Government  is  doing  something stupidand the markets  know it.  Therefore,  there  is  less  confidencereflected  in  the price  at which  the markets are  willing  to  lend  to  thegovernment.  If  that were  to  occur,  I don't  think  there  is  a lot  wecould do  to  undo  it.  So,  I will  look  forward between  this meeting  andthe  next meeting  to  see  what  happens  on  the  intermediate-  and  long-term portions  of  the  yield  curve.  If  in  fact we get  a backup,  I thinkit  is  going  to be  very difficult  to  make any further  easing moves.Thank you.

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  First of  all,  Don, letme  say that  I appreciate your effort here  in  looking  at  opportunisticversus  deliberate strategies.  I found  this very helpful.  Iunderstand better what  I meant!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I'm glad you  do,  Gary!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Maybe  I'm  the only  one.  Just  to  talk a minuteabout  that,  I do  think  the opportunistic  approach  is  the one  we oughtto  follow.  I say  that  because  as  I understand  the  evidence  and giventhe  quality of  the  evidence, and both may be  flawed--that  is,  myunderstanding and the  evidence  [Laughter]--it  doesn't  suggest  thatthere  are big  gains  in  taking inflation  from  3 percent  to  1 percent  orsomething  like  that.  If  that's  true,  we  should not  want  to pay a verybig  cost  to  do  that.  I think  that  comes  out  in  favor  of  anopportunistic  approach.  Having  said  that,  it  may  surprise you  to12/19/95learn  that  I favor no  change  in policy  at  this meeting.  As  Icommented earlier, while  I believe  that  we may get  a soggy quarter  ortwo  because of  the  inventory  situation,  there  is  nothing at  the momentwe  are  going  to  do  about  that with a policy change.  As  I look  outfurther  into  1996  and 1997,  I am hard pressed  to  see  cumulativeweakness  in  the  economy.  I am hard pressed to  see  a significantproblem that  I can  identify.  Yes,  there  can always  be  shocks;  yes,  Irecognize  that  there  are  risks,  but  I think  there  is  a goodpossibility  that  something  like  the Greenbook  forecast will  berealized.  Maybe  real  short-term interest  rates  are  on  the high side.but  I guess  I am not  entirely persuaded  of  that.  Even  if  they  are,perhaps  that will  reveal  itself  in  lower  inflation rather  thananything  else.  So,  at  this  juncture,  I would  favor  "no change."

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I really  appreciated yourdiscussion of  longer-term  trends.  You discussed  some  of  them in  yourtalk when you were  out  in Chicago,  and I think  that  has  been veryhelpful.  My preference  actually  is  to  wait  at  this meeting and not  tomove  today.  To quote  Mike  Prell,  growth  is  not  steady and we had  avery strong  third quarter  and it  could be  that  the sogginess  we  see  inthe  economy now is  just  some  slowing down  from  that  quarter.  I don'tsee  any urgency to  move  today as  opposed to  the next meeting, and  Ithink  the 25  basis  points  symbolically is  extremely important,  eventhough  it's  not  50  basis points.  I should add, however,  that  I don'tfeel  strongly enough to  dissent.  I think, as  Larry Lindsey said,  thatthere will  be  some  linkage  to  the budget discussions  that  are  going onnow, although  that  was  not  even mentioned  in  any of  our discussionearlier  today.  I agree  that  it  is  very important  in  the press  releaseyou are  suggesting to  relate  our  action  to  receding  inflation  andchange  the discount  rate.  I agree with  the  symmetric  languageproposal  as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I don't  believe  that a  rising realfunds  rate  is  warranted at  this  time.  Also,  our  nominal  incometargeting rule  that we  follow calls  for  a cut  in  the funds  rate ofabout  25  basis  points.  Therefore, I  favor your recommendation  andalso  the  symmetric  language you proposed.  At  least  in terms  of  thework that  my staff  has  done,  it  is  quite possible  that we  may have  toreverse  that  reduction sometime  in  1996  if  we maintain  our longer-termprice  stability objective.  As  I think  I indicated in  July,  clearly amove down at  this  time  should be accompanied by  the recognition  thatit may have  to  be  followed by a move  in  the other direction at  somelater  time.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I can support  your recommendation  for  a smalleasing move, but  I don't  think  that  the  case is  very  strong;  we  couldwait.  The  economy is  growing;  the  stock market  is  strong;  the  WallStreet Journal  says we  are  off  the hook;  and the  shrimp  index  is  up!But we are  behind  the  yield curve,  perhaps  by 50  to  75  basis points.We  are getting  mixed reports  on demand, which  to  me  reduces  the  chanceof  an upside  breakout.  I think  the range  of  potential  outcomes on  the12/19/95-46-fiscal  situation has  narrowed, and  I agree  that  we  should  not beholding back until  there  is  a resolution.  In  fact,  a move  today wouldclarify  that we  are  in  fact  taking  into  account  the overall  economicsituation  and not  tying  ourselves  or  being  tied by a particular  budgetsituation.  To  me  the  crucial  thing  is  the  inflation  experience.  Itis  much improved.  I think  there  is  a good chance,  that  inflation maynot pick up,  at  least  in  the  near  term,  given  the  slackening growth  indemand, the  increases  in  capacity,  the  international competitivepressures,  and the  labor market  flexibility that  we  have  talked about.there  is  much  reason  to  wait.  If  we  go  ahead and move  today,  then  Iwould think that  a symmetric directive  is  appropriate.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I certainly support yourrecommendation.  As  I said earlier,  I see  no  strong pressures  for  achange  in monetary policy at  this  moment  one way or  the  other,  andunder those  conditions my normal  instinct would be  to not move.  Ithink the  risks  are  symmetric and relatively small  at  this  point.  Butof  course we  know policy does  work with  a lag  and as  this  expansioncontinues  to  mature,  I think  the  risks  are more  likely to  turn  to  thedown side  as  time  goes  along.  As  a consequence,  I can support  25basis  points  as  a useful  and modest move.  I certainly concur with  thespirit  of  your proposed statement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Mr. Chairman,  I support your proposal.  I thinkwe have  good  reasons  to  feel  pleased with  the performance  of  theeconomy  over  the  last  18  months.  Our  job now, as  I perceive  it,  issimply to  enable  these  favorable  trends  to  continue.  For  the  reasonsthat  I have  already enumerated,  I think  the  current  level  of  the realfunds  rate  is  on  the high  side.  It  is  arguably higher now than  it  waslast February--as  you mentioned, Mr.  Chairman--given the  decline  ininflationary expectations.  I think  this  poses  a danger  to  theoutlook, not  in  the  short  run, not over  1996,  but over  the  longer  termeven though  I recognize that  that  is  a difficult  call  about whichreasonable people  can disagree.  Nevertheless, having made  that  call  Ithink  that monetary policy should be  forward-looking when we  arelowering interest  rates  just  as  we  are when raising them.  On  thefiscal policy  linkage  issue,  it  seems  to me  that  acting  today ratherthan waiting  for a budget deal  to  be  completed will  enable us  tomitigate  at  least  to  some  extent  the  unfortunate public perception  ofa Fed  that plays  budget politics by holding out  rewards  andpunishments related to progress  on  the  negotiations.  Although havingsaid that,  I certainly agree with what Governor Lindsey  said.  Fiscalpolicy matters  to  the  economy and,  of  course,  we  cannot  ignore  fiscalpolicy linkages  in deciding on  our  own policies.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I agree with  the proposal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I would prefer  that  we not changethe  funds  rate  right  now given the projections  of  our  economists  in12/19/95-47-Kansas City and  in  the  Greenbook.  However,  given that  we  are  talkingabout  a small  adjustment  and given that  there would be  theexpectation, which  I would  fully  endorse,  of  no  discount  rate  change,I can  accept your proposal  at  this  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President-elect  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  As my earlier  comments  suggested, I preferalternative A.  I think 25  basis points  and a  symmetrical  directiveare  the  right  construct.  I don't  think  I can  add to  the argumentsthat  already have been made and will  spare you a  repetition of  thosearguments.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Mr. Chairman,  I think  that  over  time  the  evidencewill  accumulate  that  your hypothesis  is  correct.  I am concerned  thatthat  evidence will  accumulate very slowly,  judged  in  terms  of  beingpersuasive  to  everybody within  the  System and to  others who need tothink about  these  things.  The  slow but  eventual  acceptance of  theevidence and  the hypothesis means  that  policy ultimately, ex post,will be viewed  as  having  been too  tight  for  the  evolving conditions.I support  the  move  today, but  I think we  need to  be prepared to  be  alittle more  aggressive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  It's  in  times  like  this  that  we wish we hadmeasures  of  the  money supply  and reserves  that would  accuratelyreflect  the  stance  of monetary policy.  I think  if  we did,  it  wouldclearly  show that  there  has been a tightening of  policy.  But  we  don'thave  those measures,  and we  are  stuck with the  federal  funds  rate.There  is  a long history around this  table  of using  and abusing afederal  funds  rate  target.  I think what we  are  doing  today  is  theright  thing  in  terms  of  using  the  fed  funds  rate and makingdiscretionary  adjustments when it  is  necessary  to  avoid  the peggingproblem that  we have had  so  often  in  the past.  So,  I think what weare doing here  is  the  right  thing.  This  is  not  the  time  to betightening policy.  Your  admonition about  referring  to  the budget  iswell  taken.  I must  say, as  others  have  said,  that  I have  beenincreasingly uncomfortable  in  recent months  about  the perception  thatthere is  a tight  link between what we  do  in  the Fed and what happenson  the  fiscal policy  front.  I  think it's  important that  that  link bebroken.  I also  agree with you  that  this  ought  to  be a cautious move.There is  enough uncertainty about  the  economy.  I think  the assetinflation problem, the bubble  effect,  is  one  that we  ought  to  takeinto  account.  Our announcement ought  to  be  couched  in  terms of  areduction  in  inflationary expectations.  I agree  that  our actionshould be a 25  basis point  reduction  in  the  federal  funds  rate with  asymmetrical  directive and no  discount  rate  change.On  the  issue of  opportunistic versus  deliberative,  I think  itshould always be  clear  in  this  discussion that whether  one  takes  theopportunistic road  or the  deliberative  road, the  commitment  toachieving price  stability is  absolutely firm.  I don't  think there  isany  difference in  the commitment between  those  who  adhere  to  oneprocess  or  another.  We need to be  clear  about  that.  My own view isthat  the  opportunistic  approach is  the  preferred  one mainly because  it12/19/95-48-works.  There  is  a practical  history to  it,  and I think  that  there  isa practical  future  to  it.  While  we  are  independent,  what  we  do  has  tomake  sense  to  the  country  as  a whole.  I think  the  opportunisticapproach will  get  us  to  price  stability, and I  think  it  will  be  a moreacceptable  approach broadly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  There  is  a consensus  for  a25  basis point decline  in  the  funds  rate  and a symmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The  wording of  the  operational  paragraph is  onimmediate future,  the  Committee seeks  to  decrease  slightly theexisting degree  of pressure  on reserve  positions.  In  the  context  ofthe Committee's  long-run objectives  for price  stability andsustainable economic  growth, and giving  careful  consideration toeconomic,  financial,  and monetary developments,  slightly greaterreserve restraint  or  slightly  lesser reserve  restraint would beacceptable  in  the  intermeeting period.  The  contemplated reserveconditions  are  expected to  be  consistent with moderate  growth  in M2and M3  over coming months."
