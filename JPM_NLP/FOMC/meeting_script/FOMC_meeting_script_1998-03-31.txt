CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Welcome,  everybody.  I especially  want to  welcomeback an  old  colleague,  Bill Poole.  I did  not realize  that the  last  time  he sat  in  this  room was  25years ago.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I was sitting back there  along the wall.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It  has taken  25  years  to move from  there to here?

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Baby steps.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Well,  that's  the  pleasant  news.  The  less pleasant  newsis that  both Joe  Coyne  and Larry Promisel,  who have been  fixtures  in  this room  and  around  herefor a very long  time, probably  are attending  their  last  meeting.The agenda  is fairly routine  today,  as you well  know,  and  I would like to  start  off byrequesting  approval  of the  minutes  for the  meeting of February  3-4,  1998.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So moved.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  You  all  have received  a Report ofExamination  of the System Open  Market  Account.  Are  there any  questions on  that?  If not,would  somebody  like to move  acceptance?

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Peter Fisher, please.

MR.  FISHER.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  I  will  be  referring to  apackage  of materials  that you should have  in  front of you.  It begins  with aone-page  summary of my comments.  1/1/ Copies  of the materials  used by  Mr. Fisher are  appended  to the transcript.  (Appendix  1)3/31/98Going  over the  summary, the  first point is that  the  short-term  andforward  interest  rate  curves for the G-3  countries  remain  relatively flat.Second,  I  will  be commenting  that  greed eclipses  fear  in  asset markets,except in  Japan.  My third point  will  be that  the flat forward  pricing  ofshort-term  interest  rates  reflects,  in  my view,  a  "clearing  price"  fordivergent  views  about  the direction  of the Committee's  next  move, not  aconviction  about  the  likelihood of steady  policy.  If I  am  right about that,then  there is  something of a  problem.  Why  hasn't the risk premiumassociated  with  this uncertainty  been  more  evident  in  the Treasury  yieldcurve?  I  offer two tentative  answers  to that.  One is that,  in general,expanding  risk  appetites  have  consumed  the uncertainty  for the moment.Secondly  and more  technically,  reductions  in  Treasury  supply both  actualand  anticipated,  combined  with  the flat forward  money  market  curverecently  have  been  encouraging  dealers  to extend  duration,  and that  hastended  to  flatten  the  Treasury  yield  curve.  Finally,  I  will  discuss  Deskpreparations  for the  heavy tax inflows  in  April  and May  that  will  cause  asharp rise  in the Treasury  balance  and  lead once  again  to  a need for muchlarger  operations  than  normal.Turning  to the  charts  on  page  2  that show  current,  3-month  forward,and 9-month  forward  deposit  rates,  you  can  see  that these  rates  remainrelatively  flat in  all  three  charts.  Only in  Germany,  the  blue  lines,  is  theremuch  of a  spread  between  the current  3-month  rate  and  the  9-month  forward3-month  rate.  In  the chart for the  United States,  the  red  lines,  you  will notesee that forward  rate expectations  backed  up  following the  Chairman'sHumphrey-Hawkins  testimony, but  they have  not backed  up to  the  levelswhere  they  closed  at  the  end of last  year.Looking  at the  chart  for German  rates,  you  can  see that there  continuesto be a wide  spread  between  current  and  forward  rates  relative  to thespreads  for Japan  and  the  United States.  That  spread  reflects theanticipation  that the  European  Central  Bank,  when  it comes  into existencenext January,  probably  will  have a  policy  rate  somewhere  in  the mid  3percent  range;  3-1/2  percent  is what  most people  in the market  expect.  TheBundesbank's  current  rate is  3.3 percent.  Even  with  that  in the background,I think the German  economy  and  the European  economies  more  generallyare  perceived  to be  doing  a bit better than  they  were earlier,  and it  isnoteworthy  that both  Finland and  Norway  raised  their rates.  So,  if anything,the  market has  a  sense of some upside  risk  to interest  rates  in Europe,  evenif the potential  increase  is very moderate.Finally, in  the bottom  chart  you  can  see  that Japanese  deposit  rates,both current  and forward,  declined in  February  and  March.  This reflectssome  decline  in the Japanese  bank premium.  Unfortunately,  this is  not  somuch  the  result of an  improvement  in the  credit  standing  of the individualinstitutions  but rather, in  my  view,  a  reassertion  of the  convoy  system  and3/31/98the implicit government  guarantee behind  the  major Japanese  banks.  TheJapanese  government  simply will  not  let those  banks fail,  and  that  haspulled  some of the risk  premium  out  of the  forward  rate  market.With that  rather  muted  monetary policy outlook in the  G-3 countries,the charts  on the next page  suggest  in  my  view  how  greed has  eclipsed  fearin  a number  of the  asset  markets.  In our written  report, we  detailed  thatphenomenon  across  a number of individual  markets.  This is a quicksummary.On  the  left  side, we  have  equity indices  re-indexed  to July 1, 1997,  andtotal  return bond  indices  for the United  States,  Germany,  and Japan.  Thered  lines  show  the equity  indices  trading  up from  a 100  value on  July  1 andthe blue lines indicate  the  total return  on  10-year  bond  indices.On  the  right side,  we have  indexed  the  option implied  volatility onequity and  bond futures  in the G-3  countries.  We plotted  the  price of anoption  and its  implied  volatility on  each  of the  contracts, but  they  areindexed  to place them  on  comparable  terms,  again  with  100 on  July 1, 1997.You can  see  that the  upward shifts  in  volatility that  occurred  in  October  andGenerally  speaking,  you can  see  that financial  asset prices  in  the UnitedStates  and  Germany have been  consistently rising  since  the Novemberperiod  and their volatilities  consistently falling,  although  it  is  noteworthythat in  the  last few  days there has  been  some  uptick in the  impliedvolatilities  in  both  the United  States and  Germany.The bottom  panel,  of course,  shows  that Japan  is  quite  a different  story.You can  see the  poor performance  of the Nikkei,  but  it did  rally early  thisyear, and total  returns on  Japanese  government  bonds have  improved.  Theauthorities  were  working quite  hard over the  last quarter to get  the Nikkei  toclose at the  18,000 level,  an  effort  that did not succeed.  On  this index  scale,89  would be equal  to  the  18,000  level.  In Tokyo,  they  even invented  a newterm for this effort.  Traditionally,  the market  has  referred  to PKO,  meaningprice keeping  operations, where  public pension  funds and  the  like  are usedto support  equities.  In the  last  month  or so, they have relabeled  these PLO,price lifting  operations.  As  you can  see,  the Japanese  authorities  had theironly  success  in  early  January, and  since  then  they  have succeeded  only  inlifting the  level  of volatilities, illustrated  on the  right.I did not chart  the last  few  days.  With  the failure  of the Nikkei  to closeat  the  18,000 level  at Japan's fiscal  year-end,  the markets  are quite  anxiousat this point.  The  yen has  been  weakening  a bit, reflecting  something  of asense  in the  markets  that  the Japanese  authorities  are without  a policy  at this3/31/98point.  While we  hear that  one  more package  is  coming,  it  is  not  clear thatthe  package  is going  to do  anything  for the  financial  sector, and the  marketsare  quite cynical  about  what  is likely to happen.The next page  provides  another way of thinking  about  how  riskappetites  have been  expanding.  I  return  to a  table  that I  showed  to theCommittee  last  August  in  which  I  introduced  the different  philosophies  offour  characters  in  their search  of a  return  in financial  markets--the  optimistsand  pessimists  under the  old  paradigm  and the new  paradigm.The top  half of this table  is  identical  in  form  to the  one  that I  presentedto  the  Committee  last  August.  It  shows the  old  paradigm  pessimist  who  isworried  about  an  imminent  breakout  of inflation  and  the  old  paradigmoptimist who thinks  inflation  may  be coming  but the  Fed may be able  todelay it  for a few  quarters.  We  have  the  new  paradigm  optimist  who  thinksthe  economy has entered  a new  era  and  he  does  not  worry  about  inflation  atall.  We have  the new paradigm  pessimist  who  thinks that  deflation  is  uponus.  I  introduced  these four  characters  last August  to help  explain  thevolatility  we were  then  experiencing  in the markets,  including  intradayvolatility,  and  these  four characters  were  duking it out  in  the  markets.  Ireintroduce  them  here to  show briefly  how they would  have  fared  to  date.Had  you  run  a portfolio  consistent  with the  views  of the old  paradigmpessimist,  shorting  stocks  and bonds  as  shown  here  at the bottom,  youwould  have  been  crushed,  to  put it bluntly.  The  new paradigm  pessimist,who would  have been  short  stocks  and  long bonds,  would  have  done  a  littlebetter,  but  his positive  return  in  bonds  would not  have  come  close tooffsetting  his negative  return  in  stocks.The two  optimists would  have  done  fairly well,  obviously.  The  pointis,  of course,  that the  pessimistic  views,  the  skeptical  views,  have  simplybeen  priced out  of this  market  and  are not being reflected  in theperformance  of the  market.  If you were  trying to  manage  money on  thebasis  of those  views,  you were  stopped  out  long  ago.Turning to the  next  page,  I  depict  in the top panel three  differenttrajectories  of the  implied yields  on the fed  funds  futures  contracts.  Theblue  line shows these  yield  trajectories  at  the  time  of the  August  meeting,the green  line  in  early January,  and the red  line  as  of last Friday.  My  view,as  I  mentioned,  is that  the  steady  path of the fed  funds rates  implied  bythese contracts  reflects  a  clearing price  among divergent  views  regardingthe  direction  of the  Committee's  next move.Forgive  me if you saw  it,  but Friday's  Wall  Street  Journal  had  a lovelyitem  in  it that  summarized  a recent poll  of the  36 primary dealers.  Itshowed that  none expects the Fed to change  interest  rates  at this  meeting.3/31/98But the  survey  also revealed  "that there is no  clear consensus  on  thedirection  of the  Fed's next policy  shift."  Sixteen dealers  predicted  atightening,  twelve  an  easing,  seven  saw  the Fed  on  hold for at least  theforeseeable  future,  and one  said it  was not possible to  assess accuratelywhat the Fed will  do.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  With that  degree  of uncertainty, why  isn't theremore  of a risk  premium  evident  in  the yield  curve?  I think,  as I said,  thatexpanding risk  appetites  associated  with  the bull market  in  financial  assetshave  consumed  the premium  and  therefore  partially  obscured  it.  The chartsshowing the bond  and  equity market  returns and  the  implied  volatilitiesspeak for themselves.  Around  the middle  of last week,  both  the impliedvolatilities  on  bonds  and  equities and  the  yield  curve did  begin  to back  up.  Icertainly  would have  been  a buyer of volatility  at  the  low levels reached  inthe middle  of last week.In  my  view,  this backup  in  volatilities and  in  the yield  curve probablyreflects  two things.  One is that  the market  is beginning  to price  in  someuncertainty  in  recognition  of the  greater  uncertainty about  direction.Secondly,  the  market  may also  be pricing  in the  very  small  probability thatthe Committee  will  act  at this meeting,  even  though  it still  views a move  asan extremely unlikely  event.  When markets  begin to  get  anxious,  theysometimes  price in  a little  of that  anxiety.  That  adjustment  may  come out ofthe market  after the  meeting if the Committee  does not  make  any  change.The other kind of adjustment  may be more enduring.Turning  to the next  chart, a  second explanation  that  I mentioned is  thatthe reductions  in Treasury  supply,  both  actual  and  anticipated,  combinedwith  a flat forward  money market  curve recently  have  been  encouragingdealers to extend  duration,  tending  to flatten  the Treasury yield  curve.  Ihope  you will bear with me  while  I explain this chart.At the last  meeting,  I showed the  Committee  a chart  of the yield  curveon  a constant  maturity  basis as each  of the on-the-run  issues  traded throughthe funds rate.  I noted  that with  numerous issues  trading through  the fundsrate,  many  saw that  as encouraging  an  expectation  in  the market  that aneasing move was  coming.  But  showing  you  only the  yield curve  relative tothe  fed funds  target  rate  was an  incomplete  picture.  In  pricing on-the-runTreasury issues, dealers  are not  significantly  constrained  by the level  of thefunds rate.  Rather, their cost of carrying  on-the-run  issues  is reflected  in  theterm-to-date repo  rates.3/31/98In  the  top panel,  the red line  indicates the  10-year  on-the-run  yield.  Thebottom  blue line  is the  term-to-date  RP rate  for the  on-the-run  10-yearmaturity  as it  traded  over the  past  year.  This rate  is  a declining  maturityrepo.  On  the first  day  of a refunding cycle,  it is  a 90-day  instrument;  on  thelast day, it is  a  1-day  instrument.  So, it  has  a declining  maturity as  it  movesacross the  chart.There  are  a  number of factors  that  influence this rate, obviously.  One  isthe  remaining  term.  A second  is the  scarcity  of a Treasury  issue.  As  wemove  through  each  auction  cycle,  the  outstanding Treasury issues  becomemore  and more  scarce.  The on-the-run  issue  is purchased  by people whoactually want  to  hold  it, rather than  just to trade  it or to hedge with  it.  So,  asyou  come to  each  of the  dotted  vertical  lines  on  the  chart, you  see  a  greaterand  greater  scarcity  value.  Of course, the term  structure of the  moneyThe  purpose of the top  panel  is to  help you understand  the bottom  twopanels by putting them in  context.  On  the left,  you can  see  a snapshot  of theentire  yield  curve  and  the  term-to-date  repo  rates for the on-the-run  issues  asof the  Friday before  last  March's  meeting.  On  the right, you  see the sameas  of this past Friday.  Each  of these  dates is roughly in  the middle of theauction  cycles--the  first-quarter  refunding  and the  second-quarter  refunding.They are  off by  only a few days.  What you  can see  is  that  even though  theyield  curve has moved  down,  there is  still  a positive  carry across  the entirecurve.  What  you  also can  see is how much more  attractive  the carry is onthe  10-year now  relative to the  short  end  than it was  last year.The purpose of this rather complicated  picture  is to make two  simplepoints.  First, to be clear,  the marginal  buyers  and  sellers  of on-the-runTreasury  securities  are not  significantly  constrained  by the funds  rate  itselfbut rather by  the cost of financing,  particular  on-the-run  issues in  the repodemand  conditions  for those particular  issues and  by the term  structure  ofthe money  market.Second,  at  present  the positive carry in the market  is making it  relativelymore  attractive  for dealers  to extend  duration  into the  10-year  sector.  So,while  real  investors  or nonleveraged  investors  are being  drawn  out along  theyield curve  in  search  of higher absolute  returns, the  dealers are  being pulledto some  extent into the  10-year sector in  search  of the  carry.  These  are  notthe only  factors that  affect the level  of the yield  curve by  any means, but Ithink they  are  important  ones for us  to  understand.Finally, turning to domestic  operations  on the  last page,  our operationsover the  last period  have  been  detailed  in our  written reports,  and  I thought Iwould focus  on the  upcoming period.  Last May,  Governor Rivlin  chided3/31/98me  and my colleagues  for the $50 billion  positive  surprise  in  the Treasurybalance  relative  to  our projections.  That  positive surprise  reflected  apositive  Treasury  income  surprise.  I thought it might  be helpful  to reviewhow  we are  doing  so far this year and to  anticipate  the Desk's operations  inAt the top  of the page,  we have  shown  the forecasts  and actual  results forlast year's  first two quarters.  At the  top  left  you  can  see the  forecasts  by theTreasury, the  Board, and  the New  York staffs  of first- quarter Treasurybudget  receipts.  The  actual  is shown  in  red and the  percent  errors of thethree forecasts  are  indicated  on the right  side of that  first  box.  In the rightside  panel  at the top,  you  can  see  the 7  to  10  percent  misses  in  projectedTreasury revenues  for the  first quarter that created  the positive  surprises  ofsome  $40 to $50  billion.The next two panels  show  how  we are  doing this  year.  On the left  arethe forecasts  for the first  quarter  by the Treasury,  the Board,  and  the NewYork staffs  and the  preliminary  actual  outcome.  The Treasury's forecastwas  right  on  the money,  and the Board  and New  York are doing  a  littlebetter than  last  year in  their forecasting.  In  the right  panel,  you  see themiddle.The bottom  picture  translates  this  into  our estimates  of the dailyTreasury  balances at  the Fed.  The  latter  rise sharply once  the Treasuryreaches  the  ceiling on its TT&L account  capacity  in the banking system.The differences  between  the New  York and the Board  estimates,  as  Iunderstand  it,  are  not related  to differences  in  nominal  GDP forecasts  but insome  of the  nuances  of tax  collection.  We  do have  a bit  of a gap  here,  butthe estimates  bracket  last year's  actual  Treasury  balances,  the dotted  greenline.I  want to  offer this  as  background  to help you  understand  that  in  thecoming weeks  we  are  likely  to be  changing  some  of the normal  aspects  ofour operations--not  permanently,  but to  deal with  this situation.  First, weare  likely to conduct  another  coupon  pass  in  the next couple of weeks  for $5to  $7  billion  to lay a bit  more  of a reserve  base.Secondly,  when  the need  for reserves  starts to  rise sharply, we  are  likelyto  want to enter the  market  quite early in  the morning,  8:00 or 8:30  a.m.,  sothat we can  insure that we  get sufficient propositions  from  the dealers  tocover our needs.  On  those  occasions,  we are  likely both  to  announce  theday  before that  we  will  be coming into the  market  at, say,  8:30  a.m.  thefollowing  morning,  and  we  would plan  to  conduct  two operations that day.We  would  do  one  in quantity, on  the order  of $10  or $20  billion,  and  come3/31/98back  later in  the day to fine-tune  the total.  I certainly  hope  that thefine-tuning  operation  is  going  to be  in  the  same  direction  as  the morning'soperation.  There is  some risk  it  might  not be,  that we  would  be addingreserves  in the  morning  and  draining  reserves later in  the  day.  If we  didthat,  I would certainly  hope that  we would  be doing them  in  differentmaturities.  We might have  met our basic  reserve objective  for a week or soin  a big  operation  in the  morning  and  then  have to fine-tune  it later  in theday with  an overnight  drain.  I hope  that does  not happen,  but that is apossibility  we  have to bear in  mind if the reserve  needs expand  to levelsclose to either  the  New  York  or the  Board estimate.  Both  estimates  indicatethe need for quite sharp reserve  growth,  and  how  quickly we will  have toexpand  the  scope of our operations will  depend on  how  soon  that needarises.Mr. Chairman,  there were  no foreign  operations  to  report  for this period.I have  provided the Committee  with  annual  reports on  both our domesticopen  market operations  and  our operations  in  foreign  currencies.  I willneed  the  Committee's  ratification  of the  Desk's domestic  operations  duringthe intermeeting  period;  they are  detailed  in  our written  reports.  I would  behappy to  answer any  questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The difference  between  the  New  York Bank  and theBoard  with  respect to Treasury  receipts  is  huge  in  the sense  that  it does  not  appear from thepattern  on the chart  that this  is merely  a displacement  of revenues  from  one  period to  another.New  York's  1998  fiscal  year surplus  is  significantly  higher than the  Board's.  What number  doyou have?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I'm  afraid I don't  have  that number at  my fingertips.  It's  on  the  orderof a $30  billion  surplus  for this  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think  the  higher receipts  in  the  New  York forecast carry through  theend of the  fiscal  year.  In  fact, I think New  York has an  even larger  difference  in  its  forecast  ofthe  fiscal  year surplus because  there  are  some factors  other than  receipts  affecting  their surplusestimates.  But  you are  correct, Mr.  Chairman.  The difference  is  not simply the result  of adisplacement from  quarter to  quarter;  New  York has  a much  larger  surplus.3/31/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is  the Treasury surplus  for the fiscal  year over $50billion  at  this point in  your forecast?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Can  we  go back briefly to  Japan?  I think  we  are  allpuzzled  by the presumption  of the  Japanese authorities  that they can  somehow  have  an  effectiveprogram  to change  the stock  market  and  announce  it.  It is  questionable  enough  to believe  thatthe government  can  substantially  alter the  level of the  stock market.  It is  worse to believe  that itcan announce  its intention  to do so  and  presume  that the  readings  that are going  to occur as  aconsequence  are  going to be taken  seriously  by  anybody.  Most  questionable of all  was theannouncement  yesterday  by the  postal  and  life insurance  system  that they had completed  theirtransfers to purchase  stocks for the period  through  March  31.  You  said  they do  not  have  apolicy.  Having  any  plausible  policy  is better than  none.  If this is  the way  they conduct  theirfinancing  operations,  why  is there  not  far more  significant  negative  reaction  within  Japan  to thistype of operation,  which  seems  so inefficacious?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I wish  I  knew the answer  to that  question.  I certainly  share yourassessment.  When  I said  "no policy,"  I want  to be clear that I was referring  to the marketlooking,  seeing,  and  feeling  that nobody  was home.  There  is  the LDP;  there  is the  cabinet;  thereare the members  of the Diet;  there  are  the  agencies;  these  are the  different decision-makingpoles.  I think the perception  in  the market  is that they  do not  seem  to be talking  to each other,which  is what  I am  implying by no policy.  There is  no center of gravity being provided,  and thatis what I was focusing  on.  On  the  question of whether this  matters, how otherwise  sensiblepeople--3/31/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  One  of the purposes  of their  stock market  operationswas  to create  Basel-weighted  capital  adequacy  ratios for the  March  31  statement  date.  If I  am  acounterparty  funding  some of these Japanese  banks,  I am  not going  to look  at  those  numbers.What  possible  use  are they to me  in judging  the safety  and soundness  of Japanese  institutions  ifthey  are produced  as  if somebody  had  lit a  match  under the  thermometer?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I  think  the counterparties  of the major Japanese  banks  are  looking,unfortunately,  at  the implicit  Japanese  government  guarantee  that appears  to have  beenreaffirmed.  I don't  think  they  are  trading on  the basis  of the capital  adequacy  numbers  whenthey  are trading  with  Japanese  institutions.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  What has  been  the  latest  premium  in the London  marketon  yen  deposits  for Japanese  banks?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  If I  could  make a  comment:  The  people  in  theconvoy  system.  But that is exactly  what  they have  done.  As a result,  the  view is  that the  19largest  banks  have  become  a  sovereign  credit,  and  therefore  the premium  was created  and  thereis still  a premium.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The  premium  has to be  a  reflection  of doubts  about  thesovereign  credit.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Precisely,  and even  though  there  is a perceptionthat the  bank that failed,  Hokkaido Takushoku,  was  managed  reasonably  well  when  it  collapsed,3/31/98the Japanese  are convinced  that  they did a  terrible job  because  they  did  not  anticipate  thecollapse.  I think the  market  is  saying that, yes,  there is  a  convoy  and there  is  sovereign  credit,but if there  is  an  accident,  the winding  down  of the  institution  will  be  managed  very  badly.Therefore, there  is  concern  that  that  could  have  a  contagion effect.  With  reference  to the Baselratios,  I  think there  is a  general  feeling that  the stated ratios  are  meaningless  in  assessing thecondition  of Japanese  banks.  The rest  of us play a  game  where  the ratios  mean something,  butfor the Japanese  banks  they  really  do not.  We have  a  sovereign  credit  with  a question associatedwith  it,  as  you  suggested.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  They have  always had the  opinion  that  since theywould  never let  a bank  fail,  the Basel  ratios  were irrelevant.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Exactly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The fact  that they  agreed  to  the Basel  ratios  has  alwaysimplied  a  very  unusual  admixture.  On  the  one  hand,  every  Japanese  commercial  bank  is  backedby Japan's  sovereign  credit,  and on  the  other hand,  they have  met their Basel  ratios.  This createsconfusion.  It has  to be  terribly  confusing to  a  lot of our  colleagues  in  Japan  who  are  wonderingwhere  all  this is  going.  Other  questions  for Peter?

MR.  JORDAN.  Peter,  you  made what  was  almost  a passing  reference  to the  fact thatintermediate-term  Treasuries  had  traded  through  the funds  rate  this  year,  and  you indicated  thatmany  saw  that development  as  reflecting  expectations  of some  easing in  the  funds rate.  But thealternative explanation  is that  trading through  the  funds rate  is consistent  with  an  expectation  thatthe funds rate  will  be increased.  We  had at  least  a  brief discussion  of that  on  the call  over the  lastweek  or so.  With  regard  to our credibility  as  a  central  bank,  one  of your  people  commented thatif in  a gold  standard  type  world  there  was growing  credibility  that the  central  bank  was going  to3/31/98take  the appropriate  policy actions  to  maintain  price  stability, one  would expect  intermediate-term  issues to trade through  the  overnight  interbank  rate.  Do  you  want  to elaborate?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I  don't think  I need  to.  I  think  you've said  it  very  well.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  I'm  asking  about  Street  talk or views  on this  issue.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I  don't think  the Street's  focus on  that hypothesis  would  be  at the shortend  of the  coupon  curve,  but if there were  an  anticipation  of an  easing  move, the Street  wouldtalk  about  expecting a  rally  further  out  on  the yield  curve.  In  January,  in  fact, we  observed whatI was  talking  about in  the  chart  that I showed  at the  last meeting.  As I  said then,  I think theinterpreted  as indicating  an  increased  likelihood  of an easing action.  That is  when  the  short  endof the coupon  curve  traded  through  the funds  rate.  I do  not  dispute that  what  you  have  describedcan  happen  and  the Street  does  talk  about it that way,  but  what was  happening  in  January  was theother  scenario.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  But wouldn't  it also reflect,  President Jordan,  the expectation  that,unless there  was  a negative  term  premium,  nominal  short-term  rates  would  fall  at  some point  sothat  the expected  holding  period  yield from rolling  over  overnight  instruments  and two-yearinstruments  would  be equal.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  I  was  thinking more in  terms of the  5-  to 10-year range.  If peopleanticipated a transitory  acceleration  of inflation that we  would respond  to, we would  expect theyield curve  to be downward  sloping in  that longer-term  range.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Right,  because  inflation  would come  down  and  short-term rates  wouldmove  up.3/31/98

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for Peter?  If not,  would  somebodylike to  move  to ratify the actions  of the Desk?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So moved.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let  us  move on  to Mike Prell  andLarry Promisel.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I think it would  beappropriate  for me to begin this morning  by acknowledging  that,  yes,  youdid tell  us  so last  month.  You said  that  our GDP forecast  for this  yearprobably  was too low,  and  now we  have  raised it appreciably.  Moreover,  alittle reading  between  the  lines of the  Greenbook  would  indicate  that,  evenwith  the revisions we  have made,  we  are somewhat  more  concerned  aboutthe possible  upside  risks to our forecasts  for demand  and  inflation  thanabout  the  downside risks.With  that as preamble,  let me  engage in  a little  mind-reading andattempt to  anticipate  a few  of the  questions  you  might  have  about ourrevised  forecast.First, isn't  the upward-revised  GDP  growth  rate  of 3.1  percent  thatwe're  showing for the  first quarter  still rather skimpy,  especially  in  light  ofthe strength  of the labor market  indicators?That's  certainly a reasonable  question.  Judging by the growth  ofemployment  and  hours through  February  and  the continuing  low  level  ofjobless  claims,  the increase  in  labor input  almost  surely was well  above  theaverage  of recent quarters.  Moreover,  the  data on  consumption,  housing,and  equipment purchases  point to  a large gain  in  private  domestic  finalsales.  However, it is  also  true that the January  figures  for net  exports  andinventory  investment  were  much  weaker than their respective  fourth-quarteraverages.  Even when  we  plug in  what  seem like  ample  numbers for thesetwo  variables  in February  and March,  we  still  end  up with  a drop-off  in GDPgrowth.But, you  might  ask, doesn't that just  imply an  implausible  drop in  laborproductivity?  Yes,  it does imply  a drop, but obviously  not one  we  findimplausible.  Output per hour has  risen  considerably  in  the past two yearsrelative  to the  underlying  trend embedded  in our projection--the  kind  ofpickup  that one might expect  to accompany  an  acceleration  of production.If we  have it right, a movement  back toward the  trend line  was to beexpected  over time--and,  given  the erratic  character  of the  series,  asubstantial  drop  in  some quarter  would be  far from shocking.  That  said, in3/31/98the present  case, we  also  would not  be stunned  if the spending  data  comingin  over the  next  few  weeks  were  to point  to  a larger gain in  Q1  GDP.Well,  you are  thinking, the first quarter is  history, anyway;  so  the realquestion  is  what makes  us  think that the still  greater  moderation  of GDPgrowth  that we long have  been forecasting  is here  at last?  Isn't  domesticdemand  proving  to be  strong  enough to override  any  damping effect  thatmight  be coming from  the external  sector?It  certainly is  conceivable  to  me  that what  we are  going  through  nowwill turn  out  to be the  obverse  of the  1987-88  experience.  In  that case,  astrong  upswing  in net  exports  helped to keep  the economic  expansion  ontrack  in the face  of the  stock market  decline.  This time around,  a boomingstock market  might  offset the effects of a  slump in net  exports.However,  a few  considerations  lead  us to  conclude  that this  scenario isnot the  most likely.  I  will  leave it  for Larry to  discuss the  incomingevidence on the  trade front.  Suffice it  to  say at  this point that the  recentnews  has  not undermined  our notion that  there is--and will  be for  awhile--an  appreciable  drag  on  activity coming  from the  external  sector.  It isnot just  an  Asia  story; it  is also the lagged  effects  of a sizable  cumulativeappreciation  of the dollar over the  past  few  years.But,  that  said, could we  be seriously  underestimating  the ongoing thrustof domestic  demand?  As  we look  at  it  sector by  sector, we  do not think  wehave  stinted on  expenditures.  Among  other things, demand  has beenboosted  recently by the decline  in  longer-term  interest  rates  over the  pastyear,  and  we  do not foresee that  interest  rate trend being extended  in  anymeaningful  way.  As  many have  commented,  this has in  part been  thedividend  of the  Asian crisis  for the  U.S.  economy.  To be  sure, the  predictedsoftening  in economic  indicators  could  revitalize  hopes of Fed  easing.  But,unless the  bond  market bulls  are able  to  push  yields  materially below  therecent  range, this  should not provide a great amount  of additional  stimulus.Where we  might be especially  vulnerable,  though,  is with  respect to thestock market.  At this point, it  appears  that the  market  has entered  a phase  inwhich  the  gravitational  pull  of valuation  may no  longer be operating.  ThePE ratio for the S&P  500 recently  reached  27,  based  on  trailing  12-monthearnings, even  as  companies  were  issuing warnings  and  analysts  werelowering  their 1998  profit forecasts.  In  the prevailing  psychologicalenvironment,  with people increasingly  convinced  that the market  willinevitably  yield returns  vastly greater than  those  available today  on  liquidfixed-income  instruments,  the market can  keep  going appreciably  higher  onits  own  momentum--at  least  until  there  is  an  event jarring  enough to causepeople to  reassess  their  general  view of the world.3/31/98For now,  the  market  is  an  integral  part of a perpetual  motion machinethat  keeps the  economy  powering  ahead.  We  have  seen  this  before, recentlyin  Asia,  and  while  I do not  want to  overstate  that  comparison,  the  issuesabout  bubbles  that  the Chairman  raised  in his  famous  "irrationalexuberance"  speech  do  seem increasingly  relevant.  We pointed  out onceagain  in  the Greenbook  the  difference  it might  make to the outlook  if thesomewhat,  as  we have predicted.  If the  market  were instead to  keepzooming upward  at 20 or 30 percent per  year, then  the  consequences  foraggregate  demand  and thus  for inflationary  pressures  could be quite  striking.This brings  me to a final  question.  There  seems  to have  been  someincrease in  concern  about inflation  risks of late, with commentators  notingsuch things  as  the continued  tightness  of the  labor markets,  the recent  upturnin oil  prices,  or the heating  up  of real  estate markets.  Is there  somethinggoing on  here beyond  what we  have captured  in the  Greenbook?  Perhaps,but we think  that  the upward  revision  we have  made to  our inflation  forecastleaves  the risks reasonably  balanced--assuming  that the  predicted  output andunemployment  path  is about  right.As  we noted  in  the Greenbook, increases  in average  hourly  earnings--the only broad  statistic  yet  available  for this year--have  not been  gettingdiscernibly  larger  or smaller of late.  However, the  anecdotal  reports  seem  tobe indicating  with  increasing frequency  an  acceleration  of compensationrates and  an  increase  in  recruiting  and  training  costs.  The  picture is  stilluneven,  with  many firms saying they are  holding the  line on  pay and  othersthat  they are tightly  targeting increases  to  those workers  in key positions  orwith  "hot"  skills.  And,  where pay is  raised,  it often  is through flexible  formsof compensation  that can be trimmed  more  easily  when business  slackens--afeature  that we  think  may be significant  in determining  the  momentum  ofwage  inflation  going  forward.  In  the end, we bowed  only  slightly to theanecdotal  news  and raised  our compensation  forecast just  a touch  more thanwe  would have on  the basis  of the  lower  unemployment  rates in  thisprojection.At this point, we  are  sticking with  the  notion that the decline  ininflation and  inflation  expectations  over the  past year will  exert  a significantdamping influence  on  nominal  wage  increases.  Thus far in  1998,  the  trendin  overall  CPI  inflation has  remained  very favorable,  owing  to the  sharpthe outlook for this  sector through  1999  now looks  more favorable  than itdid in  late  January,  and  we  have  lowered  our forecast for retail  energyprices.On the other hand,  though  it may be  splitting  hairs to  say that the  coreCPI has  increased  more rapidly  on  average  in  the  past couple of months,3/31/98there certainly  has  not  been  any further downside  surprise  there.  Thedeflationary  impact of the  Asian  crisis  appears  to be no  greater  than  weanticipated,  and  with  a  slightly lower  dollar exchange  rate  path this  time,  theprojected  decline in  non-oil  import prices  outside the semiconductor  andcomputer  sector is  a  little  shallower.  Overall,  our interpretation  of theincoming  price news--coupled  with the  more inflationary  labor  marketconditions  in this  projection--has  been  mirrored  in  the quarter-pointelevation  of our core  CPI  forecast.In  concluding,  I  might remind  you  that we  have  not  built into  thebaseline  projection  any allowance  for the big  hike in  cigarette prices  thatlooms  as  a  distinct  possibility.  The legislative proposals  keep changing,  asthey  did just yesterday,  and  the  only thing that  seems  certain  right now isthat there  are  lots  of people willing to  provide the manufacturers  with  anexcuse  to raise their  prices  sharply.  It  is easy  to  come up with  numbers  thatwould add  several  tenths  to  the CPI inflation  rate  at some  point.  This  wouldpresent  the Committee with  a  challenge  it has not faced  in some  time--thatis,  deciding  whether to  accommodate  an  adverse,  rather than  a  favorable,supply  shock.Larry  will  now  comment  on  factors  bearing  on  the external  outlook.

[SECTION]

MR.  PROMISEL.  I  would  like to highlight four  areas  of uncertainty  onthe  international  side:  the  crises in  Asia,  Japan,  oil,  and  the  dollar.First, the  crises in  Asia:  There is  an  Asia  effect,  although  we  do nothave  a  systematic  handle  on  it.  We see evidence  in the  trade  statistics  of theAsian  economies  themselves.  The combined  trade  balance  of Korea  andThailand in  November-December  swung  from  a deficit of $5  billion  in  1996to a surplus  of $4  billion  in  1997--a  swing of more than $50 billion  at  anannual  rate.  We see  evidence  of it from  the  U.S.  side:  Trade  statistics forU.S.  purchasing  managers'  survey  reports  weak  export orders.  Theanecdotal  reports  from  the  special  survey  conducted  by the  Reserve  Bankscontribute substantially  to  our sense  of the weakness  in exports  to Asia.And  we  see  evidence  in the  trade  statistics  of Japan  and Europe.  Based  onall  of this  somewhat  fragmentary  information,  most  of the effect  to dateseems  to be  on  the  side  of Asian  imports,  not  Asian  exports.The  question  now  is not  whether there is  a noticeable  effect,  but  ratherhow  large  and how  long-lasting  that effect  will  be.  On  that score,  about  all  Iwould  assert  is that the  probability  of some of the  more  negative  scenariosthat we  and  others have talked  about has  diminished.  While the problems  inAsia  certainly  have not  been  solved, the  situation  outside  of Indonesia--andperhaps  Malaysia--seems  to have  stabilized,  and we  can  be  a  bit moreconfident  that  at  least some  of the  needed  reforms  and policy  measures  will3/31/98be  implemented.  The evident  resolve  of the  new  government in  Korea  andthe  success  of the rescheduling  effort  for claims  on  Korean  banks haveadded  importantly to  our degree  of confidence.Second,  Japan:  Recent  data--including  fourth-quarter  GDP  andindicators  for the  first quarter--suggest  that the Japanese  economy  is  evenweaker than  we had been  expecting.  Progress  on resolving  the problems  ofthe  Japanese banking  system  is  slow,  at  best.  On the  other hand,  substantialfiscal  stimulus has  been  signaled,  although  the  details  are  missing, and  thereis  some prospect  for  stimulus  in the  form of tax  cuts.  What remains to  beseen,  of course,  is how  much  so-called  "real  water" there  will be behind  theheadline  figures.  I  would  say there  is  now  some  upside risk,  not justdownside  risk, to the outlook  for Japan  that is presented  in  the Greenbook.Third,  oil: The  decline in  oil  prices  through  mid-March  was  a  surprise.If that had  been  sustained,  it would  have  been  a  central  element  in therevision  to our Greenbook  forecast  since  January.  Of course,  the decline  hasnot been  sustained.  Oil  producing  countries  have responded  with  anagreement  to cut  production,  and their decision  is  sufficiently credible  thatprices  have  backed  up quite  a bit.  We  anticipate  that prices  will  stay  nearcurrent levels,  with  expanded  exports  from  Iraq working  to keep prices  fromrising further later this  year and next.  The  price  of oil  in  our forecast  for1999  is now  $2  per barrel  lower  than  in  the January  Greenbook.  We thinkthe  risks to oil  prices  are  fairly  evenly balanced  around the forecast  path.  Imight  note that the price  of oil  in  our forecast  also  is  about $4.50  per barrellower on  average  in  1998  than it  was in  1997.  The decline in  price from  lastyear  plays  a  significant  role in  the allocation  of the  burden  of currentaccount  adjustments  in  the world  and  tends to  some extent  to  support  globalaggregate  demand.Fourth,  the  dollar:  We  have  a  small  decline in  the dollar's  value builtinto our forecast,  in  both  nominal  and real  terms  against the  yen  andEuropean  currencies  and  in  real  terms  against  the currencies  of emergingshort run,  we  see some  upside  risks.  The  market  may continue  to bedisappointed  in the  performance  of the  Japanese  economy,  putting furtherdownward pressure  on  the  yen.  Problems  in  Indonesia  could  spread  andAsian  currencies  could  weaken  again.  Persistent  vigor of the  U.S.  economycould entice  investors.  And  while the process  leading  toward  the next  stageof EMU seems  to  be on  track,  there  is  scope  for problems--associated,  forexample,  with  the  German  election in  September.  However,  over the  longerterm,  what we  see  as  the need  for the  dollar to  decline to begin to  correctU.S.  current  account  imbalances  could assert itself, as  some  of the factorsthat have  been  putting upward  pressure  on the  dollar diminish  in  force: uncertainties  related to EMU,  the Asian  crises,  and  even  the  weakness  inJapan.the3/31/98Putting all  four elements  together, I myself  see the  balance  of risksskewed  toward  the  upside,  in terms of the  foreign impact  on  U.S.  demandand prices.  My  colleagues  probably  would not be  so  unequivocal,  but thenagain,  this  is not their last FOMC  meeting!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Larry, I noticed  that  in  the last couple of days  we  havehad  a particularly  strong  trade-weighted  dollar.  How  much  is the  dollar  above expectations  inthe final  Greenbook  forecast, which  I assume was  put together  a  week to ten days  ago?

[SECTION]

MR.  PROMISEL.  How  much higher depends  on  what you  mean  by the  dollar.  Thereare  a lot of different ways  of weighting  and  characterizing  the  dollar's average  value.  It  has goneup  some against  the  yen,  but  I don't  think there  has  been  a big change in  terms  of the  variousweighted  averages that  we use.  I am  looking  for one  average  that we employ--it  was  101.3--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is the  G-10 weighted  average?

[SECTION]

MR.  PROMISEL.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  On that  average, the dollar  is about one  percent higher than it  was atthe  time the  Greenbook  went  to press.

[SECTION]

MR.  PROMISEL.  That's against  the other G-10  currencies,  but it is up less than  thatpresumably  against  some  of the  other  weighted averages.  It  does  not change  the basic picture.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The  recent appreciation  is still  noise  as  far  as  theGreenbook  forecast is concerned?

[SECTION]

MR. PROMISEL.  Absolutely, in  our  view.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Supposing the  fiscal  year surplus  number comes  incloser to the New  York  Bank's estimate than  ours.  That  would  seem  to be  outside the  noiserange in  terms of the implications  for fiscal  drag.  What  kind of response  would you have if weaccepted  their numbers  for receipts?  What  happens?3/31/98

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  we  need to consider  what  the source of that difference  might bebefore  we  would  characterize that  as fiscal  drag.  We have not  gotten totally  inside  their brains tobe able to  say exactly why their numbers  differ from  ours,  but it  appears  that one  element in  thepicture  is,  in  effect, New York's expectation  of much  larger revenues  from  capital  gains.  Wenormally would  not  think  of that  as  a particularly  restrictive  fiscal element.  People  get wealthier;they presumably  anticipate that  they will be paying  more taxes;  and  they are not  bound by  anyliquidity  constraint, given  their  wealth.  So, if that  is the  source of the difference,  we  would notregard  that as implying  much  additional  fiscal  restraint.  Also,  I wouldn't  say  at this point thatthe difference  is outside the  range of normal  noise.  We  have  had  some  substantial  surprises inthe  last few  years.  As the  economy  gets  bigger  and bigger,  the possible  dollar errors  grow.  Evenso, it  is  a significant  difference,  and  we  shall know  a lot more in  the  next few  weeks.  Some  ofthis is  speculation  about  whether  people  anticipated  their  tax liabilities  for last  year better thanthey did for the previous  few  years.  There  also is  uncertainty  about  the sources  of the income.We  are  not  adamant  in  saying that the New York  forecast  is wrong,  and  I am  sure that  they arehumble  about  the precision  of their forecasting  ability, too,  at this juncture.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Absolutely!  I put  in  last year's  actuals to show  that the  range ofmisses  was 7  to  10 percent.  That  had a  huge impact in  dollar terms.  But I was also  offering thatexperience to provide  some scale of the  forecasting  errors involving big numbers.  If we  couldget Desk operations  to have misses  of only  10  percent over a  24-hour horizon,  we would  bedoing  awesomely well.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It is  my understanding that  the  difference in  the projections  of thesurplus  for the fiscal  year,  which  I believe  is on  the  order of $40 billion,  is mostly on  the revenue3/31/98side, but  not all  of it  is there.  There  are the  ongoing questions  concerning  how appropriationswill  play  out in  terms  of authorizations  and  expenditures.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Do you  have  any rule of thumb regarding  the  effect  ofchanges  in crude  oil  prices  on the  core  CPI--some  notion  of the feed-through?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I  cannot cite  a rule  of thumb off the  top of my head,  but in  some  of ourmodels  we  do have  terms for food  and  energy  prices  feeding  through  to the  core  CPI.  We  did  asimulation  that indicated  that  the  effect of the  downward  movement  in energy  prices  in  ourforecast  on  the  core  inflation  rate  this  year is somewhere  between  .1 and  .2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It  is quite  substantial  in  other words.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It  is not negligible,  to  be  sure.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Mr. Chairman,  we  have  done a  little work  along  the same lines.  Ourstaff has what  we  call  the  median  CPI or the  trimmed  mean.  The effects  are  on the  order ofmagnitude  that  you  suggest,  Mike,  from what  I  recall  our  people were  saying.  They  arecontinuing work  to  evaluate  those  indirect effects.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mike,  I  have  two questions that  are  somewhat  related.  The Greenbookstresses  that labor markets  are  very tight and  that the  tightness could  lead to increases  in realcompensation.  But increases  in real  wages in  the  Greenbook  forecast  actually  decline  in  1999.For example,  the ECI decelerates  by  .5  percentage  point  relative to  the CPI.  In fact,  real  wageinflation  may even  be  going  down more than that if one believes  that wage  earners  bargain  interms  of what  they see  on Main  Street  rather  than  what  they read  in  the newspaper  about  the  CPI,which,  of course,  is  affected  by the technical  adjustments.  Could  you  comment  on why realwages  are  decelerating  in the forecast  where  you have  the economy  operating  at  such  a  high  leveland  with  such  little slack?3/31/98

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We do not  have  real  wages declining,  but in  1999  the gap  between  theECI increase  and the CPI  increase  is smaller.  We are  not at all  sure  that  that is the  number tofocus  on.  In  fact, we  prefer to focus on  a product  price measure rather than the  consumer priceindex in  looking  at real  wages,  and  it feeds  through,  too, to  the implications  for income  shares.We have had  very substantial  acceleration  of real  compensation  gains over the past  two years.We are anticipating  sizable  further increases  in  1998 and  1999.  In  1999,  it  is a  smaller increaseand  one  could  explain that in part  by the fact that we project  a little  upcreep  in the unemploymentrate.  We also  are banking to  some degree  on  the  notion that the ECI and  other wage  measureshave  been  boosted over the past  year or  so by minimum  wage hikes.  These are not  present inthis  projection.  One could regard that,  I suppose,  as  another upside  risk on  the inflation  outlookbecause  there obviously is  discussion,  albeit  fitful, of further minimum  wage  increases.  We alsosaw a very  big increase  in commissions  and  bonuses  in the  latter part  of 1997,  which  we thinkprobably  will  be repeated  in  the first  quarter of 1998.  These  are associated  in  part  with  the hugelevel  of profits and  activity  in  the financial  and  real estate  sectors.  We foresee  an  abatement  ofthat  contribution  to compensation  increases  as we  move forward.As I said  earlier, we  are fairly convinced  by all  the  anecdotal  and  survey  evidence--indicating  that employers  have been  utilizing more flexible  forms of compensation  such  as cashbonuses  and  incentive  pay of various sorts--that  future  adjustments  to compensation  should bemore  sensitive than previously  to  a deceleration  in  the  economic expansion  and  a falloff inprofitability  such  as  we have in  our forecast.  In  other words,  the  inertia in adjustments  tocompensation  that formerly might  have  been  present in  such circumstances  may not quite  asevident  in this  cycle.  Those are  the elements  that  lead us  to be fairly  sanguine  about theprospects  for holding the  line on  nominal  compensation  increases  even  in this tight labor  market.3/31/98We still  anticipate  sizable  increases  in  real  wages that we  think are  in  general  conformity withthe  Phillips curve model.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Related  to  a point that you  made  in  your comments  about the  anecdotaldata pertaining  to  inflation  and  how they might be  at  variance  with  some  of the  publishedstatistics, might  that  be related  to the  fact that the  anecdotal  data  reflect  what people  see?  TheCPI certainly  includes  the effect  of technical  adjustments.  Might  this discrepancy  actuallyincrease  over time because,  as  you  show in  the Greenbook,  the  technical  adjustment to the  coreCPI  is probably going to be  on the order  of .6  percent  in  1999?  Of course,  people  do not  seethat; they only  read  about  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I am  not  sure about  the ability of John  Q.  Public to  filter out all  thecumulative  changes  from the  1994  approach  to measuring  consumer prices  to the  method  used in1999.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  They  never see it except when  they read  about it.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In  the  world  of instantaneous  flows  of information,  all  the  economistswill  be  talking  about it  and maybe  it will  filter out into the real  world  to  some  degree.  I  guess weare not totally persuaded  one way or the other on this.  We  are inclined to think that  in terms  offormal  cost  of living  adjustments  and,  more informally,  to the extent  that  people look  at what theCPI has  done  over the past  year, they are  probably going to be  influenced to  a considerabledegree  by  the  headline number.  I did  note  some tension  between  the  anecdotal  and the  statisticalnews  on  the wage  side.  This  does make us  nervous.  In  our survey  that  all  the Reserve  Banksparticipated  in,  the focus  was  more on  what business firms  are doing, if anything,  if they  areexperiencing  a shortage.  I think  a majority  of the firms  that were  in that  predicament  said theywere  doing  something.  But I think it  is difficult to judge the  timing and  dimension  of an3/31/98acceleration--how  much  more they are doing now  than they were doing before.  And  in general,based on  this anecdotal  evidence,  I  wonder if there  isn't  some  sort of Heisenberg problem  here.We are looking  so  hard and  we  are asking  so many  people  that  one  wonders  whether  we arefinding a few more  stories  than we  would have  if we  did not  have a neutral  expectation  aboutwhat  was going  on.  We are  a bit nervous  about this, but  I think  there is  a little upside risk  in thewage  outlook.On  the price  side, I believe the  markets and  the  commentators  have  gotten  a whiff ofthe  inflation that may be  out there.  Recent  housing  market  developments  have intensified  thatimpression.  The indexes have  been distorted by  shifts in  geographic  mix, but  I think the largeincrease in prices that was  reported  in  connection  with  this  new home  sales figure  the other dayis  one more  instance where people  are  not looking  at those  subtleties.  What  they sense  is thatthis is  a really hot market  and prices  may be moving.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Mike,  you mentioned  that oil  prices are one  of the temporary factorsthat are affecting  inflation;  in  fact  oil prices are  even  affecting core CPI.  The other key factor, ofcourse,  is  the dollar.  I'm wondering  if you've  done any simulations  or have  any  quantitativeestimates  as to what the  impact of the stronger  dollar  has been  on  the core  CPI last  year and  thisyear.

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  President  Moskow,  our model  estimates  suggest  an  effect of about1/4  percentage point  per year over the  last couple  of years  on core  CPI from  the lower  nonoilimport prices,  simulating forward  from  1995.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Does that include  1998?3/31/98

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  Yes,  there may be  another quarter percentage  point  or so for  1998.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  This is  an  area  in  which economic  science  has not  given  us anythingthat we want to  stake  our  lives  on.  We  have  various results  with the various  models,  but I thinkwe  are persuaded  that the  appreciation  of the  dollar  has had  a significant  effect.  Looking at  whatis going on  in the  goods markets,  I think the  evidence  is quite  persuasive that we  are  getting  asignificant  effect.  As we  go forward, the waning  of  that effect,  given  our dollar assumption,  doesadd  a little to the  acceleration  of prices  that we have  in the  forecast.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR.  PROMISEL.  We  do have  a bit  of a lag built  in between  the exchange  rate  changeand  the effect on import  prices.  So, even  if the  dollar starts  coming off its  current  level,  we willsee  some effects in  terms of lower  nonoil import  prices  for  a little while.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Mike,  you  correctly  anticipated  a question  that I had,  but in  at  leastone  respect your presentation  added  to  a puzzle  that I had  when  I read  the Greenbook  and someof the  other materials.  You have  personal  income  growth  picking  up to  a 6.7  percent rate  in thefirst quarter from  a relatively  robust  pace last  year  and in  fact from  an  upward trend  over the lastfive years.  Employment  growth  has been  very  strong along with hours  worked.  There  is strongdemand  for output,  strong demand  for workers,  and  spending has  been  very  robust. The  stocksales,  housing starts,  and  housing permits,  and  business  fixed  investment remains  on  a sharpuptrend.  Then  I read  the  first  sentence  of the  draft directive that  says "the information  reviewedat this meeting  suggests  that the expansion  in economic  activity may have slowed  somewhat."3/31/98

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  All  of that reflects  the arithmetic  that  I described  at the  outset as to howwe have added  up  the  GDP components.  There is  the tension between  the  labor input indicatorsand  what we  can add  up  on  the expenditures  side.  We've  seen this before.  We will  see  it again.It leaves a lot  of room for surprise,  but  we  have reconciled  this discrepancy  by pumping up themissing expenditure  numbers  as much  as we felt was reasonable,  particularly  on the  inventoryside.  We  are left  with the  implication  that there was  a substantial  decline  in  productivity in thefirst  quarter.  As I said, that is not inconceivable  to  us in  terms of our general  outlook  on thecyclical,  so to speak,  element  of productivity  performance  over the forecast  period.  However,the quarterly  change  in productivity  is  sharp  and that  raises  a question.  We might  yet find  thatGDP growth  did not  slow  in  the first quarter.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Let us  suppose  it is true that real GDP  growth  in  the  first quarter,  asyou  have  added it  up, is  a smaller number than  that  for the fourth  quarter.  In  the face  of all theseother indications  of strength,  do  we really  want to characterize  the economy  in  the first  quarter asa weakening  in  economic  activity  even  though  the real  GDP growth  number may bearithmetically  smaller for the  reasons  that  you indicated?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  This is a policy issue  on which  I have no expertise.  You  are askingwhether  I am comfortable  with  that?  I guess what  you  are saying  is that  the  characterization  ofeconomic  activity need not be a reference  to GDP growth  per se,  because  the latter may notcapture the  sense one has  of the vitality of the economy in  the  first  quarter of the year.  Perhapsthere is  some other way that  you folks might  want  to express your  view of what  you  heard at  thismeeting.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Let me  take  you to the productivity  issue then.  Nothing  that any  of ushears  anecdotally  when  we  talk to people or other evidence  that we  can  look at  would support3/31/98your first-quarter  productivity  estimate.  I understand  how it is derived  and  why you  wind  upwith  this negative  productivity  number,  shocking as  it is.  It is  a residual.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Can  we  stipulate  that  measured productivity  is distinctfrom true  productivity?

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Somehow  statistically  arrived at!  When I was talking  to Don Kohnlast week,  he  told me that the decline  did not happen  and that productivity  probably  rose by, say,2 percent.  Starting  with that  presumption,  what else has to  change in  your  forecast if you  areforced  to put in  a positive  productivity  number  for the  first  quarter?  Also, what is  the net  goingto  look like?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  If we talk  about it  simply  from  a straight  arithmetic  point of view,obviously we would have to find some  more expenditures.  Where  might we  find them?  It  couldbe in  any number of places.  One  could  conceive  that,  despite what  looks  like a  very  strongconsumer  expenditure  number  in  the  first quarter,  people  really have had  a  lot of income,  thoughit  is overstated  in the  first-quarter number because  of seasonal  adjustment  quirks.  Nonetheless,consumer spending  is  strong and  is  supported  by a lot of wealth  and people  feeling really  great.So,  there  could  be  an  even boomier  picture  in consumer  expenditures  than we have  projected.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  So you  would be raising not just the  real  output  number but thenominal  GDP?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In  the end,  BEA  is only  going to publish  a number  that adds  up on  theexpenditure  side,  and  the productivity  numbers  are measured  that  way.  So, that is  how we  aregoing  to have to get there.  We  have only one  month of data  for net exports  and that is a volatilenumber, so we could be surprised there.  Over the  past year we have been  surprised on finalsales,  and  there has been  an  accompanying  upside  surprise  on  inventory  investment.  We could3/31/98see larger  amounts  of inventory  investment that would  be consistent with  higher  final  sales andwith  our basic  sense  that no  troublesome  accumulation  has been  occurring.  Getting  up  to 4 or 5percent  GDP  growth is  not totally  implausible.  We could  also have  some revisions in  theemployment figures  or something  precipitously  on the  weak  side  in March  that would make  upfor the string  of upside  surprises  that have  helped  to  generate this weak  productivity  number.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  When  you  try to  reconcile  the  data  and make  them  consistent  on  theincome  side, is your  negative productivity  number tied in  with the  decline  in corporate  profitsthat  you're showing?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Again,  arithmetically  it is.  Certainly,  what  we  have  in  this  forecast for1998  in  essence  is  a  story  where  unit labor costs  are  increasing  more rapidly  because of thelagging  adjustment  of labor input to the  deceleration  in  output.  Weaker productivity  meansweaker  profits.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  You  can  imagine  what  it's like when  we  are  out around our Districtstalking  to people  and we  tell  them  that productivity  is  going  down,  profits  are  really  bad,  butemployers  are hiring workers  in large  numbers  because they  are  earning  income  and spending  alot  of money.  Something  just goes  "clunk"  in  that  logic; it  simply does  not sound quite right.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I  think they have  been  hiring people  in part because business  has  beenvery  good  and  they expect  business  to continue  to be good.  On the basis  of the  anecdotal  reports,firms have  had  such a  difficult  time  finding workers  that they're probably  still catching  up  tosome degree.  That  may  be  one of the reasons  the workweek  has been  on the  firmer side  than  wewould  have expected,  even  allowing  for statistical  problems.  I  think that  continues  to happen.There is  momentum  to this process.  If we  get that stronger first  quarter,  it is  going to implyaccelerator effects  and  possibly a  stronger  investment  outlook  beyond.  If we  get that3/31/98performance  and  stronger  profits,  it  calls  into  question  our expectation  of a weaker  stock  market.So,  one  could  envision,  as  happened  last  year, that  things could  come  together in  a way  thatpropels  the economy  forward  and  keeps  going  on  with  the  support  of the financial  markets.  Onthe other hand,  that would  imply that we might  be moving toward  a 4  percent  rate ofunemployment  this  year,  and  I think  that strains  one's sense,  given  what one  can  already  see, ofwhat  is possible without  really  substantial  inflation  pressures.

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  As a  statistical  matter,  President Jordan,  there are  a couple  ofquirks  in  this minus  2.2  percent  productivity  number that  we have  for the first quarter.  Onerelates  to  the  fact  that we think  the  10-  and  11  -day  pay period  seasonal  adjustment  problem  hasled to  an  artificially  large increase  in  hours  worked  in  the first quarter.  The second  is that,  as  youthat were  boosting  productivity  to  well  in  excess  of the  2  percent  underlying  number that  youwere just  talking  about.  Some  of that appears  to be  going  away  now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any  further  questions  for the  gentlemen?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mike, I  have the  impression  that the possibility of a stock  marketbe interested  in  some  sort  of quantitative  relationship  here.  Are  you  expecting  a  permanent  dropin the market?  Is it something  that is going  to be  extended  and  sustained?  If we  had  a  normalcorrection,  something  like  a  10 percent  correction  or like the correction  that we had  in the  fourthquarter, that really  might not have  much  of an  impact on  aggregate  demand.  So,  I'm  wonderingwhat  underlies the quantitative  dimensions  of this  aspect  of your forecast.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It could be less.  I apologize  if word about  what we are  assuming didnot get  to  you.  We  have  a  10  percent  decline  in the market  from  its level  last week to the end  of3/31/98the  year and  we  then  have  a  flat market  in  1999.  So,  in  comparison  to what we've  seen  in  thepast few  years,  which  as  I recall  were  a  couple of close-to-10-percent  corrections  that  werequickly reversed,  this more permanent  correction  would be  a  distinct  contrast.  We provided  asimulation  in the Greenbook  of an  alternative  GDP path in  which  in  essence  the  stock marketrises roughly 5 percent  a  year, enough  to keep  pace  with  the  growth  of nominal  disposal  income.It  makes  some material  difference  when  we move  out to  1999.  As I  suggested  in  my remarks,  ifyou think  the market  can  do appreciably  better  than that--and  that is really  a  paltry performanceby the standards  of recent  years or in  relation  to  what the  average  investor seems  to beexpecting--then  the  economy's  performance  will be  dramatically  different  as  we move  out into1999.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions?  If not,  would  someone  like to  startthe roundtable?  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank  you.  When  I  left the  meeting  in  early February,  we  werewaiting for the  East Asian  effects  to get here,  and  as I  tried  to  analyze their likely impact  I  feltlike  someone  who  was  trying to  anticipate  what would be the  effects  of  an  asteroid  or a  cometthat  supposedly  was going  to show  up  one  of these  days.  A  couple  of weeks  after our meeting,there  was in fact  a  report  about  an  asteroid  that might reach  the earth  in about  30  years.[Laughter]  Upon  further  analysis that report was  very quickly  dismissed.  Almost  25 years  ago,we were all  treated to reports  of the coming  of the  comet  Kohoutek.  Comet  Kohoutek  was  goingto do  wondrous  things.  It was  going  to be the brightest  celestial  object  of the century,  and therewas speculation  that it might  change  the earth's rotation  and  weather patterns.  Of course,  it  wasa complete  fizzle  and  no one  will remember  it.  As  I thought  about  such  phenomena,  it  occurredto me that asteroids  and  comets are  less predictable  than  eclipses.  But  even  eclipses, though3/31/98predictable,  are  often  very  hard to  observe  because  there  is so much  other  activity in  theatmosphere  that even  a trained  scientist  may need  powerful  instruments  to observe  one.I then thought about  El  Nino, which has  been  wonderful  for my part of the  country thiswinter.  The lesson  there is that  even when  phenomena  are  accurately  forecasted  and  exceedanticipations,  the  effects  are  sometimes  hard to analyze.  If one analyzed  El  Nino's effect  on  thebasis  of expensive  California  homes  falling into the ocean,  one  would  have  a different  picturethan if one  lived  around  Lake Erie and  saw  what  a wonderful  winter we  had  in our part of thecountry.  The schools did  not  close.  The people  who drive  salt  trucks  complained  about the lackof overtime,  but  other than that the experience  was relatively  positive.  If we put such  disparateobservations  into a full  general  equilibrium  context,  it  really is  very  hard to sort  them out.  It  maybe  that companies that  compete  with  Asian  imports  or that  lose export  sales  in  Asian marketswill  continue  to get  hurt.  Even  so,  I still  think  that the  economy  is much  more  likely, as MikePrell  remarked,  to be  stronger on  the  upside  than  weaker on  the  downside  of the  Greenbookforecast.I also  continue  to be  concerned  that  we  may never  see the effects  of monetary  excessesin output  prices,  but rather that we will  see them  in  asset prices.  At our business  advisorycouncil meeting  about two weeks  ago,  one  of my  relatively new  members came  into  the meetingand indicated that  he now  understood  the role of the Federal  Reserve.  It  was  to  keep people likehimself from  doing foolish  things.  I  asked him to  explain.  He runs  amanufacturing  company.  He  said he was  driving one day and  saw  a big sign  indicating  that theland he was  passing was zoned  for commercial  real  estate  development  and was  for sale.  Hestopped  and  considered  whether he  ought to purchase that land in order to diversify his businessactivities.  On  further reflection  he realized  that he  didn't know  anything  about commercial  real3/31/98estate  development  and  that this really was  a dumb  idea.  So,  he came to our meeting to persuademe to help keep  him  from  doing something  that would  be  really foolish.  We  are hearing  moresuch stories,  and  I would  be interested  in  knowing whether some of you  have heard them  as  well.We  asked our advisory  council  members  and our directors  how the first  quarter feltcompared  to the  first  quarter of last  year and  compared  to all  of 1997.  In  general,  therun-through  simply reflected what  the  Greenbook  is reporting  probably happened.  Results  werenot only  strong but stronger  than anticipated;  indeed, they  far exceeded  expectations.  Peoplesaid  they came  into this  year with  a cautious  view  of the  economic  outlook,  but they now  arerevising  up their expectations  about what  is going  to happen.The  anecdotal  reports  on  labor markets  still  lead me to  believe  that the reportedcompensation  numbers  are  not capturing what  is going on.  First, I don't think  the turnover  ofworkers is being  analyzed  correctly.  In  addition,  there is occurring  what I now think of as  the"dumbing  down"  of the labor  force.  More  and more  employers  are telling  us that  because  of theintroduction  of smarter technology  and  the way  they  are organizing  their operations,  they noware willing to hire at  a given  wage people  who have  lesser skills  than previously.  That  does notget captured  in  any  of the  compensation  numbers that we  receive.To  cite other  signs of labor market  tightness,  in the  several  counties  around Dayton,Ohio,  in  what is called  the  Miami  Valley, there  are currently  550,000  employees.  The  universitythere  did  a survey of job openings  that  added  up  to over 50,000.  That  total  is  10  percent ofcurrent  employment  in  the  area.  I asked  our business contacts  there  how they  were  going to dealwith  this  labor scarcity  problem.  They  indicated  that they are  counting on  migration  from otherparts  of the country.  They  also reported  for the first time  such  developments  as workers  balkingat  voluntary overtime.  Retail  companies  are telling us  that they  are going to mandatory overtime3/31/98because  their workers  are  not  signing up.  What the workers  are signing  up for, faster  than everbefore, is their  vacation  schedules.We are  hearing more  and  more reports  about  real  estate  transactions  that I think arevery questionable.  As probably  everyone  else  is hearing,  our banker contacts  claim that it  is theother lenders that  are  engaging in  such dubious real  estate financing.  All  of their owntransactions  are  very soundly  based  on  appropriate  valuations.  Home  prices  are rising  veryrapidly in  our area.  People  are paying  up for commercial  space.  We  are  getting  anecdotalreports,  scattered  here  and there  around  the  District including  the metropolitan  areas,  about  risingrental  rates  for retail  space  and  other commercial  space.In  another report that  I found interesting,  directors  said  that the  fastest rising wagesthat they see  are teacher  salaries.  State,  local  government,  and  school  district  tax receipts  arecoming  in  very  strong and  they  are  being spent  on  worker compensation.  We  hear bankers, inparticular,  who say that  when  they lose  lower  level  workers  in  their  organizations,  they typicallylose  them to schools  or to city governments.  One  of the  large banks that  operates  in  most of thestates in  our region  said that they came  into the  period expecting  good  commercial  loan demand,and it has been  very strong.  What  has  surprised  them, though,  was  that consumer  loan  demand,which  had previously  tended  to  weaken,  has rebounded  very  sharply.  They  also asserted  thatcredit  quality  standards  definitely have  been  lowered  as  a result of what  they said  is shoddyunderwriting  by syndicators.  Finally, as  an  illustration  of labor market  flexibility, we  saw  areport  that United  Parcel  Service  would be  expanding  greatly its  operations  in Louisville,  in  BillPoole's  District.  A  bank that  has a  significant credit  card  operation in  Louisville  said  that  wasnot a problem for them;  they  were  going to  shut that operation  down  and  move to  some  other3/31/98place where  there  was a bigger pool  of labor.  They were not  going to compete  with  UPS  forworkers.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  Twelfth  District economic  growth  accelerated  in  1997,led by  a surging  California  economy.  We  believe that the District  economy  entered  1998  withconsiderable  momentum.  Recently revised  figures  show that  growth  in  California payrollemployment jumped  to 3.8  percent  in  1997,  about  a percentage point  greater than in  1996  andalso  a percentage  point greater than the  increase  for the nation  as  a whole.  The pickup  occurredin  most  major sectors,  but  not  surprisingly it  was  largest in  the  construction  industry  whereemployment  grew  by over  11  percent.  Furthermore,  we  see  that  all  areas  of the  State ofCalifornia  shared  in  that  surge.  The most pronounced  acceleration  occurred  in SouthernCalifornia, led  by San Diego and  several  counties  that  surround  Los Angeles  County.  Althoughdemographic  factors  held  growth in Los  Angeles  below  that of the  rest of the  state,  the LosAngeles economy did pick up  substantially  in  1997.  Employment  grew  at a solid  rate,unemployment  declined by nearly  1-1/2  percentage  points,  and the  housing market  improvedconsiderably.For the  state  as a whole  in  1998,  a weather-related  pause in  January  employmentgrowth  was  followed  by  strong expansion  in  February, suggesting  that California  remains on  orclose to the path  that we  saw  in  1997.  As the  California  economy  continues  to heat  up, there  aresigns of a shift  in  economic  activity  away  from other  states in  the District.  Employment  andconstruction  indicators  generally  showed  that Nevada,  Arizona,  Oregon,  Utah,  Washington,  andIdaho  all  expanded  less  rapidly in  1997  than  they did in  1996.  Despite  the  gradual  cooling trendoutside  of California, the  District as  a whole  remains  on a  stellar growth  path.3/31/98One  development  that we  are watching  carefully is  the impact of conditions  inSoutheast  Asia,  which  certainly  are  having  a  moderating  effect  on District  export  sales of variousagricultural  and  manufactured  products.  But the  net impact on  employment  growth  in our regionis quite  limited  to date.At the  national  level,  the  economy has  once again  shown  surprising  strength.  Indeed,our monthly  indicators  model  projects first-quarter real  GDP  growth  well  above  the Greenbookestimate.  It is in  the low  4 percent  range.  Some of this  strength  may  be transitory,  perhaps  aresult of unusually  warm  weather.  If that  turns  out  to be  the  case,  then  the  robust  expansion  inthe first  quarter  may  have  little  implication  for the longer-run  outlook  because  it  may be theresult  of some  borrowing  from the  second  quarter.  However,  we  think  it  is more likely  that theconsiderable  momentum  of the  first  quarter will  carry  forward.  The  latest  gains in  disposableincome,  which  should  support  further  purchases  by households,  are  particularly  impressive  inthis  regard.  Thus,  at the  current  funds  rate  and  even  taking  into  account  the fallout  from EastAsia  and  a  slowdown  in  inventory  investment,  we  see  real  GDP  growth  remaining  near potentialthroughout  the  remaining  quarters  of 1998.  Given  our outlook  for real  growth,  there  is littlequestion  that labor markets  will  remain  very  tight this  year.  There  is already  significant  upwardpressure  on  wages  and  salaries,  and  we  see annual  compensation  growth  increasing  severaltenths  this  year  and  again  next year.  However,  as  all  of us  have  noted, the  outlook  for prices  isconsiderably  more favorable  than  that for wages.  With falling  import  prices, lower prices  for oiland  other commodities,  as  well  as  recent productivity  enhancements  and additions  to capacity,core price  inflation  probably  should come in  at  a  rate  of around  2 percent.  This would  certainlyrepresent  further modest progress  toward  our objective  of price  stability.3/31/98Looking beyond  this  year, it  is uncertain  in  my  view whether the  special  factorsmoderating  inflation  will  endure  and  whether  our recent  progress  toward price  stability can  bemaintained.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The pace  of economic  expansion  in  theSeventh  District has  picked up  since  the beginning  of the  year.  Mild winter  weather explainspart,  but  not  all,  of the reported  strengthening  in  retail  sales and  our very  robust housing  market.In  contrast  to the  slowing  seen  in  the nation,  expansion  in  our  manufacturing  sector hasaccelerated.  The March results  of the  Chicago Purchasing  Managers'  survey released  thismorning  show  an  increase in  the  overall  index  from 57.8  in  February to  59.5 in March,  paced  bysharp increases  in  both production  and  new orders.  Consumer  surveys from Detroit  andMilwaukee  had  shown  a pickup  in  the pace  of retail  sales  expansion  in  January and  again  inwhich  may  reflect  the Asian  situation  since we expect  that  other areas  will  be  affected  more  thanour region.Since  our last meeting,  I have  visited  several  areas  of our District.  In  addition,  ouracademic  advisory and  our agriculture,  labor, and  small  business  advisory  councils met  recentlyand  we had  meetings  of our Chicago  and Detroit boards  of directors.  Several  common  themesemerged  from these  meetings:  first, labor markets  remain  very tight;  second, health  insurancecosts are  rising;  and  third,  Asian  developments  have  not yet had much  of an  impact.  Wecontinue to hear about new  ways  that employers are using to  deal  with  tight labor markets.  Forexample,  many  contacts  noted the increased  use  of apprenticeship  programs  in  the constructionindustry.  We were  pleased to  hear that  apprentice  and pre-apprentice  programs for electricians3/31/98and  carpenters  are being  reestablished  in  the  city of Chicago  as  opposed  to the  suburbs.  Theseprograms  draw  on  the  unemployed  in the inner city.  In  Peoria, a  high-tech jobs  training  center isbeing  built and  sponsored jointly by  a local  university,  high  schools,  employers,  and the stateemployment  service.  All  the  sponsors  will  be located  in the  new building in  order to  ensure  thatthe  high-tech  training  reflects  the  needs  of local  employers.  We even  have  heard  that temporaryhelp  firms  are  using temporary  help.  [Laughter]  One labor union  contact  told us a real  first:  Atemporary help firm  solicited  striking workers  on  a  picket  line for temporary  assignmentselsewhere.  [Laughter]In  terms of the  Asian  situation,  most  of our directors  and  council  members  felt that theAsian  impact  on net  exports  would not  be large.  Still,  we  have heard  various  anecdotes  thatindicate  an  Asian impact  on  some types  of exports  and  imports.  Pork  sales to  Asia  are downsignificantly,  and  we are  importing  container board  from  Japan  for the first time in  our contact'smemory.  In  the  auto industry,  some domestic  light  vehicle production  has been  cut  as  a result ofsoftening  export  sales to Asia.  Import  sales  of light  vehicles  have  increased,  although  mostlysales  of European  rather  than Asian models.  Korean imports  have  doubled  their market  share  ofmotor vehicle  sales from  .7 to  1.4 percent.  I  guess  it's not  surprising since  they  are  offering$2,000  rebates on  cars  selling for $12,000.  All  of us have  heard  that  Asian  firms  are havingdifficulty  obtaining  trade  finance,  but  several  auto  industry  contacts  speculate  that the Japaneseauto  firms have  not  increased  exports  to  the United  States  because  of political  considerations.Turning to the  national  outlook, I continue  to  be impressed  by the strength  of thedomestic  economy.  Consumer fundamentals  are strong  and firms  seem  poised to remain  bigspenders  for high-tech  capital  goods  over the next few  quarters.  As  in January,  we expect  netexports  and inventory  investment to  be the  largest  drags on  GDP  growth this  year, though  our3/31/98outlook  for a  depressing  Asian  effect  is  somewhat  less pessimistic  now  than  it  was two  monthsago.  All  told, we  expect  to  see  GDP growth  of about  2-1/2  percent  this  year, with  some  slightpickup  in inflation  over last year's  levels.Last  week  I met  with  eight economists  comprising  our academic  advisory  council.Most  council  members  attributed  measured  inflation's  recent  low levels  to  a variety  of specialfactors.  These include  the dollar's  recent  appreciation  and  the deceleration  of medical  care  costsas well  as  the continued  methodological  changes  implemented  by the BLS.  Every councilmember expects  inflation  to accelerate  noticeably  over the next  12  months, the consequence  oftight  labor markets  and GDP growth  consistently above its trend rate.  The  council was  nearlyunanimous  in its  view that monetary  policy  should  be tightened  over the next  few months.In  summary,  I  remain  concerned  that the domestic  economy's  strength will  outweighany negative  effects  arising  from the  turmoil  in  Asia.  At  our currently  high  resource  utilizationrates,  this strength  threatens  to generate  noticeable  price  pressures  over the forecast  horizon.Although  in  January  1 viewed  the  risks  as  somewhat balanced,  I  now  view the risks  goingforward  as tilted  toward the  upside.

MS.  RIVLIN.  Mike,  excuse me,  but  what were  your academics  saying  a  year  ago?

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Several  were  saying the  opposite a year ago.  It  was much  more of amixed picture,  with  some  saying that we  should be tightening  and others  indicating that  thingswere just fine  and we  should  not  change our policy.  But for the first  time  at the  latest meeting,they were  virtually  unanimous in  the view  that some  tightening  would be  needed.  It was asurprise  to us.

MR.  BOEHNE.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  The economy in  the  Philadelphia Districtis  growing  at the  same  rapid pace  as  last  year.  Job  growth has expanded  to all  sectors  includingmanufacturing,  which  had  been  a drag  on  the  regional  economy.  Labor markets  are  very  tight.Compensation  costs  are rising, but apparently  so is productivity  growth.  There  is little evidenceof rising inflation.As  others have  said, the anecdotal  comments  from the  business  community  revolvemostly around people  issues.  The most  frequently  heard  comment  is that qualified  workers  arescarce  and  they  are becoming  more expensive.  There is more job-hopping  as compensation  isbid up.  One  labor leader  told me  that  the  building trades  are  having trouble attracting  qualifiedworkers  because wages  in  manufacturing have now  surpassed  those  in  construction.For the first time  in several  years,  I also  am  hearing comments  about a  shift  in  thepsychology  of the workplace.  In  the  wake  of corporate  downsizing,  there  was job insecurity  andpeople tended  to work  longer and  harder.  Now  there  is an  emerging  view  among  workers  thatthey cannot keep  up the  pace  any  longer.  It  would  appear that job insecurity  is beginning  to turnthe other way, and  workers  are looking for things  like more vacations  and  more  predictability  intheir work schedules.  If they're  not  getting that from  their current employer,  they can  get  a jobsomewhere  else  with  a significant  increase  in  pay.  In  conjunction with  the tightness in  the  laboruse  of technology  throughout  the economy to  increase productivity.  It  is one  story  after another,and one  gets the sense that the end  is nowhere  in sight,  that we  are in  one  of those periods wherethis process  is likely  to  go on  for some time.Turning  to the national  economy,  it seems that we  are  still being  dealt the same  handthat we have  been  dealt  for a number of months.  We  have ongoing  strength  in  demand  and very3/31/98tight  labor markets  that  by past  standards  should  be  causing inflation  to accelerate,  but thatacceleration  is not  happening.  We  also have  the card  that  points  to some  prospective  slowing  inthe  pace  of demand,  and that  slowing  is not materializing  either.  We  all hear  anecdotally  aboutsignificant  productivity  growth,  but it  is not  being  captured  fully in  the  statistics.  I also  think wehave  the  same hand being dealt  to  us as  far as  policy goes.  That  is a wait-and-see  policy  versussome  kind of preemptive  action.  We will  be talking  about that  later.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  I  would  characterize  the overall  growth  ofour region's  economy  as  moderate,  at least  by our District's standards,  in  that  growth in ourregion  has  fallen back  to  national  trends in  the  last  several  quarters  after leading  the nationthrough  the  early  years  of this expansion.  With  a couple  of notable  exceptions,  I currently seefew  signs of imbalances  in  our regional  economy.Housing  activity continues  to be mixed but  at a  high  level,  with increases  in  sales ofsingle-family  homes offset  to  a  substantial  extent by declines  throughout  the region  in  themultifamily  sector.  We  have  generally  healthy  commercial  real  estate  markets, but to repeat  acomment  that I  made  at  the last  two meetings,  I  continue  to  see  some worrisome  signs  ofspeculative  commercial  development  in  Atlanta.  Planned expansions  in Atlanta  are estimated  tobe  about double  the  current absorption  rate  for the coming  year.  I  would emphasize  that  this realestate  activity  is concentrated  in Atlanta  and  is not  representative  of the region  as  a whole.Nonetheless,  it  is a development  that  I think  I  need  to continue to  watch.Tourism  in our major tourist  centers  is very  strong.  One  measure of just how  strong  isthe  unavailability  of airline  seats on most flights  into Florida, where  hotel  and  cruise shipbookings  are  quite heavy  into the future.3/31/98Like others  on  the  Committee,  I continue  to  look  hard for  signs  that  the Asianproblems  are  affecting  our  regional  economy.  One  piece  of tangible  evidence  shows  up in  ourDistrict's pulp paper  industry.  Two pulp  paper companies  in  Alabama  were  forced  to shut downfor two  weeks.  About  two-thirds  of their hardwood  output and  about  one-half of their softwoodoutput  is sold  to  Asian  customers.  Pulp  obviously is  a volatile  industry and  periodic  shutdownsare not  unusual,  but this  is the  first attributable  to  developments  in  Asia.  Beyond  this,  there  areas  best  I can  tell only fragmentary  reports  so  far that individual  companies  have  been  adverselyaffected.  In  the  aggregate,  the reported  Asian  impact  in  our region  appears  to be  negligible  atthis time.It  is also  becoming  clear that  there  are  both  positive  and negative  impacts  on thedomestic economy  from  Asia.  A  positive  example  comes from  one  of our  directors  who buildsroof  trusses  for houses  and  small  commercial  buildings.  He  reports  that  because  of the very  wetweather, it has been  nearly  impossible  for heavy  equipment  to  get into  southern  forests  to harvestsouthern  yellow  pine, and  the price of such  lumber has increased  significantly.  However, theprice run-up  of pine lumber resulting from  the supply  squeeze has been  muted by the  influx  ofWest Coast  spruce  and  fir.  The drop-off  in  demand from  Asia for that  West Coast  lumber  and  itsdiversion  to our region  has come  with price  cuts  of about  25  percent.Lastly,  as far as  the  region is concerned,  I would  be remiss  if I did not  add  ourperspective  to the current  availability  and  cost of labor.  To  no one's  surprise,  labor markets  inour area  also  remain  tight  and  continue  to press  employers  to  look even  harder for opportunitiesto  substitute  capital  for scarce  labor.  To  add  one more story  of productivity  gains,  on  a swing  Imade through  north  Alabama  two  weeks  ago, who manages  an  agriculturalconglomerate  told me  about  a new piece  of equipment.  The  equipment is  configured  so as  to3/31/98allow  each  pass of the equipment  through the fields  to till or harvest  12  rows instead  of theprevious  10,  a very appreciable  increase  in  productivity, part  of the resultingsavings  was retained  by and part  was  used to  raise the hourly  wages  of the workers  byabout  15  percent.  I continue  to get  similar reports  from  almost every  industry contact  that I talkto.  It is  clear that efforts  to  achieve productivity  gains are  still  meeting with  some  success.As  far as the  national  outlook is concerned,  our judgmental  forecast  is extremely  closeto the  Greenbook's  this time  and similar to others  that already have  been  laid out  around thetable.  I agree  that  the near-term  outlook is  good  to excellent.  Given  this  agreement  on the  nearterm  and  the lack of immediate  policy  action  that it  seems to  suggest, our focus  should continueto be  on the  longer term  over which  many forecasts  have  inflation  rising  after 1999.  Here wemust  acknowledge  that  we  have  tended to over-forecast  inflation  and  under-forecast  growthduring this decade.  Speaking for myself, this is  the  type of error I can  live  with  if it  does not leadus into policy missteps,  which  I think  we  have avoided  so far.  Still,  seeing  the past pattern  offorecast  errors,  I am  concerned  that we  may be  lulled into  discounting  the current  inflationforecast  too much  and  risk waiting too long  before the required  policy move  is  made.I suspect that  many forecasts  implicitly  assume  that  the FOMC  will  behave  as  it  hasin the past, and  if we  do, I think inflation  certainly  should be  expected  to rise.  Our Atlantabaseline model  forecast  explicitly assumes  that  we will  behave  as  in  the past,  and  it indicates  thaton  average  we have  tended to ease  policy when  growth  was  in the  range we  are now  forecastingfor a substantial  period ahead  and  when inflation  was  low and  falling.  The  model  shows  thatlater, but  not much  later, inflation  has tended  to accelerate,  demonstrating  the kind of policymistake  we need to  guard  against.3/31/98I think  this history  cautions  us  to  be leery  of suggestions  that the  recent  low inflation,whatever  the  source,  provides  an  opportunity to  ease  policy.  This  leads  me back  to thinkingabout  how  much  to  discount  the  current  inflation  forecasts,  which  tend to  show  an accelerationseveral  years  down  the road,  something  almost all of us  have  said we  find  unacceptable.  Ourmodel  suggests  that if we stick  to our current policy  position  and do not  repeat  the pattern  ofeasing  when  growth  seems to  be  slowing  and  inflation  to  be declining, then  I think we cancomfortably  discount  the  forecast  of worsening  inflation.  It  is for those  reasons  that  I think  wecan afford  to  wait for a  while  to see if the disruptions  in  the real  economy  do or  do notmaterialize.  Thank  you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  The economy  in the Tenth  FederalReserve  District remains  quite  healthy.  It  appears  to be  growing at  a  faster  rate than  the  nationso  far this  year.  For example,  we estimate  that total  employment  rose  at  an annual  rate of 7percent  in  the first two months  of 1998,  quite a  bit faster than  the  increase  for the nation.  Someof the  surge in  employment was  due to  the warm weather,  which  had  a favorable  effect  onconstruction  activity  in  our region,  but other  sectors  also added jobs  across the District.  LaborAs  in  the  last  several  months,  about  half the  firms we  have  contacted  said that  they wereresponding  to  labor shortages  by raising  wages  more than  normal.District  firms  report that they  continue to  operate  at  very  high levels  of capacity.Manufacturing  remains  strong.  The farm economy  continues to  do well,  although  there  are  somesigns  of weakness  related  to  developments  in  Asia.  For example,  contracts  in the  food industryshow  reduced exports  to  Asia this  year.  District energy  activity  also  has slowed  in  response  to3/31/98the  sharply lower oil prices.  The  District rig  count has fallen  about  20 percent  since  thebeginning  of the  year.  Retail  sales have  been  quite healthy  in  the District, partly due  to goodweather, but  again  the  gains  have  been  broadly based  across  the District.Despite the concerns  about  credit  quality  nationwide,  lending standards  in the Districtas  they  are reported  to  us do not  appear to  have  deteriorated  a great  deal.  At the  same  time, weare beginning  to hear  anecdotal  stories  of some  speculative  activities.  I  will  share just a  couplewith  you.  In  one of the resort areas  in  Colorado--not  Vail  or Aspen  but one  of the  moremodest  resort  areas--condominiums  were  offered  for sale prior to  construction.  The prices  thatwere considered  minimum  in  the bid  process  could not cover  the required  cash  flow even  if thecondominiums  were  rented every  day  of the  year.  Yet,  people  were  standing  in line  to buy oneunit at  a minimum  and  they were  often  going for two.  Another example  relates to the  recentexperience  of a small  investment  firm  with  a  good reputation  that offered  shares in  a  new  fund.They  were trying  to raise  about  one-  half billion  dollars  for investment  purposes.  They  startedthe new fund  in January,  and  when  I  asked  them recently how  they were  doing,  they indicatedthat  so far they  had  been  offered  about $1-1/2  billion  to  invest.  One  of their examples  of investorinterest was that although  they did not want to take  more  than  $20  million from any  one  investor,a  couple of them insisted  on  their taking  at least  $60  million.  So,  some  of the  anecdotal  reportsthat we  are  getting  suggest  a  degree  of optimism  and  speculation  that we  have  not  seen  for sometime  in  our region.More  generally,  our forecasts  relating  to the  broad domestic  economy  are  not unlikeothers.  We  see a  very  strong  economy  and  one  that we  expect will  remain  strong.  Thecontributing  factors  are  the  obvious  ones:  low  interest rates,  high  consumer confidence,  strongincomes  and  employment,  and, of course,  the  stock  market.  We  do expect  some  moderation in3/31/98growth  due  to weakness  in net  exports  and to  inventory corrections  that  might occur.  However,we  think  that the  risks to  the  expansion  are on  the  upside  in  the  context  of improvements  inproductivity  that  may continue on  a more permanent  than  expected  basis  as  a result of persistinghigh  rates  of investment  and  further  improvements  in technology.  But we  also recognize  thatinflation  has  been  held down  by some temporary  factors.  How  temporary is,  of course,  thequestion.  These factors  are  the prices  of food,  oil,  and  imports.  As these favorable  price  trendsunwind,  I think  we're going to see  some fairly  substantial  pressures  toward  increased  inflation,given  our forecast  of an  economy  that remains  very  strong on  the  domestic  front.  Thank  you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  The economy in  New  Englandcontinues  to be  strong.  Actually,  on  the basis of revised benchmark  data,  it is  a little  strongerthan  we thought it  was in  1997  and  early  1998.  Tight labor market  conditions  prevail,  as  dostrong  real  estate  markets  in  most areas,  and  good,  if not  great, prospects  for  the  tourist industryand  investment  management  firms, just to  name two businesses.  Manufacturing  reports  are  a bitmore  mixed.  Some  firms  are  doing quite well  as  a result  of accelerating  demand  for  aircraft  andheavy  truck  parts,  furniture, and equipment.  Others, especially  in  the equipment  and  high-techindustries, are  holding their  own or experiencing  some  difficulties  in  the face of cheaper importsand difficulties  in  their Asian markets.In  general,  the impact  of Asia  seems wider than  at the  time of the  last meeting.  Nearlyall  the  manufacturers  we talk  to either have  felt  some impact so  far from Asia or  expect,  directlyor indirectly,  such  an impact  by midyear.  The nature  of the Asian  impact  can  be both  negativeand  positive, echoing  a little of what President  Guynn  said.  On  the  negative  side, firms  havebeen  affected by the  cancellation  of orders  from  their Asian customers,  and several  have3/31/98associated  layoffs with  this  problem,  including  in one  case  the  closing of an entire  plant.  Inaddition,  some  contacts  have indicated  that they  have  had to  supply  financing to Asian  customersor suppliers  who are  unable to get  credit  through  normal  sources.  On the positive  side, however,many  of our contacts  report that  lower  prices have  led  them  to increase  their purchases  in  Asia,and  they are trying to  move  more manufacturing  to  that region  to  take  advantage  of lowerproduction  costs.  It  will  take  some time  for them  to make  these changes in  cases  where  existingbusiness relationships  are  constrained  by long-term  contracts.As  I noted  before,  labor markets  are  very  tight  and  one  hears  anecdotally  aboutdifficulties  in  hiring beyond  high-tech  employees  who  have been  a problem  for  some time inNew  England.  Even  entry-level  employees,  particularly  in the  hotel  and tourism  industries,  aredifficult  to  find.  At  the Bank,  we  have  begun  to experience  turnover  in  our night check-clearingstaff that  is  making  it difficult  to  absorb  the  increased  processing  that resulted from the  closing ofour RCPC  in  Lewiston,  Maine.  Contacts  tell  us that firms  continue  to pursue  a  number ofstrategies  to cope  with  hiring difficulties.  The  latter include  on-the-job  training to  improveefficiency  and  efforts  to  accommodate  the mix  between job  and family  life  situations,  as well  asselective  increases  in  wages,  benefits,  and  bonus pools.  Even the very  hard to employ  andparticularly  those  who  are targeted  by  the Federal  welfare-to-work  legislation  are  being courtedin  Boston  by such  firms  as  Marriott, which  is  designing  special  training programs  aimed  atmaking  these people employable  and  employed in  the hotel  industry.  This  objective  will  be  veryhard to  achieve,  and  one  can  only hope  that  the effort  will be successful.On the national  scene  we,  like the Greenbook,  have  increased  our estimate  of 1998GDP,  so  we  still  stand a  little  above  the staff forecast.  Our forecast  is based on  the strength  ofemployment,  residential  construction,  consumer  durable  expenditures,  and  business investment3/31/98so  far this year.  We  agree that there will  be  a drag from  Asia  and an  inventory  correction  aswell,  but we  fully expect  that domestic  demand  will  be strong enough  to withstand  these  negativeforces  and  keep the  economy from  slowing much  below  potential  over the  remainder of this  year.We,  like the  Greenbook,  see  1999  growth  about  at  potential,  though we  have been  hesitant  toforecast  a  stock market correction.  Our forecast shows  unemployment  declining  and coreinflation  rising  a bit more  than  in the  Greenbook, but  taken  altogether  that is not  a bad prospect.Where we  are  concerned  is in  the  assessment of the risks.  Mike  Prell  picked  up a littleof that  concern  in his  presentation  as  well.  At  our last meeting,  I and  a lot  of other peoplethought that the risks to the  forecast were  roughly balanced.  I could  see  the  potential  fornegative  as well  as  positive surprises.  Now  it  seems  that the  risks are  more on  the upside  again.Domestic  growth  is  stronger than  expected.  Wage  and  benefit  increases  have crept up by  somemeasures  into the  4  percent range,  particularly  in  services.  There  are selected  price increases  inservice  industries.  Comments  around  the  table  have reflected  on  indications  of more  speculationin real  estate  activity.  This  speculation  is fed by financial  markets,  which are  extremelyaccommodative.  From  every perspective that  we can  see in  our region  and  nationally, monetarypolicy is not  tight;  it is  not even  neutral.  It is  accommodative  to an  increasingly  speculativeenvironment.Sure,  there  are negatives.  We  have  yet to  see the full brunt  of Asian  developments.Inventory  levels  may  correct.  The temporarily  benign  influences  of low  benefit costs,  growingproductivity, increases  in  dollar exchange  rates,  and  declining  oil  prices  may be  about to  shift.  Ithink the question  for today is how long  the  current  situation  can  last before  tighter monetarypolicy is warranted  or,  more specifically,  how  long we  can wait before  we have  waited  too long.

MR.  MCTEER.  After  a  year of exceptionally  strong economic  performance  in  1997and into  1998,  the economy  of the  Dallas  region  has  recently begun  to  show  some signs  ofsoftening,  or at least  expectations  and early  hints of softening.  Lower oil  prices,  the effects  ofthe Asian  crisis, and  continued  labor market tightness  are key  factors  responsible for thespreading expectation  of slower growth.  The  recent  sharp drop  in oil  prices,  which  was partiallyreversed last  week, has  done  a  lot to shake  business  confidence  in  Texas.  As of just over a  weekago,  real  oil  prices  had  slipped  by over  $8  per barrel  since  October  and  were  at their  lowest levelsince  1933.  If that 20  percent reduction  had not  been  reversed,  research  at  the  Dallas  Fedsuggests  that there  would  have  been  long-term  employment  losses of between 1/2  and  1 percent  ofthe  workforces  in Texas,  Louisiana,  and  New  Mexico.  While  this is probably  only about  one-third of the impact that  would  have resulted  from similar oil price  declines  in  the mid-1980s,  itnonetheless  would represent  an  inflection  point  of the District's  growth  trajectory  of recent  years.Combined  with  the  weakness  in  petrochemicals,  semiconductors,  and  agricultural  commoditiesstemming  from reduced  Asian  demand,  the weakness  in  oil  prices  has  the potential  to set  thegrowth  trend in  the Eleventh  District on  a  divergent  path  from  the  nation.Lower  financing  costs  have  added  to the construction  boom  in Texas.  Commercialconstruction  remains  strong and  large new  projects  are  announced  almost daily.  At our smallbusiness  advisory  council  meeting  two weeks  ago,  one of the members  commented  that  severalof his  law firm's clients  have  decided  in  recent  months  to  become real  estate  developers,probably  a  sign  of trouble.  [Laughter]  I don't know  if that included  Jerry  Jordan's guy or not.With  the increased  uncertainty  about  energy prices  and the impact on  growth trends  in  Texas,some  of this  building activity  might be looked  back  on  as  irrational  exuberance  a couple  of yearsfrom now if oil  prices  stabilize around  $14.  We  are  encouraged  somewhat  by  recent reports3/31/98from  Houston  that oil  companies  have begun  to cut  back on  office expansion  plans that  weredeveloped  earlier.  Additional  evidence  on  market  sensitivity  to the  changing  situation  comesfrom anecdotes  that  lenders  in Houston  are becoming  more  conservative  about construction  loansfor speculative  building.Mexico  adds  to  the downside  risks facing the  Texas  economy.  I suppose you  saw the"Salt  and Pepper"  cartoon  in  the Wall  Street  Journal  the  other day that  said,  "You  can  live theAmerican  dream  working  for  a Japanese  company  in Mexico."  So far, the Mexican  economyhas  held up  well,  given  its  reduced  competitiveness  with  Asian  countries  and  its reduced  revenuefrom  oil  production.  We  continue  to get  reports  that Mexican  shoppers  are  back  in  force  inTexas  retail  stores  along the border and  at  upscale  stores  in  Houston  and  San Antonio.  Whetherthis reflects  an  overvalued  currency  or just a strong recovery in  Mexico  is an  open question.My tight  labor market anecdote  of the month  from  the  Eleventh  District is that  acompetitor  of Texas  Instruments  put up  a billboard  across  the freeway  from  the TexasInstruments  headquarters  in  Dallas.  On  the billboard  it  said,  "Why did  the engineer cross theroad?  To get  a better job."  [Laughter]The national  economy  seems  more like two economies  these days,  with  the foreigntrade goods  sector showing  signs  of weakness  while  activity  in the nontrade  goods  sector hasaccelerated  of late.  Price  pressures  remain  subdued,  but the core  CPI  statistics  are  beginning  tobe  a source  of concern.  I  am  not inclined,  however,  to react  to labor market  tightness  as  long asbusinesses continue  to be  innovative  and  creative  in holding  down labor costs  in  the face  of stiffcompetitive  pressures  in  the markets  for goods  and  services.  M2  is growing  too fast  for comfort,but I do take comfort  from market-based  indicators  of monetary  policy,  such as  a  strong dollarand weak  commodity prices, as  well as the prospective  impact of Asia.3/31/98

MR.  BROADDUS.  In  keeping  with most of the  other comments  around  this table--]guess Bob  McTeer's  comments  are  an exception  today--our District economy  seems by  allaccounts  to have  remained very  strong.  There  are  some indications  in  the manufacturing  sectorthat shipments  may be softening  a bit, but orders remain  quite strong.  Like  Jack  Guynn  andsome others,  we  have gotten  occasional  comments  from folks  indicating that the  Asian  situationis having some  negative  impact  in  particular  industries, especially  in the  paperboard  industry.  Amanufacturer  told  us that  paperboard  orders  from  Korea and  Indonesia  recently have  fallensharply,  but  those stories  are the exception  rather than the  rule.  Manufacturing  is very importantin  our region  and  most manufacturers  are quite  optimistic for the  longer term.  In  general,  theyare  expecting  total  shipments,  domestic  plus  exports,  to be higher  and perhaps  significantlyhigher six  months from  now than  they  are now.Elsewhere,  in the  words  of one  of our retail  contacts, consumer  spending is  "goinggreat  guns."  Auto  sales may  be a little  spotty, but  they are higher than  most dealers  had expectedthem to  be not too long ago.  Our housing sector  remains  very  strong,  and  we  hear more  andmore tales  about speculative  building.  We  have had a lot  of anecdotal  reports  on  tight laborabout.  At  our small  business  council  meeting a couple  of weeks  ago, a member  who runs  anemployment  agency  here in Washington  reported that her firm no  longer counsels  prospectiveemployees  on  how to attract prospective  employers.  Rather,  she counsels  "candidate"  employerson how  to attract employees,  especially high-tech  folks  but others  as  well.  She  also told us that$40,000+ salaries  for senior level  executive  secretaries  and  other high  level  administrativepeople  are not  at all  uncommon  in  this market, runs  a small3/31/98manufacturing  company.  He  told  us that  he recently lost  a programmer  who was  making$50,000  for a salary  almost twice  that  level.  He  now  defines  a  "hot job prospect"  as  somebodywho shows  up for  an  interview  and passes  a drug test.  [Laughter]  And he  is  working onintroducing  robot technology  into his  operations!On  the national  economy, we now  have  at least  some  hard evidence  as opposed  topure predictions  that  the  Asian  problem  is  having  some  negative  impact  on  U.S.  net exports.Obviously,  we need to  watch  that  situation  and  give it  weight  in  our deliberations.  But,  as  JackGuynn  and Cathy Minehan  mentioned,  the  Asian situation  has another  side to it.  It  is also  havingeffects  that  are helping  to strengthen  already robust  U.S.  domestic  demand,  helping  to keep  theinflation rate down,  helping  therefore to  keep  real  wages  up,  and also  helping  to keep  U.S.interest rates  down.On  balance,  I think  it's reasonably  clear  that at  least during  the period  since  our lastmeeting, the  strengthening  in  domestic  demand  has  outstripped  whatever  negative impact  is infact  coming from  Asia.  The Greenbook  obviously  has recognized  this with  what in myexperience  is  a fairly  striking  upward revision  from  one meeting  to the  next  in the projectedgrowth of real  GDP for the coming  year.  I  still  think,  and Mike  Prell  said  the staff has this viewas  well,  that  the risk  is on  the upside in  this projection.  I have felt  that all  along  and I feel  it evenmore  strongly now,  especially  with respect to inflation.In  this  regard,  it is  interesting  to  note that  almost  all  of the Greenbook's  projectednoted  already.  This means  that labor markets  are expected  to remain  tight over the forecasthorizon.  It is  a little  surprising to  me that despite this extraordinary job market tightness  andwidespread  expectations  that  health  care costs  are going  to move up,  the  Greenbook  does not3/31/98project  a further increase  in  the  growth  rate  of ECI compensation  for  1998  over  1997.  Unit  laborcosts  in  the projection  do  rise as  a result  of the  weak productivity  growth.  So, we  do get  aprojected  .3 percentage  point increase,  on  a consistently measured  basis,  in  both  the  core CPI andthe  core PCE measures  of inflation.  Obviously,  if compensation  moves  up  more strongly thanthe  staff is expecting,  that  would compound  any upward  push on  prices  emanating from  laborApproaching  the  inflation  risk from  a different  direction,  as  we  all know  M2 growthhas accelerated  sharply  of late.  I am  well  aware  of the tax  and  refund  effects  that  may explainpart  of this strength,  and  I know that M2  velocity  is still  subject to  a lot of uncertainty.  Even so,I think  it would  be a mistake  to overlook  what  might be the  most  straightforward  explanation  ofthis  strong M2 growth,  namely that  domestic  demand is very,  very  strong currently.  Thank  you.

MR.  STERN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Let me start  by commenting  on  three orfour characteristics  of the District  economy,  some  of which  are by now familiar and  someperhaps  less so.  I will  then talk  a little  about the national  economy.With  regard  to the  District, nearly  all  sectors of the  regional economy  remain  verystrong.  For example,  District employment  is  up  about 3-1/2  percent  from early  1997  to  early  1998.In  Minnesota  it is up over 4  percent.  What  is  really  remarkable,  if not  startling,  about thosenumbers  is  where  the new  workers  are coming  from.  We  do  not exactly  get Sunbelt immigrationrates  in  our District!  [Laughter]  It is a very impressive  performance.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Are  you  going to  answer that question?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I think part of the explanation  is  that people are taking  second  and eventhird jobs.  I wasn't going  to get into  the anecdotal  competition  on  this.  [Laughter]  We  do hear3/31/98stories  about  places  like  Mall  of America that  are  sufficiently  desperate  that  they will  hire  aworker,  if they  can  find  one, who  for whatever  reason  is willing  to work  only  from 4:00 in  theafternoon  until  8:00  in  the evening  three  days  a  week.  These  are people  who obviously  are  doingother things  much  of the  time.  We hear  that some  of them may be  in the  process  of taking  theirthird job.On the  other hand,  we  are  seeing  something  that we have  not  observed  since  probablythe mid-1980s.  I don't want  to  exaggerate  this,  but  we  see  some  indications  that  a  two-tiereconomy  is  developing  where the  urban  areas  are  doing better  than  the  rural  areas.  The  principalproblem in the rural  areas  is agriculture.  There  it  is partially  a question  of  commodity prices--and  Asia may be  having  some effect--and  partially  a  question  of growing conditions,  which rightnow are  not terribly  favorable.  Having  said  that, there is always  a  problem  with  everygeneralization,  and  the  energy  sector,  which  is  of course  rural,  and the  iron  ore  industry,  which  isalso  rural,  are  both  doing  very well  at  the moment.The  third  and  final  regional  characteristic  I  want to comment on  relates to  shortages.  Iwill  not comment  further  about  the labor  situation,  but  there is a  related  shortage  of housing,particularly  in those  rural  areas  where  employment  has  gone up.  In the  metropolitan  areas,  Ithink  housing construction  has  been  sufficiently  strong  to more or less keep  up with  housingdemand.  There has  been  a shortage  of office  space,  but  that is in  the process  of being  alleviatedand  it probably  will  disappear in  the next  several  years.  There  are  now five significant  officeprojects  under way  in downtown  Minneapolis  and  at  least two in  downtown  St. Paul.Developers  report  uniformly  that they  have  no problem  finding financing.As far  as  the national  economy is concerned,  overall  I must say conditions  look  verygood  to me.  Real  growth,  both current  and  prospective,  seems  secure,  and  I believe inflation  will3/31/98remain  low  at least  for some time.  If I wanted  to worry,  I think  I would  worry about  thefollowing  things,  especially  in  the context  of the  Greenbook  forecast.  One  is that  the Greenbookseems to  have  a very favorable  nominal  wage  adjustment  in the  face of very tight  labor  marketconditions.  I worry  a little  about  whether we  really  ought to expect  that to  happen.  I also worryabout  the role of  a stock price decline  in  that forecast.  I do  not have  a conviction  about  stockprices,  and  I would  not  premise a forecast  on it.  I guess,  like Larry Promisel,  I'm not quite  asnegative  as the  Greenbook  about  the foreign  trade  situation,  at least  longer term.  I must admitthat  growth  in M2 is  starting to concern  me a little.In my view,  the  kicker here  is productivity.  I don't want  to get  caught up  in  how  wemeasure  productivity, but  all  of those adverse  factors  can  be offset if productivity  is on  afundamentally  more  favorable trend.  Certainly,  business  people  have asserted  for a long  timethat it  is and they  continue to  do so.  They also  continue  to  indicate  that  it  is  very hard  to makeprice increases  stick.  Indeed,  a more favorable  underlying  or fundamental  trend of productivitywould help to rationalize  stock prices.  I think  I will  stop there.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  As in most of the  rest of the  country,  conditions  in  the EighthDistrict  are strong  and  labor markets  are very  tight.  The unemployment  rate  in the EighthDistrict  is actually  a bit below  the national  average.  Rather  than repeat the  kinds  of anecdotes  wehave  heard before along those  lines, I would like to emphasize  my interpretation  of the  Asiansituation  because I  think we  are all  searching  for that as  the key to  understanding  where  we  are.3/31/98In  my view  there  are  three  analytically  distinct  effects  on  the  U.S. economy  that  flowfrom Asia.  One  is the  trade  effect.  If we  search,  we  find firms  and  industries that  are  impactedby reduced  Asian  demand for U.S.  goods.  In  the  Eighth District,  we  see this  in  food processing,including  chickens.  I  was  surprised  to discover  how  high a  fraction  of District  food exports  go toAsia.Secondly,  after the  summer,  as  the  impacts  of Asian  developments  and  theappreciation  of those  impacts  grew,  we obviously  had  declining  interest  rates.  I think  that  cameabout  for two reasons:  one,  safe-haven  money came  to the United States;  secondly, thereemerged  a view  in  U.S.  markets  that the  Asian impacts  would  slow  the economy  and that  theodds  on  monetary  policy  becoming  easier or tighter  had  changed.  That  was  an  indirect  effectfrom  Asia.  I  suspect  that the  second  reason  relating  to  the  outlook  for monetary  policy  was  muchmore important  than  the  safe-haven  money  that came  here.  Obviously, the  lower  interest ratesare  unambiguously  expansionary  for the  U.S.  economy.The  third  analytically  distinct  impact  is  lower  oil prices  that  have  come  about  from theThe  firms and  the regions  that specialize  in oil  production  are obviously  impacted negatively,  butthe  overall  impact  is positive  because  we have  a lot  of oil  consumers  who  are  benefiting.My  overall  assessment  is  that Asia is  primarily  a relative  demand  shock  rather than  anaggregate  demand  shock for  the United  States.  We have  shifts in  the mix  of demands  in the U.S.economy.  I  believe  we  need to  appreciate  especially  that  the particular  impacts  we  see in  thetrade  account  and  in the  oil  regions  are  easy to spot.  That  is,  they involve particular  firms,whereas  the  generalized  effects  on consumers  that come from  lower  interest  rates  and lower oil3/31/98prices  are  much  more  diffuse.  I  think they  are  much  more important  but easier to miss preciselybecause they  are  so widespread.Overall,  it  seems to  me that slower U.S.  growth  than that seen  in recent  quarters  islikely  but primarily  because  of resource  constraints.  Economic  activity is bumping  along,  itseems to me,  above  and  beyond  capacity.  I do not  see  slower growth  in  aggregate  demandbecause  I  believe  the underpinnings  for further  growth in  aggregate  demand  are  very  strong.There  are many  signs of booming  demand.  The  ones  that impress me  are  the  recent  rapid  growthof income,  output,  and  consumer  demand  that  is fed by  rising asset prices  everywhere  onelooks--equities,  bonds,  real  estate--and  high and rising money  growth,  however  defined.  This  isnot an  issue of exactly what  monetary  aggregate  is one's favorite  since all  of the Ms  are  givingthe same  kind of picture.  We  also  have  tight  labor markets  and wage  pressures.  In  sum,  I don'tsee  anything  in  current  economic  conditions  that  suggests  significant negatives  in our outlook.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I  think  the  FOMC is in  a difficult  spot though  I  don't  expect  we willget much  sympathy.  [Laughter]  Our  difficulties,  as  Bill  Poole just  pointed  out,  stem  not becauseanything  bad is  happening  but precisely  because  so little  bad is happening.  The  economy  isperforming  as well  as it  ever has  and  probably  as well  as any  economy ever  has,  which  is a mindboggling thought.  People  are  producing  and  consuming  and  working  and  investing at higherlevels than  anywhere  before.  Better  than  that, the  economy's  adjustment  mechanisms  seem  to  beworking better than  they ever  have,  here  or elsewhere.  Capacity has  expanded  and modernizedat the  same  time.  Companies  have  learned  how to  manage inventories.  Labor markets  seem tobe functioning  well  in  moving people to  where they  are  needed most.  Shortages,  bottlenecks,strikes--imbalances  that characterized  boom periods  in  the past--do  not seem evident,  although3/31/98we  all  have  been  looking  hard  to find  some  of these  imbalances.  Even  world events  aresupporting  the  good performance  of the  U.S.  economy.  That  is especially  true, again  as  BillPoole just pointed  out, with respect  to the price  of oil.  The latter seems  to have  fallen  far enoughto  help  our oil-consuming  industries,  which  are  most of our industries, without  hurting ouroil-producing  sector  so  much  as  to create  widespread  problems,  although  Bob  McTeer haspointed to  some problems.  It is hard  to find  any villains  in  this piece  when  one looks  at the usualsuspects.  Even  politicians  seem to be behaving  reasonably  well.Some reports  around this  table, quite  a  few actually,  point  to  speculative building.  Wehave  not  yet had  an  evident boom  in nonresidential  construction,  although  we may.  There  are  alot of reports  of labor shortages  but  also considerable  evidence  that the response  has  beenflexible,  targeted compensation  increases  coupled  with  cost-cutting  in nonlabor  areas.  There  alsoare reports  that companies  are  leaving jobs  unfilled  or even  expanding in  different  locationsrather than  bidding  wages  up.  Only  the  stock market  seems  out of line,  and there  is  someevidence  even there  that investors  are  responding  sensibly  to earnings  declines  in particularstocks.  The  view  that equities  are  a  good long-run  investment  might  indicate that  investorswould not  panic in  the  event of a  significant  stock market  correction.  All  of this  makespolicymaking  quite  hard  for us.Our job is  to keep  the  good  news  flowing,  and we  are quite  sure that the  economycannot  expand much  longer at its  current pace  without  running out  of workers  and  setting off aprocess of labor cost increases  followed by price increases.  So,  we would like  to take  out someinsurance  by slowing things  down  a tad.  But  it is  not clear that we have  a policy  instrument  thatwill  do that.  The real federal  funds rate is already  quite high;  raising it  a notch  or two might notraise  long rates  for  some of the reasons that  have been  mentioned.  It might  not have much  of an3/31/98effect.  Conversely,  there  may be  some danger that  an  increase would be  seen  as too  strong asignal,  especially  to the  stock  market,  and  might induce  some  panic  selling  since we  have  notsignaled  that  we were  about to do  anything  like that.  I lean  to  the notion  that it  probably  wouldnot have  much  effect,  but  there's no way to guarantee  that outcome.By May,  we  might be either more  or less worried  about overheating.  If, as the  staffprojects,  the expansion  slows  because  of the Asian  effects  and  for other reasons,  the prospects  ofoverheating  might  seem  less  serious.  But the risk that  it  will  not  slow  and  that labor costpressures will  be building  even  more is certainly  there  and  has been  voiced  around  this table.The good  news,  it  seems  to me,  is that  there is  almost no evidence  that  we  could  get surprised  bya rapid  spurt  of inflation.  If anything  seems clear  about  the economy,  it is  that its  adjustmentmechanisms  are  well  oiled  at the moment  so that we  are  unlikely to be  surprised  by  suddenlurches.  That  is comforting  if we  decide  to  do nothing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  I  want to focus  on  three  aspects  ofcontinuity  in the developments  since  the  last meeting.  First, there  has been  continuedexceptional  momentum  in  private  domestic  demand  and  payroll  employment, only partiallyoffset by a  decline  in  net  exports.  Second,  the  strength  in domestic  demand  has continued  to besupported  by very  favorable  financial  conditions,  including  soaring  equity prices.  Third,favorable  supply  shocks,  reinforced  in  this case by  a  sharper-than-expected  decline  in  oil  prices,have  continued to restrain  inflation.I  continue  to accord  an  important role,  indeed  a  central  role, to favorable  supplyshocks  in  explaining  recent  economic  performance  and  assessing  an  appropriate  course  formonetary  policy.  When there  is  an  adverse  supply shock,  it is well  appreciated  that the  bad news3/31/98cannot  be escaped,  only shared  in the  near term  between  higher unemployment  and  higherinflation.  And  so it is with  a favorable  supply shock,  only substituting  good  news for bad  news.Policymakers  cannot  escape the  benefits no matter how  they might try.  [Laughter]  They canonly  influence how  the benefits  are  shared between  lower unemployment  and  lower  inflation.There is,  of course,  much  to like in  the  outcome  of low unemployment  and  lowinflation  and  in the  policy that  has  supported  that outcome,  so far at  least.  In  particular,  it  is notimprudent  to  operate for  a while beyond  the  point  of long-run  sustainable  capacity  as part of thesharing  of the  benefits  of the  supply shock.  Still,  the  optimal  course  of policy  in this casedepends  on  the expected  persistence  of the shock, although  the length  of time it persists issometimes  as much  of a surprise  as  the  shock  itself.  At any  rate, the  longer-than-expectedpersistence  or renewal  of the  favorable  supply shocks has  certainly  contributed to the veryfavorable  outcome  and to how  brilliant  monetary  policy appears  after the  fact.  The  danger in thispolicy is the  possibility  of misperceiving  the  sustainability  of the  recent  performance  andtherefore  of failing to  appreciate  the necessity  of a transition  at some point  to a more  sustainablestate.  Given  the  transition  that must ultimately  be  made, it might  be  unwise  to move  still  furtherbeyond  the point of sustainable  capacity.The key  to the  Greenbook  forecast  is the  projected  slowdown  immediately  ahead  inthe rate  of economic expansion  to below  trend  growth.  The Greenbook  forecast  shares  thisfeature  with  almost all  private  sector forecasts.  This is  worrisome because  my experience  as  aforecaster  suggests that  forecasters  can  get  it  all  wrong, but they almost never  get it all right.  Atany  rate,  I have  described  this  widely  shared forecast  as  tracing out a graceful  reverse  softlanding.  Because the economy  slows almost  immediately to below trend  growth, it movesgradually  from  its initial  point beyond  sustainable capacity  toward  sustainable  capacity just as3/31/98the favorable  supply  shocks  that  are restraining  inflation dissipate.  The  result is an  economy  thatglides  toward  full  employment  with  still  low  inflation  as  we reach  the  end  of the  Greenbookforecast  horizon.  This  is a  remarkably  favorable  outcome,  especially  since it  occurs  while  weplay spectator.The risks,  however,  seem  weighted  from  my perspective  to stronger  growth  and  hencehigher average  utilization  rates and,  given  the projected  slowdown,  to  even  sharper  increases  incompensation  and inflation  than  in the Greenbook  forecast.  There  is  still a potential  for furthertakes  hold.  There is  also the  potential  that the crosscurrents  so clearly  identified  in theGreenbook  may  work out a little  less  favorably  for price inflation,  exert  somewhat more pressureon  nominal wage  changes,  and produce  a  somewhat  sharper reversal  in  benefit  costs.  The latterdevelopments,  interacting  with  a  slowdown  in  productivity  growth,  suggest  the potential  for aless  benign  than  projected  path  of labor costs  in coming  quarters.  Looking to  1999,  I also  amconcerned  that there  might be  a somewhat  sharper reversal  in the  supply shocks  than  projectedby the  staff.Financial  conditions  in  general  and  monetary  policy in particular  have  playedimportant  roles  in supporting  recent  economic  performance.  Favorable  financial  conditions  havebeen  supporting  aggregate  demand,  notwithstanding  the  sharp rise in  the real  federal  funds  ratestemming from the  decline in  inflation.  Real  long-term  rates  are  steady to declining,  equityprices  are  soaring, credit  availability  is  ample, underwriting  standards  may  have  easedsomewhat,  loan  pricing  is aggressive,  and  money growth  is rapid.  True,  there  is  good reason  toproject a  decline  in  velocity in the first quarter,  and  there  are  some  special  factors  that  likely haveboosted M2  growth.  Still,  there is a  fairly  clear signal  in  the  acceleration  of money growth  that3/31/98should  not be  ignored.  Financial  conditions  in  general  and monetary  policy  in particular  clearlyare not  restraining  aggregate  demand.  The projected  slowdown  in  M2  growth  in the forecast  isonly the  mirror image of the  projected  slowdown  in  nominal  income  growth, reinforced  by  areturn  to a more  stable velocity  path.  This  simply indicates  that if the Asian  slump  slows  theeconomic  expansion  to  the  degree  projected,  the  current  setting of the  funds  rate is consistentwith the  slowing  of nominal  income  growth  and hence  money  growth.  Policy  does not  slowmoney  growth  in  the  forecast;  Asia  does.The bottom  line is that a  slowing in  growth is essential  to  avoid  a  sharper  thandesirable reversal  of inflation  fortunes  in  1999  and  beyond.  The Asian  slump may accomplishthis.  Some patience  has been  advisable  early in  1998  as  we wait  for evidence  on the  degree  ofmomentum  in domestic  demand  and the  offset  from  Asia.  Patience  is a  virtue  but only  to a  point.We  may be  able to  remain  spectators if economic  growth  slows and helps  to preserve  the lowinflation  environment.  But the continued  momentum  in  demand  so  far this  year suggests  that  atighter monetary  policy  may still  be required  to  slow  the  expansion  and preserve  the  lowinflation  climate.

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  This  is my  fourth  meeting.  At theprevious  three,  I  felt rather  confident  in  my advice,  and  I'm afraid  I am  now joining  the cold feetcrowd.  Let me first make  a  few  comments  on  the  Greenbook forecast  and  then a few  on  policystrategy.On  the Greenbook,  there is a big  change  in  the forecast  from  last  time that  many ofyou  have noted.  A  second comment  is that  at least  one  of the projected  sources of the slowdownis  and has been  questionable  to me.  I think  that  if any  of us  really knew  what  we were  talking3/31/98about with  regard to  stock market  values,  we would  not be  here.  We  would be doing  somethingelse.  I  have  always  been  troubled  by the forecast  of a stock market  decline  in  the  sense  that  thestock  market traders  know  everything that we  know.  They  presumably  know about  the earningsforecasts.  So, I  have  been  troubled  by  the  assumption  that in  effect  we can  see  something thatthey  cannot  see.  Mike Prell  has  conveniently done  an  alternative forecast  that does not  assume  astock  market  decline.  In  that forecast,  growth  in  real  GDP  does not moderate  to  a  pace below  thetrend rate  of long-run  economic  growth.  It  gets  down  to  about trend  or maybe  even  a  bit aboveit,  so  part of the slowdown  in  the  staff's  baseline  forecast is  based on  the  assumption  of a  stockratios to interest  rates,  those ratios  do  not necessarily  look out of line.  So, the market  declinesource  of the  slowdown  seems  a little  shaky  to me.The  third point  I  would  make  about the forecast,  and  a  lot  of you  brought  this out  withyour  questions,  is that even  core inflation is not really  "core."  There  are  already  a lot  of positivesupply  shocks  in that measure.  Inflation  could  be heating  up  a  little even  as  we  speak,  thoughthat is not apparent  if we just look  at the  CPI excluding  food  and energy.I  also want to make  a few  comments  about  policy strategy.  Actually,  Larry Meyermade the first when  he talked  about the reaction  to good  news.  The point  is that while  it is greatto have  low unemployment,  we  cannot  overemphasize  it  in relation  to inflation.  We have  to bevery  careful  that we  know  what  we  are doing.  Other than  that, Larry  said  it  very  well  and  I  willnot repeat his  comments.A second  point  on policy  strategy  is that I  am among  those who  think that we  canoperate  on the  basis  of a  federal  funds  rate  target.  But the  point of that target is that we havetried  to work out,  or others  have  tried  to work  out,  the way  the federal  funds  rate replicates  or3/31/98would  respond  to economic  events  had  we been  following  a money standard.  It  is as if we  arefollowing  a money growth  standard,  but we  are  somehow  putting  aside  all  the supply shocks  orthe  velocity shocks  that give us  so  much  trouble  in  interpreting  the  monetary  aggregates.  I thinkit is perfectly  possible  to operate  with such  a modified money growth  standard,  but  we shouldremember that  if we  do  so, the  federal  funds  rate  will  bounce  around.  The  risk in  following  afunds rate target  is that  we can  get  a target  that is too rigid,  and  we ought  to keep that  in mind aswell.The  third policy  strategy comment  is about  lags.  Economic  conditions  are  great  now.As Alice  Rivlin  says,  we may be  seeing the best  performance  of an  economy  ever.  I am notenough  of a historian  to know  about  that, but  it certainly  is  as  good  as  I can  remember.  As welook  around the  world,  we see that we  are  uniquely  blessed,  but we  do  have to look  ahead.  Wehave  known  that there  are  lags in  monetary policy and  we should  not be  conducting  policy  on thebasis  of what  we  see  out  the  side  door as  we drive  but on  the basis  of what  we  see  ahead.  As  Ilook ahead,  I must say that  the  inflation risks  are  beginning to get  a little more threatening  andthe  aggregate  demand  risks from  Asia  are beginning to  get  a little less  threatening.The last point  I would  like to make relates  to  something  that to my surprise  nobodyhas  mentioned  in  all  the meetings  I have  attended.  I get a  periodical  on my  desk called  FedWatch.  Probably  all  of you  get it.  Every  time some new  statistics  come  out, Fed Watch  says  theFed is  going to  have  heart palpitations  about this new  set of numbers,  but  it will  not  do anythingat this  meeting or at its  May meeting.  I am reluctant  to be  that  predictable.  [Laughter]

MR.  FERGUSON.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  During the coffee break,  PresidentBoehne  suggested  that he  had relatively  little to  say this  time around  because  he had such  a  short3/31/98distance to travel.  My  office is  the nearest  to  this room,  short  of the Chairman's,  so I  will  haveeven  less to  say this  time.Let  me observe,  as others  have,  that during  the  first quarter the  spillover  from theAsian crisis  was indeed  overshadowed  by the  strength  of domestic  demand.  Labor markets  haveremained  tight, as  many  of you have  indicated.  One  thing I  would  add  that we  have notdiscussed  much  is  that while  short-term interest  rates  have  risen  to relatively  high  levels  byhistorical  standards,  this  de facto policy  tightening is not  associated  with  similar tightness  at thelonger  end  of the  yield  spectrum.  Risk  spreads  for private debt  instruments  are  quite narrow,  andthe  extension  of credit  to  private nonfinancial  borrowers  from numerous  sources--commercialpaper, bank  lending,  and  so on--is  running  well  above  the pace  of the last  couple  of years.  So, Ithink  we are  in  a  very  stimulative  environment  from a monetary  and  financial  standpoint.The  second  thing  I would  add  relates  to Asia.  We  already  have  talked  about  how littleimpact  we have  seen  from developments  in  Asia.  I  have just returned  from  a  trip to  Japan  duringwhich  I  met  with  central  bankers  and  finance  ministers  from the affected  countries.  Two  thingsemerged  from those  meetings  that  I would like  to bring  to  your  attention.  One  is  that both  theKoreans  and  the Thais  certainly feel  that  their economies  are on  the road to  recovery,  but theydescribe  their  recoveries  as  "U" shaped,  and  they  expect  their economies to  bounce along  thebottom  for an  extended  period before  they  finally see some  uptick.  Secondly,  the  majoreconomy in  the region,  Japan,  is  still  facing  significant  challenges.  During  my visit, I  founduniversal  agreement  that  the economy was  at  least  stagnant and  probably  in  a recession.  Thefiscal  stimulus  packages  introduced  to date,  the latest one  totaling  16 trillion  yen,  are  thought tobe  far less  stimulative  than they might  appear.  As one newspaper  indicated,  the most recent3/31/98package  is "big,  vague,  and  unconvincing."  Therefore,  I  think  that the United  States  is still  likelyto  be the  importer of last resort  and that  more  impact is yet  to be  felt  from  Asia.To  summarize these  brief comments,  what risks do I  see?  I  believe,  as  do a  number ofothers, that  there  is  an increasing inflation  risk  emanating  from  labor  market  tightness, from  thepotential  ending of some of the  special  factors  that  have restrained  inflation  recently, and  fromthe  stimulus that  is  emerging  from  financial  markets.  I  still  see a possibility  of some  greater-than-desired  drag  from  Asia,  but I  think  that risk is  less  now  than it  was  at  the time  of our lastmeeting.  Overall,  I  believe  we  should  be  in a  vigilant  posture, recognizing  that the risks nowseem  to be tilted  toward  the upside.  I  do  see some  dangers in  a  premature change  in  policystance that might be  too  great  or that  would  take markets  by  surprise.  Unlike  my colleague  to theright,  I  think  predictability  is  sometimes  not  a bad thing.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  the  Second  District  is doing  sowell  that  I  will not  spend  any time  commenting  on  it.  We have  reached  a point  of prosperity inNew York  City that has  led the Mayor to decide that  we  should now  spend  most  of our timebeing  nice to one  another.On  the  national  level,  what  do we  know now  that  we  did not  know  at  the last meeting?There  have  been  some  changes.  From  everything we  have  heard this  morning, the  Asian  effecton  the  American  economy is  going to be  less  or at  least  later than  we  thought it  might  be at  thelast  meeting.  I  was particularly  impressed  by the  fact that California,  the place  that  one  wouldthink  is most  vulnerable to  a  negative  Asian  shock,  seems to  be doing  extremely  well.  Consumerdemand  is even  stronger  than we anticipated.  We  have had yet  another positive  supply  shockcoming from  lower  oil prices.  The labor markets  are  tight and may be  even  tighter than they3/31/98were  at the  time of the  last  meeting, and  there  is much  anecdotal  discussion  of some  upcreep  incompensation.  The  equity  markets  are overpriced  in  my view,  but  the  strong flow  into equitymutual  funds,  which  was  very substantial  in February  and  appears  to have been  very  strong inOne  very  positive effect  of tight  labor markets,  and  one  about  which  we  shouldrejoice,  is that people  who normally  do  not get  hired are  getting jobs in these markets  eventhough they  may have to  be trained  before they are  able to do these jobs.  That  experienceprepares  them better for the  labor markets  of the future  and  not just for their current jobs.However, the  duration  of these jobs is particularly  vulnerable  to the policy  actions  that may beneeded  to correct  an  overheated  economy.  So,  if we  are interested  in  sustaining  that  verypositive  aspect  of our job  markets,  we have  to be especially  vigilant and  not  allow  the economyto  overheat.On  the other  side, I think  the problems  in  Asia  are in  no way  solved.  Yes,  theeconomies  of Thailand  and  South  Korea  probably  have bottomed  out,  are bouncing  along  thebottom,  and the  policy mix  in  those countries  is  much  better.  Indonesia's  problems  certainly arein  no way  resolved.  JapanA continuing  weak  Japanese  economyhas  an  adverse effect on  the world  economy.  Also, the persistence  of such  an  economy  would  bevery likely to bring to an  end the relatively  calm world  trade  environment.  We  in  the  UnitedStates  are  very  good  at grumbling  and  complaining and  screaming,  but we don't do  a whole  lotabout it.  Europeans  are  much better at reacting  and,  for better or for  worse,  they definitely  react.It is highly likely  in my view  that if Japan  continues  to follow  its present  policy of allowing nogrowth  or a recession,  thereby  providing a very  weak market for other  nations'  exports  and3/31/98fostering  a very  great desire  to export  themselves,  we are  likely to have  a  serious trade  conflictbetween  Japan  and Europe.  That  would not  affect  the world  economy in  any  positive way!Since the  last meeting,  I think  we  have  had  a modest shift  in the risks to  the economyfrom balanced  to  somewhat  on  the high  side.  In my view, the positive  supply  shocks that  wehave  enjoyed  are  sufficiently likely to  continue  that, for the present, we  can  afford the luxury  ofsome  additional  waiting.  But  this  is not  a situation  in  which  the  guardian  waiting in  the night  canallow  himself to  be  lulled into sleep.  Rather, the guardian  should  be even  more  alert.  It  seems tome  that there  has  been  enough  of a shift in  the  risks toward  the  upside  that we have  to be  verycareful  of becoming  overconfident  about our ability  to  analyze  current problems  and relying  toomuch on  the  continuation  of positive  supply shocks  and in  fact waiting  too long.

MR.  KELLEY.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  We  are reaching  the  time of the  day  whenall  has  been  said.  Between  the  briefings  and the excellent  comments  that  we have  heard aroundthe table this morning,  I think we have  a good  understanding  of where  the economy  is  and whatthe  issues  are,  and I'm not  going to repeat  all  of that.  Let  me just add  that I see very  little, if any,evidence  that this  expansion  is slowing  now  or likely to  slow  very much.  It seems  to have  atremendous  amount  of momentum.  Consumer confidence  is sky  high.  Employment  conditionsare superb.  Personal  income  and  the wealth  effect  are very  strong.  The cost  and  availability  ofcredit are  attractive.  Inflation  fears  seem to  be  diminishing.  It seems  likely  to  me that  it wouldtake a very  substantial  shock to slow this economic  expansion  down  very  much,  let alone bringto  an end this  era of very  strong  and  attractive  economic  growth.We have focused  on  two potential  shocks to  the  economy that  are an  important  key tothe  outlook--Asia  and  the stock market.  In the case  of Asia, I have  no  doubt that we will  get  a3/31/98We have  focused  on two potential  shocks  to the  economy that are  an  important  key tothe outlook--Asia  and the  stock  market.  In  the  case of Asia, I  have no doubt that  we  will  get  atrade shock.  As  Vice  Chairman McDonough  just said,  it  now  appears  that we  will  avoid  theworst  of the  impacts  that  we  saw  as possibilities just  a few months  ago.  I had been  thinking untilquite recently that our forecasts  that  the  Asian  impact was  going to be  "just right"  were  probablyreasonably  accurate,  but I  am beginning  to lean  to  the view  that the Asian impact  may  turn  out tobe somewhat  less than  "just right."  1 appreciated  Bill  Poole's  comments  to that effect  a littleearlier, if I understood him  correctly.In  the  case of the stock  market, I  have no  doubt that  sentiment  is going to  changesome day.  I  remember that after  a brilliant period  for investors  in the  1960s,  we experiencedwhat  amounted  to  a  14-year  bear market  starting  in  1968  and  lasting  until  1982.  I  am notpredicting  that  outcome,  but  some day  the euphoria  we  are  witnessing now  will  change.  Thechange  may occur today, next  month,  next year--who  knows.  However, left to its  own  devices,there  is  a great  deal  of momentum  in  the stock  market  also.  Serious  weakness  that  could  have  amaterial  impact  on  macroeconomic  performance  could  be a long time off.In  short, I  agree  with  others who  have said  over the course  of the morning that  therisks now  clearly  appear to be to  the upside.  In  my view  a  move  to tighten  is  becomingincreasingly  advisable,  although  I  do  not think the case  for such  a  move  is compelling  today.  Iwould  agree  with  the comments  of President  Minehan  a little  earlier that  our job now  may be toconsider carefully  the timing  of a  policy move that we  increasingly  are seeing  as necessary.Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.3/31/98

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  The expansion  is now entering  its  eighthyear.  The situation  is starting to  feel  a bit  surreal,  perhaps  even  unbelievable.  Every  facet  of theU.S.  economy  is surprisingly  strong.  GDP output  continues  to expand  briskly.  Housing activityis up.  The labor market  remains extremely  tight, yet employers  have managed to contain  costsby productivity  improvements,  capital  investments,  and  creative  labor-management  approaches.Throughout this  process,  capacity  actually  has expanded.  To date  inflation  generally  has  beencontained,  although  I would  note that the  spread  between  core  commodities  inflation  andservices  inflation  does remain.  The oil  price  downturn  is bad  for some,  but for others  and in  theaggregate  it is helping  to  control  costs.Financial  markets  have been  supportive  of expansion.  Stock markets,  bond  markets,and all  forms  of short-term  financing including  bank  financing generally  are  available.  Thestock  market may be  too good  to be true,  and  I must say that this  is the first time that  I have  feltreally  uncomfortable about  the market.  The monetary  aggregates  also  are  indicating  stronggrowth.  I recognize  that some  of the  growth  in  the  aggregates  may be the  result  of temporaryfactors  and  more  generally  may just be reflective  of contemporaneous  economic  growth.  Evenso, the monetary  aggregates  are  pointing  to significant  strength.So  far, the Asian crisis  has  on  balance  been  more positive  for the United States  thannegative.  Indeed,  the rest of the  world seems  to be  relying on  the United  States as  the engine  toget  their economies  going.I keep  thinking that something  has  to  give.  The  rate of economic  growth in  1997  andthe apparent  rate of growth  that we  are  experiencing in  the  first quarter are  not sustainable.  Butwhere  is  the slowdown  going  to come from?  If we  started  to see  a deterioration  in  profits,  thatprobably  would be  an indication  that firms  are  no longer able  to  offset their increasing  labor3/31/98costs.  That in  turn would  surely trigger  a stock market  downturn,  and we  would  start  to  see adiminishing wealth  effect.  Inflation  could heat up,  although  I think that is a bit more unlikely  inview  of the  absence of much pressure  worldwide  on  commodity prices.  But inflation  could  stillheat up  and  that would  cause a deterioration  in  aggregate demand.  Again,  as  I said, I think  that  isfairly unlikely.The Asian  crisis could  turn  more  negative.  Indeed, although  conditions  seem  to havestabilized  in  Thailand  and  Korea, it  is  hard  to know whether  or not  some of the long-termchanges  that  need  to be put  into place  in those countries  actually  are  going to  occur.  Unlessconditions  in  those  countries  become  more  transparent,  and  I mean  transparent  Western  style,reduced  foreign  capital  for investment  will  limit their economic growth.  Absent banksupervisory  reforms  and  a shoring  up of domestic bank balance  sheets, the  proverbial  creditcrunch  will  slow their recoveries.  We  say that  there are cultural  differences  when  we  try tounderstand  what  is going on  in  Asia, but  it is  difficult  to determine  how these cultural  differencesare  going to play out in  a crisis environment  and  whether  some  of these countries  are going tomake  the long-term  changes  that are needed  to stabilize  their economies.  So, even  though itappears that conditions  have stabilized,  at least in  two of these  countries,  the jury may  in fact  stillbe out with  regard  to the  long-term  economic  performance  of those  countries.  Certainly,  wecannot  say that  conditions have  stabilized in  Indonesia, and  they have  not yet  started  to improvefor Japan.  For the United  States, the  latter is  a bigger risk.For now,  I think the balance  of the  risks seems  to have shifted  toward  stronger growth.The slowdown  from Asia  is starting to  show  up, but it has not exerted  much  restraint thus  far,and  in fact it is hard  to know  how  much  of a restraining  effect  it  will have.  Inflation,  which  hasbeen  helped by weaker oil prices,  has  been quite  well contained,  but unless the  expansion  slows,3/31/98the traditional  pressures  from  scarce resources,  in  labor markets  in  particular, will have  to bepassed  on  via higher  prices.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you  very much.  I will  now  call  on  Don  Kohn.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.  Governor Phillips  and anumber of others  mentioned  money growth  in  their presentations,  and  Ithought this might be  one  of those  infrequent  occasions  when  discussion  ofthis  subject  would  be  helpful.  I will  begin  with  some  comments  on  thesurprising strength  in  money growth  and  use  that  as  a lead-in  to issuesinvolved  in the  Committee's current  policy.  I will  be  using the  chart  thatwas  distributed  this morning. 2  My remarks  will  focus  on M2 because  thataggregate has been  the one most  closely  associated  with  spending  sincedeposit rates  were deregulated  in the  early  1980s  and,  consequently,  theaggregate  most closely followed  by the  Committee  and  the  staff over thatperiod.As can  be seen in  the upper left-hand  panel,  M2 growth  has beenaccelerating  over the last few  quarters.  The pickup  in  growth  in  the secondhalf of last year and the  first quarter of  1998  does  not appear to be  a  result  ofincreasingly  faster  growth  of nominal  GDP, at  least based on  the Greenbookforecast  of current-quarter  GDP.Instead,  as  is  evident  in  the  upper right  panel,  velocity  turned down  inthe  second  half of  1997  following  several  years  in  which  a residual  uptrendin  velocity  persisted, even  after the major shifts of the early  1990s.  And thatcosts  as conventionally  measured.The middle  panel  lists a few  hypotheses  for why velocity  may berelative to  spending  toward  the end of last  year and early  in  1998.  Thesehave  included  continued  strong overseas  currency  shipments, enlargedmortgage refinancings,  which  tend to be  associated  with  temporary  depositsin liquid  accounts, the  effects  of accelerated  tax  refunds  and, perhaps,  therecent buildup  of balances  in  anticipation  of outsized  tax  bills.  Still, webelieve  that  these  special  factors  can account  for only a small  part  of M2growth  in  the fourth  and  first quarters  and  none  of the surprise because  webasically  had anticipated  them in January.A  second influence  that may be giving  an unusual  boost  to M2  growthis the flat yield  curve.  Savers  sacrifice  very little current  return,  reduce  theirexposure  to capital loss,  and gain  liquidity when  they de-emphasizelonger-term  fixed-rate investments  in  favor of liquid  assets  in M2.  In  fact,2 A  copy  of the chart  used by Mr. Kohn  is appended  to  the transcript.  (Appendix  2)3/31/98almost  all  the  growth  in  M2  in the  last two  quarters  has  been  in  its liquidcomponents--money  market  funds and  savings deposits.  Moreover,  we  sawevidence  of such  a redirection of savings  flows  in accelerated  runoffs  ofnoncompetitive  tenders  at Treasury  note and  bill  auctions  late  last year.  Butin  recent  months those runoffs have  slackened  a bit, and  flows  into bondmutual  funds have been fairly  robust, so  such  shifts probably do  not accountfor the further pickup  in  M2  growth  this year.A  third possibility is  household efforts  to rebalance  asset portfolios.Although the  ratio  of M2  to GDP  has been  rising in  recent quarters,  M2  isbecoming  a much  smaller proportion  of household  wealth  owing to thetremendous  rise in  the  market  value of equities.  In response,  people couldbe  diverting  more current  savings  or the  proceeds  of securities  sales to M2to restore desired  risk  exposures.  While  this  explanation  is plausible,  onehas to wonder  why such  shifts have begun  in  the  last few  quarters  whenequity prices  have  been  skyrocketing for several  years.Fourth,  some  scale variable  other than GDP  or wealth  may be  drivingM2 demand, or current-quarter  GDP may be  underestimated.  Income hasbeen  growing  faster than  published  or estimated  GDP,  and  so, too, in  mostquarters including  the  first, has  private  domestic  spending.  In  the past,  thesealternative  scale variables  have been  no better related to M2  over the  longrun  than has nominal  GDP.  But our  standard model  does  use consumptionspending  to explain  short-run  movements  in  M2,  and people  may beaccumulating  relatively  large  amounts  of M2 to  support  current  and  futureprivate  spending,  whose  growth,  owing to  a widening trade  deficit  anddamped  government  outlays,  is  outstripping that  of GDP.  And,  as  MikePrell  noted earlier, the  rapid  growth  of employment  in  the current quarterLastly, the  money  demand relationship  has  always  been  fairlynoisy--even  in  previous  decades  when,  in  hindsight,  it  seems to have  beenwell-behaved.  Innovations  over the  past 20  years,  which  have  made  abroader menu  of financial  assets more readily  and  inexpensively  available  tohouseholds,  should only have added  to  that noise.  We  have  never been  ableto identify  all  the factors  affecting  M2  demand,  especially  over periods  asshort as  a few  quarters,  and  undoubtedly  my list misses  some  that arerelevant now.  This uncertainty  raises  questions  about the implications  ofunexpected  variations in  M2  growth  over relatively  short time  frames  for theCommittee's  objectives  for spending  or prices.  As a consequence,  since  theearly  1980s the  Committee  has been  unwilling  to  tie its behavior too closelyto M2 or to any other monetary indicator.As you  can see  in  the bottom panel,  M2 growth  over a  year's time  hada  strong  association  with  future spending  in  the  1960s and  1970s.  But thatrelationship  has  weakened  considerably  in the  1980s  and  1990s, even3/31/98outside  the  velocity-shift  years of the  early  1990s.  The  earlier leadingindicator properties  worked  importantly through  differential  lags  in  theresponses  of money  and  spending to  changes  in interest  rates.  If, forexample,  the Federal  Reserve,  seeing money and  economic  activity  growingtoo rapidly,  raised interest  rates,  financial  portfolios  would be  reallocatedfairly promptly out  of money,  whose  rates  tended  to  adjust  sluggishly, intoHence,  money would  weaken  before  the  economy.  For money to be  aleading indicator  through  this mechanism,  the Federal  Reserve  needed toreact to  contemporaneous  or  lagging  indicators  of the  economy and  itneeded  to  move short-term  interest  rates  substantially  to  affect opportunitycosts.  Since the  early  1980s,  the  Federal  Reserve  has become  increasinglymore anticipatory,  in  effect  changing  short-term  interest  rates--and,implicitly, money  stock  growth--to  head  off swings  in  GDP, which  werethen  more  damped.  And,  of course,  in  the  last few  years  the  Committee  hasnot  had  to move  short-term  rates  very  much,  leaving  M2  largely  to fluctuatepassively with  contemporaneous  spending.  So  it is not  surprising that thereliability  of M2 as  a  leading  indicator has been  considerably  reduced.That does  not  mean  the  monetary  surge in  1997  and early  this year canbe  ignored,  aside from  the possible implication  that contemporaneous  GDPraised  M2 relative  to income  results  importantly  from  more  accommodativeconditions  in  key  sectors  of domestic  financial  markets  over recent  quarters.The decline  in  nominal  long-term  rates,  which  has flattened  the  yield  curveand  spurred  mortgage  refinancing,  and  the rise  in  equity  values,  which  haselevated tax  obligations  and  increased  asset portfolios,  have  boosted bothM2 and  spending.  And we haven't  discussed  M3,  whose  very  rapidexpansion  is related  in large measure  to accelerating  credit  growth  atdepository  institutions,  which,  in  turn, is  part  of a broader  pickup in  theavailability  and use  of credit.  The  relationship  between  money  and currentor future  spending  may not  be  very tight, but  from  this perspective  stronggrowth  of money  reinforces  the message  from  other financial  marketindicators  that financial  conditions  are  quite supportive  of domesticspending,  once we look past the  level  of the  real  federal  funds rate.It  was  those  financial  conditions,  along  with the  lagged  multiplier-accelerator  effects  of recent economic  strength  that  led the  staff to  raise thelevel  of spending throughout  the  forecast period.  To  some extent,  the staffprojection  may  simply  be  catching up to  the  Committee, but  the recentupward  revisions do  highlight the  risks  in the  outlook.  Even  in January,  theforecasts  of both  the staff and FOMC  members portrayed  the economy  asoperating  beyond most  estimates  of its sustainable  potential,  at  least in  thelabor market.  Obviously,  the revisions  accentuate  that tendency,  and  in  thestaff forecast  underlying  inflation  has  assumed  a  more discernible  upwardtilt.  Thus,  the  data on  the economy and  financial  markets  along with3/31/98forecast  revisions would  seem to  argue  for more serious  consideration  of anear-term  firming  of policy.But there  remain  reasons why the Committee  may want  to  wait.  It wassupply  uncertainties--questions  about whether  the economy  might be  able tosustain  faster expansion  through  faster productivity  growth  and  a higherlevel  of resource  utilization  than  suggested by  history--that  deterred  theCommittee  from tightening  last fall,  and those  uncertainties  have  not beenresolved.  Despite  a low  unemployment  rate and  anecdotes  of strains  inlabor markets,  wage  and  compensation  inflation  still seems  to be moving uponly  slowly.  Price inflation  remains  largely quiescent,  and  a resumption ofrobust investment  spending  in the  first quarter  should keep  industrialcapacity  ample.  On  the other  side, disappointing  profits  in  fourth-quarterdata and  first-quarter estimates, perhaps  associated  in  part with  weakerproductivity  performance,  may be early  signs of emerging  cost pressures.On  the demand  side  of the  economy, robust  domestic  spending  hasbeen expected  to a considerable  extent,  and  the questions have  involved thecoming offset from  the foreign  sector,  which  is just emerging  in the  data.The  size and  timing of the offset  remain  very uncertain,  given the  stillunfolding drama in  Asia and  the scarcity of  precedents  for gauging itseffects  on the  U.S.  economy.  In  a fundamental  sense the situation  has notchanged that  much  over the long  intermeeting  period.  The Committeeremains  in  the difficult  position of waiting for a moderating influence  ofunknown  dimensions,  with the  economy uncomfortably  strong and  ebullientfinancial  markets  feeding that  strength--it's just that the economy  is strongerand markets  more  ebullient than  anticipated.On  the positive  side, developments  in  train to  support growth  andcontain  inflation  mean  that the ill  effects  of either too  much  or too littleexternal  sector restraint  are likely to be  muted for some time.  This may givethe Committee  some breathing  room to  gauge the economic  situation,  atleast for a short  time, without  risking the  need  for substantially moredisruptive policy  action  at a later  date.  The unusually  favorable  economicperformance  of the last few  years  is generating  its  own  momentum:  low andexpectations,  damping wage  and price  increases,  even  if economicexpansion  is  strong  and labor market  pressures intensify.  And robustgrowth  has bolstered  confidence  and  equity markets,  supporting domesticdemand  and  growth  even  if external  demand  weakens more  than expected.The effects  of this  momentum  are reinforced  in  the short run  by the  Asiancrisis  itself.  The rise in  the  dollar and drop  in  oil  prices  on  balance  since lastfall  will  add  to restraint on  inflation for a while.  On  the  spending  side,  thedrop in  oil prices and  the decline in  intermediate-  and long-term  interestrates seem  to be stimulating  demand  before the adverse  effects  of lowerforeign  income  and higher dollar exchange  rates  are felt.  In  effect,  financial3/31/98and  commodity  markets  have  anticipated  oncoming  Asian  effects  on realGDP, providing  some  near-term  stimulus  to  spending.  In  this regard,  theCommittee  is facing  a combination  of near-term  stimulus  and projectedrestraint  similar to that  associated  with  a fiscal  policy tightening whoseimplementation  is  delayed  but which  has already reduced  interest rates.If the Committee  decides to  leave the  stance  of policy unchanged  at thismeeting, it still  needs to consider  the symmetry  of the  directive.  Moving  toan  asymmetrical  directive  toward tightening  would reflect  a judgment,ultimately  conveyed  to the public,  that information  and analysis  becomingavailable since  the  symmetrical  directive  was  adopted in  December havetilted the risks  enough  to make tightening  a clear possibility in  thenot-too-distant  future.  Retaining  a symmetrical  directive would indicate  thatthere  remained enough  uncertainty  about  the outlook  at this point  to  castsignificant  doubt on this outcome.Of course,  a symmetrical  directive  would not  rule out  a near-termaction--at  the  next  meeting or  earlier--if warranted  by new  information.Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions for Don?  If not,  let me  get started.It is quite  evident,  as  Governor Rivlin  said, that  the  performance  of this economy  isabout  the best that  we can  possibly  imagine.  I suspect  that  I have  been  watching  the  economylonger than anyone  around  this table,  so I can  confirm  that statement  in terms  of personalobservation  over  an extended  period.  The economy's  performance  is absolutely  unusual.  Itseems  to be caught in  the  grip of a virtuous  wealth-effect  cycle.  That  is, the  extraordinarydomestic  demand  that  we are  observing  is  almost surely  a spillover from  the  unbelievableuptrend  in  the ratio  of wealth  to disposable  income that  we have  experienced  over the pastseveral  years.  As  we know,  the  wealth  effect  has  a lagged  and cumulative  effect  that  begins toflatten  out only  after there  occurs  a significant  and  evident  slowing of wealth  creation.  There  isno evidence  of the latter.  I think the Dow is  up about  1,000  points so far this  year.Clearly, the  situation  is difficult  to get  into context  because  if we take the level  of, say,the  S&P  500 and decompose  it into the  riskless rate  of interest,  the projected rate  of growth in3/31/98earnings,  and, as  a residual  calculation,  the  equity premium,  we  end up  with  an equity premiumthat is at  the lower  end  of the  historical  range of experience  even  if we  accept the  Street'sestimates  of quite  extraordinary  growth  in  earnings.  While it  is not as  low as  it  was  in  thesummer of  1987,  it is  quite low  relative to  any recent period  and it  has  been  moving down  at  afairly  dramatic pace.  That  in  and  of itself doesn't  tell  us  terribly  much until  we  look  at  theimplications  of the earnings  expectations  that are  implicit in that structure.  If we  convert theearnings expectations  for the  S&P  500 into operating  profits in  the  NIPA accounts,  then profitindefinitely;  they eventually  break  through  to all  time highs  and  still  continue  to  rise.  Everythingwe know  about  the way  the  system  functions  implies  that that  is  an utterly  unrealisticexpectation.The question,  however, is how  far the rise in  stock market prices  can  go.  We knowfrom  history that  markets  can be perceived  as  overvalued  for an  exceptionally  long period oftime.  It  is quite  conceivable,  as  the  Vice  Chair says, that the extraordinary  flows  into equitymutual  funds  can  sustain  this  market phenomenon  for a while.  But  countering that  is somethingthat was not very evident  the  last time we  met, namely,  that operating earnings  are beginning tocome up short of forecasts,  and  indeed their growth  rate clearly has  begun  to  decline in  the pastseveral  months.  These  are not the  numbers that are  showing up  so  far in the  earnings  per shareof the S&P 500 companies  because  that index  provides  a biased  estimate of total  earnings.  TheS&P  500,  by the nature  of its  selection  criteria,  picks up those companies  that are growing  mostrapidly  and whose earnings  generally  have been  quite  impressive.  Nonetheless,  there is no doubtthat  the earnings  growth  numbers  are slowing  down.3/31/98That  means that  for the first time in  evaluating  the  unit cost  structure  of nonfinancialcorporations,  we  are  not  looking at the  phenomenon  that  I have referred  to many times  at thesemeetings  of a very  low inflation  rate  and  stable or rising operating  profit  margins, the  directimplication  of which  is that  growth  of unit costs  is negligible.  We are  still  seeing very lowinflation.  The estimates  through  the first  quarter  are  about as  low  as  we have  seen  for quite  awhile,  oil  obviously  being a  relevant  factor here.  But even  apart  from  oil  prices, we  do not  yetsee any  meaningful  acceleration  of inflation.  The evidence  of pricing power  on  the part ofbusiness is  still  lacking.  There  is  no  anecdotal  evidence  of which  I am  aware--and  I have  notheard  any in  the  discussion  here--that  suggests  a change  in the  suppression  of pricing power.Indeed,  in  the Beigebook  summary,  I have  forgotten  the exact phrase, but it was  noted thatpressures  on  product  prices were  "eerily  calm."  That in fact  is characteristic  of what  is going  onat  this  stage.  We  have  very  little evidence  of inflation,  but  we are  beginning  to see  pressuresemerge  in  the  cost  structure,  and  that  obviously  is one  of the  reasons  why profit  margins  arebeginning  to slip.Even  though  we continue to  get  declining unit  nonlabor costs,  we  are beginning  to seesome  acceleration,  still  not large,  in  unit labor costs.  In  the nonfinancial  corporate  sector,  we areseeing  an increase  in hourly  compensation  at a rate  of roughly  4  percent.  That  rate  is  notaccelerating  at  this  stage,  and  I suspect  one  of the  reasons  is that  firms  are  using  every novel  waythey can  devise to keep compensation  costs down.  Obvious  also are  their efforts  to improveproductivity.The productivity  numbers  are  very rough  estimates because  we  are  measuring  a wholeset  of product  outputs from one  set of data  and a  whole  set of labor inputs  from a different  set.That they come  out even  remotely measuring  actual  labor productivity  is open  to question  in  my3/31/98view.  Nonetheless,  we  do see  some slowdown in  the published  data,  although  output per hourestimated through  the  first quarter  of  1998  for nonfinancial  corporate  business  still  shows  a 2.3percent increase  from four quarters  earlier.  That is down  only  modestly  from a year ago  butdown  significantly  from the surge  that we saw  in the middle  of last  year,  which  surely was  anaberration.  As you  will  recall,  BLS  estimates  that output per hour increased  at a 6.3  percentannual  rate in  the  third quarter  of  1997.  It just is not possible for productivity  to increase  thatfast.  I think  the four-quarter  average  is  more  meaningful.  Productivity gains  in  these  data appearto be sufficiently  strong to  keep increases  in  unit labor costs  down to  an  annual  rate  of about 1-1/2percent  for nonfinancial  corporations.Basically, we  are observing a  very  substantial  wealth  effect  but  one  that  has not  yetspilled over to a significant extent  into the  product area,  creating  shortages  of goods  and  services.As you know,  there  are none.  The National  Association  of Purchasing  Managers'  surveyindicates what  I think is  a record  lull in  reported  shortages  of materials.  There is  no evidence  oftightness in  facilities.  There  is exceptional  tightness in  labor markets,  obviously, and  if anything,they  are getting  tighter.  We have  a phenomenon  that I don't think  we have  seen  in  the postWorld War II  period.  This economic performance  is really  different.  I don't know  how onewould determine  what  it  is,  but  there is  some  "X"  factor,  a  missing variable in  our basic  models,that  has to be  there to explain  why even  with these  exceptionally  tight  labor markets,  we  are onlygetting an  increase in  compensation  per hour of slightly more than 4 percent  and,  moreimportantly,  why pricing power is not evident  in  this  situation.Nonetheless,  there is  very little evidence  to suggest  that monetary  policy is tight.  Wecannot  explain  why the  underlying demands  in the interest-sensitive  areas  of the  economy  are  asstrong as they are,  and  I will  even  acknowledge  that maybe the  weather has  had  some  effect  on3/31/98both  housing  and some  sectors  of the  retail  markets  that are  displaying  more  strength  than onewould expect,  at  least on  a  historical  basis,  given the  level  of short-term interest  rates.All  in  all,  we  have  an  economic  performance  that is essentially  unsustainable.  It  isunsustainable  in  two contexts.  One, the stock  market  as  far as I can  see cannot  sustain  its currentstrength.  The  aggregative  virtuous cycle  that is embodied  in it cannot keep  going withoutultimately  running off the  track.  There is  no credible  model  of which  I  am  aware  that embodiesall  of this.  In  my judgment,  echoing a  good  deal  of what has been  said  around  this table, unlesseither profit  margins  decline  or some  other developments  break the  back  of this  stock  marketsurge in the  very short run  and  take  much  of the strength  out  of the  forces  that  dominate thisexpansion,  we  will have  more  inflation.  Even  so,  the adjustment  cannot  happen  very  rapidlyeven  though  the  economy  could  begin  to  go  in  a different  direction.  One alternative  scenario isthat the  fallout  from  the  Asian  situation, which  as  far  as  the  Greenbook  is  concerned  is  about  toexert  a significant effect  on our  economy, actually  will  do so.  It is generally  correct  to say thatthe economies  of Southeast  Asia  are very  weak.  The  Japanese  government  estimates  thatindustrial  production  will  be  significantly  negative  in February  and  March.  The  first quarter  isvery clearly much  weaker  than the fourth.  I  think that,  if anything, the Japanese  economy is  in  afairly  pronounced  recession  at  this  stage.  That  is  also the  case  in Thailand  and  Korea  whereproduction  has  fallen  very  dramatically.  The weakness  associated  with  Asian  developments  hasnot yet  reached  these  shores fully, but  there have been  some pricing  repercussions  and  ordersclearly  have  been  affected.  But it is  by no means  clear that  even  at  its full  force,  as  a number ofyou  including  Bill Poole  have  indicated, the Asian  effect  will be  enough to undercut  thisexpansion  to an extent  that drives  it off track.3/31/98Therefore,  in  a sense  responding  to Cathy  Minehan's  question of when  we  will  start  tomove,  I believe  that we  are running  out  of time.  I  think that  unless this  system  starts toself-correct  fairly  shortly, we  will  have no  choice but to  move.  In  the  process,  we  could  verywell  crack the stock  market.  We could  affect  a lot of things  because this  benevolent  virtuouscycle probably  has  also  created  an increasing  vulnerability  in the  sense that  yield  spreads  havefallen  to unbelievable  numbers,  the  slack  attitude  of lending  officers has become  a  potentialconcern,  and  the risks that  people  normally  are  worried  about have  tended to be ignored.  All  thismeans  that if we have a  sharp adjustment,  it  will  occur  at  a time  when the  vulnerability  of theeconomic  system  is  far greater  than  is the case  when we  have a  great  deal  of uncertainty.  Thereis too little uncertainty  in  this  system.  Human  nature has  not changed  and  when it  reassertsitself, things  are  going to look  a  lot different.To  translate all  of this into policy,  I  think we  ought to  be moving  back  to  asymmetry  atthis stage  because  developments  since  the  last meeting  have  changed  economic  conditionsenough to justify that.  I  do not think it is  appropriate to  move at this  stage.  Were we  to do  so,  Ibelieve  we  would create  too  large a  shock  to the  system,  which  it would  not be  able  to absorbquickly.  More  importantly,  I  don't think  there is that much  urgency.  What we  are  observing  cango on  for a quite  significant  period  of time.  While  I  agree with  those who  say that  product  priceinflation  ultimately  has  to accelerate  and  something  has  to give  at some  point if the growth  ofeffective  domestic  demand continues  at the  current pace, that is not necessarily  going to happenvery quickly.  That's because the productivity  numbers  are reasonably  strong  and the  absence  ofpricing power is  still  very  much  a factor  in holding down  inflation.  It is  by no means  evident  ifwe look,  for example,  at the  chain-weighted  GDP  deflator or the  domestic  purchases  deflator,that prices  are in  any  sense  accelerating.  Indeed,  the  first-quarter estimate  is the lowest  we  have3/31/98seen in  this cyclical  expansion.  Part of the  explanation  obviously  is oil,  though  I don't knowwhat that  part is.  But  as  we discussed  before,  we just cannot  take  oil  out  of our  inflationmeasures  and make  believe it  does not  exist;  it  is  too big  a factor  in  an economy.  As  I see  it, theoverall inflation  rate has  shown  no evidence  of accelerating  at this  stage.  To  be  sure,  the  coreCPI did show  an  uptick, but a good  part of that  is tobacco,  which is  no longer  an  open  marketproduct.  While airline  fares did go  up  and  they are  an  open  market product,  we are  not  yetgetting the inflation  pressure.  So,  I think that  we have to be, as  the Vice Chair said,  on  a newalert because  if this expansion  does  not  slow  down, we  will  have  to start to move.  I think theclock is  starting  to tick,  and  my guess  is that  unless  the evidence  of an Asian  slowdown  is fairlypronounced  and/or  the stock market  goes in  the other direction,  we will  be  singing a differenttune the  next time we meet.So, I  would recommend  and  put  "B"  asymmetric  on the table for  consideration.  I feeluncomfortable  about switching  back  to  asymmetry  after having moved to  symmetry  so  recently,but I think the  real  world has changed.  Vice  Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I  support  your proposal.  Ithink it  would be unwise  to change our policy  today,  but  what  you have  said  and  the  generaltenor of the  comments  around  the table  convince  me that  we  will not hesitate to  move when  theevidence  is  somewhat more clear  that  that is  the appropriate  thing to do.  For now,  I believe that"B"  asymmetric  toward  tightening  is  the right policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I certainly  support your recommendation  of no changeat the  present  time and  I very enthusiastically  support the move  to  asymmetry.  It seems  to  methat  the  discussion  strongly supports  such  a move.3131/98I have  a  question.  It relates  to my recollection  that  when  we  talked  about  how wewere  going to  handle the  public  announcement  of a no-change  decision,  we  discussed  thepossibility of making  a  statement  to accompany  such  an  announcement.  If one thinks  thateconomic  developments  are moving  in  a direction  where  it  is likely  that a  change in  policy wouldoccur--say,  at the next  meeting--and  given  that you  have stressed  the  importance  of laying  afoundation  for a policy  change,  the  adoption  of asymmetry  clearly  could  lay  a foundation.  Butunder our  current  procedures  the  asymmetry  is announced  two days  after  the next  meeting,  so thepublic  is  not put on notice  on  a  timely  basis.  I  wonder if there  is  some  virtue  to making  astatement  in  our announcement  about  the  strength of the  economy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  is  an  interesting  question.  I would  appreciatehearing  other comments  on  that.  Vice  Chair, do you have  a  comment?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  If the  economy  continues  to move in  thisdirection  between  now  and  the next  meeting,  I think  that we would  have to begin  preparing  theway.  I  do not  object  to what  Bob  Parry  is suggesting.  Marginally,  I  would prefer that you  do itin  a  policy speech.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That would  be my inclination.  The reason  I  would  feeluncomfortable  with  a  short press  statement is that  we  could not leave  it at  that.  The  questionwould remain  as to  why we  did it.  If it  appears  that economic  developments  are beginning  tomove  us toward  a  policy change,  I  think we  will  have  a  lot more  to explain.  I might  add,incidentally,  that we  cannot be perceived  as  moving  to thwart the  stock  market.  That may beimplicit in  our analysis  of what the economy  is  doing, but  a  move  to curb the  buildup  in stock3/31/98The argument  is that  the  wealth  effect  is driving domestic  demand,  which  in  turn  is  driving theproduct  markets,  but it cannot  be  other than  that, if I may put  it that way.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I can  appreciate  the  viewpoint  that Bill  McDonoughexpressed,  and I can  understand  that there may be opportunities  for you to lay that  foundation.  Itis obvious  that if we do not  change  our current  procedure,  then  going to  asymmetry  does  notaccomplish  what we want.  Asymmetry  would serve  to alert the public  only if a decision  tochange our policy were  delayed  beyond the next  meeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I think we  have  an unsustainable  situation.  Unless  we are  quitefortunate  and  get  some offset  to inflationary  demand  pressures  other than through  policy  action,we  indeed will  have to face  up to making  a policy  adjustment  and probably  more than  once.On the  issue of preparing  the  market,  I think a policy  speech  by you  at the  appropriatetime is  far superior  to  a two  or three sentence  press  release.  There  are  a couple of reasons:  One,I think that if you  need  to  make  such  a policy  statement,  we  have  to be  prepared  to follow  fairlyquickly with  policy  action.  We don't want  to  get  ourselves  into a "cry  wolf" situation  where  wetalk  and do not act.  So,  I would  prefer that  you wait until it looks  as  though  a policy  action needsto  take place.  Your speech  would  prepare the  markets  at  that  time, and  a policy  action  wouldfollow.  Ultimately,  it  is  actions, not  words,  that count,  and words  will  only matter if they  arefollowed by  action.  Second,  I would  suggest  that in addition  to the usual  macroeconomicrationale for  action,  such  a policy  speech  should  stress  that  we like good  times, that  we  likepeople to  have jobs,  and that we are  acting to sustain  the good times.  The point was made  earlierthat the  lower echelons  of the labor  force are  now  beginning to participate  in this prosperity,  andthey would be the first  to  be  unemployed if things  went  awry.  I think  it is  important  that we  also3/31/98make  a point like  that because  it  helps to  give a balanced  view  of our policy.  It indicates  that weare not against  growth  and  against lower echelon  workers  making progress  and,  indeed,  that weare  moving  to sustain  such progress.  I would urge  you  to add  that  to the  usual  macro analysis.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I expected  the general  tone of this meeting  to bemore  bullish  than  it  was at  the February  meeting, but the bullish  comments  today have exceededmy  expectations!  So, it will  not surprise  you  or anyone else  that  I would  still  prefer to takeaction  today.  Governor  Gramlich's  comments  about  operating  with  a funds  rate target  resonatedwith  me.  It  is certainly true that  we  have  had  some  movement  in  the real  federal  funds  rate,  butwe  have  pegged the nominal  funds rate for almost  two  years.  Obviously, if we  do not move  therate  itself at  this meeting,  I would certainly  support  very, very strongly  your  recommendation  forasymmetry.I have a lot  of sympathy  with  the point  that Bob Parry made,  and I was in  fact  going toraise  the same  issue.  I think  that if we  do  move to an  asymmetric  directive,  it would be  desirableto announce  that decision  now rather than  waiting for six  or seven  weeks.  I believe  it isimportant, to  use Bill  McDonough's metaphor,  for us to  let people  know  that  the guardian  isthere  and the  guardian is  awake.  I know  there are  some problems  with  this  suggestion,  but  onecould make  a good  case for routinely  announcing  the directive  language  tilt  concurrently  ratherthan  shortly  after the  following meeting.  The  tilt language  is  after all  a routine part  of thedirective;  there  are questions  about this  practice,  but we  do  in fact  follow it.  I don't see  anycompelling  reason not  to release  it concurrently.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Wouldn't  it be better to start  doing that  when  it doesnot  matter?3/31/98way--

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If we  are to establish  a precedent,  it  seems  best to do  sowhen it  does  not  create  problems.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  That's a  good  point.  It  may be  that the best  way to  go  aboutpreparing the  markets currently  is  for you to make  a  speech  of some  sort  where you bring  thismatter up.  But  I think  that  we  might  want to  consider later  the  other alternative  of announcingsomething  immediately  after each  meeting.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank  you.  Referring  back to something  I said  earlier about  theopening  sentence  in the general  paragraphs  of the directive,  I think we do need  to make  a  changethere.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think  that already  has been  done.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  After having  listened to your earlier  comment,  I thinkwise  heads  around here made  a change.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  I agree  with  Ed  Boehne  about  what to include  in our public  commentsconcerning the  reasons  for our policy actions.  I still  think that our actions in  early  1994,  properlyviewed,  prevented  the recession  of 1996.  What  we are  faced  with today is  how to prevent  thenext credit  crunch  and  recession  of the  year 2000.  We will  have  enough  other problems  in theyear 2000  without having to  deal  with  a recession  and  a real  estate  debacle.  I thought that  yourremarks,  Mr. Chairman,  developed  a persuasive  case for acting  now.  I  am not particularlyconcerned  about  the stock  market.  I agree  that it is not a reason to  do something,  but in  my view3/31/98it  also is not  a  reason not  to do something.  I believe  that reasons  for taking  action  would be theexcessive growth  of the whole  constellation  of money  and  credit  aggregates,  the upward  revisionof expectations  about  the  growth  of economic  activity,  and  what  is  going  on in  the  bankingindustry and  especially  in  the real  estate  markets.  A 1/4  percentage  point  increase in  the federalfunds rate  now  would deliver  a very  important  message.  We are  going to  get some  first-quarternumbers  that will  make it obvious  to everybody  why we  acted.  I  am  concerned  that on  the  basisof the  published  information,  the case  on  the  surface  for a  move  may  not be  as  compelling  by themiddle  of May  as  it is today,  so I  would  strongly  prefer taking action  today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I  can  accept  your recommendation  as  you  presented  it.There  is information  that  suggests  we  can  wait:  the relatively  high  real  federal  funds  rate,  fairlylow  and trendless  inflation  right now,  and  bond markets  that  are  signaling  benign  inflationexpectations.  But there is  also  an  issue  of timing.  I  believe  we  should  move  fairly  soon,  if not  atthis  meeting, because of the  information  on  the economy:  Our labor  markets  are  obviously  tight,aggregate  demand  growth  remains  quite robust, monetary  growth  is accelerating  even  thoughthere  is uncertainty  about velocity,  and  finally, there  are increasingly  frequent  reports  of largeamounts  of global liquidity  seeking investment outlets  and  accelerating  the  inflation  of assets.These  developments  do  give  me  some  pause  and  some concern.  So,  yes,  I  can  wait,  but I  have asense of some  pressure to  act  on  a relatively  prompt basis.

MR.  MEYER.  The whole  directive.  On  the other hand,  I think that  proposal  deservesa  full  discussion  of the pros  and cons  before  we move  forward.  If we  decide to  go in  thatdirection,  we might  want  to do so  at  a time  when the  directive  would  not  create a  surprise  when itis  released.  There  are  some  relevant issues.  A  change  from  symmetry  to asymmetry  sends  someindication  of partial  tightening or easing  to  the market,  and  our willingness  to move fromsymmetry  to  asymmetry  may  be  affected  by whether  or not  we  are  going  to announce  that move,depending  on  what impact  it is going to  have  on  the  market.  Another consideration,  Mr.Chairman,  would be that  your signaling  to  the markets  in  a speech  would  allow  you to providemore  explanation,  and  I think that would  be desirable  at this point  also.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  could  I  comment  on  whether we  should make  such  anannouncement?  In  earlier discussions,  I  have  expressed some  sympathy  with  what PresidentParry  was  talking  about regarding  announcements  because  I  believe  more information  is ofvalue.  However, like  others,  I  think that  if we release  a  statement  on this  occasion,  we will  haveset a  precedent  and  we will  have  to  continue  making  statements  going  forward.  I  do think  thatrequires  a fair  amount  of discussion  of what  the impact  will be  and how  we  want to manage  that.For that reason,  I  would  also encourage  you  to prepare  the markets  in  a sense  through  a  verycarefully  drawn  up  speech  that outlines  the issues  that we face  and  gives the market  moreinformation  than  would  a  short  statement after  each  meeting.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Poole.3/31/98

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I  am very  surprised  that in recent  months the  markets  have  respondedso little  to the stronger than  anticipated  economic  data.  The  markets have  absolutely  solidexpectations  that  we  will  not move.  I  think it is  very unfortunate  that that  situation  faces  us  aswe  sit here today.  As an  outsider, I  also  have been  puzzled  about  the asymmetric  directivebecause  it  appears  six weeks  or more  after the time it is  adopted.  It  may turn out that  themessage  is not what  we want  at the  time it actually  appears.  I  think we  know  what kind  ofmessage  we  would  like to  give today and  would  expect  from the remarks  that  the  Chairmanintends  to  give at  the  appropriate  time--namely,  that the  markets  need to be  prepared  for atightening  in  the future.  The  asymmetric  directive,  if released  quickly, could  be a mechanism  forproviding that message.  I  hope  that we can  deal  with  this issue  very promptly.  I  agree that  weneed to  discuss it, but I hope  we can  have  it on  the agenda  quite  soon  and  perhaps  make  apromptly  might  have some  benefits.  But I  find  it puzzling that if we adopt  an  asymmetricdirective  today, which  I  am prepared  to support,  it will  not be released  until  after the  nextmeeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  think we  ought to put  it on  the  agenda  for the  nextmeeting.  That issue  has  not come  up in that  form  until  very recently,  and  I  think it  is worthwhilediscussing it.

[SECTION]

MR.  POOLE.  I, like  everyone else  around the  table,  am well  aware that  the  inflationnumbers  look very  good.  But I  am concerned that we  are  at a very  vulnerable  stage.  We couldhave  some bad  news  and  once  a rise in  inflation  gets  going,  particularly  if our policy has  gottenbehind,  it is going to  be very  hard  to catch  up.  So,  I think  we want  to move before  we  see  anyworsening  in  the inflation numbers.  That  is  what  is  going to keep  it all  under control.3/31/98

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  1, too,  support  your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman,  and I share BillPoole's concern  about  the timing  of the release  of the asymmetry.  We now release  it at  a pointwhen it does  not do  us  any  good,  and  I think the  implication  of that is what  Ed Boehne  wastalking about.  You can  give  a policy  speech  that elaborates  on our current  attitudes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I  agree  with  your recommendation.  A  lot  has  beensaid  already,  and  I don't  want to repeat  it.  In  my view,  the  one thing that  may well  undo  thisexpansion  and  all  its benefits  to  society is for inflation  to  start to  accelerate  and require  us  to takesome very  severe  action.  So,  I think it is absolutely  essential  that we look  ahead  and that  ourpolicy be preemptive.  The  last thing we  want  is  to be caught in  a situation  where  we are behindthe  curve.  I do think it  is important to  lay  the foundation  for a policy  action,  and  I think thesuggestion  of a policy  speech  that  you  and  Bill  McDonough  made  is an  excellent  one.  I alsowant to  associate  myself with  Ed Boehne's  comments  about  the nature  of the speech.  I thoughtthat he  had  some very  good  suggestions  about how  to  explain  our objectives  in terms  of thebroad-based  benefits  from  sustainable  economic  growth  that we want  to  see  continued  for thebenefit  of  all  segments  of our society.I think  we  should review  how we  use asymmetric  or symmetric  directives.  I believewe  should have  a policy  for that.  We should  use  symmetry in  a systematic  way,  and I wouldprepare the  markets  for  any changes  that we may make  in our disclosure  of that  aspect  of ourpolicy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Ferguson.3/31/98

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  agree  with  your recommendation  of "B"asymmetric.  I  think it is important  that we  signal  that we  are  both  vigilant  and want  to  maintainthe  gains that  already  have  been  made.When  we  removed  the asymmetry  from the  directive  in  December,  I asked  one  of theother Board  members  why  we  did not  announce  the change then.  I  was  told that it  was  becausewe  would then  be  announcing  two  different  policies  at  the same  time.  I  wasn't  sure  I understoodthat  explanation  then,  and  I'm not sure  I  understand  it  now,  but I  do  think  that--

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  It  sounded okay!

[SECTION]

MR.  FERGUSON.  It was  one  of many explanations! I  believe, however,  that  theissue  deserves  more  consideration.  So,  I would  not  rush  into announcing  now, but I do  think  weshould  discuss  the issue  at the next  meeting.  I recognize  that we will  have  some  explanations  tomake  when  we  move  to tighten  policy because,  while  inflation  pressures  are building,  there  alsoare  low inflation  numbers  and  low  inflation  expectations.  In  my view,  all  of these  considerationspoint  more in  the direction  of a policy  speech  as  opposed  to  simply a quick  announcement  afterthe  meeting.  I would  associate  myself with  what President  Boehne  had to  say with  respect  tomaking  sure that  people recognize  the context  in  which  our policy  action  is  undertaken  and  toremind  people  that  the economic  benefits we  have achieved  to date  have  come  from  lowinflation.  I  believe it is important to  keep  those two things  in  mind.I  guess  the only other concern  I would have  relates  to our trying  to think  through  ourpolicy  strategy going  forward.  It  might be appropriate  at some  meeting, perhaps  the  next  if itlooks  as though  we  are on a  new  policy trend,  to  be quite clear with  ourselves  as  to exactly whatour strategy  is.  This is what  I  think Governor  Gramlich  was  referring  to earlier.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.3/31/98

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too,  support your  recommendation  and Iam pleased  with the  return  to asymmetry.  I take  heart,  as  I guess everyone  else does,  from ourresolve  not to wait  too long.Just to  finish  that thought,  I guess it is  obvious  in what  has been  said  by Bill Poole,Gary  Stern,  and others  that  not only  do we not have  a  way to  signal  our move  to asymmetrytoday, but the  minutes  that  will  come out in  a couple  of days  will  show  us in  a symmetricalstance  at  the  February meeting.  This development  seems  to cry  out for some kind of mechanismto correct  what  I think will  be  a misimpression  that we  would  prefer not to give  in the  nextcouple of days.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That's right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I strongly  support  your recommendation.Relative to the discussion  about  a possible announcement,  I would have  a very  strongpreference  for not making  one  today.  That  preference  is based  on  a longer-term  reason  and  animmediate reason.  The longer-term  reason  would  be the  one that has  been expressed  around thetable,  namely, that  this  would have  a precedential  impact  and one  that we  should considercarefully,  not just rush  into.  I will  say  parenthetically--we  are  not going to  debate  that  issuetoday--that  I have  very  great reservations  about the  whole idea.More immediately,  I believe  that if we  were  to  make a  new type of announcementtoday  that the market  has  not  seen before  and  does not expect, it would  come as  quite a shockand be  very  confusing.  Why are they doing  this?  Why did they  make this announcement  andnot change policy?  I  can  see the potential  for a reaction  of fairly major proportions that  wouldnot be at  all  what we  are  setting  out to  do.  So,  I would be  very hesitant  about that.3/31/98

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  support  your recommendation,  but I  think we  shouldremind ourselves  that, with the  exception  of Bill  Poole,  we  have  all been  here  before.  Thesituation  has changed  and  we  have  a  new view  of the  outlook.  It is not inconceivable  that  wewill  be back  in  six  weeks  when  something, presumably  developments  in  Asia, has  weakened  theexpansion  and we may not  be quite as  sure as  we  seem  to be today  that  everything is moving  inthe  direction  of an  overly strong  economy.  But I  certainly  agree that that is how  it  looks today.I  also have  a lot of sympathy  with  the  suggestion  to  announce  our  asymmetry  decisionimmediately.  I think  we  all wish  that we had  already  adopted  that policy so  that we  could saysomething  about  asymmetry  in  our announcement  today.  But if we change  our announcementpolicy  in midstream  without  any prior  discussion,  it  probably  would be better  to raise the  fedfunds  rate today than  to do this peculiar  and unexpected  thing.I  also  would  like to  stress  the  importance  not just of your  making  a  policy  speech,  butthat there  be a  series  of policy  speeches  with  all  of us  weaving into  our  remarks more  about  howwe feel.  I  would  suggest that the emphasis  should  be  on our worries  about speculation,  loosecredit,  and other  concerns  that  people can  relate to rather  than  saying that we think  the economyought to be restrained  because  we  are  very  worried  about  tight  labor markets  and poor peopleearning  more money.  That  sounds  silly when  you  say it  that way,  but  sometimes  we come  acrossas though  our real  worries  are  tight labor markets  rather than  the  objective,  as  Bill McDonoughsaid  earlier, of keeping the labor markets  tight and  retaining  the benefits  of full  employment  forthe future.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.3/31/98

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank  you.  I think we  can  hold  off for now.  I do  not see  anyimmediate  pressure  to act.  But unless  the  economy  cools  off, I believe  we will  have  to  tighten.With respect  to  symmetry  or asymmetry,  I think that if we were to  act in  theintermeeting  period,  we  would have  a telephone  conference  anyway,  so  I'm not sure  that the typeof symmetry we  adopt  means too  much.  In  that vein,  I would  not vote  against  asymmetry.  Ithink a  policy speech  probably  is better for now,  but I agree  with  President Boehne that  weshould be prepared  to act  shortly  after that  speech.  I also  agree  that it is the  sustainability  ofeconomic  growth  that  is  the issue,  and  that  is what  should be emphasized  in  our  speeches.  Ibelieve  that  it probably  would be  useful  to have a discussion  to consider  the  possible  release ofthe  directive  after each  meeting.  I have  not  at this  point thought  through  the  pros and  the  cons,but  such  a discussion  might clear up the question  of whether  symmetry  or asymmetry  meansanything.  So,  I look  forward  to that discussion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MCTEER.  I support your recommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I came  to this  meeting  prepared  to vote  for anincrease  of 25  basis  points  in the  federal  funds rate,  and  I also came  prepared  to dissent if we  didnot at  least move to  asymmetry.  I am  glad that  your recommendation  is to move  to  asymmetry.I support  it, but I am  concerned  that  we  continue to  face the difficulty of explaining  a tighteningmove in  the  context  of declining  price trends.  Of course,  our expectations  are  that those pricetrends  will  turn  around  over the course  of the  period during  which  our current  monetary policyhas an  effect.  I  also am  concerned  about  what you  have  so eloquently  described  as  thevulnerability  in financial  markets  and  what  President Poole has  described  as  the  lack  of3/31/98uncertainty in  those  markets.  I think we  face  a real  risk of feeding the  speculative  excess  thatwill ultimately  come to  haunt us if we  do  not move soon.  That  may  still mean  moving  when  wehave  broad price  trends  that  do not suggest  major inflation  upticks.  I frankly believe,  along  withI think at  least one  other member  of the Committee,  that moving  now might  be easier  thanmoving later, given  the transitory  effects  of Asia.  But,  again,  I am willing  to go  along with  yourproposal.I have  felt for some time that  an  announcement  of no  change  is as  much a policy  moveas an  announcement  of a change.  So, when  we  do not  change  our policy, I think  it would  behelpful  to  go beyond  saying  at 2:15:  "the meeting ended at  such  and  such  a  time."  If we canfigure  out  a way  to say  in one  or two sentences  why  we  made  a policy  change,  we could  figureout  a way  to  say in  one or two sentences  why we  did  not make a policy  change  and  what  ourgeneral policy  attitude is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  could be part  of the  discussion  that we  will  have  atthe  next meeting because  it  is part  of the  same  issue.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Right,  and that takes me to  the policy  speech  proposal.  I know wehave  been  commenting  on  these issues  in policy  speeches,  and  I  agree  with  Alice  Rivlin,  EdBoehne,  and  others  who have  talked  about the  context in  which  to describe  our policy  actions.But I am  a lot  more  comfortable  with  policy  speeches  after a move  than before  a move.  I worryabout the  latter.  What are  we doing  here if we  are  going  to telegraph  what we will  be  doingbefore  the fact  rather  than explaining  it after the fact?  I think  we  are better  off if we  avoid  astance where  all  of us are  trying to telegraph  what  we  are doing  before  we  actually  do it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Gramlich.3/31/98

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLICH.  Mr. Chairman,  I  will  support  a no-move,  asymmetric  directive.To  see if I  have  mastered  Fedspeak,  if somebody  had  proposed that  we raise the  fed  funds  rate by25  basis  points,  I  would  have  supported  that, too!  I  am  worried,  as  I  said, that  we could  getourselves  in a  position  of being  too  rigid on the  funds  rate.  I  do not  see that  25  basis points isthat big  a  deal.  It  is not  going to  have  a fundamental  effect  on the boom  or put  a  lot  of workersout  on  the  street.  So,  I think that  a  25  basis point  increase  could  be justified,  but  I will  support  ano-move,  asymmetric  directive.I  do think  we ought to discuss  releasing  the  directive  at the  earliest  opportunity.  Iagree  that if we were  to change  our procedures  now,  it would cause  a lot  of uncertainty  andturbulence,  and there is  no  reason  to do  that.  But we ought to discuss  that issue  as  soon  aspossible.  We  would  be  in  a  little better  shape,  as  Governor Rivlin  suggested,  if we  had aprecedent  for announcing  an  asymmetric  directive  today.  So,  I think  we should  prepare  for thefuture.Let  me  say one  other thing  about  this issue.  I  believe,  Mr. Chairman,  that  when  yougive  policy speeches--and  I read  a  lot of those  before  I  became  a member of the  Board--there  issome  feeling, at  least  I  had it,  that  you  are  speaking for  yourself.  Maybe  that was  naive  on  mypart.  But I think  one  advantage  of getting the  word  out  sooner is  in a  way to take the heat offyou  by indicating  that all  of us  stand behind the policy  or at  least  that the FOMC  stands  behindthe  policy.  In  my view,  that would be  an  advantage  of getting  the word  out  sooner.  So,  I wouldlike  to discuss  that proposal  at  an  early date.  I  wish  we could  do it today.  I  accept  that wecannot,  but  I would  like to see that  change.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Okay.  I  think we have a broad  consensus  around  "B"asymmetric,  so would  you read  the directive.3/31/98

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Excuse me,  Norm.  On that first  sentence  of the  directive,  Mr.Chairman,  one possibility  would  be to  keep essentially  the  words that were  used in the  lastdirective.  It  would say,  after changing  a few  words in that sentence:  "The information  reviewedat this meeting  suggests  that economic  activity continued  to grow  rapidly  during  the earlymonths  of 1998."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  would be  accurate.

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  The wording  of the  operational  paragraph  is  on  page  14  of theBluebook:  "In  the implementation  of policy  for the  immediate  future, the  Committee  seeksconditions  in reserve  markets  consistent  with  maintaining  a federal  funds rate  at  an  average ofaround  5-1/2 percent.  In the  context  of the Committee's  long-run  objectives  for price  stability  andsustainable  economic  growth,  and giving careful  consideration  to economic,  financial,  andmonetary developments,  a somewhat  higher federal  funds rate  would or  a slightly lower  federalfunds rate  might be acceptable  in  the intermeeting  period.  The  contemplated  reserve  conditionsare expected  to be consistent  with  considerable  moderation  in  the  growth  of M2  and M3  overcoming months."
