CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  is  the  first  meeting in  ourrejuvenated Board Room.  The map  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Districts  hasbeen  enhanced but  not  redrawn,  so your Districts  are what  they were;you  need not worry about  that.  However,  as  in  the  old James  Bondmovies,  there  are  a lot of  buttons  here  that  you can't  see.  If  I pushone  in  an  appropriate manner, you  fall  through the  floor  with yourchair, and  there  is  a pool  down  there with sharks  and all  sorts  ofother creatures.  That  is  not meant  to  influence your vote![Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I support  your proposal.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Whatever  it  is!

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Will  this  be part  of  the  transcript  to  bereleased  five  years  from now?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It's  recorded.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't  think  there  is  anything elsethat  has  to be  discussed with respect  to  the  Board Room.  What you  seeis  what you  get.  We will  soon  find out  if  it  is  a major  improvementor just  more  expense.  [Laughter]We have with us  today First Vice  President Colleen  Strandfrom  the  Federal  Reserve Bank of  Minneapolis.  She  is  attending  themeeting  for  the  first  time under  our new procedures.  We welcome her.Would  somebody like  to  move  approval  of  the minutes?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So  moved.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  July 5-6  minutes  have been moved andapproved.  We now  turn  to  Peter  Fisher  for his  report  on  foreigncurrency and domestic  open market  operations  during the period  sincethe July meeting.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Peter,  in  the absence  of  financial  difficultiesin Japan, would the U.S.  Treasury on  its  own have  supported actions  inthe market  to  increase  the  value of  the dollar?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  You're  asking me  to  put myself  inside  theirminds.  I am  a little  squeamish  about  doing that.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I'm not really  asking that.  I am asking whatthe driving  reason was  behind these  interventions.  Why did  the U.S.Treasury perceive  that  there was a problem with  the  foreign exchangevalue  of  the dollar  independent  of  Japan, which  is  what  SecretaryRubin implied  in his  comments  after the  intervention?  Or was  that  a8/22/95way to make  palatable  to  a variety  of  different constituenciessomething  that was  really done more to  help  the Japanese  situation?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't  see  it  as  an  either/or situation.  Ithink the Treasury feels  very strongly  about  the  commitment made  inthe G-7  communique  in  April  that  they were seeking  an orderly  reversalof  previous  exchange  rate moves.  At  that  point,  they were referringto  the  downward movement  of  the dollar  from January through  the  end ofreally mean  that.  I think  the  financial  sector difficulties  in Japanand the weakness  of  the  Japanese economy  are  an additional  reason whythe  Treasury was  concerned about  exchange  rates  when they reachedtheir  lows.  But  I don't  think  it  is  really  an either/or situation.They would  like  to  see  a stronger dollar  and now we have a somewhatstronger dollar,  though  I would note  that  it  is  not yet back to  thelevels  of  mid-January.  I don't  think anyone  thought  the  dollar wasover-valued in mid-January of  1995.  I tried in my remarks  to  berather careful  to  say that  the  dollar  is  off  its  lows  and we have hada big move, but  it  was a bigger move down.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes,  but  there  are two  issues  here.  First,there  is  a sort  of  long-term mindset  about why you  intervene.  Youintervene  to  counteract  disorderly markets,  at  least  that's thereceived wisdom coming  through  the  Fed.  Second, who really knows  theright value  of  the  dollar?  There are winners and  losers  for any valueof  the dollar.  Why would we  support  strengthening  in  the  absence of  areal  rout  that  was damaging  to  the  financial markets?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think  the Treasury  is  looking  at  the  declineof  the  dollar  from January through  the  spring and seeing  that  assomething  that  is  not positive  for U.S.  financial markets  or  theperception of  the U.S.  economy.  It's  really the  time  horizon that  isinvolved here.  You  can think about  disorderly markets  as  a  fifteenminute phenomenon;  you  can  think about  them as  a 24-hour phenomenon;or you can worry about whether  there wasn't  a bit of  an overshoot  on aquarter-by-quarter basis.  I think the  Treasury's  focus  has been moreon  the quarter-by-quarter basis.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  But  it  seems  to me  that  is  a different positionthan  the one  that  I at  least  have been  led to  understand  is  ourposition vis-a-vis  defending the dollar,  to  use  that  old terminology.But  second,  once  the winners  and losers  have been decided  over aperiod of  a week after exchange market instability  settles down,  itlooks  as  if  we are  taking actions well  after the  fact  that  aredetrimental  to  the people  who are  seeing  this  new exchange  rate  levelas  not  really all  that bad.  In  fact,  our  firms  are  more competitivein  foreign markets.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I think  this Treasury has  tried to shy away fromputting it  so pithily.  They  are  trying very hard  to  shake  the  imagethat  there  is  any effort  to  depreciate  ourselves  into  prosperity.  Sothat  would be  their rather direct  rebuttal  to  the point  you aremaking.  They are  trying to  shake  that  image.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It's  just  an  interesting change,  at  least  tome,  in perspective.8/22/95

[SECTION]

MR. SIEGMAN.  President  Minehan,  in  addition the  Treasury hasbeen  seeking opportunities  in market  conditions where  its  interventionwould have  a positive  effect and where it  might ride  a rally where  onewas  already occurring.  So  they piggybacked  on the various  measuresthat  the Japanese  took with regard to  external  investments,  and theycaught  the market  by surprise  on several  occasions.  And  that  turnsout  to  be, for  the moment  at  least,  a little  more effective  than justintervening randomly.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So you  think that  this  is  an--

[SECTION]

MR. SIEGMAN.  They  found an opportune  time.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right,  and are  they going  to  try  to  do  this  afew times  to  prove  the point  that  intervention can be  successful  sothat  when we  have  a disorderly market  and they do  intervene it  works?Is  that  the  logic here?  Or  are  they  seeking  some  particular  foreignexchange value  for the  dollar?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I am not  aware  of  any exchange  rate  target  orparticular objective  other than  the sense  that  the dollar was  a bitlow this  spring.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  say  that  I think  the  Treasurypeople  are  aware  that  they cannot  do  this very much more withoutfalling  into  the  trap, where  they basically areintervening all  the  time  to  no  effect.  My impression is  that  this  isthe  end of  the series.  We have not  been behind the Treasury pushingthem  in  this  direction,  to  say the  least.  They have acknowledged thatthis  is  a risky business  and that  if  they prolong  it  or  try to  do  ittoo  often, the market  will  come back and bite  them.  I don't  thinkthere  is  a newfound insight  that  modest  intervention  of  a  few hundredmillion dollars  or a billion dollars  or whatever can  really move  theaware  that  the only way we  can  effectively change  the  exchange ratethrough intervention  is  to  catch the market  short  against  ourintervention and the  reaction  is  strictly that.  By definition, wecannot  continuously  surprise the market;  at  some  point,  it  is  waitingfor us  to  move and catch us  when we move.  I think there has  been anelement  of  luck  here  that we  should put  in  the bank and  let  it  drawinterest  and not  try to  spend right away.Any  other questions  for Peter?  If  not, would  somebody  liketo move  to  ratify the  foreign  currency transactions  since the  lastmeeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So  moved.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Would  somebody  liketo move to  ratify  the domestic  open market  transactions  since  the  lastmeeting?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Second.8/22/95

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let's now move on  tothe  economic  situation.  Are you going  to use  the big  screens  for yourpresentation?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I'm  not  going to  inaugurate  the  screens.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'm disappointed.  We have  newtechnologies  here  that  enhance  the economic  outlook,  I do believe.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I'm not  sure  the  screens will  enhance  thequality of  the  forecast!

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  More  investment  in producers durable  equipment.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Dave  Stockton has  the  floor.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. SIEGMAN.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for either  gentleman?

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Dave,  you have  some  fiscal  restraint builtinto  your forecast  and you  just indicated--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Excuse me;  may I just  interrupt  for asecond?  Let me request  that  everyone move  their papers  away  from themicrophones,  the  little disks  directly in front  of  you.  I think  thesystem works  fine  provided we don't  block up  the microphone  system.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Your  forecast has  some  fiscal  restraint builtinto  it  and you  also,  as  you  just  indicated, have  a relatively lowerinflation forecast;  and yet  I notice  that  your assumed  long-terminterest rates  remain pretty much at  their current  levels  over  theforecast horizon.  I am a little confused  about  that.  I would haveexpected some  decrease  in  long-term rates.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  The principal  reason we have  relatively flatrates  over  the next  year or  so  is  that  our  forecast  is  basicallybalanced.  We  have  the  occurrence  of  fiscal  restraint.  We also  haveadditional  demand crowding  in  on the  net export  side and relativelywell  maintained private domestic  demand.  In  our  inflation forecast,the underlying picture  is  one  of  flatness,  not one of  moving  lower.So,  the underlying view behind  the interest  rate  forecast  is  ourexpectation of  unchanged  longer-term prospects  for  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Dave,  I would like  to  ask two  questions aboutlabor  force  developments.  As  I am sure  you know,  in the  last year  orso  there  has been a  lot of  volatility  in participation rates and  inparticular a very sharp  decline  in May and a further  decline  in June.I wonder  if  the staff  has  had any  thoughts  about what  is  going  on  interms  of  this  volatility of  participation rates.  Secondly, is  itpossible  that  there  is  somewhat greater  elasticity in  theparticipation rate  such  that  the  current  5.7  percent unemployment rate8/22/95in  labor markets?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  On  the  first part,  we  have been  less puzzledwith respect  to  the volatility in  the participation rate,  which hasoften been volatile  in  the past.  The real question has  been the basicflatness  that  we have  had in participation, even as  labor marketsappeared to  improve considerably.  To  be quite  frank,  I don't  think wehave  very good stories  at  this point;  one  reason is  that with  thechangeover  in  the CPS,  it  has  been very difficult  to  interpret  theaggregate movements  in  the participation rate.  I don't  think we  seeany particular change  in  labor  force  behavior  that would suggest  thatparticipation  is going  to  absorb more  of  the  fluctuations  in  demandand  therefore  leave  the unemployment  rate as  a less  importantindicator  of  labor market slack at  this point.  But  one  can't  rule outthat possibility.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I have  a couple of  questions.  First,  Charlie, onthe  international side:  With regard to  the  other  industrial nations,as  I looked at your projections  I couldn't  discern the  reasons you  areexpecting improvement  in  their  economic  activity.  Is  that  based onthe general  cyclical  notion that  those  economies have been growingslowly,  if  at  all,  so  they are  bound to  do better in  the  future or  isthere  something more  fundamental  going on that  has  led you to  believethey are going  to do better?

[SECTION]

MR. SIEGMAN.  It  is  partly that  the  slowdown  in  the  firsthalf  may well be  an aberration with respect  to  underlying trends andunderlying strength in  those countries.  The German economy felt  someimpact  from the depreciation  of  the mark, which is  now being partiallyreversed.  We anticipate some Japanese policy measures  as  well,although we  have projected a very slow Japanese performance.  So,there  is  a correction  for  the weakness  of  the  first  half  that  we  don'texpect will  continue.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Second question:  I don't  fully understand it,but  I gather  that BEA  is  going to  use the  chain-weighted  index todeflate GDP and that will  lower previous estimates  of  real  GDP,significantly in  some cases.  Does  that  also mean  that productivityestimates  are going  to  come down  significantly?  If  so,  is  thatreally credible?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We have  taken  a look at  trend productivityestimated by using the new Fisher  ideal  chain-weighted index, and thatsuggests  that  the  trend in productivity has  basically been constantsince about  1980.  What  one  sees  as  a pickup in  trend productivityusing 1987-based dollars appears  to be  a statistical  artifact thatarises  from giving much greater weight  in recent years  to  the growthof computers,  and that  tends  to  boost GDP  growth rates.  We  think achain-weighted index is  probably going to  be  a better measure  forjudging  longer-run trends  in  the  economy because it  does not  assumethat  the  relative prices  of  computers  today  are  a good  reflection ofwhat  they were  twenty years ago.  But  it  certainly does  raise  aquestion as  to whether we have witnessed any improvement  in  trend8/22/95productivity.  On many occasions people  have  forecast  or  thought  thattrend productivity was  in  the process  of  improving  only to  bedisappointed  later.  This,  in  some  sense,  is  just  another measure  thatwould suggest  that perhaps  we  can't  be  as  optimistic as  we might havebeen on  the basis  of  the  fixed-weighted index.

[SECTION]

MR. SLIFMAN.  Let me add  just  one  other  comment  that works  inthe  other direction.  There are other  changes  that  BEA  is  consideringimplementing over  the  next  several  years.  One  in particular  thatwould work the  other way would be  the  inclusion  of  software  as  finaloutput.  At present, when software  is  not bundled with  the  computer,it  is  counted  as  an  intermediate product.  If  output of  software hasbeen growing  faster than  other output,  that would push up  "true"output growth.  There  are  some  other  things  that  are  service-relatedwhere  BEA  is  planning to  implement  new procedures  to  try to  get  abetter handle on  service  output,  such  as  this  issue with  software.Those  things won't be  reflected in  the  next benchmark  this  December,but  they will be  reflected in the  following benchmark revision.  Infact,  it may well  be  that productivity is  growing  faster and  that wejust  are not measuring output properly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There is  a major  statistical problem.We  are  all  acutely aware  that  there has  been a  shift  towardincreasingly conceptual  and  impalpable value added  and that  actual GDPin constant  dollars  is  becoming progressively less  visible.  All  ofthese  intellectual  services  have historically tended  to  be written  offas  expenses  in  income  statements,  research and development  clearlybeing the  largest  and most  obvious  of  these.  We  are  moving  toward aneconomy  in which  the value added  is  increasingly software,telecommunications  technologies, and various means  of  conveying valueto people without  the  transference of  a physical  good;  entertainmentis  the  obvious  classical  case.  So, we  are getting  increasing  evidencethat  we probably are  expensing items  that  really  should becapitalized.  This  is  the  issue  with software.  We have  all  seen,  as  Ithink you are  aware,  a number  of  industries  in which  the ratio ofstock market  value to  book value  is  much higher  than one.  In fact,  incertain  industries it  is  a huge  multiple.  The trend of  market  to bookvalue  has been rising very dramatically over  the  years,  and I suspectwe cannot  extract  all  of  that  from changing market  valuations  ofstocks  in general.  What  appears  to  be the  case  is  that  an  increasingamount  of  capital  expenditures  in  the  classic  sense  is  beingmisclassified as  expenses  and that  obviously lowers  the book value  ofthe  firm  to well  below where  it would be  if  those  expenses had moreappropriately been  capitalized.  The  stock market  is  basically tellingus  that  there  has  indeed been an  acceleration of productivity if  oneproperly  incorporates  in  output  that  which the markets  value asoutput.  If  in  effect  there has been  a failure  to  capture  all  theoutput  that  has  been occurring, we will  indeed show productivitygrowth  that  is  too  low.  It  is  hard to  imagine  that  productivity ismoving up  only around 1 percent  under  the new weighting basis  withprofit margins  moving  the  way they are  and with  the widespreadbusiness restructuring that  is  occurring.  I think the  difficulty isnot  in productivity;  I think  it  is  at  the Department  of  Commerce.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Didn't  the previous Greenbook mention a  switchfrom basing productivity on  income  to  basing it  on  expenditures  as  amore realistic way to  assess  productivity because of  the  increase  in8/22/95the  statistical  discrepancy?  Doing that  will  reduce  the  growth ofproductivity.

[SECTION]

MR. SLIFMAN.  Only  in  the most  recent quarters.  Thestatistical  discrepancy doesn't  have  a particular trend  to  it.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Hasn't it  gotten wider  in recent  quarters?

[SECTION]

MR. SLIFMAN.  In  the most  recent  couple of  quarters.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That's  a factor  that  is  going to  work in  the  samedirection  as  the  chain-weighted index.

[SECTION]

MR. SLIFMAN.  I don't  think that's  a trend phenomenon.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Dave, when you outlined the  downside and upsiderisks,  you didn't mention what  I had guessed you would start with,which was  the  fiscal  situation.  If  you were  doing the Greenbookforecast  in  a DRI  framework, which  gives  the majority probabilityforecast,  and, say, your alternatives,  and you  said:  here  is  myforecast  with probability P1  and my forecast  with probability P2,where  P1  and P2  add up  to  about  .3, what would you  say about  thefiscal  situation?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I am not sure  that  we  have any particularpolitical  forecasting  acumen that  could predict how  this  fall's  budgetnegotiations  are going  to unfold.  Obviously, our best  estimate orhighest probability  estimate  is  that  some  agreement  will be  reached  inthe  fourth quarter  that will  avoid the more  dire  fiscal  scenarios  thathave been mentioned.  Clearly,  there  is  a  tremendous amount  ofuncertainty as  to what  actually will  occur.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  What  I am getting at  is  this:  You have  onealternative  forecast  that  has more  fiscal  contraction,  and you  haveanother  that  has  less  fiscal  contraction.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Right.  I would say that  we  are still  showingless  fiscal restraint  in  our  forecast  than  is  embodied in  the budgetresolution passed in Congress.  Therefore,  if  we  end up  with almostexactly what  that budget  resolution  shows,  we probably would showslightly weaker  activity next year  than we  currently are  forecasting.We are  not doing that because  typically, even when these budget  planshave been put on  the  table,  when everything is  added up  in  the  end,  itusually comes out  shy  of  what was  thought when everybody  signed thedeal.  We  felt  comfortable  doing that.  But  I guess  the probability ofa tighter  fiscal  policy than  our  forecast  is  somewhat  higher  than  theprobability of  a looser  fiscal policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  This  gets  back to  Bob  Parry's question  aboutlabor  force  participation  rates and volatility.  One of  the  changesthat  appears  to  have  taken place  in  the  labor market  is  this  greateruse  of  temporary workers  or people  who have less  than permanentattachment  to  the workforce.  I have  two questions  relating  to  this:One,  is  this  in  any way  related to  the volatility that we  were  talking8/22/95about before?  And  second, has  the Board  staff done  any studies  onthis,  particularly in  relation to  whether  this  growth  of  temporaryworkers  affects  the  speed with which  firms  respond  either  inexpansions or  slowdowns  in  terms  of  their  hiring policies?

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  To have  an  effect  on  the participation rate,these contingent workers would have  to  be moved  in  and out  of  thelabor  force.  That  could actually be  occurring;  so  that  could be  afactor in  some  of  the additional  volatility.  I think more typicallyfolks  are  with some  kind of  temporary agency and would probablyconsider  themselves to  be  in  the  labor market most of  the  time.  Buton  the margin,  there  are probably people  who can more easily drop  inand out  of  the  labor  force  given the  kinds  of  opportunites  that  areavailable.  We don't  have  any studies  yet  on whether  this  increasinguse  of  contingent workers  is  fundamentally changing  the dynamics  oflabor  force  participation.  But we  are  acquiring data  to  take  a  lookat  this  issue  of  increasing use of  contingent workers  and temporaryhelp agencies.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  We  have  two  of  those  firms  in  our District.  Weare  working with  them  to  get  some  data  as well.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Our  staff has been working with yours.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Good.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  A quick question:  In your answer  to  one  of  theearlier  questions, you  talked about  inflation flattening out.  Ithought  I read in  the Greenbook  that you were really somewhat moreoptimistic about  inflation  coming down somewhat.  In your projectionsby quarter, you have  a pretty significant  decline.  Yet,  given wherewe are  in  the  cycle  and given where we are  with your projections  onoutput,  that  seemed a little  optimistic  to  me, although  I read yourrationale.  Is  there  one particular reason  why you are  foreseeing theimprovement?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  In  my answer to  President  Forrestal,  I wasthinking more  in  terms  of  the  kind of  long-term inflation expectationsthat  might be  a factor  in determining  long-term interest  rates  ratherthan  the quarterly pattern of  our  inflation forecast, which does havesome  deceleration.  The deceleration  is  from a bulge earlier  this  yearthat  was,  in our  view, related to  some  special  factors  includingsignificant  increases  in  auto  finance  charges  and airfares  that  arenow receding;  it  also  is  related to  the materials prices  and  importprices  that were  rising quite  rapidly but now seem to  be  slowing downsignificantly.  I tried to  convey  in my remarks  that,  indeed,  in  somesense we  have been surprised by how well  labor  costs  have performed ina period when, by our  assessment,  labor markets were tight.  I thinkthat  has  played an  important role  in our  thinking about  the prospectsfor  inflation  and has  underpinned our optimism for  the  outlook overthis  particular horizon.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Just  following up  on  that  question:  I wasstruck by the  fortuitous  timing that you have  in the  Greenbook of  the8/22/95halt,  if  you will,  of  the  one-time--although it  seems  to  be  a longtime--decline  in costs  of  benefits due  to  employer  efforts and  soforth.  I am referring  to  the  coincidence  of  that with our  coming  to  apoint  in  the cycle  where  the unemployment  rate  is  such  that  it  shouldnot be  causing  labor market pressures  and pressures  on prices.  Youdon't  see  an upturn  in  inflation  after  the downward impact  of  the dropin benefits  costs  subsides, which will  occur  sooner  or  later.  Couldyou  talk  a little  about  that  timing?  Obviously, you  think  it  isprobable because  it  is part  of  your  forecast.  How do you  come  to  thatfortuitous  timing?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  It  wasn't  exactly by design  that we  did that.We  reached a point where  the unemployment  rate had dropped  to  the5-1/2  to  5-3/4  percent  level  and we  were  expecting to  see  some  pickupin  compensation inflation.  It  just  has  not occurred.  As  we  indicatedin  the Greenbook, we  don't really  see any reason yet  for  revisingsignificantly  lower  our estimates  of  the natural  rate  in  the  face  ofthat;  in  our view that  would be  giving  too much weight  in  some  senseto  the recent performance.  But  as  this year  has progressed, we havebeen  impressed by the  significant  slowdown  that we saw  in health  carebenefits  costs,  particularly in the  first  quarter.  We  thought  perhapsthat  was just  a  flukey number  and it  was  going to  reverse  itself  or atleast not be  occurring with much  strength in  the  second quarter;  but,it  occurred  again.  The  anecdotal  evidence is  that  some  employersreally are making  significant  efforts  to  make this  adjustment.  Now,which case  the  inflation  outlook beyond our  forecast  horizon wouldremain  relatively benign.  But  as we have  the  forecast  now, we  haveenough  slowdown in  the  economy and inching up  of  the unemployment  rateto  rescue us  from the  possibility of  that  rate  running below  thenatural  rate  for a period  of time  and ever  showing  through  intoprices.  In  some  sense,  it  is  like  having a  favorable supply  shockright  at  the  time when you need it  the most.  That  could be.  Then  thequestion becomes:  Is  it  a permanent  improvement  in  supply  or  is  ittemporary?  In  some  sense  our forecast  doesn't really have  to  comedown  too  firmly on  that  point because  the  forecast  horizon  is  not  longenough  for  the  effect  to  show through.

MS. MINEHAN.  We have  this  discussion once  a month  at  ourdirectors'  table because  our chairman  is  the  president  and chairman ofNew England Medical  Center  and because of  the predominance of  thehealth  care  industry  in  the  First District.  For at  least  the  last  twoyears, we  have  tried to  get  a handle,  both from questioning on  ourside  and from  concerns on his  side,  on how long  business  efforts  tocontrol  costs  will  continue  to  have an  impact  in terms  of  cuttingmedical  costs.  It  just  strikes me  that  they don't have  a handle on  itat  all.  They are being pushed by market  forces  that  have becomeextremely strong and unavoidable, at  least  in  the First  District.  Iassume  that  is  reflected nationwide.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  That  is  just  one  reason  for being somewhatcautious  in looking ahead  and thinking that  somehow  the entire medicalcare problem has  been licked.  There  are  still  some  significant  issuesabout what  is  driving medical  care prices  and whether we are  goingthrough  a transition period where employers  are  able  to  get  a seriesof  one-time  improvements.  It  looked for  a time  as  if  the health  careinflation problems were  behind us.  But  given that  we  have not  solved8/22/95-10-the deeper problems  there,  one suspects  that  at  some point  those  couldcome back again.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions?  If  not,  wouldsomebody like  to  start  the roundtable?  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I will  start  with  theDistrict economy, which remains  relatively strong and actually  showsfewer  signs  of  weakness than  it  did  the  last  time  we met.  This  firmertone  in the  region's  economy  is  evident  across  a wide  range  ofindicators.  The broadest  gauge  of  improvement  is  that  the  District'semployment  levels have  in fact  leveled  off after  some  earlier  declinesthis  spring  and are  up substantially  over a year ago.  Manufacturingremains  sound.  It's not  growing  significantly but  remains  sound, withplants  operating at  relatively high  levels  of  capacity and firmsgenerally  satisfied with  their  inventory levels.  The District'sconstruction industry  shows  signs  of  improving from  this  spring'sslowdown.  We have  seen  some movement  in  contracts  in  the  commercialas  well  as  the  residential side.  Our directors are reportingimproving consumer  confidence and rising retail  sales,  and this  hasbeen  evident  this past July.  Finally,  confirming the  overall  strengthin  the District,  loans at  our banks  have  resumed  growing at  a healthypace after  slowing earlier  in  the  summer.  Indeed, we see  some  signsof  increased deposit  rates  as  loan  and deposit ratios move up,  andthere  seems  to  be a drive  for  increased  funding at  the  banks.There are  a couple  of  weaker spots.  The  energy  industry asyou know continues  to  languish due  to  low prices.  The District's  farmeconomy has  been hurt by a poor wheat  harvest,  especially in  Oklahomaand Kansas,  and by financial  losses  in  the cattle  industry.  Despitethe  overall  strength in  the  economy, wage and price  pressures remainsubdued;  we have  seen only spotty movements  in prices.At  the  national  level,  we  concur with  the general  assessmentthat  the  inventory correction  is  for  the most  part behind us  and thatthe  economy will  be  rebounding as  we go  forward.  Looking out  over  theremainder of  this year and  into  next year,  I anticipate a pickup  inactivity, as  does  the Greenbook,  to  the  2  to  2-1/2 percent  growthrange.  Factors  contributing to  this  pickup are continued  strength  inconsumption and business  fixed investment and a modest turnaround  inresidential construction.On  the  inflation side,  I am not  as  optimistic  as  theGreenbook.  While we are  reasonably confident  that  inflation will  becapped  at  the  3 or  3-1/4 percent  level,  I do not  expect core  inflationto move much below 3 percent,  if  at  all.  With most  measures of  theeconomy still  operating at  or  above capacity and  likely  to  do  so  forsome  time,  I  think the  fundamentals  indicate that  price pressures willremain  firm.  I will  stop with  that  comment.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  For the  most part, Mr. Chairman,  changes  in  ouroutlook  for  the  economy parallel  those  in  the  Greenbook, so  I am goingto  focus my  comments on  developments  in  the Seventh  District.Overall,  it  appears  that District  economic  growth  increased in  theearly  stages  of  the  third quarter.  The  inventory correction thatslowed growth  in  the  second quarter  appears  to be nearing  completion8/22/95in  several  industries,  notably appliances  and steel.  Recent reportsfrom  the  appliances industry point to  a pickup  in  shipments to  dealersand a sizable reduction in  factory inventories.  These  reports werealso  consistent with  increasing production levels  in July and earlysharply  in  the  first  half  of August.  Orders  seemed to  be  flowing  inat  a good  rate.  Customers  had built up  inventories  late  last year  inanticipation of  price  increases,  but  stocks  now seem  to  have  beenworked down  to  more normal  levels.  Most  steel  markets  have  remainedfundamentally healthy,  especially  those  linked to  constructionactivity.In the  automobile  industry, some  progress has  been made  inaddressing  the  inventory overhang, but  the July drop  in  sales may haveraised  some  concern  that  additional  production cutbacks will  beneeded.  Automakers we have  talked to  tend to  attribute  the July dropin  light  vehicle  sales  to  temporary factors  including reduced fleetsales,  shortages  of  some popular models  related to  model  changeovers,and a drop in Japanese  luxury car  sales.  Through the  first  two weeksof  August,  showroom  traffic  is  up  and sales  rates  are  showing markedincreases  over July with reports  ranging  from a 14.6  to  14.8 millionunit  rate  for August;  that's  for  the  first  two weeks.  At  this point,only Chrysler has extensive  incentives on  1995  models, but  at  leastone  other manufacturer is  expected  to  follow  in coming months.Inventories  have not been a problem in  the heavy duty  truck marketwhere production has been at  capacity for  some  time.  However,  therehave  been some  significant  changes  in  this  industry over  the pastmonth  or so.  In June  and July, order cancellations  for heavy  dutytrucks  jumped  to  their highest  levels  since  the  early 1980s.  Incomingorders  have  slowed  somewhat  from  earlier  in the year, but backlogsremain nearly  as  large  as  last year's  record output  level.  Ordercancellations  are  causing production  slots  to  open in  the  fourthquarter  and some producers are  responding by trimming production plansand overtime.  However, major adjustments  to  production schedules  arenot  expected until  early  next year.While reports were mixed,  most retailers  in  the  Districtreported  stronger sales  growth  in June  and July  than earlier  in thesecond quarter.  As  expected, air  conditioner  sales  have been quiterobust,  but  sales gains  in June  and July were  broadly distributedacross  a wide  variety of  durable  goods  categories.  So  far  in August,retailers report  that  hard good  sales  remain  strong but  some  saleshave been hurt by  the hot weather, particularly back-to-school  andfall  fashions as  well  as  home building  and remodeling merchandise.Retail  inventories  generally seem to be  back near desired levels  evenfor apparel  stocks,  and some  retailers  now expect  to be  adding  tostocks  over  the balance  of  1995.  Reports  from  District realtors pointto  a  significant  strengthening  in  existing home  sales  during June  andof  a strong revival  in building  activity, partly due  to  the weatherand partly due to  the remaining  inventory of  new homes  for  sale.Crop conditions  vary widely across  District  states,  withcrops  in  Iowa, Wisconsin,  and Michigan regarded as  above normal  andthose  in  Illinois and  Indiana below normal.  Due  to  late  plantings,the  corn crop  in most  areas  is  not as  far along as  usual,  but warmtemperatures  have permitted some  catch-up.  The hot  weather was not8/22/95beneficial  for poultry and  livestock production, which was  temporarilycurtailed.Labor markets  in  the District  remain  relatively tight,  butslowing  economic  growth  has  tempered demand  for workers.  The averageunemployment  rate  in the  five District  states  has  drifted higher  thisyear, but  it  remains below the  national average  in every state.  Helpwanted advertising in  the region  has  slipped  a bit.  There are  stillareas,  though, within  the District  experiencing  labor  shortages.  OneIowa contact,  for example, noted  that  he needs  to  import workers  fromSouth Dakota  and Missouri.Reports  on prices  have  been mixed but  generally continue  toindicate receding  inflationary pressures, mainly  in  input  prices.Plastic  resin prices  have  actually fallen in  recent months.  Paperprices  are  still  rising,  causing concern  for  catalog retailers  andother District  firms.  However,  the  rate  of  increase in paper  pricesseems  to  be diminishing.  Steel  scrap prices  recently rose,  climbingto  their highest  level  in  four years,  but this  probably reflectsstrong demand  for  scrap-based steels going  into  construction markets.Price  index components  of  the various  District purchasing managers'reports  continued  to move  lower  through July.  Our early receipt  ofthe  Chicago  purchasing managers'  report  for August, which I caution  isconfidential until  it  is  released on August  31st,  indicates  furthermoderation  in price  increases.  The  overall  Chicago  purchasingmanagers'  index  shows  a modest  decline  in manufacturing activity, withthe  index moving down  to  49.3  in  August  from  49.7  in July.  Thank you,Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  economic  growth  in  the TwelfthDistrict  accelerated a bit  in  early summer after  slowing earlier  thisyear.  A pickup  in  California is  evident  from strengthening  retailsales,  faster job  growth, and a falling  unemployment rate.  Employmentgains  have been particularly large  among California's  manufacturers  ofsemiconductors and  other electronic components.  Growth in high-technology  industries also  is  spurring  employment gains  in  the  PacificNorthwest.  In Oregon, much of  the  strength is  also  at manufacturersof  electronic  components and other electronic  equipment.  In  the  stateof  Washington, employment  in  the software  industry continues  to  expandrapidly from a high level.  Farther  inland  in  the District,  economicactivity  in  states  such as  Nevada  and Utah  is  growing fast  andconstruction continues  to  boom.  Excluding  these  fast  growingintermountain  states,  the  District construction  sector had weakened inearly 1995,  but  more recently employment  growth  and residential permitactivity have picked up.Turning  to  the  outlook  for  the  national  economy,  I guess  Ihave  a pretty rosy scenario  in mind, which  is  probably  a good reasonfor  suspicion.  Although real  GDP growth  virtually halted  in  thesecond quarter,  I believe  its  composition bodes  well  for  the  future.The  modest  sustained rate  of  increase  in  final  sales  was  encouraging.In addition, it  seems  clear  that  firms  made progress  in working offthe  inventory overhang that  had built up  in the  first  quarter.  Thisdevelopment  in combination with continued modest  growth in  final  salessets  the  stage  for  resumption of real  GDP growth  in  coming quarters,perhaps  to  the  2  to  2-1/2 percent  range.8/22/95-13-Finally, the  recent  slowdown in  real  GDP growth  should helpnip  in  the  bud  any potential  surge  in  inflation.  It  should helpeliminate  excess  demands  in  labor  and product  markets  that  otherwisemight  have boosted  inflation next year.  In  addition,  our modelsuggests  that  the  so-called speed effects  on  inflation of  swings  inthe  economy will  restrain  inflation, perhaps  by 1/2  percent  in  1996.Overall,  I would expect  to  see  CPI  inflation come  in  at  around 2-3/4percent  next year.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Overall,  the  NewEngland economy can be  characterized as  moving  sideways.  It  is  notmoving up markedly either.  As  in  the past,  there  is  considerablevariation  in  employment  growth  among the  states,  with  the northernstates  down  through Massachusetts  doing much better  than the  RhodeIsland  and Connecticut region.  In fact,  I think I reported  in  thepast  that  Connecticut  had barely  inched out  of  its  recession lows.Actually, even though  the  economy  is  not  doing well  there,  it  is  doingbetter than Rhode  Island, which  is  on a downward  trend.  As  an  offsetto  this,  unemployment  rates in  the  region are  below what  they were  ayear ago,  although  there are  some  labor  force participation  issues  inthis  assessment.  Consumer confidence  has  improved;  price pressuresare modest  overall.  Things  are,  as  I said, moving  sideways.Looking  at  bank lending,  our growth  in bank  loans  had beenbelow that  of  the  nation  as  a whole.  We are now running at  about  thenation's  rate  of  increase.  I think  that  is  more  reflective of  thefact  that  bank  lending nationwide has  slowed and we  have  come intoline with  that.  I don't  think much has  changed  in  the First  District.We  don't have  any  large  firms  anymore  that  drive  the  FirstDistrict  economy.  When you  look at  it,  there  tend to  be  moresimilarities  among  firms  of  roughly equal  size  than  there  are amongfirms  of  different  size  within  similar industry  categories.  Ourlarger  industries  seem to  be  tremendously affected by downsizing, bydefense industry contraction and all  of  that,  and  they tend  to  drivethe headlines  and some  elements  of  consumer confidence.  The smallindustries  tend to  be  where  the growth  in  output  and jobs  isoccurring.  We  get very different  impressions  of  what  is  going on whenwe  look at  the  data, which  tend  to  show relatively  sluggish businessactivity, versus what we pick up anecdotally when we  talk  to  businesspeople.  We have  a small  business advisory  council.  These people  tellus  that New England is  booming.  Now,  it  may be  that  we  selected  theright people  or  the right people  agreed to  join our  council.  They  arefinding it  difficult  to  hire  the workers  that  they need;  they  seeprice pressures that  they can't  pass  on;  they see  a lot  ofcompetition;  they  see more  economic growth than we do  in  the numbersfor  the District  or what  we read in  the newspapers.  The  latterprobably reflect more  of  the  impact  of  the  large  industries.  So, weare  seeing something  that people have  commented on  as  a nationaltrend.  People in New  England like  to  think that  things  happening inNew England precede what  is  going  to happen  in  the nation.  That'sreally  the dominance of  small  industries  in  terms  of  the  economicpattern of  the  District.8/22/95On  the national  side, we  see  the  economy very much  the waythe Greenbook  sees  it.  If  we  were going  to  quibble, we  would quibbleabout  the  optimism on  the external  side and we would quibble  a bitabout  the  downward trend  in the  inflation  forecast.  I personally wasvery happy  to  see  the  revision  in  this  Greenbook versus  the  last  onein  terms  of  the uptick  in GDP  for  the  remainder of  the year.  Wecontinue  to believe  that  there  are  forces  working in  the  economy thatare going  to produce more  growth  than the  Committee  certainly  expectedat  the  last  meeting.  I was  happy to  see  the  Greenbook  reflecting thatthis  time.  In  our view  the  Greenbook forecast--as  you pointed out,Dave--seems  the perfect definition of  a  soft  landing.  This  also  ledus  to  concerns  about where  the  risks are  and the probability of  everlanding where  the Greenbook is  forecasting.  We evaluated  thelikelihood of  that pretty much  the  same way you did.  We were  struck,as  you  seem  to be, by  the apparent  balance  in  those  risks,  even thoughthe risks  are  sizable  on  either side  and  there  isn't  a highprobability of  hitting  the  forecast  on  the head.  So,  we would assessthe balancing  of  the risks  the  same way you  do,  and I think  that  isprobably enough  to  say prior to  our policy discussion.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Most  of  the  recentanecdotal  and statistical  information  suggests  that  economic  growth  isresuming in the  Philadelphia  District.  Manufacturing, which has beena major  drag, appears  to  be bottoming out  and  the outlook  is  positive.Retailers  report the  usual  summer  slowdown, but  the underlying  trendis  favorable  and retailers  are  upbeat  about  the fall.  Bankerscontinue to  report that  consumer  lending  is  rising.  Auto dealers  aremaintaining positive  sales  trends,  although extensive  incentives  areunderpinning the  sales  rate.  Residential  sales  have picked  up  inresponse  to  falling mortgage rates  as  well  as  effective pricereductions by builders.  There  are  some  indications  that  the  pricingof  office buildings may be  firming, although prices  are  low andvacancy rates  are only  steady at high  levels.  The  employmentsituation is  mixed, with  the  jobless  rate  still  high in parts  ofsouthern New Jersey  and the  old industrial  and mining regions  ofPennsylvania.  Other parts  of  Pennsylvania and Delaware  have  tighterlabor markets.  Wage and price pressures  remain contained.On the  national  level,  the  inventory adjustment  appears  to beproceeding reasonably well.  Final  demand appears  to be holding up  andinflationary pressures appear  to  be  subsiding.  There are  always  risksto  any outlook  as has  been pointed out,  and  there can always  besurprises.  At  this point,  however,  the outlook  is  favorable  forsustainable growth and  further progress  toward reducing inflation overtime.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman,  after  a brief pause  earlier  inthe year,  the  expansion in  the Sixth  District has  resumed.  We  seebroad-based  growth  continuing for  some  time  to  come  and  this  is  partlydue to  continued migration  to  the  region.  This  is  a trend  that  showsvery  little signs  of  abating, and  it  is  supporting economicperformance  that  I suspect  is  stronger  than  in  the  nation as  a whole.Our contacts  in  the District,  including our directors,  report  thatretail  sales  rebounded in  July.  Apparel  is  doing  fairly well and8/22/95-15-household  items,  particularly those  relating  to home  sales,  are doingwell  also.  The  exception  is  auto  sales,  which are mixed.Manufacturers  have begun using  incentives  to  clear  out  end-of-yearmodels.  Tourism has  improved markedly  in  comparison to  last year.The  increasing publicity being given to  the  Olympic games  in 1996  isgenerating  interest  generally throughout the  District, but perhapsmore  importantly there has  been a return of  European visitors  toFlorida.Our manufacturing survey released just  about  a week  agoshowed gains  in  output but not  gains  in  shipments during July.  As  aresult of  this,  inventories  of  finished goods  appear to  have risen,but the  expectational  elements  in  that  survey were quite  positive.Business has  been particularly strong  for manufacturers  ofelectronics,  medical  equipment,  and heavy duty  trucks.  Weakness  againis  evident  in  autos  and related goods  as  well  as  the  District'sapparel  and textile plants,  which continue  to  suffer  from importcompetition.  Defense  is  also  weak in  the  District.  Sales  of  paperand paper products  have been good, but  industry representativesexpress concern about  prospects  for the  continuation of  that  goodgrowth.Sales  of  single-family homes  improved  in  July and rose  tolevels above  those  of  a year ago  in many areas.  Inventories  of  homesfor sale  appear  tight  at  the moment;  and new home  construction, whilerising, is  still somewhat below  last year's  level.  Multifamilythe rest  of  the  country.  Occupancy and rental  rates  are  rising,although this  is  probably going  to be  moderated  in  1996  by new unitscoming on  line.  Commercial construction  is  also  doing quite well  andwe  are beginning  to  see  some  speculative office  and industrialprojects  coming on  line.  Again related to  the  Olympics, we  are  seeinga lot  of  building activity, particularly  in Atlanta.On the  banking side,  bankers  are reporting moderate growth  inloan demand and very, very  strong competition.  That  competitionunfortunately is  reflected  in credit  terms  as  well  as  in price.Business  loans  have been moderate  so  far  this  year, but  the demandseems  to  be decelerating.  Consumer  loans  are mixed  and lenders  aresomewhat disappointed with the  demand  for refinancing.Wage  pressures  in  the District  remain  in  check, almostthroughout  the  District.  Skilled workers  are  still  in  high demand  ina  few places,  but reports  of  labor  shortages have  diminished quite alot  in  the  last  few months.  Product prices  also  seem  to be  in  checkwith  the  exception  of  some pressure  in  the pulp and paper and  thechemical  sectors.With respect  to  the  national  economy, our forecast  is  veryclose  to  the  Greenbook for  the balance  of  this  year, but we  do  show alittle  greater  strength and somewhat more  inflation.  Our  forecastdoes not  have any adjustment  for  fiscal policy changes,  so  I believethe  differences between our  two  forecasts  are  consistent.  I thinkthat  the  outlook is  reasonably good  for  continued growth and moderateinflation.  But  with the uncertainty surrounding  fiscal policy andwith  the continued softness  in  the  economies  of  our  trading partnersabroad, there  is  some  risk of  deviation from both  of  those  forecasts.8/22/95-16-But  at  this point,  I think  the risks  are  about  balanced.  Thank you,Mr.  Chairman.

MR. MCTEER.  The  Eleventh District  continues  to  show modestoverall  growth with  a noticeable  flattening of  employment  growth  inNew Mexico  and Louisiana being offset  by slightly improving employmentin Texas.  High-tech  industries  like  electronics,  semiconductors,computers,  and communications  services,  which are  increasinglyimportant  in  the  Eleventh District,  continue  to  be  an  important  sourceof  regional  growth.  Our contacts  in  real  estate are  voicing a renewedsense  of  optimism particularly in  single-family construction, which  isbelieved to  finally have hit bottom.  However, we  are beginning  tohear of  some  fears  of  overbuilding of  apartments,  particularly in theDallas area,  and banks  in the  District have  indicated that  concernsabout  apartment  overbuilding have  led  them  to  tighten  standards  forapartment construction loans.  Retail  sales  have  improved  somewhat  inmost parts of  the  Eleventh District  in recent months,  with the  notableexception of  the  cities  along the Mexican border  where  conditionscontinue  to deteriorate.  Most  of  our peso-sensitive manufacturingindustries  have been  showing  flat  or declining employment, withelectronics and  electronic equipment  as  I previously mentioned beingthe exception.  Electronics have benefitted  from strong worldwidedemand, and our  contacts  have  indicated that prices  have  been  fallingat  a slower rate  than  previously, which has  added  somewhat  toinflationary pressures.  We  continue  to  hear  scattered reports  oftight  labor markets  but  little  about wage pressures.On  the national  scene, we  really  have no  significant quibbleswith  the Greenbook.  The only bit  of  inside information I have  toshare with you  is  that  up  through  the middle  of  August,  sales  ofnationwide have  been weaker than  expected.  They havemaintained unit  sales,  but have done  so  only by cutting prices.  Theweakest  areas  are  in the Northeast  and the  Southwest.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  At  our board meeting a couple of  weeks  ago,Mr.  Chairman, one  of  our directors  summed up his  comments  on the  localeconomic  situation by saying  that  things  were not as  good as  they hadbeen, presumably back  in  1994,  but  they were better  than most peoplehad  expected when the  economy began  to  slow earlier  this  year.  Ithink that  remark  fairly characterizes  the general  sentiment  not onlyin his  area but pretty much across  our whole District.  I read  thatremark as  offering some  confirmation  for your remark  in  your Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony that  we may be  past  the  point of  maximum risk in  theslowdown.  I think it  offers  some  support  for  the  staff  forecast--something  like  that!  [Laughter]There  really has  not been much change  in  conditions  overallin our  region  since the  last FOMC meeting.  The economy  in theDistrict  continues  to  grow at  a subdued pace,  but  it  is  growing.  As  Ihave mentioned at previous  meetings,  we still  have  some pockets ofvery strong  activity, especially  in  central  North Carolina.  To alarge  extent  that  is  because  a number  of  businesses  from other partsof  the  country have been relocating recently to  that  area.  In  any8/22/95-17-case, we  have been told  that  the market  for office  space  is  extremelytight  in places  like  Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte  and that  the  supplyof  both skilled and unskilled  labor  is  quite  tight  in  that  region.The South  Carolina and Virginia  economies  for the most  part  are  alsopretty  strong, and even West Virginia  is  doing pretty well  overall,  Ithink  in part because  of  some  relocations  from other  parts of  thecountry.The main problem in  our  District  I guess  is  the opposite  fromyour  situation, Cathy.  The  northern part  of  our area,  the Marylandeconomy, is  quite  sluggish  and,  of  course,  the general  economicsituation here  in  the  District  of  Columbia  is  very bleak because  ofcurrent  and prospective job  losses.  One  anecdotal  comment we  heardmight be  of  some  interest.  We  are  in  touch with an  automobile dealerin Maryland who is  active not  only  in  his  own market  but  in one  of  thenational  dealers associations  and he gets  good information about  theindustry generally.  He  told us  recently  that  auto  dealers  had beensurprised and burned  three  times  so  far  this  year--in January, April,and now July.  Because  of  that  he  thinks  that  dealers  are  going toapproach  the new model  year with considerable  caution and  only orderthe minimum number  of  cars, what  they need to  represent  the new modelsto  the public.  If  that  turns  out  to  be right,  it  could offer  someconfirmation to  your projection, Dave,  that  the cutback  in assembliesGDP  growth in  that period.More  generally, the  staff's near-term projections  for  thenational  economy are  certainly  reasonable.  They seem to me  to  beclosely  in  line with  the private consensus projections.  Like mostother people, I think  the risks  are pretty balanced on  the up  side  andthe  down  side.  Back  in  the  spring,  as you may  recall,  we  in  Richmondwere especially concerned about  the downside  risks  in  the  outlook.  Weare  less concerned about  them now, but  I think we need to  keep  in mindthat  they  are still  there.  It  seems  to  me  the key  is  the  automobilesector.  If  the weakness  we have  seen in  auto  sales were  to  persist,that  could extend the period  of  slow  job growth, revive concerns  aboutjob  security, and put  a lid on aggregate  demand.  But  there  are alsoupside  risks,  and I think they are  more pronounced now than  they wereearlier this  year with  the strengthening  in  the  economy that  seems  tobe suggested by some  of  the recent  data.  The  main upside  risk as  Isee  it  is  that  once  we  get  past  the  inventory correction, assuming nounanticipated negative  shocks,  the  economy  could be operating at  closeto  full  capacity in  a number  of  key  industries  and labor markets.  Inthat  kind of  situation with a recession having been dodged, people mayhave  an enhanced view of  job security.  If  we  were to  get  a  situationlike  that,  the  favorable wage  picture  that we  have been  looking at  ina period of  relatively low unemployment could begin to  dissipate.  Therecent upward  adjustment in bond rates may be  reflecting  that  kind ofconcern at  least  to  some  extent and maybe  to  a considerable extent.

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  As  in  the nation as  a whole,  theEighth District  has  experienced some  slowing relative  to  1994.  Thatwas  expected because  the  District economy had  been growing  faster  thancould be  sustained.  The District unemployment  rate was  4.7  percent  inRecent  reports  show growth  in  personal  incomes  in District states8/22/95-18-centered  in  the  4 to  5 percent  range.  Job growth has  continued,though  at  a slower pace.  Conversations with our  directors  and otherDistrict business  leaders  indicate  that  the  District  is  generallyoperating  at  a high  level.  In  fact,  forecasts  of  reduced autoproduction at  the national  level  are not reflected  in the  EighthDistrict.  The models  produced in  our District  are popular,  and  theauto  companies  are  expanding  capacity.  Third-quarter motor vehicleproduction is  expected to  be  3.6 percent  above  the  level  in  the  secondquarter  and 13.8 percent  above  the  level  in  the  third quarter of  lastyear.  Loan demand  continues  to  be strong,  and District banks  haveincreased  loan portfolios by  about  15  percent  over the  last  year.There has  been an  increase  in  the  issuance of  building permits,suggesting  that  the District  is  sharing  in  the  nationwide rebound  inthe  demand for housing.  Many of  the business  people I have met  havereported pockets  of  labor shortages,  especially for  entry-levelworkers but  for  some  skilled workers  as  well.  Nonetheless,  as  othershave mentioned, the  labor market  information has been mixed.  On  theone  hand,  there have been some  suggestions that  wage pressures  arecontinuing  to  build.  On  the other,  there has  been a moderatereduction of  both overtime and employment  of  temporary workers.I remain  concerned  about  the  outlook  for inflation  and ourinflation credibility.  When I  look at  the  pattern of  inflationexpectations--for example,  there  is  a table  on CPI  inflationexpectations  in part  II  of  the  Greenbook  that  I think is  quiteinteresting--I see  that  expectations  for  future  inflation continue  toexceed current  inflation.  Even  the Administration's mid-sessionreview of  the  1996 budget  assumes  that  consumer price  inflation willcontinue  in excess  of  3 percent  through  the year  2005.  This  month  theBlue Chip consensus  reported expectations  that  the CPI  would rise  3.3percent  at  an annual rate  in  the  third quarter, 3.4  percent  in  thefourth quarter,  and 3.4  percent  in  1996,  fourth  quarter over  fourthquarter.  It  is  clear  that  the prevalent  view is  that  inflation willcontinue  in the  3 to  4 percent  range, which  is  less  optimistic  thanthe view expressed by the  staff.  Even  the  lower bound of  a 3 to  4percent  inflation range  is  certainly not price  stability as  I see  it.I am  also worried  that  we,  as  well as  the  financial press  andothers,  are  focusing too  much on news  reports about  real  economicactivity.  By continually  focusing on  labor market  reports,  factoryorders,  consumer  sentiment  surveys, and other  real  series,  weundermine our  position that  the  best policy  to promote  long-termgrowth and  full  employment  is  to  achieve and maintain price  stability.Our words  lose  their  force  when we  act  on uncertain news about realactivity in the  presence of  expectations  for  inflation as  high as  theyare.  The  decline  in bond prices  since July 6, which Al  mentioned aminute  ago,  indicates  that  not  everyone expects  that  the modestacceleration in  inflation that  has  occurred this  past year will becapped and  that  inflation will  turn down.  All  said,  I am  concernedabout  actual  inflation and  the high  level  of  inflation expectationsthat  are  embedded in  forecasts  and  in  longer-term interest rates.

MR. JORDAN.  A general  characterization of  the Districteconomy,  I would say,  is  the  feeling  that  it  is  as  good as  it  gets.Certainly  for  the state  of  Ohio  and  for  the  part  of  Kentucky  in  ourDistrict, people would  say  that these  are  the best times  that  anyone8/22/95-19-can  recall,  and they would have a hard time  imagining it  improvingover  that.  That would not be  the case  in  western Pennsylvania wherewe have  a number  of  counties  that  are  still  considered to  have highunemployment and  sluggish growth.  But  I think  the  sense  of  optimismand confidence about  the  future  is  really  extraordinary.  Yet,  I don'tsee  it  being accompanied by the kind of  imbalances  or  any kind ofexcesses  or  speculation that would worry me.  The mood  I get  from oursmall  business  advisory  council,  our  small  bank advisory council,  ourboard of  directors,  and the  business people  that  I talk  to  is  one  of  acalm confidence  that  this  is  sustainable.  Near  term, Cleveland  inparticular  is  looking  forward  to  the  Rock and Roll  Hall  of  Fameopening on  Labor Day.  They consider  it  to  be  a bigger event  than theAtlanta Olympics  [Laughter]  followed very shortly by the  all-OhioWorld Series.  [Laughter]  We  have been sold out  of  baseball  seats  forover  a month now;  it  is  really extraordinary.

MS. MINEHAN.  We  take  exception to  the  idea  of  an  all-OhioWorld Series.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  The  industry- and  sector-specific  comments  thatwe  hear would not be  significantly  different  from  what Mike Moskow  isreporting from the  Great  Lakes region.  So,  I am not  going  to  gothrough  them.  But  I will  relay a couple  of  anecdotal  reports  of  noterelated  to motor vehicles  and specifically  trucks.  One directorcommented that  he  had  seen a very welcome  reduction in the  amount  ofovertime.  With some  relief,  the  companies--auto  suppliers andassemblers--feel  that  they will have  fewer problems  with  labor nowthat  they are able to  cut back  on the  amount  of  overtime.  Talking  tobusiness people  about  their efforts  at hiring,  it  has been veryinteresting  to  hear  their comments  about  the  lack of  what  they callunskilled workers  and how much  they are  having  to pay  in  order  toattract  unskilled people  for  entry-level  positions.  One  company thatmakes rubber products  related  to motor  vehicles  said that  the nicething about  today's  technology is  that  they can hire people who don'tknow anything  at all  and still  afford to pay them  $8 an hour eventhough they are  unskilled  in his  view.  This  says  that  there issomething about  the productivity of  these people  that  is  notconsistent with usual  notions  about productivity.  If  he  thinks  theyhave  no  skills  and yet they are worth  $8 an  hour because  oftechnology,  that  is  a different way of  thinking about what  the  laborColumbus  area  said that people  who are not working  today  in that  areaare people who don't  want  to  work.  Bonuses  are being paid and  firmsare  competing  for  unskilled or trainable workers.  Another generalcomment  from directors  and advisory people  is  how much they arespending on training and how they achieve  better  results  by competingfor  workers  by offering training programs  rather  than  by raisingbenefits  or bidding up  the wage  structure.With regard  to health  care,  some  of  our directors  in  thatindustry--including health goods  and other health-related activitiessuch  as  a managed  care  company  in  the  Dayton  area that  is  adding newmembers at  double-digit  rates--describe  an  industry that  is  so  grosslymismanaged that  any organization, even  one  like  the  Post  Office,  couldimprove  the administration of  hospitals  and clinics.  I asked them howlong  the  opportunities  for  improvement  can  go on,  and they said  theintroduction  of  better administration  and technology could take  untilwell  into  the  next  century.8/22/95Turning  to  the national  economy,  the  productivity numbersthat  we see have  interested me  for some  time.  Early this  year or  latelast  year,  I saw Board staff  projections  of  productivity that  Ithought were  simply  too  low.  But  since  I also don't  think that  theoutput numbers mean much,  it's  hard for me  to  get  too concerned  aboutthe productivity numbers.  The  fact  that  those numbers  areconsistently coming  in  so  much  stronger than people expected may  tellus  something  about  the different  nature  of  this expansion.  That  is,it  is  not  a demand-led expansion  fostered by monetary and  fiscalstimulus, but rather  it  is  the  dividend  from a gradual  improvement  inthe  credibility of  our commitment  to  price  stability so  that peopleare putting more  into  those  things  that  improve efficiency or what  wewould call productivity.  To  test  that  idea,  I have  been askingdirectors  and advisory council  members whether,  if  they were told  thatthey could not  increase their prices  for  the  rest of  this  century,  thecost  increases  they would have  to  incur--labor,  benefits, rawmaterials,  and so  on--would put  them out  of  business.  Almost  all  say,yes,  we can  make it.  But  some  go  so  far as  to  say that  such a priceoutlook  is  the  reality. said  that  heis  operating above capacity but  he  has  not had a price  increase  in  twoyears.  I asked him why he  didn't raise his  prices.  He  said it  isimpossible  to  do  so;  he can  rely on rising productivity.  He  isincreasing his work  force and  training  it,  and he  is  addingtechnology.  I believe we have made  a  lot  of progress  on what  I thinkof  as  the  issue  of  inflation--people's  ability to  compensate  for  costincreases without  raising output prices.  We  are seeing  the benefitsof  that  in  rising  standards  of  living.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The District  economyremains  healthy and activity  generally has picked up  over  the summer.That pickup  has  been reasonably widespread across  industries andregions  of  the District.  There have been  some  further gains  inemployment.  At  the  same  time,  labor  does  remain  in  relatively scarcesupply.  That  combination is  interesting because  it  still  has  nottranslated  into  anything  resembling a broad-based-acceleration ofwages  or even  growing wage pressures.  One  interesting anecdotebearing  on  this--and I would not argue  that  this  is  a widespreaddevelopment at this  point--came  from a  fairly  large employer  in ourDistrict who  indicated that he  was  having a lot  of  trouble  findingworkers.  He  said he  has  gone  to  outsourcing  some  of  his  back officeactivities;  he  has  contracted with a  firm in  Maine  to  do  some  of  thiswork.  Apparently,  labor  is  more readily available  there  and he  canget  the work done at  a reasonable  rate.  As  I  said, I am notsuggesting that  such outsourcing  is  widespread, but we may see more  ofit  as  time  goes  on.One  exception  to  this  general  picture  of economic  health isthe  livestock  industry;  a second  is  manufacturing.  For whateverreason,  manufacturers  in  our  District  feel  business  is  soft  and theyare  not optimistic.  They believe  they are  going  to  be  cutting outputfurther  for some  time.  I think  that's  a reasonable generalization  oftheir views.With regard  to  the national  economy,  I am certainly  ingeneral  agreement  with  the contours  of  the Greenbook  foreast.  Themajor surprise  to  me  has  been  that  things  seem  to  be working out  so8/22/95well,  and certainly a bit better  than  I might have  expected a month  ortwo  ago.  I think we  are moving  toward a foundation  for a resumptionof  sound economic  growth.  I anticipate  that wage  and price pressureswill remain  relatively restrained.  That  is  based  in part  on what  Isee  going on  in  the economy  in  terms  of  the difficulty of  raisingprices  and  the  reluctance  to  raise wages  or other  forms  ofcompensation.  I don't  see  anything  that  is  going  to come  along soonto  disturb  that.  So,  I think we  are  in pretty good shape.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr.  Chairman, I want  to  take  up GovernorBlinder's  question and  Dave Stockton's  answer regarding the  risks  infiscal policy.  This  should not  surprise you  at  all because  fiscalpolicy is  what  I have  talked  about  all year.  I would like  to  startoff  with two  observations.  The  first  has  to  do  with the  level  ofdeficit  reduction we are  talking  about.  Now, there  are a  lot  of  waysof  looking at  budgets,  and  the word baseline  has  a  lot  of  meanings.  Ilike  to  think  of baseline  as  being what we would  be  spending  if  weadjusted  for inflation  and demographic  changes without  changing  thelaw.  That  number  is  $20  billion higher  than  the  baseline  that  thestaff  is  using.  So,  when  the Greenbook refers  to  a  $30  billiondeficit  reduction  from  the  baseline, we  are  really  talking  about  a  $50billion reduction  from what  I think of  as  a current  services baseline.When we  talk  about  the House  and Senate budget resolutions,  which havea  $50  billion budget  deficit  reduction, we  are  really  talking  about  a$70  billion reduction.  These are  numbers  that  we  have  to  keep  in mindbecause we  are  talking about  more  "real" money  than we might  think, touse Senator  Dirksen's phrase.  Second, when we  look back at  this,  Ithink we  are  going to  be  happy that  the  second-quarter pause happenedin  the  second quarter  and not  in  the  fourth  quarter or  the  firstquarter of  1996  because  I think  the  fiscal  contraction we  are  going  tohave  coupled with random events such  as  an  inventory correction, ifthose happen  coincidentally, would  lead  to much worse problems  than wethought.  I agree with Dave  Stockton  that we  don't have  any particularexpertise  on  the  fiscal  side.  I don't  think  anyone has  any realinsight  into  how  this process  is  going  to  work out.  But  I decided  tobe  cynical  about  it.  I decided that  our  elected representatives mayhave  something on  their minds  other  than purely  the national  interest.So  I talked to pollsters  and political advisers of  both parties,actually most  of  them  are  independent.  I asked them  for  some pollnumbers  so  that  you could  see  exactly what  they are  seeing  and you  canmake  your  judgments  accordingly.The  first  thing you  hear when talking  to  anyone  is  theimportance  of  Perot  voters.  One  only had to  watch  the  parade  toDallas  to understand how important  they are.  So,  I am going  to  focuson  Perot  voters.  They have  been called the  radical  center--I  don'tknow if  that's  the  right phrase.  Demographically,  they are moremiddle  class  than  most voters:  37  percent  of  them had  incomes  in  the$40,000  to  $80,000  range versus  28  percent  for all  voters.  They arealso  less  religious  than other  voters;  47  percent  admitted not goingto  church at  least  monthly versus 38  percent  of  all  other voters,  andthe percent  of voters  that  go weekly was  well below  that  for thegeneral  public.  Those  are  important characteristics  to  keep  in  mind.They are  also decidedly more anti-government  than Republican voters,and this  is  where  it  becomes  interesting.  When asked if  the  federalgovernment has  too much power,  Democrats  thought  yes,  63  to  24;8/22/95-22-Republicans  said yes,  79  to  17;  Perot  voters replied yes,  88  to  9.  Apre  Ruby Ridge question was:  Would you actively  resist  the governmentif  you  thought  it  was  threatening your  rights?  "Actively resist"  is  apretty strong phrase.  Perot  voters  said yes,  57  to  34.  Do you  thinkthe  government  is  your partner or your  opponent in  your pursuit  of  theAmerican dream?  Perot  voters  said  it  was  their  opponent,  71  to  23.Does  government hurt  or help  people  like  you?  Democrats  split  aboutevenly.  Republicans  said  "hurt,"  50  to  36,  and Perot voters  said"hurt,"  51  to  24.  How about  the  welfare  state?  There were  twochoices:  government is  there  to  take  care  of  people  who  can't takecare  of  themselves;  or  groups  like  the  Salvation Army and/or  theUnited Way would do  a better  job.  Democrats  like  the  government,  48to  39;  Republicans  like  the private  sector,  61  to  25;  Perot  voterslike  the private  sector,  67  to  18.  Do we  even need the  federalgovernment to  provide  a social  safety net?  Democrats said yes,  53  to33;  Republicans  said no,  60  to  36;  Perot voters  said no,  68  to  24.In all  these questions,  the  Perot voters  are to  the  right  ofthe  Republican voters.  They are even more so  in  the case  ofregulations.  Do  regulations cause significant  job  losses?  Perotvoters  agreed,  71  to  24,  more  than  the Republicans.  Does  it  increasethe  cost  of  things  we  buy?  The Perot  voters  said  yes,  83  to  12,  morethan among  the Republicans.  And this  is  something that  maybe  the  Fedshould  keep  in mind:  How much  trust  do you have  in regulators  to  actin the  interest  of  most Americans?  The  split was  a great deal  or  afair  amount versus  not very much or none.  Among Perot  voters  thelargest  category was none,  and they were  negative,  54  to  16.  On  thekey spending  issue  of Medicare,  the  choice was:  Would you want  totinker--to which most people  said yes--leave  it  alone,  or  completelyredesign.  The public  in  general  split  21/20  on  leaving  alone versuscompletely redesigning.  Perot  voters  were  for completely redesigning,30  to  14.  When given  the  choice of  reforming Medicare  to  controlcosts  or using money allocated  for  tax  cuts  for  the  rich to maintainthe  current Medicare system,  they split  3 to  1  in  favor  of  reform  overusing tax cuts  for  the rich.  Those are the numbers  that  theRepublicans  in Congress  in particular  are  focusing on  since  thesevoters  are the  ones  that  gave  them  the majority.  Perot voters  in  1992split  evenly  among the parties;  they went  2 to  1 for  the  Republicansin  the  last  election.The  first  conclusion of  the pollsters and  analysts  is  thatthe  Republicans think  they have  to  deliver  on budget  cuts  to  keepthese voters.  The  second is  that  the  decline  in  the Republicannumbers  since  January is  more a result  of  the budget-cutting processslowing down  than  their  doing the wrong thing.  Independents,  forexample,  were asked whether  Congress was  stalling or  going too  fast.They said  stalling, by 43  to  30.  Third, GOP  freshmen are by  far  themost Perot-like.  Secretary Rubin spoke  to  the  freshman class  to  tryto  talk  them out  of  not  approving the  debt  ceiling.  He  came  awayshocked;  that was  the word  I was given.  There  are now 160  members  ofthe House  of  Representatives  who have  signed  their names  to  somethingthat  says  they will not  raise  the  debt ceiling  unless  there  is  abalanced budget  resolution with it.  People  in  both parties gave me  aflat prediction  that  a debt  ceiling bill  will not pass  the House  ofRepresentatives  unless  there  is  also a balanced budget  resolution togo with  it.  Fourth,  specific bureaucratic  cuts  are not going  to  bereduced.  They are,  as  the  numbers  suggested, even more popular amongPerot  voters  than among Republican voters.  Finally,  shutting down  the8/22/95government  is  perceived as  posing very  little  risk.  You might  get  asense of  that  by looking at  the vote  on  the bill  to  limit  theauthority  to  use  the  Exchange  Stabilization  Fund that  the  House  passedby over  100  votes.The  Democrats'  constituency  is  best  served by saying  thatthere  is  no problem, and that  is  in  fact  the  case.  Remember,  theDemocrats we  are  talking  about  are  the  survivors  and they don't  needto  go  after  the  Perot  voters.  Gephardt  says  that  there  is  no problem,for example,  on Medicare  and he  is  in  fact  angry that  the  Presidentsaid there was.  When  you  look  at  the  Democratic voters,  you get  asense  that  they really have  to  hold their base  if  they are  going to  bere-elected.  For example,  47  percent  of  the  attendees  of  the  lastDemocratic national  convention were  government employees.  The  largestgroup of  those were  teachers.  As  a result  there  is  an incentive  notto  cooperate  in  the  process,  which  is  going to  be  important both atthe beginning and at  the end.What we  should expect  in  September,  I was told  by thepundits,  is  a series  of  filibusters  in the  Senate  over  theappropriations bills.  If  the  Senate  cannot act  and we  don't haveappropriations bills,  the  President  can blame  the Congress,  and  thatis  the opening  for him.  I was  told that  one  of  the  reasons  forBradley's defection was  that  he became  so  fed up with this  mess.  WhatClinton  is  hoping  to  do  is  not  so much get  the Perot  voters  as  to  havethem not like  the Republicans.  The way to  do  that  is  to  have  Congressnot produce  the appropriations  bills,  and that  is  the  strategy.  Thepath of  least  resistance, according  to  the party  leaders  I talk  to,  isto  have  something  like  the GOP  level  of  budget  cuts  because  they arenot going to  get  anything else  through  the  House.  But  to  achievepresidential  victories  on  issues  such as  abortion, where we alreadyhave  seen some,  especially if  Medicare  cuts  are  incorporated  into  theprocess,  the  President may have  to  compromise with the  Republicans andget  the Democrats  in  the Congress  to  go  along.  They would not.  Thefinal  result  may be  that  a bill will  have  a lot  of  difficulty passingbecause  there  is  no bipartisan  support  for  a compromise.  The  finalcaution  in  all  this  is  that  if  a reconcilation bill  is  vetoed, allthe deals  that were  cut  in  getting  the  appropriations process  arenullified.  You have to  start  the process  all  over  again.  A veto  ofthe  reconciliation bill  probably means  that  it  is  going to  take weeksand weeks and weeks  and not  a matter of  hours  or  days  to  get  a seconddeal  through.  All  that makes  me very depressed, but  it  seems  to  methat we are probably going to  get  much larger  deficit  reductions  inthe  form of  spending  cuts  than  the Greenbook  is  calling  for,  and  Ithink  that  should be  a factor  in  our  thinking.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Therecently released data  show no  clear-cut  trend  in  the  SecondDistrict's economy.  In  the  real  estate sector,  our  contacts reportedYork City metropolitan  area in  July and August  to  date.  In June,permits  for  construction  of  single-family houses  in  the  District fellbelow year-ago  levels  for the  fourth consecutive month.  Unemploymentrates  rose  in both New York and New Jersey in July, but  the payrollreports  were mixed.  New Jersey reported moderate, broad-based jobgrowth while New York reported  a contraction reflecting a decline  in8/22/95-24-government employment.  On the more  positive  side,  tax collection datasuggested some  underlying strength in personal  income  and retailsales.The  considerable  concern and pessimism regarding theinternational  situation that  I mentioned at  the  last  Committee meetinghas  been  lessened but  only a  little.  It  has  been lessened  slightlybecause  the  Japanese  have made  some  rather  modest  steps  to  encourageeconomic  growth  and a more  rational  flow of  capital  from  theirfinancial  institutions.  Much more  needs to  be  done,  however.European growth  is  weak as  demonstrated especially by recent Germandata.  In  our own hemisphere,  the major countries--Mexico, Brazil,Argentina, and Canada--are working  through very difficult macro-economic  situations,  and that  is  likely to  continue.  So, we  need  tocontinue to  look at  the United States  domestic  economy against  thebackground of  a  rather weak international  environment.I view the movements  in  exchange  rates  since  our  last meetingas  positive  in  that  the  dollar was weaker  than  it  needed  to  be to  makethe United  States a very formidable  exporter, and the  strength  of  theJapanese yen was  a major  source  of  concern,  then and now, about  thebasic  financial stability of  that  country, especially  its  bankingsector.  But  I think the present  exchange rate  levels,  given thecurrent  fundamentals,  are  more  rational and more likely  to  lead toeconomic growth  in Japan  and Germany.  And as  I said earlier,  Ibelieve the  United States  dollar  is  still  at  a  level  that  makes usquite attractive.  I think  that  all  or most  of  these  exchange  ratemoves would  have happened if  we  had not  intervened.  As  Peter Fisherand others  have  suggested,  the  success of  the  intervention had  a greatdeal  to  do with  the  fact  that  the  market was moving in  that  directionanyway.  You never know whether all  of  this would  have happened  if  wehad  just  stayed home  and relaxed, but  it  is  important  that we  not getconfused into  thinking  that we  can have  exchange rates  where we wouldlike  them  to be  rather  than  where market  forces  say they will  be.  Icertainly support  the Chairman's wish  to have  everybody decide  that  itis  nice  that we  were successful;  we  were lucky three  times;  and nowlet's  cool  it.Domestically, we  think, as  all  of  you  have  suggested, thatthe economy  is  bouncing back very much  along the  lines  that  we andothers  have  been forecasting  for  the  last  several  months.  We  thinkthe  downside  risk has  been reduced considerably and that  the  risks  tothe  forecast are now  rather well balanced.  Signs  of  strength:Single-family  housing starts  are  up  11  percent  in  May and June;nonauto  retail  sales  are  strong;  consumer confidence  is  strong;  andthe stock market  is  quite  robust.  On  the  other hand, auto  sales  areweak and,  as  has been  suggested, could continue  to  have an  adverseeffect  on  the  economy  in  the  fourth quarter.  Employment  is  growingbut not very  strongly.  Our  forecast  and the  Greenbook's are verysimilar  in  terms  of  real  GDP  and the unemployment  rate.  We  areslightly  less  sanguine  on  inflation but just  slightly  less.  We hadbeen considerably more  concerned or at  least we had a higher  forecastof  inflation  than did  the Greenbook until now;  we  have been  revisingour inflation  forecast  down.  I think  it's  easy to  get  confused abouthow much better  the price  data  look  because used car prices  early inthe year pushed core  inflation higher  than it  should have  been and arenow making  core  inflation  look  a little  too  good.  If  you  take  car8/22/95-25prices  out of  core  inflation, it  slows  from  around 3-1/2  percent  inthe  first  quarter  to  about  3 percent  in July.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Prices  for both.  I really  applaudthe  approach of  the Greenbook.  I think we have  to be  careful,especially in  New York, not  to  fight  the  tape  and to  accept the  factthat  price performance  is  in  fact better  than we had  thought  it  wouldbe.  On  the other  hand, it's  a little  early to  declare  victory, andtherefore  I applaud  the decision  of  the  authors  of  the Greenbook notto  say  that  the NAIRU  is  coming down  from  the  5.9  percent  level.  Ithink it  would be  very nice  if  we  could conclude  sometime  in  thefuture  that  that has  happened, but  I believe  it  is  smart  not  to  reachthat  conclusion quite yet.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  There  is  no  doubt  thatthe  Greenbook is  not exactly correct.  It  never  is;  it  can't be  andit's  not expected  to be.  But  that  said,  I think the  staff did anexceptionally good job  this  time  around  in  assessing what  I see  as  avery  tricky period.  I find  the economy  that  they project  to  be  highlycredible.  I also  think that  it's  a very acceptable  one  at  this  timebut not  permanently.  By not permanently  I mean that  over  the  longerterm we  still  have  to  keep  the  inflation rate  on a secular downwardpath.  We are  not  at  price  level  stability yet,  and we  are  stilldetermined to  get  there.What  do  I mean by acceptable at  this  time?  Well,  I thinkthere  are many very big questions  out  there whose  answers  are going  tohave  to unfold  over  the coming months.  Virtually  every one  on my listhas  been  discussed this  morning, and it's  rather awesome.  After  allthe  rhetoric  runs  its  course,  what  is  really going to  be  the  deficitreduction  that we  are  going  to  have  to  deal  with?  Second, has  theNAIRU  changed and if  so  by how much?  Third, have productivity trendsreally  improved as  many think?  If  we are  on  a higher  trend, how muchhigher  and is  it  a sustainable  one?  Fourth,  a lot  of  the  good resultsthat we  are  getting now,  I don't  know how much, has  to  do with the  so-called  traumatized worker.  How long  is  the  American workforce goingto  remain quiescent without  the  compensation increases  that  it  thinksit  should get?  When employment  is  as  strong  as  it  is  right now, Idon't  think we  can  depend on having permanently favorable  results  inthat  area.  This  has  been a rather big key  to  the present  happy macrosituation  where we  have  a high  capacity utilization rate and arelatively  low  inflation rate.  We  all  feel  rather good  about  that.Fifth, will households  continue  to  take  on more debt?  That  obviouslyis  the  key to  consumer spending.  Consumer debt  is  rising  again  towardits  all-time  high  of  several  years  ago.  We all  know that  in  many pastyears we had a much  lower  level  of  consumer debt  than we are  carryingnow.  One  has  to  wonder  if  people  are  going to  want  to  return,  atleast  partially, to  those  standards of  prior years.  Then, of  course,there  is  the  matter  of  whether or  not we  are  overstating  inflation andif  so  by how much.  That was  a very interesting but not  particularlycritical  question when we were  at  higher  levels  of  inflation, but aswe begin  to move  into  the  zone  that  could be  considered price  levelstability,  that  question starts  to  become very  important  indeed.8/22/95-26-The answers  to all  these questions,  and more  I am sure,  aregoing  to  have  everything  to  do  with shaping  monetary policy  as  we  goalong  into  the  future.  How  is  it  going  to  shape  up?  I certainlydon't  know, but  the point  is  that  for now  it  seems  to  me  that we  havea good balance  in  the  economy and we  are moving  toward an appropriatedegree  of momentum.  That puts  us  in  good  shape  to  await  the  unfoldinganswers  to  some  of  these  critical  questions  and  in  a pretty goodposition, I would hope,  to  be  able  to  react  appropriately as  thoseanswers  start  to become  available.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  inventorycorrection appears  to  be  running  its  course  and the  adverse  follow-oneffects  that we  talked about  at  the  last  meeting do  not appear  to  beabout  to beset us.  The economy  could well  be  set  to  resume  its  growthpath at  potential.  Many of  the  areas  of  strength in  the  economy havebeen mentioned.  Both  consumer  and business  spending have  resumed.The housing market  has  shown some  renewed vigor.  Employment  still  isfairly strong,  although  the  unemployment rate  did tick up  last monthand  there has  been  some  discussion about  the  volatility of  theparticipation rates.  The wealth  effects  of  a stronger  stock marketwell  for  continued investment  spending.  Corporate profits  have  beenholding up  reasonably well,  and there  appears  to be  a continuedcommitment  to  improvement  in productivity.In  view of  this  rather optimistic  scenario,  I have  beentrying  to  assess  the downside risks,  the  clouds  and uncertainties  onthe horizon.  Larry has  talked  extensively about  the  fiscal  impact  onthe  economy of  dealing with the  deficit, particularly since  it  appearsthat  there  is  considerable  interest  in seriously addressing it  thisfall.  It's  very hard to  know what,  if  any, effects  there will  be  froma  train wreck.  I think we'll  see  a  lot  of  national  attention  focusedon Washington as  we  approach  the  November showdown.There  also has been considerable  discussion today about  thelabor market.  Although  the unemployment rate  is  historically low, itis  difficult  to  assess  the  longer-term  impacts  of  the  re-engineeringbinge  that  has been going on  in  the private  sector  and in  some partsof  the public  sector.  A  lot  of  displaced people  are now employed, butthey may see  their new jobs  as  temporary.  On the positive  side,  thisdoes  suggest  that  there may be more  flexibility in  the  labor marketthan  is  implied  by the  5.7  percent  unemployment rate.  This  may helpexplain the  dichotomy  that we  seem to  be  seeing  between  laborshortages  and the  fact  that  there  don't  seem  to be many upward wagepressures.  This uncertainty  in  the  labor market  or lack  of  confidenceamong workers  may well  contribute  to  consumer  spending vulnerability.This  vulnerability may be  exacerbated by  the  fact  that  a lot  ofconsumers have  taken on more debt  in  the  last year and a half.  On  thesupply side,  the  auto market may not provide  the  same kind of growthimpetus  that  it  has  in  the past.  We have heard  some mixed reportsaround  the  table  today about  the  auto market.  Pent-up  demand hasprobably been worked  off.  The  ownership holding period  for  autosappears  to  be  longer.  Some of  that  is  due  to  the  improved  durabilityof  autos,  but  it  also  may be  simply  that people  can't  afford thehigher  sticker prices.  Income  constraints may  start  to  hold down auto8/22/95-27-sales  in  the  future  and not  provide  the  same  kind of  impulse  that  wehave  had  in  the  past.  Of  course,  foreign  competition may become moreof  a  factor as  the  impact of  the  dollar  is  felt.On  the  inflation  side,  I do  think that  most  of  the recentdata  are  supportive  of  the hypothesis  advanced at  the  last meetingthat  the  uptick  in  the  first  half  of  the year  was really  due  totemporary cyclical  pressures.  It  is  somewhat  discouraging  that  theoutlook  for  inflation still  seems  to be  in  the vicinity of  3 percent,indicating that  we have  some  distance  to  go.In  sum,  the  economic  reports  that  have  come  in  since  the  lastmeeting  have been encouraging.  The  inventory correction appears  tohave been more the proverbial  air pocket  on the way to  the  softlanding.  The  financial markets  seem reasonably  consistent with thisoutlook.  The stock market  has  paused but  it  didn't  tank.  The  slopeof  the yield  curve has  steepened,  implying  that  the  risk of  recessionis  somewhat  less.  Yield spreads  have not widened,  implying that  thereCredit demand appears  reasonably strong.  So,  it  seems  to  me  that  agrowth outlook reasonably close  to potential  is  quite  likely and thatthe  risks  are more  balanced.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  After  all  the praisethat  the  staff  forecast has  received, I am  tempted  to  start  by sayingthat  I think  they  have  it  all wrong.  But  I don't  actually, so  Iwon't.  I don't  have any major  quarrels with  the Greenbook.  I coulddiffer with it  a  little bit here  and there,  but  those differences  aretoo  small  to  bother  anybody with.  Like many people,  starting withDave  Stockton,  I am  troubled by  the  fact  that  it's  a bit  too  good tobe  true.  We  know  it's  not  going to  come in  quite  that well,  but  thatis  in no  sense a criticism  of  the  forecast;  you make your  best guess.A notable  feature  of  the Greenbook  forecast  exercise, whichvarious people  have  indirectly remarked upon but  I'd  like  to  makeexplicit,  is  that  we have been  seeing a successive writing down  of  thestaff  forecast  as  I have observed at  past meetings.  That  has nowstopped.  I think the  staff  has  stopped writing  down  its  forecast,  asI have,  for  good  reasons.  Bob  Parry mentioned  several of  them,  and Iwon't  repeat what  he  said about  the  composition of  the GDP  in  thesecond quarter;  that's  much more  important  than the  tea  leaves  that  weget  from week  to week.However, as  you could probably tell  from the  question that  Iposed to  Dave,  I have  some  fear  that  all  of  us  are  going  to berevising  our  forecasts  down again  after  the  fiscal  dust  settles,whenever it  settles.  We  don't know what  the dust  is  going  to  looklike, and we  don't know when it  is  going  to  settle.  But  when I thinkabout  the various  scenarios,  I have  a much harder  time  thinking aboutthe  economy coming out better  at  the  end, or  in  the middle,  of  theprocess  than  I do about  it  coming  out worse.  I just  find  it  extremelydifficult  to  conceptualize a scenario  that  takes  us  through  this  trainwreck and has  us  coming out  on  the  other  side  with  stronger aggregatedemand  than we had when we  went  in.  There are  two reasons  for that.One  is  the  aggregate demand  effect, which  Larry Lindsey wasemphasizing.  But we  also  ought  not  to  forget  about  the potential8/22/95impact  of  this  thing, whatever  it  is,  on  financial markets.  Theforeign  exchange markets,  the  domestic bond market, and  the  stockus  can predict  what  is  going  to  happen.  I am  just  emphasizing  thisbecause  I think it  now ought  to  be at  the  front  of  our  screens,  not  atthe back.  Two or  three FOMC  meetings  ago  it  was  at  the  back of  ourscreens,  and now I think  it  really needs  to  be  at  the  front.The last  thing  I'd  like  to  call  attention to  is  a subtle,barely noticeable,  feature  of  the  Greenbook forecast.  You have  tolook closely to  see  it.  But  I think  it's  important  for the  long run--not at  all  important  for  the  short run--and also  sensible.  In thisforecast,  there  is  a small  GDP gap at  the  forecast horizon, whichhappens  to  be  the  fourth quarter  of  1996.  GDP is  below potential  byjust  a hair more  than  it  is  now, according  to  the  staff's  estimates.It's  not a very big  gap,  about  .4 percent  of  GDP.  That's  a  smallnumber, much  less  than  forecasting errors  for a six-quarter horizon.But  it's  also  about  twice  the  estimate of  the overshoot  of  capacitythat  we had  at  the  end of  1994  and  the beginning  of  1995,  which wasminute.  Much more  important  for  the  long run--and the reason  I bringit  up--is  that,  if  we  look  at  the  details  of  the  forecast,  that  gap  isslowly widening over  time.  That  is  to  say, GDP is  growing  just a  tadbelow potential.  If  we  extrapolated that  path  into  1997  and  1998--after all,  year-end  1996  is  a very short  time  horizon for monetarypolicy--we would be  looking at  a path with a  slight upward  tilt  to  theunemployment  rate and  a slight  downward tilt  to  the  inflation rate,neither of  which  is  showing yet  in  the  Greenbook  forecast.  They gotogether,  of  course.I said I thought  this  was  a sensible,  though  very subtle,feature  of  the  forecast.  It's  exactly what one  would expect  if  thereal  interest  rate  is  above  the  equilibrium real  interest  rate--which,I think,  is  what  we believed at  the  last  FOMC meeting  and what  I stillbelieve.  If  that  is  the case,  the  gap between potential  and actualGDP,  or between  the natural  rate  and the  unemployment rate,  or between3 percent  and the  inflation rate,  will  grow bigger  as  we go  forward--and at  an  accelerating rate  since  this  thing  feeds  on  itself.Finally,  I think there  is  a reasonable  probability that  thegap between  the equilibrium rate  and  the  real  short-term interest  rateimplied  in  the Greenbook path is  bigger  than  in  the Greenbook  forecastfor two  reasons,  both  of  which have been mentioned.  One  is  that  thefiscal  contraction is  bigger  than  in  the Greenbook path and  thatlowers  the equilibrium  rate.  The  other  is  the possibility that  theNAIRU is  actually below the number  that  is  being  used in  theGreenbook, as  has been mentioned  several  times.  We  don't  know thatthat  is  the  case.  Dave  is  absolutely right;  I was quite  happy withthe  way he  characterized  it.  But  I think the  odds  that  the  NAIRU ishigher  than the  staff  number  look extremely small  compared to  the  oddsthat  it  is  lower.  If  that's  the case,  the divergence between  theequilibrium real  rate and  the  actual  real  rate  will  grow faster  thanan extrapolation  of  the  Greenbook would presume.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I think  the news  thathas  accumulated during  the  intermeeting period  is  almost  entirelyfavorable with  respect  to  the  outlook, both  for real  performance  and8/22/95-29-for  inflation over  the  forecast  horizon.  While  I,  too, would like  tofind  a reason  to  disagree with the  Greenbook,  I  find myself  insubstantial  agreement  with the Greenbook's  assessment  of  the data.Most  important  to  my way  of  thinking  is  that  we  now have  mountingevidence  that  the  inventory adjustment under way is  proceeding morerapidly and with substantially  less  disruption of  growth  in  finalsales  than  I had been  fearing.  The  continued strength of  consumptionand investment  spending  in  the  face  of  the  inventory adjustment,coupled with  strong evidence  of  a rebound  in  residential construction,substantially mitigates  what  I had  thought was  one  of  the most  seriousdownside risks.  At  this  stage,  as  David emphasized, substantial  risksto  the outlook  for real  growth remain,  but  I agree that  they are muchmore  balanced than  they seemed  to  me  in July.  As  David alsoindicated,  it's possible  to  argue  that  there  remains  enough momentumin aggregate  demand  to  potentially rekindle  inflationary pressures.In that  regard,  I would simply point  out  that we  have  had asignificant backup  in  interest  rates  since our  last meeting,  coupledwith a significant  appreciation of  the dollar.  I think  that  those  twoforces  are working  to  restrain  this  upside risk.At our  last meeting, Mr. Chairman, you  argued  that  thepresent  level  of  the  real  funds  rate  is  above  the neutral  orequilibrium  level  that  is  needed for  stable  growth with a continuingsecular  downtrend in  the rate  of  inflation.  The  Bluebook  for the  Julymeeting  reinforced  the conclusion  that,  particularly with projectedfiscal  contraction,  this  neutral  real  funds  rate would be  declininggradually  over  time.  I certainly agreed with that  conclusion then  andI continue,  as  Governor Blinder  emphasized,  to  think that  eventuallythe real  funds  rate  is  going to  need  to  decline  to  keep  the economy ontrack beyond  the  forecast  horizon.  I agree  with Governor Blinder'sexplanation  that  if  we  were  to  go beyond  the  six quarters in  theGreenbook, we would  see  initially a mild  shortfall  in  growth belowwhat  is  needed  to  keep the  economy operating at  potential  and then  thegap would begin  to widen.  It's  in  that  sense  that  a decline  in  thereal  funds  rate  is  eventually going  to  be needed  to  keep  the  economyon  track.  Nevertheless,  over  the  forecast  horizon  I think that  theoutlook has  definitely improved.On  the  inflation  front,  the  news  has  also  been quitefavorable.  Recent readings  on producer and  consumer prices  along withthe appreciation of  the  dollar have  lessened the  concern  that  theuptick  in inflation  that  we  saw in  the  first  half  of  the  year  couldpresage  a higher  inflation  trend.  And  as  David Stockton  emphasized,the  continued moderation  in  the growth  of benefit  costs  andcompensation  is  a favorable  factor  in  the  inflation outlook.  It  maybe  too  soon to break  out  the  champagne, but  it  seems  quite  likely tome  that we will  succeed  in  capping  the  inflation rate  in  this  cycleand preserving the  gains  that  have been made  on  the  inflation  front  inthe  1991  recession and the  ensuing recovery.

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  it  turns  out,  mycomments  begin where  the  last  two  commentors  left  off.  I'll beorganizing my comments  this  morning around  the real  federal  fundsrate.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there a particular reason why you usea  one-year forward  expectation of  the price  index deflator withovernight  funds?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  First  of  all,  I don't  know what  the  overnightinflation expectation is.  To make a guess  about  inflation over  theshort  run, it's pretty  reasonable  to  assume  that  people would look  atinflation  in  the  recent past,  so  we use  a one-year backward-lookinginflation measure.  It  does not give  a  significantly different  resultfrom  the  Philadelphia Fed's  one-year  ahead  inflation measure.  Wedon't have any  shorter measure  of  inflation  expectations.  I do  thinkthat  if  folks  are  trying  to  guess  at  what  inflation is  going  to  beover  the next  few months,  those  guesses  are not  all  that  differentfrom  their guesses  about  inflation over  the next  year or whatinflation was  over  the  last year.  But  I'd be  the  first  to  admit  thatour  measures  of  expectations are highly  imperfect.  I took  a littlecomfort  from the  fact  that  both the  backward-looking and  the  forward-looking measures  gave  roughly the  same  answers, though  I think theforward-looking measures  are--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Except  now, if  you use  a two-  or  three-month moving  average, won't you get  virtually a full  percentage pointhigher?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  A  full  percentage point?  I guess  if  you use  thethree-month moving average.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  has  the  inflation  rate been  in  thelast  three months?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  I would say 2-3/4  percent  if  I were going  toguess.  This  has  3.1  percent built  in.  I am  using  the  last  12  months.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I understand that.  You are not  usingthe  core  rate;  you are  using  the  total  CPI,  is  that  right?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  The  total  CPI  has  averaged about  .2 a monthfor  the  last  three months.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That's  closer to  a 2-1/2  percent  rate,  so  it  wouldbe  about  1/2  point perhaps.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any other  questions  for Don?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Suppose your  objective was  to maintain  nominalGDP in calendar  1996,  and  suppose on November 7th we got  protracted,torturous messes  on  Capitol  Hill  and in  the bond market.  Suppose wegot  a contraction of  government  spending  somewhere around  3/4  percentof  GDP, and again  it  was messy in  the bond market.  Which  would bemore  effective  as  far as  influencing nominal  GDP  in 1996:  to  have a8/22/95-31-sharp  cut  in  the fed  funds  rate  at  that  time  or  to have  gradualreductions  leading up  to  it?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The premise  of  the  question  is  that  somehow on agiven day you knew  the  size  of  the  shock  and it was  huge relative  toGDP.  So  there was no  uncertainty going  forward about how  long  theshock would persist  and what  its  size  would be.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  The  issue  is  resolved on  that  date.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  My  first  thought  is  that  if  the  issue  is  resolved,you know what  the resolution  is  and where things  are going,  andeverybody else  knows--this  isn't  some  inside  information the  Fed has--I don't  know why you wouldn't  reduce your  rates  right away rather  thangradually.  I'm not  sure  I see  the  advantage of  gradualism in  the caseof  an  identified shock whose effects  I am quite  confident  that  I know,provided that  the rest  of  the world sees  the situation  the  same  way sothey don't  misinterpret your  policy actions.  Governor Blinder  wasshaking his  head  "no."

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I thought  the question was whether  to  move inadvance.  Isn't  that what  you  just  said, Larry?  You  got  the rightanswer but not  to  the question  that you  asked.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  If  I knew now that  this was  going to  happen--isthat  the question?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  If  you  knew now  that  this was  going to  happenand the  objective was  the  same.  Maybe, Governor Blinder, you  can helpme  out  in  phrasing my question.  You are  right;  I don't  think  Donanswered my question.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Am  I grading  these papers?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  No,  I'd  rather he grade  the papers.  If  thatwas what  was going to  happen, would  it  be more  useful  to wait  untilthe  event  and have  a sharp reduction  on that  day or  to  have areduction  sooner  than  the  event?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  If  I knew what  was  going  to  happen but  the marketsdidn't?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  That's  the key because,  as  I think Mr. Simpsondemonstrated last  time,  if  the markets  know what will  happen  they willtake  bond yields down  and that  acts  basically as  an  automaticstabilizer.  It  doesn't matter quite  so  much how  the Fed validates  it.Eventually you have  to validate  it,  but  the  timing of  our moves  is  notso  important.  If  you knew today that  there was  going to  be a majorcontraction beginning  on November  7th, you would have  to  proceedsomewhat gingerly because  there would be  a problem if  the marketsdidn't  know it.  They wouldn't  know how to  interpret what you weredoing  even if  you stated what  you were  doing.  If  they didn't believeyou, there  could be  a potentially  adverse effect  on  inflationexpectations  or  a lot  of  confusion and volatility in  the markets.  So,you have  set  up a very difficult problem where  the  central bank doeshave  inside  information, while  the rest  of  the economy doesn't  have  it8/22/95-32-and might or  might not believe  the  central bank if  it  provided thatinside  information.  So,  I think you would have  to proceed verycautiously  in  that  kind of  situation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Just  a quick  comment  and a quick question.The comment  is  that  I noticed some  changes  in  the  way the  Bluebook wasconstructed and the way you presented some  of  the  information, which  Ithought was  useful and  constructive, Don.  The question  I had:  Wehave had a  significant backup  in  long-term  interest  rates  over  theintermeeting period, 35  basis points  at  the  long  end of  the yieldcurve.  There  wasn't  a whole  lot of  discussion about  that.  Iinterpret  that  backup  as  being  in part,  and maybe  largely, a change  ininflation  expectations  and psychology  in  the market,  albeit a short-term one.  It's  hard  for me  to  see how real  rates  would move  thatquickly.  Much of  this  took place  in a very short period  of  time--shortly after  the  data began  to  come  in  stronger.  Do  you  see  it  thatway?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I would  say, President  Broaddus,  that  I see  it  asmuch more of  a mixture, perhaps  with a  little more emphasis  on  thereal rates  but not exclusively  the real  rates.  That  is,  I think theinformation  that  hit  us  and the market  over the  intermeeting periodwas  that  real  growth  was stronger at  those  old interest  rates  than  wehad been  expecting.  In  classroom jargon,  the  IS  curve was  out  a bitfurther  than we  thought.  That  to  me would  suggest  that  in  fact  realinterest  rates need  to be  higher  over  the business  cycle  to  keep  theeconomy at  its  potential.  If  you look  at  the pattern of  forwardrates,  a lot  of  the  bulge in  forward rates  over the  intermeetingperiod  is  at  business  cycle  frequencies  of  three,  four,  five years.At  the  same  time,  I think we  probably can never  settle  this  because wedon't have  inflation-indexed bonds.  Given  that  the  economy wasstronger,  I think  it's  logical  that  inflation expectations might havebeen revised up  at  least  a little, but  I would put much more emphasison  the  real  side  than on  inflation  expectations.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Don,  first  of  all  I wanted  to  comment  that  Ireally appreciated  the remarks  you made with  respect  to  the Bluebook.I must  say  that  I read  the discussion  of  real  rates  in  the  Bluebookand got  a headache!  I think what  really both red me  about  it  is  thatI view real rates,  like  any other  real  variables,  as  something wecan't  influence  in  the  long run as  well  as  something  that we can'tobserve.  So  we are  describing policy actions  in  terms  of  something wecan't  affect  and something we  can't  see.  That's why I got  theheadache.  Now,  there  is  an  easy  solution to  that:  get  inflation downto  zero,  keep  it  there,  and we  won't have  to  worry about  it.  We  havejust  cut  short  rates  25  basis points  and have  seen  long-term nominalrates go up  35  to  40  basis points.  In  that  light  I was  going to  note,particularly with regard to  a policy option  such  as  alternative A,that  it  is  incomprehensible to  me  that  we somehow  could cut  shortrates again based  on our  forecast  of  inflation, which  the marketdoesn't  know about,  and keep real  interest  rates  in general  fromrising,  let  alone  foster  lower real  rates.  This  is  very  similar  tothe  example you were giving  in  response  to  Larry's  question.  TheGreenbook  inflation  forecast  is  not  supported by most  other forecasts8/22/95and many  surveys  of  longer-term expectations.  Real  rates,  as  yousuggested in  your remarks,  are  a helpful  thing  to  look at  over  longerperiods  of  time,  but  I don't  know what  to  make  of  the  analysis  of  ashort-run policy  option based on what would happen  to  real  rates,particularly to  real  rates  across  the yield  curve.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I don't  think  I can help your headache.  [Laughter]I can  try  to  explain what  I was  thinking about.  I think  that  theFederal Reserve  can  affect real  rates  by changing  the  federal  fundsrate,  real  and nominal,  since  the  two  are  about  the  same  becauseinflation expectations  don't  change  in  the near  term.  I thinkexpectations  about what  the  Fed will  do with  interest  rates  do have  aneffect  on real  rates,  at  least  through  the  intermediate  part  of  theterm structure.  I believe  that's  the  primary channel  of  FederalReserve  policy to  the  economy.  In 1979,  1980,  1981  this  institutionraised  real  rates  to  very, very high levels  and had a major effect  oneconomic  activity.  Those real  rates  rose  at  short-  and  long-termmaturities  in order  to put  slack  in  the  economy  and reduce  inflation.So,  I think  the  Federal Reserve  can affect real  rates,  at  least  over  abusiness  cycle.  I agree  that  in  the  long  run productivity and thriftdetermine the  long-run  real  interest rate.  The premise  of  our meetinghere and making policy changes  is  that  in  the  short  run we can affectreal  rates  and lean  against  business cycles.  Perhaps we  don't  do  aperfect  job  all  the time,  but  I think the  evidence of  the  last  15years  shows  that we  have  done a pretty good  job on at  least  a fewoccasions  in  smoothing  through  these  cycles  by changing real  rates.With regard  to  alternative A,  I believe  that  if  you were  tolower  the nominal  funds  rate, you  would have an  effect  on realinterest rates  at  least  through  the  intermediate-maturity spectrum.People would change  their  idea  of  what  this Committee was  going to  dowith  interest rates.  What would happen  to nominal  rates  is  a biggerquestion and one  that  we  debated amongst  ourselves  in  writing  thatparticular paragraph.  That  is,  if  our policy was  not credible,  ifpeople  thought  that  lowering  these  interest  rates would simply provokemore inflation, then nominal  intermediate- and  long-term rates mightvery well  do  nothing,  in  which  case  the  inflation expectations  partwould rise  even though  the  real  rate was  lower,  or  these nominal  ratesmight  even rise.  My view  in  the  end was  that  the  FOMC has  a  lot  ofcredibility and that  if  the  Committee  lowered rates  and in particularif  you  said that  you lowered  rates  because  you had an  optimistic viewon  inflation,  that would  carry some  weight  in  the market  at  least  fora while.  If  I remember  the paragraph,  it  would  only be  if  theincoming data  failed to  confirm  the  Committee's  expectations  thatrates would  then back up.  But  I agree  it's  entirely a guess  as  towhere  inflation  expectations will  come out  if  you do  that.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I thought  it particularly difficult  in  thecontext  of  our most  recent  experience  to make  that  argument.  Let mejust  leave  it  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Tom, there  is  no  question that  you areright  on the  longer-term rate spectrum, but  if  hypothetically we  justsqueezed reserves  out  of  the  system, two  things  would happen:  Thenominal  rate  would go  up  and  the  inflation  rate would go  down, and thereal  rate would have  to  go up.  But  I think  that  is  not  true  in  thelonger run, which is  where we  can't  affect  it.8/22/95-34-

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  It's  not  true  in  the  longer run.  I get  troubledwhen we  start  extending that  out  the  yield curve  and making judgmentsas  to  how  it  affects  the  long  end of  the  curve.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think it  is  not  true  in the  long run,and  it  is  not  true  in  a long-term  forecast  of  the  real  funds  rate,  ifI may put  it  that  way.  But  for a  short-term forecast  of  the  realfunds  rate,  I think Don  is  exactly right  on  that.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  In  terms  of  the  funds  rate, yes.  What  troublesme  is  going out  the yield curve  and making a general  application.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Or  a long-term projection  of  the  realovernight rate--in  other words, what  the  funds  rate  is  going  to bethree  years  or  ten years  from  now.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Sure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Don,  I want  to  ask you a question  that came  upwhen  I scribbled my notes  last  night,  notes which were much  lessextensive than yours.  I was  thinking  about  the  difference between thereal  Treasury bill  rate,  or  any interest  rate that  really matters  tosomebody, and  the  real  fed  funds  rate,  which doesn't  matter  to  anybodybut us  and a  few banks  that  trade  fed funds.  If  I am not  mistaken,when we  looked at  this  a while back,  it  was  somewhat puzzling  thatnominal  fed  funds  rates  were higher  than Treasury bill  rates  onaverage  over  long  periods  of  time.  Is  that  right?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes,  but  there are  two  differences.  One  is  thetaxation.  Treasury bills  aren't  subject  to  state  income  tax.  Peopleoften use a New York resident  as  the  marginal holder,  so  it's  anontrivial  tax rate  like  10  percent.  The  second point  is  that  one  isthe  obligation of  someone who hasn't  defaulted--at  least  until  a  fewweeks  from  now--and the other  is  a private  rate.  There  is  a  differentrisk premium.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Different  risk?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Sure.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes,  but  that  goes  the other  way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Fed  funds  rates  are higher  than bill  rates becausebanks  are  riskier  than the government.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I am  sorry.  Am I right  that  the  average  gapover  a very long  time  is  in  the range  of  75  basis points  with fedfunds  higher?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That's  too high.8/22/95-35-

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That  sounds  too  high to  me as well.  Dave  issaying 50  basis points.  In  the Financial  Indicators package  there  isa one-year real  funds  rate;  I don't  know whether  that's  helpful  interms  of  the point you are  getting  at.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  He's  talking about  the  two nominal  effectiveyield  curves?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes.  The  difference  is  about  30  basis points  nowand  it  looks  like  the  average may be  about  50  to  75  basis  points.  Itwas  low for  a long time.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  What  I was getting at  is  this:  On  the  questionof  the  real  rate  relative  to historic  averages,  I think you  get  alittle  stronger  case  that  it's  on the  high  side if  you  look at,  say,Treasury bills.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Treasury bills?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think  that's more  correct  than  if you  look  atfunds.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I will  have  it plotted and distributed  to  theCommittee.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Anything else?  At  the  last  meeting andat  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony, as  Governor  Yellen  suggested, Iindicated  that  the maximum risk  of  a short-term recession was probablypast.  Indeed, the  data that  have  emerged  since  then have  increasedthe probability that  the risks  of  recession have  eased.  A  significantpart  of  this  is  unquestionably the  fact  that we  are not  seeing aweakening  in  final  demand despite  all  the  evidence  that  clearly pointsto  a far more rapid pace of  inventory  adjustment than  we hadcontemplated at  the  last meeting.  The lead  times  are  continuing  tofall  and the  inventory  adjustment process  is  still  going  on.  It  maybe  a bit premature  to  presume that  the adjustment  is  complete at  thisstage  or  approaching completion.  There  is  no  question  that we  arebeginning  to  see  order patterns  that  are  stabilizing, but  theadjustment has been  too  quick and  the timeframe  too  short  for us  tobelieve  that  we are  through  it  as  yet.  I would  not be  surprised tosee  industrial  production  sagging  for a number of  weeks  or a month  orso  before we  work our way through  this.  Nonetheless,  I think  theevidence  clearly  is  emerging that  the  underlying  structural  weaknessthat  concerned us  is  dissipating.  The evidence  of much strongergrowth  in output  is  lacking but,  as  I think Dave  Stockton said,  theprobabilities  of  that  occurring have gone up.  Indeed, while  theanecdotal  evidence around this  room has pointed with surprisingunanimity to  a pause,  the Districts  are doing better now  as  we  go  fromone  to  another  than  they were  three  months  ago.  I think  that probablyreflects  the  fact  that  the economy  is  coming back and growing at  afaster  pace, but real  pressure  on the up side  seems  a good distanceaway, judging  from all  of  the numbers  we have  at  this particularstage.  When we  look at  the  individual  company data and the  anecdotaldata on  orders,  it  is  clear  that  conditions are  improving overall, butit  is  a mixed bag.  It  is  not  the  straightforward universal  strengththat  the  economy  exhibited in  the  latter part  of  1994.8/22/95-36-Whatever  forecast  we  are  looking  at,  I think a  smooth patternis not  going  to  be  the actual  outcome.  Our  forecasts  are going to betested by the  fiscal  crunch we  are  all  talking about.  It  is  not  self-evident  to  me  that  the  crunch will  involve  a major contraction  infederal  spending.  I  think there  are  two  sides to  this  issue.  Firstof  all,  it  is  pretty obvious  that  if  the debt  limit  blocks  spending--and indeed, as  Larry Lindsey said,  the  chance  of  getting  a debt  limitextension  through  the House without a balanced budget  in place  is  verysmall--we will  have  a dramatic  shutting down  of  the government.  I aminclined to  the view that,  when push comes  to  shove, we  are going  toget  consecutive  one-week extensions of  the  debt  limit  rather  thanallowing it  to  push  the economy  down.  And the  ambiguity with respectto  the  question of  how appropriated but unspent  funds  are  employed invarious  authorization  bills, when  there  is  indeed no  authorization  forthe period after  September 30,  leads  me  to  conclude  that  the  rate  ofreduction in  discretionary  spending will be  modest  in  the  short  term.We will  get very  significant  cutbacks in  certain budgets,  but  overall,if  entitlement  spending  continues  as  indeed  it  does  in this  particularcontext,  the contraction  in  spending will  be modest  in  the  earlystages.  It  would be severe  if  a debt  limit  is  allowed to  go  intoeffect.If  in  this  process we  end up with a very sharp  reduction  infederal  spending,  the  fiscal  drag  issue will  arise, especially  if  itis  presumed  that  the  decline  in expenditures  will be  temporary.  Underthose conditions we will  not get  offsetting pressure from  fallinglong-term yields,  but  we will  get  a contractionary effect  from areduction in  incomes.  That will  require  very difficult policyjudgments  on our part  because  I don't  recall  any historical precedenttelling us  how all  this  works.  It  may well be  that  everyone will  seethe  decline  in  income  as  temporary and hence  the  saving rate  willcollapse but  expenditures  will not.  Nominal  GDP will  stand up  exceptfor  the  effects  of  liquidity constraints, of which there have  to besome.  But  there  is  no doubt  that until  we get  a sense  of  that,  wewill  not be  quite  sure  where  it will  come out.There  is  also  the distinct possibility--although hopefully  atthis  stage  it  is  a very small  probability--that we will  run  into  asituation in  which  the outlook  is  for materially  less budget  deficitreduction.  If  the outlook  for  substantial  deficit  reduction does  notlook as  likely as  it  does now, markets  are  going  to  react veryadversely.  We will  get  a significant rise  in  long-term rates  becausevery clearly  there  is  sizable deficit  reduction  embodied  in the  long-term rate  structure.  If  that  were to  happen, the  stock market  wouldcome  down very dramatically.  Therefore,  it  is  possible  that  thisfiscal  outlook  can create negative  real  effects  on  the economy  if  thebudget  deficit  reduction is  too much  or  if  it  is  too little.  It  isvery difficult  to  know what  the probability distribution  looks  like.The  one  thing  that  is  clear  is  that  the budget process  is  nowmoving  forward  to  some  form  of  crunch.  It  just  is  not  conceivable  atthis  stage,  at  least  as  I see  it,  that  there can be  a resolutionbefore October  1st.  I find  it  highly unlikely  that  continuingresolutions will  simply be  adopted as  they have  in  the past.  Somevariations  of  continuing resolutions  and debt  limit  extensions mayoccur, but  they are  surely not going to  apply universally.  That meansthat  there will  be some  impact  of  an  order of  magnitude  and a naturethat  I don't  think we  can get  a  sense of  at  this  particular stage.  We8/22/95can judge  that  better  after Labor  Day as we  begin  to  see whether  infact  there  are  going to  be  filibusters  on  the appropriations  bills  inthe  Senate.  If  we  don't  get  appropriations  bills, we  can be  certainthat  we will  not  get majority votes  for continuing  resolutions.Therefore,  there will  be  no budget  and no  legal  authority  to  spend.In  the  Budget Act  that was  passed around five  years ago,  Congressnarrowed very significantly the  ability of  the  President  to  definethreats  to  life and property  as  reasons  to  invoke  expenditures  toprotect  them.So,  we  have  emerging  an extraordinary  set  of  events  thatbelies  the  tranquility of  the Greenbook  forecast.  It  is  not  terriblyclear precisely how the  fourth quarter  is  going  to  come out.  The onething I am  absolutely certain of  is  that  it  is  not  going to  look  likethe Greenbook  forecast.  However,  I would not  know which numbers  havea higher probability  of  being realized because  I think  that  theGreenbook  forecast may be  the maximum likelihood estimate.  But  thenwho knows  what  the distribution  looks  like on  each  side  of  thatforecast?I conclude  from all  of  this  that we  don't know how  the budgetdebate will be  resolved.  We will have  another  shot  at  it  at  our  nextFOMC meeting, which  fortuitously occurs  just before  October  1st.  Ithink we  will  know a good deal  more  about how things  are  evolving atthat  stage.  As  a consequence  and in  the  context  of  our discussion instarting point  to  get  a sense  of  where we  are.  Other things  equal,that  rate  is  probably somewhat higher  than  we  are  likely  to want  it  tobe  somewhere  down the  track or  over  the  longer  run, with  "down thetrack" being  on  the  other side  of  the  fiscal  train wreck, to  keep  thisanalogy going.  In  the  immediate period ahead, it  strikes  me  that  thegeneral  outlook  is  extraordinarily benevolent and one  that  I view atthe moment  as  pointing to  no  change  in policy.  That  is,  "B" andsymmetrical  seems  to me  the most  sensible  approach until  the nextmeeting.  By  the next meeting,  I suspect  that we  are going  to  have  tomake  a number of  contingent decisions.  I will  be  very surprised  if wedo not  have  several  telephone  conference calls  in the month  of  Octoberas  this  budget  situation evolves  because  there will  have  to  becoordination between  the  Treasury and ourselves  to  ascertain what  isgoing  on and to  take  measures  that,  to  whatever extent possible, willmitigate  the  secondary consequences  of  this  fiscal process  that  willloom ever  larger  as  we move  into  the  fourth quarter.
