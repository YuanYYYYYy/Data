CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody like  to move approval  ofthe  minutes?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  The Committee hasreceived a memorandum on  the delegation  of  responsibility  for appealsof  staff  decisions  to deny access  to  Committee  records  under  theFreedom of  Information Act.  The need for this  delegation  stems  fromthe vacancy that was  created when David Mullins  resigned from theFOMC.  The  recommendation is  to  follow past practice  and elect  theindividuals  who are  involved in  the  similar  function with respect  tothe  Board of  Governors--Governor Phillips  as  the principal andGovernor Yellen as  the  alternate--to  serve  in that  function for  theFOMC.  Does  anybody have  any questions  with respect  to  thatmemorandum?  If  not, would somebody like  to  move  it?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  So  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  I turn to  the  ViceChairman for  a nomination  to  elect  a Deputy General  Counsel  from theFederal  Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  ErniePatrikis,  who has  been serving  in  that position, has  been elected withthe  approval  of  the  Board of  Governors  to  the position of First  VicePresident  of  the  Federal Reserve Bank  of New York, effective June  1.His  successor  as  the General  Counsel  of  the  New York Bank and  theperson we  recommend as  Deputy General  Counsel  of  the FOMC  is  ThomasBaxter.  Mr. Baxter  is  40  years old, even younger than most  of  us,  anda graduate of Georgetown University.  His  specialty has beenlitigation.  We  consider him an outstanding attorney and a very  fineperson, and we are proud to  recommend him to you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Moved and  seconded and approved withoutobjection.  The next  agenda  item  is  a review of  the  Committee'sProgram  for Security of  FOMC  Information.  There are  a number  of  itemsin  the  memorandum you received.  I don't want  to  go  over  themnecessarily.  Does  anybody have  any questions with respect  to  them?  Ithought  they were pretty pro  forma myself.  There  is  the  issue ofincreasing  from 4 to  7 the  number of  persons with access  to Class  IFOMC materials within each Reserve  Bank;  that  increase would squarethe  number with  that  for  those  who have access  to  Class  II  materials.I gather  that  a number of  the  members have  raised this  issue.  Thereare a couple of  other items  of  a similar nature.  Does  anybody haveany questions with respect  to  this  matter?

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, since  it  is  proposed  to  increasethe  access  to Class  I from  4 to  7, that  means  the  same  number ofpeople  can have  access to  Class  I and to  Class  II  as you noted.  Itmight be of  some  value, at  least  to  us,  if  we  could also move up by 3the  access  to Class  II.  I don't know if  there would be  any problemwith that;  at  least  I want  to raise  it  as  a possibility.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  reason for  the proposal  to  increasestaff access  to  Class  I is  basically  that Jerry Jordan and  I thinksome others  among you have raised questions  about  the  current  limitand have suggested moving it  up  from 4.  The  Secretariat,  I assume  inits  exuberance,  said  "Well, 4 is  an  exotic number so why not try  7?"I wonder whether  7 may be too  high and whether we ought  to back offthat  to  keep  a gap between Class  I and Class II.  Suppose we  did raiseClass  I to  5.  Is  that  a problem?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  No.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  President Jordan's,suggestion was  to  go  from 4to  at  least  6.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  How much higher  do you want to  go?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I am not  sure why it  is  helpful  to  have accessto  Class  I and Class  II  differ.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The basic presumption  is  that  there  arefewer people  designated  "top secret"  than  "secret."  Now, whether  thatis  a valid  judgment--[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I think  it  would be  desirable  to  allow a fewmore  people  to have  access  to  less  important  information  for  theexperience  of  reading  it  and understanding  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think the  issue  here  is  basically notthe  Class  II;  it's  the  Class  I.  Since  the proposal  is  to  give  allthose who now have access  to  Class  II  access  to Class  I as well,  isthere any  status  to having  Class  I clearance?  I don't  know.  Mr.Secretary, do  you have any suggestions  on this?  I got  away a verylong punt!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I'm  sorry  I made my suggestion!

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  When it  comes  to  returning punts,  I am no BrianMitchell,  I can  tell you that!  I would suggest  that you  let me poll3/28/95-3-the rest  of  the  Committee  to  see whether people  really want  to  movefrom 7 to  10  on  access  to  the  Greenbook.  This  is  a pretty sensitivedocument;  that is  what  we are  talking  about.  I don't  know  if  Mike hasany views  on  this.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  are  talking about  Part  I.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes,  Part  I of  the Greenbook.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Part  I is  classified as  Class  II.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right.  The number  having access is  now 7 andPresident Hoenig's  suggestion is  to  raise  that  to  10.  I guess  I'dlike  to  think about  it  and see whether  there is  a ground  swell  fromthe  rest  of  the  Committee.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't we bring  this back  then at  thenext meeting?  There  is  no  urgency about  it.  Does  anyone else  haveany views  that would be helpful?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I just  pulled out a confidential  Class  II-FOMCdocument here.  It  reports  on  exchange  rates.  I read the  documentvery carefully and I don't  see  why it  is  confidential.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  reason, Governor Lindsey,  is  that we  oftendo  report intervention numbers  in  that  document.  We can't  say it'sClass  II when it  has  intervention numbers,  and it's not  classifiedwhen it  doesn't  have  intervention numbers  because then we  would berevealing  something.  That  is  the point.  That's why it's  always ClassII  regardless  of whether  or  not  it  has  intervention numbers  in it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The presumption is  that  since  it  reportsthe  intervention numbers  when  intervention occurs,  the  absence  of  sucha report means  intervention was  zero,  which also  is  classifiedinformation.  That  is  sort  of  putting  it  backwards!Does  anyone else want  to  raise  any issues with  respect  tothis before we  reconsider it  at  the next  meeting?  If  not,  the nextitem on  the  agenda  is  a review of  the  Authorization for  Domestic Openquestions?  Incidentally,  all  of  these items  would ordinarily be onthe  February meeting agenda  and were moved forward  for obvious  reasonsrelating to  the  crowded agenda  for  the  February meeting.  Are  thereany questions  with respect  to  that memo?  If not,  would somebody  liketo move  it?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So move.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  The next  issue,which also  was moved  from the  February meeting, is  the  review  of(a) the  Foreign Currency Authorization,  (b) the  Foreign CurrencyDirective, and  (c) the  Procedural  Instructions with Respect  to  ForeignCurrency Operations  including a review of  the  "warehousing" authorityincorporated in  (a) and  (b).  These items were,  of  course,  discussedat  great  length at  recent meetings and telephone  conferences,  and I am3/28/95-4-just  curious  as  to  whether anyone has  anything  to  add to  the ratherexhaustive discussions  that we have  had.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, is  this  the  time  to  saysomething about warehousing  if we  have views  on  that?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I have  just  a few  comments  if  I could makethem briefly.  Ted Truman  sent  out a lot  of background materialsregarding warehousing and  I reread most  of  it  and reread  thememorandum  that Virgil  and his  colleagues  did earlier.  I think  thememo makes  it  clear that  from a legal  standpoint  the  Fed definitelyhas  the  authority--or certainly that  we can  make a strong  case  thatthe  Fed has  the  authority--to warehouse  foreign exchange for  theTreasury, and I understand that.  But  however  defensible theseoperations may be  from a legal  perspective,  I just  don't think  thecase  is  very compelling when I look  at  the  issue  in a somewhat broadercontext  that  takes  account  of  the  Fed's  role  in  the  governmentgenerally and  the  independence we  are  supposed to  have.  As  I see  it,warehousing  is  essentially a fiscal  policy action  or  at  least  is  fullyequivalent  in  its  effect  to  a fiscal policy action.  By that  I meanthat  in  the  end the  warehousing operation has  exactly the  same  finaleffect  as  if  Congress authorized  the  Treasury or  the  ESF  to  purchasethe  foreign  exchange and fund  the purchase by issuing  additional debtin the  market.  The  only difference when the  transaction  is  done viawarehousing is  that  the  usual Congressional  appropriations  process  iscircumvented, and  the purchase  does  not  show up  in  the  budget.  Ireally worry about  the  risk  that  we  are  taking over  the  longer  termwith  this practice.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do you mean market  risk?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  No,  I mean  the risk  to  the  institutionalposition of  the  Federal  Reserve.  That  is  really the  issue  I am tryingto  focus  on, Mr. Chairman.  I think we  can  get  some  sense  of  that  inthe public's reaction  to  the Mexican  support package.  I don't want  togo  into  that  in any  detail.  I just  think it's  an example  that  is  veryrelevant here.  As  we all  know, the use  of public  funds  to  assistforeign  governments,  however  sensible that may be  in particularinstances,  is  a highly charged political  issue, especially when  somepeople  see good  alternative uses  for the  funds  at home.  TheCongressional  leadership apparently  supported the package  in  thisinstance, but  I don't  believe  Congress would have voted to  authorizethe  funds.  I think a broad segment  of  the  general  public,  rightly orwrongly, opposes  assisting Mexico  so  generously.  The  point here  andthe  risk as  I see  it  is  that  if  things  go  badly in Mexico goingforward, this  could become  an  issue  in the  election next  year.  Inthat  event,  our  role would become more  widely understood, and it  isquite possible  that people  could begin  to raise questions  about  ourindependence.  It  could come  under much more  careful  scrutiny.I would sum up  the  issue briefly this way:  Congress placedthe  Fed outside  the  regular appropriations process  to protect  ourindependence.  If  we are perceived as  abusing  this  sort  of  off-budgetstatus, we run some  serious  risks  over  the  longer run.  Now, Irecognize  the practical  difficulty of  trying  to pull back  immediatelyfrom these operations.  But  I would hope  that  you, Mr.  Chairman, and3/28/95this  Committee would at  least consider conveying  our  concernsforcefully to  the  Treasury and then work with them hopefully to  reachan  accord whereby we could withdraw from  these  operations  over aperiod of  time, maybe by  some  defined target date.  Again,  I recognizethat  there  is  a clear  legal  basis  for  doing these operations,  but  Ithink the broader argument  against doing them is  really quitepersuasive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  One  of  the  reasons  why I was verycareful  to  indicate  to  the Congress  that we  indeed had thiswarehousing facility with respect  to  the  Mexican deal  was precisely toput  it  up  front.  Now, some members  of  Congress may not haveunderstood it,  but  I must tell  you that  I got no negative responses,and the  types  of questions  they were asking suggested  to me  that  atleast  those  who were asking  questions  had some  idea  of  the  nature  ofthis  whole  operation.  On the  issue of how we deal  with the Treasuryin  this  government,  as  fiscal  agent we  involve  ourselves  in varioustypes  of  support  for  the  Treasury and that  does  in  one sense  impingeon  the  independence  of  this  institution.  The  trouble,  unfortunately,is  that  we can not be  fully independent  because  there  is  only  onegovernment and there  is  an  element  here of  trying  to draw the  line.  Ithink we  are  all  somewhat  uncomfortable about  the  warehousingfacility.  I think we  are all  uncomfortable to a greater or  lesserextent  about  our own swap  line  facility,  and in discussions with theTreasury regarding all  of  these  issues we basically have been  to alesser  or greater  extent  somewhat  in opposition to  the  initiatives  ofthe  Treasury.  But we  also  recognize, as  I think I indicated here  anumber  of  months  ago,  that  the  central bank has very broadresponsibilities  to  ensure  the  safety and soundness  of  the  financialsystem.  We  could move  ourselves  back into  a very narrow central bankmode,  and I would agree with you  that  in  that respect  there would beless  risk  for us.  But  I am not  sure whether we would be  giving  thecountry something  of value.  I think we have  to  take  some  risks,  butcertainly the  issues  that you raise  are valid ones.  I don't  thinkthere  is  great disagreement about  the  need to be very careful  on  theseissues.  I think we  have been careful  and I hope we will  continue  tobe.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I appreciate that  and I am sorry to  keepraising these  issues.  I do think  that  this  is  not  a short-term risk;it's  not  the  sort  of  thing  that  is  likely to  hit us  in  the  faceimmediately.  But  I worry that  over  time  those who  really would liketo  compromise the position of  this  institution in  the  government,  ifthey are  looking  for  an  argument,  this  is  I think the  strongestargument  they would find.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  strongest  argument  they have  ismonetary policy.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Mr. Chairman, just  to make a technical  point onthe  warehousing issue:  I don't want  to  comment  on the  politicalaspects  of  it;  that is  not  my role.  But as  a technical matter  theTreasury could conduct  its  warehousing transactions  with the  market  orwith  another  financial  institution.  So  the  notion that warehousing asa technical  matter  is  an  evasion  of  the  fiscal  authority of  Congress  Ithink  is  not  correct.  I am not  talking  about perceptions.  We have3/28/95worked hard and have  changed  the warehousing arrangement  so  that  it  isnow very clearly an  arms-length, market-related transaction.  We do  iton exactly the  same  terms  that  the Treasury could if  it  divided  it  allup and did it  with 150  institutions  in  the  market.  All we  are doingis  to  accommodate  the  Treasury as  a convenience to  them.  This doesraise  questions about  our  role and our  role  in assisting Mexico inthese  kinds of  things, which  I perfectly well  acknowledge.  But  as  atechnical  matter, the  transaction  could be  done with the market.Therefore, I don't  think  it's  fair  to  say that  this  is  an evasion ofthe  fiscal  authority of  Congress.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  When it's  done with us,  though,  basically itdoes not  show up  in the budget,  is  that  right?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It  wouldn't  show up  in  the  budget  either way.What  the  Treasury does  is  to  swap  their DM or  their yen with us.  Theysell  it  to us  spot  and buy  it  back forward.  They  can do  that  onexactly the same  terms with Citibank or  Chase or  Deutsche Bank or theBank of  Tokyo, whatever  institution  it  might be.  That would haveexactly the  same  impact  on  them fiscally.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  fiscal  effect occurs when the  ESFfunds  are created.  At  the moment  the  ESF has  a big set  of  assets  anda big set  of  liabilities.  Nobody is  talking  about  expanding  the sizeof  the  ESF or  increasing its  capital  through appropriations.  What weare  talking  about  is  refinancing  its  assets  on  a different basis  andthat  has no  fiscal  effects.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  My  feeling is  that  if  it  can be  done withprivate  institutions and the  market, we  ought  to  see  what we  can do  topush the Treasury to  do  that.  Whatever convenience  the  Treasury isgaining from doing  it with  us  is,  from our  standpoint  at  least,  offsetby the  longer-term risk of  our  continuing with  these operations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  a legitimate  question.  In myview the  issue  essentially  is  that  if  the Treasury requests us  to  doit,  we have  to  give  their request very serious  consideration.  Theirview may be  that while  the  transaction  is  technically  feasible  in theprivate market,  the  inconvenience  involved in  arranging relativelylarge  sums  there  raises questions  as  to  the  efficiency of  theoperation.  That  is  a reasonable consideration  that we  have toconfront.  We have  to  be careful  as  to precisely how we  get ourselvesintertwined with  the Treasury;  that  is  a very crucial  issue.  Inrecent years  I think we have widened the  gap  or  increased the wedgebetween us  and the  Treasury,  as Ted was mentioning.  In  other words,we have gone  to  a market  relationship  and basically to  an  arms-lengthapproach where  feasible  in an  effort  to make  certain that  we don'tinadvertently get  caught up  in some  of  the  Treasury initiatives  thatthey want us  to  get involved in.  Most  of  the  time we  say  "no."

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I understand those points.  I just  hope  thatwe can  continue that process  and widen  that  gap a little  further.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I personally am not  uncomfortable withwhat we  are doing.  I am uncomfortable with  the  thought  that  we mighthave to pick up  the  entire  $20  billion warehousing, but  that  obviouslyis  a very remote  contingency.  President Jordan.3/28/95

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  All  the  things  that  Ted sent  out  ruined myweekend as  well!  I read all  this material before,  one  time  oranother, but  I always  have  to  reread it  because  there  is  so much thatI can't remember all  of  it.  I am  satisfied that  from a technicalstandpoint and a legal  standpoint  there  is  not  really an  issue  to bediscussed because  the  lawyers can always  figure out  a way to  dowhatever it  is  we  think  is  good public policy to  do.  So,  the questioncomes  down  to whether  or  not  it  is  good public  policy.The  current  set  of  institutional  arrangements was  designed ina totally different  era  for  a different purpose.  The ESF,  swaps,warehousing--all of  that--were  intended to give us  access  toliquidity.  The  ESF was  designed when the dollar was  not  even thedominant  reserve currency.  The other arrangements came  into beingwhen we  had the Bretton Woods  system.  If  we did not now have  the  ESFand the capability of warehousing or  have  something  like  swap  linesand we were dealing with a situation such as  the  one  that  surfaced inwould have  designed to address  those  issues.  In today's world, giventhe  role  of  the dollar  and our arrangements with other central  banks,we would  establish  a set  of  institutional  arrangements  to  provideliquidity  to  other  countries  such  as Mexico  or,  in the  future, Chile,Costa Rica,  whomever.  We would not  set  up something resembling whatwe  have today.What  I would like  to  see happen  is  for  Peter  Fisher to  workwith  Board staff to  think  through what  kind of  institutionalarrangements we would like  to have  for  the  21st  century  and producesome  kind of  report by  the  time  this  issue  comes up  again  nextbetween now and February.  In  the private  sector  if  they had such aproblem  they would give  staff a mandate  and get  it  done by threemonths  from now.  But  at  Fed speed, we  could ask that the  staff  comeback with a set  of proposals by next February as  to  the  kind ofarrangements  that would provide  international  liquidity  to  thesecountries, especially  those that  are  less  developed and  thatoccasionally get themselves  in  a mess.  The  objective  is  for us  tocarry out  our central  bank role without  getting into  this  possibilityof  people  saying we  are doing  something that  is  not  consistent withforeign policy objectives  or doing something  that  is  subverting a debtlimit  issue  that may come up between  the  executive  and legislativebranches  of  government.  As  in  1979  and 1980,  we definitely don't wantto get  ourselves, as  a central bank,  in between  the  executive  andlegislative branches  if  they are playing  a political game  oversomething  like  the  debt  ceiling.  We want  to  be  nowhere  in sight  ifsomething  like  that happens  again.  Warehousing leaves us  open to bein  a position of  getting  caught up in  something  that we don't  intendto do.  So,  I would just  like  to  see  this whole  issue  rethought.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The question really is  whether  or notour  role  or  central  function is  to provide  dollar  liquidity  to  othernations  on  an ongoing basis  or  on an ad hoc  basis.  If  you are  goingto  raise  the  argument  that  the  international  financial markets havechanged  from where they were under the  Bretton Woods  structure,  theemergence  of  private global  finance has  to  a very substantial  extentmade much of  the purposes of  the  Bretton Woods  structure  of  dubiousmerit in  the  current environment.  The  reason  I raised questionsearlier  about  the  use  of  swaps  is  that  their role  in  the modern world3/28/95--especially the  order of magnitude  of  the  swaps  if  we  look at  them  inthe context  of  the  size  and types  of problems  that  seem to  haveemerged in  the  EMS,  Mexico  and the like--seems  to be  an  anachronism.I am a little concerned, however, about  setting up  a study  in  the  formin which you  suggested.  That  is  an  expensive undertaking.  I do  thinkit might not  be  a bad  idea,  however,  to  have a couple  of memorandathat discuss  the broader  questions without  getting  into  theinitiatives  that you are  suggesting.  Your proposal  strikes  me as  amuch  larger project  and use  of  resources  than  I think we are preparedto  get  involved in  until we  get a clearer  focus  on how we view thisissue.  The  important  question that  I think you are  raising, Jerry, ishow much  of our post  Bretton Woods  structure  at  the  Federal Reserve  isan anachronism and what  our  role  is  in  today's  environment.  I wouldmuch prefer  to  have a few  short memoranda on  that  than  spend a lot  oftime  trying  to  think  of what  type of  structure we  should  go  to  fromhere.  So,  unless  someone  has  an objection to  that,  I will  request Tedto  see  whether or not  we could have  some  short  review of  the historyof  this  issue.  It  would involve  revisiting a lot  of  the material  thathas  been put  together, but  I think the  central  focus  should be  on thequestion of  what  difference  the  emergence of  private  global  financemakes relative  to  the  structure  that we  have had since  it  evolved inthe  1960s.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I don't  have any objection, but  this  is  anissue  that has  to  have been discussed at  tables  like  this  around  theworld, given what  has happened in Mexico, Argentina,  and othercountries.  I am wondering what  rethinking  is  going on  internationallywith regard to  how these  sorts  of  things play out and what can  bedone.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On the  basis of  the meetings  that  I atleast have been  involved in--and some  of  our  colleagues have been  insimilar  meetings--I  think there is  a general  recognition that  the  sizeof  the problem  that  emerged in Mexico  and  the  size of  theinternational  facility that was perceived to  be  necessary to  addressit clearly rule  out  a generic facility.  There  is  not enough  cash  inthe world to  handle  the  problems without  producing potentially  largeinflationary pressures  through use  of  SDRs,  IMF quota expansions,  andall  of  that.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  The  moral  hazard is  extraordinary.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  including what  I am  sure  the  IMFwould like,  which  is  for  the  IMF  to become a world bank lender  of  lastresort.  That  is  about  the  last  resort  I should  think for  anything.This  has  led us  to  the  question of whether  it  is possible  to havebankruptcy statutes  for  sovereign nations.  As you know, at  the  momentthat  does  not exist  and the question  is  whether there  is  a mechanismthat would make  it  possible  to  address  the  types  of  problemsconfronting Mexico in  a restructuring mode  that  is  the  equivalent of  abankruptcy facility rather  than by providing  liquidity, which isimplicit  in our  swap  and other  relationships.  That discussion  isgoing forward  at  the  BIS.  Ted,  I assume  there  is  some  talk at  theHalifax Summit on  this?3/28/95-9-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The Mexico  situation, for better or  for  worse,has  clearly given the  Halifax  Summit something  to  focus  on--somethingmore than just  chit-chat  about  stable  exchange rates,  if  I may put  itthat way.  Doing something  in  the bankruptcy or  orderly workout  areais  one  of  the  ideas  that  is  under some  discussion.  It's  also  fair  tosay that  other ideas  under discussion  include  some that  the Chairmanhas  tried to  pour  cold water  on--that of  vastly  increasing the  size  ofthe IMF  and its  capacity to deal  with these kinds  of  situations.  Idon't  think there  is  a consensus  among the various nations  involved inthe G-7  on what  to do  at  the  moment.  It  appears  that most  options  arestill  on  the  table,  though  some people think that  a few options havebeen taken off.

MS. MINEHAN.  I would  think  that whatever rethinking we doabout what  the Federal  Reserve's  response should be  and how we viewthese  things  has  to  take place  in  the  context of  how the  rest  of  theworld  is  thinking about  these  issues.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes,  certainly there  are big and small  issuesinvolved and both  types  have been raised here  in  this  discussion.That's partly because  we  started with Mexico, which on  the  one hand  isa country-specific  type  of problem.  On the  other hand, Mexico  isregarded as  symptomatic,  as  the  Chairman has  said,  of  the  nature  ofthe  international  financial  system and its  functioning  and thepotential problems  and challenges  as  we move  into  the  21st  century.It's  difficult  to  sort  those  things  out.  As  far  as  country-specificproblems are  concerned,  it  is  fair  to  say that many other  centralbanks  of  the major industrial  countries  are  in  fact more  involved inthis process  than we  are.  The  nature of  their  involvement  isdifferent  from ours.  It might  be useful  to the  Committee,  as  one ofthe  little  studies  that  the  Chairman requested,  for  us  to  describewhat  other G-10  central banks do  with regard to  dealing with thesesmaller--if  I may put  it  that  way--problems.  Indeed, in most  of  thecases  where efforts have been made to  help other  countries we have  notbeen involved in terms  of  our own money, though  the  U. S. Treasury isoften  involved whereas  other central banks have been involved.  Anexample  is  the  current  effort  to put  together a bridge  loan  forArgentina.  You will  find the  other G-10  central  banks  backing the  BISin  that  loan.  In  the  case  of  United States participation, if  thatgoes  forward,  it will  be  done exclusively by  the Treasury.  Most ofthose central  banks  in  turn are  supported by  their  treasuries  in  oneway or  another, sometimes  formally but not  always  formally.  In  somecases  there are central  banks that  take  a degree  of  risk  in a loan  toanother  country  in a far  corner of  the world;  an  example  is  Swedenrelative to Argentina.  The  Federal Reserve  has  chosen not  to  do  that.So  maybe it  would be useful,  at  least  as  a background note,  to  try  toput  together  a study to  describe what  other countries  do.  Thatdoesn't  touch the  big issues  but  it  might help  deal  with the  littleones.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  It's probably not  right  to  think that we candot  every  "i" and cross  every  "t" and have a set  process  that wefollow  in  all circumstances.  But what you're  suggesting would behelpful,  I think,  in  terms  of  our understanding this better.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman, you have been  as  muchinvolved with this  as  anybody.3/28/95-10-

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Yes, Mr.  Chairman.  I think that  avery basic  issue  that  exists  even in  light of  the very changedinternational  financial markets  is  whether an individual  country isresponsible  for its  own  conduct,  including paying  the price  for  itsown mistakes.  The  debates  that were very difficult  on occasion  in  theMexican situation were  those where  some  of  our normal  alliesquestioned whether we were  forgiving Mexico excessively for policyerrors.  We took  the view, as you know,  that Mexico  was unique,  notjust unusual, and that  there was very  serious  systemic risk involved.That  was not  the  easiest  case  to make  as Alan Blinder and  I discoveredat  the  January and February BIS  Sunday night dinners  and Mike Kelleyat  the March dinner.  Having been the permanent  feature  from theFederal  Reserve  at  all  three meetings,  I got  to  get my head bloodiedat  all  three!I think one of  the  difficult questions  in moving towardelaborate discussions  of  the  IMF becoming the  lender of  last  resort,which  I think is  a terrible  idea  as you  do, and even whether we  shouldmodify  significantly the  swap  lines  and the  other  central  bankrelationships  that  exist  from  the  Bretton Woods  era  is  just  that basicquestion:  Is  it  the  responsibility of  each country, including ourown,  to manage  its  affairs  in  such a way that  the market  does not  turnand punish it  severely?  The main  thing that  the  speed and size  ofcapital  flows  have  changed is  that  the punishment  is  very quick andvery severe.  It's  not all  that  different;  it's  just  faster  anddeeper.  There  is  great  reluctance on  the part  of  leading  centralbanks  in  Europe and Japan,  and I think by and large  those  of us  aroundthe  table here,  to  think  that we  should  shift  to  a world in whicheverybody can misbehave  and  the world will  take  care  of  them.  Theworld  doesn't have  the  riches  or  the  resources  to  make  that possible.I think we  have to  be  careful,  including  in meetings  like  the HalifaxSummit,  not  to be moving in  this  excessively and unrealisticallypermissive direction.The  Federal  Reserve,  it  seems  to me,  has been handlingbrilliantly the  very difficult  balancing act  involved in  beingsupportive  of U.S. policy on Mexico, which we  thought was basically agood  idea at  least  in substance--I  say that  as  a compliment  to you,Mr. Chairman, because  you had to  do most  of  it--without  gettingconfused that  it  should be  translated  into  something that  is  much morebroadly  applicable.  That policy was  to  consider the Mexican caseunique, which was  very difficult  for  us  to do  because  the  nextdeserving case  in  the  view of many people was  Argentina.  One  couldargue  that  the Argentines  have had better policy  and  that  they  aretaking much more aggressive  actions  to  fix themselves.  And thereforeit was  tough  for  us  to  say that  we  thought Mexico  needed support,including  support  from  the  Federal  Reserve, but  that  we did not  thinkArgentina needed our  support.  I think  the single best  argument  thatwe had is  that Mexico  is unique.  If  it  isn't,  if  it's  only unusual,God knows where you decide  the  line  gets  established.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  there  is  no  further  discussion, Iwould like  to combine  the  three  foreign  policy instruments  and movethem simultaneously.  Would  somebody like  to  make  a motion?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?3/28/95-11-

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Let's move  onfinally to  our regular  agenda and I call  on Peter Fisher.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter on  either  thedomestic or  the  foreign side?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Peter,  there's been some press commentary  to  theeffect that  the dollar's role  as  the  dominant international  reservecurrency is  on the wane,  that we  are  following  the pound sterling'searlier  slide.  Yet  the facts  are, as  you have reported, that  centralbanks  around  the  world have  substantially increased their holdings  ofdollars  and reduced their  holdings of  deutschemarks  and othercurrencies.  These  outside commentaries would  suggest that  centralbanks around  the  world are now holding a lot more  dollar reserves  thanthey really want.  Is  that your perception?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think a number  of  central  banks are  holdingmore  dollar reserves than  some people  within those  central banks  thinkthey ought  to be holding.  I wouldn't pretend to  say that  is  theofficial posture  of  all  the  central banks,  but  I think  the  leakageinto  the markets  occurs  as a result of  that.  There  are a number  ofcentral  banks  in Asia  that both have accumulated  large dollar  reservesand  have  a rather  active approach to  foreign  exchange trading as  apotential  source of  central bank profit.  In  those central  banks,  somepeople may have a view that  they would rather hold  fewer  dollars, andsince the  banks'  foreign  exchange desks  tend to be  somewhat active,the market  then  is  free  to  interpret  that when they move  one way thatmust be a secular  trend.  It  is  more  frequently just  trading back andforth, but that  sort  of activity certainly has provided some  credenceto  that general  story.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  One  final  question:  In particular, do you knowhow the  Bundesbank and the  Bank of  Japan  feel  about  the  exchangetranslation  that has  been eroding  their dollar  assets?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I talk to  them  from time  to  time  about  that.They  are not  happy about  it,  but  the Bundesbank is  fully committed toa single  reserve currency--the  dollar.  They have no  appetite fordiversifying  their portfolio.  I think the Bank  of Japan at  a policylevel  is  still more  or  less committed to  a dollar  reserve policy.They have  diversified somewhat  and are  holding a few more marks.  It'sstill a tiny,  tiny fraction of  their  total  reserves.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  This  is  a question for  either  Peter or  Ted.  Interms of  causes  of  the  weakness in  the  dollar, you referred to  thechange  in  expectations about  future U.S.  fiscal  deficits.  One way tolook at  the effect  of deficits  is  that  if monetary policy has  aninflation objective, the  impact  of greater  deficits  is  to  increase  thereal  rate of  interest.  Very often that would lead  to a higher valueof  the dollar.  In  fact,  there are many macro models  that have  thattype  of  linkage.  For you  to  get  a lower value of  the  dollar,  I think3/28/95-12-there  has  to  be  an assumption  that  the  debt  would be monetized.  Myquestion is,  of  these  two  types  of  influences  on  the  dollar, whatroles  do you think they play over  the  longer  term and what  role havethey played in  the most  recent period?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I'll  take  the  short  term and  leave Ted with thelong  term!  In  the  short  term,  I think the  fiscal  picture weighs  onthe  dollar as  I mentioned principally in  terms  of  the  competence  issueas  it  relates  to  U.S.  economic  management, not  in  the  sense  offorecasting  a macro  economic  effect.  Whether  analytically  correct  ornot, market participants  do  in  a sense add up  the two  deficits,  thecurrent  account  deficit and  the  fiscal  deficit, and say we  can'tmanage anything so  they can't  find any reason  to buy dollars  or holddollars.  In the  short  run, at  least  in  the  last  three  months,  I don'tthink the markets  have really  tried to  digest  the  implications,  as youhave,  on a much more sophisticated basis.  But  they are  negative inthe  short run.  Now, I'll  defer to  Ted on  the  tougher  question.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  on  the  tougher  question,  I think you areabsolutely right  about  the  result  that  the  standard macro models  willgive you:  A cut  in  the fiscal  deficit will produce  lower  interestrates  and that  in turn  will  translate  through  to  reducing  the  externaldeficit  through  lower  interest  rates  and a lower currency.  One way tosquare that with  the  notion  that  the  dollar  should  appreciate  if  thefiscal  deficit  is  cut,  is  to  distinguish between real  and nominal.  Tothe  extent  that  there  is  a fear  out  there  that  the central  bank willseek at  some point  to  monetize the  deficit or  float  it  away throughmore  inflation,  then a country could have  a stronger nominal  currencyat  the  same  time  that  it  had a weaker  real  currency.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I guess  the point  I want  to make  is  that  it  keysoff  what monetary policy--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  There  is  one  other argument  for which  there  issome  support  in the  literature.  It  is  a longer-term argument  thatwould run  from a lower deficit  to  more  investment,  a more  competitivecurrency, and therefore an  appreciation  of  the dollar.  That  is  a verylong-run  argument.  A slightly different argument has  a timingfeature:  If  the  fiscal deficit  is  cut,  that will  start  to bring downthe  current account  deficit  sooner than otherwise  and  less  of  adepreciation will  be needed  in  the  long  run than otherwise.  That  is  asort of  "compared with what"  argument.  In  terms of  the long  run, muchof  this  argument does  turn  on  the  factors  that  Peter was  talkingabout--the  notion that  the  fiscal  situation has played on  the dollarmore  in  terms  of whether we, the  United States,  can manage our  affairsappropriately.  That probably has  been exacerbated again in  thepsychological  realm by the Mexican situation.  Those  two situationshave played off  against  each  other more  than  any deep  reading of  themacroeconomics involved.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I want  to make  a comment  on  Bob Parry's  pointand then pose a question.  On Bob's point  and the  answers  to  it,  isn'tit  relevant  that  over the  last  three months,  six months,  nine months,twelve months--pick your  timeframe;  it  almost  doesn't matter--surveysof  inflationary expectations  in  the  United States have  shown nodeterioration and long bonds here  are  trading at  lower interest  rates,3/28/95-13-not  higher  interest  rates?  Those two  things would seem to me  largelypersuasive--although  none of  this  is  definitive with regard  to  thestate  of  long-term  inflationary expectations absent  an  index bond, forwhich all  of  us here  at  the  Federal  Reserve have  been rooting  for  along  time.  But  it  is  about  the  best  information  that we have, and itseems  to  me  that  it  speaks with one voice on  the extent  to which theguess  the  opposite of  "ahistorical"  is  "historical"--that is  also  anhistorical  observation because  the  Federal  Reserve has not  beenmonetizing deficits.  Whether  one has rational  or  adaptiveexpectations,  I think  it  is  sensible not  to presume that  the  FederalReserve  is  going to monetize deficits.  And I don't believe  theDo  either of you disagree with that,  Ted or  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  No.  I only wish I had thought  of  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Now the  question I was  going  to pose:  Peter,  Ithought you said--correct me  if  I just misheard what  you were  reading--that  the  short  end led interest  rates down  since  the  last FOMCmeeting.  Did you say  that?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  That  is  our  sense  that  the  short end--

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I am reading  the  Greenbook table--

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  Peter was  referring to  the  shorterintermediate  term,  the  1- to  3-year area.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I am very sorry if  that was not clear.  I wasreferring  to  the  2-year maturity of  the  coupon  curve.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Okay.  Fine.  I have  no  question in  that  case.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Peter,  you mentioned that  the dealers weresurprised by  the demand  for Treasuries  and that was  what made  thedifference  in  terms  of  the price  and yield moves  in  the TreasuryTreasury market.  Has  there been a big change  in  the  ownership  ofthese securities  foreign vis-a-vis  domestic?  Or  is  it  evenappropriate  to  ask  that?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No,  I don't  think  there has  been a big rush offoreign demand  for Treasuries.  The  sense  is  that  the  money has beencoming  out  of  the  investment  community,  the  mutual  funds,  and  the  realmoney crowd into  the  dealer  community.  The dealers have beensurprised by  that.  Their  tendency had been to  play  the market  fromthe  short  side during  this period.  It  gave the market a bit  of  achoppy feel  from  time  to  time,  and in  fact  contributed to  some of  therise  in prices.  There was  a phenomenon  of  the market  doing betterduring  the  afternoons,  which was sort  of  curious.  We  feel  that was  abit  the  result  of  the  dealers  just  catching up with  their  owncustomers.  But we  don't have  any sense of  foreign demand.  There isconstant  chatter  going on about  how the  capital  flight from  LatinAmerica  is  fueling the  bond market.  Capital  flight  from LatinAmerica, however defined,  is  not of  a sufficient  size  to  drive  the3/28/95-14-overall  dollar  exchange rate.  It  is  large  relative  to  the peso  andother Latin American currencies.  It's  hard to  see  if  it  is  not bigenough  to  affect  the  dollar  exchange rate overall  how it  is  really bigenough  to  drive  the  bond market, which  is  rather  large.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  It's  not big  enough  to affect  the  Treasury

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  So,  these  stories  are more  in  the  nature ofanecdotes  floating around than  anything we  have been able  to  pin down.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  There  is  one  explanation  that  I'm not sure isright, but it  helps  to answer  the question of why the dollar was weakrelative to many of  the European currencies over  this  period.  Onestory that  can be  told is  that  there has  been some  degree  of  flightfrom  emerging markets, or  shifts  in demand for  emerging marketinstruments.  And emerging market  instruments  are dollar-denominated.

[SECTION]

Ms.  MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The most  important  of  these are  the  Brady bonds.Those bonds have  taken  a tremendous  hit  over the  first  quarter  of  thisyear.  Although U.S.  investors hold some  of  the  Brady bonds,  they  alsoare held around the  world by  all  kinds  of  investment  funds.  It's notirrational  for  those  funds, many of  which are Japanese--after  allthere  is  a lot  of  savings  in  Japan--to  think that  as  investors  moveout  of  Brady bonds  that are  dollar  denominated instruments,  they willmove  into  instruments  denominated in  the  other  two or  three majorcurrencies,  including  the  Swiss  franc.  So  that  seems  to  me  to  be  theone element  one  can point  to  that would help explain  some  degree  ofrally in  terms  of  our own bond market  and some degree  of  weakness ofthe  dollar  vis-a-vis  the  yen,  the  deutschemark, and the  Swiss  franc.I am not sure  it  is  quantitatively significant  enough, but if  you lookat  what has  happened to  the prices  of  the  Brady bonds,  it  has  to meanthat  there has been a big shift  in  the  ex-ante  demand for  thoseinstruments  over  this period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  One  of  the  central  banks  that we  oughtto be  concerned about  other than the  Bundesbank and the Bank of  Japan,as  large  holders  of  dollars  that  they are not  going  to  relinquish, isthe  Bank  of  Taiwan.  It  holds close to  $90  billion in  Eurodollars  anddirect  claims  against  the U.S.,  largely in Treasury securities.  Theyare  traders,  needless  to  say.  Whereas  it  is  fairly difficultpolitically and strategically  in  the  context  of  the G-7  to have majorshifts  in dollar holdings by  either  the  Bank of  Japan or  theBundesbank, I am not  sure  there  is  terribly much inhibition  in  thatlarge  sort  of bloated stock of  securities  sitting  out  there.  We havesome  data;  I haven't  looked at  it.  What proportion of  their holdingsof U.S.  Treasuries  are short-term Treasury bills?  Do  you know?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We wouldn't have  the  data unless  they are  heldat  the  New York Bank.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We have  data on  what  they hold with us  ascustodian, but  that  is  only  a portion of what  most  central  banks  hold.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Have you checked the  data?3/28/95-15-

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't have  an exact view.  I don't  have  any ofthose data here.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Peter,  what has  happened  to  the  totalcustodian holdings  of Treasury securities  in the  last  10  weeks  or  so?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  In  the  last  10  weeks  they have gone up.  We  hadan  extraordinary rise  of  $10  billion  in  one reporting  period.  Therehas been  some  back and  forth movement  in such holdings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  that  because of  the Caribbean--?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No,  it  didn't  include  the  Caribbean.  The marketall  read  it  as  entirely the  Bank of Japan.Ironically,  it  was  to  a substantial  extent  other Asian centralbanks  who  were thought  to be sellers  of  dollars.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Who  in  fact were buying dollars!

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Who  just  happened  to be  shifting.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  You  have  to  remember  that  as  a statisticalmatter  they can move  investments  from Eurodollar holdings  to  theFederal  Reserve Bank of  New York and that  will  show up as  custodianholdings  but  it  doesn't have  any currency  implications at  all.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We  did have  a period when  our custodial  accountswent  down quite  a bit,  net,  but  I haven't  looked  at  the  figures.There was  a period where some  of  the Asian  central  banks----went  into bills,  came  out  of  them, and wentback.  That  created some  volatility  in our  custody holdings.  So  thoseholdings probably  are  a little  higher  over  the past  10  or  20  weeks,but  not dramatically,  I would  think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I assume  there  is  no  concern about  theAmerican dollar  in  the  context  of  our holding  dollars as  custodiansfor  foreign official  accounts!  I only got  a chuckle  out  of  the ViceChairman!

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  That  was with my President  of  theFederal Reserve  Bank  of  New York hat  on.  That's  why I chuckled.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I realize that.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  If  I could comment,  going  back to  the reservecurrency  status  issue,  it  is  interesting  that  the  markets  all  chatterabout how the  dollar  is  losing  its  reserve  currency  status.  Yet,  thedollar bill  is  in heavy demand  around  the world.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mean  the hundred  dollar bill?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The hundred  dollar bill,  yes. The  greenback.It's  an  interesting offset  to  the  concept  that  the  dollar  is  losingits  reserve currency  status.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions  for  Peter?3/28/95-16-

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Peter,  I understand  that  some  Fed watchers,  intrying to  decide whether to  blame  the  Federal  Reserve  for  the weaknessof  the  dollar, have pointed  to  the  fact  that  the  dollar price  of  goldhas not  gone  up very much while the mark and yen prices  of gold havegone down.  On that basis  they pretty much  absolve us  from blame  andsay  it's  more  of  a mark and yen problem  than  it  is  a dollar problem.Do you  take any comfort  in  that view?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  A  tiny tiny bit.  I don't particularly![Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  To what  degree  do you  think we have  a dollarproblem as  opposed  to  a mark and yen problem?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think we have  a dollar problem, as  Imentioned, in the way the  foreign exchange market  looks  at  therelationship between  our  interest rates  and our  current  account.  Idon't mean  that  should  drive the  policy decided  around  this  table,  butthat  is  the  chain around our  ankle,  if  you will,  that we have  to dealwith;  it's  the  load we  are carrying.  The  mark is  at  extraordinaryhighs  on  a trade-weighted basis.  The  mark clearly  is  strong--howeverdefined--against us,  against  Europe,  against everybody.  There  also  isa problem of  an  ever appreciating yen.  Now, something may break thatat  some point,  but until  it  does  I think there  are problems  in  eachcorner;  each  leg of  this  stool  has  its  own problem.  And that  in myview is  how we get  the  historic  lows  or  historic highs--when there  issomething  that  is pushing  the  exchange rate  on both sides  in the  samedirection.

MR. TRUMAN.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  either gentleman?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike, in  terms  of  the growth  rates  for thebaseline forecast  of  real GDP,  it  looks  like  almost a perfect  softlanding  in some  respects.  But  as  one  focuses more on what  the  economylooks  like  in  1996,  it  seems  to me  that  there are  some very troublingaspects,  particularly  if  one  considers what  a simulation  for  1997might produce.  For  example,  we  see  that  at  the  end of  the  year theunemployment rate  is  below conventional  estimates  of  the natural  rate.That  suggests  to me  that  if  we  were to  simulate  through  1997 weprobably would have  higher  inflation.  Therefore, the  conclusion  isthat  on  the  baseline forecast we not  only are making no  progresstoward reducing  inflation, we actually are going  to  see  a period  ofthree years  in which  inflation at  best would  stay about  flat,  but  interms  of  models most  likely would worsen.  Is  that  a correctassumption?

MR. PRELL.  Reading  the  numbers  as precisely as  they arewritten down,  the  thrust  of  the  baseline forecast  is  that  we  think wehave a modest  degree of  financial  restraint  that will  hold growthslightly below potential  and have  the  unemployment rate  creep up.  Butwe are  at a point where we  think high  levels  of  resource utilizationwill begin to  foster very gradually some momentum toward higherinflation.  So, yes,  the most  natural  extrapolation from  this  would bea slightly higher rate  of  inflation  in  1997.

MR.  PARRY.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mike,  I guess  I am a little  surprised  at youranswer to  Bob,  and that  intrigues me  some because my question relatedto  the  almost  "too good  to  be  true"  sort  of pattern  for  nominal  GDPgrowth through  the  next two  years  and the composition  of  prices--whether  the  deflator or  the  CPI--and output.  If  I understand it,  yourassumption  is  that  the  fed  funds  rate  stays  at  6 percent  for  the  fulleight quarters.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That  is  correct.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  You have  long bond yields  coming down somewhatfurther.  You don't  say how much, but  I assume you still  have anupward sloping yield curve  through  the  whole  two-year period.3/28/95-18-

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Essentially, we would  have  an upward  slope  ofaverage  dimension.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Some  liquidity premium  in  there?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  So  you have nominal  spending  rising at  a  rate  ofless  than 5  percent  for  eight quarters  and pretty much a  flat patternthrough  1996.  It's  not much  different  from the  last  severalGreenbooks  except  that  at  least  it's  flat now whereas before  itdropped this  year  and rose  later.  So,  to  decompose  nominal  spendinginto  its parts,  you have  real  output  rising  a  little  less  than 2-1/2percent  on  average and prices  also  rising a  little  less  than 2-1/2percent,  using the  deflator  anyway,  to  give you  that nominal  spending.Yet,  you have a  structure  of  interest  rates  in which  rates  are  6percent  and  higher throughout  the  yield curve  for  the  whole  eight-quarter period.  I  look  at  that  and say  I  don't  know whether  it's  agood  forecast  or  a  bad forecast.  I  certainly  don't  have a  differentone  to  propose, but  in  the  sense  of  a  "reasonableness" check,  should  Iexpect nominal  interest  rates  to  be  in  the  6  to  7  percent  range whilenominal  spending  is  under 5  percent  for  a  two-year period?  Comment?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  If  you are  asking whether  the  relationship  ofnominal  interest  rates  to  nominal  growth  looks  abnormal  orunreasonable  here,  I  would say  that  there  is  not  a  very strongregularity  in  the history of  the  relationship between nominal  interestrates  and nominal  GDP  growth.  We have played around with someeconometric  exercises  to  see  whether  there  is  any  information  to  begained by looking at  that  spread  as  an  index of  restraint  andprospective real  economic  activity.  It  is  weak.  It  can  contribute alittle  to  explaining  the  prospects.  I  don't  feel  uncomfortable withthis  forecast.  I  think  the  fact  that  the  nominal  interest  rate  is  alittle higher than nominal GDP  growth  is  consistent  with our  sensethat  this  is putting  some  drag  on economic  activity,  just  as  the  factthat  the  real  short-term rate,  a  bit  above  historical averages  as  weperceive  it,  could be  interpreted as  being consistent  with some  modestmonetary restraint  on  top  of  what we believe  to  be  some moderatefiscal  restraint.  That  is  very hard  to  say.  The  real  rate  ofinterest  could vary  considerably over  a  cycle  or  even a  little  longer.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  If  I  could  follow up--one  thing  implicit  in boththe  assumptions  and  the  forecast and your  responses  to  me  and  to  BobParry earlier  is  that  either  the  financial markets  are  embodying  andmaintaining  a  higher  inflation premium  for a  sustained period  of  timethan what we  are  observing  or we have  a  higher real  yield.  I  takethis  as  being a  forecast  of  an  economy  that  is  operating  for  the  nexttwo  years  essentially at  full  employment  or  full  capacity.  We  areright  at  the  ceiling over this  whole period.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We  are  slightly above  the  ceiling now, driftingback toward  the ceiling.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay, but  at  least  not below it.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  are  splitting hairs here.3/28/95-19-

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  So you would say  it  is  unlikely that  the  realyield embodied in  financial  instruments  is  higher  than  what  theeconomy  is  actually churning out or  capable  of  churning out.  Unlessyou have  some  sort  of  risk or  uncertainty assumption in  there,  thatimplies  that  the market  is  maintaining an inflation premium.  Marketparticipants  are still  looking out beyond this  forecast horizon at  arate of  inflation and  that  is  still  being  embedded in nominal yields.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Let me  separate these questions.  In  some  simplemodels,  one  can relate  the  observed real  rate of  interest  to  thelonger-term growth  of  the  economy as  a sort  of  equilibrium, steadystate  condition.  But  if  one  starts  elaborating  those models,  it  canget much more  complicated.  On  the  question of  what we  think  is  goingon with inflation  expectations,  yes,  our presumption is  that  thecurrent  inflation  expectation  for  the  shorter run  is  in  the 3 percent--3 percent plus--area for  consumer prices.  As  we  go  out  into  theintermediate-term--5  to  10  years--expectations are probably closer  to4 percent  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  At  this point, in  our  judgment,  the  notion of  adownward trend to  inflation  is  not  embedded in  the  markets.  Rather,there  is  some more  inflation  in  the works,  as  President  Parry wassuggesting.  Our  forecast  is  pointing toward some  gradual pickup to  ahigher  level  of  inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other questions?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I did have a question, but  I am again pickingup on  Bob Parry, especially on the  answer  to  his  question.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Picking  on him or  picking up on  him?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  No, picking up on him--definitely not pickingon him.  Inspired by him.  Mike,  referring  to  your answer  to  Bob,  Iwas  reading the  quarterly Greenbook numbers  on the capacityutilization rate.  They peak at  85.1  and they go  down every  singlequarter  through  1996  Q4,  at  that  point reaching 82.9.  I can'timagine,  though  I thought  I heard you say  "yes"  in your answer  to Bob,that  if  this page were  another two  inches wide  and we  saw  the numbersfor  1997  on  it,  that  the utilization rate would  abruptly turn back up.Again, I am reading this  just  the way you stated  it,  Mike, with theeconomy gradually going back to  its  natural  growth  rate, which doesnot  lead  to  ever  accelerating  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Indeed.  But  in  1997,  assuming gradualconvergence, we are  as  I said splitting hairs.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  You already have  5.8  percent  unemployment  and82.9  capacity utilization by  the end of  1996.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Exactly, and in  1997  on  this  trajectory, we wouldget  back to  the NAIRU and a little  lower on  capacity utilization.  Intheory at  that point,  the  inflation rate would stabilize  at  just  ahair higher  than we observe  as  the  trend  to  1996.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Okay.3/28/95-20-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Maybe this  is  cutting  it  too close, but  if  youlook at  the  two years  together  in  the  Greenbook, we have  a little moreinflation this year because  of  what  we have  assumed about  the dollar.Therefore,  the  flatness produces a bit  of  a distortion.  It  suggeststhat  the  trend is  very gradual,  but  there may be more  trend than  thenumbers  themselves  suggest.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We are using  the usual  sacrifice  ratios  and aNAIRU around  6 percent;  and given  our projected unemployment  rate, weare  only talking about  accelerations  of  a couple  of  tenths a year.The  convergence  by 1997  implies  that we may not  even have  that  in  thatyear.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That was  my point.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  The point  I wanted to make  was  that  clearly yourprojection  does  not  show any improvement  on  inflation;  we  are notmaking progress.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I understood  it  to be a deterioration.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further  questions?  If  not,  who wouldlike  to  start the  discussion?  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The Eleventh District has  slowed  somewhat overthe  past  few months,  and most  of  the  slowing seems  to  be  in  Texasrather than  in our parts  of  New Mexico and Louisiana.  A member of  ourAdvisory Council  on  Small Business and Agriculture said with respectto New Mexico  that  they had  "hit the  three  cherries"  there  this pastyear.  I am not  familiar with  that  terminology,  [Laughter]  but  itprobably would apply  to Louisiana whose  rebound  last year  seems  tohave a lot  to  do  with the  gaming  industry.  The picture  in Texas  ismixed;  employment  declined in January  for the  first  time  in  thirtymonths,  but  it  rebounded  in February.  The  biggest negative for  Texas,of  course,  is  the  situation in Mexico, both actual and prospective.Our  staff  has  conducted three  special  Beigebook surveys  onexpectations  about  the  impact  of Mexico's problems  on Texasbusinesses,  and each of  those  surveys  has  gotten more pessimisticabout  the  overall  impact  on Texas.  Dozens  of  retail  establishmentshave  closed in most of  our border  towns.  Unemployment  is  up  all  alongthe border.  With respect  to  Mexico  itself,  given that  their economicpolicies  in recent years have  been fundamentally sound,  the austerityprogram that  this  country apparently  has been pushing  on them seemsunnecessarily harsh  to  me  and may prove  to  be  counterproductive  in  thelong  run.As  for  the national  economy, about the  only  straw in  the windthat  I have picked up  that  others may not have picked up has  to  dowith retail  sales.  J.C. Penney, which I regard as  the  retailer to  the3/28/95-21-middle  class,  is  having in March its  second  consecutive  decline  insales.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Both  the  statistical  indicators  and ourinformal  contacts  suggest  that  the  pace of  expansion  is  slowing  in  theFirst District.  Since we never got  into  an expansionary phase  tobegin with,  this  is  not being met with great  joy around  the  District.Payroll  employment  in  the  region  grew a little more  slowly at  the endof  1994  than  it  had  earlier in  the  year and then  dropped in January.Help-wanted advertising  dropped.  At  the  same  time,  our retailcontacts,  which are really quite  a diverse set,  were almost unanimousin  reporting that  sales were  flat  to  down in  both January andweather;  again, we didn't  have much  snow this year.  But  there wasgeneral  agreement  that  the  regional  economy  is  slowing.  On  themanufacturing side,  our contacts are more positive than  the  retailers.That has  been  the  general pattern for  the  last  several months.  Amajority of  our contacts  reported increases  over  the  year ranging  fromquite modest  to  fairly strong--in the  range  of  30  percent  or so.  Butthere are  some notable  areas  of weakness:  aircraft parts, medicalequipment,  and potentially the small  volume  of manufacturing in  ourarea  that  relates  to  the  auto  industry.  The price picture  remains  asbefore.  Prices  are  generally stable but  there  are major  exceptions  inthe  areas  of  paper, plastics,  and leather  in particular.  Residentialconstruction has  slowed  in  our  region as  it  apparently has  elsewhere,but  the  potential  for  nonresidential  construction is  solid, both  as wesee  it  happening  right now and in  the  future.  Vacancy rates  in Bostonare now about  10  percent, which  is  a level  that,  at  least  earlier  inthe  1990s,  nobody predicted would happen over  the next  10  years.  Itdowntown Boston,  then  on  the  circumferential  highways  of  128  and 495.By way of  contrast--and New England has  really been an area  ofcontrasts  throughout  this recovery--Hartford vacancy rates  are  in  themid-20 percent range  and still  rising.Two  major items  of  economic  interest have  dominated theregional  news.  The  first  of  these  is  the  report  of  the  commission onmilitary base  closings--the defense  industry in  the New England regionis  about  1 in  10  jobs--and the  second  is  the proposed Fleet-Shawmutmerger.  Hanscomb Air  Force Base,  which  is  in eastern Massachusetts,was not  on  the  closing  list  to  the  great  relief  of many inMassachusetts.  If  the  initial  recommendations  are  approved andHanscomb continues  in  operation,  it  will  add slightly to  jobs  in theregion  rather than  take  away something  like  11,000  jobs.  The Fleet-Shawmut  merger has prompted at  least  two  state  attorneys  general  tothreaten some  sort  of  action--we are not  really sure what--over  theloss  of  jobs  as  a result  of  efficiency measures  expected after  themerger.  So  far,  Connecticut  appears  to  have negotiated a deal  to keepcertain  jobs  that would otherwise have been cut,  and I am  sureMassachusetts has  this  in mind  as well.  We have  not  seen  a draftapplication, which I think is  being held up because  of  the  complexityof  some  of  the  competitive  issues  involved in  this merger.Turning to  the  Greenbook,  I must  say  that  I have  someconcerns  along the  lines  that  Bob  Parry was suggesting.  We  findourselves  in agreement  with the  basic GDP growth  rates  shown in  the3/28/95-22-baseline  forecast.  But when we use  these  growth rates,  our ownprojections  of  unemployment  are  slightly lower  than the  Greenbook'sand our estimates  of  inflation  growth are  a bit higher.  Moreimportantly, we  don't  see  the  level  of  inflation  stabilizing nextyear.  I know there  is  a tradeoff  in  terms of  the  impact  from theexternal sector, but we don't  see that  level  of  stability in  terms  ofrates  of  inflation growth  in  1996.  We  see a gradual  uptick, which isconsistent with our projections  of unemployment.  We believe  that  thecore  trend  is  rising,  which is  discussed in  the  Greenbook.  Therefore,we  think and maybe others believe  as well,  that  there  is  a bit  ofupside  risk in  the  degree  of  inflationary pressure  in  the baselineforecast,  particularly  as we  take  it  out  through  1996.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, growth  in  the  Twelfth Districteconomy  as  a whole remains  moderately strong.  The  District'sunemployment  rate has  dropped  1-1/2  percentage points  in  the past  12months.  The  intermountain  states  have experienced very rapid growth,although we have seen  some moderation recently.  In California,  themodest  recovery may gain some  momentum this year.  Revised payrollemployment  data  for  California show  that  the recovery so  far has  beencharacterized by a rebound  in construction,  recent  strength in non-aerospace manufacturing, and continued growth  in  services.  Payrollemployment  in  southern California now is  growing  at  the  fastest paceamong  the  regions  in California  after  falling at  the  fastest  rateduring  the  recession.While overall  conditions  remain  strong  in  the  District,several  special  factors will  damp growth  in  some  areas.  InCalifornia, the  estimated damage  from March  rains  and floods  isexpected to  reach  $2 billion,  including  $400  million in  crop  losses.The  recent  storms  also  will depress  state  employment,  constructionactivity, and retail sales.  Recent developments  in Mexico  likely arebeginning to  restrain growth  in  California and Arizona.  Arizona'sdependence  on  trade with Mexico  is  about  three  times  the  nationalaverage, while California's dependence  is  about  1-1/2  times  thenation's.  To  date,  the anecdotal  evidence confirms  initial  estimatesthat  developments in Mexico will  reduce growth  in U.S.  real  GDP by afew  tenths  of  a percentage point  in  1995--Ted  indicated roughly athird of  a percent  in his  forecast--which implies  a moderate-sizedshock to  both California and Arizona.  However, I must admit  there  isconcern that  a severe  recession in Mexico  could bring  about moresubstantial  effects on  these states,  particularly as  one  gets  closerand closer to  the Mexican  border.  In Washington  State,  the widelypublicized cutbacks  at  Boeing will  hold down employment  in  the nearterm.  However, it  appears  to  us  that  these cutbacks are  moreindicative of  a restructuring effort  than  of  a downturn in  the  longer-run outlook for  aircraft production in  the  state  of Washington.If  I may turn briefly  to  the  national economy,  the broadcontour of  our  forecast  is  similar  to  that of  the  Greenbook, althoughwe  seem to  have differences  that  are very similar  to  those mentionedby President  Minehan.  Throughout  this  year, the  economy most likelywill  remain  above  levels  of  labor  and capacity utilization that  areconsistent with steady  inflation, despite  a slowing of  growth  in realGDP.  Thus, we  anticipate that  inflation will  increase a bit  this yearand next.  Of  course,  there  is  always  considerable uncertainty in  such3/28/95-23-forecasts  and this  is  a particularly important  consideration  at  thisearly stage  of  a slowdown in  growth  that now appears  to  be under way.I find  it  interesting that  several  of  the  spending equations  in ourmodel  are predicting  levels  that  are below  the actual  data  in thefourth quarter,  suggesting that  there may be  some  downside risks  tothe  real  side  of  the  forecast.  Moreover, I guess we  have all  notedthat  forecasts  from  a model  often underpredict  the  amplitude ofcyclical movements in  the  economy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  Seventh District manufacturingactivity remained brisk in  recent months, but  there were signs  ofmoderation in  some  of  the  interest rate-sensitive  industries,  notablyautos  and single-family housing.  Sales of  autos  and  light  trucks  inadjusted, annual  rate, which was below industry forecasts  as  well  asour own  forecast.  Auto makers  responded quickly by  cutting  first- andsecond-quarter assembly schedules.  In  line with the  Greenbook, we nowexpect  light vehicle  output  to  add very little  to  first-quarter GDPand probably subtract  at  least  a full  percentage point  from second-quarter growth.  It  is  important  to  keep in mind that April  is  acritical month  for the  auto  industry because  that  is  when  theydetermine their model  year build-out.  Once  they determine  the  numberof units produced, they then  apply the  incentives  necessary to  sellthem  for  the  remainder  of  the model year.  Recent reports  from  the  BigThree  auto makers  as  well  as  from  District  auto  dealers  anddistributors  suggest  that  light vehicle  sales  have  improved in March,perhaps  to  as much as  a 15-1/2  million unit rate, with  sales  increasesconcentrated among those  models where  incentives  have been enhanced.I emphasize,  "as much as."  However,  it will  take  another  month or  sobefore we  know whether  the  early 1995  softness  in lighter  vehiclesales reflects what one  industry contact called  "the pause  thatrefreshes"  or  whether there  has been a more permanent  pullback on  thepart  of  consumers.Single-family housing  is  the  other major  industry that  showedoutright weakness  in early  1995.  But  this  is  being countered bygrowing multifamily and commercial  construction activity.  Inaddition, we have had a few reports  that recent  declines  in mortgageinterest rates may have mitigated some  of  the  softening  in mortgagedemand and existing home sales.  We are  all  aware  that  sales  ofMichael Jordan's  new number 45  Chicago Bulls  jersey have beenexceptionally strong recently,  [Laughter]  but  overall  retail  salesgrowth  in the  District has  slowed  from the  fourth-quarter pace.District reports  on March-to-date  sales  suggest no  change  from  themoderating pace  set  in January  and February.  Apart from  apparel,inventories  are  not  seriously out  of  line with desired  levels,although an  increasing number of  retailers  in our  February Michigansurvey reported rising stocks.  Price discounting continues  to  bepervasive and competition  intense.The  District's manufacturing sector outside  autos  continuesto  expand at  a robust pace.  District  steel production  in the  firstquarter will post  its  second  largest year-over-year gain  since  the  endof  the  1990-1991 recession.  However,  confidential information we  haveon  the Chicago Purchasing Managers  Index, which will be  released tothe public  this Friday--I  emphasize  that  this  is  confidential  until3/28/95-24-Friday--will  indicate a significant  slowing  in  the pace of  expansionduring March as  well  as a slight  easing  in prices-paid  inflation.  Iwould add that,  on  the  other hand, the  tone  of  our recent  meeting ofthe Advisory Council  on Agriculture,  Labor and Small Business  wasquite positive, with representatives  indicating that  their smallbusiness  contacts still  expect  growth in  1995  to  be  in  line with  thatin  1994.  The agricultural  sector  is  stronger than we  had expected.Farm land values  continue to  rise.  There was  a 6-1/2  percent  increasein District  farm land values  last  year, and that  was the  largestannual gain  in  six years.  January and February unit  sales  of  farmtractors and  combines were  the strongest  since  1984  and were up nearly10  percent  from a year  ago.  On  the employment  front,  labor marketsremain very  tight.  Help wanted  ads continue to  climb  in  the region,and the  survey of  Midwest employers  indicates  further  strengthening inhiring plans.  Virtually all  of  our contacts  in  the personnel  supplyindustry report  difficulties  finding workers  to  meet  the needs  oftheir customers.  Our  directors  as  well  as  the members  of  our AdvisoryCouncil  express  significant  concerns  about  labor  shortages,particularly in  the  state of  Indiana.  One of  our  directors  fromIndiana  told of  a help wanted ad being placed offering  a sign-up bonusof  $200.  By mistake,  the  ad ran with an extra  0, offering a $2,000bonus, and  it ran  for  two  days  before they realized it.  They had  atotal  of  three  responses  to  the  ad!  Overall  developments  in  theSeventh District, while  upbeat  in many respects,  are  graduallybeginning to  reflect  some  of  the mixed signals  observed around  thenation.Our  appraisal  of  the  national  economic picture  is  verysimilar  to  the Greenbook's.  In  general,  we concur with  its  forecastof  slower  real  growth  combined with a modest but  increasing rate  ofCPI  inflation.

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  reports  coming out  of  ourDistrict, which I would remind you  is  the District where MichaelJordan came  from originally--  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  He's  now in  Chicago.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  These reports  continue  to  show some  slowing  inthe  regional  economy.  We  do,  of  course,  conduct monthly manufacturingand  service  sector  surveys,  and for  the  latest  two months both  surveysare consistent with some  general  softening  in activity in  our region.Our  directors, while  they  are  still broadly optimistic,  are presentingmore  balanced comments  now on  local  and regional  conditions  thanearlier when  almost all  of  their  comments emphasized the  strength inbusiness  activity.  Let me give  you a couple  of quick  examples.  Thecentral North Carolina area  around  the  cities of  Durham and Raleighhas been the  strongest  local  economy  in  our District, probably aboutthe  strongest  local  area in  the  entire  country.  Activity there  isstill  strong, but we are  seeing some  signs  of  softening there.  Home3/28/95-25-sales  are weaker  than they were;  automobile sales  and sales  of  otherdurables are  also  a bit weaker.  As  another example,is  on  the board of  a large national  apparel  retailer.  Inthat  role,  she watches  consumer trends  not only  in the  apparelindustry specifically but  more generally, and she  is  not veryoptimistic  about  the outlook  for consumer spending either  regionallyor nationally.To summarize  by sector in  our District:  Retail  activityclearly has weakened since  the  beginning of  the  year;  manufacturingalso has moderated, although a good bit  less;  and both residential  andcommercial real  estate  activity have been  flat over recent weeks,  butsome  leasing  agents have  told us  that  the market  for prime  officespace has  become  a good bit  tighter  over  the last  few months.  Thereis  some closing of  the  gap  there.The  situation in our  region, of  course,  is  broadly consistentwith developments at  the national  level.  Much of  the  national datasince our  last meeting, as we  all  know, clearly suggests  that  theexpansion  is  beginning to  moderate.  I think the  most compellingevidence  of  that  is  in  the  retail sales  data.  Further  evidence isprovided by some  of  the  latest  residential  construction  information,especially the decline  in single-family starts  to  the  lowest  level  inabout  two  years.  In my view these developments  clearly have beenreflected  in  financial markets.  Despite  the recent  acceleration  incore CPI,  bond rates  have come  down.  I think that  certainly can be  anindication of  some reduction  in  inflation expectations, presumably onthe  grounds  that slower  growth will  reduce  the  pressures  on  resourceutilization and hence  on cost  and prices  going  forward.Against that  background, the downward revision in  theGreenbook's projections  for  the  first  half  of  this  year and,  ofcourse,  the  substantial  downward revision  for the  first  quarter, arereasonable.  One  can support  the revised projection analytically  in  avariety of  ways.  In particular,  it  is  consistent with the permanentincome hypothesis,  which is  a model  that  many economists now findpersuasive  in  thinking about consumer behavior.  As  you know, eventhough consumer outlays  have diminished  lately, income growth has beenwell  maintained.  The  saving rate  rose significantly  in the  finalquarter of  last year, and if  current  trends persist, we are  going toget  the  same kind  of  increase  in the  current  quarter.  The permanentincome hypothesis  implies  that households will  save  more  if  theyexpect  income  to grow more slowly  in  the  future,  and of  course,  thatis  consistent with the Greenbook's  scenario.  In  that  regard, I mightjust  note that  one of  our  economists,  Peter  Ireland, recentlydeveloped a projection  for  real  disposable  labor  income  for  this  year,1995,  using a VAR model  that  is  really driven by the saving  rate.  Hisprojection  is  consistent  with the Greenbook projection using  a verydifferent model  of  the  economy.  So,  again,  I think the  broad profileof  the  Greenbook's  near-term projections  is  certainly plausible.Having  said all  of  this,  I think  that  the risks  in  theoutlook, while certainly more  balanced than  they were  earlier, arestill  skewed a bit  to  the up  side.  I think we have  to keep  in mindthat  a lot  of  talk and  focus has  been on  the  softer  data in  someareas,  but not  all  the  recent data have been soft.  In particular,employment has  expanded sharply  over the  last  three months.  It  is  up3/4  of  a million  jobs  over that period.  That  is  an  annual growth  rate3/28/95-26-of  2-1/2  percent, which  clearly  is  significantly higher  than  what  isconsistent with longer-term noninflationary  trend growth  inemployment.  Also,  industrial production was  strong enough  in  Februaryto push  the  capacity utilization index back up again.  It  is  now atthe highest  level  since  1979,  if  my figures  are  right  on that.  Andperhaps  most  importantly, I am  impressed by  the continued strength ofbusiness  fixed  investment,  which is  a forward-looking  indicator, atleast  in  some  sense.  So,  again,  I think the  upside  risk is  stillthere  and we should not  lose  sight  of  that.  I just  hope we  keep thatin  the  back of  our minds going  forward.

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman, the  economy in  the  Southeasthas  continued  to expand  in  the  first  quarter, although we  are  seeingsome  signs  of  slowing  from last year's  very strong  fourth quarter.Employment growth  accelerated in January, and preliminary Februarydata  suggest both strong  employment growth and a further  decline  inthe  District unemployment  rate.  We  are now forecasting  anunemployment rate  in  the  District of  4.7 percent  when we get  the  finaldata.  There  are,  of  course, signs  of  deceleration as  I haveindicated, although I don't  view any  of  these  as  being  signs  of  realweakness in  any  sense.  The  slowing that we  have had  is  pretty muchalong  the  lines  of  what we have  heard  from others  for  the  rest of  thecountry.  Retail  sales  were quite disappointing to  retailers  inthe  early March data point  to  some  recovery.  Automobile  sales  havebeen declining  since  1994,  and single-family home  sales  continued tofall  through  early March and are now below year-ago  levels.Manufacturing activity as  reported in our manufacturing  surveysoftened a bit in  February--that is  both  in  terms  of production andshipments--and some  of  this  slowing has  been attributed  to  thesituation in Mexico.  But  other reports  suggest  that  inventoryshortages  in  several  industries  are  contributing some  strength.  Thatis  especially true  in  chemicals, paper,  and packaging.  In Tennessee,the  auto  plants  are operating at  full  capacity as  are  the packagingand paperboard facilities  throughout the  District.  The  strongestincreases  reported to  us  are  in communications  equipment.On the  inflation  side,  there has  been some  abatement  of  rawmaterials price increases,  and as  I have been reporting for  severalmonths, where  there have been materials price  increases,  theygenerally have not been passed  through  to  the  intermediate or  consumerlevels.  We still  are hearing  stories  of  labor  shortages  and we  toohave  heard of  signing bonuses,  although not  quite the  size  of  thaterroneous  figure reported by Mike Moskow.  Wage  increases  are  stillpretty  spotty around  the  District.Travel  and tourism are  quite mixed, with business  andconvention travel  to  Florida, New Orleans, and the  Gulf  Coast  ofMississippi  especially  strong.  But  in general  tourism  in  Floridaremains  very lackluster.  Tourism around the major baseball  springcamps  has been in  decline, as you would imagine.  Traffic  to  Floridafrom Latin America, again not unexpectedly, has  slowed.  And Europeanvisitors are  still  scarce, but  that  is  showing  some hints  of  turningaround.  One  of  our directors  from Florida  did report  that  Germanvisitors are not necessarily all  tourists  because  they are buying  thehigh-priced homes  in Palm Beach.  The  Germans  are moving  in very3/28/95-27-aggressively and  the  $2 million  and above  houses are  now flying theGerman  flag.  In Atlanta, the  Olympics  are beginning to  have aneffect,  both  in  terms  of  infrastructure and construction  for  thevenues.With respect  to  the national economy, we  see  underlyingmomentum in  the  economy as  still  being pretty  strong.  The  signs  ofweakness  or deceleration  that  we do have  seem  somewhat unpersuasive  tome in  the  face  of  the  resilient  fundamentals  that  seem to  exist  in  theeconomy.  That  is,  employment and income  are  still quite  strong, as  AlBroaddus just mentioned.  New orders  have been strong,  as  has beenbusiness  fixed  investment.  I am particularly  impressed by the plansthat  I see  for  more  industrial  capacity coming  on line  this year  andnext.  Of  course, as  I have  indicated, we do  see  some moderation, butless  than  in the  Greenbook.  And our differences with the  Greenbookare  the same  as  they were  last  time.  That is,  we anticipate  somewhatstronger growth with somewhat  higher  inflation.  We  see  the inflationrate moving up  in  1995  to  3.5 percent, but  expect  it  to peak at  thatlevel.We have had some discussion about  the  dollar  this  morning,Mr. Chairman, and I thought  I would interject  just  one  comment on  thatsubject.  Although I found  Peter's  description of  the  reasons  for  thedollar  decline  quite persuasive,  I still  am not  entirely clear  in mymind what  the  real  reasons  are.  There  are probably many, but I don'tthink we really know  categorically what  they are.  More  importantlyfor  us  is  the  question of  what  impact  the  lower dollar will  have onthe  economy.  It  seems  to me  that  there  may be  few tangiblerepercussions  for  real  activity and prices  if  the  dollar  stabilizesaround  current  levels.  Perhaps  this  is  preaching to  the  choir  to  someextent,  but  I think  as  a matter  of principle we  should not  beadjusting policy to  achieve some particular  external value  of  thedollar.  In  some  sense,  I believe  this  is  one of  the  reasons we have  aflexible  exchange rate.  The dollar  is  a signal,  although a noisy one,but  I don't  think  it  should be a target.  Thank you.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  the Tenth District economy remainsstrong,  with strength  evident  throughout  the region.  Our  directorsare uniformly reporting  robust  growth in  all District states.Moreover, recently revised employment  data confirm  the  strength of  theDistrict economy.  Nonfarm jobs  were up  4.2  percent  in January  overthe  previous year.  New Mexico,  for  example, continues  to  rank amongthe  top states  in  terms  of  job growth.  Six  of  our seven  Districtstates are  experiencing job growth  above  the national  average.Manufacturing  is  a leading  source of  economic  strength;  factories  inthe  region  are generally operating  at high  levels  of  capacity.Durable  goods makers  have been adding  jobs  at  a rapid pace.  Retailsales  are generally buoyant  across  the  region, although automobilesales have  shown  some weakness recently.  In  the  construction sector,a recent  surge  in office construction has  more  than offset  the  slowingin  the housing sector.  Notwithstanding  the  recent  strength that  I amreporting, there  are  signs  that  overall  activity is  beginning to  slow.Our  quarterly survey of manufacturers  suggests  that activity has begunto  cool  somewhat.  Fewer  factory managers are  reporting gains  inproduction and shipments  than was  the  case  last  fall.  Also, loangrowth  in District banks has moderated  lately from the  rapid growth of3/28/95-28-the  fourth quarter  last year.  Manufacturers  report  steady increasesin prices  of  materials, with more of  these hikes being passed throughto  final product prices.  Reports of  wage pressures,  however, arestill  isolated.Turning to  the  national economy, recent  signs  of  moderationin economic  activity to  a more  sustainable  level  are,  of  course,welcome.  But whether  that moderation will be  sufficient  to  capinflation--to echo what  others have  said--is  still  an open  question.I believe  that,  on balance,  there  is  upside  risk  to  the  forecast overthe year as  a whole.  I would like  to mention  some  of  the  reasons.The  interest-sensitive  sectors  of  the economy may show more strengththan was projected, particularly  if  the recent  run-up  in  bond pricesis  sustained.  Notwithstanding  Mexico and South America, export  growthFirms may be  more aggressive  in  investing in  new plant  and equipment,especially given their capacity  levels,  and less  aggressive in paringinventory growth  than  we currently believe.  Moreover,  recent nationalbank lending  data are  consistent with an  economy  that  is  still  growingat  a fairly  strong pace.  As  for  inflation,  I agree  that  the corelevel  of  the CPI  is  likely to move up  to  the  3-1/4  percent  range thisyear.  But  if  the  economy comes  in  stronger than  expected and if  thedollar  continues  to  weaken,  I think inflation could move  higher.  I donot  look for  much help on  the  labor  cost  side  because  traditionallylabor  cost movements  have  lagged inflation movements,  suggesting thatthe  best news  on this  front  may be behind us.  The  implication in myview is  that  the  risks continue  to  lie  on the  side of  inflationarypressures.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

MR. JORDAN.  The Fourth District  is  operating at  a very highlevel of  economic  activity, though  clearly the  rate of  change hasslowed.  Directors  and other  contacts consistently report  thatbusiness  is  not  growing as  fast  as  last  year, but  there are very fewindications  of anything declining in an  absolute sense  or  evenconcerns  of  such.  Motor vehicles are  quite strong.  However, thedealers  are now telling us  that  they have  as much in  inventory as  theywant,  and they are  sending messages back to  the  manufacturers  to  slowthe  rate of  shipments.  How  the manufacturers  will respond  to  that  interms  of  production  is  going to be  determined  in  the months  ahead.  Wehave  a lot  of  exporting out  of  the District although,  of  course,  agreat deal  of  it  is  to Canada.  Ohio also has  large exports  to  Mexico--Kentucky does  as  well--of auto parts.  So  far,  exporters  in  ourDistrict  are not  raising any concerns  about Mexico  as being aparticular problem because, as  our companies  tell us,  their otherexport market  for  us.  Canada  also  is  still,  for  better or worse,  astrong source  of  investment  funds  coming  into  the  region.  I am notsure why the  motivations  are all  that  attractive  from a Canadianstandpoint.  Both director reports  and direct  contacts with someretailing companies--these  are  companies  that may be headquartered inour District and operate  all  over  the  country--tell  us  that  there hasbeen a slowing in  the  growth of  retail  sales, not  absolute declines.One area  of  absolute declines  is  in residential  construction.Generally, there is  a pattern of  new-start activity being below whatit  was  in  the  recent past.  Inventories  of  "for sale"  homes  seem  to belengthening.  Commercial  real  estate  construction activity has picked3/28/95-29-up compared to  last  year.  Also, industrial  spending,  for bothproductivity and capacity increases,  especially motor vehicle-relatedcapacity, is  growing.  Companies  also  tell  us  that  steel  capacitythrough  1996  and 1997  will  be very substantially increased.  Since wehave already  seen  reports  of  declines  in steel  prices,  they say  thatwe should  look forward  to  some  softness  in  the  steel  market  in  thenext couple  of years.  One area  that  is  creating a lot  of  comment, butto  me more uncertainty as  to  what  it  all  means,  is  health  careconsolidation.  We  see very large  companies  getting  together.  Peopletalk about  the  consolidations resulting  in job  losses,  but we have  notyet  seen  them materialize  in any observable way.As  for  the  national  economy, the  Greenbook's  projection thatnominal  spending growth will  slow to  the  range of  something under  5percent  this  year and next  year  looks  to  me  like  a very desirableforecast,  as  I indicated  earlier.  I don't have  any reason  to quarrelwith that.  If  I didn't  think  that  that was  going  to happen,  and if  Ithought  that  nominal  spending growth was going  to  continue  in  therange  that  it  was  last year, then  I would be  a lot more  concerned thanI am about  the prospects  for  inflation  in 1996  and beyond.  But  ifthat  forecast  of  total  spending does  materialize,  then  the  questionabout  inflation  comes  down  to  issues  about productivity growth  and theability of  this  economy to  expand.  I am not  too  disturbed about whatmight happen  in  terms  of  reported rates  of  inflation  for  1995.  Idon't  think  that monetary policy can do  much about  that anyway.  Atthis point,  I mainly would be  interested in  seeing that  the  rate  ofinflation  in  1996  and  1997  resumes  decelerating  a percentage point  ortwo  from where  it  has been  in  the  last  couple of  years.  Right  now, Idon't have  any reason  to  believe that  we are not  on  a track  to  achievethat  result.  So  I am comfortable  with the  national  forecast.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  There  are  some  clear  signs  of moderating  growthin  the  Philadelphia District.  Manufacturers  in particular  indicate aslackening pace  that  is  apparent in  new and unfilled orders as  well  ascurrent  shipments.  Retailers  report  a slowing pace  of  sales,especially in  autos  and other durables,  although I think  there isconsiderable  uncertainty among  retailers  as  to whether  this  is  just  atemporary  slackening to  be  followed by a pickup or  the beginning of  aslower trend.  Residential  sales  and construction are  in a lull  andthere  likewise  I think most  realtors  are not  sure whether  this  is  justa lull  that will pass  or  the beginning of  a long,  dry  spell.Commercial  real  estate conditions  are  soft,  but  the  cycle  seems  tohave bottomed out  in  areas  of  the  District that  show more  strength.Looking across  the  District,  even  in  those  areas where  economicactivity is  stronger than  in  others,  there  really  is  an  absence ofwage and price pressures.  They just  remain  subdued and are anonproblem.  Increasingly in  the  District,  the  outlook  for moderatinggrowth  is  becoming the  conventional wisdom,  following  the  fast  finishof  last year, which  temporarily raised spirits  that  1995  might be avery strong year.  Since  the  Philadelphia District has been a laggardduring  this  expansion, there  is  some  feeling  that  the good  times  couldhave  lasted longer--the  same view that  Cathy Minehan  finds  in NewEngland.For the  nation,  I think we need more  than the  usual  amount ofhumility about our  assessment of  the  outlook.  To  be  sure,  there are3/28/95-30-increasing  signs  of  slowing growth, but we  could be  surprised eitheron the  up side  or  the  down side.  Areas  like  inventories  or  netexports  or  consumption  expenditures all  strike me  as  having morepotential  than usual  for  surprises  for reasons  that  have beendiscussed.  How much inventory  accumulation  is  intended or  unintended?Certainly,  the  net  export outlook has  a number of  crosscurrents.Since  the  lull  in  consumption expenditures has  been mainly  in thedurables  side,  just  how temporary  is  that  or  is  it more permanent?We  are  likely to  have some  increases  in  inflation  in  1995.We need to  try  to distinguish between cyclical  increases  that  arelikely to  moderate as  the  cycle matures  and increases  of  a moreunderlying or  core character.  In  this  context,  a slowing  of  economicactivity makes  credible the  case  that we may see more of  a cyclicalincrease  than  an underlying  increase.  But  here  too, we need to  keep  afew upticks  in  inflation in  the  context  of  a cycle.  This  comes backto  the  importance of  gauging the  strength of  economic  activity, and Ithink this  is  a time  for monitoring.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let  me  comment  first  onthe national  economy.  I find myself  a little more  confident  than  Inormally am about  the  general  contour  of  the  Greenbook forecast  inpart  because, as  many people  have  commented, the  incoming data on  thenational  economy are convincing evidence  to  me  that  the  pace of  growthhas  slowed.  Those data  are  also consistent with  the  tenor  of  theanecdotes  that  I have been picking up  in  the  District  lately.  I takesome  comfort  from  the  incoming data and  the  Greenbook forecast andindeed from  our own  forecast,  because  as  recently as  a couple  ofmonths  ago  it  was  mostly a hope  and a prayer  that  growth would slow tosomething more  consistent with trend.  Now I think it  is  a little morethan  that.  I don't know where  the  risks  lie,  particularly;  I do  knowthat  the  confidence bands  around  these  forecasts,  if  one does  itrigorously, are very, very wide.  I think that  is worth bearing  inmind as we go  forward.With regard to  the Ninth District and the  anecdotes  there,first  of  all,  I think  it  is  worth  saying  that  the District economy  onbalance  remains very healthy.  But,  and there  are  some  "buts,"  thereis  no  doubt  that auto  sales,  housing  activity, and retail  salesgenerally have  slowed perceptibly.  The  sellers  are disappointed andtheir  attitudes have  soured  somewhat.  I think  they attribute  thisslowing  to  the  level  of  interest  rates  to at  least  some considerabledegree.  On  the  other  side  of  the  coin, labor  remains  in  quite shortsupply  in most  of  the  District.  This  has  not  translated  into  any realacceleration  in the  rate  of wage  inflation, but  it  does  seem to  beaffecting expansion plans and/or  current  production activity, simplydeferring  those plans or  limiting output;  I think  it  has made  adifference.  The  final  comment  I would offer  is  that  I have  a sensethat we are  in  for  some  kind of  inventory  correction.  I say that  noton  the basis  of  a lot  of  rigorous  analysis of  how production hasmatched up with consumption or  other  spending, but  mostly as  I listento  stories about  some  of  the  disappointment that  has  occurred.  Thatsuggests  to  me  that  there  are  some  inventories  around  that  peoplewould rather not  be holding, whether  they want  to  admit  it  or  not.Certainly,  the  incoming production  data  on  the  national economy have3/28/95-31-been stronger  than  the  spending data, consistent with  the  same  story.That  suggests  to me  that  an  inventory correction will  occur.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  My view is  that  the  U.S.  economycontinues  to  show  strength even  though there are  now a few  signs  thatthe  pace  of  economic activity may be slowing.  Real  GDP grew at  a 4.6percent  rate  in the  fourth quarter according  to  the most  recentestimate.  Inventories  were a net drag  on output  growth and domesticdemand was  strong.  This  combination, which was not apparent  in  theoriginal advanced GDP  report,  is  a plus  for  the  first  quarter sincethere  should be  less  risk of  a quick slowdown due  to  a quick  inventorycorrection.  Inventory-based stories  of  a slowdown have beenproblematic in  any event  over  the  last  several  quarters,  and  theinventory-to-sales ratio remains  near a historic  low.The  Eighth District economy remains  strong, and at  4.5percent, unemployment  in major District  states remains  well below thenational average.  Parts  of  the  District  continue  to  report very tightlabor market  conditions.  A recent  survey of  businesses  in theDistrict shows  that  about  as  many plan to  add employees  in  the  nextthree months  as  did at  this  time  a year  ago.  Auto production  in  theDistrict  for  the  second quarter  is  projected to  be much  stronger  thanin  either the  fourth quarter  or  the  current  quarter.  Taking  thesefacts  together, I view the  overall  picture on  the  real  side  as  one  ofa healthy  economy.It  is  not nearly  so easy  to be  sanguine about  the  inflationoutlook.  In January and February core  inflation  averaged about  4.2percent, up  substantially from  the  2.8  percent  rate we saw  in  1994.Virtually all  major  forecasters  expect  inflation  to rise  in  1995.  TheBlue Chip  consensus,  for example, puts  the  increase  in the  CPI  at  3.4percent  in 1995  and 3.6 percent  in  1996  as  compared with 2.6  percentin  1994.  Longer-term forecasts  of  inflation  are worrisome from  theperspective of  this Committee because  they  indicate  that marketparticipants  expect  inflation at  or  above  its  current  level  athorizons  as  long  as  five years.  A recent University of Michigansurvey put inflation  expectations at  just  over 4 percent  for  5 to  10years  from now.  I might  add that  this  troubling  figure  is  actuallydown  from 5 percent  late  last year.  This  indicates  that  we are  movingin  the  right  direction, but it  is  clear  that  few  in the  marketplacebelieve our  commitment  to  long-term price  stability.  In  thisenvironment,  it  is  particularly important  that we  ask ourselves  whatour  objectives  are.  Even  if we  have put a cap  on  inflation  in the  3to  4 percent  range--and  I am not  sure  that  that  is  necessarily clearat  this point--we  are  a long way from  our goal  of  stable prices  andthe  low long-term interest  rates  that would accompany such anachievement.  The  U.S. government borrowed long  term at  4 percent  inthe  late  1950s  and the  early 1960s when  inflation was  held to  the  0 to2 percent  range  in this  country.  The  Japanese government can nowborrow  long  term  at  4 percent when  its  inflation  rate  is  comparablylow.  We  clearly have  a long way to  go  to  establish that  kind  ofcredibility again.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, the  Second Districteconomy, which has been flat  for about  the  last  six months, had alittle positive flurry, mainly  in New York State,  in February withretail  sales  and employment  up  a bit.  However,  the  continuingannouncement  of  shrinkage by major employers,  the difficulties  on WallStreet,  and certain base  closings would lead one  to  believe that  forthe  rest  of  the  year  the  economy  in  the  District  is  likely to be  flat.Regarding the  national economy, we,  like  everybody else,  areuncertain as  to where  the  economy  is  going--whether it  has  slowedenough to  sustain a reasonable level  of  growth and progress  towardprice stability.  On  the positive side, we have  consumer  spendingmoderating, retail sales  down, auto  sales  down, a little  fall  in  theMichigan index of  consumer  sentiment,  housing starts decliningsubstantially, exports to Mexico  and Latin America decreasing, andwage growth  continuing to  be moderate indeed.  On the  other hand, onehas to  look at  the  fact  that  in  recent years we have  had a pattern ofa first-quarter slowdown  followed by a strong rebound, and none of  uscan be certain  that  that won't  happen again.  Employment  growth isstill quite  strong.  The stock market  is  very strong  indeed and thelong bond rates have  declined.  Capacity utilization  is  still  above  85percent  and employment below 5-1/2  percent.  CPI  inflation has  creptup  in recent months.Regarding  any differences with the Greenbook  forecast,  we  dohave differences  that  are somewhat  troubling  in  that we  have  the  realGDP growth  rate  slightly higher  in  1995  and somewhat  lower,  down  toabout  2 percent,  in  1996.  But  the unemployment  rate  is  still  low,  andwe  are  less  sanguine about wage pressures.  Consequently, we  have  theCPI  up  3.4  percent  fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter  in  1995  and up  3.7percent  in  1996.  In the  financial markets,  the  strong  stock marketand the strong bond market would seem to  reflect  the notion in  theseus  is  quite sure  is  true,  and that  the  Fed is  about  to  declare  formalvictory, given the  number of  comments by some  members  of  the Committeeabout having raised  interest  rates  high enough.  I think  the  financialbeing euphoric  on  the  top  side.  If  in  fact we get  a rebound in  theeconomy or  any continued pickup  in  inflation,  I think the FederalReserve would have to  tighten  even  further because  of  this  attitude  infinancial markets, and perhaps  in part because  we have contributed tothis  attitude  in those markets.  So  in my view this  is  very clearly  atime  for us  to be  attentive  to  what's  happening  in  the  economy butperhaps  attentive  in  the  sense  of  looking  for  a demonstration of pricestability from the  economy rather  than  looking hopefully for  anindication that we  already have been  successful.  It  seems  to  me  it  istoo  early for  that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley, you have  the  floor.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I would like  to  leaninto  the wind a little here  as  several  have done,  particularly theVice Chairman when he  spoke  just  a moment  ago.  I don't  think  there is3/28/95-33-much question that  the  expansion seems  to  be slowing right  now, and  Icertainly respect  the  strong  logic  in  the  Greenbook about  theexpectation  for  upcoming quarters.  But  I have to  say that  as  of  rightnow, from what  I can see  today,  I am  agnostic about  the  course  of  theupcoming quarters and  the balance of  the  forecast period.  While  I amnot  prepared to bet  very heavily on  it,  I surely would not  overlydiscount  the possibility that we  are going  to  see  a reaccelerationhere  or at  least a considerably  lesser degree of  softening.  I had alist  of  factors here;  almost all  of  them have been mentioned.  Onethat  I would like  to  repeat was mentioned by  the Vice  Chairman aminute  ago.  I have never known whether  the  old saying  that  historynever repeats  itself  is  correct,  or  the  one  that  says  that  those whoignore history are doomed to  repeat  it.  But we  should keep  in mindthat  for the  last  two  years  in a row we  have had a configuration of  afourth quarter  going into  a first  quarter  that looks  very much likethe  one we have  right now.  Certainly, some  things  are a lot  differentright  at  this  point, most  obviously interest  rates,  but we  have hadthis kind of  configuration  for  two years--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think it  is  three years.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Three years?  I'm sorry.  I didn't go  back farenough in my research.  The  economy  is  still  forming new jobs  at  arapid clip--500,000  or  so  in  the  first  two  months.  The relatedearnings will  be kicking into  the  spending stream.  I am not  sure  whathistoric  inventory-to-sales  ratio,  which  leaves a lot  of  room  to  buildinventories.  Factory orders  are  still  strong;  backlogs are  stillrising.  Nominal  rates  all  along  the yield curve  are well  off  theirhighs,  and real  rates  are  certainly down  from where  they were.  Idon't  think we  can call  the  real  rates high  by any reasonable  standardthat  I can  see.  That may  reflect  the slowing  that  we have right now,but  it  also  could set  the  stage  for  some  reacceleration later.  I havebeen anticipating  that  the consumer would run out of  gas  before now,and  that has  clearly been wrong.  Now it  seems  that  the  consumer  isstill  quite  solvent.  With the  stronger  stock market  and bond marketthat we have had recently, I would expect  that  confidence willcontinue  to  stay high.  It  is  still  high, maybe a little off  its  peak,but  nevertheless still  quite strong.  It  will  be  interesting  to  seehow the  lower  dollar plays out.  As  Ted said a few minutes ago,  theband of  uncertainty is  very large.  But a great  many observers  feelthat  the dollar  could easily go  lower over  time  from where  it  is  rightnow,  even if  the decline may be  somewhat  overdone  on  a short-termbasis  in  the  last couple  of months.  It  seems  to me  that  that couldgive  us  an  upside surprise  on  the  export side.  All  in  all,  if  you usethe baseline  forecast  in  the  Greenbook and ask yourself where  therisks  are around  that,  at  the moment  it  would seem  to me  that  they arestill  on  the  up  side,  with  a meaningfully larger  chance  that we willsee  a stronger  economy versus  the  baseline  forecast  than a weakereconomy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  In  December I thought  a slowdownwas  likely,  or  feasible,  and the  evidence is  now becoming  a bit moredefinite that we  are  seeing  that  slowdown.  I think  everybody has beenpretty consistent  in citing housing  and retail  sales--autos  anddurables  in particular--as  the  weakening areas.  I guess  consumers  are3/28/95-34-finally feeling  the stress  of higher  interest rates  as  their ARMs wererepriced and as  they took  on  increased  amounts  of  consumer debt  lastyear.  With wage  increases  flattening out,  taking on  additionalleverage  to  spend is  not  as  advantageous.  Like  several others  aroundthe  table,  I also would like  to argue  that  in  spite  of  the  fact  thatwe  are seeing a slowdown,  I think  it  is  likely  to  be quite mild.Employment  at  fairly  lofty levels  implies  that  aggregate  income willcontinue to  support  consumption.  Also,  we don't  have any verysignificant  balance  sheet strains  at  the household level.On the  business side,  I think the climate  remains  favorablefor  continued investment  at  least  in  the near  term.  We are  carryingforward considerable momentum from  1994.  With  this kind  of  businessinvestment,  we are  going to have  significant  lead  times  on projects,and that  leaves  a fair  amount of  expenditures  in  the  pipeline.  Thecost  of  capital  in  the  aggregate  is  still  relatively low.  Businesscommitments  to  cost  control  and  increased productivity do  implyadditional  capital  expenditures,  although I would admit  that  theimpulse  of  those expenditures  is  mitigated by  the  fact  that we  areseeing  falling computer prices.  Nevertheless,  corporate profits  andcash flows  are  stronger than  expected and this  can support  additionalinvestment.  Balance  sheets are  stronger on  the  corporate  side.Again, this  is  supporting the  opportunity for  increased  investment.It  is  possible  that  the  slowdown will  ease  the  strain  onresource utilization, but  in  any case  I think most people  would agreethat  the  economic  slack currently is  either  significantly diminishedor perhaps  the  economy  is  operating over  capacity.  I continue tobelieve  that  it  is  difficult  to  interpret  these  capacity questions.On the  labor  market  side,  it  could well  be  that we have moreflexibility  than  5.4 percent  unemployment  implies,  and I would citethe  increased use of  temporaries.  I think  the  reengineering processhas  left  people  employed but willing  to  relocate if  betteropportunities  come up.  For various  reasons, perhaps  includingbenefits,  people are  not moving to  seek new employment  in  the samepatterns as  in the  past.  On  the  manufacturing capacity side,  therehave been several  examples  around  the  table  today of  capacity beingadded.  Technology,  I think,  is  making it  very difficult  to  ascertainwhether  our old levels  of capacity are  even as  relevant  anymore.Thus,  with  respect  to  resource utilization, although both product andlabor markets  are  fairly taut,  those  data  are difficult  to  assess.On  the inflation  front,  there  has been considerable progressboth  in  the  numbers  and the psychology, but  we  are  continuing  to  seepressure at  the  commodity and intermediate materials  levels.  We haveforecast  a slight uptick in  the  CPI  for  1995.  But  the  difficulty ofinterpreting capacity and measuring the NAIRU makes  it  difficult  toknow how close we are  to building more  permanent  inflationaryincreases  back into  the  economy.  Perhaps  in the  near  term, we  are  notlikely to  see  too  much erosion of  the progress  that we have  madeagainst  inflation  if  the expansion does  slow a bit and wages  stayunder control.  But  I think it would be  a stretch  to  see much room  forimprovement  on  the  inflation  front under  current  circumstances,particularly when we  take  dollar depreciation  into  account.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor Lindsey.3/28/95-35-

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like my colleague,Governor Kelley,  I am agnostic.  The  difference  is  that  I am a scaredagnostic.  Maybe I have  to  find the  right  church  to  go  to or  somethingto make me  feel  better about  the  future.  I am scared  for  two  reasons.First, with regard to  the  domestic economy,  I think  that  the  Greenbookunderestimates what  I view as  very likely fiscal  contraction laterthis  year.  It  seems  to  me  that  the way  the politics  are  stacking up,we are  going to  have  a contingent  tax  cut  passed.  The contingencywill  be  that we be  on  a steady and sure  path of  deficit  reduction ofabout $25  billion a year  in  order  to  reach balance by 2002.  Now, onecan  fantasize  about how we will  get  to  the  out-year parts  of  that,  butwe  can  easily understand why Congress would be  interested in passingsuch a near-term contingency  in order  to  put dollars  directly  invoters' pocketbooks.  I would imagine  that  beginning in the  fourthquarter of  this year, where we now have what  is  described as  a changein  the  High Employment Budget  of roughly  zero  on  a quarterly basis,  wewould see about  1/2 percent  of  GDP on an  annual  basis,  about  $25billion a year, knocked  off.  I think  that will be  a significant  brakeon the  economy.  The  reason  that  is  a little  frightening  is  that weare  also  in a situation where  the  financial  sector  is  in much moreprecarious  shape around  the  world than  it  is here.  The problems withthe  Japanese banking  industry are well  known  in this  room.  They willhave  to  be  marking  to  market  on Friday, and  that will  be  aninteresting exercise both at  the  Bank of  Japan and at  the privatefinancial  institutions.  I think there will  be some  interestingactivity between now and then.  Similarly, the  German  economy seems  tohave been slowing down.  I think the  pressure on  the  Germans  to dosomething  about the  deutschemark will  become  irresistible.  Hereagain, going back  to  Governor Kelley's  analogy of  history repeatingitself,  this  reminds  me  a lot  of  late  1992  or  early  1993  where  thepossibilities  of  strange  things  happening in currency markets  seemedhigh.Back in  this  country, there  is  one  other ghost  on  the  horizonand that has  to  do with the  debt  ceiling bill  that  will have  to pass,probably in  September  of  this year.  I have been  through two  of  thosewhere  the  government  shuts  down and  I went  home as  a Federal worker--or whatever we do.  I went home  anyway!  [Laughter]  The differencehere  is  that  the  dynamic  is  slightly different.  Previously it  was  afailure of  negotiations where  the  Executive was  trying  to  restrainspending and  Congress was  trying to  increase  it.  That makes  a lot  ofsense.  What we will  have  this  time,  I think, will be Congress  tryingto  restrain spending.  The  default  in  that  situation  really  is  a zerospending game,  and I think  it  is  quite possible  to  have  a protractedperiod, unlike  the  8 or  9 hours or  in  one  case  a 2-day period, whenthe  government  is  shut  down.  The ramifications  of  that  for  theeconomy and  financial markets  could be quite  interesting.  There  is  agood chance we will  avoid it,  but  if  we don't  the  effects  in our bondto  observe.  So,  I am worried about  the  end of  the year.  I think weare  going to  have a general  drag on  the  economy from  fiscal policy.And with  the  Japanese,  the Germans, and our  Congress andAdministration,  the  capacity for  something worse happening certainlyseems  to  be  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  I read mainly  is  that  the varianceis  rising.  I couldn't  quite figure  out  where  the  signs came  out.3/28/95-36-

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That  is  why I am an agnostic.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  The  data  that we  reviewed at  our  last meetingprovided inconclusive  and, as we put  it,  tentative  signs  of  slowing  ingrowth.  The magnitude  of  any moderation in demand growth seemeduncertain and the  timing of  the  long awaited  slowdown was  also  inquestion.  That  certainly raised  the  concern that  it  wasn't going tooccur quickly enough  to avoid  a further  reduction in  labor marketslack, with  future  inflationary consequences.  Since that  meeting, Ithink we have learned  a lot,  although I agree  that not all  doubts havebeen erased.  From my point of  view, the  Greenbook does  an outstandingjob  of digesting  all  the new information.  The  analysis it  presents  isvery well  reasoned.  I would say the  evidence  in hand now points  to  aslowdown that  is  somewhat greater  and more pervasive  than previouslyanticipated.  The  incoming data  coupled, of  course,  with  our recentrate hike have  led to  downward revisions  in  the projected growth  invirtually  every component  of  demand.  I think  the  outlook  for netexports,  at  least  beyond the  current  horizon,  is  the  single modestexception to  that pattern.  From my standpoint, what we  are  finallyseeing  is  the  result of  previous Fed tightening emerging  through thepipeline, with the  interest-sensitive sectors,  housing and autos,leading  the way exactly as  theory and past  experience predict.  On  thedown side,  we  are now seeing a significant  inventory buildup inautomobiles  leading  to production cuts  in  the  spring,  and thatsignificantly weakens  the  forecast  in  the  near term.  Investmentgrowth also  looks  like  it  is  slowing, not  excessively but neverthelessslowing.  So,  at  the moment  the  economy  looks  to  me  like  it  is  not  toohot,  it  is  not  too  cold,  it  is  just  right.The  long-term  inflation risk, it  seems  to me,  is  not  entirelyabsent.  Therefore, we have  to  be  vigilant  to  see how things progressfrom here.  But it  does  seem  to me  that  the risk has  subsided alittle.  We now have a forecast  embodying more  labor market  slack in1995  and  1996  than  our  last Greenbook  forecast,  and a  forecast ofsignificant new capacity coming  on line.  Most  important, of  course,what  we are  seeing is,  to my mind, surprising and continued moderationin  compensation growth  and subdued growth  in  unit  labor  costs.  Ifwages continue  to  be,  as  Ed Boehne put  it,  a nonproblem, that  suggeststhat  eventually we may have  reason  to  question whether  that  the NAIRUis  6 percent  or  .1 or  so  lower.  I think we  should keep  an open mindon  that  topic.The Greenbook emphasizes that  the  dollar poses  significantrisk  to  the  forecast.  I thought  the simulations  in the  Greenbook dida very good job of  assessing  the risk.  I agree with PresidentForrestal  that  the  exchange rate  should not be  a target of  our policy,but  it  does  have appreciable  effects  on output  and inflation.Nevertheless,  it  does  seem to me  that  the  risks  from  the dollar areroughly balanced because, although we  are  told some  interestingstories  about why the dollar  is  doing what  it  is  doing,  I think whenall  is  said and done that  I would agree with Ted's conclusion  that  intruth the  recent movement  in  the dollar  does not  seem  to be warrantedby any perceptible change  in  fundamentals.  On balance, I would saythat  in  a market  like  this where psychology matters  so  much, randomwalks work well.  That  is  probably going  to  be  the best  forecast  ofwhere  things  are headed.  Certainly, the  dollar  could move a lot,  but3/28/95-37-it  could go  either up  or down.  The Greenbook assumption of  a pathwith the dollar  staying where  it  is  seems  appropriate to me,  onbalance.  I take  as  the moral  of  those  simulations  that  what we needto  do  at  this point  is watch  and wait  and be prepared to  adjust policyin either  direction  if  the exchange rate  or  any other risk  factor inthis  forecast  changes  significantly.  On balance,  I see the  risks  tothe  forecast  as being  in  both directions and roughly balanced at  thispoint.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman,  I will  be quite brief.The  scenario sketched in  the Greenbook looks  reasonable  to  me both  inbroad outline and  in most particulars.  A definition of  a reasonableforecast  is  that  there  should be risks  on both  sides,  and they  shouldbe  reasonably close  to balanced.  I think this  one  is,  but  I wouldshade  the risks  slightly higher  on  the down side.  Let me  tell  youwhy.  I could  list  12  upside and  15  downside risks,  but  I'll  list  onlytwo  on  each side  because I said  I would be  brief, and  the  other  13  arealready covered.  [Laughter]  On the  up  side,  I would mention netexport performance being better  than thought, with or without  furtherdepreciation  of  the dollar,  and even more  so  if  there  is  furtherdepreciation  of  the dollar--although on  that  issue  I am  a randomwalker,  exactly as  Govenor Yellen is.  The  second one  I would mention,and  it  has been mentioned several  times,  is  that  this  could indeed bea false negative as we have had several  times.  I can  remember,prominently, developments  last  summer when the  economy  started to  emita little  feel  of  a slowdown.  But  the data  that we have  had in  thelast  two  months,  I think,  are quite different  from the  two months'worth of  data  that we had  last  summer.  It  is  more pervasive.  I thinkit  is much  less  likely  that  this  is  a false  negative than  some  ofthese other episodes  that we have  seen.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't you repeat  that;  I want  to  getall  the  signs right!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  You want  to  get all  the  signs?  I think  it  isless  likely that  this  is  a false negative.  That was  two  negatives;  Ithink  I got  three  in  the  first  go-around.  On  the  down side,  it  seemsmy role  in this  FOMC  meeting  is  to  keep  echoing what  Bob Parry said.I agree very much with Bob's analysis.  As  I look at  the  pieces  of  theGreenbook forecast,  it  is  easier  to  tell  stories component-by-component--consumer spending,  business  fixed investment,  inventories,etc.--coming  in  lower  rather  than higher.  Of  these,  I think I wouldput  inventories  on  the  top  of  the  list.  But  these  are hunches, afterall,  and I have no  major bone  to pick with  the Greenbook on any  ofthose  details.Much more  important  than  that  is  the  fact--and  it  really is  afact--that  forecasts tend  to  understate  swings whenever they occur.It  doesn't matter which direction;  they do  it.  Forecast revisions  areserially correlated;  that  is  a statistical  fact.  There  are  severalreasons  for that.  I think it  has  to  do with underestimation ofmultiplier/accelerator  interactions.  I think  it  also  has  to  do withpeople  always  saying,  "yes there  are  lags,  yes,  there are  lags,"  butnot  really internalizing it  in  their  thinking--at  least  not  in areasonably numerical  way.  And we  all  have  this  tendency to  look  outthe  window and see  how things  are  and generalize  from that.  So3/28/95-38-changes  are  always  underestimated.  To me,  that  is  the major  factorsuggesting there  is  a downside risk.The  other thing I would say, which is  striking to me, is  theconjunction--as  Governor Yellen mentioned--between what  I like  to  callthe  fundamentals  and the  tea  leaves.  The  fundamentals--models, etc.--tell us  that  the monetary tightening  should be just  about  hitting  theeconomy late  in  1994  and into early  1995.  That  is  exactly when westart  seeing  the  slowdown--almost  too good to be  true!  We  have noright  to  think that  these models  are  that  good  on  timing.Nonetheless,  there  are  the  fundamentals,  and there are  the  tea  leavescoming in  right  on  schedule--which gives  me  a lot  more  confidence  thanI would have  in  either one  in  the  absence of  the  other.  At  the  sametime,  I think there are  very few  signs  of  real  deterioration  in  theeconomy.  When  I say a downside risk,  I do  not  mean a recession risk;it  does  not  look  that way at  all.  The data really  say to me  that wehave a chance of  achieving  this  soft  landing.  But  I just  want  toremind  everybody that  the  reason  soft  landings  are  rarely achieved hasto do with what  I was  saying a moment  ago  about  the downside risks.People understate  swings,  forget  about  lags,  and underestimatemultiplier/accelerator models.  That  is  why we  hardly ever achievesoft  landings.In  sum, I can hardly  imagine  circumstances--echoing now bothEd Boehne  and Janet Yellen--that argue more  strongly that  this  is  agood time  to  wait  and see  if  this negative  really is  a true negative,as  I guess  it  is.  At  this point  it  is  only a guess.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let's  move on  to  Don Kohn.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  first  sentence  of mybriefing comes  directly from Governor Blinder's  comments.  I expectedcoffee  in between!  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Don, we  have revisited periodically  theissue of  going back to  some  form  of  credit variable  target  to  replacethe  funds  rate target.  You  sort  of  dismissed that  in your statement.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  A credit variable or  borrowing?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Either.  I use  the  word credit  in ageneric  sense  so  that  it  could be money, it  could be borrowing, itcould be  a credit variable,  it  could be a non-interest-rate variable.Do you  envisage that  sort  of  target  as  even remotely realistic  or  areyou going to  forecast  that we will  be saddled--I  use  the wordadvisedly--with  the  federal  funds rate, which I think everyone wouldagree  is  a less  desirable  target  than something directly related  toour  central  bank operations?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  There are  really two  issues, Mr. Chairman,  and Iwould like  to  subdivide my response accordingly.  One  is  the  issue  ofwhat  Peter Fisher  is  looking at  every day when he  is  adding orsubtracting reserves.  We used  to have  a borrowing objective  that wasreally a proxy for what  was  going on in  the money markets.  It  had alittle more  flexibility  in  it  than direct  funds  targeting.  Now, Peterreally  is  keyed  to  the  funds  rate.  When the  Committee's  target  is  at6 percent he must  react  every time  it  is  at  5-15/16--although that  isnot quite  true.  I think going back  to  targeting borrowing by3/28/95-39-depository  institutions  instead of  the  federal  funds  rate would bevery difficult because  the borrowing  is  very  low, and  the  borrowingfunction  itself  has  shifted around.The other question  that perhaps you are  raising  is  how theCommittee  keys  its decisions  about  changing the  federal  funds  ratetarget that  it  gives  to  Peter.  That  is  where  the  aggregates  used  toplay a role  in  the  sense  that  if  they were  running very high  or verylow relative  to  expectations  or  to  the targets,  they would weigh onthe  scale  on  the  side  of  the  Committee  changing its  instructions  tothe New York Fed.  We have noted in  the  Bluebook  the  last  severaltimes  that M2  demand  seems  to  have become  a little more consistentwith our old models,  although the  whole  level  of  M2  demand has  shifteddown.  With regard  to M2,  even when  it  was  on  model,  it  only gave abroad longer-run perspective on policy.  I think  it would be  much tooearly to  say  that  it  was  going to  stay in  its  old  configuration withinterest  rates  or opportunity costs  and nominal  income.  M2  just  keepschugging along at  1 to 2 percent, and the model now is  predicting  1 to2 percent.  It  may be  that  as  soon  as  the model  predicts somethingelse, M2 will  just  keep chugging along!  I think we  need much moreinformation  that  somehow  the  innovations  in  financial markets--theavailability of  mutual  funds  and what not--have  not  alteredfundamental asset  decisions  by households.On  the  other variables,  there may be  a little  information inthe  credit variables  and even  the broad money aggregates.  Certainly,we  look at  credit  conditions  in  the  sense  of  trying to  see  how willingbanks  and other  lenders  are to  make  loans.  This  ought  to  show up  insome  of  these  flows.  So,  in  terms  of  broad  flows  of  credit  throughthe  economy,  there  might be  something  there  that would provide  alittle  extra  information--in addition to  the  kinds  of  information wealready have  on  spending and nominal  income--that would give  us  alittle  sense  of  what was  going on  in  the financial  markets.  But  Iwould be  very, very skeptical  that we  could ever put  very much weighton those data compared to  the  other more direct measures of  spending.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And certainly not abandon  the  funds  ratetarget--

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  No,  you  couldn't really.  There  is  no  way oftargeting  those broad money  or  credit variables  directly.  It wouldall  be  through  interest  rates  and nominal  income.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well,  we used to.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  only thing we  ever targeted  directly, more  orless,  was M1.  We did move  reserves around to  achieve M1  targets  from1979  to  1982.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  When I  first arrived on  the  scene  inmid-1987,  there were  still  remnants of  different  types  of borrowingtargets.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes,  but  the  borrowing targets  were really proxiesfor  what was  going  on  in reserve markets.  They were not being changedin  direct response  to,  say, M1  or M2.  I think M2  played a role  inchanging  the  borrowing target,  as  indeed we  could see  in  the  1989episode, but  there wasn't  a direct  tie  between the  borrowing and M2.3/28/95-40-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other questions  for  Don?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Don,  in your  discussion of  symmetry andasymmetry, you  indicated that  if  the  Committee were  to  favor asymmetryto  the up  side,  it  might be  as a result  of  its  concern about  the paththat  inflation  is  expected to  take  over  the  longer term.  In  yourdiscussion  of  symmetry, you  talked about  the  Committee maybeconcluding  that  the  risks  are  roughly balanced.  I assume  that  thisprimarily means risks  in  terms  of  economic growth.  What  do you  thinkthe Committee  would be communicating  in  terms  of  its views  aboutinflation if  it  were  to  favor  a symmetric directive?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Obviously, it  would depend  on the  Committee'soutlook  for  inflation.  If  the  Committee were  concerned that  inflationwas  more  likely to  rise  than  to  fall  and it  wanted to  resist  thatrise,  the  asymmetry would tend to  convey that.  If  the Committee  feltthe risks  on  inflation were  evenly balanced around the  3-1/4 percentcore CPI  projected  in the  Greenbook but  did not  like  that  outcome,then  it  seems  to me  the  Committee  also would want  to  tilt  a little bittoward  the  tight  side.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Don,  in  your discussion  about  inertia and whatmight  or might not work, you did not  mention the  monetary base.  Isthat  principally because  of  the  currency component, especially  thecurrency held abroad, or do  you have  something else  in mind?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  No.  I think  first  of  all  that  the growth offoreign holdings  of  our currency has  distorted growth  of  the basesubstantially.  We  have only  the  roughest notion  of what  proportion ofour  currency is  held overseas  and how it  changes  month to  month.  Wehave a lot  of work going on here  at  the Board  trying to  estimate that,and people  are  refining their  estimates  using all  sorts  ofsophisticated econometric  techniques--comparing seasonals  and thingslike  that.  But  in the  end, we  are still  only part way toward knowingwhat  those holdings  are.The other point  I would make  is  that  even ignoring thecurrency part,  the  reserves part  of  the  base  tracks Ml;  that  is  whatit  is.  The velocity of M1  is  extremely variable as  we  have  seen.  TheCommittee  itself  abandoned M1  targeting back in  the  early  1980sbecause M1  became very interest  elastic  once NOW  accounts wereintroduced and depositors began shifting  funds  between NOW accountsand time  deposits.  That  sort  of  thing  also  shows  through  to  the  base.So,  I would not put  a lot  of  weight  on movements  in  the  base.  For  theSt.  Louis  conference  on operating procedures  a couple  of  years agothat Al  Broaddus was  involved with, we  cranked McCallum's  rule  for  thebase  through  the MPS model.  We  found a distinct tendency  forinstrument  instability.  McCallum has  his  base  rule being  adaptive tochanges  in velocity, but  even with the adaptation, we had huge  swingsin  interest  rates  and no  clear  gain over  looking at nominal  income  orother variables directly.  We do  have  some work continuing  on  this  andhopefully we  can circulate  it  to  the  Committee pretty  soon.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Don, am  I right  in thinking thatone  of  the messages  from your very interesting presentation  is  that werates would be appropriate again?  When we were going  through thetightening exercise, we went  25,  25,  25,  then a couple of  50s,  then75,  then  50.  If  we are  as  balanced as  you say we  are,  and based onyour presentation, would you not  feel  that  25  basis point moves  arequite  appropriate now?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think  they would be  more  appropriate now,particularly  if  in order  to make  50 basis point moves,  the  Committeefelt  it  had  to  wait for more  information.  I thought  the  lesson of  mysermon was  that  it  is  better  to  be a little  flexible,  and maybe  evenhave to  reverse  after going in  one  direction  or another,  than  to getstuck  on a particular rate  that gets  harder  to  change  the longer  theCommittee  is  stuck on  it.  One  can  see a little of  this  in Germany  andJapan right  now, I think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Don,  do you also  think that  25  basis pointchanges  could be implemented, as  they were  in  the  beginning, decoupledfrom the  discount rate?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Sure,  but  they  would be  announced.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  In  fact,  I saw a comment  recently that  suggestedit  might be wise,  if  the  Fed is  going to  tighten, to  do  it  with  thefunds  rate  rather than  the  discount rate.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think  it  was  in one  of  the  incoming Reserve Bankletters  on  the discount  rate.  That  would allow the  spread to  widenand make  it  easier  to  reverse, because  if  the  Committee  started  toreverse in  tentative  steps,  the  discount rate  would not  have  to becut.  Now that  both discount rate  changes  and  funds  rate  changes  areannounced, the difference  between them has  certainly narrowed.  Andsince  the  Committee  is  going to  announce any funds  rate change,  itwould need to  decide whether  there  is  to be  any distinction in  thetype  of  announcement  it  would make between a plain  open marketoperations  change and  such  a change accompanied by a discount ratechange.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I have a lot  of  sympathy with what you aresaying, Don, about  the  need to  move  the  funds  rate more flexibly.  Itgives me  an opportunity to  underline  a point  I have made before.  Ifwe  just  had some kind of  clear long-term  anchor, it  would be  a loteasier  to  do  that.  Certainly, one  of  the  reasons we  are reluctant  todo  that  and one  of  the  reasons  the  press  focuses on  it  so much  is  thatthat  is  really  the  indicator  that  they  can key on  to  see whether  ornot we  are  still  moving in  the  long-term direction we  say we aremoving  in.  If  we  could solve  the  longer-term question, I think  itwould feed  right  into  this  kind of  operating  issue.3/28/95-42-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  from anybody?  If  not,let me  get  started.It  is  pretty  obvious  that  the  growth of  the  economy  is  movingdown  in  the  direction that we had hoped.  Indeed,  if  the  evidence didnot  show that,  as  I indicated at  our  last meeting, I think we would befacing severe difficulties at  this  stage with  serious  instabilitybeginning to  emerge.  The  extent  of  the  weakness clearly  is  notpervasive;  it  is  still  relatively spotty.  We  see  it,  for  example, inthe  interest-sensitive  areas,  as many of you have  indicated.  Thelonger-term buttress  to  the  system clearly has not  been undermined.The recent  gains  in backlogs  of  orders,  for  example,  remain verysolid.  One  of  the reasons  is  that  a gap has  opened up between  ordersand shipments  so  that  even when orders  fluctuate  a little,  the  gap  isstill  there;  the  second difference of  the change  in unfilled orders  isreally not  discernible on  any particular charts.  We  are,  however,seeing  initial claims  beginning to  edge modestly higher.  And I don'tknow whether  it  means  anything, but C&I  loans  have  flattened out  inthe  last  two weeks after  spiking up  for  a considerable period.The  question has been raised as  to  whether  there  has been achange  in  the  seasonals  that  explains why we  are  seeing weaker  firstquarters relative  to  fourth quarters  than we used to  see.  I thinkthis  is  a very questionable proposition in  large part because  it  istough  to  find  a change  in  temperature  degree-days nationwide.  It  isespecially difficult, at  least  as  best  I can  judge,  to  see a patternin  the  southern areas  of  the United  States--where  one would presumethat  seasonality would be  less  of  a factor--that  differs  from thatnationwide.  We still  get  a big surge  in  the  fourth quarter  andweakness in  the  first  in  that part of  the country.  Nonetheless,  thereare reasons  to  suspect  that weaker growth may in  fact be  emerging  thisyear, not  because  of  seasonality but  largely because of  the operationof  the  business cycle.Gary Stern has raised  an interesting  question with respect  toinventories.  It  has  always been the  case  that when business peoplecomment  that  "my sales have  not done  as  well as  I expected,"  that  isalgebraically equivalent to  "my inventories  are higher than  Iplanned."  The  question is  how important  is  that  development.  I thinkit  is  important  enough to  raise  the  possibility that  the  secondquarter  is  going  to  be slower  than the  consensus  expectation.  TheGreenbook may be  on  track here.  We  probably have a mini  inventoryrecession under way, though not  one  that  I would consider  to be  anyparticular  cause for  concern.  As  I indicated at  our  last  meeting, Idon't  think any measures of  inventory levels  are pointing to  a largeprospective overhang.  Indeed, the  inventory data have  been reviseddown.  I don't mean necessarily for  the  fourth quarter, but as  Irecall the  annual revision for  trade has actually brought  the numbersdown so  that we  are  dealing with an inventory level  situation that  isvery far  from scary.  Nonetheless, we  do  have  a short-term inventorycycle  tending to  emerge.  As  a consequence  of  this,  I think we arelooking  at  the possibility that  there  is  an  element  of  euphoria abouta soft  landing  that probably mitigates  against  it  happening for  thereasons  that  the  Vice Chairman and a number of  others have indicated.I think  the downside  risks  are basically coming  from thepossibility of  significant  increases  in stock and bond prices.  If  youremember,  some  of  our discussions  about  the necessity  of moving  in3/28/95-43-early 1994  recognized  that we were beginning  to get wealth effectsthat  were unsustainable  and potentially creating bubbles.  Ironically,the  real danger  is  that  things  may get  too good.  When  things  get  toogood, human beings  behave awfully.  I would be a little cautious  aboutwhat  stance we  take.  In retrospect,  I would change  that sentence  inmy Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony where I stated hypothetically that  wemight be  easing rates.  The reason  I would change  it  at  this  stage  isnot  that  I think the  statement  is  incorrect.  It  is  a correctstatement  of  policy, but  I underestimated the  degree  of credibilitythat  the  Federal  Reserve has accumulated  in the  last year  or  so.  As  aresult  of  this,  as  the  Vice  Chairman observed, the markets  trulybelieve  that we know what  is  going on  in  the  economy to  a degree  thatno  one  else  really does.  Therefore, we got  the  largest swing  in2-year to  10-year maturities  that  I can recall  in  a long  time.  Thatswing was basically the  result  of  the disappearance  from  the marketsof  an expectation of  significant  further  tightening.  The  argument wasnot  that  the  Federal  Reserve  is wrong  and we are  going to  have  totighten.  Their money was  on  the  fact  that we were  right and we  wouldnot  have  to  tighten.  Now, I worry  about  that,  and I worry about thatbasically because we  could be  our own worst  enemies  in this  regard.I think  that  this  raises  an interesting question of policy,not  about our  fundamental  policy but  rather  the  symmetry/asymmetryissue about which I have mixed views.  Let me  tell you what  I think isthe  relevant  issue here.  I think there  is  no  alternative  to  "B" asthe  fundamental  choice.  In an  odd way, if  it  were not  for  thiscredibility/noncredibility issue and  the  extent  to which we  areaffecting markets  and therefore having wealth effects  in the  economy,I would say this  is  a classic  case  of  symmetry.  It  is very difficultlooking  at  current  conditions  to  see  anything other  than  a balancedsituation.  I think, however,  that  the  symmetry/asymmetry question  isreally more appropriately a loss  function issue.  In  other words,  itdoes  not  involve our best  guess as  to what  we think  the  appropriatepolicy is,  but  rather what  the  consequences are of  our  taking aposition on  this matter, recognizing that  it  will be made public  eightweeks  from now.  My concern is  that  after the mini  inventory recessionunfolds and what  is  still  a relatively strong capital  goods marketstarts  to  create  incomes  and consumption, we may find that we wish wehad been somewhat  tighter  somewhere along  the  line.  A change in  ourrhetoric  including  the  use  of  asymmetry may be  the  desirable  thing  todo.  I definitely do  think we  ought  to change  our  rhetoric.  I have noreally strong feelings  on whether we  should be  symmetric  orasymmetric, and very honestly, I could go  either way.  My own marginalpreference is  to  go  asymmetric,  but  I would  find  it perfectlyacceptable to  use  a symmetric  directive  here.  One  thing that  concernsme about  what  I just  said  is  that  it  is  almost  too  cute.  It  is  takingfine-tuning  to  the point  of  sharp pointedness  that  may be  overdone.But  I must  say  that  I line  up with  the  concerns  that  the ViceChairman, Governor Kelley,  and a few others  have mentioned.  I wouldbe  inclined in  that direction, but  I am  interested in  getting everyoneelse's view on  this  issue and call  on  the  Vice Chairman first.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I findmyself  in  the  awkward position of  advocating  asymmetry as  a signalingdevice,  having  spoken against  the  use  of  asymmetry for  that purpose  anumber  of  times  in the  past.  But at  this particular  time--althoughthere  is no  question in my mind  that  "B" is  correct,  i.e.,  that  weshould not  change interest  rates  at  this meeting--to the degree  we3/28/95-44-believe  that our primary responsibility is  price  stability, I thinkthe  inflation  forecast  that most  of  us  have discussed  is  such  that weshould be on  record  the Friday after the  next meeting as  havingindicated a concern about  the  trend in prices  even  though  the use ofour directive  for  that purpose  is  a somewhat puny weapon.  I think thefact  that  those  minutes would indicate  that  the Committee had decidedto  maintain interest  rates but  had decided on  an asymmetric directivetoward  tightening would have  a reasonable amount  of merit  in  enhancingour position  as understanding  our responsibility for price  stability.Therefore, while it  is  hard for me  to  throw my Celtic  enthusiasm  fullyinto  the  ring  for  something  that  I usually think  is  not terriblyimportant, I do  feel rather  strongly that  an  asymmetric directive ispreferable.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I thought  Don Kohn'sremarks were very useful  concerning the  problems we are  going  to  befacing  in making policy decisions.  I also  found very useful  yourremark right  now on  the  interplay with the  marketplace and the  need tochange  the  rhetoric.  I don't  know how it  can be  changed in  a positiveway.  We  almost need a heuristic  model  for  the markets  as well  as  aneconometric model to  figure  out what  is  going  on.  The  sort  of  thingsthat you point to,  these  ideas  about  how we  are  seen as  having somesort  of  knowledge  that  others  don't have, has  led me  to  the  conclusionthat  at  least  for  the  time being  it  is  impossible to  say anything thatis  going  to  be interpreted the  way we want  it  to  be  interpreted.If  I thought  that  the  New York Fed forecast  that  BillMcDonough presented was  correct  about  inflation  in  1996--if  I could beconvinced of  that  and I hope he is  wrong  on  that  forecast--I  would saythat we  ought  to  tighten policy now because  inflation  is  definitelygoing in  the wrong direction.  I would agree with Governor Kelley thatthe risks  in  the  forecast are more likely  to be  in  the direction ofmore  inflation  rather  than  less.  What  I don't know how to  assess,though,  is  an  inventory forecast  that  is  the  inevitable mirror  imageof  last year's  inventory cycle.  What we  really are talking  about  hereis  that we  are expecting  sometime within  1995  to  have  inventoryeffects  that  are  the  opposite  of  those  that we  saw in  1994.  We won'tknow and neither will  the  auto  manufacturers nor all  of  these  otherpeople  such  as  retailers  know as  things unfold whether  it  is  themirror  image  of  last  year or  whether  it  is  more of  a cyclicaldevelopment.I guess  I am not  far  away  from the  use  of  monetaryaggregates.  My  own judgment is,  as  Don  Kohn's  remarks might  suggest,that  in principle excess demand  for  and excess  supply  of moneybalances can be  translated into  excess demand  for and excess  supply  ofoutput.  The problem is,  given the  imprecision  of  the  econometricmodels  and all  of  that,  that  it  requires  a lot  of  judgment.  We  allhave  different  judgments,  so we may come  to  different  conclusions.But what makes  the  current  environment different  for me  is  that wehave had a prolonged period of  very slow growth in  the variousmonetary aggregates.  We  saw  the narrow money measure  not grow at  alllast year  even though  commercial  loan  demand was  extremely strong andone would presume  that  compensating balances  increased a lot.  Leavingout  the  growth of  currency mainly  for  foreign usage  and makingjudgmental  allowances  for what might have happened to  compensating3/28/95-45-balances  on  the  corporate side,  we have  had very weak money growth  andthe  Greenbook/Bluebook projections  for  1995  imply  to me  that  we aregoing  to  have a further  absolute decline  in desired money balances onthe  order  of  5 or  6 percent  or  something  like  that.I look at  that and say  that my main  concern now is  not  thatthere will  be  too much growth of  output.  I really never worry verymuch about output and employment growing too  fast,  but  rather  aboutthe  growth of  output and employment slowing too  fast  relative to  thegrowth  of demand.  I come back to  the issue  of what  is  going to  happento  spending in  the  economy, the  demand problem, whether  it  is  forcurrent  consumption purposes or  for  adding  to  capacity or  improvingproductivity.  As  long  as  we can  see  that whatever  framework we usetells  us  that we  are getting a deceleration  in  the growth  of  demand, Ithink we probably are going  to  come  out okay.  So,  at  this point,  Icertainly would not be  in  favor of  the  "A" alternative.  I think thatit  is  premature  to  think about  that  alternative.  I am notuncomfortable  with no change,  but  because of perceptions  on theoutside  I think  that  the bias  in  the  directive  has  to  be  that,  if  orwhen we  act,  it  is  more  likely  to  be to  tighten  than  to  ease.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  in  evaluating the  current policy stance,as  I think you all  know,  I tend to  look  at  reserve measures  andmonetary aggregates.  I think the  current policy  stance has  a chanceof  capping  the  recent  rise  in  inflation, albeit probably at  a somewhathigher  level  than  we are  seeing right  now.  The  decline  in  long-termbond yields gives me  some  confidence  that we  can  afford  to  wait  andwatch  for a while.  As you notice,  I said  "chance."  I am notconvinced;  I would  count myself  among the  agnostics.  Certainly,looking  longer term, I am not at  all  sure  that we have  done enough  toreduce  the  trend rate  of  inflation, and I clearly feel  that  this  3 to4 percent  inflation range  that we  may be  able  to  settle  for here  ismuch too  high.With respect  to  the outlook  for  the  economy, I personallywould not  put too much stock  in the  forecast  of  an  imminent  rapidslowdown.  I think  that we  could well  be surprised by the underlyingstrength.  I would  associate myself with what  Bill  McDonough saidbefore  in  that  it  seems  to  me  that  financial market  participants  haveall  rushed to  one  side  of  the  boat here,  and  I don't know to  whatextent  comments by Fed officials have  led  to  that.  My feeling  is  thatthere  is  much more  to  their  assessment than  just  Fed  statements  thathave been made.  In  any event,  it  seems  they  have all  rushed  to  oneside  of  the boat.  I think our  focus  in this  Committee  ought  to  be  onlong-term price stability, not  short-run  fine-tuning  of  the  realeconomy.  That  is  really what we  ought  to be  thinking about--whetherwe  are on a course  that  is  really going to  achieve price  stability.The other  thing  I would say,  and there has been surprisinglylittle mention of  it  today at  least  in  the  context  of  the  policydiscussions,  is  that we  have to  continue  to  recognize  the  constraintsput  on policy by the weak dollar  in  foreign exchange markets.  To  theextent  that market participants perceive  that  our actions  are notconsistent with long-term price stability, then we are  courting thepossibility of,  I think, very severe  financial  repercussions.  I have3/28/95-46-never believed that we ought  to  use policy to  try  to  target a specificexchange rate  for  the  dollar, but  I do  think we have  to  recognize attimes  like  this  that  it  can be a very significant  constraint not onlyon  what we  say but particularly on what we do.  As  I say,  I think ourfocus  ought  to  be  on long-term price  stability.With respect  to  the  symmetry/asymmetry question,  I don't haveany strong views  about  that.  If  the message  were  that  this  isasymmetric toward  tightening because we  think it  is  more likely we  aregoing to  have  to  tighten more to  achieve  long-term price  stability, Iwould clearly favor  that.  I could accept  a symmetrical  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Unlike,  I think, many  of  the  other people whohave  spoken already, I did not  come  to  this meeting with apredisposition in  favor  of  staying pat.  Rather, most  of  the work wehave done,  and most  of  the people I have  talked to,  suggested thatfurther  interest rate  increases  were  necessary to  keep  inflation  incheck and deal  with  the  kind  of capacity constraints, particularly onthe  labor market  side,  that  are being forecast  both by us  and byprivate  sector  forecasters.  My own  bias would be to  tighten  soonerrather  than  later because  I think that  ends  up making  for a bettersituation  overall.  Increasing interest  rates  at  this  time  does  notseem  to  be the main  thrust  of  the  argument here.  I can certainly buyinto  the  argument  that  it  doesn't matter whether we do  it  at  thismeeting, or at  another meeting, or  in between.  My own preference,however, would be  to  indicate  that  the Committee  would be  moreinclined to  increase  interest  rates  in the  future  rather  than  to  leavethem pat,  or possibly decrease them, because  I think that  the  trendsin inflation  over  the  longer run are  not what  I would prefer.With that  in mind, when we  discussed our stance  towardannouncing decisions  after meetings, we  did discuss  the possibilitythat when  there was  no change, we might want  to  communicate more thanthat we  just  left  the room.  That  is  a possibility that  does notrequire us  to wait  eight weeks,  although it  does  run  the risk of  whatPresident  Jordan  referred to  as  the  impossibility of  saying anythingright.  But  it  is  at  least  a possibility that we  could mentionsomething  in our  discussion of  this  meeting that was  a little moreexplanatory or  a little  bit more on  the side  of  being concerned aboutthe upside potential  for  inflation in whatever we release  after  thismeeting.  After saying all  that,  I guess  it  should come  as  no  surprisethat  I would be  in  favor of  an  asymmetric directive.  I really dothink that  there  is more  room  to move  interest  rates up before we  stopdoing so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I think Don Kohn raised a couple  of  interestingpoints,  and I would like  to  start with comments on  those.  I do  thinkthis  problem of  interest  rate  inertia is  a real  problem, potentiallyat  least.  It  may be  that what  we are  seeing  in  the  financial marketsnow is  a consequence  of unsustainable  euphoria for one  reason oranother.  But  it  may be  on  the other hand that  the markets  are  tellingus  something  significant.  I don't have  a judgment  about that,  and Ibelieve we  should be careful  about rushing  to  a conclusion about  that.While  it  is  not  fully convincing, it  is  worth noting that  some work3/28/95-47-that  we have done  suggests  that  the  monetary base might be  a usefulindicator  or  maybe some  sort of useful  intermediate  target,  evenrecognizing  the problems with the  currency component.  I think that  isworth pursuing down  the  road.With regard to  the  immediate  situation, I certainly favoralternative B.  I don't  feel  all  that  strongly about  the question ofsymmetry versus  asymmetry, but  I come out  on the  side  of  favoringsymmetry.  Part  of  that  is  my usual  reluctance  to go  to  an asymmetricdirective.  In  these circumstances,  as  I suggested already, we don'tknow a lot  about what  the markets  are  telling us  about recent  interestrate movements,  at  least  I don't.  But  it  is  also  true  that  the periodbetween now and the next meeting is  relatively long, and we  are goingto get  a lot  of  incoming  information.  We  don't meet  again untilfairly late  in May if  I have  the  calendar right.  I don't  have  afeeling as  to what  the  incoming  information may tell  us,  and I wouldlike  to  be  in a position of  simply judging  it  as  it  comes  in.  Beyondthat,  and maybe  I am just being a little too  cynical here,  I amcertainly not  pleased by  the performance of  the dollar, but  I don'tthink we ought  to  put ourselves  in a position where we might want  toreact  to  that.  I am not  persuaded that  that would be  appropriate  atthis  juncture or  that  it  is  something we  can  do very successfully.So,  I would be reluctant  to  go  to  asymmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, because  I find the  path forinflation  in  the  baseline forecast  unacceptable, my  first preferencewould be  for  a small  increase  in  rates.  However, I could supportalternative  B because  of  the  significant  uncertainties  that we  see  inthe very short-term prospects  for  the economy.  I also would stronglyfavor asymmetry toward tightening,  given the  expected unsatisfactorypath for  inflation  for  the  next several  years  if  the baseline policyassumptions  are  accepted.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman,  as  I look  at  the  situation, Ithink  that  the economy is  in relatively good shape.  Some might  takethe  position that  the  dollar would argue against  that,  but generallyspeaking the  economy looks  good  to me.  We are  getting some  of  thethink policy has  been very, very successful.  It  is  true  that  thisgoing  to be permanent  or not.  Under  these  circumstances  there  is  noquestion at  all  in my mind that  alternative  B is  the  right  alternativeto have  at  this  time.  With respect  to  symmetry or  asymmetry, I don'tfeel  very strongly about  it.  I do  think that  the risks  are  fairlywell balanced, and  so  I would have  some preference  for  symmetry.  Ialso wonder what we gain by going to an  asymmetric directive at  thistime because  if  the  expansion does  not slow down  sufficiently betweennow and May 23,  we will probably make  the next move  then, be  it  25  or50  basis points.  The  minutes  for  this meeting come  out shortly afterthat meeting,  so I don't  really know what  difference  that makes.  Forthose reasons,  I would support  a symmetric  directive.  But  if  I had avote,  I certainly would not vote  against an asymmetric directive.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, given  the data  coming  in,  I canwait  as  you are suggesting.  But as  I said earlier,  I am concernedabout  the upside  risks  especially for  inflation, and  I am concernedabout  the  inertia Don was  talking  about  that  can take place.  Withthat,  I would very strongly support  asymmetry  toward  tightening andwould encourage us  to  move  sooner rather  than  later.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I favor no  change  in  the  federalfunds rate  today.  However,  I do  think that  the risks  are more  on  theup  side  than balanced at  this point.  In  fact,  our  forecast  forinflation  for 1995  is  closer to  3-1/2  percent  than to  the  3.2  percentin  the  Greenbook.  It  is  appropriate  to  wait  for more  information onthe  economy in  the  coming weeks,  but  I think we  clearly  should remainopen  to  further  increases.  It  comes  as  no  surprise that  I favor  theasymmetric directive  as well,  not  only  for  the  reasons  that you gave,Mr. Chairman, but I think two  of  the points  that  Don Kohn made werevery well-taken.  He  said that  if we  were not  happy with  the  3.2percent  inflation  rate that  is  forecast  in  the  Greenbook, that wouldbe one  argument  for an asymmetric  directive or  if  we  thought  the  riskswere higher  on  the up  side rather  than balanced,  that would be  anotherreason.  I agree with both.  So,  clearly,  I favor  an asymmetricdirective.

MR. BOEHNE.  I support  alternative  B because  this  is  a wait-and-see  time,  and I support  an  asymmetric directive for  the reasonsthat were well  articulated by  Bill McDonough.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman,  in  considering  an asymmetricdirective, I am reminded of  the  spring of  1993.  I have been here  solong  that  I am starting to  look backward!  In  the  spring of  1993,  thefear of  a bubble was  mentioned at  this  table.  We  actually had apretty good bubble  develop  in  the bond market,  and we paid a fairlysignificant  price  for  it  in financial  market  instability later.  Asyou noted,  that bubble  gave an  extra impetus  to  demand  in  late  1993and early 1994.  What  we did,  though, was  to  go  asymmetric and thenback off.  I have  to  conclude  that doing  that,  if  anything, cementedthe  market's view that we were  stuck  at  a particular rate.  It  onlybuilt  the market's  confidence that  they could borrow at  3 percent  andlend at  6 percent, which  is  literally what  they were doing.  I'll  behappy to  vote  for whatever  the  Committee majority  favors.  But  if  whatwe  fear  is  a bubble, we  should not  in my view go  asymmetric  unless wereally expect to  raise  rates.  If people  do want  to raise  rates  andwant  to  send a signal  that we might be  doing so,  I think a fewdissents would be a much more  appropriate way of  sending  that  signal.Given what we did  in  1993,  going asymmetric and then backing off,  I amafraid we would only strengthen  the  conviction of  the  market and maybeactually exacerbate the  bubble.  So  I favor  symmetric.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Mr. Chairman,  I think your strongrecommendation for  alternative  B, the  fact  that  it  is  a crystal  clear3/28/95-49-are all  correct.  I am happy to  endorse  them.  On theasymmetry/symmetry issue,  I am certain  that I am not  certain[Laughter]  for  the  following  reason.  Before  I was a member of  theFederal  Open Market  Committee,  I thought I knew what  the differencebetween a symmetric  and an  asymmetric  directive  was.  The  longer  Iserve--and today certainly has  added to  this  immensely--the less  Iknow about what  this  distinction means.  So,  I actually would like  torequest, before we vote  on  this,  a specification  of what we  are votingon.  Let me  elaborate  on  that  slightly.  If  Bill  McDonough and severalof  the  others  are correct  in  the sense  that  inflation  is  likely  to behigher  in  1997  than  in 1994--and I think he probably is  correct  inthat--and  if we  are adamantly opposed to  that,  this  Committee  shouldnot  be  voting an  asymmetric directive.  We  should be raising interestrates, probably by  100  basis points  today.  I do  not  advocate thatpolicy, but  I think that  is  the  implication.  That  is  not  somethingthat  leads  to  an asymmetric directive.  At  the  end of  this,  I am goingto  pose  the  question:  What  do  we mean by an asymmetric  directive?On  the  signaling issue,  I find  that quite baffling.  As  Ithink Bob Forrestal  just  said, on May 23  we  either will  raise interestrates  or we will  do nothing.  That  will be major news.  Three dayslater,  the  kind of  directive we  adopted on March 28  will  be announcedand nobody will  notice  it.  So,  I don't  see  that  this  has  anysignaling value  as  long  as  it  is  not  leaked, and  I certainly hope  thatit  will not be  leaked.  Therefore,  I raise  the  question of  whatsymmetry vs.  asymmetry means.  I thought  a symmetric  directive meant  afairly strong conviction at  this meeting  that we would not  be changinginterest  rates  one way or  the  other until  the next  meeting--leaving,of  course,  the  usual  flexibility that  something  quite unusual  couldhappen and we  could change  our minds.  So  it  is  not  a lock-in, but  itis  a predisposition of  the Committee  to  hold today's  decision untilthe  next meeting.  If  I am right  about  that,  and at  this point  I amnot  sure  that  I am,  I would strongly favor  a symmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I look at  it  as  a question ofprobabilities.  In  other words,  the question really amounts  to:  Whatis  the probability in  this  long period that we will be moving rates  upor  moving them down?  I would say that we are more  likely to  move  themup, finding,  for  example,  that  the  slowdowns we  are  seeing  arepartially false  or  reversed as  has  happened many times  in  the  past.  Ifind the probability  that  this  slowing will  cumulate into  asignificantly weak  economy that  would induce  us  to move rates  down  isvery low.  I think the  major probability is  that we will  do  nothing.Since  I think the  likelihood of moving  them higher  is  sufficientlygreater  than moving  them lower,  I lean marginally,  tentatively,unsurely toward asymmetry, which is  really a reflection of  the  factthat  I think  the major probability is  that we will  do  nothing.  I readasymmetry not  as  an  overwhelming probability that we will move, butmerely  a probability  that  one can basically identify.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  If  I can clarify that:  You are  suggesting thatthere  are  three probabilities.  The middle  probability is  doingnothing.  If  the up  probability exceeds  the  down probability--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  By a sufficient amount.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Okay, I have  it.  Thank you.3/28/95-50-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And each of  us  has  to  determine whatconstitutes  a sufficient  amount.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Okay, thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly  think there is  everyreason  to  "wait and see"  today.  I strongly  support  "B."  I did  speakearlier about  my feeling that  as  of  now the risks  could be  seen asskewed  to  the  up side.  My understanding of  the  use of  an asymmetricor  symmetric  directive  is  exactly the  same as  you just  articulated,Mr. Chairman.  On  that basis,  it  would seem to me  that  the  likelihoodof needing to  go up  further  is  strong  enough  that  I would prefer anasymmetric directive.  However,  let me  say that  I think that  theemergence of  that  upside potential,  if  it  does  develop, may well  be ameeting or  two out  in  front  of us.  So  we may really want  to wait  andsee  today in  the  sense of  adopting not only  "B" but  also a symmetricdirective.  I could support  that,  although  I would prefer  asymmetric.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Let me  first  if  I may, Mr. Chairman,  associatemyself with Gary Stern's  comments about  the  monetary base.  I thinkthere  is  a lot  to be  gained by  some  additional research  looking at  thepossibility of  using the  base  or perhaps  something similar  to  it  inour  operating procedures.As  far as  policy is  concerned, I can  certainly accept  notchanging  the  rate  today, but  I have a relatively  strong preference  forasymmetry.  As  I said  in my earlier  statement, and I agree with a lotof  folks  here,  I think that while  the risks  in  the  outlook  are morebalanced than  they were  earlier, they still  are not  fully balanced.  Ibelieve  there  continues  to  be  a significant  upside  risk,  so  I think asa substantive matter asymmetry is  a better  statement.  Also,  I thinkGovernor Blinder  is  right  that  the significance  of  our  statement  onsymmetry as  a signal  can easily  be over  emphasized;  I don't  think itis  zero.  We  have already gotten some  relatively high numbers  on  thecore  CPI,  for  example,  in the  first  couple  of months  of  this  year.  Ifthat  continues,  even if  we were  to move  and certainly if we were notto move and  let's  say we were  on the  fence  again at  the next  meeting,asymmetry would just be  one additional piece  of  evidence  as  to  thedirection of  our  longer-term strategy and efforts.  I don't  think  thesignal value  is  zero,  and I think that  is  another  reason for  goingasymmetric.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I agree with your  recommendation for no  changein  the  federal  funds  rate.  I agree with your recommendation for  anasymmetric  directive, although  I normally prefer  symmetry, not  only  tosignal  our  leaning  in  regard  to  inflation  fighting but  also  in regardto  the  dollar.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Given  the  evidence on  the  slowdown,  I agreethat  "B" is  an appropriate directive--no  change.  I do  think  that  it3/28/95-51-is possible  that additional  tightening  is  going to  be  needed  if  we aregoing to  resume progress on  reducing inflation.  I have  a slightpreference  for  asymmetry  toward tightening because  I do  think thatthere  is  some  signaling value.  But  I would not vote  against  symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  I agree with your proposal  for  alternative B forno  change today.  Although I could  live with asymmetric,  I wouldprefer  symmetric  for  the  reasons  that  have been explained by  PresidentForrestal  and Governor Blinder.  At  the  moment,  it  seems  to me  thatthe  economy, with  some reasonable  probability, is  on  track  for  a softlanding.  There  are all  kinds  of uncertainties  in  the  outlook.Indeed, we may have  a false  negative;  we may be  learning that.  Thereremains  a risk  that  inflation may not  come  down  in  the way we wouldlike.  I certainly hold open the possibility that at  some  future pointwe may need to raise  rates more.  But  over this  next  intermeetingperiod, when  I think about what  data are  likely to  come  in,  it  seemsto  me  that  the  risks  are  balanced and that  tends  to  call  for  symmetry.Certainly, I agree with what Don  said.  We  should not  get  stuck wherewe  are.  I have no  objection whatsoever  to  intermeeting changes.  Theapproach of possibly smaller  changes,  25  basis  points  one  way oranother,  has  a great  deal  of  appeal  at  this  stage.  It  is  simply  thatat  this  point,  for  the  next  month and a half,  it  seems  to me  that  therisks  and likely information  indicate  risks  in both  directions andthat  that  calls  for  symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think as  I read the  view of  thisCommittee, we would be  at  alternative B and mildly asymmetric.  Wouldyou read the  directive?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The  directive would read, and this  is  on page14  of  the Bluebook:  "In the  implementation of  policy  for  theimmediate  future,  the  Committee  seeks  to maintain the  existing degreeof pressure on  reserve positions.  In  the context  of  the  Committee'slong-run objectives  for  price stability  and  sustainable  economicgrowth, and giving careful  consideration  to  economic,  financial,  andmonetary developments,  somewhat  greater  reserve  restraint would  orslightly lesser reserve  restraint  might be  acceptable in  theintermeeting period.  The  contemplated reserve conditions  are  expectedto be  consistent with moderate  growth  in M2  and M3  over  comingmonths."

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Before  we adjourn, Ted Truman  has  a veryminor change  to  recommend  in the  minutes  for  our previous meeting.Ted, did you want  to  read it  or  shall  I read  it  from here?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I apologize because  I thought  I had read theminutes  earlier,  but  I had not.  Out  thinking at  the  time  of  the  lastmeeting was  that  the Japanese earthquake would affect our  imports  butnot  our exports.  The  truth  of  the  matter at  this point  is  that  wethink the  earthquake will  affect neither.  But  that was where we were,so  I would prefer  to take  out  the  phrase in  paragraph 14  that  says  itwill  affect our  exports.  That  shortens  the sentence  to  the  one  factthat we  know pretty certainly--that  the Mexican situation will  affectour exports.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  [Laughter]  May 23is  our next meeting and we  adjourn for  lunch.
