CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We can come to order and approve the

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  With a motion and a second we will 

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  [Statement--see Appendix.]  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any comments or questions?  

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  I'd just like to ask this:  You mentioned that   minutes.        approve the minutes, if there are no objections.  Then we will have a report on foreign currency operations or the lack thereof.        we had authority to intervene.  Authority from whom?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What was the question?    

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  The question was:  From where did the authority come to intervene?  The New York Federal Reserve Bank was instructed by the Chairman on the basis of discussions between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.    to for us to begin [intervening]?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, we would have intervened if the  [mark] had continued to weaken.  I am sorry I missed whatever you said Sam, but we would [unintelligible].  After the Polish strengthened relative to [its level] in the Far East.  We would have intervened if it had retreated rapidly again after having strengthened at around the 2.30 level or a little lower, [unintelligible].   

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  The mark hit a peak in the Far Eastern trading  of about 2.36-1/2 and the rates in terms of the other [currencies] were similar.  But in terms of DM it went down to about 2.33 when Europe began its operations.  Also, the Japanese intervened in their the German authorities and also some profit-taking and the rate continued to come down to 2.30.  And then in the middle of the morning here it was down to about 2.28.  So, during the entire period when our markets were open, the rates were coming back into balance and the pressures were subsiding.  But we had the authority to step in had the movement gone the other way and had it looked as though the rates were beginning to spurt back up with the dollar getting stronger and the mark and yen and other currencies weakening.  But we did not use the authority.    

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Did the Treasury say in any specific way what 

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  What were the terms that the Treasury agreed   

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Well, as Paul said, there was a 

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  The market has been quite unsettled all week.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Where's the rate now?  

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  2.28.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I still think that was fairly abrupt.  

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  But we have had bigger moves than it considered a disorderly market?  Did they say a certain percentage change or something like that would be--    feeling on that midmorning that if the mark reversed itself and the dollar weakened--the mark was up to about 2.29 or 2.30--then it might be appropriate [to intervene], depending on the conditions at that moment.  But that was in the context of the reaction to the Polish move.  I don't think that the Treasury or even you have a view as to what rate change [constitutes a disorderly market], devoid of the context in which the rate change comes about, unless maybe it comes about very abruptly.          that.    On Friday the rate in terms of DM again--I hate to keep talking about that one, but it is convenient--hit 2.30 in the European markets.  It started at 2.27-1/2 on the previous trading day, went up to 2.30, and came back down to 2.27-1/2 during our trading day.  Then after the money supply figures were announced, it went up to 2.28-1/4 roughly. So there was an awful lot of movement during many of these days.    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  My sense is that this market has been a very poor market--let me put it that way--right through this period. Is that still correct?    particularly coming as it does near the end of the year when we are told that not only the banks but the corporations are interested in getting their books cleaned up and don't want to take new positions and so forth.  There are not many operators out there making markets, so if anybody has something that he has to do in terms of business, it seems to move the rate by quite a substantial amount with a relatively small amount of activity.  I would agree with you that the   policy of nonintervention.  In fact, I gather at the Federal Advisory Council meeting you had in November that all the banks represented on that Council criticized the nonintervention policy.  At least that is what Don Platten told me.    exactly what they said.        

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It wasn't that much.  

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Yes, it wasn't severe criticism.  

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  My memory is that he said there was 

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  That's correct.  It has been a very thin market, 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The markets attribute that to our 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I guess I said something.  I forget 12/21-22/81-2-  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But when we asked them, the Federal 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  That is what he told us [in New 

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That is what I was thinking.  He thought he 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  It is always interesting to hear two disagreement among the banks.  He presented a view which said that [the FAC members] suspect this [nonintervention policy] has something to do with [the market unsettlement] but there are banks that have other views.  That is also my memory of the written report that they made to the Board at the time.    Advisory Committee members did say that banks not under the FAC might have other views.  I guess that is the way it was.  As I recall, that comment was in their written report but they weren't violent about it.    

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  As a matter of fact, they also said that there was some general agreement that intervention policy should be used sparingly or something like that.  I didn't get the feeling that they had a strong position on that.  That's my recollection.  I didn't think it was a very vitriolic comment.    people report a conversation.    delivered a strong message and we didn't even hear it!    York].   

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Is my recollection wrong?    

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I can hardly remember [what was said].     

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, I'd forgotten it.  But it did come up and I guess they did put in their written report a positive recommendation that we ought to intervene.  They were not frothing at the mouth about it, but it was a positive recommendation.  I asked whether that view was generally held and they said they thought it was by a lot people, but not everybody.  And that was the extent of it.    some general guidelines from the Treasury as to when we intervene or don't intervene that you can speak to?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't know what you mean by general  guidelines.  We always have this problem.  There is nothing I can recite that is good in all seasons.  We developed this interim guideline following the Polish [action], that if [the dollar] took a sudden jump up beyond where it was [against the mark], in essence we'd intervene.  That was after the dollar had already gone up; it was already up about 4 percent from where it had been trading.    

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  At least it wasn't that an assassination attempt was needed to intervene.    intervene on assassinations and military takeovers!    

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  What I'm trying to find out is:  Do we have 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We're developing case studies.  We 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Or we stand ready to intervene.  12/21-22/81-3-12/21-22/81

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  actually what  happened  is  that wewere  quite  ready  to  intervene  and at  the  time  I thought  it  wouldprobably be  necessary.  But  in  every one  of  these occasions  recentlythe  rate has  reached its  nadir  in  European  trading  rather  than  in  theUnited States.  So  every time  we've gotten  geared up  to  do  something,the rates have  come off  the peak  or off  the  floor.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Well,  people  know what  Beryl  Sprinkeland Don Regan mean by a crisis  and, therefore,  they probably  expectsome  intervention.  That  is  obviously clear and, therefore,  maybe  thatis  one  reason  the  rates  are--

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Or  the Germans  do  it  ahead of us,  or  for us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that  is  what has  been happening.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  Both  the  Germans  and  the Japanese  intervenedduring  this  latest  spate  of  activities.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The Japanese  intervened very heavily.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  reserve  the right  to  intervene when wefind it  necessary.  Sometimes  our  patience  is  more  strained than atother  times.  We  also want  to  cooperate  if  possible.  And  we have  beencooperating, I guess.  We have nothing  to  approve here.  Norecommendations?

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  The other  Polish problem  is  their  debt.  Do wehave  any feeling  at  all  on when that  will  start  to  come  to  a head?

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  Well,  I don't know when  it  is  going  to  come  to  ahead.  The banks were  supposed to  enter  into  an agreement,  a priorcondition of  which was  that  they  should receive  the  arrears.  But  theydidn't  receive  the  interest  in arrears.  They received a telegramasking  if  they could make  $350  million  of  loans  available.  The  lastwe  heard is  that  the banks were  talking to  each other about what  todo.  But  there  does not  seem to  be, at  least  among  the people we talkto,  any great disposition  to provide more money to  the  Poles.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  Poles  [were  given]  a rather  clearmessage  just  a couple  days before  martial  law was  imposed.  Theycalculated that  they owed about  $350 million  of interest.  They didnot  have  $350 million.  So,  [they were  told]  they could pay theinterest  for  3 or  6 months,  and then  the  rest  of  the  agreement  couldgo  into  effect.

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  They requested what  they called  a bridge  loan.Some  of  [the  banks]  thought  it  looked more  like a pier  than a bridge.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  that  situation is  very much up  inthe air.  I  find it  a little  difficult  to  see  that  anything is  goingto  be  done unless  the  Russians give  them money to  pay  the debt  and paythe  interest between now  and the  end of  the year.  I don't  think  theywill  last.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  The end of  the year  is  the due  date,  is  it?12/21-22/81

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  there was  a date  earlier  inlenders]  don't get  paid by the  end of  the year,  then  they will  have  toadmit  that  the  loan is  in  default--or at  least  that  it  isquestionable--on  the day  that  they have  to  make up  their books  for  theend of  the year  and decide what  to  do about  it.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Most  of  the  interest  started to  be in  arrears  on

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  This  covers  three-fourths  of  the year.  The  banksand  the  Poles  were  supposed  to  meet  on  December 28,  I think,  to  signthe agreement;  and they wanted  the payment  cleaned up  two weeks  early,which was December  14,  so  they wouldn't  sit  down  at  a  table  and not beable  to  sign.  But  that  day passed and  the payments weren't  made.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  The banks had told their  committeesbefore the  takeover  that  if  the  Poles  did pay the  interest,sympathetic consideration--that was  the  term  they used--would be  givento  some  new short-term trade  credits  of  60  to  90  days.  Not all  thebanks would do  that,  but  that  was  the  language  they  agreed on  if  thePoles  didn't default.  And then  everything got overtaken.  Nothingprobably would have  happened anyway, but any chance  of  a solutionbeing reached certainly got wiped out  temporarily by that  takeover.So,  everybody  is  in  disarray.  I don't know how many banks are  goingto  move to  increase  their  loan  loss write-offs.  I checked around  butnobody that  I am aware  of  has  done  more  than  50  percent  as  write-offs.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I wasn't  aware  anybody had done  that  much.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  A  couple of banks  said  that  they hadincreased their  loan  loss  reserves by  50  percent  of  the  Polish  loans.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  They might  have  to  proceed differently withrespect  to  the  1981  maturities  that  should have  been rescheduled butnow have  fallen  through.  They might have  to  write  off  50  or even  100percent.  But  most  of  it,  of  course,  is  into  the  future.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Sternlight.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Mr. Chairman,  if  I may,  I also  have  arecommendation  to make:  namely,  that  the  leeway  for  changes  inholdings  in  the  System Account, which  the  Committee voted to  enlargeto  the  $4 billion level,  be  left  at  that  $4 billion level  up to  thetime  of  the next meeting.  Our  projections make it  look as  though wemight need to  absorb  something  like  $3 billion  of  reserves  duringin  the  last  several weeks.  That  concludes  my remarks, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any comments?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  You used up  $3.8  billion  of  the  $4 billion?  Isthat  right,  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Yes,  and we may have done  another  $150million  today because  we  took  some  notes  from one  foreign  account.12/21-22/81-6-

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Don't you  feel  you need  a little  more  leeway onthat?  You  are pretty  short at  this  point,  aren't you?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  the  leeway needed  to  last  only  throughtoday or  tomorrow, so  we  were willing  to  run it  right up  to  the  line.After this  meeting a new  leeway  is  established.  We may have  a littlemore  to  add  on an outright  basis  but as  soon  as  we get  into Januarywe'll  have  to  swing around  the  other way.  It  is  to  provide the  leewayfor  a possibly  large move  in  the  other direction, a  large  absorptionof  reserves,  that  I think  it  might be  useful  to  leave  that  limit  atthe  $4 billion level.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  The  $4 billion runs  from when  to when?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  It  would run,  I believe,  from the  day afterthis  meeting--that would be Wednesday--through February 2.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  So  you get  a new  $4 billion starting  tomorrow.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  It's  $3 billion unless  the Committee  approvesthis.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  It's  $3 billion.  Oh,  I see what  you mean.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Is  there  any  thought  in  the market  that  thestrengthening  in  the  money supply we've  seen  recently is  due more  tothe  economy perhaps being  not as  weak as  we  thought versus  the  Fedmaking an  overt attempt  to  pump up  the money supply?  Is  there anysense of  that?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  I think there's  some puzzlement  about  thestrength  that  market analysts  have  seen.  I don't have  any  sense thatthey  are  associating  it with  the  economy being  stronger.  Some  of  themsee  other special  reasons;  some have  the  same  sort  of  temporaryparking place  idea  that  we've kicked  around here.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  A precautionary  type--

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  A precautionary  [move  to]  higher  savingsrates.  There are varying estimates about  the  strength  of  the  economy,but  I haven't really gotten much  sense  of  people  relating theaggregates  to  that.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Well,  it  is  a  strange bulge  for  this  part  of  arecession.  It's  out  of  character  for  this  stage  of  a recession.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  The Bluebook made  reference to  an  anticipatedreduction  in  the  rate of  money growth  for  the  last part  of  December.Does  that  appear  to  be probable?

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  A  lot  of people  in  the market  expect  thatalso.  Steve might want  to  comment  on  the particular Bluebookreference.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  look  forward to  it  with our usualconviction.12/21-22/81

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  I didn't  get  an answer, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  answer  is:  Nobody  knows.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Two  independent  staffs within  the FederalReserve  System are projecting a decline  of  varying magnitude.  So,that might  add a little  to  [one's  conviction].

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  The New York  staff  has  a little  more  of  adrop.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Have  you both been  wrong before?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD and CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Maybe you can  get  a better answer ifyou ask why they are projecting  that,  Larry.  At  least when  I've  askedthat  specifically, the  answer  is:  Because  it  has  gone  up  so  fast,  itought  to  slow down.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are  there  any other questions  that  canhave  equally  enlightening answers?  No other  comments?  We have  aproposal  on raising  the  [intermeeting]  limit  to  $4 billion.  Is  thatacceptable?  Hearing no  objections--

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Is  it  symmetrical,  plus  or minus?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.  That  is  accepted.  We need  to  ratifythe operations.  Without  objection we will  ratify the  operations.  Onmy agenda I have next  the  longer-run ranges  for monetary aggregatesand then  the  economic  situation.  It  seems  to me  that  it may be  alittle better  to  take up  the  economic  situation  first.  If  that  seemsmore  logical  to  other people, we will  call  upon you  first,  Mr.Kichline.  Did I decide on  the  other  order when we made  up the agenda?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  I was prepared,  though.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]  I might note  that  the  CPI  should be  available  tomorrowmorning.  And, unfortunately, new orders  figures  will be  availabletomorrow afternoon.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm just  looking at  the  Greenbook.  It  hasnational  defense spending  declining every quarter.  Is  that  correct?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  That's been  corrected in  the  errata.  I thinkwe  reversed the  lines  for  that  and the  state and local  sector.  Stateand local  spending was  shown  to  be  rising each and every quarter andthat  should be negative.  Those  lines,  unfortunately, were reversed.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  But  the  state  and local  sector  is  approximatelydouble the  size  or more  of  the defense  sector,  so  those  declines  instate and local  are  quite  substantial,  of  course,  in real  terms.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Yes,  they are.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  You  said you assumed  that retailsales  would be  going up  somewhat nominally both this  month and in12/21-22/81that  they  think  the  reasonably satisfactory pre-Christmas  sales  arethe  last  gasp  and  that  there  is  going  to  be a major fall  in  retailsales  in  January.  They had  a poor  October-November.  Since  thenthey've  done  reasonably well  with all  these  sales;  they ran  a 12percent  increase  in  nominal  terms.  But  they  expect  January to  beextremely poor, for what  it  is  worth.  Generally speaking,  thebusiness  CEOs  I've  been  speaking with, as  distinguished from  thefinancial  CEOs,  are much gloomier and expect  a greater-than-averagerecession  and, some  of  them  [are  especially gloomy].  I'm not  talkingabout  the  interest rate  sensitive  industries  but,  for example,  carloadings  on the  railroads.  The head of  one of  those  railway outfitssaid  that  it  was  the worst he'd  seen  in--I  forget  the  period of  time--many, many years;  it  was worse  than  in  the  1974-75  drop.  There  is  alot  of  gloom  and doom in  the business  community, whereas  I  think  inthe  financial  community  there  is  an assumption  that  the  recession willbe more  or  less  an  average one.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I'd  be  interested to  know what people  arehearing about  the  labor  situation.  Jim puts  together  some  tables  onwage  concessions,  every week or  so  I guess,  and they are  lengthening.I was on  the  plane  Friday with a  fellow who  recently retired as  headof  one  of  the major  trucking companies,  and  he  said that a  lot  of  theTeamster  locals  are  likely to  go with just  a cost  of  living  increasebecause the  competition  is  just  tremendous  and,  indeed, a  lot  ofunionized trucking  companies  look as  if  they are  not  going to  make  it.What kind of  noises  do you  hear as  you  talk  to  CEOs?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I hear  throughout my District  a sense  that  labornegotiations are not  going  to  be  as  tough--that  there will beconcessions  and  that  there  may even be some  inroads  into  cost  ofliving  indices.  But as  far  as  the  outlook goes, what  I hear  is  thatthey think  the unemployment  rate  is  going  to  go  higher  than in  theGreenbook  forecast.  I hear more  and more  stories  of  lay-offs;  and  itis  that  fear  of  lay-offs  that  I think is  affecting  the  climate  inwhich these  wage negotiations are  taking place.  I share Tony's  viewthat  there  seems  to  be  more pessimism  in  the manufacturing area  thanin the  retail  and  financial  areas,  but  what I get  is  uncertainty.  Weare  in  the phase  of  the business  cycle where  there  is  a downward slideand nobody has  a good feeling about  whether  that  slide  is  going  toaccelerate  or  taper  off.  There  is  a  feeling  that  the  economy willrecover  in  the middle  of  the year,  but  I would guess  the  sentiment  isthat  the  recession will be  average  to worse.  And that,  too,  iscontributing to  a more  favorable  [climate  for]  wage negotiations.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Are you  going  to  report  a  lot  of  plantclosings?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I wouldn't  say a lot  more  than we are used to  inmy part  of  the  country, but  I am hearing of  more  cutbacks  in  the workforce  in  the  plants  that  are  operating--not  outright shutdowns  but[reductions  of]  450  here  and  800  there.  It  is  very common  [to  hearsuch  reports]  in  talking  to people  and  they are very common  in  thenewspapers and  radio  reports.  And it  seems  to  be widespread;  it  iseven happening  in parts  of our  District where  they usually don't  feelrecession  as  much.  There  is  a part  of  Pennsylvania  that  is  generallyfairly  insulated  from  that,  and reports  from  there  are  about aspessimistic  as  elsewhere.  So,  it  seems  to  be very widespread.12/21-22/81

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Eastern  Pennsylvania  you mean?

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  There is  an area around Lancaster andHarrisburg,  the South Central  area, where  generally the unemploymentrate  is  well  under  the national  average.  We  have a director  fromArmstrong Cork  in  that  area  and he  says  that  even Lancaster is  feelingit  this  time  around and they usually don't  feel  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  On  the  specific question--I'll  comment  [on  mygeneral views]  later--I  think  there has  been within  the  last  30  to  45days  a decided  shift  on  the part  of  labor out  our way.  Their focus  isnow shifting  from  concentration on  the  financial  aspects  of  thepackage  to  the  job per se.  For  example,  the  UAW has  indicated awillingness  to  reopen the  auto workers  contract;  the Teamsters  havereopened  [their  contract]  and  the  trucking people  that  I talk  toexpect  some  significant  concessions  there.  The  UAW has  specificallysaid  they will  reopen the  Harvester  contract;  there they are  going totry  to  get  rid of  the  last  increase  that was  given in October andthere  is  going to  be  a discussion  about  the  COLA  increase  coming up  inthe next  couple  of months  as  well  as  the pension  increase  that  isscheduled  for April.  Harvester  expects  to  get  a hundred milliondollars a year  out of  the renegotiation  the  union has  authorized.  Iwould  echo Tony's  comments;  the  industrial  CEOs  I have  talked to  areextremely gloomy and are  expecting a very difficult  1982--a  far  deeperrecession than most of  the  financial  people  I've  talked to  anticipate.Therefore, I think they are  going  to  go  into negotiations  with  atougher attitude  than  they might  have  had six  or eight months  ago.  Ithink  there has  been  a big  change on that  front.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  On the  other  hand, notwithstandingwhat  I said earlier,  I was  talking with Citibank's board of  directorslast week and I went  around  the  table  and asked them what wagesettlements  each plant expected  to make.  I was  surprised  that everysingle man at  that  table  who headed a  large  company said between  9 and9-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Were they unionized?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Most of  them were  unionized.  Butwhen I asked them  if  they had any plants  that were  nonunion, becausesome  of  them were  very  [diversified],  they  said it  didn't make  thatmuch difference in  their company as  a matter  of policy.  Quite a  fewsaid, however,  that  they expected  some productivity increases  and thatthe  net  increase  in labor  cost might  come in  around  7 percent.

MR. SCHULTZ.  I have  a comment  on  work rules.  When JohnSagan was here  for  the Conference  of Chairmen,  he  indicated that atone Ford plant where  they had  44  work rules  they  had gotten  the numberdown  to  6 or  something  like  that.  There were  some  major changes  inthe  work rules which he  thought was really  significant.  Are youhearing that  kind of  noise  too?

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Yes.  The  scope of  the  cutbacks  that  GeneralMotors  announced on Friday  for  their white  collar workers  was  ratherastonishing.  They are  freezing pay, cutting back vacations  from six12/21-22/81-10-weeks  to  two weeks,  and putting in  a major  cost-sharing provision  intheir  medical  insurance programs--all  three  at  once.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  But  where  the  threat  is  clearlycoming from  imports  in  addition  to  the  depressed economy, they tell  memanagement  has  a much  stronger case  in  getting  labor to--

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Well,  obviously, in  this  case  they chose  to  dothe  [cutbacks  of]  white collar  workers  with a view toward  trying  toinfluence  the  [labor  union]  negotiations.  But doing  that  kind ofthing for  150,000 white collar  workers  is  a big, big bite.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  But  I think there  is  going  to be  asignificant  divergence  in  the wage  settlement  between manufacturingand  service industries.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I wonder whether  this  kind of  thing  isever  reflected  in  the  statistics.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  some  of  this  is  showing  up  now.  There  ismuch more  improvement  in  manufacturing wage  increases  this year  thananywhere else.  That  is  where  the big  improvement has come;  it's  inthe  average  hourly earnings  index.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  right.  I don't  see  much  in  thenonmanufacturing area.  I was  talking  to  some bankers  out  in Chicagoand they were  all  reporting  that  they have  in  their  plans  11  percentor more  for wage  increases.  I  think they are  a little  behind thetimes, but  so  it  is.  Any other  comment  while we  are on  the  subject?Let's remain  on  this  subject  for  a moment.  Does  anybody else haveanything?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  It's  a  form of  rational  expectations--that  is,the  expectation  that  your employer may go  bankrupt.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  They wait  for  that  expectation until he  ispractically on  the  edge.  That  is  true.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Actually, Frank,  the capacity utilization  inthis  [forecast]  doesn't  get  down to  where  it  was  in  1974.  It bottomsout  at  73  percent  and in  1974  it  was  69  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I thought  the  chart  in  the  Greenbook showed  thatwe  are already  down  to--

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  No,  I think Nancy's  right.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  There  is  a  revision  that was  passed out.  Did yousee  this  here?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  This  is  a revised  one.  It  says  capacityutilization, total  manufacturing--

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  That  is  for  1980,  you see.  Look back  to  the--

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  All  right.  Okay.12/21-22/81-11-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any other  comment  on  the  wage  cost/pricesituation?

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  I think there  have  been  some developments  on theprice  side  as  well.  There  is  the price  cutting  in  retail;  withChristmas  sales  it  is  hard  to  tell  how it  is  going  to  work  out butthere  are clearly  some price  cuts  there.  In  the  automotive  industryit  has been demonstrated that  when  the manufacturers go to  rebates,etc.,  that  kind  of  price  [cutting]  tends  to  bring higher  levels  ofsales,  and I think  [price  cutbacks]  are beginning  to  [reach]  back intothe  raw materials.  There  is  a very big  overhang internationally  inaluminum ingots,  for example;  the  book price,  I think,  is  74  cents  apound and  the  trades  are  taking place at  about 49  cents  a pound.  Sothere's a very appreciable difference  in  some  of  the  raw materialsareas, which ultimately ought  to  show up.  So  I think there has  beenprogress on  that  front  as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are  commodity prices  still  declining?  Ihaven't  looked at  that  for  a couple  of  weeks.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Yes  they are,  but much  less  than  they had beenearlier.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  For  raw industrial  commodities, we  are now backto  something like  [the  level  of]  the middle of  1978.

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  Right.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Jim, will  the  CPI pick up  the pre-Christmassales?

[SECTION]

MR.  [KICHLINE]?.  This  next  one?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Yes,  the  December  CPI.  Do  they have  a way of[measuring]  the  widespread sales  that are  taking place?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Well,  they  are  supposed to  take  into  accountactual  transactions prices,  but  there  is  a question as  to  how wellthey can  do that.  The report  tomorrow is  going  to  be  for November,  soin  any event  we wouldn't be picking up what  is  happening now untillater  in January.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  that  exhausts our wisdom on  wages andprices,  is  there  any other  comment  on the  business  outlook generally?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  In  the  midst  of  this  gloom, there  is  onesubstantial  difference  and that  is  that  a major  tax cut  is  already  onthe  books.  I think this  lends  a certain  support  to  the  [expectation]not  in  the  first  quarter, but  looking to  the  second and thirdquarters,  that  the  economy is  going  to  come--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Isn't  there  a law  that when everybodyexpects  an upturn--if  it  looks unanimous--it  isn't  going to  happen?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I have a few butterflies  about  it  myself.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  In  terms  of  the business  picture,  this  is  abit  of  an outlier  observation, but  some  of  the business  types  that  I12/21-22/81-12-have been talking  to,  in  the Minneapolis  area  at  least,  clearly arealready at  the point  where  they are  looking across  the  valley.  Evenfrom the  nonfinancial  types  I don't  get  that  sense  of  gloom  that Mr.Solomon  and Mr.  Boehne  are picking up.  I  think there  is  a recognitionthat  we have  had a very, very steep  decline;  but  they are  alreadyclearly looking out  to what  they think  is  going  to be  a very strongsecond half  of next  year.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  There  is  a widespread  feeling amongbusinessmen--they all  volunteer  it--that we have  a dualistic  economy:that  people are  lucky  to  be  in  the  service  sector  because  they aren'tgoing  to have  it  very tough.  The  head of  IBM was  telling  me thatbusiness  is  absolutely booming.  They make a  distinction between wageincreases  in  the  service  sector  as  against  the manufacturing  sector.It  is  the manufacturing people and  the people who  ship  the  bulky stuffwho are  talking about  how serious  they think  the  current  situation  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  does  Texas  say, Mr.  Boykin?

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  I reported at  our  last  meeting that  there  seemedto  be  a  slight  slowdown in  the  energy  area, particularly  in  drillingactivity.  I'm  told now that  that  has  reversed.  There were  two  rigsin  the pen  last  time  but  those  are  out.  They tell  me  that has  turnedaround a little,  although they  are  expecting a bit  of  a  slowdown  inthe  rate  of  increase  for  1982.  In  the  manufacturing end, we  reallydon't have  all  that  much  [change];  but  in the  semiconductor business,which  is  a  large  employer,  they are  taking  an extended Christmasholiday.  They are shutting  down until  January 11.  The agriculturalarea,  though,  is  an  area of  concern.  As  we know, the  prices  to  thefarmers  are not  good;  the  crops  have  been very good.  We are  told thatour agricultural banks  probably are  going  to  have  to  carry over morefarmers  than  they ever have.  And they can probably carry  them  thisyear, but without  some  improvement  there  are going  to  be  some veryserious  liquidation problems.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Let  me  ask you  a  [question].  The  loan/depositratios  in agricultural banks,  remember, had been pretty high  in thespring  of  1980,  at  about  68  percent nationally.  When we  looked  atthem here not  too  long ago,  a couple months  ago,  they were down  to  60percent.  Are your banks pretty much  in  that  same  situation--thattheir  loan/deposit ratios  are pretty good?  Do  they have plenty  ofroom  to make  loans  if  they want  to  make  them and  carry  them over?

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  Yes,  they have  the  room.  But  the  question  ishow  comfortable  they  feel,  even  though  they have  the  money, about howlong  can  they  stay with  [agricultural borrowers]  in the  expectation ofa  repayment because of  the  price problem.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  What  about  the  land prices?  Again,  looking  atthe places where most  of  the problem loans  tend  to be, people  hadgotten  pretty  extended on  land.  Are you beginning to  see  a break  inyour  land prices?

[SECTION]

MR.  BOYKIN.  I think  so,  a break  in  the  sense  that  the  salesof  farm  lands  are going down.  I have heard  of a  few  instances of  alittle  price  concession, but  there  is  not  a  lot moving right  now.12/21-22/81-13-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  the  story  I hear when people  fromfarm  areas  talk  to me:  that  there  isn't much movement  in  the  pricebut  there  sure  aren't  any sales,  and don't  try  that price  too  hard.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  In  our  District, when  land  that  was  valued at$3500  to  $4000  an acre  comes  up  for sale,  the  price goes  down;  andthey pull  it  off  the market  at  $2700  or  $2800  an  acre.  The  price justdoesn't  clear  the  market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Roos.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Obviously, things  are  relatively slow  in  ourDistrict,  but  I think  it  is  important  to  remember  that part  of  it  canbe  attributed to  the rather abrupt  drop  in  the rate  of money growthduring most of  this year.  As  we  look ahead  into  what next year willbring, especially the  second half  of  next  year,  it  is  awfullyimportant  to  keep  in mind--unless  I am  the  only  one  in  this  group whosees  it  this way--that  the  decisions  we make  this  afternoon andtomorrow will  have  a direct bearing.  They will have  even  a greaterbearing  than what recent  conversations with people  in business  mightindicate  for  the  future.  If  we  choose  to  set  targets  that  imply afaster  rate of  money growth than  we are presently  experiencing, we  areinevitably going  to  have  a step-up in  economic  activity after a fewmonths.  So, what  we do  will have  a direct  bearing, at  least  as  welook  at  it,  rather  than  just  psychological  [effects  on]  decisions  thatbusinessmen might be making.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Winn.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  There are  more  than  the  Polish  loans  out  therethat  are  in trouble.  The  insurance industry reports  a considerableincrease  in the amount  of problem  loans.  Our  Canadian friends  havecome down  and done  a big  real  estate  investment without  taking outfinancing,  so  some  of  the office building complexes  are in a peculiarstatus  at  the moment,  and they may be  coming on  the  market.  My guessis  that  the building boom has about  run its  course--well,  it  may goanother year--but  that  office space  is  starting  to  show up as  a littleon the heavy  side across  the  country.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Ford.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  On  some  of  the points you have mentioned,  in  ourend of  the  so-called Sun Belt  things  are not  really all  that  sunny.Specifically, for  example,  on Nancy's  point  about  the pre-sales  in  theretail  area,  we are  definitely seeing  a whole  lot  of  that.  We  have  45board members  in our District  and a number of  them  are retailers;  theyhave been  telling  us  that  their  sales  are  flat  to  down  in  real  terms.They may have a nominal  increase  in  dollar sales,  but a lot  of  that  iscoming on white sales  that  were  taking place  in December and Novemberinstead of  in January  and later.  So,  they  are a  little depressedabout  that.  The  tenants  in  the  large  Atlanta malls are  concernedabout  their inventories being high  and are having to  do heavypromotions to  keep  their  sales up.  On  the  employment side, we  areseeing  some  rather heavy  layoffs  in  the more  industrialized  areas  ofour  District, particularly in  the housing-related carpet  industry.  Weproduce half  the  carpets  in  the  United  States  in northern Georgia  andthey have  experienced a 50  percent drop  in production  in  the  last  fewmonths.  So,  we  are  seeing big problems  there.  Some  of  our major12/21-22/81-14-employers,  like  Fruehof  in  Florida  and  even Excel  in  Orlando  and theFord glass  plant  in Nashville,  are  all  laying off  big  chunks  of  theirlabor force.  In  the  service  industries, which  someone  else  askedabout, we  are  finding  some problems.  Air Florida,  one  of  the  morerobust  regional airlines,  has had a very heavy cutback on  itsemployment,  as  some  of  you may have noticed  in  the newspapers.  So, weare seeing  pretty much across  the board  in  both the  service and themanufacturing industries  that  the  recession  is  deepening throughoutour area.  In some  of  the  [most  depressed]  parts,  in Alabama  in  theindustrialized areas,  we have unemployment rates  approaching 12  to  13percent.  They are  a little  [higher]  than  the  northern version  inDetroit  and  that area.  So,  we  are  seeing  the recession come  down inthe  Southeast pretty heavily.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Refresh my memory, Mr.  Kichline,  if youcan.  In  the  1974-75  recession  did wage  rate  increases  actually comedown appreciably?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Immediately  after,  as  I remember--in  1975  and1976--there was a  sharp  break  in wages,  and prices  also  came downsubstantially.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I know prices  did;  I couldn'tremember how much wages  did.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  They never had  risen  that much.  Inflation hadnot become  imbedded  in ways  that--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I understand  that,  too.  I really don'tknow whether--

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  When we removed  the wage  and price  controls  inthe  spring  of  1974,  what  happened immediately thereafter was  a catchupburst  of wages.  If  you  look at  a chart  on wage rates,  they wererocketing upward and  then  the  rate  of  increase  came way, way down.But  a very  large  part  of  that  reduction in  the  rate  of  increase  inwages was  nothing more  than a termination of  the  round  of wageincreases  that  ensued  after  the  wage and price  controls  were removed.So,  you  can't  look back  at  the  1974-75  experience.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Wage and price  controls were removed  inthe  spring  of--?

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  April  1974.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  There were  a number of  phases,  I think.  Thefinal  phase  came off  in  1974.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  There was  a holdback  on big  companies  thatextended to  the  spring  of  1974.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  As  I remember, by about  the  third quarter of1975  the  annual  rate  of wage  increase  got up  to  around  the  12  to  14percent  range.  There was  actually an  acceleration of  wage  increasesduring  the  recession.  It  wasn't  until afterwards,  once  the  recessionwas over,  that  it  began coming  down;  then we began  to  get  the bigdownward adjustment  in the rate  of  increases  in wages.12/21-22/81-15-

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  Do you have numbers  down  there,  Mr. Kichline?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  We have  some  numbers.  Unfortunately,  they  areannual  numbers.  On an  annual  basis  1975  still  showed an  increase and1976  is  the big year where  there  is  a break.  I would agree withGovernor Gramley that  the  whole period is  confused;  I think part  ofthe controls were  off  in  1973,  and in  1974  we began  to  see  theacceleration  of  wages when we were  in  that  recession.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  A bunch of  the  controls came  off  in  early1973;  I remember that very well.  I remember very well when I thoughtthe  great bulk of  them were sneaking  off  in January of  1973.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Employers with  5,000  or  more--

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  It  was  continued on  large  firms  as  I remember.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  even remember that.  What werethose annual  numbers  just  for  the  heck  of  it?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  In  1973  the  average  hourly earnings  index hada 6.1  percent  increase;  in  1974,  8.0  percent;  in  1975,  8.3 percent;and in  1976,  7.2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  So  it  was  just  a 1 percent  decline  eventhen?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Then  it  went up  again  or held steady or--

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  It  began  edging up.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Balles.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  It  used  to be  that  second perhaps  only  to  Texas,the West was  fairly  recession proof, but  that  doesn't  seem to be  thecase  today.  Looking around  for some  elements  of  strength, I have beenhard pressed to  put my finger  on  them.  Alaska  is  the  only  one  of  ournine  states  that still  seems  to be  adding  to  payrolls.  Nonresidentialconstruction, which has been very strong,  is  still  above  a year  agobut  the growth  is  definitely  slowing.  And across  a wide range  ofareas  there  is  developing weakness  or  a going downhill, even  in  theaerospace  industry, on balance,  strangely enough.  Lockheed justannounced getting  out  of  the  production of  the 1011.  They are hopingto pick up  something in  defense  orders.  The semiconductor high-techbusiness  that  had such a strong  growth trend has  turned  sour.  Some  ofthe  semi-conductor  firms  from Silicon Valley and elsewhere  in  the Westare having extended shutdowns  because  of  excessive  inventories.  EvenBoeing, which has a huge share  of  the  commercial airline market,  isgetting  increasing numbers  of  cancellations.  There is  morecompetition  from  the Airbus,  etc.,  and even  though  they are  rollingout  a couple  of new models in  the  very near future--the  767  is  aboutto  come out  and the  757  is  expected a year  later--their  sales  aredefinitely down  and  so  is  their  employment.  So,  it  is  hard to  see  thebottom being reached in  the near  future.  The  trend  is  still  downwardacross  a pretty  broad front.12/21-22/81-16-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Gramley.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  [I'd  say]  that,  if  anything, we are  likely  togo  through  a  recession  this  time  which  is  worse,  or somewhat worse  atleast,  than  the  average postwar decline.  We are  talking aboutsomething  that  is  quite pervasive  and quite  deep.  If memory servesme,  the average postwar decline  in real  GNP  is  about  2-1/2  percent.What we are  looking at  is  a  forecast  of  about  a 2 percent  decline,which  is  a milder  recession  than  the  average  in  the postwar period.Now,  recessions  come  in all  different  sizes,  so  this  is  still  aclassic  recession;  there's no  question  about that.  But I have a hunchthat  if  things work out  differently--and they always  work out  somewhatdifferently  than anybody  expects--the area I worry about  thathappening in  is  business  fixed  investment.  And  I think Mr.  Kichlineis  right  that  if  we  are  in  for  a surprise there,  it  will  be  a  surprisein which  the  drop  in  business  fixed investment  is  significantly worsethan  the decline  of  about  4 percent  we are now forecasting.  I thinkbusinessmen  are  very, very pessimistic  for a variety of  reasons.  Oneis  that  they  look  for  a future  of  real  interest  rates  that potentiallywill  stay up  at extremely high  levels  because  of  huge  deficits  in  thefederal  budget.  And they  are pessimistic because  they have beenthrough  a 2-  to  3-year period  in  which each  time  the  economy hasgotten  off  the  ground  it  has  gotten  slugged  in  the  head again  and goneright  back down.  They are pessimistic  because  they are looking  atvery, very  low levels  of  capacity utilization.  And they  arepessimistic because  in some  areas  of  the  country we  have had such[economic]  devastation.  So,  I think we are  going  to  see  a bigger  dropin  business-fixed investment than  this  [forecast].  We  are  likely  tosee  a first quarter  that  looks  very, very bad--considerably worse  thanwhat we  are now  forecasting--and it  may  stretch  out  into  the  secondquarter before we begin  seeing things  turn up again.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I guess  the  tone  of  the  conversation isgetting  a little  too  gloomy  for me.  I would remind you  that  we arehaving  the  largest  tax  cut  in  the postwar history of  the  country.That will  be  taking  effect  in  stages over  a period of  time.  Henryreferred  to  the  10  percent  cut  next June  30.  In  addition,  there  is  asizable  relaxation that  occurs as  of January 1,  just  a few days  away,for  a wide range  of  activities  that well  could have a little  moreoomph  in  them as  a result  of  the change  in tax  treatment.  I wouldpoint  out  that  housing  is  very  low.  I suppose  [starts]  could dropfrom  800,000  to  zero--well,  to  500,000  or  something  like  that--but  thedownside  risk can't be  very large  at  this  level.  Nor  can domestic  carsales  go very much below the  [recent  pace  of]  5 million  for very long,given  the  fact  that  people  still  need cars  in  order  to  drive.  Andinventories  of  cars  on the  road are depreciating and the  stock,  assomebody  said, is  declining.  Fred,  I think you mentioned  that  aare  customarily  sources  of  weakness can't be  that  much of  a  source ofweakness  from  this  point on,  in my view.I'd rather  agree with  Lyle  that  there  is  some exposure  inplant  and equipment.  We were talking  about that  this  morning, and  Iwould be  inclined to  think that  there  might be  a  little larger  declineand perhaps  a good deal  larger  decline  than the  staff has  in  itsforecast.  But again,  for every inch  that  you give  there,  the  less12/21-22/81-17-pressure  there  is  on  financial markets  and money markets.  And  itseems  to  me  that we  can almost, with  a little  lag,  get  a substitutionof  housing  for plant  and equipment  if  in  fact we  get  that  muchweakness  in  the system.  Also,  this  Christmas  of  1981  is  not  good but,on  the other hand,  it  is  not  just abysmal.  Let us not be  too  gloomy;we  ought  to  get  a recovery,  I think,  sometime  in  1982.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't want  to  [catch]  you unawares, Mr.Truman, but  it  might be  appropriate  for you  to  say just  a word aboutwhat  is  going on abroad.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  To  give  you a  little more  time,  would you  liketo  have a  filibuster?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Do you need your  pipe?

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  You just  let  the  cat  out  of  the  bag, Henry!

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  picture  is  broadly  similar to  what we haveseen here  in  the  sense  that  the  economies  abroad have  been growing,although it  has been  small  positive growth.  It  has  been quite modeston average  over the  last  several  quarters.  There  have been  some  signsof  a bottoming out:  There  were  increases  in  the  United  Kingdom aftera very sharp  decline;  and the  German GNP  number that  came  in  for  thethird quarter,  just  released  today finally  on a seasonally adjustedbasis that  one  could understand, shows  essentially zero growth ratherthan negative  [as  it  was]  in  the  second quarter.  So,  there  are  somesigns of  a bottoming out,  though I think we  have  marked down  theextent  to which we  see  real  positive growth  in  this quarter.  Weexpect  at  best  only a modest  rate  of  acceleration  in  the  course  of1982,  reaching something on  the  order of 2-1/2  percent  on  average  as  Irecall  for  the  last half  of  1982.  That  is  hardly a very robustperformance, when you  factor  in Japan, which  in  the past,  even  in  thefirst  oil-shock environment, has  had a fairly good growth raterelative to  the  rest  of  us.Generally speaking,  unemployment  is  expected to  continue  torise  abroad;  and there  may be  some  improvement--maybe  a percentagepoint or a  little more--on the price  side but not  any rapid expansion.One  place where  we have  seen some  shift  in policies,  or at  least  inthat  direction relative to  everybody else,  is  France, where a  somewhatrapid pickup is  expected in both prices and real  growth.  I mightcomment  that  Japan in particular  seems  to  be a serious  problem.  Theyhad about  4 percent  growth  this year, which  looks  good  from ourperspective, but  even the  official authorities  are  not  looking for  toomuch next year, which  clearly is  one of  the  things  that  is  causing  theproblem on the  external  side,  the  current  account  side.  They  justhave very weak domestic demands,  and that  combined with the decline  ininternational commodity prices--imports  are  weighted in  that  direction--is  part  of  the  reason why the  number  on  their current  accountposition looks  so  astronomical.  Although  that might moderatesomewhat,  it  is  likely to  stay up  in  that  range unless  Japanexperiences a dramatic  rebound, which no  one  at  the moment  isparticularly projecting.12/21-22/81-18-

MS.  TEETERS.  Ted, has  the British price  situation  improvedvery much?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It  has  not  improved, particularly over  therecent period.  The CPI  in  the  second half  of  the  year has  beenrunning  in  the  11  to  12  percent  range;  it  had come  down  to a plateauand  backed up.  It  actually got  down almost  to  10  percent  on  a year-over-year  basis  and backed up a bit  as  the pound weakened  in  thesummer.  So  they  are about  back  to  where  they  started when Mrs.Thatcher  came  into power.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  And  they have had how many quarters  of  declinein  real  growth?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Oh,  I don't  know.  It  is  something astronomical,off  my chart  here.  I think  it  has  been  occurring since  the end  of1979.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  something  like  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  Ted, why doesn't  Japan  stimulate  [its  economy]?They have  their inflation  rate  down to  around 4 percent,  as  I rememberthe  figure,  and the  domestic  economy is  weak.  The yen has  been prettystrong.  The  current  account  surplus  is  just--.  What  is  the  reasonthey don't  stimulate?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think there  are  two  major reasons.  One  isthat  they  found themselves  burned badly in  the past  by excessivestimulation,  or  they feel  they have  been burned badly.  And  they hadtwo  rounds of  rapid inflation--less  the  second  time but  it  still  wasworse  than  they expected--in the  yen as you  may recall  in early  1980when it  went  to  260 yen  per dollar,  which was  as  ridiculous  a  level  insome  sense as  the  level  of  the  mark  in August.  And that  was partly aninflation phenomenon.  The  second  reason  is  just  that  they have  thisdomestic  demand one might  expect  would come  from the  fiscal  side.They have  taken  some cautious  steps  on  the  monetary side  though  interms  of  the mix  of policy,  everything else  being equal,  that  tends  tobe  a little  negative  from external  perspectives.  But  their  fear  is  oftheir  large budget deficit,  which they  see problems  in  financing;  theycontinue  to have troubles  with banks  in  Japan  in placing their  longer-term debt.  The banks  have been gradually backing-off  from  this  sortof  short  placement  system  that  they have run  for  years  and  that  hasled to  caution in  fiscal  policy.  Now they have a new budget  in  theprocess  of  being formulated;  and  from  the  indications  I've  seen,  itare  talking about  expenditure  increases  in  nominal  terms on  the orderof  6 to  6-1/2  percent, which does  show some  slight  positive  increasein real  terms.  But  the  rhetoric  is  going  to be  in  the direction ofcontinued  fiscal  restraint.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And they  are very worried about  theirexchange  rate.  They  figure  they are  in  a  "no-win" situation  if  theytake  a stimulative  action, particularly  in  monetary policy.  Theirexchange  rate  will weaken and  they  already think  it  is  too  weak.  Thatwould get them  in more  trouble  on exports,  and  they are  already  in  alot  of  trouble  on  exports.  So how  do  they  stimulate  is  the  question,particularly when  the  budget deficit  might--well,  I don't  know what  it12/21-22/81will  do  to  the exchange  rate.  But  they  feel  they can't  do  it  on thebudgetary side  and  they  can't  do  it  on  the  monetary side  because  ofthe exchange  rate.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  That  is  why when  they implementedthat  1 percent  reduction  of  the  discount rate  last month they combinedit  with heavy intervention.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  May  I ask a question on  the  domestic  end, ofeither Chuck or  Jim Kichline?  This  next  round  of  tax reductions,  theones  that  take  effect  in  1982,  are  those to  a great  extent  offset  bypayroll  tax  increases?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  There  is  hardly any  increase,  is  there Jim?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  No,  it  is  not  very--

[SECTION]

MR.  ROOS.  Is  that  possible  on  these?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  No,  it  is  very small.  On January 1st  of  1982the  tax rate  increase  is  only one-tenth  of  1 percent  compared with  the1 percent  that  went  into  effect  in January of  1981.  And the wage  basecontinues  to  rise;  it  goes  up  something  like  $3,000,  I believe.

[SECTION]

MR.  ROOS.  So  it  is  not  a cut?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  No.  In  total  the  expected increase  frompayroll  taxes next year  is  something  like  $5-1/2  billion.  The  secondstage  of  the  tax cut  for  individuals, when  it  goes  into effect,  is  inthe  range  of  $33  to  $35  billion.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  What  does  bracket  creep do  next year?

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  That  eats  up  another part  of  the  $33  billion youare talking  about.  You have  $5 billion going  for  payroll  taxes?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  The  question  is  how much does  bracket  creep  do?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  Well,  I haven't  thought  about  that  question,so  I don't have  the answer.  I think  it  is  a  factor but  not--

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I think Otto  Eckstein  is  using a  figure ofaround  $15  billion  or  something like  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  $15  billion?  So  it  uses  up a  little more  thanhalf?  In other words,  is  there a real  reduction in  the  effective  taxrates  counting  everything?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  The  effect  is  reduced by bracket  creep, butthere  is  a net  stimulative  effect,  a substantial  one.  We  also  havelow  income  growth next year  and that will  hold down  the  effect  ofbracket  creep.12/21-22/81-20-

MR. GRAMLEY.  The  staff's  full  employment  budget  calculationsshow a switch  of  around  $48  billion  from  the  first  half  of  '81  to  thelast  half  of  '82,  with most  of  it  coming  in  the  latter  half  of  '82.And that  is  something  like  1-1/2  percent  of  GNP.  That  is  a prettygood kick  from  the  fiscal  side.  And  I think Chuck was  right  that  itis  something we  need to  keep  in mind as  a  source of  stimulus  as  theyear goes  on.  I don't  think we  really are  too  far  apart,  Chuck;  I dofeel  that  the  recession  is  going  to  end and we are  going  to  haverecovery.

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well, we  have lots  of  uncertainties andconcerns  in  the business  outlook.  And, I must  say the  mood in  Europeis  extremely  gloomy--more gloomy than  the  actual  trends  justify,  itseems  to  me,  at  the  moment.  But  their unemployment  is  very high andthey are  very aware of  that;  it  is  phenomenally high given pastrecords  during  the postwar period.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That  is  right.  They have  already exceeded  the1974-75 peaks,  partly with the  help of  the United Kingdom.  But allthe  countries have  generally higher  [unemployment now].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Yes,  in many countries  it  is  comparable  toours  or  even higher, which  is  very unusual  just  taking  their  rawfigures.  On  the  other hand, I have  a feeling  that  there  is  moremovement here  on prices  than there  has  been  for years,  literally,  interms  of  a change  in trend.  And that  among  other things  could havefavorable  impacts  on  financial markets  if  anybody believed  it.  Idon't  think the  financial markets  believe  it  yet.  I am not  sure  Ibelieve  it yet,  but  I must  admit  there  is  more gestation  and moreferment  and more  talk  about  lower  [wage]  settlements  than even  thatreduction  in  1976  or whenever  it  was  indicates.  [The  staff has]  somefairly  optimistic price  figures  in  its  forecast.  We  will  see, but  Iam not  sure  they  are  out  of  sight.  Let's  go  to  your commentary, Mr.Axilrod.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let  me  just make a  couple of comments.  Onthe  technical  side,  the possibility exists of  some  redefinition of  M2.What  sounds  logical  is  putting  in retail  RPs,  which would raise M2some  historically.  If  we  take out  institutional money market  funds,it's practically a wash.  That  leaves us  with some  unknown amount ofinstitutional money market  funds  in money market  funds  that  are notlabeled  institutional and that  we don't  know how  to break  down.  Whatto  do  with  IRA/Keogh accounts, which might change  appreciably nextyear,  is  a confused subject.  I'll  put  it  that  way.  It  depends  uponwhat  one  thinks  M2  is  measuring and what  a  transition of money  intothose accounts may mean.  It  might  have been worth distributing, but  Iforgot  about  it,  a little  set  of  charts  that  Mr. Truman's  peoplecirculated  this  morning  [at  the  Board meeting].  The  charts  werenotable  for  showing  that  currently none  of  the main  countries was nearits monetary targets  this year  and  that  enormous  discrepancies--largerthan  for  the  United States  by a considerable margin--had  developedbetween the  different Ms.  There were actual  minus numbers  for M1  insome  cases with  12,  14,  15  percent  increases  in M2  or  M3  as  the  casecountry which doesn't  have monetary targets.  That was  Japan.  I don'tknow what  the  lesson  is  to  that.  But  it  was  an  extremely erraticpicture.  It  was poor--

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  But  they don't  have  the  innovationand the  technology--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They had gradually  declining interest  rates;that  is  the thing  that  has  helped.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Oh, you wouldn't  think some  of  these  othercountries did either.  They have not had  the  swings  in  interest ratesand they  haven't had the  swings  in  the  economy, which may  saysomething  too.  These  other countries  have had  some  technologicalinnovation but  the  impression is  that they haven't had  as much  asours.  But  the discrepancies  in  the  numbers  were even  larger  than wehad.  It  is  a startling picture  of  the  differences between  the various[Ms]  in  those  countries.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We could have  copies  of  those charts  circulatedto  the  Committee  tomorrow.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let's  have  a little  discussion  inthe  remaining time.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I have  a question.  Given  the  tentative targetsthat we  established in  July, are  the various  growth rates  for  the Msnow consistent?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  if  our  projections  are right,  we  think M2and M3  growth just  at,  or  a shade below, the  upper end of  the  rangesis  consistent  with growth  of  M1  at  the midpoint.  That  means  the

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Taking just  the  difference  in  the midpoints  forthis year, a midpoint  on M1  of,  say,  4 percent,  given a 2-1/2  to  5-1/212/21-22/81-22-percent  range,  would  imply 11  percent  for M2  and  12-1/2 percent  forM3?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  but  our projection  is  for  somewhat  slowergrowth  in nominal  GNP  over  the  year, which  tends  to  hold  that  down.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  And  then you have  interest rates beginning  torise  again  in the  latter  half  of  the year.  Won't  that  mean the  sameforces  that  were  operating this  year will  tend to  expand the  rate  ofgrowth  in  the broader  aggregates?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  to  the degree  that  this  year might  havehad an unusual  amount  of  shift  into money market  funds  [from]  marketinstruments  or back into  depository  institutions  that  would nototherwise have  been there, we would have  less  of  that  in  store nextyear.  In any  event,  maybe  somewhat  optimistically, we worked our waydown  to  a growth  of  just  under  9 percent  for  M2  and M3,  but  it  couldvery well  be  a  little higher.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  But  why is  that?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Essentially what you  are saying  is  that  we  mayget  a rerun of  this  year with M1  growth  toward  the bottom end and M2and M3  constantly on  the--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I don't  have  a strong  feeling  that  way,Governor Teeters.  It  is  not  too bad  to  think of  the  change  invelocity  of  M2  as  normally about  zero,  or not much change.  That wouldgive  our present projection  of  M2  some credibility, and  that  is  onaverage  what  happens.  My  instincts  are  not  that  we have  severelyunderestimated it.  But,  obviously,  there  is  not any  room  for error  inthat,  particularly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Schultz.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Steve used the word credibility  several  times.I have been  talking  to  market participants  the  last  few weeks  and thatterm keeps  coming up  in their  discussions  as  well.  In particular,just  to  give  you  three  examples  and names  that  might you  remember:  Intalking with  Paul  Boltz, who  used to  be  with us and  now is  atContinental,  and George  Henry who  is  now up  on Wall  Street,  and JohnPhalen  from the NYSE,  I asked  the  question about credibility.  Theyall  said  that  the  credibility of  the  Federal  Reserve  is  much higherthan  it  has  ever been  before.  There  is  a  cost  to  that,  however.  Thecost  is  [related to]  the  second question I asked  them:  What do  youthink would happen  to  financial markets  if  we were  to  change  courseperceptibly?  And they  said they thought  it  would have enormous  impacton  the  financial markets.  So,  I think we have  a  situation  in which wehave built up a  lot  of  credibility, but  the  flip  side  of  that  is  thatwe have  painted ourselves  into  a corner  in  that  if  we don't  staypretty well  on  the  course  that  we  have  generally  outlined, it  is  goingto  have a  rather  substantial market  impact.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  To pick up  on what  Fred said about  credibilityand  going back  to  Steve's  comments  on  it,  we recently had our  fullacademic  conference with  about  35  professors  from  all  around the  West12/21-22/81-23-who  specialize  in money, banking,  and monetary policy research, etc.While  there  are  all  different  points of  view and  schools  represented,from various  degrees  of monetarists  to  Keynesians  to  a few  supplysiders,  the  one overwhelming conclusion  that  they arrived  at when wesolicited their advice on  appropriate ranges  for money growth  in  1982goes  right to  the  credibility problem.  It  translated specificallyinto  a recommendation  from that  group,  for  what it's  worth,  that  itwould be a serious  blow to  our  long-term credibility  if  we didn'tfollow through with  something  like  the provisional  ranges  we  announcedlast  July--that  is,  at  least  a  fractional  reduction as  a part  of  amulti-year program  to  get  the  rate of  money growth down and, hence,the rate  of  inflation.  So,  that  came  across  loud  and  clear.The  other point  I wanted to  make,  having supported Steve'sview on the  vital  nature of  the credibility problem, with yourpermission Steve,  is  to  take  a contrary view with  respect  to  the3-point  range  that we provisionally decided on  for M1  in July forwhich you have  again argued cogently here  today.  Looking  back at  thealternatives  for  M1.  Two  of  them involved  a 2-1/2-point  spreadbetween  the  upper and  lower  [ends];  the  third one,  which we  adopted,had a 3-point  spread.  And for  reasons  that were  set  forth by Steve,it  has  been the  usual  Fed policy  to  widen  the  range of  long-termtargets  when we perceive  increased uncertainty in  the  economy.  Now,that made sense  as  I thought  about it  under  our  former  operatingprocedures, which had  in  effect tended to  accommodate  changes  in  moneydemand more  or  less  automatically.  In fact,  I think  the  big problemin  those days was  that we accommodated too much, which  is  probably  themain reason we changed  the procedures.  But with  the  new approach thathas  been  in  effect  since  the  fall  of  1979,  and particularly with ourrecord this  year--and I might  add that we  got  plaudits  from  thisacademic  group  for what we  had done  in  1981  [whereas]  last  year we hada lot of  scar  tissue  as  you might  imagine  and you have heard thatyourself--we  are  doing a better  job of  keeping within  our  targetranges  and that  has  [helped]  the  credibility problem.  We don'tautomatically accommodate changes  in money demand.  I suspect most  ofus  are uncertain  about money demand in  1982.  For  example,  our  staffthinks,  and  I tend to  share  this view,  that  if  anything there  islikely to be  a further  downward shift  in money demand in  1982.  Butthat  could be  wrong.  In  the  Bluebook Steve brought out  thepossibility that  it  could go  the  other way.  And  to allow  for  thatpossibility, since  we  really don't know which way it  is  going  to  go,  Iwould argue  that,  if  anything, we  ought  to  go  back to  the  2-1/2-pointspread for  the  following  reasons:  If  money demand should  shiftdownward,  obviously the  effective money  supply is  going to be  greaterthan the  actual  observed money growth;  on  the  other hand, even  thoughI don't  expect  that  this will  happen,  if  the  demand  for money shouldshift upward, then  the  effective money demand of  course  will be  lessthan  observed money growth.  Net, bottom  line,  if  we  are uncertain, asI am, about what  might happen  to  money demand next  year,  I think weshould narrow the  range of  possible  effective money by narrowing  therange  of  observed money growth, which  is  the  only thing  that we  cancontrol.  So,  at  this moment,  without hearing  other views,  I amleaning  toward going  back  to  that  spread of  2-1/2  points  that we  hadbefore.

MR. BALLES.  Well,  if  I had to  commit  myself  today,  I'd gofor  3 to  5-1/2  percent  instead  of  2-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent,  but  that  isjust  provisional  until we have  had a  lot more discussion.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  3 to  5-1/2  is  only 2 percentage points.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  No.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  3 to  5-1/2  is  2-1/2  points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  With that  I  think we  can agree.  GovernorPartee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  One  of  my problems  with  talking about moneydemand is,  as  you  say, that  we  don't  know what  it  will  be  beforehand.I never  know what  it  was  afterwards!  It  seems  to  me  that  what we  saywas  a change  of  money demand is  just  the  residual  that  one  can'texplain.  So  I am a  little  reluctant  to  do a  lot  of  changing on  thebasis of  that,  although  I suppose  one could  say  that  this  year  thereseems  to  have been  a better  economy until  recently than  one would haveexpected, given  the  very low money growth  that  we had  in M1-B.  Iassume you  are  talking about  M1-B.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  When you  are  talking about money demand, you arenot  talking  about  the  [broader measures]?

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  No, all  my remarks  were  on M1-B at  this point.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  On  the  technical  side,  I don't  really understandI just  don't  know how  it  will  go.  In addition, we have  theM2  either,  but  one  thing  that  has disturbed me  about  it  is  that  itseems  to me  to  be  subject  to  the  possibility of  coming  in higher as  aresult  of  the  structural  changes.  Steve mentioned it.  We have  IRAand Keogh  accounts, and nobody really knows how  they are going  to  goover  the  next year.  They involve  a very long-term commitment  offunds,  but  there  is  a very desirable  tax  effect  from  [getting  intothem]. fact  that  people who  are uncertain  about  the  future at  least  now havethe  option  of  going  to money market  funds  from  the market  itself.  Wehave seen  continued rapid growth  in  recent  months  in the money marketfunds,  partly because of  the  uncertainty, and  that  could continue  inthe  period ahead.  But  even more broadly, all  of  the efforts  on  thepart  of  the  government  and the  administration  to  stimulate  savingscould be  successful.  That  is,  we  have  IRA/Keoghs,  the  tax  [cut],  theall  savers certificate,  and the  reduction in  the  maximum rate  onearned  income  from 70  to  50  percent.  And if  [such  saving]  were  tomaterialize, it  seems  to me  it  would tend to  show up  in  the M2  number.Now, you have projected an  increase  in  the personal  saving  rate  fornext  year.  You mentioned the  decline  in  the  increase  in nominal  GNP--there  is  an  increase of  1/2  percentage  point,  I think--but  there  isalso  a  1/2  point  increase in  the  saving  rate projected  from  1981  to1982.  So  I wonder  whether, in  fact,  we don't need  in  that broaderaggregate  to  allow  for  the  possibility at  least  that  there  is  going  tobe  a larger  gross  flow that  makes  up  the picture  of  the  new  economy.Now,  I don't  think what  I say applies  to  M1-B.  There may be somedownward drift  in  the  demand  function.  But  it  is  associated mainlywith  transactions  except  for very, very  temporary periods  such as12/21-22/81-25-right now when maybe NOW accounts  have  some  extra  money in  them  as  aparking place.  I am not  saying anything  about numbers  because  I thinkit  is  too early to  do  that,  but  as  we  look  ahead I think we  shouldtake  into account not  only what Nancy said  about  a tendency to miss  onthe M1 versus  M2  and M3,  but  also what  the  effect of  a changingstructure of  the  economy would be  on  the  comparison between M1  and M2and M3.

MR. MORRIS.  Well, Mr.  Chairman,  I am concerned about  theassumptions  the  staff  is  making with respect  to  the NOW accounts  in1982  in  that  they assume  that  the  adjustment  is  largely behind  us.That goes  against  the  experience  of  the NOW accounts  in New England,where  it  took  several  years  to  make  the  adjustment  fully.  And  itseems  to me--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  an  assumption  the  Committee maderather than the  staff,  if  I may just  put  in  a  footnote.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  if  the  Committee made  it,  I also  questionthat.  I would  call  the  Committee's  attention  to  the  recent rate  ofgrowth in  other  checkable  deposits.  In November  it  was  46.2  percent.In  the  second week of  December, when  total  M1-B was up  $800  million,other checkable deposits  were up  $2.9  billion.  To me,  this  does  notlend a lot  of  credence  to  the  idea  that  the  adjustment  is  behind us.Apparently it  still  does  to you,  Steve?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well, yes.  I think  that particular[development]  has  another  explanation.  We are  adjusting essentiallyfor  shifts  out  of  existing demand deposits  into NOW  accounts becauseof  the  opening of NOW accounts.  But  the big  increase  in November  andpresumably  in early December was  also  associated with  the  fact  thatsavings  deposits, which had been dropping  at  a  20  percent  or moreannual rate month-after-month, stopped  dropping.  And  it  is  notimplausible  that  this  is  an  aspect  of  the  same  phenomenon.  That  is,for precautionary reasons  or what  have  you, people  have  increasedtheir saving rate  as  they did in  the  fourth quarter  and some  of  thatmoney has  spilled over  into  what  they think  of  as  the  safest  form  onecan  find that  has a  little  interest paid on  it.  The  turnaround  insavings  accounts and the  increase  in NOW accounts  are--in my mind inany event--aspects  of  the  same phenomenon.  So  I don't  take  that asevidence that  the shift  is  not over.  The only evidence we have  thatthe  shift  is  over,  of  course,  is  that  the  data we got  on the  number  ofNOW accounts--my memory may be off  in  terms  of  the  exact numbers--wasthat  they  increased at  something  like  a  67  percent annual  rate  throughI think also  at  other depository  institutions but  I am not  sure  aboutthe  latter,  show an  increase  in  the number  of  accounts  at  only about  a12  percent  annual  rate.  So,  there has been a marked, clear, anddefinite  [deceleration].  While  the  increase  for  the year  is  about  aswe had projected  in July,  though much more  than we  projected inthis marked  slowing  in  the  increase  in  the accounts.  We can  never  saythat  some  inflow  isn't  [going into]  some  account  that  it  has  taken  aperson a year  to  learn about.  But  given  the publicity  this past yearand given  these  data,  I feel  that  it  is  reasonable  enough to  say  thatthe  shift  is  over.  The  risk we  are  open  to  is  the  risk that  interest12/21-22/81-26-rates may get  a little  lower  than the  staff  is  projecting  and peopleparticularly if  that  interest  rate  is  permitted to rise  some,  ratherthan  the money market  fund.  It  is  insured as  a NOW account;  it  issafe;  and what  do  I care about  2 percentage points?"  Then we  wouldget  a sharp rise.  But  I don't  think there will  be a  shift.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  that  happens,  then what?  I amgetting--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I don't  think that  is  a structural  shift  inthe  same  sense  that  we were  talking  about  this  year.  It's  a  shift,and you probably  should  accommodate  it,  but  it  is  a different  kind ofshift.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  there  are  two  aspects  that  could get us  introuble.  One  is  that  it  is  entirely possible  that  we  could getcontinued  shifts  out  of  savings  accounts  into NOW accounts.  Certainlyit  would be  at  a slower  rate,  but  it  could be  at  a big  enough  rate  tohave a  substantial  impact on  the  rate  of  growth of  the  new M1  andperhaps  lead us  to  set  too  low a  target  for M1.  That  is  what  I amconcerned about  for  1982.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I wouldn't  say that  is  not  [possible];  it  is,certainly.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS(?).  It  is  complicated also by people using  theirNOW account  as  a savings  vehicle--that  is,  by adding  savings  to  theirtransactions balances.  This would again  lead us  to  way  overshootingour M1  targets.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I think the  latter,  too,  is  also  a real  risk.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  right.  There  is  a risk on  thatside.  But  what  do you  do  about  the  risk that  Visa, Master Charge,  anda bunch of  other money market  fund people will  introduce  sweeping  ofdemand accounts  and NOW accounts  into money market  funds  next year?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  That  will  only widen  the  spread between M1  and

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It will  widen the  spread between M1  andM2.M2,  but--

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I think  sooner or  later we have  to  recognizethat we  can't measure  transactions  accounts  anymore.  We ought  tostart  looking  at  other  things.  I think that  is  a clear message.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Gramley,  I don't want  to  go  ontoo  long on  this  scene here.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I just want  to  say a word about  credibility andwhat  it  means  in  terms  of  selecting  targets  for next  year.  I thinkcredibility is  terribly important.  I do  think we have  improved ourcredibility enormously but we  ought  to  understand why  and what  thathas  to  do  with the  selection of  targets  next  year.  We have gonethrough a two-year period in which  the  first  year M1-B ran way  overthe  target  and the  second year  it  ran way under the  target.  M2  ran12/21-22/81-27-over  in both years.  The  fluctuations  in  the  money stock have beengreater  since  October  of  1979  than  they  ever were  before;  so  have  thefluctuations  in  interest  rates.  And  somehow we  have  come  out  ahead.I think the  reason we  have  come out  ahead is  because  in  the pre-erring on  the  side  of  opting  for  a lower unemployment  rate and moreinflation  or  the  reverse,  it  opted for  the  former;  and in  the post-on prices  and take  a higher  unemployment  rate.  That  is  basically whatthe markets  are  telling us.  That  is  basically why we have had  theimprovement  in confidence.  We have  run a much, much  tighter policy.So,  what we  ought  to  do  is  try  to  figure  out what  sorts  oftargets we  need  for  1982  to  run  the kind  of  monetary policy we  thinkis  sensible and worry  less  about  the  announcement  effects  or  thereactions  of  the  financial  markets  or  the public.  On  M1-B, althoughFrank has  a point that  we need to  worry about  the possibility  thatdemand  for M1-B  will  run over  a  5-1/2  percent  upper end,  I think thebigger  likelihood is  that we  will  have  trouble  holding M1  growth up  to2-1/2  percent  because  so  many of  these  innovations,  which have  justgotten  started, will  continue.  So,  I would be prepared  to  live withthe  2-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent range  [adopted  tentatively in July].  Andif  it  runs below,  I don't  think  that  is  going  to  hurt  our  credibility.On M2,  though,  so many  things  are  happening that  to  hold to  a 6 to  9percent  range runs  the danger  of  having an M2  figure  that  is  againway, way above  the  target.  And  I think we  could raise  that  range  to  7to  10  percent  or  6 to  10  percent  or  something like  that  without  doingour  credibility any damage at  all.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Roos.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  I share  to  a great  extent what Lyle  has  just  said.It  seems  to me  that we would sharpen this  discussion if  we  were  ableto  agree upon  and accept  for ourselves  certain basic  targets  relatedto  those  objectives  that we  really are charged with  achieving.  Thetwo principal  objectives we  should have  are  to  achieve  certain targetsof  output growth as  well  as  targets  for  the  reduction of  [inflation]and  concurrently  to  consider what  effect achieving  those  targets mighthave  on  the unemployment  rate.  Now, for  what  it  is  worth,  [let  metell  you what]  our  people projected  [would happen]  if we were  to  comedown  on a broad conceptual  objective  of maybe  a 5 percent  rate  ofgrowth  for M1-B  in  1982  and  1983--assuming just  theoretically thatthat was  achievable by us  and assuming a moderate  slowing  in  thegrowth  of  federal  spending and  the  tax policy  as  presently enacted.They projected  that  fourth quarter  of  1981  to  fourth quarter  1982nominal  GNP would be  something  in  the vicinity of  7-1/2 percent  to  9percent;  real GNP would be  1 to  2 percent;  prices  as  measured by thedeflator would be  6-1/2  to  7 percent;  and this  would result  in  anunemployment  rate  of maybe  8-1/2  to  9 percent.  And in  1983  if  theseassumptions were  held to,  we again would  see  growth  of nominal  GNP  of7-1/2  to  9-1/2  percent, with a bit  higher real  GNP of  2  to  3 percent,price  [increases of]  5-1/2  to  6-1/2  percent--that  is,  a reduction  ofabout  another point--and unemployment still  8-1/2  to  9 percent.  Idon't  know whether  these objectives are  what  the Committee would optfor,  but it  seems  to  me that  it  is  important,  and should be  importantwhen we  discuss  this  tomorrow,  for us  to  try  to  agree on what  we  thinkare  the  tolerable  ranges  of  output growth, what price  objectives wewould like  to  achieve,  and what  unemployment  rate we would be willing12/21-22/81-28-to  tolerate  and  then try  to  establish money growth  rates  that  we  thinkwould achieve  those objectives.Probably some  of  you would part  from the  rationale  that  I amtrying  to present  by saying  that  money growth does not have  a preciseeffect  or  even a meaningful  effect  on output  or  on prices.  I  thinkwhat  seems  to  be  happening  on prices  is  more  than  a reflection  of  thewhims  of  the people  who  are  negotiating wage settlements  and  that  itreally is  a reflection  of  the  reduction  in money growth  that  we haveachieved either purposely or  otherwise.  So,  in  thinking about  thesethings,  I believe we  should try  to  define  our objectives  and  thenregardless  of  how we  come  toward  those--whether  it  is  through moneygrowth  control  or  interest  rates--try  to  agree  on what we  think  arethe decisions  that  would  lead  to  the  output  growth  and price  targetsthat we  agree on  and the unemployment consequences.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I have  three more  names  on my  list.  Iwill not  accept  any more.  And  if  any of  the  three  on  the  list--Messrs. Wallich,  Solomon,  and Black--wish  to wait  until  tomorrow,  thatwould be  acceptable.  If  you have  an urge  to  say something, GovernorWallich is  first.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I am perfectly willing  to  wait  'til  tomorrow.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Solomon,  do  you have  an urge?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I just  was  going to  ask you aquestion  if  you have  the urge to  answer.  I can understand  the  casefor not  including  retail  RPs  and  I can understand the  case  for  notincluding IRA and Keogh accounts  [in M2].  I don't understand what therationale would be,  though,  if  I understood you right,  for  [notincluding]  institutional money market  funds.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Because  they are more  like  [components  of]M3  than M2.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  The average  size  of  those  accounts  is  about$125,000.  The average  size  of  accounts  of  the  others  is  between$12,000  and  $16,000.  So,  there  is  a sharp distinction  in  the  holderand  it  is  our thought  that  the  holders  of  the  institutional  fundswould otherwise be putting their money  in CDs  or market  instrumentsand not otherwise be putting  their money in M2-type  instruments.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Black, do  you want  to--

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  No, I'll  withdraw, Mr.  Chairman, until  tomorrow.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Okay, we will meet  again tomorrow atwhatever  time--

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  9:30  a.m. tomorrow morning.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Weather permitting.[Meeting recessed]12/21-22/81-29-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think we can proceed with  thediscussion of  the  longer-term ranges  in  a very tentative  way.Governor Wallich,  you were  cut  off before.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Yes,  I was.  All  I can  think about  as  I look  atwhat  we are  proposing to  do  [is  whether we are]  setting very tighttargets.  We  are proposing to  finance  a 7 percent  growth  in nominalGNP,  which is  all  inflation and has  a little minus  in  real  growth,with a 4 percent  rise  in M1-B,  [using]  the midpoint  of  the  target.  Inother words, we  are  relying on a  shift  in  the  demand  function  forM1-B.  We  are  also  accepting some  base drift  that we  are carrying  overfrom 1981,  which adds  to  the  tightness.  But  the  fact  is  that  we havehad base drift  from  time  to  time  and sometimes  in very  durable  form.And  the  reason  that  our policy  in  the mid-1970s,  for  instance, nowlooks  so  poor  is  not  that  the  targets  were not  very  tight;  they lookedextremely  tight.  But we  got  an amount  of  shift  in  the  demand functionthat  made  them very loose.  The  growth  of  effective money was muchhigher than we realized.  It  was  again much  higher  than we  realized in1981.  We got  a very large  shift  in  the  demand  function,  on the  orderof  6 percent, which meant  that  the very modest  nominal  GNP growth  thatwe  got was  financeable.So  I would say  that  our main risk  is  really on  the  side ofgetting new additional  shifts  in  the demand  function.  We haveanalyzed these and how they work.  We have  a theory that  they comeafter peaks  in  interest rates.  We  can now foresee  theminstitutionally, with  the sweeps  out  of  demand  and NOW accounts  intomoney market mutual  funds.  All  that  suggests  that  we are  going  tosee,  if  anything, greater  economies  in M1  than we have  seen  in  thepast  and that,  therefore,  the  seemingly very tight  targets  ex postwill not  look nearly  so  tight.  One  can  see  the  same  thing  if  onelooks  simply at  what  is  in  M1.  It  does not  contain that  part of  moneytoday, which I think must be  quite  considerable.  And it  doesn't  takeaccount  fully either of  the  liquidity  enhancing  effect of  theexistence of  money market mutual  funds  that people  can write  one  checka month  on;  that  saves  them half  their normal  bank balance  in  thatthey can  replenish  their bank balance  in  the  middle  of  the month outof  their money market mutual  fund.  So,  again,  I think one  can  seethat  in practice  that makes  the  tight M1  target  of  2-1/2  to  5-1/2percent much  less  tight  than it  seems.Now, I think  the wide  range  that  we  are proposing is  allright  because  there  is  so much uncertainty here  that one  cannotoperate with  a very tight  target.  We  do have  to  realize  that  thesetight  targets probably condemn us  to  quick, short  swings  in business.If  we  follow a  tight money supply  track and  stay on  it,  interest rateswill  move up  and down sharply.  We have  not accepted the  full  declinein  interest  rates  that would have  come had we  stayed exactly on M1-B,and we didn't because  we knew  that  in  1980  when we  came  close  to  doingthat we  got a very sharp drop but  then  a very quick snapback.  Itdidn't do us  any good against  inflation this  time by not  allowingquite  [as]  extreme  a  [shortfall  from our]  money  supply target.Hopefully we  will  get  a more  lasting  effect.  We  do need  a period  ofslack  in  the  economy  if  we want  to  wind out  the  inflation.  Ourproblem is  whether we  are  going  to bounce  back and  forth going  up and12/21-22/81-30-down  to  the very top  peak of  the  ceiling and  then  to  the  floor  as  aresult  of  these  techniques;  to  the  extent  that  we  can avoid that,  weclearly should.Now,  just  a word about  M2.  M2  [growth]  has  usually been inline very roughly with  [that  of]  nominal GNP.  So  I would view withalarm any  increase  in  [the]  M2  [range].  It  is  true  that  there aresome  practices  [in  train]  that may make M2  rise abnormally, forinstance  the  IRA and Keogh  expansion  that may be ahead.  But broadlyspeaking, M2  tends  to  expand  faster  in  contractions  and  expands moreslowly  than nominal  GNP  in  expansions  because of  the way  the  fixedrate  deposit  interest  rates  compete  with market  instruments.  So,  weare going  to  go  through  eventually a period of  expansion.  I wouldthink  that  would hold M2  down, and  I don't  see much harm  in  arelatively  tight M2  ceiling.  I think the  removal  of  institutionalmoney market  mutual  funds  and addition  of  retail  RPs  would be  areasonable  adjustment.  We  shouldn't  be  in  the  posture  of  nevermending  the  structure  of  our aggregates.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Black.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Well,  I think the  recession  that  we are  in mightwell  be more  severe  than  a number  of  other people  seem to  believe.Nevertheless,  there  is  a real  limit  as  to  what we  can do  in monetarypolicy to  cushion  the  decline.  We have  tried a  lot  of  times  in  thepast  to  do  this  and we have  gotten  ourselves  into  a progressively morevexing web of problems  in  the process.  Really,  the difficulties  thatwe will  have  for  the next  few months  are  foreordained,  so  to  speak,and  inflation  is  still  the  underlying problem  that  we  have  to  dealwith.  So  it  seems  to me  that  if  we make  any  significant moves  towardtrying  to  accelerate  the  aggregates, we  run  a very high risk ofreintensification  of  inflationary pressures  and another  debacle  in  thelong-term bond markets.  That would be  very, very bad for  somecompanies  that  need to  tap  that  market  fairly  soon  and  [would lead],  Ibelieve,  eventually to  a deeper  recession and more  unemployment downthe  road than we otherwise would have.But  there  are  two  issues  that  I do  think deserve  some  specialpriorities  that  haven't  been  [addressed]  in  exactly this  way byanyone.  One  is  the  issue  of multiple  targets;  [the  other  is]  thewidth  of  the  target  ranges.  My feeling  is  that  the  combination ofthese multiple  targets  and wide  target  ranges  quite  legitimatelyraises  doubts  in  the minds  of  quite a  few of  our  critics  about  theseriousness  of  our  efforts  to  control  the  rate  of  growth in  the  moneysupply.  I continue  to  believe  that M1  is  the  best of  the  aggregatesto  target  on  and  I really would prefer  to  target  on  that  one alone,although  I realize  I won't  get  you all  to  agree  with that.  Further,  Iwould favor setting  a relatively narrow  range  for M1  and  then  if weshould  find  that  there is  a significant  change  in  the  demand for moneyand we  can agree  that  that  has  in  fact  taken place--although  I shareChuck's  apprehensions  about  that--I  think the best way to  handle thatis  with an  overt and publicly  announced  change  in our  targets.  Now, Irecognize  that  there are  some  technical  problems  in moving  from anadjusted M1  range  to  an unadjusted  range.  It  seems  to  me  that  thistarget  problem  is  reasonably manageable.  Actually M1-B looks  as  if  itwill  grow about  4.7  percent  from the  fourth  quarter of  1980  to  thefourth quarter  of  1981,  and  it  seems  to  me  that  that  should be  aboutthe upper  limit  for  1982.  So,  I am  thinking in  terms  of  something12/21-22/81-31-like  3 to  5 percent.  But  I would want  to  aim at  the midpoint  of  thatand make  a determined effort  to  hit  it.  That midpoint,  incidentally,is  the  same  as  the midpoint  of  the 2-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent  range  thatwe tentatively adopted in July.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Rice.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Mr.  Chairman, I hope  I'm in better  voice  thismorning  than  I was yesterday.  I would  like to  say a few words  aboutcredibility.  I agree with most  of  the varying  earlier  comments  on  theimportance  of  credibility.  However, it  seems  to  me that  credibilityhas  several  dimensions--certainly more  than  one.  Many people  I havetalked to  feel  that  it  was  the  high  interest rate policy of  theFederal  Reserve  that  caused  the  current  recession  and they wonder whatkind of  institution  this  is  that  really wants  to  cause  a recession.On  unemployment there  are  some  credibilities  involved,  too,  exceptthat  it  is  negative credibility.  In  the  long run,  not necessarily  inthe  short  run, we have  to  take  account of  this negative  credibility.I agree with  a good part  of  Governor Gramley's  observation that  somepart  of  the  current  credibility that  we  seem  to  be  enjoying,especially from  the  investor community, is  based  on  the  perceptionthat  we  are willing  to  accept very high  rates  of  unemployment  as  ameans  of  fighting  inflation.  However, over  time we  ought  not  leavethe  impression with  the public  that we  are  indifferent  to  high ratesof  unemployment.  It  seems  to me  possible over  time  to  accommodateboth  the  need to  fight  inflation, which  is  the primary objective, andto  consider as well  the  effects  of  our policy  on  the economy.As  to  the  target  ranges  for the aggregates  for  1982,  BobBlack said much of  what  I wanted to  say about  that.  In the periodimmediately ahead,  i.e.  1982,  we should  in  the process  of  maintainingour  credibility try  to  ensure  that we  do not  starve  the  economy formoney and  that  there will  be  enough money  around  to provide  for  arecovery, which we  need.  Therefore,  I would favor  narrowing thetarget  range  for M1  somewhat.  I would  favor  raising the  lower  limitof  the  range  from  2-1/2  to  3 percent  and keeping  the upper limit  at  5-1/2  percent.  I think  that was  the proposal made by John  Balles.  Thatwould tend  to  keep our performance  closer  to  the  target  and reduce  thepossibility that  there will  be  a repeat  of  this  year's performance,where growth of  M1  fell  very, very short  of  the  target  range.  If  weset  the  lower  limit  higher,  it  would be more  likely  that  the  shortfallin money growth would not be  substantial.  So,  I would propose  a rangeof  3 to  5-1/2  percent;  and 5-1/2  percent  for  the  upper limit,  ofcourse,  demonstrates  that  we  are  sticking with our policy of  graduallyreducing the  rate  of  money growth.  But  increasing the  lower band alsowill  reduce  the  likelihood that  we would starve  the  economy for moneyduring the period immediately ahead.  I would also  say  that we  don'twant  to be  too much influenced,  in my  judgment,  by notions  of  growthin  effective money.  Particularly we  should not be  in  a position oftrying  to  place  too much  confidence in  our  ability to  predict  shiftsin  money demand.  I think we  should concentrate on  the  money growththat  we  can measure.  With regard  to M2,  I would stick with the  rangeof  6 to  9 percent  that  we  had set  earlier and hope that  that  rangewill  turn out  to  be more  consistent with the  target we  set  for  M1.

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I think  it  is  ironic  thatthe  Federal  Reserve  has  switched to  monetarism at  the very time  whenour ability to  measure  the money  supply has  eroded dramatically andour ability to  differentiate money from  liquid assets  is  rapidlydisappearing.  And, therefore,  the  relationship between what  we callmoney and nominal  GNP, which  is  really what we  are  after,  is  becomingincreasingly unstable.  I think we've  lucked out  [this  past]  year.  Wehave  one  target below  [our  objective]  and  a couple  above and  bankcredit barely within.  I hope we  luck out  this  year, but  I wouldn'tknow what set  of  numbers--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  By  this year  do you mean  1982?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Yes,  in  1982.  I wouldn't  know what  set  ofnumbers presented  to  the  Committee would assure us  that we will  luckout  in  1982.  We are  seeing  very strange phenomena  in both the numbersthat  we call  money.  We  had something happen  in November  that  I thinkhas  never  happened before  in  a recession.  We got  a sharp  decelerationin the  economy  accompanied by a  sharp  acceleration  in our moneymeasures.  That  has never  happened before,  at  least  to my knowledge.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me  linger on  that  point  for a second.[Let  me ask]  our staff  experts:  Has  it  ever happened before?  Thesame question has occurred  to  me.  We  only have  a month and a half  ofexperience--

MR. AXILROD.  I have not made a  thorough  research of  the pastrecords.  I would have  to  do  that.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Take all  months  where  industrial productiondropped by more than  2 percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  ROOS.  I don't think  any monetarist  ever maintained  thata  1- or  2-month  trend, upward or  downward, will  have  an  effect  on GNP.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  It  is  more  than that,  Larry.  If  you  look atM1-B  last  year,  its  relationship to  nominal GNP  is  not what  one wouldhave  forecast  at the  beginning of  the  year by any model  that  I knowof.  And it  seems  to  me that  the  situation  is  going to  get moredifficult  in the  future as banks  begin sweeping  consumer deposits  intomoney market  funds.  So,  it  seems  to me, Mr.  Chairman,  that  the  timeis  ripe  to  appoint a new committee  on the  directive.  That  committeeshould be  charged with finding  some target  for monetary policy whichis  more stably related  to  GNP  than  the  targets  we are currentlystruggling with.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  And if  they  can't?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS(?).  Well,  I don't think we ought  to  conclude atthe outset  that  they can't.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Maybe it's  currency.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  It  seems  to  me  it  could be  currency  or what  isleft  of  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  That  is  half  of  it.12/21-22/81-33-

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Currency  has become  very unstable.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Do you  think we  have given monetarism a fair  test?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  I think we  could have  given it  a muchbetter  test  50  years  ago,  or  30  years  ago,  than we  can now.Monetarism does  require  that we are  able  to measure  accurately themoney supply.  That  is  absolutely essential  to  the monetaristapproach.  And once  you  take  the position that  you  can no  longerdifferentiate money  from  liquid assets,  you are  in  real  trouble  tryingto pursue  a monetarist  course.  Now, if  we don't  find  an alternative,then we  are  suddenly going  to  shift  back to  targeting  on  interestrates.  Looking  at  the  short-term options  the  Committee has beenpresented with,  I suspect very strongly that  such  a trend is  alreadyunder way because of  the  fact  that we  had a shortfall  in  M1  in  1981,which  we prized because  it  offset  the  overruns  in the  otheraggregates.  We have  an extremely weak economy and  for Decemberthrough March we  are presented  in  alternative  B with a  target  of  2percent  for M1  and in  alternative C with a  target  of  zero.  Now, itdoesn't  seem  to  me  that  either  of  those  suggests  any greatdetermination  to  give  a lot  of  priority to  controlling M1.  But  thereis  something  in  the  description of  alternative B  that makes  sense  tome.  We used  to  call  it  around  this  table  "maintaining prevailingmoney market  conditions."  It  seems  to  me  that  it  says  the case  for a2 percent  growth rate  as  in  alternative B is  that  it would beassociated with maintaining roughly the present  level  of  interestrates  for  another month.  Maybe  I am reading more  between  the  linesthan  Steve meant  to write  in  there, but  that--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  he  certainly wrote  an analysis  I am  sure.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  But  the  less  confidence we have  in  thesenumbers,  the  more we  are  going  to drift  back to  controlling interestrates.  And  I would prefer  that  we  find  some  other option.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  May  I ask  Frank a question very quickly, Mr.Chairman?  If  we  had a shortfall  in M1-B  this  year and we  have a weakeconomy, how does  that  add up  to  the  conclusion that  there is  littlerelationship  between  the  growth  of M1-B and output?  I think thatstrengthens  the  case  for  the  fact  that M1-B is  a predictor of  economicactivity.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  I would  like  to  see  the model  that  a yearago  would have  forecast  the kind of  nominal  GNP growth we  had in  1981as  being associated with the  kind of  M1-B growth we had.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Which M1-B?

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  You are  invited  to  St.  Louis,  my good  friend!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Corrigan.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Mr. Chairman, given all  that  has  been saidhere  about  the  problems with M1-B,  I would point  out  a littlearithmetic  exercise we  did.  I had my people  go all  the way back tolevel  of  M1-B  that we  should have  in  the  fourth  quarter of  this  year12/21-22/81-34-assuming  that  we had  achieved  the midpoints  of all  the  targets  thatthe Committee has  had  for  that whole  period of  almost  2-1/2  years.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are  you are  talking  about  the  short-runtargets  or  the  long-run targets?

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  No, the  long-run  targets.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  From  the  fourth quarter of  1979  to  the  fourthquarter of  1981?

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Two years?

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Shift-adjusted?

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Yes.  Now, doing these  numbers  gets  a  littletricky, but  let me just  point  out  for the  record that  the  target  levelof  M1-B  that  comes  out  of  that  exercise  is  $429.2  billion.  The  actuallevel,  leaving  aside  the  last  two weeks  in  December,  is  $428.6billion, a whopping  difference of  $600  million.  Perhaps  things  aren'tquite as  bad  as  we make  them  out  to be.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  But  do you  believe  in  compensating errors  as  abasic--

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  My own view, Frank, would be  that  the  errorsover  the period haven't been  all  that  big.  There has  been some  luckand there  have  been some  ups  and downs,  but when you  look  at  theperformance of  policy  over the whole  period, I don't  think it  is  allthat bad.  It  could be  better,  but  certainly  it  isn't  something  thatone  has  to be  ashamed of  by any stretch of  the  imagination.  That  iswhere  I start  from.  I am  under no  illusions,  of  course,  that  we  canmeasure M1-B  right now.  I don't  think we  can.  And I think  thesediscussions about what model would  say what  really miss  the  pointbecause  in  order to  have  a model you  still  have to  plug  in the  moneysupply number  to  get  the GNP out  the  other end.  And quite  apart  fromone's views  about monetarism, models,  or  anything else,  there is  alegitimate  question as  to what  to put  in  on  the money assumptions.My  instinct,  however,  in  thinking about  the  1982  targets,  isto  leave  them where  they are.  In  the  case  of M1,  I think  thelikelihood is  great  that  we will  continue  to  see  strong  forces workingin the direction  of  a continuation  of  the  so-called downward  shift  inthe demand  for M1-B.  I don't  see  those  forces  lessening;  as  a matterof  fact,  if  anything,  I think they will  remain  as strong  or maybestrengthen  further.  But  even  if  that  is  the  case,  I still  have  someconcern  that  later  in  the year  the  targets  that we have  for  M1-B,  evenallowing  for  some  further shift  adjustment,  could prove very difficultto  hit if  the  economy were  to pick up  the way  the  staff  is  projecting,recognizing  that  there  are  an awful  lot  of  private  forecasts  aroundthat would place  the  economy  stronger  in  the  second half  of  the yearthan the  staff  has.  So,  my point  here  is  that  even under  the  best  ofcircumstances  those  targets  for narrow money, particularly as  we  getout  in  the  year, will  prove  to  be  ambitious.  And  in  fact  it  may be12/21-22/81that  the  only way  they will  prove workable  in  that  timeframe  is  inassociation with  a price performance that  is  a little  better perhapsthan  is  currently being  forecast.  Incidentally, Jim,  what  was  the  CPIthis  morning?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  It  is  up  0.5  [for  November]  compared to  the0.4  in  October.  Food prices  rose  0.2,  the  same  as  in  October.  Andhousing performed very well;  it  was  only up  0.4,  and that  reflects  thesizable  increase  in  the mortgage  rate and a  3/4  percent  decline inhome prices.  On average,  it  is  a good report.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Anyway, as  I said, unless  we get  a littleluckier  on prices,  I think  those  targets could be  ambitious  evenallowing  for  demand  shifts.  On M2  I find myself  attracted to  GovernorPartee's  comments yesterday.  I think there  is  a possibility that wecould  see some  rebound  in  savings  in  the  fundamental  underlying sensenext year.  At  least  as  far out  as  one can  reasonably  see,  cash-typeinvestments  are probably going  to  continue  to  look pretty good.  AndI, at  least,  am  inclined  to  the view that  the  IRA  account  could be  abigger  factor  than most  of  the  discussion around  the  table hassuggested so  far.  It  is  very attractive  to begin with,  but  the  factthat  so many companies are  going  ahead with payroll  deduction planswill  make  it  such  a  simple  thing and  so  attractive from  an  ease oftransactions  point  of  view that  that could really generate  somemomentum in  these accounts  as  the  year unfolds.  I must  say I amperplexed  as  to what  that means.  I might  even be  prepared to  make anargument  that  IRA accounts don't belong  in M2  because  they  are  a muchmore  permanent  type  of savings  than  are  the other  [components  of]  M2.I get  that  feeling a  little more  so  when  I recognize  that  it  is  onlythe pure  coincidence of  who  is  managing an  IRA  account  that  is  goingto  determine whether  it  ends  up  in  the banking  system or someplaceelse.  The  distinction is  pretty arbitrary as  to  whether  a particularIRA  ends  up as  a component  of  M2  or  in  a money market  instrument  ofsome  kind or  another.  And  I would at  least  raise  the  question ofwhether  they belong  in M2  at  all.  But  if  we  have  them  in  M2,  theyalone could create  some  real problems  in  terms  of  the  upper  limit ofthe  target  for M2.  That would  lead me a bit  in  the  direction thatGovernor Gramley suggested yesterday even  though  I am hesitant,  to  putit  mildly,  to  change  any of  these  targets,  although  they were  onlytentatively agreed upon by  the  Committee in July.  That  is  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  With regard to  M1-B, based  on the  results  forthis  year  as  a whole  and the  expectations  for next  year,  I fail  to  seeany compelling reason to  expand the  width  of  the  target range.  Andlacking any compelling reason  to  do  it,  in my view we  would make  amistake  to  do  that.  Therefore,  I would be  in favor of  keeping thespread at  2-1/2 percentage points  as  it  is  currently.  Lendingcredence  to  the  credibility theme  that  any change might  be regarded astinkering at  this point,  I would keep  the  spread at  the samemagnitude.  But  I would continue  the  program of  restraint, which Ithink has  been effectively established and,  therefore,  I would be  infavor  of moving  the  range down  to,  say,  3 to  5-1/2  percent.With regard  to M2,  again  given the  results of  this  year--withgrowth running  at  or near  the  top  of  the  range  all  year  long--it  seemsto  me  that  the  relationship  between M1-B  and M2  this year  has  [not]12/21-22/81been  terribly tight.  And because  of  the  questions  about what  islikely  to  occur next  year  in  the  components  of  M2,  which we havetalked  about  a good deal,  and the  fact  that we  have  established enoughpress  regarding  the  "noise,"  if  you  will,  in M2,  I think  this would bean appropriate  time  to  make  a change.  Therefore,  I would be  in  favorof maintaining  the  3-point  spread but  moving the  range up  a bit  to,say,  7  to  10  percent  as  a way of  trying  to  get  it  back  to  a morecomfortable  level  for  an uncertain year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Solomon.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  We  have  heard good reasons  why awider  range in M1-B makes  sense.  There  is  uncertainty due  to  theinnovation  in technology  impact, which  is  likely  to  continue.  Onbalance, weighing the  pros  and  cons,  I would  leave M1-B where  it  is.And  I would leave M2  where  it  is  rather  than  raise  it  if  the  Committeewere  to  agree that  we have  to  show  a greater willingness  to  make amidyear adjustment  if  innovation in  technology continues  to  bringabout  these  shifts.  It  seems  to  me  that  there might  be  some  advantagein  terms  of  this  famous  or  infamous  credibility problem, inforeshadowing  that  adjustment  in  the policy record of  this meeting  ora subsequent meeting  as  well  as  in  the Chairman's  presentation  inconcreteness  and say  it  is  not  just  a cop-out.  We  can point  to  thedivergence between M1-B and M2  and  say that  if  this  divergence  widenedbecause  of  innovation  in  technology,  then we would be prepared  to  makean adjustment  in  the  targets  at midyear.  I think it  would be amistake  for us  to  shrink  from  that.  If  I thought we  were  going toshrink  from  that,  then  I'd say we really  should go with Lyle Gramley'ssuggestion  and raise  the M2  target.  I should add,  since  I didn't  makemyself  100  percent  clear yesterday,  that  I strongly  support  taking  IRAand Keogh  accounts  out  of  M2.  I guess  they would go  into M3;  I am notquite sure whether  they would go  into M3  or  into  something  else,  maybeL.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  They may even vary L.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  That  is  right.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  I still have  some difficulty inunderstanding  the  rationale  for  excluding  institutionally held,corporation held, money market  balances  in money market  funds.  Thefact  that  they average  $125,000  whereas  the average household balanceaverages  $12,000  is  logical;  one  is  a business  and  the  other  is  ahousehold.  The motivation or  the potential  use  of  it  as money--it  isliquidity--is  still  the  same.  So  I am not  quite sure  I understandfully why one  can make  that distinction  or what  the  rationale  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, you  are  treading on  delicatequestions  of what  M2  and M3  mean anyway.  But  I think  [unintelligible]the  rationale  [is  that]  M2  is  more a household  kind of  liquid asset.And  there  is  no difference between  any institutional  money market  fundand  [an  institutional]  CD,  let's  say, which  is  in M3  and not  in M2.You'd certainly put  it  in M3.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  But  an  institutional  CD,  even  ifnegotiable, does  have  a  fixed maturity.  It's  locked  in  for a periodof  time.12/21-22/81-37-

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Three months,  four--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Whereas  this money  in  the money

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But  where does  it  move  to?  It  moves  to  aCD or  20-day commercial  paper.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Or  it moves  to  a checking account  tofinance  transactions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Conceivably, yes.  Mr. Ford.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Before  I make  my comments,  I'd  say on  that  lastpoint  that  I have heard,  but I haven't  seen  evidence,  that  a lot  ofsmaller businesses  tend  to  use these  money market  funds  as  a demandaccount.  That  reinforces  Tony's point,  I would  think.  I don't  knowhow prevalent that  is  but certainly  in  the partnership  areas  a numberof professionals  tell  me  that  they just use  their Merrill  Lynchaccount  for all  the  bills  of  over  $500  that  they have  to pay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Nobody knows.  There  is  some  of  that,  butI don't  think they would  tend  to be  the ones  that  label  themselvesinstitutional  funds.  These are  the Merrill  Lynch accounts  or Fidelityaccounts  or  whatever.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  Yes,  maybe  they are putting  in  the--

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  We are  going  to undertake  a special  survey ofthe money market mutual  funds  at  the beginning of  next year,  isn'tthat  the  timing,  Steve?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It might be  a  little  later  than that,  but  itwill be  early next  year.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  And we'll  try to  find  out what  the  transactionuse  is  and what  the  turnover is  on  them.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Oh, good.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We are  not going to  find  out.  We can  try.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  We can  try.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Well,  that  then  leads  into  another  suggestion Ihave but  first,  with regard  to  M1-B, we  feel  we  can  be comfortablewith the  2-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent  tentative  target we  announced or with2-1/2  to  5 percent, either  one.  I don't  think  the  1/2  point makes  abig difference.  I have  some  sympathy with what  Si  said, certainly, ofnot  making  the  range  too much wider.  Dropping the NOW accountadjustment seems  to  make  lots  of  sense.  So, we would  say:  Let's gofrom  the  end of  year  [and use]  the  last  quarterly average  as  the base,as  we  normally do and as  I think  is  recommended in  the  Bluebook, andgo with perhaps  the  2-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent  range.  But we  are veryconcerned about  the  nature  of  the  innovations  that will  be  comingalong,  some  of  which we  hope will  be  at  least  partly visible by thetime  of  the  next meeting.  Nancy just  mentioned that  she  thought  weought to  do  some more  research  on some  of  these  things  such  as  the12/21-22/81-38-MMFs.  I would suggest  that  we  gear up either  at  the  Washington  leveland/or  at  some  of  the Reserve  Banks  to  get  on  top of  the  IRAdevelopments,  because  the potential  there  is  tremendous.  If  you  takethe  number of  American households  and  even  if  you assume  that  only 10percent  of  them  go  into  a  $2,000  IRA,  it  comes  to  something  on  theorder of  just under  $15  billion  that  could be moved around.  And  ifyou  assume  it  is  20  percent  or--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I just  figured  10  million accounts  at  $2,000  is$20  billion.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Yes.  Okay,  there you go.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  For sure,  President Ford, we  are  going  to bedeveloping  and suggesting a data system  to  capture  the  flows  as  muchas  possible.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Right,  [that  needs  to be  done]  early on.  I wouldsay even  before  that  if  there  is  any way to  find  out  intentions--thatmight  be  too  romantic  for research--it would be  interesting  to  findout  not  just  how many households  but  obviously  the  source  [of  thefunds].  If  people  shift  out  of  NOWs,  obviously  that  is  one  thing;  ifthey  shift  among M-2  type  assets,  then  it  is  less  scary.  I'd becurious  to  know whether people  are  just  going  to  take  a  largepercentage of  the  funds  out  of  their NOW accounts  or whether  they willshift  out  of  other M2  assets  or whether  the  funds  will  come  fromthings  outside  of M2,  all  of  which have  very different  implications.I'd  just  encourage  everybody, especially  our Washington  leadership,  tolook at  the  early returns  on  IRAs.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Or  [it  could]  raise  the  saving rate.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  That  is  right.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  could.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  That  is  what  the payroll  deduction  could do.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  While we  are at  it,  if  we could  find out  anythingabout  these  sweep accounts,  they, too,  as  a financial  innovation havetremendous potential  for bombing us  on  M1-B.  So we  should  take  a lookat whether  among some  of  the major  institutions  there really will bean  outbreak of  virulent  competition  in  that  area,  which could furtherput us  in  the box  of  having undershoots  on  the M1-B  target  andpossibly  overshoots on M2.  What  concerns me most  is  the  fact  that  allyear  long--while Jerry's  calculation was  a very elegant  one  and speakswell  for how we  actually came  out on  M1-B--I've had  the  feeling thatwe  were undershooting  one  target  and overshooting  the  other.  And  forthe  next year we ought  to  try to  figure  out  a way,  if  we  can, to  getout  of  that box  so  that we  are not  always  damned on  the  one  side  forbeing  too  tight  and damned on  the  other side  for being  too  loose.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How do  you suggest  we do  that?

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  Well,  if  the  research  supports  it  and  if  the  earlyreturns  on  IRAs  give  any evidence  that we  should  expect M2  to  getlooser and wider, I'm  leaning  to  the view that  we ought  to  considerjust biting the  bullet  and raising the  upper  end of  that  target while12/21-22/81-39-doing other  things to  indicate  that  it  is  consistent with a  lower ortighter target  on M1-B.  For example,  we might  choose  a base  thatinvolves a  little  less  drift--take the year-end M1-B  figure  if  ithappens  to  be  lower  than the  quarterly average.  Or  if  there  is  someother way we  could start  from a  lower point,  keep  it  down  at  5-1/2percent  and do  something which  in  combination  says we  are  anticipatingthat M1-B  already  is  going  to  be  overshooting, so  we are  tightening upin  that  area and we  think  financial  innovations  really are going  tomake M2 behave  in  a way that  suggests we  can  anticipate a  higher upperend if  the  research supports  it.  That  is  why  I hope we  [won't]  waituntil--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I interjected my question because  Iam not  sure  the research  supports anything.  And  I am not  sure  we willhave  the  research  that  is  going to  support  anything.  The nature  ofthe problem is  that  we  don't  know.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  We  can't  know, but  don't you  think we  can learn  alittle  about  IRAs  because by the middle  of  February we will--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  can  learn  a little  something,  [but]experience not  only here  but internationally  suggests  that  we  are notvery good at  predicting  this  [kind  of  development].

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  Then maybe we  have  to  go  to  Mr. Morris'  idea  thatwe  look  at  some other  things,  although my  thrust  in  the  research wouldprobably be  different than his.  I'd  say,  if  we  are  going to  reexaminewhat we  shoot  for,  that we  ought  to  pull  out  the monetary base  andtotal  reserves  as possibilities, along with whatever  [measures]  he hasin mind, although those  two  present  difficulties  that  everybody herehas  commented on at  one  time  or  another.  Where  we  are presentlystructured,  as  I see  it,  is  that  we  are making  ourselves  subject  tothe  same problems  we  had  this year.  And  I would be  inclined not  togive  up  so  easily, Paul,  on  being able  to  find out  something about  thetrend in  financial  innovation.  You may well  end up being  right, but  Iwould want  to  come  down  on  the research  to  see  if  we  can  find outsomething about  IRAs  and sweep  accounts  at  least.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  Some  information  on  the payroll plans probablywould be  the best  indicator  that we  could get,  if  there  is  a way tofind  that  out  relatively soon.  I think  that  would give  us  some  realindication.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  I don't  know about  the public  sector,  but  our ownbenefits people  are putting  it  into  our  plan to  make  it  easy,  in  linewith the  comment  that  Jerry made.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Yes,  we are proposing  to  do  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORD.  It  may be  that  if  all  other government  agenciesare  going  to  do  that,  we might have  a big  chunk  [of  employers  doingthat].  I don't  know.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We won't  know where  the money  comes  from.

MR. CORRIGAN.  This  really  gets murky because people  can[wait  to put  in  the]  money all  the way out until  April  of  1983.

MR.  BLACK.  That's  right.

MR. FORD.  Yes.

MR. FORD.  Yes,  I'm  sorry.  I just hope you  are not  rightabout  it,  Paul;  you might  well  be  right.  But  I would hate  to give  upso  easily  on  saying we  can't  foresee  innovation  in the  financial

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  I don't  think we  ought  to  give  up  on  the principleof  how  to  treat  these  various  [monetary measures].  We  ought  to  decidewhere  they  ought  to  be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I agree with  that  and  I agree we  ought  todo  all  we  can to  understand what  is  going on.  Mrs.  Teeters.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I wonder  where  the  thrift  plan is  in  these Ms?

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  It  is  harder  to  understand what  is  going  on.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mrs.  Teeters.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I simply want  to  support  maintaining the M1-Btarget.  I have  a  lot  of  sympathy with what Frank has  said.  I thinkwe  do need to  see whether we can  find  something else.  It  may be  inbetween the  two ways  that  we operate  but  I am not  satisfied with whatwe  have.  I am  really very concerned about  the M2  target  because wehad  a 7 percentage point  gap between  the  growth  of M1-B  shift-adjustedand M2.  We  got  ourselves  into  this  situation where we  are below one[target]  and at  or above  the other.  I would guess  that  the midpointof  M2  that  is  consistent  with the midpoint  of  M1-B at  4 percent  is  9percent  so  that  we are  going  to  find  that  we will  do again  what we  didlast year.  If  we hit  the  4 percent midpoint  of  the M1-B  target,  we12/21-22/81will  hit M2  at  9 percent  or  above.  So  it  seems  to  me  this  is  aperfect  time  to  adjust  it.  We  have a history of  a 7-point gap.  If  weaim for  a midpoint  of  9 percent  or thereabouts  for  M2,  that  is  only  a5-point  differential  instead  of  7, so we  are not  repeating completelywhat  we did last  year.  And we'd have  a better chance,  I think, ofstaying within  the targets  and not agonizing  all  year  long  about whichone  is  the most  important  and which one  is  going  over.  So,  I wouldassociate myself  with  those who would accept  the  existing M1-B  target,increase  the M2  target,  and remove the  IRAs  and Keoghs  [from M2].  Wedon't  have  a record of  changing  in  midstream, Tony.  We  have neverchanged  a target.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Never?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  We never  have,  from  the  time  we  [establishedthe  tentative ranges]  on down.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  That's  because we  are  always  afraidour  credibility will  be  injured  if  we  change.  But  if  we  foreshadowit--put  people  on notice  that  we  have  a very clear,  honest  case  oninnovation in  technology--and  everybody  is  aware  of  it,  we  can  beginto  educate  people more  and make  it  easier  for us.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  Yes,  but then  when we  get  down  to  doing it,  wealways  say we won't  do  it.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Or we  make  another  shift  adjustment.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  We'd rather  overshoot  than change  the  target.That  is  why  establishing  them in  July  a year  ahead of  time  is  such  amistake.  We have  no  idea what  the next  year  is  going to  be  like.  Andthis  is  not  a very good  forecast.  As of  the  fourth  quarter  of  thisyear, we will  be exactly where we were  in  the  fourth quarter  of  1979.And  if  the  forecast  is  accurate  for  next year,  in  the  fourth quarterof  1982  we will be  exactly where  we were  in  the  first  quarter  of  1981.That  is  really  a galloping  economy over  two years!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Winn.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  I would like  to  join  the  chorus  of  those  who arecalling  for a re-examination of  these measurements because  I think weare  just playing mumbo-jumbo with  the numbers  game now.  I think wecan  do  a better  job  of providing measurements  of  what money  is  allabout.  And until we do  that,  Fed  targets don't make much sense  to  mebecause  we  just  explain  them away by all  these deviations.  InColumbus,  for  example,  our money market  fund  clearings have  gone  from25,000  a day  to  115,000;  that  gives  you some  idea  of  the  kind ofactivity  that  is  going on  in  that  area.  This  is  the Merrill  Lynchclearing setup.  And here  is  a backward way of  getting  into  thatmeasurement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  the number  of  checks or--?

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  On  the money market  funds.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  certainly is  the  most  active.12/21-22/81-42-

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  I think we have  to  get on with  the measurements.[As  for]  Frank's  point  on  seeking  other measurements,  unless  we havesome measure  of  the  reserve base or  something  else,  we don't  reallyhave  reserveable  assets  involved  in  the  money concept.  I just  thinkwe must get  on with an  attempt  to  remeasure  some  of  these magnitudes.They may not be very accurate,  but they  are a  lot better  than  reachingin  the  dark for  some numbers  that  really  don't mean anything.  Andthen  if  we don't hit  them, we explain  it  away because  of  all  thesedeviations.  In view of  that uncertainty, I would prefer  to  stay rightwhere we  are with  these  targets  but  to  get  on with  the recalculationof  some  of  these  numbers.  Unless  we  do  that,  we  won't  have  any way ofestablishing a reserve basis  for  these  items.  We are playing more  andmore an  inequitable game  in  terms  of  those  who participate  in  theconventional  forms.  It  just  behooves us  to  get  on with  the problem  ofmeasurements.  I don't  think we  have  any real  basis  for  our  shiftadjustment;  it  [involves]  numbers  that  we  had  some  time  ago  but  Idon't  think those  are  accurate.  I urge  that we  get  on with  theproblem of  a re-examination  of  these  targets.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  instead of  urging,  I would suggestthat  if  you have  some  practical  way of  going about  this,  reduce  thatto  a piece  of  paper and  tell  us.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  Yes,  I will  make an  effort.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Boykin.

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  Back  to  the  credibility problem:  In  terms  ofthe  long-term ranges,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  tentative  ranges  that  wehave published and  that  have been discussed  and seem  to be understoodon  the  outside probably  should  not be  changed at  this  point  simplybecause  I don't  think we  know  enough  to  improve  that  in  any way.  I amnot  saying  they are  the best;  I doubt that  we know what  is  the  bestright now.  But M1-B and M2  at  least as  of  midyear  seemed  to be  givingmore consistency  in  terms  of  a relationship.  Whether that  will  holdup  remains  to  be  seen.  I  think we  should hold to  [seeking]  a  gradualreduction  [of  these ranges]  over  time;  it's  a perception  that  I stillthink is  very important,  particularly to  those who  are  lesssophisticated, and we  should hold to  that.  What  is  actually going  tohappen with regard to  the  innovation  that  is  coming  is  merespeculation on  our part,  as  we  can  tell  from going  around the  tablehere.  And I agree very much with Tony Solomon that  the  time  to  makean  adjustment  is when we  have  some pretty  firm  facts  or a basis  fordoing  it  and doing  it  in  a supportable way rather  than by  conjecture.The  idea  of  giving  the  first  signal  that  this  will  be  rethought  has  alot  of  appeal  to me.  I don't  think the  fact  that  we have never made  amidyear  shift  should  [mean]  that  we never would, if  the  facts  arethere  and  a change  is  supportable.  So,  I would be  inclined to  staywhere  we  said  tentatively we were going  to  be and  let  events  unfold;and  I'd be ready  to make  adjustments  or  changes  in definitions,  orwhatever  will be  necessary,  but based on more knowledge  than  we havenow.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  It  is  not  just  a midyear  shift;  it  is  a mid-18month shift  or  any  shift  in  announced  ranges.  We  just  don't  do  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  Well, whether we do  it  at  midyear or  do  itbefore  then  or  after,  it  seems  to  me  that  it  would be  incumbent upon12/21-22/81-43-the  Committee to  reach  a judgment  and make  a determination when thefacts  support  it,  whatever point  in  time  that  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  I have  just  a couple  of  comments,  Paul.  I shareFrank's  frustration  on knowing what money  is  these  days.  He proposeda new Committee  on the  directive.  A  couple of  months  ago  I think  Ispoiled Steve's whole day by suggesting  that maybe  first  and foremostwe needed a major restudy of  the monetary aggregates.  And that  is  whyI was  so  glad  to  hear Governor Teeters  say that we  are  going  to  dosomething  about money market  funds  early  in  the year.  Could  I ask alittle more  about  that?  For  example,  Steve, we know that  some  of  theinvestment houses are  arbitrarily adding  to  observed M1-B either  10percent  or 20  percent  of  money market  funds  on  the assumption  thatsome  of  these must be  transactions  balances.  I would  like  to  ask thequestion whether  our  look-see  is  really  going to  zero  in  on whatpercentage of  these  [funds]  are  turning  over at  the  rate of  normaltransactions  balances.  I think we really need  that  kind of  studybefore we need a Committee on  the  directive, Frank.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That  is  our  hope.  In  response  to  a Boarddiscussion, we  are  in  the  initial  stages  of  outlining a one-timesurvey;  whether  it  will be  a sample or  complete  [coverage]  we are  notcertain  yet.  For  the money market  funds,  we  have  attempted todetermine  in more detail  than we now have  the various  characteristicsof  the  account:  the ownership,  size,  turnover, and  other[characteristics]  we  may think  of.  We would expect  to  have a draft  ofthe  survey  in  a  few weeks  to bring  before  the Board.  That  is  thestage where we  are  now and we hope  to  have  it  in the  field  relativelypromptly.  Whether  it  could be  done and accomplished before  thebut we  are  trying to  [meet  it].

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Steve,  I am fascinated by Willis'  observation.Can we  get  at  some  of  this  from  the clearings  [data]?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we have  data  on some  of  this  and wehave  done  some  analysis,  good or bad, that  takes  as  its  point  ofdeparture how many checks,  the value of  checks written, or  the valueof  turnover and  says:  If  that  is  representative  of  a transactionsaccount  and has  a normal  turnover of  an  individual's  checking  account,x  amount of  the money market  funds  are  like M1.  And  it  came out  toabout  a little  less  than 2 percent  the  last  time we--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It  was  4 percent, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  4 percent  of  the money market  funds,but  adding 2 percent  or a little  less  than  2 percent or  a little  lessthan 1 percent  is  a very  [unintelligible].  There are  all  kinds  ofquestions  that  can be  raised about  the methodology.  There  is  someturnover to  savings  accounts  that we  don't  put  in  at all;  there  issome  turnover  to  CDs  that we  don't  count at  all.  On  the  other hand,it makes  no  allowance  for  the  fact  that  if  somebody owns  a moneythe money  out  except  rarely,  the  fact  that  he  has  it  and knows he  canwrite  a check on it  induces  him to  hold a  lower cash balance  than hewould otherwise keep.  Now, how do we measure  that?  I think  it  is12/21-22/81-44-basically immeasurable,  and it  is  undoubtedly  there.  We have  aspectrum of  assets  and we  are  trying  to  draw  an arbitrary  line  throughit  and say  this  much  is  M1  and  that much  is  M2  or M3;  in  fact  thearbitrary line  doesn't  mean anything because  it's  a  spectrum.  Iunderstand  the  frustration.  We  ought  to know all  that we  can knowabout it;  but  in  fact we are dealing with a spectrum and  there  isn'tany answer.  Nothing  is  going to  fall  neatly into what  is  M1  and M2and M3.  We'd have  a  little trouble  if  we  sat  around this  table  tryingto rationalize  the  distinction between M2  and M3  and M3  and L.  Anysense  that  after  that  discussion we're  going  to  get a clean,conceptual difference between these Ms  I'm afraid  is  an  illusion.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  But  the  troublesome  thing  about the  moneyall  the  rest  goes against  what  all  of  us hear  that  people  are usingthese  funds  as  checking  accounts.  My own sample  indicated  that  99percent were using  them  as  checking accounts.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Well,  that's  the problem with  turnover.  Oneof  the ways  that people use  the  money market mutual  funds  is  that  theywrite  a check  at  the  end of  the  month against  them and put  it  in  theirchecking  account  and then write 20  checks  against  the  one  check.  Andif  you just  measure  turnover, you get  one check.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But  it's  a big  check  in that  case.  Theonly explanation  I have  for  the phenomenon  that  I think you correctlyobserved  is  that  it  is  a mixture.  A  large portion  of  that  isbasically savings  or  investment  in the  broader  sense.  Some  fractionof  it  is  transactions  accounts.  That  is  the  nature of  it.  M1  is  only$400  billion  and M3  is  $2  trillion or whatever  it  is.  And money

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Then what  do we  do when everything becomesmoney market  funds?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Precisely, we don't  know.  I am sayingthat  I think  it's a  little difficult,  however much study we give  this,to  say we're  going to  come up with a number  that  says  this  portion ofit  is M1  and  this  portion of  it  is  M2  because  it  doesn't  come  thatway.  It  doesn't  come  in  that kind of  package.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  It  doesn't have  to  come  into  the money marketfund.  Merrill  Lynch  lets  you draw checks  against your securities  andputs  the money into  a bank  account  that has  a money market  fundassociated with  it;  that  fund is  up  to  $12  billion now.  You  can drawa check  for  fifteen  cents.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I am not arguing at  all  over  this;obviously, we  should  get  as  much  information  about  this phenomenon  aswe can.  I just  think people are  suggesting more  than  is  practicallyfeasible to  say  that we  are going  to  have some  great  study and  somehowthe numbers  are going  to  come  fluttering down  and on  this  half  of  thetable  they are  going to  be  M1 and  on  the  other half  they are  going  tobe M2.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I couldn't  agree more,  Paul.  It  is  veryanalogous to  our difficulty in  dealing with  savings  accounts  overtime.  Savings  accounts  have more  turnover than money market  funds  and12/21-22/81-45-yet  we never put  any portion of  savings  accounts  in M1.  Indeed, wedidn't  even blink an  eye when  [depository  institutions]  went  frominterest  figured  on  the minimum balance  to  interest  from day  ofdeposit  to  day  of  withdrawal,  which was  a big  change  in  savingsaccounts.  We  never did a thing about  it.  I don't  think we have  everhandled the  notion of  savings  accounts  at  all well  in research  that  Ican recall,  extending back into  the  1950s,  in  terms  of what  to  do  withsavings  accounts  and how to  treat  their  "moneyness" in  looking atmonetary expansion.  So,  I think it  is  not  really the  turnover but[their use  as  a]  backup  that's  terribly important.  The differencebetween a money market  fund which you can have  immediate access  to  andan  IRA account which you can't draw on until you're  59-1/2  years  oldis  really phenomenal,  and yet  they  are both  in M2.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let me  just  inject a  thought  onIRAs.  Conceptually,  the  argument is  very  strong, as  I see  it,  to  takethose  out  of  M2  on  liquidity grounds.  But  suppose we went  ahead anddid that.  What we don't  know is  how much money is  going into  IRAaccounts  that  otherwise would have been  in M2  or  is  already in M2,  sowe'd get an  artificial deflation  of M2  in  an attempt  to  improve  thefigure.  In  some  long  run sense  it  probably would be  an  improvedfigure,  but  it  is  not  going  to  help us  in  1982  in  understanding M2,  Isuspect.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  You'd turn  it  into  another M1-A.

[SECTION]

MR.  CORRIGAN.  You'd have a shift-adjusted M2.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  That's  inherent  in  almost anything  welook at.  Where's  the money coming  from, right?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Right.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  It  can't  stop  us  from--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But  this  is  a reflection of  a change  inlaw.  It's  like  the M1  adjustment  problem.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  It's  so  clearly understandable byeverybody that  there's a  rationale  for  taking  it  out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm not  arguing against  taking  it  out.I'm  just  arguing against  the notion  that  it  will  give us  a cleananalytically nice  figure when we  take  it  out.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Mr.  Chairman, one more  observation:  I'd  justlike  to  remind you  that  back  in  the mid-1970s  we had one  of  theseveral  Committees  on  the directive--some  of  us  at  this  table  servedon  it--chaired first  by Bob Holland and  later by Chuck Partee.  Wetook a  long, hard  look at  optimal  control,  working on  the  ultimatevariables  and not  using money as  the  intermediate  target.  And the  netof  that was  a dry hole.  It  just  didn't prove  to  be  doable  inpractice.  So,  despite  all  of  our  frustrations  about  what money is,how  it  behaves,  and what  should be  in  M1  and M2,  it  is  still  the  onlygame  in  town as  far as  I am concerned.  Some  of  the  academics--and itis  a real  minority--are urging  us  to  target  on real  interest  rates  orto  target  on nominal  GNP.  They get  little,  if  any, support  from  theirpeers.  That  came  out  loud and  clear in  this  recent  academic12/21-22/81-46-conference  that  I mentioned yesterday.  Despite  the  frustrations  aboutthe  money supply--will  the  real  money  supply please stand up!--I  thinkit's  the  only hope we  have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  With  that  comforting  thought, Mr.  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  Taking into  account all  this  frustration,uncertainty, and credibility, which I don't  think I can add  to afterthis  dinstinguished discussion,  we  still have  to  set  some  targets  fornext  year.  I  think John  is  right  that  we still  have to  deal  withthese.  I come  down for  lowering  the  M1  range to  2-1/2  to  5-1/2percent, which is  what we  tentatively  agreed on  in July.  And  I amsympathetic  to  the notion  of  raising M2.  It  does  seem to  me  that  weought  to make  these  as  consistent as  we  can.  I don't  think  it  adds  toor  subtracts  from our credibility  if  we  make  an adjustment  in M2  tomake  it  consistent  with M1.  So,  I would favor  such an  adjustment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  just  so  we  have  everything in  front of  us,I also would like  to  point  out  that  there  is  the problem of  choosingthe  base in  doing next  year's  targeting.  We've  rather  easily slippedover  the  fact  that  there was  a considerable shortfall  in M1-B  thisyear.  In  fact,  Jerry had  an  interesting explanation  for  it--and  Ithink  it's  something we  ought  to  work on--that  involves  a  2-year  lookat  the  expansion of  M1-B.  But  there  are a good many people who  havebeen greatly  afflicted by high  interest  rates and poor business  andbankruptcy who won't  quite understand why it  is  that  we just  disregardthe  shortfall  entirely and go  on  and assign  the  same old  lower growthrate  to  M1  in  the year to  come.  I think it  is  a very serious problemthat  we have  to  deal with  in  explaining, if  that  is  what we want  todo,  why it  is  what we  want  to  do.  Most people would  say we  ought  toadd  our shortfall  in 1981  into  the  1982  expectations.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  But  last  year  didn't you  accept  thebase drift  in Ml?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  but  it  didn't  involve  bankruptcy the way  itdoes  now.  I am talking  about builders and realtors  and people  likethat who  just  aren't  going  to  understand it  and quite  a  fewCongressmen who  already have  begun to  focus on  this  issue  in  lookingat  1982.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  Chuck, what do you  do with M2,  then?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I think most people would regard M2  as  avery much lesser  target  of  policy.  That  hasn't been  the  emphasis  atall,  for a very good reason  in my view.  Of  course,  we differ on  that,but  it  is  a problem we have  to  take  into account  now.  It  happens  tobe most pointed  in this  particular  Bluebook because  in  this  Bluebookwe  have  the  sense--and  it  was  referred  to  earlier,  I think,  by Frankin a  somewhat negative way--that we  have a year  in which we've fallenprogressively short  in M1-B and we  finally got  2 or  3 months  that  areup.  October was  a normative  or maybe  a slightly more  than normativemonth;  November was a  little  strong;  and December  is  another  sort  ofnormative month.  But  choosing the  fourth quarter as  the  base meansthat  December  is  above  the  fourth-quarter average  so that  when we  ask"How are we going  to  be  on  track  for  the  first  quarter?"  we get very12/21-22/81-47-low money rate  objectives,  and  everyone notices  that.  [Growth]  isonly  1/2  or  2 percent,  depending  on which  alternative  one  takes;  thefact  is  that  it  is  very hard to  explain.  We  are  still  below  targetand now we are  talking  about getting  down  to  the  new  target  in  thisvery meeting,  in  the  second part  of  this meeting  that we  are  going tohave.  It  seems  to  me  that's a very  [unintelligible]  representation ofthe problem we have.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Chuck, doesn't  the  law say  that we have  to  use  thefourth quarter as  a  [base]?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  No,  the  law doesn't  say  that.  It  says  the year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I would observe  in  this  connection  that  Ilike  to  look at  a somewhat longer  perspective than these  fourth-quarter  [measures].  This  doesn't  deal  with the  short-run problem ofwhat  to  do when we have a sudden  increase  such  as  we have  now.  We endup  with a high December  and all  the rest.  But  on  an annual  basis  thetable  on page  6  [of  the Bluebook]  in  a sense  is  another way of  lookingat  what  Jerry Corrigan was  looking  at;  it  overlaps,  anyway.  If  youlook at  these  annual  [growth  rates]  year over  year, which are  thenumber  2  figures here,  [for M1-B]  it's  8.2 percent  in  '78,  downslightly  in  '79,  down more  in  '80,  and down more  in  '81.  It's  afairly smooth pattern, though you can  argue  that  it's  too much,  toolittle,  or whatever.  But  it  doesn't  give  that  extreme movement we  getwith the  fourth quarter  figures because  that  reflects  the  obvious;  infact we  started high this  year and ended up  low  [given]  the decliningtrend during  the  year.  Last year we  did the  opposite.  When youaverage  through the  12  months you  get  a reasonably smooth pattern.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  if we  wanted to  take  that  4-1/2  percent[year-over-year  growth]  for  '81  and have,  say,  4 percent  for  '82  forthe  annual  average,  I think we'd  find  that  the  quarterly growth ratewould have  to be  quite a bit more  than that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Steve  has  done  that  calculation.  If  Iunderstand it  correctly, if  we  stayed exactly  on  the  target  quarter byquarter  at  the  4 percent midpoint  of  this  tentative  range, the  annualaverage  also  comes  out  to  4 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  it's  tricky because  that's  the  actual M1not shift-adjusted over  last year's  regular M1,  so  it  works outfortuitously  that way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But what's  the meaning of  that?  It  comesout  considerably higher  if  you measure  the actual  M1  in  '82  over theshift-adjusted in  '81.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  No,  in  '81  the year over  year not  shift-adjusted so-called M1  grew  [6.9]  percent,  so  we would get  that  goingdown to  4.0  percent.  And the  shift-adjusted M1  grew  4-1/2  percent,and we  get  that  going down  to  4.0  percent.  So we  really  are getting  ayear-over-year drop.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm not  sure  I fully understand how wecome  out  on  the number  2 basis but any way we do  it  I take  it  that  if12/21-22/81-48-we  stayed  on path, we'd come  out  with another drop  year  over year  onthis  tentative  target.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  If  it was  exactly a  4 percent  increase month bymonth after  the  first  quarter,  with a  little  slower  growth  in  thefirst  quarter,  it  would come  out  at  4 percent on  this  measure.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I wonder  if  anybody has noticed how beautifullywe have come out by way of  the performance  of  nominal  GNP  in  terms  ofchanges.  Starting  from  1979  it  shows  9.9  to  9.4  to  9.1  to  8.6percent.  Now, that  is  about as  good a  target  for  nominal  GNP as  onecan possibly  imagine--fortuitous, but  very well balanced.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Where  am  I here?  Has  everybody said  allthey want  to  say on  this  particular  subject?  I am not  sure  I heard anenormous  range  of  opinion on  the  targets  themselves.  There  is  somedisagreement  about what  to  do with M2.  I have  a great  deal  ofsympathy with  the  subject  that  Frank particularly emphasized andothers have  too.  I must  say I have  a great  deal  of  sympathy with  thefrustrations  in  defining  the numbers  and knowing what  they mean.  Idon't extend my sympathy  to a great  antipathy about  or not  worryingabout  interest rates.  I think that  is  the  obvious modification  thatone might  introduce  into our procedures  in the  absence  of  some magicalother statistic.  I think we have had  a problem with  interest rates.If  anything, we probably should have paid more  attention to  themrather  than  less,  I'd say.  That's  a personal  reaction  anyway.  Itcertainly  is  not driving  me back  to  being more precise  about numbersthat  I don't  understand.Let me  give you the  nature of  the problem that  I  see  in  M1.  Ithink some  day, conceptually,  if  we  didn't  have any  statisticalproblems,  this  demand  shift  that  we  keep  talking  about might  go  inreverse.  If  people had more confidence  in the  currency and  lowerinterest rates  and we  got  interest  rates paid on  transactions  accountsthat  would be by  regulation or  in practice much closer  to marketrates,  we might  find some  day that  we  had  to have a decidedly  fastergrowth of  M1  relative  to  nominal  increases  in  GNP  or other magnitudes.I don't  think we  are  there  yet.  But  some  day that  is  going to  happen.Apart  from that,  what  do we say about  M1  next year?  I could see  itrepeating  [this  year's experience]  as  some people have  said, but  itcould go  either  way so  far as  I know, for purely  institutionalreasons.  If  interest  rates  continue  to  decline,  if  the  economy weresomewhat  on  the  soft,  depressed side,  if  the  ceiling rates  go up  ontransaction-type accounts,  we might  get  a big expansion  in M1  relativeto what we  otherwise would contemplate  or  relative  to  past patternsbecause  of  money flows,  particularly  into NOW accounts,  that  otherwisemight  have  been  lodged elsewhere.  [That  assumes]  we don't  get  theaggressive competition  from money market  funds,  we have a  [markedlyupward  sloping]  yield curve,  and  short-term rates  are  getting downtoward what  institutions  can pay.  On  the  other hand,  if  interestrates  remain relatively  high, which might  occur with a fairly  strongeconomy relative  to  projections, we  could get  a great  spread  of  sweepsinto  money market  fund accounts,  with practically  every bank  in thecountry offering  that  service.  M1  could get  very depressed relativeto  other  economic magnitudes.  I don't  know which way  it  will  go.12/21-22/81-49-We all  want  to  be very precise about  the  money supply targetand that's  fine.  The effectiveness  of  that  target may be  more alteredby a decision  that  we  have to  make as  to  whether we  are  going topermit sweeping  of  accounts  or not  than by  the decision we make as  towhere to put  the precise target.  We  have  to  face  that decision, whichwill be a very difficult one.  But  I think we probably will have  quitea different  situation if  there  is  no  sweeping than  if  this  [practice]catches  on like  wildfire.  There was  something in  the paper thismorning about  the Fidelity  fund being all  set up  to do  this with  alarge group  of  Midwestern banks.  I don't  know what  the  implicationsof  that will be but  I suspect  things will be  different whether it'spermitted to  take place  or  not to  take  place.  I have a rather strongbias under these  circumstances not  to be  more precise than we reallycan be  in  setting the  targets  and not  to  put all  the weight  on  onemonetary aggregate either because I find  it very useful  to  look atmore  than one, whatever we  say about  the  targets,  in  trying  tounderstand what  is  going on  in  these very complex and difficultcircumstances  in which we  live.On  the  substantive  side, where  I think greater problems  lie,we  may have an  insoluble problem.  It  is  not  impossible  and may evenbe  likely, apart  from  the  short-run question,  that we will  have  theimmediate problem of  a recession  and not  want to  aggravate  that  andwant  to  facilitate  recovery  and all  the  rest.  In  that process,  Idon't  think we  can  forget  about what happens when the economy turnsaround and begins  to  rise again.  If  it does,  we will  just  run  intoanother blank wall  on  sharply rising interest rates--with precipitousincreases  in money market  rates and long-term rates,  not  justreflecting what  is  going on but  in anticipation of  budgetary deficitsand economic  recovery and restrictive monetary policy--and  I'm notsure we will  have  served the  country well.  We have  to  think a bitabout  strategies  to minimize  that possibility;  we  can't  eliminate  it.The  reason the problem may be  insoluble is  that  the only way we arereally going  to  deal with  this,  I suspect,  apart  from the budgetaryconsideration,  is  to  convince people  that we  have a hold on inflationand have created a climate  in  which interest  rates,  particularly long-term rates,  will  tend to  go down.  But  how do we  create  that  climateand that  expectation without  in some  sense risking being overly tightin  the  short  run?  And because people  are  so  skeptical  about  whetherthat  is  going  to  happen, the  long-term rates  won't come  down  fastenough to  facilitate  the  recovery we  want.  To what  degree can weovercome  that by being  "easier" in  terms  of  the money supply?  Maybethat will  scare people even more and work against  the objective  ofcreating a climate  in which  interest rates  aren't going  to bounce upagain  as  soon  as  the  economy turns  around.  I am not entirelydiscouraged about  this  because I think, particularly starting where weare with  interest  rates  so high,  there  is  a possibility  thatconfidence will  return more  rapidly than we could  imagine now.  So  wecould get a situation where  the economy could turn around consistentwith declines  in interest  rates,  if we  can get  the  economy turnedaround at  all.  But  I think  that  is  the  chance we have  to  play for.Well,  I don't know  that we  are  going to  be  all  that far  apartin the  mechanics.  On  this  question that  Governor  Partee  raised, wecould broaden  that a little  as  to  whether  there is  any better way ofpresenting our targets.  How we deal with base drift  is  one aspect  ofthat.  I don't have  any brilliant  suggestions but  it may be worth alittle  further  thought.  We have  to  deal  with this  immediate problem12/21-22/81-50-in  setting  the  short-run target.  I don't  know that  we  can go  anyfurther  on  the  discussion of  the  long  run.  This  has  been useful  insome ways.  We will  obviously return  to  it  and will have  to  resolve  itin  early  February.  Why don't you present  the  short-term issues,Steve,  and  then we'll  have  a coffee break.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  If  I might  take  a minute before  I do  that,  Idid look up  the answer  to  the  question  that  President  Morris  raised ofwhether we have  ever had rapid growth  in M1,  such  as  the  4-1/2 percentrate  of  growth we  are having  in  the  fourth quarter, with a markedquarter  at a  5-1/2  percent rate.  There  are a  surprising number ofquarters of  negative  growth in  the  economy and positive  growth  inmoney--I  am talking  about  on a quarterly average basis.  There  wereeven quarters  where we had a deceleration  and then  an  acceleration  ofmoney, surprisingly enough.  For  example,  in  the  second quarter  of1979  real GNP  was  [minus]  1-3/4 percent  after being plus  [3.9]  percentin  the  first  quarter,  and money growth went  from  5-1/2  in  the  firstquarter  to  10  percent  in the  second quarter.  Similarly,  in  the  thefirst  quarter  of  '74 real  GNP had  dropped at  around a  4 percent  annualrate  after  rising at  a  3-1/4 percent  rate  in the  fourth  quarter of'73,  and money growth  accelerated  from  4.8  to  6.7  percent.  So  it  isnot  an  extremely infrequent  occurrence  that  something  like  thathappens  and,  of  course,  we  are aiming  at  it  this  time.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Money is  supposed to  lead  the  economy with along and variable  lag.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  This  is  only quarter  to  quarter.  I didn'ttrace  out  the  averages.  I was  just  responding  to  the question.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  The  examples you gave were  all  relativelyrecent.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  But  it's  even  the  case  going back.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  I wonder,  Steve, if  you  compared  the quarterlyrate  of money growth  to  the  trend rate,  if  there  is  any  instance wherewe  had two  quarters  of  M1-B growth falling  below the  trend rate wherewe haven't had a  significant  downturn in  economic  activity.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  that  is  a different  question.  I was  justresponding  to  the  question  that  President Morris  raised  of whetherwithin a quarter  we had had  this kind of movement.  Our  observation  isthat  it's  not  as  rare  as  one might have  thought  it  would be.Mr.  Chairman, we designed  the  short-run  alternatives on  thebasis  of  the  tentative  range  of  2-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent  that  theCommittee had set  for  M1-B and on  the  basis  of  the Committee'sprevious practice  of,  in  effect,  shifting  the  base  to  the  actual  levelof  money.  Alternative A was  designed to  hit  the  upper  end of  that2-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent range,  alternative  C to hit  the  lower  end, andalternative  B to be  in between by March.  It  is  a fairly mechanicalsetting  of  the  ranges.  Thus,  from the  fourth-quarter average  that  wesuggested  as  a base,  the  growth rate  for  alternative A  is  5-1/2percent,  the  upper  end  of  the  range.  That  [took  account  of]  how theCommittee has  set  short-run ranges before.  Our  thought was  that12/21-22/81-51-number yet.  If  it  did come  out  as  we  are projecting,  the  impliedgrowth rates  are  so  low  that  they  raise  the possibility of  beingsubject  to  some misinterpretation when put  out  in  the  directive.  Analternative way of  doing it  would be  to  make  the  base November, whichthe  Committee has  done  before,  and the growth rates  for  alternativesA,  B,  and C would be  about  0.3  lower.  That  is,  the  5-1/2  percent withrange;  and  that  0.3  would  extend across  all  of  the  other alternatives.That,  as  I say, the  Committee  has done  one  time before.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  That would be  November-to-March then,  Steve?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  With  regard to  the  implications of  thesealternatives  for credit markets  (and assuming less  of  a demand shift,so  to  speak, than  took place  in  1981)  our  analysis  suggested that  theodds were--unless  the  economy was  considerably weaker  than  is  beingprojected--that  there would  be not much  room for  further  interest ratemodest growth  in money consistent with  the  Committee's  long-run range.Under alternative  A it  looked to us  as  if  there was  more  of  apossibility for  declines  in interest  rates  given the  GNP projection.So,  in  a sense,  one way  of  putting  it  is  that  the  Committee's  choicewould be  to  set  a target  depending on how  it  tends  to  lean  in  itsattitude  toward credit markets  at  this  time, before  the recovery hasstarted.  To  the  degree  that  the  Committee wishes  to  give  a littleimpetus  to  easing in  credit  markets  in order  to  encourage  therecovery,  that  tends  to  argue,  of  course,  for the  more  liberal  [fourthquarter  to  March]  alternative within  the  Committee's  range.  To  thedegree  that the  Committee  would want  to  leave more  room for  expansionlater  and believes the  recovery has  enough momentum and can  turnaround on  its  own, that  tends  to  argue  for  an  alternative  of  lowergrowth,  leaving a little more  room later  to  finance  the  expansion asit  develops.I should mention one  other point, Mr. Chairman, with  regardto  the borrowing assumption.  We  have  assumed borrowing in  alternativeB of around $450  million, which  is  a little higher  than we haveactually attained in  recent weeks.  Again,  to  the  degree  that  theCommittee wants  to  lean  toward a little easing  in  credit markets  insetting its  monetary target,  consideration could be given  to  loweringthat more  toward  the  levels  of  borrowing  that  are suggested  foralternative A, which would be  around  $250 million.  That  leaves  arange,  obviously,  in between.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me make  a couple of quick commentsjust  in terms  of  presentation.  I am not  crazy about  that  firstalternative  in  the  Bluebook,  [shifting  the  base]  from  a quarterlyaverage to  a monthly number.  That  looks  a  little awkward  to me and  Irecoil  a bit.  I don't  like  the  December-to-March approachparticularly because we  don't yet  know December.  It  seems  to me wehave  done  that before and then  gotten mixed up by the  fact  thatin  the way we  expected.  This  leaves me  thinking  that maybe  theis  just  arithmetic  in presentation.On  the  substance,  I find myself  thinking these  numbers  meansomething quite  different  if  in  fact we  continue  to  get  sizable growth12/21-22/81-52-because NOW accounts  are  bulging--and we  don't quite  know why but  itthan  if  NOW accounts  are not  bulging  the way  they have been in  thelast  few weeks.  I guess  that's  all  I have in  the way of  preliminarycomments.  Why don't we  have  coffee.[Coffee  break]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me make  one  other comment  just  to  setthe  stage  for what we're  talking about  and  to  give  us  a due  sense  ofhumility.  If  I recall  the  discussion correctly at  the  last meeting,  Idon't  think  anybody around the  table--I  certainly speak  for  myself--had any conviction  that,  almost  regardless  of  what  we did, we  weregoing to  have high money supply  figures  in the  period from the  lastmeeting  to  this  meeting.  Everybody was worried that  whatever  numberwe  put  down we might  fall  way short  even  if  interest  rates declined.Instead, we had interest  rates  tending  to be under  a little  morepressure  in  the money market  and  the money supply  figures  movingsignificantly  in excess  of  the  target we put  down.  I don't  think  thatis  a  tragedy.  I am  just  saying  that  is  an indication of  the  [limited]degree  of precision  that  we have  in setting  the  target  for  a  one-monthperiod;  whatever effects  there  will  be  on  the money supply  in  the nextmonth  are probably already  [determined]  in  the market,  rather  than bywhat we  do  today.  But  we  are  setting a money supply  target  here for  aquarter.  Let's proceed with  the discussion.  Is  there a  generalagreement  that  we  ought  to  use November  as  a presentational base?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  may  just make  it  a bit  less  confusingif  we--numbers?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Paul,  how would that  influence  the money growth

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it's  just  what Steve  said.  Ifyou're  looking at  the  fourth quarter-to-March numbers,  take  off  0.3  toget the  equivalent number  on M1.  I don't  know what  it  does--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  On M2  the numbers  are 9.8,  8.9,  and8.1  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Those  are  the equivalent numbers?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Those  are  the  equivalent  numbersaccording  to  our  calculations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me  just write  those  down.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Say  them  again.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Taking the  November base  to  March,for  alternative A M2  is  9.8  percent, alternative B  is  8.9  percent,  andalternative C is  8.1  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  How about  M1?12/21-22/81-53-

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  M1,  as  Steve  said,  is  5.2,  3.7,  and2.2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Solomon.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  What  I would recommend, Mr.  Chairman,is  taking  the November  base and  liberalizing alternative B somewhat  byrounding up  the  3.7  to  4 percent.  I'd start  with  around $350  millionof  initial borrowing and lower  the  fed funds  rate  range by 1 point,which would bring it  down  to  10  to  14  percent  or we could use  10  to15  percent  if  we  want  to  go back  to  the  5-point  spread.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Tony,  the  4 percent  is  the  quarterly average?Is  that  what you're  explaining?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  it's November  to March.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Which is  a  liberalization  of  "B."

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  You're  saying make  the  fed  funds  range  10  to  15percent,  Tony?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Or  10  to  14  percent.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Either 10  to  14  or  10  to  15  percent,I don't  care.  There's  some  advantage  in  changing  that range  from timeto  time  whether  it's  4 points  or  5 points.  I don't  feel  stronglyabout  that.  But  I do  think the  lower end of  it  ought  to  be  lowered by1 point  and  that  the  initial  borrowing ought  to  be  around $350million.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Sounds  like  a Solomonic  judgment!

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I'll vote  for  that.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  What  was your M2  number?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Well,  the M2  number then becomesaround  9 percent.  It's  8.9 percent  technically, but  if  we round upthe  3.7  on M1-B  to  4 percent  then  it  would be  shading M2  to  a littlemore  than  9 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Gramley.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I'd  like  to  say first  that  I don't  thinkanything we do here  today is  going  to  help  this  recession come  to  anend soon.  It's going  to  run  its  course  for a while.  I do believethat  if  we  are  not  careful  in  the  selection of  where we  go, we  coulddraw out  the  recession  and make  it  longer.  Therefore,  I want  to  avoidany alternative  that would result  in  rising  interest rates  at  thisstage.  I think  that would be  a grave  mistake.  What we  ought  to  beaiming  for  is  to  set  the  stage  for  a recovery later this  spring butone  of  moderate dimensions.  We  ought  to be  very careful  to  avoid thekind  of problems we  got  into  in  1980.  I'm  cognizant of  the  enormous12/21-22/81-54-uncertainties  we  face  in  interpreting  the monetary aggregates,  notonly  in  the  long run because  of  these  tremendous  innovational  changesbut  also  the point  you made  earlier, Mr.  Chairman,  that  we havesomething  going on  here  in the  OCD  area  that  we  ought  to be  awfullycareful  with.  I would opt  for  alternative  B.  I could  live with  asomewhat  lower borrowing  level,  but  $450  million  or  $400  to  $450million  is  acceptable.  I would say, however,  that  in  addition  toadopting the  specs  of  "B" for  growth rates  of  M1  and M2  we  ought  to  bewilling  to  live  with  a larger  increase  in M1-B if  it  results  from  thekind of  increase  in OCDs we've been  seeing  recently, which we have  areasonable basis  for  interpreting.  This parking of  funds while  thereis  uncertainty  is  clear.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Just  as  a matter  of clarification, whenyou  say  "B,"  are  you willing to  accept  something  like  Mr.  Solomon's[numbers]?

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes,  that's  all  right;  I would go with that.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  You  know that  when we  set  something  and accepta higher amount  that  it  has  the  effect,  really,  of pegging  the  fundsrate.  Is  that  what you  want?

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I tried not  to  use--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  He  doesn't want  interest  rates  to  go up.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Well,  I think  there's  a  difference ofview among  the  technical  people  as  to  whether initial  borrowing of$350  million means  a  lower  rate  or  the  same  rate as  we've been  seeinglately.  Borrowings  have  been running  on  average  less  than the  $450million.  We might  ask both  Steve  and Peter  to  comment  on what  theythink the  implications  are.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  We've  assumed in  the  Bluebook  that  if  the  pathwere  $450  million and  it was  successfully hit,  probably  there would besome  little upward  tick  in the  funds  rate,  but maybe not  a lot.  Iwould assume  that  $350  million at  a minimum would probably avoid  that;whether  that would  cause  the  funds  rate  to  drop  initially, I  feel  moreagnostic  about.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  I wouldn't  disagree with  that.  I would  tendto  think of  something  like  $250 million  of  borrowing  as  perhaps  likelyto  keep  the  funds  rate  just  around the  discount rate,  $350  million

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  To what  extent  does  the  discount  rate  act  as  afloor?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  The discount  rate  becomes  a  kind of  anchoraround which  the  funds  rate  clusters  once  there's  enough borrowing tomake  that  discount  rate meaningful.  If  there's  so  little  borrowingthat  a great majority  of  banks  hardly ever  [come  to]  the discountwindow,  then  the discount  rate  isn't  too meaningful  and we  fall  intothis  zone  of  indeterminacy.  I don't know whether  it's  $200  or  $250million  or what, but  once  there's  something  like  that  level  ofborrowing then  there will  be  enough  borrowing so  that  the  discount12/21-22/81-55-window  is  a meaningful alternative  that  a number  of  banks  want  toavoid;  they will  be willing  to  pay the  rate  in  the  funds market  ratherthan  come  to  the  window.  And  the more of  that  borrowing gap  there  is,the more demand for  funds  there will be by  banks  that want  to  stayaway from  the  window;  so,  they'd be willing  to  pay up a  little  higherin  order to  stay away  [from the window].

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Mr. Chairman,  I find very little to  disagree  within  either Lyle's  or  Tony's  statement, and since  it  sounds  a littlepoetic  I'll  say  that  I'll  just  go with  the  wisdom  of  Solomon.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Ford.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  I want  everybody to  know  that  I am  the  one whofirst  said  that  I don't  think  anybody here  is  wise  enough  to  determineinterest  rates  except  Solomon!  I, too,  tend  to  agree with  him.  Thisis  getting  to  be  easy except  that  I'd  like  to  reinforce  one point hemade  and that  relates  to  the  fed  funds  rate  range.  If  I read theGreenbook  forecast correctly,  the  staff  is  saying that  in  the  firstquarter of  next  year we're going  to  have a negative  GNP  of  2.2percent,  a GNP deflator of  under  7 percent,  and unemploymentapproaching 9 percent.  And with  a GNP deflator  that  low, other  priceindexes are probably going  to  be down.  We're  talking about  realinterest  rates  on  average  in  those  three  alternatives  of  5 percent  on"A,"  6 percent  on  "B,"  and 7 percent  on  "C." least  allow the possibility of  seeing  [real]  interest rates  get  intothe  single digit range  at  the  nadir of  this deep  recession.  So,  I'dargue  for  "B" with  a wider  fed  funds  range, maybe going  from  [a  lowerlimit  of]  9 percent  and centering on  the present  rate, which  Iunderstand is  just  over 12  percent.I think we  should at

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Corrigan.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  I am comfortable with  Mr.  Solomon's variationof  "B,"  although I'd  like  to  think  of  the  initial borrowing as  morelike  $400  million or maybe a bit higher rather  than  the  $350  millionthat Tony suggested just  because I'd  still  like  to  leave a  little roomdown  the  road.  But,  basically, I'd go along with something like  Mr.Solomon's  suggestion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Partee.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I have  no difficulty with the  funds  rangethat you specified Tony, of  10  to  14  percent.  We're right about  atthe midpoint  of  it  now and that  assumes  that  it  might  drift a  littlelower but  not very much, at  least  initially.  I don't know but  I thinkeither  $350  or $400  million on borrowing would be  all  right.  I'dcertainly accept  the  $350  million.  I do  think  that your objectivesfor M1  and M2  are pretty stingy.  Page  2 of  the  Bluebook shows  aNow, that  has benefitted some  from  the  shift  adjustment;  that  is,  Idon't have an M1  figure here.  But  if  it  weren't  shift-adjusted,  itwould be  somewhat higher  than that--7-1/2  percent  or something  likethat.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  are you looking  at?12/21-22/81-56

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I am  looking at page 2;  I can't  work with  thesealternatives  which don't have  the  correct  figures  on  that.  So  I amtrying  to  look  at  what  experience  has been recently as  against whatwe're plotting  for  the  period ahead.  It  shows an  increase  fromlittle--and that  goes  into  our numbers  that  we're  calculating  lookingahead as  maybe  something  like  7-1/2  percent  in M1  as  newly defined and12-1/2  percent  in M2.  You are  cutting those  to  4 and  9 percent.That's a pretty  sharp cut  in  the  growth rate  compared with what wehave  been experiencing  recently.  And I  think that's  too  abrupt.  Iwould prefer  an M1  of  5 percent  and an M2  of  10  percent  as  a  centerpoint  for November  to  March.  I don't  think  anybody would be  surprisedat  that  or  regard  it  as  being unduly expansive;  in  fact  they mightregard it  as  being pretty restrictive  compared with recent  experienceand  [given]  the  shortfall we've  had.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  What  was your M1,  Chuck?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Five.  I am just picking  it  almost  out  of  theair but  a 5 percent M1  seems  to  me  like  a normative M1;  and  if  we  took5 percent and 10  percent  for  the  two  numbers,  that's  really quite  abit  less  [growth]  than we've had recently  in  both M1  and M2.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Well,  if  we have  a big December;  this  is  a

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That will  mean  even less  in  the  course  [of  the4-month period];  and we'll  review it  again  in early February.  Theother  thing I'd  just  comment  on  is  that  I don't know what  to make  ofthose NOW accounts.  I'm  inclined  to  think  it  is  an error  in  theseasonal  adjustment  but  I am not  sure.  It  could be that  there  is  abig build-up  in precautionary balances  in NOW accounts,  as  the  staffsays,  and  that might  well  continue  right  on  through  the  winter if  thatis  the case.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Well,  it  might  be  temporary parkingfor  Christmas.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  that's  right.  And that  is  why I  think[the  explanation]  may be the  seasonal.  The  seasonal doesn't  have  theadvantage of  knowing what  those household accounts  have done  in pastyears.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  Or  a temporary parking for  IRA-Keoghs.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Or  just  temporary parking because people  arescared  they may  lose  their  jobs.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  That  is  right.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  You  know, it  makes a difference.  I  think  Lyleis  right  that  we want  to watch that  carefully to  see whether  [NOWaccounts]  continue  to  be  the  source  of  strength  in M1  and regard thata  little  differently than  if  it  is  in corporate balances  or  intraditional demand accounts where one might  think  that a build-upwould be a predecessor,  as  Larry likes  to  say, to  an  expansion  inactivity, which  also  could  be the  case.  We might  be right  on the  edgeof  a recovery in  the  economy and not  know it.  But  it  is  just not12/21-22/81-57-clear  to me  which is  the  case.  Nevertheless,  my basic point  is  that  4and 9 percent  are  so  far below what we  recently have had  that  they  aretoo  low to  shoot  for,  and  I would  rather have  5 and 10  percent  butwith your parameters  on  the  funds  rate  and initial  borrowings,  Tony.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I'd prefer  something between  "A" and  "B,"  and Ican't get  excited whether  it's  Tony's  or Chuck's  [formulation].  I dohave  stronger  feelings  about  the  funds  range;  I think it  ought  to  be10  to  14  percent.  I would  look with considerable  disfavor if  thefunds  rate  rose;  I could accept  some  decline.  And somewhere betweenthe  $350  and  $400  million range on borrowings makes  sense.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Generally I come  out  in favor  of  "B+,"  abouthalfway between  those  two  revised numbers,  starting with November  [asthe base].  I share the  concern  that  Lyle and some  others  haveexpressed that  this  recession might be worse  than the  staff  is  nowforecasting.  If  there  is  an  error,  it  is  likely to  be  on  the  side  ofthe recession being deeper  through the  first  quarter  than both  ourstaff  and the  Board's  staff have  suggested.  And  for  that  reason Iwould agree with Bill  Ford on  the  federal  funds  rate  range.  I'dprefer  to  see  the bottom of  it  as  low  as  9 percent, and  I would notlike  to  see us  strongly resist  the decline  in  interest  rates  thatwould accompany a really soft  economy.  So  I'd accept  either  9 to  14or 9 to  15  percent  on  the  funds  rate  range.  And as  far as  theborrowing assumption is  concerned, $350  to  $400  million would be  okaywith me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  I find myself  leaning  toward  the  easyside  this  time because  what we  have done  is  to  avoid following  theaggregates  as  far  as we might;  had we  done so,  interest rates would bea  lot  lower.  Not having done  that,  I think we ought  to  give  theeconomy  a chance  to  recover at  this  interest  rate  level  and try tostring  that  [level]  out as  long  as  it  will  last,  giving  [firms]  achance  to  issue more  bonds  and so  on.  I would not welcome a  furtherdrop  unless  the economy weakens  substantially because  that  wouldsimply be  what  I think has been  the  error that  we have  avoided in  thefirst place.  But we  have  to  compensate somewhat  for not having  letrates  drop  that  far by now smoothing  them out  for  the  future.  So,  Iwould go with  the higher aggregate  [growth rates]  proposed--that  is  M1at  5 percent  and M2 at  10  percent, a  low borrowing assumption of  $250or  $300  million, and a  funds rate  range  of  10  to  14  percent.  Iwouldn't  see  any advantage  in  letting  fed funds  get  into  the  single-digit range;  I'd  try to  hold  it here  for a while  if  circumstancespermit.  There  is  a cost  to  this;  later  in  the  year we may have  toaccept  higher  interest rates  to  stick by our  overall  targets.  Thatcost  I think we  have  to be prepared to  pay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR.  KEEHN.  I'd be  comfortable with Mr.  Solomon's proposalfor both M1  and M2,  given the  current  state  of  the economy, with thethought  that  a little  reduction in  the  fed  funds  rate  might provide12/21-22/81-58-some  encouragement.  I'd be  in  favor  of  a $350  to  $400  millionborrowing range  and  a federal  funds  target  range  of  10  to  14  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I'd be comfortable  with Mr.  Solomon's proposalwith  one exception.  It  is  maybe  a fence-riding caveat.  I amconcerned  about  interest  rates  rising and,  to  ensure  against  that,  Iwould  like  to  suggest  that we  adopt  the  modified  "B" as  Tony hassuggested, with $400  million borrowing but  by the  same  token  have  anunderstanding that  if  money in January begins  to  come  in a bitstronger  than projected, there  wouldn't be any overt  action  taken  thatwould result  in higher  interest  rates until  we  got  to  [M1  growth]  atabout  the  "A" level.  In  other words,  we'd have a range,  if  you will,of  4  to  5 percent M1  growth under  that  kind  of proposal  before  theDesk would alter  the path  that  was  set  based upon a November base.Also I'd  favor a  federal  funds  range of  10  to  14  percent,  whichprovides  a bit  of  insurance that  we  would have a  consultation  if  thefunds  rate begins  to  rise  early  in  the period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Teeters.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Well,  I can endorse Tony's  suggestion,  whichwas  modified by Roger,  Chuck, and others.  If  you look  at  it  visually,we need something more  than 4 percent  [M1  growth]  to  come  in  ontarget.  So,  if  we  take  Roger's  suggestion  of  4 percent  for  M1  and use9 percent  for M2,  a  funds  range of  10  to  14  percent,  and borrowing of$350  million with  the understanding  that  if  M1  growth begins  to  go upwe won't  try to  restrain  it  if  it  means  a  rise  in  interest  rates,  thatwould be  a perfectly acceptable decision  for me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I am not  quite  sure  about one  comment youmade.  What you  are  suggesting is  low relative  to  the  targets,  as  Iunderstand this,  because  if  you  are  talking about next year's  target,it  is  right on  it.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  No,  I am  talking  about Chuck's  point  that bygoing from November  to March we have  a December which  is probablygoing  to be above November and we  have a high first  month in  there  sowe may need a  little  leeway  to  accommodate  for  the  fact  that  Decemberis  coming  in  above  the November  level.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  If  you  look  specifically at  the  staff's numberson page 12  for  M1  under  alternative B, which  is  about what Tony had  inmind, that  calls  for  a December of  8 percent  and  then a January and

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.  Well,  that's  reflected  in  the  secondpart  of  page  11.

MR. ROOS.  As  a means of  achieving growth  in  M1 next  year  of5 percent,  for  the  reasons  I attempted  to  enunciate yesterday, I wouldfavor  the alternative A  choice.  I wouldn't  jump  off  the bridge  if  youadopted Tony  Solomon's  "B+;"  I would be  happier  on Christmas  Eve  if  wedid widen  that  funds  range  a  little, maybe  to  9 to  14  percent orsomething  like  that.  A  $350  to  $400  million borrowing assumptionwould be  consistent with  this,  I think.

MR.  PARTEE.  I want  to  be  associated with those  remarks  andI'd  like  to  join Governor Wallich,  too.

MR. RICE.  I would say 5 percent  for  M1  and 10  percent  forM2,  borrowing of,  say,  $350  million,  and on  the  funds  range  10  to  14percent.

MR. FORD.  I didn't  hear that.  Could somebody repeat  it?

MR. FORD.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  I would  take  to  heart your  caution  that we betterlook down  the  road in  terms  of  the  short-term target  as  well  as  justthe immediate  problem.  And  I would go along with the  4 and 9 percenton  the aggregates  because they're  in  line with our  longer-rangetargets.  [For  the  funds  range]  10  to  14  percent  is  fine.  On  theother  hand, if  the aggregates  should come  in  stronger,  a  littleincrease  in  the rates,  not  a major one,  would not bother me as  awarning in  terms  of what  lies  ahead.  So,  I would not be  upset,  if  theaggregates were  strong,  to  see  a little  firming  in rates  as  a warningto what  the  fall  may hold  for us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  have  a few precincts that  haven't beenheard  from.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Well,  I'll  do  it  quickly.  The  $350  million andthe 10  to  14  percent  I think  are  fine.  I prefer  4 and 9 percent  [forthe aggregates]  because  I don't believe  we're going  to have  a greatdeal  of  problem with that.  My  feeling  is  that  there's  a risk  in  theeconomy  that  tends  to  be  on  the down  side and  I just don't  understandthe  OCDs.  I don't know, but my gut  feeling  is  that  [the  recession]  isnot going to  continue  forever,  so  I don't  feel  that  we  are going  tohave much of  a problem.  On  the other  hand, if  we do have  some12/21-22/81-60-problem,  I wouldn't mind  seeing us  have  a little  leeway  on  the up  sidethere.  I am perfectly willing  to  tolerate  a  little  stronger growthdepending  upon what  happens  in  the  economy and what happens  tointerest  rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm  ahead of  the  Secretary.  I guesseverybody has  been heard from.  We obviously don't  have  any very bigdifferences here.  Where has borrowing been in  the  last  three weeks?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I'll  give  you  the  precise numbers  in  just  asecond.  It  has  been  running about  $340  million  this  week so  far  andthat  would be about  the  average.  For  the week  of  the  16th  it was  $268million;  for  the  9th,  $493  million;  for  the 2nd,  $192  million;  andbefore  that,  $214  million.  [For  that  period]  we were  expectingborrowing  of  $400  million or  higher.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Wasn't  this  partly a consequence  of  very littledemand  for  excess  reserves?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  initially.  But excess  reserves wererevised upward successively as  the weeks  passed.  They ran  a littlelow  in two  out  of  the  first  three weeks  and were very high in  one ofthem,  so  they  averaged  [close  to  expectations]  in the  first  threeweeks  and  then were  very low  last week.  Last week  [excess]  wasnegative;  I don't  how it's  coming out  this  week.  It  didn't  turn outto  be  nearly as  low as  it  looked at  the  beginning because we got  "as-of"  adjustments  subsequently.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I only have  some very  limited  substantivecomments  to  add to  what has been  said.  A premise of  a  lot  of  thecomments  was  that  nobody's dying to  see  interest  rates rise  at  thispoint.  And there's  a certain  sense that  people  would feel  a  littlemore comfortable with a decline,  I  suppose,  if  I can summarize  theatmosphere.  In  that  connection a number  of people  commented  that  they12/21-22/81-61-are not  going  to be  upset by a slightly higher growth rate  in  theaggregates.  Nobody mentioned  the  opposite, which  I would now mention.If  interest rates  really softened,  I wouldn't be  all  that  disturbedabout  some  shortfall  from any of  these numbers  we are  talking  aboutif,  and I emphasize  this,  interest rates  were  declining  in any verypronounced way during  this particular period.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  What  if  the decline  in  the  real  economy  in thefirst  quarter continues  at  the  rate  in  the  fourth quarter?  [Interestrates]  undoubtedly would be  softer.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it  didn't happen  in  the  last part  ofdemand  for money  that we  can't  fully explain  in the very short  run.  Iwould agree  with you that  it  is  not  likely  [to  continue]  over a  longerperiod of  time, but  I don't  know what  is  going to  happen  in  the  veryshort run.I wonder whether  [my  summary]  is  consistent  in  substance withwhat  everybody in varying degrees  seems  to  be  saying.  Well,  let  meapproach  the  funds  rate  first, where  there  isn't  much disagreement.  Iwould  think  10  to  14  percent  makes  a  lot  of  sense  just  in  terms  of  theform.  We're about  in  the middle  of  that now  range and  it  allows  [arate.  I don't  say  that with any feeling  that  10  percent  ought  to  bean  absolute  floor  in any sense;  it  hasn't been  in  the past  and thisseems  a logical  range  to  put  down.  Almost  everybody has  said thatwith  some  exceptions.  I guess  everybody on  the Committee  has  saidthat.  I have  no problem with  that.  I wonder  a little whether  theborrowing  level  that  people were  talking about  isn't  a little  high interms  of  the balance of  risks  and possibilities here.  I'd be  a littlemore  comfortable with, let's  say,  a $300  million number  than  the  $350or  $350  to  $400  million  that  people mentioned, considering where weare now  and considering  this  average pattern  in  the past,  in  order  toprovide  a  little  more assurance  that  rates  are  not going  to  rise  evenif  these  numbers come  in more  or  less  as  projected.  So,  I would raisethat  question.We  have  a clear majority for  around 4 and 9 percent  [for M1and M2]  on a November-to-March basis.  In any  event,  I think thatwould be  interpreted,  if  that's where we  alight,  as  our  not beingunduly  concerned by a somewhat  higher number  than  that.  If  we putdown a higher number,  I'd feel  more  strongly that  if  it  came  in  lowerand interest rates  were  declining appreciably, we  shouldn't push anyharder  than necessary just  to hit  the  5 and  10  percent numbers.  Butthe  4 and 9 percent  numbers  suit me  all right with the understandingthat we're not  going  to be very upset by some  overrun  and startingwith a slightly lower borrowing number  than  the weight  of  opinion hassuggested here.  I'm  just  a little worried  about  that borrowing numberbeing a bit too  high.  And I think we do  [need  to]  interpret  thesenumbers--I don't  know how to put  that  in  the  directive--somehow in  thelight  of  what  is  going  on in  NOW accounts,  if  we  can make  any sense  ofit,  as  opposed  to  a general  increase.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  there's  some  room to bring  it  down.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  That  [depends  on]  the  initial  borrowing number.What  happens  initially with  that  borrowing?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I don't  think much.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think  anything much would happen.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I think the  funds  rate would  stay somewhatabove  the  discount  rate  at  that  level  of borrowing.  When borrowing inthe  first  two weeks  of  this  intermeeting period was  around  $200million,  the  funds  rate  was  a little  below the  then discount  rate.And in  the  next week borrowing was  $493  million,  followed by  $268million and  thus  far  this  week  $330 million  or  so,  and  the  funds  ratehas  been  about  1/2  point  above  the discount  rate.  So,  it's probably  alittle  above--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  is  obviously a  fine  judgment, but  I'dworry a  little  about  forcing the  funds  rate on  the  high side  of whereit  has been or maybe even a  little higher  than where  it  has been, asopposed  to making  sure  it  doesn't  rise  in  the  very short  run.  I'm noteven  sure  $300  million makes  that  [certain],  but  it's  just  a  questionof where we want  to  take  the  risks.  My feel  for  the  situation  is  thatit  is more  consistent with  the  comments  I hear  around the  table  aboutnot  wanting  an increase  in  the  funds  rate right  out  of  the box or  noteven wanting  it  if  money growth gets  a  little  higher.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  So  4 and  9 percent  would be  the  numbers  in  thedirective?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  in  that  interpretation,  I think we'dsay something  in the  directive--I haven't  got  any wording--

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Or  somewhat higher?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think  I want  to  bias  it  to  thatextent  but  [I'd  include]  some  language  that  this  takes  carefulinterpretation of  the NOW account  situation.  Maybe that's  hard to  do;I haven't  worked out any  language.  But whatever  the directive  says,that  is  what  we mean.

[SECTION]

MS. TEETERS.  We  could do  it  by saying  "around" 4 and  9percent and let  that--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  having  "around" is  fine  with me  andtaking  account of  or analyzing  the  figures  in  light  of  the  fact  thatthese  are  not  shift-adjusted and have  a big NOW account  component.That's not  good  language, but  that's--

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  And praying  a lot!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  On the other hand, if  we went  with aslightly  higher number,  I'd also put  in the  directive  that  this  istaking  account  of  the  fact--and we  can do  it  this  way too--that we arenot  using a shift-adjusted number and  that  the  discrepancy has beenquite  large recently  and we  assume  it's  going  to  continue  to  besizable.  So,  theoretically, we  can do  it  either way.  It  will  be hard12/21-22/81-63-to get  that  language  in  there  but  [we  need]  some  allusion  to  theproblem that we're moving from  a shift-adjusted number.  We have  had along  [explanation in]  parentheses  in  the directive  that we weretalking about a shift-adjusted number;  now  I think we need a long  [onein]  parentheses  that  we're not.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  Is  that  an  illusion or elusion?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  made  a three  point difference  in November.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  From a perception point of  view, I think we'rea little better  off with 4 and  9 percent  and tolerating somewhathigher growth than with  5 and 10  percent,  tolerating  somewhat  lower.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  From the  perception of  whom?  From the  financial

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Well,  I don't  want  to  get  into  that  one!  Ihave some  rather strong  feelings  about  the  fact  that  the criticalthing we have  to  do  is  to  find a way  to  get  long-term  interest ratesdown.  So when we  target  on that  sort  of  thing,  the perception of  whatwe do  has  considerable  importance  since  expectations  are  so much  [afactor]  in  those  long-term rates.  But  I don't want  to  get off  on  adiatribe on  that  issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm a little bothered by the 5 and 10--more by the  10  than  the  5--which  is  above  our  long-range target  and,unlike M1,  coming off  a high number not  a low number.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  True.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  What  do we have  for  the  long-term range?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  But what  is  going  to  bring down M2  growth  in  theperiod?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I was just  going  to  ask.  What,  ifanything, is  your  estimate  of M2  based upon  here, Mr. Axilrod?  Whatis  the  estimate  for  December?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  for December,  the M2  growth estimate israther high,  given  [the  data]  we  now have.  In  the  last week growth  ofmoney market  funds was  a little  slower.  That's not much to  base  [yourdown, with a  lag,  following a period  of  declining market  rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And there  is  a chance  that money marketfunds will  really  slow down now, because  the money market  certificaterate  is  at--and  in the next  couple  of  weeks  may even be  above--themoney market  fund rate  for  the  first  in  a long  time.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  That's  not  going  to help M2,  though.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Won't that  shift  into  another  component of  M2?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well, maybe.12/21-22/81-64-

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  We  really  have not  allowed  for  the  savingsaccounts  to  show the  same  kind  of  strength,  so  to  speak,  that  they'veshown.  If  they  showed  that  kind of  strength,  it  would spill  over alsointo NOW accounts,  I think.  We  haven't  allowed for  that  continuing.Those  are  the  two principal  factors.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  You have  a December  estimate  of  12.6  percent  inthe Bluebook?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's  right,  and  a very marked slowing in

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  You  have  it  dropping  to  7.3  percent  in January.I don't quite  see what  is  going  to bring about  that  slowing  from  12  to7 percent,  if  we  don't  really care what  the  figures  are.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  those are  the  two  factors,  GovernorPartee.  The  only  thing I  could offer is  to  look  at  October, which was8 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I didn't  realize  the December  estimate  wasquite  that  high.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's  the  trouble,  you  see;  that  really pinchesit.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Assuming you go  ahead with one  ormore  of  these  three  conceptual  changes  in the  definition  of  M2,  thatwould be effective at  the beginning  of  January or what?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we  can make  the  two  we're  talkingabout effective  right away, I guess, because we have  the  numbers.  Idon't  think we have  the  numbers  for--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  we were  assuming  that  at  the beginning ofB.  But we  had hoped to  make  the  other changes  effective  in  Februarywhen we've  [typically]  done the  seasonals  and  the benchmarking  and doit  all  at  once.  Because  there are  other--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  And making  it  retroactive?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Can you even do  the  IRA/Keoghs  in

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That  I don't know.  That  depends.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You  raised another  question, now that  Ithink of  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  No,  I was  thinking  of  the  other  ones.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We have  a period here,  [November toadjusted, and there  is  quite  a difference.  What are we  talking abouthere?  A  shift-adjusted figure  for  one  month and a--12/21-22/81-65-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I was  assuming you'd  start  in Januarywith regular  M1.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  but what  is  this  number we put  down--the 4 or  5 percent or whatever?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  M1.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  It's M1.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  For  December too?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  you're  comparing  it  with old M1-B, whichis  in  effect M1.  That's  right.  M1-B not  shift-adjusted  is  M1.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  the  only difference  is  what  mighthappen  in  December.  How much difference  is  that?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  there's  roughly a  12--

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  We  have  to  be consistent.  If  thebase  is  going  to  be M1-B unadjusted,  then  December has  to  be  treatedthat way.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.You  take  off  from  the regular M1-B  series.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.Isn't  it  wonderful  to  be able  to  deal  in  suchprecision?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  That's why we  all--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  that number we  know.  It's  the  shift-adjusted number that's  a  little doubtful.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  it's really M1  that's  8 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  And  then it  has  to  drop to  2 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  it  rose  from  3 percent  to  11  percent  inone  month.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I know.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  As  long  as we  have  this  around  4 percent,  I'd--

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Yes,  that may be  the more critical  point."Around" means  anything  from 0 to  10.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let  me  take  this  in  an orderly way.The funds  rate  range  is  10  to  14  percent;  it  was  at  least  among  themembers  of  the  Committee.  I'm not  sure  there was  any disagreementwith  that.  That  is  where we  are  on the  funds  rate,  I think.  Theborrowing  really is  the  only operating decision we're making  today.  I12/21-22/81-66-gave  you a  little  case  for  $300  million.  The great majority was  for$350  to  $400  million.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  I can buy  $300  million.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Me  too.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  If  $300  million  is  going  to producewhat  Steve  thinks  it will produce--namely,  [a  fed funds  rate]  a  shadeover  the  12  percent  discount rate--then  I'd go  with that.  That'sbasically what  I was targeting  for  when I said  $350  million.  So  itdoesn't bother me  if--

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  That's  the way  I feel  about  it  too.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  If  it  doesn't  work out  that  way, we'll  kill  themessenger!  I was  going  to  say put  it  in--

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  If  it  doesn't work out  that way, raise  theborrowings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think  that's  the way  it will workout.  I wouldn't  die if  the  federal  funds  rate  was  11-7/8 percent  oreven  11-3/4  percent.  We're  at  $300  million on  the  borrowing?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Suits  me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  All  right,  Now we'll  talk  about  thecosmetics.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  You're  being a  little  too  frank!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The range  here is  not  huge.  We  can  cutthrough  it  all  if  you want and  say 4-1/2  and  9-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  Oh,  I think  that  gives  a  feeling of  greaterprecision  [than  is  warranted];  really  that's nitpicking  it.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  there were  some who wanted to  accept  anovershoot.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We've  often used  "1/2"  and we're--

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I know, but--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Not  that  often,  it  seems  to me,  inthe  time  I've been  on  [the  Committee].  It  certainly makes us  look  alittle  sillier when we  miss by a big  amount  if  we put  our  targets  interms  of  halves.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think we have a  long record  of  puttingthem  in  terms  of  halves,  in my memory, but  I--

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  And missing  them by  a large  amount

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  I'd  rather go  with either  4 or  5 with  someappropriate  language than with  4-1/2.  I continue to prefer 4  and 9.12/21-22/81-67-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  How about  both:  "about 4 to  5 percent"  and"about  9 to  10  percent"?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I think  the  Committee once  did have  [somethinglike]  that  in  the  directive, too,  for  some  reason.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I don't  see how we  can  target  over  9percent  unless we more  or  less  agree  that we  are  going to  raise  [thelong-run  target  for]  M2.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  That  is  exactly what was  going through my mind.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I am going to  vote to  raise  [the  targetfor]  M2  at  the next  meeting.  We  are  starting  in  1982.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Your  mind is  supposed  to be  open  for  awhile.  It  is  supposed to  be open  for  [unintelligible]  too.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  There are  some  who would  feel  strongly--

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  I like  "about 4 and  9."

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Get  it  down.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Me  too.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  all  right with me.  But  in  any casewe have  an understanding  that  if  it  goes  a  little higher than  that, wewill not be  too bothered.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I would prefer  5 and 10  percent with no  suchunderstanding, even though it  may produce what  I don't want--a  rise  ininterest rates.  I think  it  is  just bad in principle  that  we havefallen  into  implicitly targeting the  funds  rate  only.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's a very bad principle but  I thought we  hadgotten away  from  that.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  We've done  that  repeatedly.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  We're going  to  have  to  get Henry a red suit  anda beard here!  I sense a conversion in  process  here.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  1982  brings  a new Henry Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I'm just  being  consistent.  I didn't want  tolet  [rates]  drop  too  far;  I don't  want  them to  rise  too  fast.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  I agree.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't know how to  interpret that  commentbut....  The  only reason  I hesitate a little  on  the  5 and  10  percentis  that  the  10  looks  a  little high  to  me,  just  visually.  I think thatis  what  we  are  talking about here.

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  Well,  Mr. Chairman, you said  it  was  cosmetic,  so  4and 9 percent  with  the appropriate  language would--12/21-22/81-68-

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  An  alternative  is  5 and  9 percent  with anunderstanding  that we  may get  even more  than  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I would be  happier with  5 and  9.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  They're not  consistent.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  We aren't  compromising.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  I think  Chuck's  point  is  very well  taken.We're  looking at  a growth  rate  of  M1-B shift-adjusted  in our  thinkingwhereas we are now  targeting on  non  shift-adjusted.  The  differencewas  3 percentage points.  That  is  quite--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Right  at  the moment.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  It  was  11.1  versus  8.8  percent  in  the month  of

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  and  [consider]  the problem  we've gotif  that  reverses  itself.  We  don't know what is  going on here.Suppose  that  suddenly reverses  itself  in  January.We'll  just  try  to  arrive  at  the greatest  consensus  here.  IfI get  preferences,  I'll  know the  answer.  Who  prefers  4 and  9?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Wait  a minute.  What are  our  chances  of  hitting9 percent  on M2  if  we  have  5 percent on M1?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I think  these are very  small  differences,Governor  Teeters,  given our  track record  in predicting theserelationships.  I don't  think  it  is  a matter of  strong  significancefor  the Committee,  actually.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  These  differences  are small.  What we'reassuming  is  that  we're going  to  continue  to  have  a  pretty bigdiscrepancy  if  we  shift adjust  it,  which we're  not going  to doanymore.  I think what we're saying with  the  5 percent  is  that  it[involves]  an  assumption  in  substance  that  there  is  a  lot  of  NOWaccount  [growth]  in  this.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  One possible way to  break  this  is  to  say:"seeks behavior  of  reserve  aggregates  consistent with  growth of  M1  andM2  in  a range  of  about  4 to  5 percent  and  9 to  10  percent."  It  givesboth numbers and has  a  range and has  "about."

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  We  still  have  to  draw the path, which makes  adifference.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Draw  the path  somewhere  in between  [that  rangefor  M1].

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  put  it  at  4-1/2.  That  is  a way of  doing4-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Without being  too  precise.12/21-22/81-69-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  can do  that.  The  only drawback I seeis  that  in  some ways  one  could argue  that  it  sounds  more precise--thatsomehow we're willing  to  tolerate  4 to  5 percent  but  we'd get  veryupset  if  it's  outside.  But  I don't  know that  that's  such a big deal.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  In New York the  market participantsseeing  "around 4 to  5 percent" will  tend  to  assume  that  the  "around"refers to  the area between  4 and 5 percent.  And  it  gets  us  a  littleless  precision if  we just  say  "around 4" or  "around 5."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  know;  that  really doesn'tsound too bad to  me.  But  I think a disadvantage  of  saying  "around 4to  5 percent"  is--

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Well, M1  for  last  year is  estimated  to  come  outat  4.7  percent,  and some  little downward movement  looks  a littlebetter  cosmetically.  I think  the  4 percent  is  a little  better  than  5percent and I am  forced to  settle on  it  for  that  reason.  But  Iwouldn't be  disturbed if  it  hit  5 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  whatever we decide upon, we have  tosay here  someplace  in  the  directive or  elsewhere that  we have  thisproblem with  the  fact  that  we think December  is  coming in  high.  Sowhatever number  we have here  is  in  a sense  not as  high  for January,we're operating  off a high December number.  I think  that  ought  to beclarified somehow  in  the  record.  Mr. Axilrod  is  trying to  fiddlearound with this  language  and it  is  so  obscure  that  I don't understandwhat  it  means.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  That  is  the best kind!

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  Would you like  to  read  it?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "Taking account  of  the  significance  ofshifts  as  they may  develop between NOW and  similar accounts  and otherassets..."

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  NOW and similar  accounts?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  And  other unknown phenomena!

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  UFOs!

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  No,  UMOs:  unidentified monetary objects!

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  That's not  obscure,  that's just--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  My quick reaction is  that we're not goingto  be  able  to  do  it  in a parenthetic sentence.  We've  got  to  writeanother  sentence  in  there  after  the  one  that  talks  about  "seeksbehavior"  etc.  Then we  could say: Committee  recognized  that  the  target  had to  be evaluated  in  the  lightof  the  fact  that  shift adjustment was no  longer being made  and thatthe performance  of  the aggregates would have  to  evaluated in  the  lightof  NOW accounts,  which have been exceptionally  large recently,"  orsome  such thing."In reaching  this  decision the12/21-22/81-70-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I was  trying,  Mr.  Chairman, to  make  that  applyalso  to M2  to  allow  for  savings deposits which have been very  strongas  well.  And we're not predicting any  strength here.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let's  decide  upon what we want  to  sayfirst before we decide  upon what,  in effect,  the  footnote  says.  Howdoes  the  around  4 to  5 percent  and  around  9 to  10  percent  strike  you?

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I'm less  happy with  it  than  I am  with a precisenumber.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  You want  4.7  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  No,  I want  a  [single]  digit.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Well,  there  is  virtue in  the  Chairman'sproposal.  We've missed every  short-term path  this  year by aconsiderable margin and  I don't  know  why we should  insist  on misplacedprecision when we will  be  lucky to  come  even close  to  the  intermeetingpath, if  the past  record  is  any  indication.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  The problem with  it  is  that  I think  Tony isright.  The  Fed watchers  will misinterpret  if  given any  opportunity todo  so.  And  I think it  gives  them a greater opportunity tomisinterpret  if  we  say  "around 4  to  5 percent"  in that  they will  infact  look at  that  as  a range  in which we're trying  to  operate, with adegree  of precision  that  we don't  have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that's what  I thought  in  a way,  too.But when  I think about  it  more,  I am not  sure  what your  objection  isto  "around 4  to  5." Is  it  in substance  that  it  is  too  high?

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  No,  my objection  to  it  is  that  I prefer  4 and 9percent  and a willingness  to  tolerate  somewhat higher  growth.  It  iseasier  to  draw the path  and  I just  think  it  works  better  than your--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  clearly, we'd draw the  path at  4-1/2percent  if  we had  "around 4  to  5 percent"  initially.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  I still  prefer 4  and 9.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  This would be published when, Murray, February5th?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  February  5th.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And when do  you  [testify],  do you know?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Probably February 20th  with Proxmire.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  I have a preference  for 4 and  9 percent, butnot  on  the  cosmetics.  It  is  a  small  distinction but  I still  think  theeconomy will  turn  around, and I would like  to  have the  leeway down  theroad rather  than now.  But  the  initial  borrowing of  $300  million  isfine with me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  how do  we reconcile  this  smalldifference?  After  listening to  all  of  this,  how many still  prefer 412/21-22/81-71-and  9?  How many prefer  around 4 to  5 and around 9 to  10?  We  haven'tseen  all  the hands  up.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  You  haven't  asked about who  would prefer  5 and10.

[SECTION]

MR.  ROOS.  You wanted  just voting members?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  just  voting members  at  this  point.That  leaves  two with  a preference  for  5 to  10,  I assume.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  I have  a preference.  I didn't  know how you weregoing--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And I thought  you were  going to  say  "prefer" and"live with."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  all  right.  [Our  preferences]  arealmost  symmetrical.  It  sounds  to  me  as  if  everybody ought  to  be  ableto  live  with the  "around 4 to  5."

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  And the  9 to  10?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And  9 to  10.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  It  is  the principle of  it  that  bothers me.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  is  the principle?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  That we're now beginning  to  fudge  thedifference between  4 and  5 by  saying  "around."  The next  time  it  willbe around  4 to  6 and  then around  4 to  7.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Suddenly,  it  becomes  our  long-term forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  It  becomes  increasingly realistic.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  I think Henry has  detected  a trend.

[SECTION]

MR. ROOS.  Anything  that  is  a departure  from  customaryterminology  leads market people  to  read things  into  it,  I think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Have we  ever  given  a range before?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I know we  did once  before.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  I am pretty sure  we  did.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I am not  sure  if  it  was  for  both M1  and M2.  Itcertainly was  on M1.

[SECTION]

MR. CORRIGAN.  In  this particular case we  can probably getaway with  it  a  little more  easily simply because  of  this problem  ofgoing  from  shift-adjusted to  non  shift-adjusted.  I hadn't  thought  ofthat.  That  really does  make a difference  in  terms  of  our  transition.

[SECTION]

MR. SCHULTZ.  Well,  I just  expressed my preference, but  I'mnot  going to  fall  on my sword  about  this.12/21-22/81-72-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How many can  live with  the  4  to  5 and  9  to10  [formulation]?

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  Do you want a  show of hands?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  Again,  I just want  to  say  that  if  wedo  9  to  10  percent,  then that  does  imply very strongly a  case--and Ithink the markets  will  definitely read  it  that  way--that we're  goingto  come  out  in February with a  revised figure  that  is  somewhat  higherthan 9 percent  on M2.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  I don't  think that  interpretation  is  necessaryany more  than  it  meant we were going  to  revise  the  targets  on M1-Bwhen we  put  a number  like  7 percent  for M1-B  shift-adjusted during thesummer  or  early fall.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  When  I say this,  somehow we  are going  toget  in here  that we  think  the  December number is  going  to  be higherthan  either of  these  numbers.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  We  don't  want  to  say  thatspecifically.  Suppose  we're wrong?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think we  can be  wrong.  Well,  wecould be wrong,  but  it  would  take  a very sharp drop  in both of  them  tocome  in  below 4  to  5 percent  on M1.  It's  now estimated at  8.8percent,  I think.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  The policy  record  in  that  light,  Mr.Chairman, with  regard  to  M2--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Anything  is  possible.  I wouldn't  promiseyou  that  it  couldn't  come  in  within  that  range but  it  would take  avery sharp drop  in  the  last  two  weeks  of December.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  With regard  to M2--and also M1,  moretentatively--the policy  record  [for  the November  meeting]  clearlyindicates  that  the  Committee  expected a  slower growth  rate  in  thecourse  of  the quarter.  That  is,  the  9 to  10  is  really consistent--itwouldn't be  that specific with  something like  7  to  8 percent  [forM1-B].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  figure  is  between alternatives A  andB;  what does  that  imply for  quarterly growth  rates?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  For M1  it  would be  somewhere between  4-1/2  and5-3/4  percent  on a quarterly  average basis,  and  for M2  somewherebetween  9-3/4  and 10-1/2  percent.  They  are  fairly high.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Just  taking  the midpoint, the  growth ratesare  a  little  over  5 percent  and around  10  percent on  a quarterlyaverage basis,  which  is  the nearest  thing to  a  long-term  target.Whatever we put  down will  be  high  in relation  to  the  long-term targetsinterpreted on  a quarter-to-quarter basis.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  the  monthly growth rates  are  slow.12/21-22/81-73-

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  [If  we  say]  4 to  5 percent  and  9 to  10  percent,I have a  little problem with  the understanding  that  we are  not  goingto  be  that  concerned if  it  comes  out  higher.  That  is  a bit  of  adifficult bridge  for me  to  get  across because  I would find  acceptablethe  4 and 9 percent  with the  understanding  that  you  talked aboutearlier but  I am a  little uncomfortable with  it.  So,  to  go  to  4 to  5and 9 to  10  makes me  even more uncomfortable.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Just  to  follow on that,  Bob,  I would prefer  thatthe Desk,  without regard  to  how it  comes  out  in  the  directive,  starttargeting with 4 percent  rather than  4  to  5 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You know, we are now  talking about  verysmall  differences  here.  I am inclined  to  think  that we  are best  offwith  the  4 to  5 and  9 to  10  [formulation].  Whether we  set  that  pathat  4 or  4-1/2  percent  is  going to  make  what--a  $50  million differenceby 3 or  4 weeks  from now?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Something  like  that.  [No],  by March  it  is  thatbig, so  it  is  less  [for  the  next  few weeks].

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  SOLOMON.  My concern  is  not  with the  substance.We  all  know  the difference  is  very small.  My concern  is  that  I thinkwe  are  loosing a certain  sense  of  respect  because  of  how outsidepeople  see these  things.  They see  an overrun  in M2.  They see  ustargeting 9 to  10  percent, which  is  over  our preliminary M2  target.It  seems  to  me  that  there will be  an  immediate  feeling in  the  market--I don't  see  how we  could  avoid that--that  we probably will move  the M2target up  in  February and there  will  be  talk about  some  easing.  If  weare willing  to  do  that,  all  right;  but  I don't  see how we  can avoidthat  impression.  If  we  had had a shortfall  in M2,  sure, we could  getaway with  9 to  10  percent.  I don't  see how we  can escape  that  marketreaction;  if  that market  reaction doesn't bother you,  all right,  but--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But  there  will be  an  explanation  in  therethat we  were high  in  December,  which encompasses  this  period.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  we  could  say that  the growth ratesimplied  for January and February, given  the present  estimates, wouldbe below 9 percent.  I really  think we  can handle  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think we  can  find a handle on  that,  too,Lyle.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Tony, the  present  directive  calls  for M2  at  anannual  rate  of  around 11  percent.  So  what  is  different  about  this?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.  You are  talking about  the  short  term.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  we  are  talking about  the  short  term here.The M2 growth rate  was  16  percent  for the month  of November.  And howare  we going  to  bring it  down?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let's  go ahead with  the 4 to  5 and 9to  10  and see  what  comes  up.  Before  we  vote,  there  is  this  question[of  the precise  language  to use].  I am afraid we  are not going  to  be12/21-22/81-74-able  to  draft  this  very well  sitting here.  I may exceed  the  limits  ofyour  confidence  and trust,  but  if  you would delegate to  me  inconsultation with  the  staff  the  task  of  putting another  sentence  inthe  directive,  I would be pleased to  undertake  that  responsibility.It  would  say we are  moving  from  a shift-adjusted number  to  a nonshift-adjusted number  and M1  growth running a  little high  in  Decemberbecause  of  this  NOW account  bulge.  We  would get a  little  flavor  ofthat  in  another sentence  in  the directive.

[SECTION]

MR.  SCHULTZ.  I have great  confidence  that  between you andMr.  Axilrod you  can make  it properly  obscure!

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I second  that  vote  of  confidence.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  You  are  full  of  Christmas  spirit!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  the  alternative  is  putting  it  inthe  policy record, which  the  staff  will  do  anyway in  other  language.This would be  in the  directive.  Is  that  agreeable?  With  thatunderstanding, let  us vote.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Now  that  this  has been decided,  I wonder  if  Ican  return  for just  a second to  your  comments  a while  ago  that  I foundvery  interesting, to  put  it  mildly,  that  once we had decided that  theonly real  operational  decision  this  time was  the borrowing assumption,we  could now deal with  the  cosmetics.  That brings  to  my mind thequestion:  Why don't we  in  the  Bluebook, Steve,  have  some moreanalysis  on  this  borrowing assumption  that  goes with  the  variousalternatives  and  its  implications?  This  is  a very key part  of  what weanalysis,  and recommendations.  Is  there  some  reason that  it  is  notdesirable  or what?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  we  could certainly  expand on  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let me  just  interpret  my comment.  I donot  interpret my comment  as meaning at  all  that  these  aggregatefigures  are  not  important.  The problem  I talked  about  is  that withina  1-month perspective what  we  do operationally  to  affect  our reachingthose  targets  is  to  set  the path.  It  doesn't mean that  these  othernumbers  are  not very  important  in  a  longer-term perspective.  But  theconnection  in  any 1-month  or  6-week period between meetings  is  very12/21-22/81-75-loose.  It  does  in  an  operational  sense  come  down  to  setting thatreserve path--to  state  it  more  accurately--rather  than  the  borrowingassumption.  The  borrowing assumption is  part  of  it.  It  does  not  meanthat we  are  operating on the  basis  of  ignoring these  numbers.  But  thenumbers  are  cosmetic.  They are not  cosmetic  at  all  in  a longerperspective.  I just want  that  clarification  in  the  record.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Even  if  you had not made  that  comment,  I wasstill  going  to  bring this point  up.  There  is  a hidden variablerunning around  loose here on  these borrowing assumptions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  the point  is  still--

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  And I would very strongly urge that  we  getsomething on it  in  the  text  in  the  Bluebook,  unless  I am missing somereason why  they don't  do  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it  is  in  the  Bluebook,  isn't  it?  Ithought  you were raising  a question of  whether  it  should be  in thedirective.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Maybe  I could explain,  President  Balles.  Wecould develop  it  further, of  course.  But one  of  the  things  that  cameout  of  that  study we did  last year was  that  in  terms  of  analysis  andachievement  of  targets,  the  best kind of borrowing  assumption toassume  at  the  beginning of  our path is  the  borrowing assumption  thatseemed  to be  consistent  with the  interest rates  that come  out  of  themoney supply  target.  So,  generally what we  try  to  put  down  is  whatthe  Committee  in  reaching  its decision may wish  to  use  as  an initialborrowing  figure.  Heaven alone  knows what  the  final  borrowing will bebecause  that  depends  on how the  money supply actually behaves.Presumably what  the  Committee makes  its  decision  on, in  some  sense,  isfirst whether  it  believes  those  relationships,  and second, how itmight wish  to  tilt,  if  it  wishes  to  tilt,  the  initial  starting point.But  after  the  initial  starting point,  this  borrowing is  pretty welldominated by what happens  to  the money supply.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  But  the  borrowing assumption is  generallyviewed by people  who look  at  these  things at  all  as  a proxy for  thefunds rate.  So,  if  we put this  into  the directive,  it  will  beinterpreted as  having taken a step  in  the direction  of  at  leastinitially targeting on the  funds  rate.  Now, it  is  true  that borrowingshifts  thereafter;  but  quite  often we  take  steps  to  prevent  that,  likeforgiving low volumes  of  borrowing  or redistributing borrowing  over  aperiod  of weeks.  These  are all  ways  of  focusing more  fully on  thefunds rate  than  a pure  money supply target.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Henry, I was  never suggesting that we ought  toput  the  borrowing assumption  in  the published directive as  part  of  thespecifications.  I was  urging that  there be  more analysis  and sets  ofassumptions  about different borrowing levels  as part  of  [the  Bluebook]for  the  benefit of  the  decisionmakers.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  that would reassure me.  The  second thingthat would reassure me  is  if  we  left  the borrowing  more  fully to  findits  own level  during  the period.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We have  to  start someplace,  though, Henry.12/21-22/81-76-

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Oh yes,  we  need a  starting point.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That  is  all we  are  talking  about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  I understand what you  are  saying--Idon't know what you have  in mind in  substance--in principle  I thinkwhat you  are saying  is  fine.  Whatever  analysis  we need we  should havein there.  Maybe you should  talk  to  Steve  a bit more  concretely aboutwhat you might  have  in mind.  I thought  he  did put  in  what he  thoughtwas consistent with  these numbers.  The  Committee has  modified it  alittle  today and on  other days,  on  the basis  of  where  we wanted  totake  the  risk, so  to  speak.  But why don't you  talk  to Steve  aboutputting  something  in.The  Secretary raises  the  question of whether  we  are  going  tohave  a Monday  afternoon  session  at  the  next  meeting.  Normally wewould in  the  light  of  the  fact  that  we have  to  settle  on the  long-range  targets.  So,  I think  you ought  to  assume  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  There will  be  a  longer projection  [horizon],too, won't  there?  You will  have  to  give  us  some  look  at  1983?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  We  also  plan  to  have alternative  strategies,  ifthe Committee wishes, as  we  have  put  it  at  other times,  onimplications  for phasing down  or  staying  the  same.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  other  item that we have  is  the  releaseof  the memoranda of  discussion  for early  '76.  Maybe you  ought  todescribe  this  situation, Mr. Altmann.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Well,  as  we  said in  the memo to  you, thesememoranda  for  the  first  three meetings  of  1976  are  described  asunofficial because  they have never  been presented to  the  Committee  forreview or  acceptance  as  we did  in  the  old days.  We were  under  a courtorder  to  accede  to requests  for  the  segregable  factual portions  of  thememoranda  and  the  Committee made the  decision  in  May of  1976  todiscontinue the  memoranda of  discussion after  the memorandum  forof  them was  given  a low priority and  they were not  completed untilsome years  later and by  then the  composition of  the  Committee  hadchanged.  That  is  essentially  the  issue.  They could be withheld asbeing unofficial  documents.  They  could be  withheld, I suppose,  evenif  they were  regarded as  official memoranda.There  is  one  other  issue  that  I brought  to  the  attention ofthe  Chairman because  I thought he  should be  aware of  it  before we putthese  out.  At  both  the  February and March meetings  there  was  anexecutive  session which concerned  the Merrill  case--that  is,  the  suitunder  the  Freedom of  Information Act.  And at  the  February meetingthere was  a report  by the  General  Counsel  on  the  oral  decision  thathad  been handed down by  the District  Court  at  that  time,  which wasagainst  the  Committee,  on release  of  the  directive  immediately and onrelease  of  the  segregable  facts  in  the memoranda  of  discussion.  Atthe  February meeting  the Committee  agreed  to  the  appointment  of  asubcommittee  to  consider what  to  do with the  memoranda of  discussionin  light  of  this  court  decision,  which was  obviously  troublesome  inmany ways.  At  the March meeting, which was  after the  written decisionof  the court,  the  General  Counsel  again reviewed the  options  and  the12/21-22/81-77-Committee  agreed  to  appeal  the  decision on  the directive,  but not  onthe memoranda  of  discussion.  As  you all probably know, that  case  wentto  the  Supreme Court  and back  to  the  District  Court,  and  the  DistrictCourt ruled  in  June of  this  year that  the  Committee  or  the  Board  didnot have  to  release  the  directive  immediately.  That was  not  appealed,so  that  is  a dead issue  at  this  point.  But  this  would probably be  thefirst  time that  the  System has  acknowledged the  link  between  theMerrill  case  and the discontinuance of  the memoranda of  discussion.  Ithink everyone  connected with  the case  assumed  that was  the  fact.  Andin  testimony before  Congressional  committees  starting in  1977 withChairman Burns  on new legislation to  require  some detailed minutes,  itwas  said  that  the Board would go  along with that  legislation providedthere was  an  explicit  relief  from the  requirements  of  the Freedom  ofInformation Act.  Later  testimony of  Governor  Coldwell and then ViceChairman  Schultz  made  the  same points.  I think  it  was generallyassumed that  there  was  a  link between  the Merrill  case  and thediscontinuation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You  said  something  that  confused me a bit,if  I understood you.  I thought we  were releasing these  minutes  in  thepast as  entirely a voluntary act.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Well,  it  began as  a voluntary  act  and continuedto  be  so  in  the  sense  that  the  court  order  only required  that weprovide  the  segregable portions  of  the memoranda  that were  factual.We would have had  to provide  that  on request.  But  we  continued topublish  the  entire memoranda with only  those deletions  made  inaccordance with our guidelines.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  but  on  this  segregable facts  issue,there  was  a case  about  that.  The only reason we haven't  released thesegregable  facts  is  that  nobody has  asked?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  I think  that  is  the  case.  Mr. Mannion may haveanother--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Did you  ever  see  that  draft  with the  segregablefacts?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  I remember  that  discussion, but  Ithought  the whole  thing was dropped.

[SECTION]

MS.  TEETERS.  But we have  only released  these  with a 5-yeardelay, is  that  correct?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  That  is  correct.  I should have  stated at  theoutset  that  in releasing  these memoranda  for  early 1976  we would befollowing  the  schedule  that we  had  followed  for a number  of  years.The only  thing  about  them that  is  different  is  that  they are"unofficial."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I  thought  the  only  issue  here wasbasically that we  are  releasing  them now,  though it  is  questionablewhether we  have  to.  But  if  we  release  them now, we have  continued  thepractice we  had  in  the  past.  Nobody  can raise  any question  of  ourholding back  something  that we have.  On  the  other hand,  if  we  releasethem,  it  calls  attention  to  the  fact  that we  no  longer  [prepare]  these12/21-22/81-78-documents.  And  it  may engender  some discussion  instead of  letting  thesleeping  dogs  lie.  What  do  you have  to  say?

[SECTION]

MR. MANNION.  Everyone realizes  that  we  don't prepare  thememoranda of  discussion  any  longer.  If  you  are  ever challenged, youalways  would have to  release  segregable  facts;  those are  not  subjectto  any privilege under  the  Freedom of  Information Act.  What  theCommittee has been doing  on  this  5-year  delay basis  is  releasing  theentire memorandum  of  discussion  for  each meeting except  for  certainitems  that  may relate  to  a  foreign  country or  central bank or  someconcern of  the Treasury Department.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And that  has  been entirely  voluntary?

[SECTION]

MR. MANNION.  That  is  correct,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  question  before  us  is:  Do  we persistin our  entirely voluntary policy, recognizing  these  three  haven't beenchecked the way  the  others have  been checked by individual  members  ofthe  Committee?  And we will  just  say  that  these  three months  are  allwe  have.  Or  do  we  forget  about  it  on  the  basis  that  nobody has  askedand who  cares?  I don't have  a strong  feeling  one way or  the  other,but  I don't  think  this will  attract  much attention.  Is Mr.  Coynehere?  We put  these  out  without  an  announcement as  I recall.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  We have  not put  out  an--

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  I think  they will  go  completely unnoticed.  Iwould bet  that you would not  get  one  request.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Hoping  that Mr.  Coyne  is  correct,  I haveno  trouble  myself  in putting  these  out  with a notice  that  they haven'tbeen checked  the  way the  others  have but  this  completes  [the  releaseof]  what  we have  and is  in accordance with  [past  practice].

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  Even when we  have  announced--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  There is  this  discussion  of  the Merrillcase  in them, but  that  doesn't bother me much.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Can you possibly  remember what  you said back  in1976?  I couldn't.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I am  the  only one  here who  was  at  those meetingsand  I couldn't.

[SECTION]

MR. FORD.  Nobody can  spot  something he  wishes  he never said?

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  That  is  a  long  time  to  remember what  we  said.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I was  there,  too,  and--

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  It  is  better  not  to  start  down  that  routebecause  if  we do,  then we  do have  to  stamp  them as  official.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Yes.12/21-22/81-79-

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Put  them  out  now and if  [no  member  of  theCommittee]  has  looked at  them,  they  are purely  staff  documents.  Ithink we  are  safer  that  way  than  to  start  trying  to  hunt  down  thosepeople  who might remember.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  We have  a prefatory note  which states  thesituation in  terms  of  their being called  "unofficial" because  theywere prepared after  a  time  lag  and had not  gone  through  the  [usualreview]  procedure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  if  there  is  no  objection or nocontrary concern, we  will  just  put  them out  as  quietly as  possible,which has been  the  case.

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  We don't  issue  a press  release  on  this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  While we are  making them available, we  arenot announcing  that  they are  available,  if  I understand thiscorrectly.  That  means  if  somebody asks,  he  gets  it.  If  nobody  asks,I guess nothing will  ever happen.  With that  understanding we shallproceed.  I believe  that  is  all  the  business we  have.  Do we  havelunch out  there?

[SECTION]

MR. ALTMANN.  Yes,  lunch  is  available  in  the  anteroom forGovernors and Presidents  and  those  who have been invited  to  stay.
