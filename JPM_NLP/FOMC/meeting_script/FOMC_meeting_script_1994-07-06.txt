CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Before we get  started on  our  formalproceedings,  I have  several  announcements.  First,  we'd like  towelcome  the new Vice Chairman  of  the Federal  Reserve Board  to hisfirst Federal  Open Market Committee  meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you very much.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And my next news--the unwelcome news--isthat  Si  Keehn is  leaving and this  is  his final  meeting.  It  says  herethat his  first  meeting was  on July 6, 1981.  Si,  of  course, willreturn  for the  retirement  luncheon  following  the August  16  meeting.This  is  also First Vice  President Bill  Conrad's  first meeting.  Billis  an  observer at  this meeting,  but he will  represent  the  Chicago Bankat  future meetings until  a new president is  selected.  Finally, KarlScheld will be attending his  last meeting.  He has been  attending FOMCmeetings regularly for  nearly 25  years.  I'd  like  to  say a few remarksabout Karl  at  the  luncheon  tomorrow.Getting  on to  formal  business,  would somebody like to  moveapproval  of  the minutes of  the May 17  meeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  I'd now like  to  turnto  Peter  Fisher  for  the  report  on  foreign currency operations.  Peter.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?  Ed.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  How much discretion did you have here workingwith the  Treasury in  terms of  the  timing  of  the  intervention?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  the  events of  the morning gave me preciouslittle  time.  The  final  decision  to  intervene was  not made untilsometime  between 9:15  and 9:30  a.m.  There had been an uptick in  thedollar shortly after  9:00  a.m.  I must  tell you I fear  that was  theresult of  some  leakage out  of  European central banks.  I was  verynervous  about trying to  enter  the market  as  the dollar was  coming downand thus  I was  in rather a hurry to  try to  get  into  the market beforeit  came off  that brief high.  So,  when  I did get approval  from theTreasury to  operate  in  that market,  I jumped right  in.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  And the  immediate response of marketparticipants was  to  sell dollars?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No,  I don't  think that was  the  immediateresponse.  The morning operation had a more  beneficial  effect.  Thedollar moved up--I  don't remember the  exact  figures  right now.  It7/5-6/94moved up appreciably over the  course of  an hour or  so.  It  then beganto  come off when we pulled out  of  the market  and in  the  afternoon whenwe  tried to  reinforce the dollar we  really met  a wall  of  dollar/marks.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  President  Boehne,  just  one  comment  on your firstquestion  from an historical perspective, which I think  is  theperspective you are  coming  from:  The decision to  intervene  on thatday was  a joint  decision,  so  in that  sense  Peter had no  discretion.That  is no  different  than it  has been.  But  once  the decision wastaken,  it  was then  largely in  the Desk's hands  as  to how  they wouldhandle  the  intervention.  That  was  in  contrast to  some  instances  ofmicro-management  over  the course  of recent years.  I think  Peter hadbeen given quite  a large amount  of  resources  for his potential  use,and  although he consulted about  his change  of  tactics,  the  tacticswere decided by the  Desk rather than by  the Treasury.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Reading  the  transcript  from the  last meeting--unfortunately these  transcripts will  come back to haunt us  all--but Iam going to  haunt you for  a moment,  if  I may.  [Laughter]  The  reasongiven for  the previous  intervention in late  April and early May wasthat  it  was  to underline a change in policy.  Was  there  any change  inpolicy  that  this  intervention underlined?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No, and I think that  may have been one  of  itsproblems.  I think when I spoke previously we were  referring  to  bothTreasury and Federal  Reserve policy.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Looking back at  last  week, I think  there was  achange  in  Treasury policy.  The  clarity with which it  was  expressedevolved over  the course  of  the week in which we operated and onlybecame clear,  I would say, toward the end  of  the  day and subsequently.There was  a change  in the  statements  Treasury officials were making.They were now looking  for  the  dollar  to  go higher  rather  than lower.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  The market's reaction to  that increasedclarity, as  I recall,  was to  send the  dollar  down.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't  think the  increased clarity was sendingthe  dollar down.  I really don't  view it  that way.  Late Fridayafternoon  an unnamed Treasury official  finally  said they would ratherhave the  dollar go  up  than down, not  in  so many words but  that was  thegist  of  it.  I don't  think that  caused the dollar  to  go down ratherthan up.  We  did have  a very regrettable  series  of  headlines  as  aresult  of  the  President's interview on  the  radio.  I think the overallremarks  the President made were something any rational person couldagree with.  They map rather well with remarks  I have made here  to  theeffect  that  there  are  fundamental  reasons  for  the mark and yen to bestrong but  that  their appreciation  is  getting  a little  overdone, andwe  think it  is  prudent to  intervene.  This  came  out  in  a series  ofheadlines.  The first  said  "Clinton thinks  exchange rates  arepuzzling."  And subsequent headlines were  "Clinton sees  reasons  for7/5-6/94versus  dollar."  Our  afternoon operations had to  face  these headlinesliterally  head-on.  That,  I think, was an  important  cause  of  thedollar's weakening  that  afternoon.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Did the Treasury know about  the  President'sforthcoming  statements?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I was  not aware of  the  President's  interviewprior  to  seeing it  come  across  the wire.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Was  the  President  aware  that we were going  tointervene?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't  know that  for  a fact.  I think he hadbeen briefed on the  Treasury's  views  on Thursday.  But  as  I said,  thefinal  decision to  intervene  was made by Secretary Bentsen between  9:15and 9:30  a.m. on Friday morning  for  their part.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I have  a follow-up question.  The transcriptfor the  last meeting reads  that  I was  asking you  "How long do  youexpect  the latest  intervention  to  hold?  I suppose  the  interventionlast August  bought us  9 or  10  months.  I assume the  secondintervention"--which we had  just had  in  late April  and early May--"will buy us  something  less  than 9 or  10  months."  It  bought us  fourweeks.  "Do we  have any ammunition  left?"  You said at  the May meeting"I think  the operation  and  the  action of  the  Bundesbank last  week andwhatever  the Committee  does  in  the  realm of  the  expected,  if  I can putit  that  way, will  tend to  stabilize  the dollar/mark rate."  Well, wedidn't stabilize  it.  How much  time has  this  intervention bought us?With the  last, we  went  from nine  to  ten months down to  four weeks.Will  this  intervention  buy us  four  hours  or  four minutes?  It boughtus  about  twenty minutes,  I think.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think it  has  bought us  more than  twentyminutes.  I wouldn't  tell you  it would buy us  any great amount  of  timein  terms  of  weeks or  months.  As  I said,  I do  think the relativestability of  dollar/yen in a trading level  below  100  is  very differentfrom what  all of  us  were expecting.  The  risk of  a drop  through thefloor at  that point,  I think, was very real;  dollar/yen  sentiment wasextraordinarily negative and there was very little  indication thatthere would be buyers  there.  Although there  is  a risk of  a big dropnow, I can't,  of  course, prove  that  to you scientifically.  But Idon't  think  it buys  us more  than a few weeks--I'll  be honest  with you,I don't  like to  admit  to  that--unless  there is  some  other change  inoversold now.  The  reaction of  the dollar/mark  last  week wasfrequently to  tick up  as nervous  people  covered shorts.  That was notthe case--we had not gotten  that  far--after  the  April-May operation.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Given  the interest  rate differential--this  isthe  last  question,  I promise--what  is your expectation of  the yen orDM exchange rate or  both a year  from now?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  You're  trying to make me  enjoy the  transcriptseven  less!  [Laughter]  I don't have any  forecast that  far out myself.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Higher  or  lower, how does  that  sound?7/5-6/94-4-

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I haven't  a clue.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Governor Lindsey, just  on your  first question,it  is  correct  to  say  that  one of  the purposes  of  the  May 4 operationwas  to  send a message.  That  doesn't necessarily mean that  the purposeof  every intervention should be  to  correct  a policy misperception.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Well,  Ted, I don't want  to dig it  out  of  thetranscript, but  I can swear  that  Chairman Greenspan, who I guess  isauthoritative  in  these matters,  said that  if  one were  to  list thereasons  for  intervening, underlining policy was  about  the  only reason.I will  find the  quote  for you.  It may be in  one  of  our Board meetingminutes, but if  I am substantively wrong, Mr. Chairman, please  correctme.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am not quite  certain what  you'veaccused me  of.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I was  accusing you of  being  quite correctactually in making the very wise  statement  that,  if  one  looks  toreasons  for  intervening, the most  legitimate reason  one  can think ofis  to underline a change  in policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There actually is  another that  isimportant,  and I think we have  intervened for  that  reason on  occasion.It  is  to  break a psychology that  is  building up  irrationally in  thehave  a constructive  effect.  That's  the  only meaningful use  ofintervention in  the context  of  unstable markets because  the  questionessentially  is whether  the  intervention will  accomplish something.The only way it  can do  something  is  to  catch  the market  short  andbreak the  back of  a cumulative  psychological downtrend.  We haveaccomplished that  on occasion when we  tried it  and sometimes  it  hasfailed.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  And would you view our  last attempt  as  successor  failure?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would say that  for  the last  attempt wedid not  have the benefit  of  a net  short position in the market.  Weknew that  at  the  time,  but we were at  a point where there were no  easysolutions.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  So,  the  intervention last  time didn't  meet yoursecond criterion?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would think not, but  I was  one ofthose  who supported  it,  so  I can tell  you that  I had my fingerscrossed;  I was hoping.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  You implied  in your comments  that you thoughtthere  was  a significant risk that  if  we had not  intervened, the bottomwould have dropped  out  of  the  dollar/yen relationship.  Was  there7/5-6/94anything going on in  the market  that  morning that  indicated adisorderly market?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  disorderly is  different  in one  contextfrom the  risk  of dropping  through a trap door.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I understand  that.  But an  estimate of risk isabsent  or  is  just speculation  in  a disorderly market  or at  thebeginning of  a disorderly market.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  on Thursday afternoon  and Friday morningof  that week I was  looking at  an  options position, which I included  inmy written material but  did not  include  in  the  charts  circulatedtoday.  I am referring to  risk reversals  which are  two  equally  "out ofthe money" options--one  dollar put  and one dollar  call.  The pricingis  expressed as  the  difference between the  implied volatility of  thetwo positions.  Now, when  the put  is  over the  call  in  "vols." weexpress  it  as  a minus  number;  when  the call  is  bid over  the  put, weexpress  it  as  a plus number.  From my entire  observation  of  thispricing, we have always  talked about  a range between  -1 and +1.Thursday afternoon and then  Friday morning,  the dollar put was  offeredat  2 "vols."  over the  call.  People who had never discussed optionsprices with me were  calling me up  on  the phone  to  make  sure I wasaware of  this pricing  development  that  suggested  that  the market  wasabout  to step  back and would not  want  to  touch dollar/yen as  the  ratedropped down.  So,  that's  as  precise an  indicator as  I had;  it  is  notthe  only one  that  I rely on  in  assessing market  sentiment,  whichobviously was  extraordinarily bearish.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I had a comment rather  than a question  if  thatis  in order, Mr. Chairman.  I just  have  to  say that  this  intervention,particularly  its outcome  or  lack  of  outcome, really bothered me a lot.I think just  about  everybody  saw it  as  a generally unsuccessfuloperation--maybe not  everybody but  most people.  It  got  a lot  ofattention  even  in  the Richmond papers.  The headline  on  the  front  pagethe next day was about  the  failure  of  this  operation.  What  concernsme  is  that  our  involvement  in such  a conspicuously unsuccessfuloperation  is  bound to  raise  questions  in  the  public's mind about  ourgeneral  effectiveness as  an institution,  about our ability to  do whatwe set  out  to do.  In  that  sense,  it  could tend  over  time  to  undermineor at  least weaken the  credibility of  our  longer-term monetary policyobjectives.  As  I see  it--I  think most people would agree  on  this--thebasic problem with sterilized intervention  operations  like this  one  isthat  the  short-term objectives  of  a particular operation may beperceived as  inconsistent with,  or  at  least not  fully consistent with,the broader  objectives of monetary policy at  a point in  time.  I thinkthis  shows pretty conclusively that  sterilized  intervention operationsonly have  lasting effects  if  the markets believe  they are going  to  bebacked up  strongly by basic  monetary policy actions.  Clearly, onexperience and others  like  it  in  the past, Mr. Chairman, I wouldrespectfully recommend that  to the best  of  our ability we avoidgetting involved in these  operations unless  there is  pretty generalagreement  within this  Committee  in  a particular instance  that we willback up  the  intervention with whatever monetary policy actions  arenecessary.  To  get  that kind of  agreement in  any particular case would7/5-6/94imply that  at  that  time  we would be  giving short-term exchange rateobjectives  a dominant  role  or at  least  a lot  of weight  in monetarypolicy.  With that  in mind I think that  we probably would not want  toundertake these  kinds  of  operations very often, which would be  a goodthing from my standpoint.  I think the  longer-term cost  of  operationslike  the  one  on June  24  is  significant.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You know, it  depends  really  on whetherwe  expect markets  to be wholly  efficient and not  run periodically intosome  significant  abnormalities  that  an intervention  could rebalance.This  is  the key  question.  You  are  telling me  that we  should notrespond  to  this  market at  all;  it's  the Treasury which has  to beconvinced of  that, which  they were not.  If we  are put  in  a positionwhere we opt  out  of  coordinating with the  Treasury, I think that  woulddo  the  financial  system more damage.  In  all  of  these  actions  it  hasbeen we who have  fended off  recommended  interventions which we  thoughtwere  superfluous  and potentially counterproductive.  We have only goneforward when we  thought  there was  at  least a reasonable shot.  Ourchoice  is  not,  in my judgment,  to withdraw from these  discussionsbecause  the  damage  it  could do  to  the  financial  system  if  we areperceived to be  at  loggerheads with  the Treasury in  this  sort  ofarrangement,  I think, would be  very  substantial.  If  you are asking mewhether  I personally disagree with  the underlying philosophy that youwere  outlining,  the answer  is,  no,  I do  not;  I do  agree.  The  questionis what  do we  do  about  it.  What we  are  trying to  do  is  to make  thefinancial  system, in  the  context of  the  structure  in which we have  tooperate,  as  sensible  as we can make  it or  less  nonsensible,  if  I canput  it  in double  negatives.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Well,  I certainly respect your view, Mr.Chairman.  I just hope  that what  I perceive as  a significant  cost  ofan outcome  like  this  one  gets  factored into  the  equation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Could I just  go back to  the  discussion we werehaving  a few moments  ago about  the more generic  exchange rate policy?This  may be  a rookie question, but  I am highly uninformed.  I thoughtthe  generic policy was  that we did not  intervene very much but  that wedid intervene  to  correct  "disorderly markets."  This might betranslated as  saying we  sometimes  try to prick speculative bubbles;different  people would translate  it  different ways.  That  is  to  say,it  is  not  that  we  intervene  only when there  is  a change in policy tobe signaled.  This  basically has been the policy  of  the United StatesTreasury for  a long time,  and I would have thought we viewed  the  lastoperation as  a continuation of  that  long-term policy.  There was  achange  in  rhetoric, I would admit--

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  As  the  Chairman said, there were no shorts  inthe market;  we  weren't pricking anything speculative.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  You could argue  that  implicit  in what you  justsaid  is  an argument that  the operation  was doomed  to  fail.  I don'tthink that was quite  so  obvious before  the  fact.  But  it  seems  to methe  effort was predicated on the  belief  that  there was  a downwardspeculative bubble and that  it  was at  least possible  to prick it  or  toprevent  it  from getting worse.  Peter  suggested, contrary to  theevaluation that  it was  a failure, which  I tend to  share  myself, that7/5-6/94-7-you could look at  it  as  a success  in  that  the  floor has not droppedout  of  the yen.  But  the main point  I wanted to  make was  not about  thespecifics  of  the  tactics but that  I didn't  really see  that the  long-term generic  exchange rate policy of  the United States government wasas you described it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I'd  like  to make  some  comments  intwo  areas:  One is  on  the  operation itself because,  like  the Chairman,I was  involved  in the  decision to  do  it.  The previous Friday at  aboutmidday, as  Peter mentioned in his prepared statement, there had been avery significant weakening of  the  dollar on no volume.  We had what  istechnically the worst  of  all worlds:  a price correction with noposition correction.  So we had all  the people who didn't  feel  goodabout  the  dollar sitting  there with  exactly or  essentially the  samepositions that  they had at  the  start  of  the day.  On  the particularFriday morning when we  intervened, the market had very much the  samefeel  about  it.  The question, which  always plagues  one  after anintervention as  it  should whether it  is  successful  or not,  is  whatwould have happened if  we had not  intervened.  The  answer is we don'tknow.  But  the  likelihood of  the dollar  having been considerablyweaker is  significant  in my view.  I would agree with Peter's commentthat  the  ability of  the  dollar to  stay  in  the 98ish area  against  theyen since  that  time had a relationship, perhaps  the  main beneficialone, with  the  intervention  itself.  Secondly, I think we  shouldrealize  that  the dollar's weakness  is  essentially against  the yen.The  dollar/deutschemark is  about  in  the middle  of  a range within whichit  has been  floating for  some  considerable number  of months.  So,having made  the policy statement  to  accompany the  intervention,  Ithink people  are now correctly thinking  that  the  main thing going onin the  exchange market  is  that we  have  a very strong Japanese yen andthat's  a very big problem for  the  macro  economy in Japan.On  the policy  issue,  I very strongly support  the Chairman'sview that  it  would be  unwise,  I think in  the  extreme,  for  the FederalReserve  to  distance itself  from active  involvement  in  theworld does not  know until  the next  quarterly publication of ourexchange market activity by Peter as  the Manager  for ForeignOperations whether the  intervention by the U.S. monetary authoritieshas  involved both the Treasury and the  Fed or  just  one  or just  theother.  So,  in  order to  establish that  we were not  involved in  theoperation,  since the  Federal  Reserve Bank of  New York carries  outintervention operations  as  the  fiscal  agent of  the  Treasury, we wouldhave to make a public  statement that  we did not  sympathize with  anaction by our own government.  That  is  something which I do  not  thinkany of us  would wish  to do,  at  least  I certainly would not.  Theability of  those of  us  involved in  these discussions  to  have a verypositive  influence on  the  Treasury is  considerable.  They payattention to  us.  I think they believe  that both  our knowledge  ofeconomics  and of markets  is  considerable;  we hope that  belief  is well-founded but  the  important thing  is  that  that  is what  they  appear tothink.  Therefore, we  do  have a considerable amount of  influence onwhat happens.  The Chairman and I have  both stated that we  supportedthe  operation on  that day.  It  does  not  appear  to  have been a success,but  again we do  not have a clue  as  to what would have happened had wenot  intervened.7/5-6/94-8-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I can agree with everything  the Vice Chairmanand  the Chairman  just said and still  feel uncomfortable  with thisparticular operation.  Let me  first ask Peter  a follow-up question tothe  response he gave  to Governor Lindsey about  the  100  level on  theyen  and a floor  and so  on.  Now,  the rate  is  something under  99  andthe market  is  still  functioning.  Is  there  another number that'smagic?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't  think there  is  one  that  has  anythingapproaching  the magic  quality or  aura of the  100  level.  I think thatthe  market  looks  to  95.50--actually  95--as  a sort  of  floor;  this  isthe  view of  the  chartists of  the world.  That  level would representthe  bottom of  the dollar/yen rate going back to  the early 1960s,taking the  troughs  over  that period;  people with their rulers  can drawa line to  there.  That  level  has  some  significance  for  the market, butnothing approaching the  significance of  100.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Part  of  the  reason I asked the question was  thatone  of  the  things  that  troubles me  is  taking action because  of  apsychological barrier.  The market participants now say, well  okay,that  level  is  not going  to  come back again,  so as  far as  magicnumbers--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Jerry, could  I just  say--I  think theTreasury was acutely aware  that what  they did not want to  do was  toprotect  the  100  level.  In  fact,  they have  often made statements  tothe  effect  that  if we  could close  our eyes  and all  of  a suddenreadjust  the  number  to  under 100  they would feel a lot  morecomfortable than  trying to  defend that number.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  But  Peter argued it wasn't  our  view or  even theTreasury's.  Rather this was  in  the  minds of  the participants  in the

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  That  was creating  this  situation that  forced ourhand.  And  if  it  was, we might  call  it  irrational.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  the dollar had traded below  100  earlier inthe  week and that was  indeed one  of  the reasons why we didn't  operatethen  and why we  felt  somewhat more  comfortable--though  I think it'sfair to  say not  greatly so--about  operating at  that point,  havingapproached the  100  level  for  the  third or  fourth time.  First,  therate went  through  that  level and  then it  came  back.  And  so  some  ofthe  psychological  aspects  of operating  close  to  100,  but above  it,were  removed.  That  does not remove  the point  that  Peter made aboutpossible  consequences of  a  large adjustment below that  in  the absenceof  any actions  by the monetary  authorities.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The dollar had traded briefly below 100  inrather discrete increments  and we  had all  seen  99  on the  screenseveral  times;  it  did not  stay there very long.  So,  it  was a sort ofepisodic venturing below 100.7/5-6/94-9-

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Focusing on your reference  to  marketparticipants,  the magic number, and psychological aspects,  I want  tofollow-up on  something that Al  Broaddus was  referring to--theperception of  success  or  failure.  In  a technical  sense,  it doesn'tmatter  to me  whether you sell  $800  million of  assets denominated inyen and deutschemarks  and Joan Lovett rather mechanically buys  assetsdenominated in U.S.  dollars  of  the  same  amount  in order  to maintainthe  funds  rate.  So,  what happens  is  that  the  Fed is  just going  tomake  the portfolio  substitution.  But  people don't  see  Joan's actions;they  see  your actions.  Suppose  the perception  is  that  our objectivewas  to  influence the  rate--that we  had a price objective  and weretrying  to prevent  the  dollar  from falling further or  to  cause  it  torise, not  trying to  do  something as  Governor Blinder mentioned aboutdisorderly markets.  But  the dollar now is not  consistent with theobjective.  If  we have  a repetition of  those,  it  makes  the  FederalReserve  look impotent  because markets  see  what  Peter  does  but  they donot  see what  Joan does.  And if  we have  several  of  those over aperiod, our  image of  being able to  influence markets will  betarnished.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  This  is  a question for  either Peter or  Ted.  Thequestion is  whether you are  concerned  about the  extent  to which  ourcurrent account deficit  has been financed recently through centralbank intervention and, as  a practical  matter, how closely we  canmonitor that.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  I have some words  in  the  Chart  Show onthis point.  The extent  to  which our deficit has  been financedrecently by official  sources  is  exaggerated because basically all  thatcounts is  the  intervention by  the major industrial  countries.  Morethan half  of  the  financing last  year,  say, was  by nonindustrialcountries whose motives  are  the  same  as  those  of  any other privatesector investor;  they don't have  an exchange rate motive  though theyaccurately because, this  is  the second leading point,  we  don't reallyknow why what  gets  recorded as  official  inflows  are official  inflows.For  example,  if  a country moves  its  dollar holdings  from the  Euro-of our  current account  deficit  even though in  some  sense in aportfolio preference way and a currency dimension way, it would not beany change.  So,  it  is  very difficult  to  interpret  all  those numbers.We have  lots  of  countries  around the world that have  differentmotivations  for where  they hold their  assets  and why they hold themthere.  That's  about  all  I have  to  offer.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  one  argues  that  the  exchange rate isaffected by the proportion of  the current account deficit  that  isfinanced on official  account,  the  implication is  that  sterilizedintervention affects  the  exchange rate.  I would argue strongly aboutthat because  a goodly part of  our  official  support  is  coming  from theJapanese;  they are  in  the market every day, just picking up $100million, $200  million,  $500  million, and  I think the  evidence thatthey are  affecting the exchange rate  is very dubious.  It's  showing upin  our accounts because,  to  the  extent  that they  are picking upTreasury bills  and the  like  directly, the  issue  that  Ted  is  raising isnot  a problem.  But  to  the extent  that  they are picking up  dollars  in7/5-6/94-10-the  Euro-dollar market--I  don't  think  there is  much evidence thatthere  are  a lot  of  Euro-dollar holdings  in Japanese  reserve accounts--then it  appears basically in  the private  account, not  in  thegovernment account.  So,  my main concern about  that  argument  is  thatit  gives  credence to  sterilized  intervention as  an  important  tool  instabilizing  the  exchange  rate.  I don't  think the  evidence is  there.Governor Lindsey has  another  question.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  This  is  really  for Don Kohn, but  it  is  relatedto  the  foreign exchange  operations  and I wanted to  pick up  on a pointthat Bill  McDonough mentioned.  Suppose  we had a change  in pricewithout any change  in position.  Let us  just  imagine  somethingcatastrophic--and for  the  recording of  this meeting this  is  justhypothetical--suppose we had a drop  to  85  in  the  yen, to pick a nicelow round number, what  would be the  reaction?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Joan  can comment  on  this  as well,  but  I think  theexperience of  the  last month or  so  is  that  the  bond markets would tendto  react negatively.  That  is,  they would be  concerned about  one  oftwo  things:  One,  that  the  decline  in  the dollar/yen  relationship wasitself  indicative  of  inflation  expectations, and that might end upaffecting the  bond markets.  Or,  two,  that  in  fact  a very rapidlysinking dollar,  given where  the  economy  is  and  the  strength ofaggregate  demand, would have  inflationary implications  via directprice  and indirect  aggregate  demand channels.  So,  I think at  leastover  the recent period,  the decline  in  the  dollar has had an  adverseeffect  on  bond markets.  We have had periods  in which the dollar hasfallen and  there has been no effect  on bond markets, but  that  hasoccurred in the  context  of much more slack in  the economy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  is  also the  implication that  thedollar will  continue  to decline.  If  we  get a sharp  reduction andeveryone thinks  it  is  overdone,  the bond market will rally.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That  would be my reaction, and that  shows why Iam not  on Wall  Street, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  that has  happened.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I would  think we'd have  a big rally  in the bond

[SECTION]

MS. LOVETT.  How the  bond market  is  going  to respond willdepend  on  the circumstances  that  caused  such an abrupt  change and whatthat  does  to the expectations  and how long it  persists.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think you would have to have  a sense of  howconfident  the market was that  it would stay at  85  or whether the nextstop was 75.  Now, if  you were  confident  that  it  was  stopping there,  Iwould agree with your  hypothesis for  a rally in the  bond market;  thatwould be  a plausible reaction.  But  if  the market did not  haveconfidence it  was  going to  stop  at  85,  I don't  think we would get muchof  a rally in  the bond market.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  But  that's  a problem in  itself.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  if we have  any confidence  that markets  canbe stabilizing  factors--I picked 85  because  I was  trying  to  take a7/5-6/94-11-worst  case  scenario  of  the  dollar/yen  fall  and I thought  85  was  so  lowthat  the  rate would not  get  there--wouldn't we view a fall  to  such alevel  as  the  foundation  for  a rally in  the bond market?  I would thinkthe  answer  is  yes.  So,  I would say that  if  the markets want  tooverstep  themselves  and they are  going  to  overstep  themselvesirrationally, why not  let  them?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I haven't  said anything  about  irrationality.I'd  like  the meeting tape  to  be very clear  on that because  I don'tthink people betting millions  and billions  of  dollars  are doinganything  irrational.  They are trying  to  serve  their interests  as  theysee  them in  the short  run.  That's  very important  to me.  That's  thequestion,  though.  I look at  asset prices  and I see  that  as prices  goup,  demand goes  up  in  the short  run and  as prices  go  down, demand goesdown  in  the  short run.  And whether  the markets  are  stabilizing or notdepends  on  where the  short run  ends  and  the  long  run begins.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Since there  weren't any questions about  theimmediate  strategy, could  I ask a  longer-run  question about  thematurity structure  strategy?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Of  the  System's portfolio?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Yes.  As  I look at  the report,  since  the  lastmeeting  I see  that  the System  added about  $5 billion  in bills.  Andwhen  I look  at  the  notes and bonds,  it's  a sort  of  swap.  That's  theoutcome  for  the  whole  six-week period as  was  described in  the  table inyour report.  Should I read anything  into  that?  Or  could you  justtalk  for my benefit, as  a newcomer, about  the maturity  structure  ofthe  System's portfolio  and  the Committee's policy regarding  it?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Let me  start  out by  saying  that  when we makeadditions  to  the portfolio  on  a permanent  basis,  we usually do  so  whenwe  see a protracted need  to  supply  reserves.  If  we really don't seethat,  if  it  looks  as  if  there  are  going to  be  short-term swings,  wewill  address  most  of  that  reserve need with repurchase  agreements  andthe  like.  I don't  know what page of  the  report you have  in  front  ofyou, but  during the  intermeeting--

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I was  looking at  Roman numeral  IV of  yourreport.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  The New York Desk report?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Okay.  On  an outright basis,  the portfolio wentup by  $4-1/4 billion during  the  period.  That  increase  reflected$3-3/4  billion of  bill purchases  in the market  and  securitiespurchased directly  from  foreign accounts  that  were essentially allbills.  The  data you  see  in  the middle of  that  table  partly reflectthe exchange  that  took place at  the  end of  last week when  therefunding  settled, so  it's  a wash;  it  doesn't  count  as  an  increase.It's  just  an  exchange of  notes  and bonds  that  matured in May, not newpurchases.  Most of  the  increase  in  the portfolio over  theintermeeting period came  in Treasury bills, virtually all  of  it.  Forthe  year to  date  our holdings  are up  $16  billion  and  that  has been,  insome  sense,  almost evenly  distributed between  coupons  and bills.  Wehave been  looking to  keep  the average maturity of  the portfolio prettyclose  to  the  level  where  it  was  last  year.  We  are  not  aiming toshorten  it  or  to  lengthen  it very much.  There was a view in earlieryears  that  the portfolio  should be  somewhat  shorter, but we reached aconclusion about  a year or  so  ago  that  the  amount of  liquidity in  theportfolio  is  probably appropriate  for current  circumstances.Basically, we  try to  keep  it pretty much at  about  the  38-month averagereached last  year.  The  reason  for doing the  acquisitions  in  the billalready had made some  additions  on the  coupon  side earlier.

MR. TRUMAN.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Revisions  of  individual member  forecasts

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  have  tentatively  indicated  that  next Monday,reassessing  the members'  forecasts.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Messrs.  Prell  or Truman?

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I have  one.  I'm not  sure  this  is  quite  theright place.  In  the Greenbook,  there  was  a discussion or  intimationthat we are  starting to  see more  inflows  into  bond funds  and  stockfunds.  Could you comment  a little more  on that?  Maybe that  should beaddressed to  you, Don, I don't  know.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We  had outflows  from bond funds mostly in March.That  situation stabilized and subsequently we had  some  small  netinflows.  Inflows  to  the  stock mutual  funds  actually were quitestrong.  However,  the data  received as  the Bluebook was  going to pressor perhaps  shortly  thereafter showed  that  in  the most recent  week bothstock and bond  funds were weaker.  There were outflows  in all  of  thoseaccounts.  But  our  assessment  is  that  the  initial  shock of  the  upwardmovement  in  long-term rates  and the  downward movement  of  the  stockwere surprised--in  the ensuing  four  to  six weeks.  Looking forward, wewould expect  continued  flows  to those  funds,  but  at much lower  levelsthan in  1992  and  1993  on  the presumption  that people  have learnedtheir lesson;  they now are recognizing  those are  riskier assets  thanperhaps  they thought  before.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  What  about money market mutual  funds?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Initially,  they had very  large  inflows  in  theperiod in which the bond funds  had the  outflows.  But  since  then, theyhave cooled  down quite  substantially;  their pluses match bond fundminuses reasonably well.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  A  question for Mike  and one  for  Ted:  Mike,regarding  the growth  of potential  output,  when you look  at  labor  forcegrowth,  is  there no  longer  a decline in  hours worked?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Do you mean  in the  longer-term trend  in  theworkweek?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Yes.7/5-6/94-14-

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It's not apparently  obvious  in  the very recentdata, but  our presumption is  that  eventually we will  see that  occur.In  the  forecast,  we have  the workweek shortening  in  the near  term fromits  very high recent  level  and not changing a great  deal thereafterthrough  the  forecast period.  Our  assumption is  that  perhaps  there hasbeen  some  interruption of  the  prior  trend as  companies may tend,particularly with  fringe benefit  costs  being as  considerable as  theyare  and with  the  possibility of  incurring costs  to  fire  someone  and soon, to  keep  the workweek a bit  longer  than we  certainly wereanticipating  at  the beginning of  this  year.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  So,  it's not  a major  factor  in  the calculation ofpotential  output  growth?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It's  a small  factor.  There are  a number  of  smallfactors we  have  taken  account of  in getting  from the  nonfarm businesssector to  GDP.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Ted, this  isn't directly affecting the  UnitedStates  all  that much, but  I refer  to your  table on Chart  7 with regardto  China.  One of  the  issues,  of  course,  for  those who  follow China iswhether  or not  they are  going to  be  successful  in dealing with  theireconomic  overheating problem.  I am  trying to  figure  out  from yourforecast whether  they  in  fact will  succeed  in  controlling it.  Itlooks  to me  as  though  they have  not had great  success  thus  far.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think  that's  right.  It's not  clear how muchthey  need to  do  in  order  to  have  great  success.  They have  taken someof  the bloom off  but not  a lot.  Their  expansion is  running close  todouble-digit rates.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  It  would be  interesting, maybe not  so  much forthis  Committee, to  look at  the  implications.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think  that's one of  the  factors--a good point.If  China were more successful,  or  if  the  cost  of  that  success were  5percent growth rather  than 10  percent  growth, the  implications  forJapan and  the  other Asian countries might not  be  entirely negative.There would be a risk.  Definitely the  Japanese will  tell you,  as  Ithink I have  commented in other briefings,  that  they  consider slowergrowth in China  to be  one  of  the  uncertainties and risks in  theirforecasts.  So  bad news  for China  is  good news  for Japan.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Right.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I have  a couple  of questions  for Mike.  In yourinitial  oral  presentation, you  remarked on  the role  of  long-terminterest rates  at  current  levels  in maintaining growth of  realeconomic  activity in  line with the  economy's potential.  You mightrecall  that we had a discussion at  the May meeting about the  linkagesin  the model  of  short rates  to  long rates  to  residential  andnonresidential  investment, measures  of  aggregate demand, inflation  andinflation expectations.  In  this month's  Greenbook, on page  I-2  ofpart  I relating  to  key assumptions, that  same  idea  is  back again.  Iwant  to see  if  I understand what  this  says.  The  sentence I want  tofocus  on  says  that  "maintenance of  adequate  overall  financial7/5-6/94-15-restraint,"  and  I take  that  to mean  long-term  interest rates,  "thusseems  likely to  require  at  least  some  further tightening of  moneyand long-term bond yields  are  the  indicator of  the  thrust  of policyactions.  Am  I correct  in  interpreting this  to  mean that  if  we were  tomaintain the  current  funds rate,  long-term bond yields would  fall,possibly significantly?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The reference  to  financial  restraint  was  intendedto  have  a broader meaning, encompassing all  interest  rates  and alsothe nonrate  terms  of  lending.  As  I noted in my presentation, we thinkthat  one  ingredient  in  the  current  situation is  a pretty substantialshift  in  credit  availability from banks  and, to  some  extent,  otherintermediaries.  That,  in effect,  has provided perhaps  over  the pastyear  some  significant  incremental  stimulus.  I wouldn't want  to  try toquantify it,  but  it  has been in  an expansive direction.  To  yourspecific point,  there  are  several  things  one needs  to  consider  inthinking  about  the  long-term path.  One  that  I referred tospecifically in  my remarks was  the  notion  that  there  is  a considerableliquidity premium, probably larger recently than it  was  earlier, inthe  term  structure  and that, under calmer conditions  in  the markets,one  might expect  that  to  diminish somewhat.  It's  that  in particularthat  I was  referring to as  a rationale  for  thinking that  some  rise  inshort-term rates would be  necessary.  Now, getting  to  the  broadercyclical dynamics  of  this,  if  the  Fed did not tighten  as  assumed hereunder the  conditions  that  we have perceived to  be  prevailing in  theeconomy, at  least  two  things  I can  think of might happen.  One  is  thatso-called credibility might be diminished if  there  is  a broadeningperception that we  are behind the  curve  at  some point and that we arenot  exerting anti-inflationary restraint.  The  inflation premium  inrates  might  rise.  The other possibility is  that  it  comes about  moreautomatically in  that  we  are  too  stimulative,  aggregate  demand isstronger, pressures  arise ultimately in  the  economy which tend  to pushup rates,  and if  we  didn't tighten  at  that phase,  then we  would begetting  this  inflation premium generated in  the  rates.  It's  a complexissue.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Well,  I guess  I am more  puzzled than before!

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That might qualify me  for  elevation  to a higherlevel  position!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  But  a liquidity premium can come out  from eitherend  of  the yield  curve, and you're  trying to  stay away from  sayingthat if  we don't raise  the  funds  rate,  long-term rates will  fall  orthat the yield curve  flattened  from the  long  end because  of  the shortrate.  But at  the May meeting, there was a lot  of discussion  about  a4-1/4  versus  4-1/2  percent  funds  rate, policy neutrality and all  ofthis,  and  some  uncertainty about  that.  Now, we have  a much strongerstatement  in both  the  Greenbook and Bluebook that policy neutrality is5-1/4  percent.  What  changed between May and now that  it went  fromsome uncertainty as  to whether  it  is  4-1/4  or 4-1/2,  and now it  is5-1/4  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  there  is  no  greater certainty attached tothe  relationships  in  this  forecast  as we perceive them  than  there wasin  the prior forecast.  The major  changes were a result,  I think,  ofchanges primarily in  so-called exogenous  factors.  We have  a higher7/5-6/94-16-oil  price;  we have  a lower  dollar, with  the likelihood of  there beingsome  greater pressure  coming  through  import price  channels  and so  on.We  also have  a somewhat  lower unemployment  rate with all  theadjustments we  care to  make  that  suggest  that  the  economy is  at  asomewhat higher level  of  resource utilization and has more  of  atendency to pass  these  kinds  of  shocks  through  to  the  generalinflation  rate.  We  also  had a stronger sense  about this  liquiditypremium effect after  we  saw what happened when we announced our policyconfirming what we  had thought was going  on.  All  of  these  things  ledus  to raise  the  short-term rate  assumption,  I'd say moderately,certainly relative to  what  seems  to  be  built in  in  terms  of  marketexpectations,  at  least after  1994.  We  have rates peaking  out  at  theend  of  this year,  leveling out,  whereas  the market  seems  to anticipatefurther  tightening.  Our  judgment  is  that  this will  be enough  to  bringabout  the moderation  in aggregate demand  that we  forecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Cathy Minehan, weren't you appointedacting president  recently?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  No.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  When did I dream that?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I think  that was  a reading by some newspapersof  the  wording in  the  Federal Reserve Act--in  the  absence  of  thepresident, the  first vice  president  is  the  acting  chief executiveofficer.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I call  on First  Vice President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  My question is  very much the  same,  and I knowthere's a risk  in  comparing  a range  of  forecasts  arrived at  in verydifferent  ways with a particular or  specific  forecast.  But  justcomparing  the  central  tendency to the  staff's  projections next year,the  staff  seems  to  be  on  the  low side vis-a-vis  real  GDP  and  on  thehigh side  vis-a-vis unemployment.  That  leads me  to  the question ofwhat  happened and what  do we get by not  tightening the  full  100  basispoints  that you talk about  in  your Greenbook.  Does  that  simply workon  the  inflation side  or  does  it work elsewhere?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  There are  two questions  that you've  raised.You're certainly  correct  that  there's  a symmetry here.  We have aslower  growth rate  in  1995  than the  central  tendency, and we have  ahigher unemployment rate.  I might note  that we're  sort  of  at  the  lowend of  the  overall  range  for growth, and at  the high  end of  theoverall  range  for unemployment.  So  there's  certainly a consistencyhere.  We  come  out with an  inflation rate well within the  range.  Ididn't  think  there was  a great deal  here  fundamentally to  make a pointabout--

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It's  sort  of  a lead-in  to what  do we  get  if  wedon't  tighten?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  If  you don't  tighten, the  effects  are  likely  tobe very modest  on inflation  even through  1995.  A difference  of  100basis points would have  a fractional  effect on  the  level of  real  GDPover  that  forecast period and a very small,  almost  imperceptible,7/5-6/94-17-effect  on inflation unless we  get  out of  this  some distinctlydifferent kind  of  path for  long rates  than we have  talked about.  Thatcould throw  in  some additional  variation in  the  outcome.  Butbasically, the  100  basis point  increase  in  the  funds  rate  would have  arather moderate effect  on  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think it  depends,  as  I indicated  in mycomments,  on what  you  assume  about  the  dollar,  the  reaction  of  otherrates,  and what  else  is  going  on at  the  same  time.  If  the  100 basispoints  were  to  cause a  several  percent  lower dollar,  then because  ofthe  direct price effects  you would get  the price  effects much sooner.And, of  course, you'd have much stronger economic  activity.  On  theother hand,  the dollar  could--for  lack of  a better word--"levitate."

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I  think the prospect would be  an only  slightlyperceptible  upward tilt  to  the inflation  rate  rather  than  this  flatpath  that we have,  if  you  simply  isolated in the  standard way that  100basis  point difference  in the  funds  rate.  But we also have  beensensitive to  these  expectational  considerations.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  other point  I would make,  President Minehan,is  that  the Bluebook  had tighter  alternatives,  a no changealternative, and no  easier  alternative.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We  ran simulations with  the  funds  rate  flat,  andas Mike  said, we  didn't get  much effect  on  inflation by the  end  of1995,  but  the unemployment  rate was  significantly  lower.  Given ourassumption about where  the NAIRU was, we  started getting an  uptick ininflation by  1995  and more noticeably  in  1996  and  1997.  We assumedthat  the  Committee had  a strong presumption against  that  increase  ininflation occurring, so  we  didn't  include  this  alternative.Obviously, aggregate  demand is  also  a consideration;  if  aggregatedemand is  weaker  than  in the  staff  forecast,  the  funds  rate  can  staythe  same.  Actually, that  simulation  indicates  lower  inflation.  Butgiven the  staff's  aggregate demand projection  and  its  assessment  ofpotential, we had  some  significant  effects  in 1996  and  1997.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I have  two  questions.  I had one when  I put myhand up,  and now I have two.  The  first was  for  Ted about  the  forecastfor  central Europe.  As you well  know,  there was  a notable  feature ofthe  OECD  forecast  that  went  out yesterday--the question of  to  whatextent  was Germany especially, and  Europe  generally, relying onselling to  the United  States  to  get  the  growth  that  the OECD  forecast.I can't  remember if  yours  is  higher or  lower because one  is  Q4-to-Q4and  the other  is  year-over-year,  but  this  forecast  has a weaker  U.S.economy  than the  OECD forecast  and  it  also has a  lower dollar.  Couldyou  say something  about  to what  extent  the  growth  in Germany andcentral  Europe  is  export-led  in  the  staff's  forecast?

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  two points:  The answer  is  that  it  isexport-led in  the  sense  that  our assumption  about Germany  is  that  netexports will be a positive  factor in  their  growth.  I think we have  alittle  less  growth overall,  and a little  less  growth in  net exportsfor Germany than the  OECD.  I know that  we  do  for  the OECD  countries7/5-6/94-18-other  than Germany.  So  that's  the  answer  for  the  second half of  thatquestion.  We are a  little  less  optimistic  than they are  in  thatregard.  They are  all  in  the  same  ballpark, but  they  show a littlemore growth this  year and a  little  more next year.  And  that'ssomewhat  consistent with  the  fact  that we have  somewhat  lower U.S.growth  so  there  is  less  impetus  coming  from outside  than  in  theirforecast.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Secondly,  I'd  just  like  to pick up  on  thequestion  that Cathy Minehan was  addressing to  Mike Prell.  Quantifyingthe  difference  between  100  basis  points  on  the  funds  rate between nowand December, and say  0 or  25  or  50  basis points  or  something--say 0--would I be wrong  to  think that  the  effect  on  the  1995  fourth-to-fourthquarter growth  rate  would be  in  the  range  of  1/2  percentage point?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think our  model, which  is  reasonably interestsensitive,  and with the  normal  rather  sluggish  adjustment  of  longrates,  which would be questionable, would  show less  than that  over  thecourse  of  1995.  But your  order of magnitude would not  be  far  off.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mike,  I may have misunderstood you, but whenJerry Jordan asked you why  there was  this  100  basis point  shift  inyour  assumption, you  said  that  exogenous  factors  had changedincluding,  for  example,  the price  of  oil.  Now, this  could just  beanother  experiment.  If  a Mideast war broke  out  tomorrow  and the priceof  oil  went up  $20  a barrel,  would you recommend that  we  raiseinterest  rates?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It  would depend  on your  objectives,  short run  andlonger  run.  I think there  would be  a  significant  inflation jolt  inthe  short  run.  Your policy dilemma would be  to  prevent  that  fromtending  to  flow through  into an  ongoing inflation process  where  it  hadits  initial price  level  impact but  then perhaps  got  built  into wageincreases  and broader  inflationary expectations.  You would need toraise  the unemployment  rate  substantially above  the prior  level  thatyou  thought  acceptable  in  order  to get  you back on what  you thoughtwas  an appropriate  inflation path.  I  think we would lay out  theoptions  in  that way.  I think we'd have  a hard time deciding  exactlywhat  forecast  design  to present  to you.  We would probably work  towarda compromise  scenario  that  you could then assess  to  decide whether youwanted  to be  tighter  or  easier.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Nominal  GDP  is  unchanged in  the  forecast--essentially unchanged.  In order  to  get  that  result--to have virtuallythe  same nominal  GDP as we  had before--you  are  telling us  we have toraise  interest  rates  100  basis points,  and  that's  because of  exogenousfactors?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The nominal  GDP  forecast  is  .3 of  a percenthigher  in 1994  and  .2 percent higher  in  1995.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I was  looking  at  Chart  16  in  the Chart  Show.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  So, you are  going back to  the January  forecast?7/5-6/94-19-

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I see;  the previous  estimate  is  the Januaryforecast?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes,  I am  sorry;  we tried  to make  thiscomparable.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  going back to  these  exogenous  factors--

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Right.  The change  in our  assumption  from  thelast  Greenbook  is  3/4  percentage  point.  I regard all  of  this almoston  the order  of  hair splitting  given  the uncertainties, but  certainlywe wrestled with it  and it  gives  some meaningful  indication  of wherewe  think  things  need to  go.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  it would be your view or  the  model's viewthat  an exogenous  shock, such  as  leaving monetary  conditionsunchanged, would raise  nominal  GDP?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  If  the price of  oil  went  up, you'd have  ahigher  nominal  GDP  level?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  If  policy accommodated it.  Certainly,  if  youheld the  funds  rate,  which  is  in  an extremely accommodative posture  inthe  face  of  that  kind  of  shock, you would have  astronomical GDPgrowth.  But let  me note,  for  example,  that  there  was  a  footnote  inthe Greenbook reporting on  a partial  simulation of  an  exchange  rateshock.  I  think  it  was  about  three  times what we have  in  terms  of  theforecast  change,  but  that's  a reference point  for you.  I  think youwould see  it  is  in general  terms  consistent with  the  kind ofadjustment  that  we have  incorporated in this  forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I would also  note  that  in the  last Greenbook, andin my presentation, we  emphasized  that we  thought  the risks  were  thatit  was going  to  take  higher rates  than our  assumption rather  thanlower rates.  So  in  a  sense, mentally, the adjustment  isn't  even quitethe  3/4  percent  that we made.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  To  come back to  Governor  Blinder's questionabout  the  forecast  for  Germany,  I just now recall  that  our outlook  foryear-over-year growth  in Germany is  almost  exactly the  same  for  1995as  the OECD's,  though  in general we  tend to  be a smidgen weaker.However, OECD put  their  outlook together before  they had  the first-quarter numbers.  My guess  is  they would probably have  a  strongeroutlook, everything else being equal,  just  the way one  averages.  Now,that  may be made  up  from the  fact  that  they do have  a bit  strongergrowth next year,  so  they average  out.  But  it's  about  the same  forGermany.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I need to  ask Don and Mike  for  a  clarification.When you were  answering questions  earlier about  the  fact  that  youassumed a higher  short-term rate,  Don, you said that  in terms  ofaggregate  demand you had different  alternatives  including  maintaining7/5-6/94-20-the  same rate  or  changing the rate.  What were some  of  the  factorsthat went  into  the  picture?  As you have  it  here,  the  staff  forecastmust presume  a fairly  strong growth rate without  this increase  inshort-term rates.  What were the  factors  in  terms  of your aggregatedemand  forecast  that you considered  in making this assumption of  ahigher  rate?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Are  you talking  about  the  alternative  simulationin  the Bluebook or  simply why we raised the assumption in  theGreenbook forecast?

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Why you raised the  assumption.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Well,  as  I said,  I think the major  considerationwas  how we could in  essence  cap  the  inflation rate  close  to  where  ithas  been in  the  face  of  these shocks.  Implicitly,  also,  I think weprobably have  incorporated a sense of  a little  stronger underlyingaggregate  demand.  We're not  talking  about  a vast difference,  but  thereal  GDP path in  this  forecast  is  little  changed from  that  in  the  lastforecast.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  And that's  taking  into  account  in your  model  theeffects  of  the  moves  to  this  point?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That's right.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  And so you  still  see  continued stronger growth?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Basically what we have here  with the  dollardepreciation and the  stronger growth  abroad  is more  impetus  comingthrough  the external  sector, which we  have  essentially offset  throughhigher  interest  rate  effects  on  domestic demand.  That's  the  simpleversion  of  the  story here.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I have a question for Mike as well.In preparing for  this meeting, we had the research  staff at  New Yorkplay the game of what would be  the  result  of various  tightenings.  Inthe model  that we used, which is partially  in our heads,  we got  aboutthe  same  result  from a 50  basis point  tightening that you get  from the100  basis  point tightening,  and a fair bit  more, i.e.,  a much weakereconomy  from 100 basis  points.  Do  I assume  correctly that  the policypoint is  not  so much that policy will  have  to be  firmed by  100  basispoints, but  that policy will  definitely have  to be,  to pick an adverb,substantially firmed  in order to  avoid the  inflationary result  thatyou are convinced the  Committee would not wish to  see?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  You've  served up  such a softball here,  I hate  toreject  it  at  all, but  I am not  sure  whether in  the  greater  cyclicalscheme  of  things, I'd call  50  basis points  or even a 100 basis pointssubstantial.  Now, we're not  talking about  throwing  the economy  intorecession, but  looking back over time,  I think, we have  seen  that  ithas  frequently  taken very large movements  in  short-term rates  toachieve  a major change  in  the direction of  aggregate  demand.  Theother point  I'd make  is  that, yes,  the signal we hoped  to  convey was7/5-6/94-21-some  degree  of conviction.  I wouldn't say definitely we're  going toneed to  tighten, but we  have  some  conviction that  a significantmovement  in  that direction was probably going  to be needed to achievethe  kind of  outcome that we're  talking about.  I must  say  I am alittle  surprised and quite interested  in  the results  that  youdescribed from your staff's work because  the numbers  that  we have beenciting come  from a model  that  tends  to be  one  of  the  most  highlyinterest-sensitive  that we  can  find.  And so  to  get the  result  thatyou  characterize is  a bit  surprising to me.  There may be  a lot  ofother add  factors and  so  on  that  are  going on in  this  exercise.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Who would like  to  start  our Committeediscussion?  President  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our 1994  forecast is  soclose  to  that of  the  staff  that  it's  hardly worth mentioning thedifference here.  In  some respects, we  get  there  in a different way.Nonetheless,  the  1994  results are  the  same.  For  1995,  though, thereis  a greater  discrepancy.  Our outlook  is  somewhat stronger  for GDPand just a bit  lower  for  inflation.  Therefore, we have  not built  intoour  forecast  the policy tightening that we  have just been  talkingabout.  I think  fundamentally these  differences perhaps  reflect  ourview that potential  growth  is  a little higher  than the  Board staff's.With  regard to  the  District,  overall conditions  are largelyunchanged from  the past meeting  or two.  The Midwest economy  iscontinuing to  operate  at what  I think is  a comparatively  strong pace.The  auto business  continues  to  be good, and I think the  recentreductions  in  sales  in April  and May had more  to  do with capacityconstraints  than any significant  change  in  consumer  attitudes.  Theauto  industry sales  expectations  for  the  third quarter  arecomparatively strong, with domestic production schedules  set  at  some18  percent  over  last year.  Since retail  inventories  are  very low,  Ithink at  this point  the  downside risk  in this  production schedule  isvery  limited.  Of  course,  all  the  industries  that  are  serving the  autosector  such as  steel  continue  to  experience very strong operations.What's  true  for  the  auto  sector,  I think, is  true  for manufacturing ingeneral;  there  are  not many soft  spots  in  our District  in  that  sector.The  forecasts of  sales  for heavy  trucks have not  increased  since thelast meeting.  At  this point,  the manufacturers  are dealing withcapacity constraints,  and lead times  for delivery of  the  large, heavytrucks  have been stretched out.  The delivery times  for heavy trucksin  general have stretched out even more  out--to July 1995.  In  thehome  appliance business  in April  shipments  were at  record levels;  andsales  of  agricultural  equipment, another part of  our economy that'simportant, are  likewise at  high  levels.Despite the  strong  results  in  the manufacturing sector,  Ithink there  are  some  signs of moderation and slower growth in  otherparts  of  the  District  economy. who runs  thetrucking company reports  that  there hasbeen a downward shift  in  the  rate of  increase  in  shipments.  But  thisdownward shift  is  from the very, very high levels  the  truckingindustry has been experiencing.  He  says it  is  particularly apparentin  shipments  to  retailers  in general  and for paper products.  Also,the  retailers  I talked to  are  seeing signs  of  moderation.  In  lookingback over  the  last  few months,  there seems  to  have  been  some kind of  ashift.  People I talk to  are not  sure whether it  is because of  the7/5-6/94-22-higher  interest  rates or  the  result  of high income tax payments.Nonetheless,  I think there  clearly has been some moderation  in theretail  sector from the high  levels earlier  in  the year.On  the price  front,  I do  sense  some pressures,  though nothingdramatic.  But after a protracted period when manufacturers were  ableto  push  their suppliers  to  reduce prices,  they are,  as  one company putit,  approaching payback time,  and we  hear of  more price  increases.There are also some  upward pressures on  wages.  The  trucker that  Ijust mentioned has  reported an  extreme  shortage of  truck drivers.  Todeal  with that, percent  increase  in wages.  Another manufacturer I talked to  who has  amultiplicity of  contracts  they are  renewing says  the  terms  are  alittle  higher, at  least,  than  in  the past.  With tight  laborconditions, we  have to  worry that  at  some point  these  are going  to betranslate  into higher  labor  costs.  So  our outlook  for  inflation,while  still positive--indeed  it  is  a little  lower  than  the  staffforecast--suggests  that  there  are  some  worrisome signs  out  there  thatwe need  to  keep our  eye  on.has granted an  8Finally, in  the  ag sector,  growing conditions  for  the graincrops  continue to be  favorable.  Planted  acreage  in  the  District  thisyear is  3 percent higher  than  last year.  As  of  the  end of  June,  thecorn crop was  described as  excellent.  That  obviously  is  a verysignificant  improvement over what we were  experiencing  last year.There is,  of  course,  a long,  long time  from now to  harvest,  and we'reat  a critical point  in  the  growing  cycle.  But  with a reasonable breakin  the weather  the crop production  should be  pretty good.  And grainprices, which certainly have been  terribly weak over  the  last  severalweeks,  are likely  to be restrained and ought  not  to  be a significantcause of  inflation.

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  the  economy  in the  Twelfth Districtis  continuing the  trends noted  in  the  last  few meetings with weaknesspersisting in California and Hawaii  and strength elsewhere.  Thesituation  in California has  changed very little.  Employment growthhas been weak through May, rising at  an  average annual rate of  about0.4  percent  since  employment hit  its  trough in  December.  Mostforecasters expect  this very weak recovery to  continue,  with serviceemployment gains  slightly outpacing losses  in  the manufacturing areathrough the  remainder of  1994.Turning  to  the rest  of  the District,  conditions  range fromgood to very good.  Washington and Alaska have reported employmentgains  of  1.6  and 2.4  percent respectively over  the  last  year.Moreover, Boeing's  announced layoffs  are  nearing completion, whichwill  help the  Seattle  economy  since a major negative  for a long periodwill no  longer be present.  However, Alaska is  facing an  uncertainfuture largely because of  a long-term decline  in oil  production.  Therest  of  the  District is  very  strong.  Nevada, Utah, and Idaho are  thethree fastest growing states  in  the nation in  terms  of  employment.Arizona  and Oregon  also report  rapid employment growth.  Constructionremains  at a high level  in these  states,  although activity has  leveledoff  a bit in both Idaho  and Nevada.7/5-6/94-23-Turning to  the national  economy, my outlook differs  somewhatfrom  that  of  the Greenbook in  a couple  of respects.  First,  I wouldnot be  surprised to  see the  economy  slow somewhat more  in  the  latterhalf  of  this  year  than shown  in  the Greenbook  forecast  as  a result ofthe  tightening moves  that have been made  so  far.  I would then expecta little more  strength  than the  Greenbook implies  for  1995,  althoughthe  outcome  clearly depends on  future policy actions.  Second, I havebeen  impressed pleasantly by recent  inflation results and certainlyimpressed by recent data on  employee compensation costs.  Even  afterconsidering  the  lower  dollar and higher  oil  prices,  I think it'spossible that CPI  inflation will  come  in at  or  even a little below 3percent  for  the next year  and a half.  I do,  however, think  that mostif  not all  of  the  slack in  the  economy probably has  been used up andthat the  longer-term  inflation  outlook is  a significant  concern.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. BOEHNE.  The  Philadelphia District  economy is  growing ata moderate pace, although  still  less  than  the nation  as  a whole.  Theexpansion  is  generally broad-based, geographically and  across  sectors.Some  slowing,  however, is  occurring  in  the pace of  growth.  Consumerspending  is  still  leading the  way, particularly  in  areas  of  homefurnishings  and autos.  Retailers  remain  guardedly optimistic  aboutthe  outlook, but  a number have  trimmed  their projections  for  the  restof  the year.  Much the  same  can be  said  for manufacturing.  Orders  andshipments  are positive, but a number of  manufacturers  see  less  growthduring  the  second half.  Realtors  generally report that  home salesremain good, especially for low- and mid-priced homes.  Some builders,however, report slowing in  the  pace of  new construction.  Concernabout  rising mortgage rates  has  damped their enthusiasm somewhat.Commercial  real  estate markets  remain  soft;  the prospects  are  betterin suburban areas  for next year and beyond.  In  Philadelphia,  there  isstill  a markdown of  some  less  than  top-grade space.Sentiment  in the  District overall  is  positive, but  a littleless  so  than when we met  six weeks  ago.  Most business people  believethe  pace  of  growth will be positive, but slower  during the monthsahead.  It's  the  "but slower"  part that  makes  them a bit  uneasy.  Howmuch slower and the  impact  on  the bottom line  make  them just  a touchnervous.  Consumer sentiment  is  positive  as  the  job market  improves.With few exceptions,  however, wage pressures  are well  contained in  theDistrict.  High visibility layoffs  still  cast a cautioning note  onpeople's  feelings,  though,  about  the job market.Price pressures  appear to  be contained.  There  is  more  talkof rising  input  prices, but most people  still  feel  it's  quitedifficult  to  pass on  those  increases, although I am certain businesseswould if  they could.Turning to  the national economy,  there  is  clear  evidence  fromthe  consumer  sector, labor  markets, and the  industrial  sector thatpoints  toward a slowing from the  rapid pace  earlier  in  the year.  TheGreenbook forecasts  are  reasonable estimates  in my judgment  of  howthings will  turn out.  Nonetheless, we  should be naturally skepticalof  any forecast.  We  are  in a transition  from a higher growth rate  toa lower growth  rate.  And we  have  to monitor  incoming data  closely asa reality check on  the magnitude  of  this  adjustment.  We could easily7/5-6/94-24-underestimate  or  overestimate the  extent  and smoothness of  theadjustment  for a whole range  of  reasons.  Likewise, we  are  in anespecially sensitive period on  the  inflation  front.  We have  come toofar  in  the  disinflationary process  to  reverse  course at  this point.At the  same  time,  we  do need  a lengthy period of  sustainable  growth.These objectives  are  compatible, but  the margin of  error for  policy issufficiently narrow as  to  require a close  reality  check on  incominginformation  about  capacity constraints  and demand pressures.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman,  growth in  the Atlanta Districtcontinues  to  be quite positive,  although we are  seeing  somemoderation, and I think our growth rate  is  now moving closer to  thatin the nation  as  a whole.  The exception  to  this  is  the  State  ofGeorgia where  strong  in-migration and the beginning  of preparationsfor  the  Olympics are  having  a very noticeable  spurring effect  on  theexpansion.We are  seeing  some price pressures, but  they  are concentratedprimarily in  the  construction area, although manufacturers  are alsoexperiencing pressures  in  the cost  of  commodity inputs  and they expectthese  to  continue.  But  they  tell  us  at  the  same  time  that  they arenot  able  to pass  these price pressures  through to  the  final  consumer.We are  seeing  some wage pressures  also  in  the construction  area, andthat pressure comes  from the  shortage of  skilled workers  in  thatindustry.Retailers  in  the District were  disappointed by  theirperformance  in May, and they  experienced some  undesirable buildup  ininventories.  Activity apparently picked up  in June, but  they  areindicating downward revisions  to  expectations  of  sales  in  the  future.Trucking firms  are  also  reporting  that  shipments  to  retailers  haveslowed by more  than  they had expected.  Automobile  sales  are a littledifficult  to  interpret.  They have remained fairly  slow during  thesecond quarter, but  low inventories of  popular models  seem to  be citedas  the  reason  for  this  slowness.  But unlike  the  expectations  ofretailers  generally, car  and  truck dealers  expect  1994  to be betterthan  1993.  Tourism and business  travel  are  mixed around  the District.We don't yet  have  the  results  of  our manufacturing survey for  June.We did  see  a pickup  in production in  May, and the  share of  firmsexpecting  increases  over  the  next  six months  also rose.  In  the areaof  capital  spending,  I think  it's  interesting  to note  that  a number ofindustries  in  the District have  recently announced plans  to  expand orto upgrade  their facilities.  In  the energy area, the  rig count  inLouisiana  declined a bit  in May, but  it's  still well  above the  levelthat we  saw a year ago.  Spot  and futures prices  for natural gasremain  above the  level  needed to  encourage  additional  activity.In the  housing sector, rising mortgage rates  are having animpact  on  the  residential market.  Demand  for new homes  is  describedas  strong, but  here again the  pace  is  moderating and permits  havetapered off from  the very high levels  that  we had earlier  in the year.Multifamily building, as Mike reported  for  the nation  and it's alsoreported in  the  Greenbook, is  strong in many areas  of  the District  andthis  is  expected to  continue.  Commercial  real  estate markets  arebeginning to  improve;  slow and steady gains  are  expected in  the futurein  this  area  as well.  Financing  is not particularly easy  to obtain in7/5-6/94-25-this  area, but  it  is more  available  than  it has been  in  the  last  fewyears.  With respect  to  overall  loan demand, it's  about  flat  in  theDistrict.  Of  course,  as  in most parts of  the  country, residentialmortgage refinancings have pretty much dried up.The  general  sentiment,  I think, among people  in  the Districtis very positive in  the  context  of  the  good growth  that we  areexperiencing.  There  is  very little apprehension about  inflation,notwithstanding the  price pressures  in construction and the wagepressures.  But interestingly, I have had no  complaints  from businesspeople about  our policy actions  over the  last  four months.Looking at  the national economy, our  forecast  follows  apattern that's  similar  to  the  one  in  the Greenbook.  On balance,  Ithink we  see  somewhat  stronger  growth,  although we  have a smaller risein the  federal  funds  rate  than  is  assumed  in  the Greenbook.  Ouroutlook  for  inflation  is  a little  less  sanguine  than the Greenbook's.We see  some  deterioration  in  inflation toward the  end  of  the  forecasthorizon, but  it gets  a little better as  we  look further out  into  1996.The  principal uncertainty  that  I have is  the outlook  for consumerspending.  Are we going to  see  it  sustained?  It  seems  to me  that  theconsumer  is  building up a good deal  of debt,  and there  is  a questionof  how  long people  can continue  to  spend, given this  deterioration  intheir balance  sheets.  I think we have an  interesting period ahead ofus, Mr.  Chairman, and I see  the  risks  as  evenly balanced between theup  side  and  the down  side,  although I think  the  inflation outlook  isnot terribly good as  I look further out  over  the  forecast horizon.

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  Tenth Districtcontinues  to grow at  a very good pace.  Some  early signs  of pricepressures  have  emerged and we have reports  of  high prices  and shortsupplies  of  some construction materials and scattered reports of  laborshortages  in  the District.  Also, we  continue  to hear of  someincreases  in  land prices;  right now our land prices  seem to be risingyear-over-year at  about  twice the  CPI  rate  of  inflation.  At  least  todate,  we  do not  see  any upward pressure on  consumer prices  in  theregion.  Construction activity and especially residential  constructionare  vigorous.  Manufacturing continues  to  rebound and we  see growthshifting from nondurables  to  durables manufacturing with emphasis  onautos  and  airplanes.  Higher oil  prices  have boosted drilling activityonly a little  in  the  District.  District crops  are  generally in goodshape.  Of  course, we have  seen  a sharp  drop  in cattle prices,  andthat has  triggered some  significant  losses  to  some  of  our producers  inthe cattle  industry.Looking ahead, we  think the  District economy should  remainstrong  on the whole.  A rise  in  construction activity is  anticipated,although  residential  construction is  expected to  level  off during theremainder  of  the year.  We  also  think  a strong national economy shouldmaintain  a rebound in manufacturing.  The  outlook for  firmer  oilprices  still points  to only modest gains  for  the  energy  industry inthe  District.  As  one  of  our directors pointed out,  that  industry  isaffected by so many different  factors  that  they are very cautious  interms  of  going ahead with energy exploration.  Losses  in  the  cattleindustry,  we think, will drag down our  farm  incomes  this year despitethe  good outlook for  crops.7/5-6/94-26-On  the  national outlook, incorporating  the  latest  first-quarter revisions,  we  expect  that real  GDP will  be  just  slightly over3 percent  for  1994,  assuming an unchanged monetary policy.  Economicgrowth  is projected to  slow in  the  second half of  the  year as pastincreases  in  interest  rates begin to  affect, or  continue to  affect,interest-sensitive  spending.  Nevertheless,  we  think growth shouldremain slightly  above potential  in  the  second half,  and as  a resultwe  expect overall  CPI  inflation to rise  to  around 3 percent on  theyear for  1994  and to  continue at  that rate  in  1995.  Thank you.

MR. PRELL.  Mr. Chairman, may I just  follow-up  on something  Isaid to Governor  Lindsey earlier, which may not have  been theperfectly good  answer, as  President Hoenig's remark  about  oil pricesand production reminds me.  Obviously, with the higher  oil  price,  wecould get  some stimulus  to  domestic production that  could be positive.The other  side  is  that  to  the  extent  that we  are  importing all  of  thisoil,  we have  the  so-called  tax plus  the  shift  in  income,  even todomestic owners  of  oil,  from  consumers which  leaves  a damping  effect.How we come  out  on nominal GDP,  I think,  is  a very  tricky empiricalissue here.  But  our  simulations  would still  suggest  that,  if youwanted to  avoid  the blip  in  inflation, you would have  to  add restrainteven beyond what  you would get  just  automatically from this  oil  tax  asit  were, in  order  to have  enough  slack to  even out  all  of  that  impulseon  the price  side.

MR. LINDSEY.  The  inflation blip but not  the  nominal  GDPblip?

MR. PRELL.  On nominal  GDP,  it  could be  a wash and certainlywe  have  simulations  that  could produce  that  result.

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, New England continues  to  recover,with  employment about  1/3  the way back to pre-recession  levels.Nonfarm payroll  jobs  have  expanded over  a year  ago  in  all  six NewEngland states,  with the  regional  total  growing only  slightly belowthe  rate  for the  nation as  a whole.  May unemployment  rates in  all  sixstates were below year-earlier  levels,  disregarding  the measurementchange.  Jobless rates  in  four of  the  six  states were below thenational rate.  Among the six, Massachusetts  and New Hampshire werebetter, and Connecticut  is  bumping along the bottom  in  employmentgrowth  over  the year.  Business  sentiment  is  generally positive,according  to  several  local  indices  as  well  as  anecdotal  reports.  Theregion's  job growth  is  concentrated in  services.  Employment inmanufacturing has  leveled out  in recent months,  following  almost acomponents,  residential  construction materials,  industrial  machinery,and replacement parts report  strong sales.  The price picture  isreasonably favorable.  Manufacturers  continue to  say they are unableto raise prices except  in the  area  of  consumer nondurables.  Whilesome of  their own  costs of  materials are  rising, businesses have beenable  to reduce  other costs by pruning workforces  or  introducing otherefficiencies.With respect  to  the national  outlook, our  current view isgenerally consistent with the  Greenbook's  for 1994.  We were  glad tosee  the staff's  reassessment of  the NAIRU, since  it  brings  them much7/5-6/94-27-closer  to our own  assessment.  However, we continue to  be a littlemore  optimistic  about potential  GDP.  In  1995, we  see growth rates  alittle  stronger  with the  same  levels  of  inflation and slightly lowerlevels  of  unemployment.  All  of  this,  of  course,  depends on thedefinition of  the  appropriate monetary policy, and ours  is  slightlyless  restrictive  than  the Greenbook's.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  With  respect  to  our projections  for  1994,  wehave  somewhat  higher rates  of nominal  GDP growth  and inflation  thanthe central  tendency, but  for  1995 we have  significant  furtheracceleration  in  inflation--considerably more  than other members'forecasts  that  I have seen.  Basically, I would attribute  that  to  ourview of  the  lagged effects  of  an increasingly accommodative monetarypolicy, roughly in  the period 1991  to  1993.  That degree  ofaccommodation has  been manifested  in a number of ways.  One way  Iwould cite  is--I  have mentioned this  before--that base  money over  thatperiod was up  approximately  $100 billion, and  that  in  turn providedthe basis  for growth  in  the  stock of M1  by more  than  1/3  over  thatperiod of  time.  I thought  it  was  quite  interesting in  Joan's reportthat  she  indicated  that,  even  though we perceive that  we havetightened, we have purchased $16  billion of  securities  this  year,  soin  1994 we  are essentially on  the same  $100 billion per  3-year pace  ofadditions  to  base  money.With respect  to  national  economic  conditions,  conceptually Ithink what  has been  going on  is  that we  have  seen  the more  rapidgrowth in  nominal GDP reflected  in  strong  growth  in  output  andemployment rather  than rising prices and wages.  Even though  there hasbeen some  slowing  in output and employment,  in my view the  economy isstill growing  at  an unsustainably high rate.  In  that  regard I wouldcite  just  two  examples.  Industrial production, which has  slowed  down,has  still been growing  at a 3.9 percent  annual  rate  since  February,and payroll  employment has  been  growing at  about  a 3.4  percent annualrate over  the  same period.  I find that  information particularlytroubling  against  the backdrop of  capacity utilization at  a relativelyhigh  level  of  83-1/2  percent,  which is  up  3 percentage points  in thelast year.  The  civilian unemployment rate  is  down  1-1/2 percentagepoints  over  the  same period to  a relatively  low 6 percent.  I mightalso note  that the  level  of  unfilled orders  as  indicated in Part  II  ofthe Greenbook has  risen quite  substantially over  the  last  year.  So  myview would be  that  our focus  should be on  the prospect of  risinginflation at  this  juncture, not  on growth  which is  slowing fromunsustainably high  levels.With respect  to  the  District, economic activity in  the EighthDistrict also has  expanded rapidly  in recent months.  We have had manyfirms report  expansions,  additions  to payroll,  and increases  to  sales.Major auto producers  in  the District plan to  boost productionsignificantly in the  third quarter, in  line with announcements  fornational production increases.  Loan demand  continues  to  grow rapidly,and favorable  crop  conditions  are reported.  We hear more  frequentreports  of  difficulties  in finding labor.  Two of  the examples that  Ihave heard in the  District would be  skilled  construction workers,which Bob Forrestal  also mentioned, and truck drivers, which has beenmentioned by someone else.  There are  also reports  of  growing delaysin deliveries  of materials.  District civilian employment  growth has7/5-6/94-28-outpaced that  of  the nation  in recent months.  As a result,  ourmeasure of  the District's  unemployment  rate, which we base  on a proxyof  four principal  states  in our region,  has  fallen  to  4.8 percent  inthe  lowest  level  registered  in  almost  20  years.  The  District's realestate  sector remains  very strong, with robust  home  sales.  Theinventory of  houses  for sale  is  unusually low in  many areas,  and thisis  adding  to price pressures.Finally, let  me make a couple  of  comments  about  inflation.  Iwas  certainly more comfortable  last year when the broad measures ofprices were showing annual  rates  of  increase of  1 to  2 percent.  Buteven  then, as  I think  I expressed at  the  time,  I was worried about thestance  of policy and its  likely implications  for  future  inflation.  Inthe meantime, most  inflation measures,  as  we  all  know, haveaccelerated, including broad inflation measures.  Just to  cite  anexample, since  September  the CPI has  risen at  a 2.7 percent  annualrate,  up  from  the  1.8  percent  registered  from April to  September  1993,and  similar patterns  obtain  for other broad measures of  prices.  Inaddition,  some  narrower price measures  are moving up  even moresharply.  For  example, in  the  latest  four months, both  the  PCEdeflator and the  capital equipment  component  of producer prices wereup at  about  3.8  percent  annual rates.  This  information, takentogether with recent  data on  sensitive industrial  materials prices  andoil  prices, makes  me very uneasy about  the  possible path of  futureinflation.  I think the  risks  are very clearly in  that  direction.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I want to  add my own two cents  worth to  theLindsey question about  the  spike  in oil  prices  and to what  extent  itshould  lead to  an  increase in  the  fed  funds  rate.  To me  that  pointsout  the need  for a good  reliable monetary aggregate.  Then we  couldsay we would not change  it;  we would  stick with it  and let  the marketanswer that  question.On  the national economy, our expectations  are very consistentwith the  staff's  forecast both  for  1994  and for  1995.In  the Dallas District, we have  seen some  slowing  in  the paceof  economic growth  over  the past  two  months  compared to  the  two monthsbefore  that.  Much of  the  slowing was  concentrated in  the  interest-sensitive  sectors  such as  construction and  construction-relatedmanufacturing.  Interestingly, many of the  same  sectors were  sufferingfrom capacity constraints,  so monetary policy does  seem to be  exertingsome  impact where that  impact  is most needed.  Sentiment  has  shiftedslightly from accelerating economic  activity to  continued moderategrowth.  In our  recent  surveys,  fewer firms  than previously arereporting a pickup  in price and wage pressures  and an increasingnumber  of  firms  are reporting  that  they do not  expect prices  toincrease in  the  short  run.  Competition  remains pretty  fierce,particularly at  the retail  level.  Capacity constraints  are  limitingoutput  gains in  brick, cement, glass,  and structural  steel  in  spite  ofefforts  to boost  capacity over  the past  year.  Semiconductor  andcomputer equipment manufacturers  are building large,  new factories  inTexas, but  they still have  growing backlogs.  A truck manufactureroutside  Dallas  reported that he was  operating  at  full  capacity andexpecting to  continue doing so  for  at  least another  year given his7/5-6/94-29-orders  flow.  These  industries  experiencing  capacity  limitationsrepresent  about 23  percent  of  our District's  manufacturing output butonly about  4 percent of  total  output.On the  trade with Mexico  and NAFTA, the  situation  is  a  littleconfusing.  If  you visit  our border  cities,  you get  the impressionthat  the  favorable  impact  NAFTA previously had  on retail  sales  inthose  cities  is  somewhat weaker.  But what  they can  see  involvingtrade  between the  two  countries is  much more positive.  The anecdotalevidence  suggests  that  the backup  in  truck  traffic  is  longer goingsouth than  it  is  going north, but  that  doesn't  accord with thefigures, which  I believe  show that  imports  have  gone up  20  percent  inthe  first quarter  compared  to  a year ago,  while  exports have  gone  uponly about  13  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, for  some  time  I have beentalking  about  strength in  our District.  Perhaps  I am too  sensitive  toreports  I hear  of  economic  strength,  but  the  recent  reports  we havegotten  from our  business  contacts and  the surveys  we  conduct  suggestto  me  that,  overall,  the  District economy  is  still  strong.  A  coupleof  examples:  shipments  of  manufactured goods  and  new orders  atfactories  are  still  rising;  tourism, especially at  the  Carolinacoastal  resorts--places  like Myrtle  Beach--is  exceptionally robust;  wehave reports  of  record bookings at  a lot  of  these places.  Withrespect  to  commercial  construction, both retail  and office  vacancyrates  have been declining, and as  a result  we  are  seeing  for  the  firsttime  in  some  time  some  speculative  commercial  construction.  We alsohave  seen some  scattered reports  of  labor  shortages  in parts  of  theDistrict--not a whole  lot,  but  a few.  We do  see  some  signs  ofmoderation  in  our  District, as  has  been reported  for  other Districts.Car  sales  seem  to  be  slower and residential  construction activity mayhave moderated a little  recently.  In explaining  that  slowing,  ourcontacts  cite demand  factors  and to  some  extent higher  interest ratesand  higher income  taxes.  But  they also  cite  supply factors  as  hasbeen the  case  in some  other  reports--low car dealer  inventories andshortages of  skilled housing subcontractors,  something mentioned by acouple of  people.  Men  are working  seven  days  a week  in places  likeRaleigh-Durham, and  they are getting a  $1,000 bonus  if  they move  tonew  jobs.With respect  to  the national  economy, our projections  arevery close  to  the  Greenbook for both 1994  and 1995.  Like  the  staff's,they are predicated  on the assumption  that  this  Committee will  takeadditional  near-term policy actions  necessary to  contain  inflation.Even with that  assumption,  our view  is  that  the risks  in  theprojection  are on  the up  side--pretty clearly  so  from our standpointfor the  remainder of  1994.  My view would be,  and  I  think my staff'sview would be,  that  policy was pretty accommodative and  stimulative atleast  through the  first quarter of  this  year.  We  think that  will  tendto bolster  aggregate demand, at  least  through  the  end of  1994.  Itwould not  surprise me at  all  if we got  a nominal GDP  growth  rate  forthe  second half  of  the year  that  is  a good deal higher  than  the  5percent  annual rate projected in  the Greenbook.In any case,  what  is  key in my mind is  not  so much  theexactness  of  our  projections quarter-by-quarter  for  the next  several7/5-6/94-30-quarters but rather  the  accuracy of our  assumption that we will  takenecessary  action  to keep  the inflation  rate  from trending upward  in1995  and  thereafter.  The  unemployment rate has  already  fallen to  thebottom of  the range  of  current  estimates  of  the natural  rate,  which isa situation  that  concerns me.  I have a lot  of  sympathy with TomMelzer's  comments  on  this.  I am  certainly concerned about thepossibility that  inflation pressures will now begin to intensify.  Weare  hearing more comments, more  concern about price pressures,especially supply prices  in our  District.  And as  far  as  I amconcerned,  these pressure showed up pretty dramatically  in  the  latestpurchasing managers'  report.  That  report showed the percentage  ofrespondents reporting higher prices  as  48  percent, which was  aboutdouble what  it  was  three  months  ago.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Wasn't  it  higher because of  the  oilprice  increase?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  That  could be.  In  any case,  it  was  asignificant jump,  and I think that's  something we need to  keep  inmind.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The District economyremains  in very good shape,  and most  of  the  indicators suggest  thatthat may continue for  some  time, perhaps  for an extended period  oftime.  Employment gains have remained sizable;  job availability  isgood.  There  are  some  shortages  of  labor--in construction  tradesclearly--as  has been mentioned.  Despite this  healthy economy havingbeen in place  for  quite  some  time,  there really are no widespreadsigns  of  building wage and price pressures.  Interestingly enough,  theone place  one  can find wage pressures without  looking too  hard  is  inthe entry-level  jobs.  Firms  have  said they have had to  raise  startingwages  in  order to  attract  and retain people;  otherwise,  they move  onpretty quickly as  soon as  there is  an opening  at  the next wage  levelacross  the  street.  Much of  the  agricultural  sector  of  the  District  isin good  shape,  although  the livestock  and dairy industries  are havinga very difficult  year because prices  have declined.  We recently had ameeting of  our Advisory Council  on  Small  Business, Agriculture,  andLabor.  The members were generally upbeat along  the  lines  I have beendescribing,  although they did suggest  that  there was a note of  cautionin  the  air  as  a consequence  of  the  increase  in interest  rates.  But  itdidn't  seem  to have  translated  into any changes  in plans  or  intentionsor  in what  they were  seeing in  their businesses as yet.With regard to  the national  economy, my own view is  that wemight  get  a little more real  growth  and a little  more inflation  thanis  depicted in  the Greenbook, but  I don't  view those differences  assignificant.  If  I take  a step back, my sense  of  things  is--and maybeI am a little  too  sanguine or  am overly  influenced by what has  beenhappening  in  the District  for a long  time--that  we  are  on a path thatwe may well  stay on  for  some period of  time,  that  is,  moderate growthand moderate  inflation.  I personally have been  surprised, given theperformance  of  the  economy over  the  last  couple  of years  and given thediminution  of unemployed workers  and of  unused capacity inmanufacturing and elsewhere, that we  have not  seen more  wage and pricepressures.  I have  asked myself  about  that development  or  lack of  thatdevelopment  as  it  were, and I have  tentatively  concluded that perhaps7/5-6/94-31-the  economy is  a little  less  inflation prone than  I thought  earlier.In any event,  my sense  is  that we may remain  on the path we  are on  forsome time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  the  economy in  theNew York District continued to  advance  at  a moderate pace  in  latespring.  Unemployment  rates  fell  and payroll  employment rose.  Statetax  collections  for retail  sales,  personal  income, and corporatefranchises have  risen moderately so  far  this  year,  suggesting growthin the underlying  streams  of personal  income,  corporate  income, andretail  sales.  Vacancy rates  for  commercial  office  space continue  toconstruction of new, single-family homes have  snapped back from  theweather-reduced lows  of  the  first  quarter.  For New York City,however,  several  recent  economic  indicators,  including  establishmentemployment,  city government payrolls,  and initial  claims forunemployment  insurance  suggest  that an  economic pause  may bedeveloping.  The  financial  sector, needless  to  say,  is  not  havingquite  the happy experience  that  it  had in  the  first  half  of  1993.  Onan  overall  basis,  the  District  economy maintains  a reasonable pace,although we  still  compare  rather poorly with most  areas  of  thecountry.Our  forecast  on  the national  level  is  that,  even given anunchanged monetary policy, real  GDP growth will  gradually taper  offfrom the  roughly 3-1/4  percent  rate  in  the first  half  of  this year  toaround 3 percent  in  the  second half  and about 2-1/2  percent  in  1995.We think that  slowing growth  is  likely the lagged result  of  the  run-upin long-term  interest  rates.  The  forecast  is  a bit  softer on growththan the  one we prepared for  the  last meeting  and it  reflects  the  50basis point  increase  in  the  funds  rate at  that time  and a slightlyhigher path of  long-term  interest  rates  than we had anticipated.  Wethink  this  increase  in  long-term  interest rates  will particularlyaffect  housing  and related elements  of  consumer  spending, such  asfurniture and appliances.  Indeed, available  evidence suggests  thatsingle-family housing starts  may have begun  to  slow, although howconvincing those data  are remains  to be  seen.  We  think that higherrates  should also  affect  motor vehicle sales  and perhaps slow downcapital  spending.  That  forecast  would put us  rather  along the  linesthat Gary Stern suggests.  Our problem is  that we  think the risks  toour  forecast are  asymmetric.  There  is  not much risk of  the economybeing  less  strong, but  there  is  a major risk  that we  areunderestimating the  upward momentum in both real  output and inflation.The  housing market  could recover  later this  year when householdsadjust  to  higher  interest rates, while  export demand could pick upstrongly with a decline  in  the  dollar and overseas recoveries.Therefore, we  think  it  is very  important at  the present  time  to  watchvery carefully the  real  economic data  coming  through to see whetherthe  rather benign path  that is  possible  is  in fact  taking place orwhether  the  stronger  growth, which we  think  is  the  likely alternative,would indicate  that  rather  strong policy moves will  be required.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I can comment  on  a number of  things  in theDistrict  that might  add  to what  has been said so  far.  Generally,7/5-6/94-32-people  feel  that  the  District economy is  stronger than  before  andbetter  than some people were projecting  earlier.  I have no convictionat  all as  to  whether this  is  even  a coincident  indicator,  let  alone  aleading indicator.  A regular recently completed quarterly survey ofalmost  500 businesses  in  the  District indicated  that  42  percent of  thecompanies expect  to  hire  full-time permanent workers  this year versus33  percent when that  survey was  previously taken;  43  percent now saidthey are  going to  increase capital outlays;  37  percent  said thatearlier.Energy used by the  industrial  sector is  said  to  be booming byone  of  our  companies,  up very sharply  in  the  first  half.  Somesegments  like cement  are  up 35  percent, while nonresidentialconstruction  is  flat.  Overall,  residential  activity is  up in  theDistrict,  and we continue to hear anecdotal  comments about  shortagesof skilled workers  and certain  kinds of  supplies.  My contacts  tell  methat  lumber prices appeared to  have  stabilized, but  copper  is  sovolatile  that builders  can't get  firm bids  on electrical work  forfuture projects.  Various  aspects of  communications  are quite strong.Firms  in  the  Pittsburgh, Cincinnati,  and Lexington  areas  claim to  beoperating  at  capacity levels  and  increasing  employment.  One directorreferred to  explosive  growth  in  the  high-tech area.  Throughout  theDistrict,  though, medical  care  is  down, and  that's  a big  segment  ofthe  Pittsburgh area economy;  it's  large but  relatively not  as  large inCincinnati,  Columbus,  and  Cleveland.  Our  contacts  in medical  care  allsay that  they are shrinking  their payrolls.  That was  really  the  onlysector  that was  cited as  being weak.  Interestingly, contacts  ineastern and central Kentucky say  that  conditions  are  the  best  in  overa decade,  and they're  talking  about planning to  do  away with coaldependency and produce  other things,  especially wood products  giventhe problems  in  the Northwest, and  interestingly poultry.  WesternOhio  and  Indiana have  done so  well  on poultry that  Kentucky peoplehave decided to  enter  into  the  glut  of  chickens,  eggs,  and turkeys.We visited a Toyota plant  outside Lexington, in  theGeorgetown area.  They are  going  to add a new model  to  theirproduction line.  They employ 5,200  workers now and are  going to  addanother  800 by year-end.  They say  their biggest problem  is  that  theworkers  have  to  commute  1-1/2  to  2 hours  to  the plant because  theresimply is  no  housing and no  schooling  in and around  the  Lexington areaclose  to where  they work.  Also  in  the  Lexington  area, people say  thatapparel  is  booming, that  it's  easy to raise prices, and that  severalthousand workers  have been recalled.There were a lot  of  reports  of price  increases  in  theDistrict.  I don't have any sense  that  they have anything to  do withinflation, but  still people  talk about prices  going up.  The coatingbusiness  people  said that  their backlog  is  at  an all-time high andgetting even  longer.  They have  seven-day, 24-hour operations  for thefirst  time  ever,  and they put  through chemical price increases  onintermediate products of  up to  9 percent on July 1.  The strike  atAllegheny Ludlum  that  I reported on  before has  ended.  They settled ona package  of  four years with a total  increase  increase in  compensationof  11  percent plus profit  sharing.  The manager said he  is  running hisoperations  quickly back almost to  capacity.  Demand for  his products,both domestic  and foreign, is  very strong.  He said exports  ofspecialty  steel  to China,  India, and Poland are  growing very rapidly.He was  looking  for price increases  of  anywhere from 5 to  9 percent  for7/5-6/94-33-the  balance of  this year.  He complains  about  the  rules  that  give  thegovernment  veto power over his  business.  Plastics  also are  reportedto be  the strongest  in  six  to  seven years, with record ordersespecially  for equipment  for plastic manufacturing.  That  appliesmostly  to plastics  used for medical  supplies  and appliances.  Theyalso  are  talking about  their ability  to raise prices  later  on.  I gotcontrasting  reports  from auto parts  suppliers.  One supplier,representing a huge company  that  operates worldwide, was  berating mebecause  he  said that  I didn't  understand that  it  was global  capacitythat was preventing  increases  in  the  prices  of  their  products.Another almost as  large company said it  was  very easy  to  raise pricessharply because of  the  level  of  the  dollar  and the  related  fact  thatdomestic  auto  companies  and transplants were  regaining domestic marketshare.  He was  talking about his need to pass  through higher  inputprices--chemicals, metals,  etc.  He  thought  he  could do  it;  othercontacts  thought he  couldn't.On  the national  outlook and the Greenbook, I had a lot  ofproblems with the  inflation projection--I guess  this  spills  over intothe Bluebook discussion  for  tomorrow--that  the  3 or 3.1  percentinflation rate  in  the  staff  forecast  continues  into the nextmillennium because  it  seems  to me  that  the  basic model  is  consistentwith  a constant  rate of  inflation.  That sort  of  analysis  says  thatwhatever the  rate  of  inflation is  at  the time  the  economy hits  theNAIRU, that  is  then the  inflation  rate we  live  with  forever unless weare  willing  to cause  unemployment by raising  interest rates.  To methe projected inflation numbers  that  we are  looking at--whether  or notthey reflect  reliable model  results--should be  unacceptable  to  thisCommittee  if  we are  going  to  maintain the wording in  the  directivethat  our  objective  is  to move toward price  stability.  When Isubmitted my projections  for  1994  and 1995,  I took  literally theinstruction  that  they  should be based on what  would be  an  appropriatemonetary policy.  It  seems  to me  that  an  appropriate monetary policyobjective  should be  one  that  leads  to  a lower rate  of  inflation.  Andso  that's what I submitted.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr.  Chairman, this  economy  sounds  as  good as  itgets.  But before  we  all  start  feeling  too good, I thought  I wouldreport  on  something that  I have not mentioned  for a little  over  ayear--it won't make us  feel  good--and that's health  care.  There  arefour Congressional  committees considering the  health care bill,  and  Ithought  I would share  with you some  of  the  economics  that  are  implicitin  that  legislation.  It  looks  like  the  direction  in which it  ismoving has  some  kind of  subsidy for moderate  income  families.  If  wethink about  it,  that's  a very natural  path that we  should applaud.The  catch  is  that  when the  subsidy  is  phased down as  family  incomerises,  it  is  no different  than  imposing  a tax,  at  least in  terms  ofthe  side  effects.  The numbers  involved are impressive.  The  CBO hasscored the Clinton plan for  a family as worth $7,000.  So,  say wephase down the  $7,000  subsidy over a range of  $20,000  or  somethinglike  that;  that  is  a 35  percent marginal tax rate.  The  chances arethat  something  that  generous will not pass.  So,  I scaled back  theClinton plan by about  30  percent  to  a 1994 cost  of  $4,800.  For afamily, these numbers  are very much  in  line with what Senator  Cooperhas proposed and what  Senator  Moynihan got through his  Committee.  Fora family  of  three,  the health care bill  would add 27  percent  to  the7/5-6/94-34-percent  social  security and FICA  taxes,  state  and local  income  taxes,plus  the phaseout of  the  earned income  tax credit,  a single mothersupporting  two kids would be  in  a 75.7  percent marginal  tax ratebracket  for  income from about  $14,000  to  about  $34,000.  I know ourstaff's  model doesn't  take marginal  tax rates  into  account directly,even  75  percent  ones,  but  that would seem to  have  some  seriouseffects,  especially to me.  For  larger  families,  the phasedown rangeis  wider and the  effects  are more modest.  Assuming the  earned incometax credit  is  already phased out,  families of  four  earning between$20,000  and  $50,000  would have marginal  tax  rates  of  around 49percent.  So we  are now in  the  situation of  having  the  great  bulk ofmoderate-income America  facing marginal  tax rates  of between 50  and 75percent.  And  that's with a moderate health care bill!  We  speculatedearlier  about possible supply shocks  that might come  from the MiddleEast  but  the actual  shock might  come  from Capitol  Hill.  Things  are  assweet  as  they get, but we  always manage  to  shoot  ourselves  in the  footsomehow.  Thank you.

MR. LAWARE.  It may be  a habit, but  as  has been usual  inrecent months,  I am going to  play the role  of  Cassandra and I wouldencourage you to worry with me  about  the  economic environment.  I amconvinced that  the moderation in housing, autos,  and retail  sales  isnot  as  much a function  of higher  interest rates  as  it  is  a function ofanxieties  endemic  in  the public.  This would seem  to be borne out byrecent marginal changes  in consumer  attitudes.  When members ofCongress  cannot  make up  their minds  about health  care  and how it  willbe paid for and by whom, the public becomes  confused and uncertain.Add to  that  the  continued  reengineering of  corporate America and it  iseasy to  understand why people worry about the  security of  theiremployment.  That all  adds  up to a reluctance  on  the  part of  bothconsumers  and the  corporate  sector to  take  on  long-term commitments.Certainly, the pattern  of business  investment  spending in  recentmonths  is  for  replacement, not expansion, of  capacity.  While many ofthe market measures  of  capacity utilization and unemployment  levelsare  at  the threshold of  exerting upward pressure  on  inflation, itseems  to me that  the tea  leaves are  still very hard to  read.  Thismight be  an appropriate  time  to  take a breather until  it  is  clear  whatthe  direction and magnitude  of  economic  activity turn  out  to be.You're welcome.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I have been comfortable with allof the  policy moves we  have made  this year.  The primary reason isthat  it  certainly has  seemed to  me  that we needed to  remove  thestimulus from policy that  was there  for a long  time and was no  longerappropriate.  But  I have had questions  throughout the  spring as  towhat  the  real economy might require  after we  eliminated that stimulus.The  questions were primarily in  two related areas.  It's  clear that  weare approaching  full utilization of  resources  in  the economy, but  ithas  been unclear  to me  just how close we really  are.  More importantthan that,  as  we move  into  that  zone, what  sort  of momentum will  theeconomy have that might push  us  into an  overheating-type situation?Related to  that,  over the  time horizons  that  the FOMC  can usually andreliably work with, how likely are we  to set  off  some  type  of7/5-6/94-35-inflationary  episode?  In  support of  that  line  of  questioning, I havebeen  reciting a litany of  factors and I am not going to  repeat those,but  it  does  seem to  me  that  the  recent  information, on balance, hasbeen  stronger  than  I would have expected.  The  first quarter of  1994has  proven to be  stronger  than  it  first  looked to  us  and the  secondquarter  looks stronger  than I expected earlier.  We have  talked aboutthe decline  in  the  dollar and  the  foreign economies  beginning tostrengthen.  The hours  numbers  recently have  been remarkably strong,and employment  looks  as  if  it might be as  well.  I am not  prepared tosay  that all my questions have  gone  away, but  it  does  seem  to me  thatso  far  events  seem to  be more  on  the side of  strength in  the  economy.Momentum is  certainly greater  so  far  than  I would have  anticipated.We have been getting reports  today from around  the Districts  that  someslowing  is  beginning to  become  evident;  we will  see how much of  thattakes hold and how quickly.  But  from where we apparently have  beenrecently and appear  to be  today,  if  that momentum is  clearly  still  ineffect  very much  longer,  I am going to have  to move in  the directionof  thinking that we may need  to  do  considerably more in  the  area  ofpolicy changes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  While  the  expansionappears  to  be continuing,  the  question is  at  what  pace, and we  allseem  to be  struggling with  this  question as  to  whether we  are  below,at,  or  above  capacity.  On  the  supply side,  how much slack  is  left  inthe  labor  and product  markets?  Even  if we  had good historicalmeasurements  of  aggregate  capacity and slack,  I wonder  to  what  extentwe could use  these  to  estimate  the  future.  In  the area of  laborstaff  estimate  for  the  current  quarter  is  6.3  percent unemploymentwhen  the  current rate  is  at  6 percent, and Mike  Prell  suggested  thatwe were uncomfortably close  to  being analytically blind at  this point.I thought  he gave  a pretty good description of  some  of  the  concernswith the  labor market  information.  A number of  folks  are re-estimating the NAIRU, and  the  announced values  that  they're  coming upwith vary all  over  the  lot.  I think we  are  experiencing significantlydifferent  labor  conditions  in different parts  of  the country.  Atleast  for me,  that's  one of  the  explanations as  to why there  is  somuch uncertainty.  This  raises questions  about  labor mobility betweenregions or perhaps  labor mobility just with respect  to  certainprofessions.  We are  hearing certainly of  spot  labor  shortages, and  acouple  areas  were mentioned.  I do  think that  this  re-engineering  thatwe have  talked about  over the  last  several months may be  changing  theequation and causing  a bit more churning.  And just because  somebodyhas  a job,  they may well  be  looking  for  a better job.  So  I think thatthat  is  fogging  the  numbers somewhat.On  the price  side, the most  consistent story, it  seems  to  me,is  that while  there  are pressures  in  the basic commodities,competition  is  constraining  final goods  prices.  But even  this  storystrained.  For me,  it's very hard to  ignore  the sustained priceincreases  in 1994  for many of  the  basic commodities.  Certainly, thereare ways  to deal with price  increases  in  commodities that  continue  fora short period of  time.  If  these  increases  are  sustained  for  a longerperiod of  time,  that's going  to be more  of  a problem.  On the  demandside, we  have heard and are  seeing evidence  of  some  slowing in7/5-6/94-36-spending, but  the  question  again  is  whether we  will  overshoot,achieve,  or  undershoot  that  elusive  soft  landing.I haven't heard quite as  much discussion of  the  financialdiscussion.  I think that  the markets have  survived significantturmoil  beginning with  the  Fed tightening  in February.  After thattightening, markets  have been hit with international  uncertainties,foreign exchange  crises,  and  domestic political  crises.  But  overall,the  market performance,  I think,  has been quite  good.  We have had  nomajor U.S.  casualties;  money has moved;  we  do not have gridlock.  Theinto place in  the  last  couple  of years  seem to  have worked.  Bankinternal  risk management models  appear  to have worked.  Thecontraction of  exposure has been  fairly orderly  as  we have  gonethrough  significant market  moves.  Bank credit  has  expanded.  I  thinkwe have weathered that  road quite well.  I didn't want a  fair  amountof  this  turmoil  to  go  unnoticed just  because we are  not  seeingheadlines  about  problems  in  financial  markets  and  institutions.  Theinflows  to  mutual  funds,  but at  least we  are not  seeing massiveoutflows  from  some  of  these markets.  The  stock market  is  certainlydown for  the year  but  it  has  moved sideways  for  the  last  three  months.We may  still have  some volatility concerns  about  the  bond market,although  this  is  less  likely  to  cause political  concerns  because  thebond markets  affect  individuals  less  directly.In sum,  this  is what  Ed Boehne  called  a transition  period andwhenever  we are  at  a change  in a business  cycle, we  are  likely  to  geta fair  amount  of  conflicting data and mixed views.  And since  we  seemto have more  than  the usual  amount  of  conflicting data and opinions,  Iam going  to assume  that  we have  found  the  turning point.  At best, wehave  the  soft  landing  and maybe this  is  as  good as  it  gets  as  LarryLindsey mentioned.  The  key  at  this  point is  not  to make  a mistake andend up  with too much inflation  or  in  a recession.  I do  think  that  thetough part  is  going  to be  to  hold on  to  the  gains  that  we have madeagainst  inflation and,  in  fact,  to  make  some  progress  toward achievingprice  stability.  Unfortunately, I think  that  the  going will  gettougher, with more  tightening  from  this  point  on.  We may well  begoing  onto slick pavement  as  we  travel  forward.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  As  all  of you know,  Iwasn't here when  this  tightening  started, and  I was trying  to  imagine,if  I had been here  on February 4th,  what  I would have  wished for  July.I think  I would have wished for  almost  exactly what  we have gotten interms  of  the  real  and nominal  economy.  I wouldn't have wished  thedollar  down, obviously,  and  I think  I would have  expected  andcertainly wished  that  the  run-up  in  long rates was  less  than  it  hasbeen.  But  in  terms  of  the  evolution  of  real  spending and  the  signs  ofinflation,  I think what we have today  is  very, very close  to what  Iwould have wished for back  in  February--which  is  to  say better  thananyone  reasonably should have hoped  for,  because wishes  don't usuallycome  true.  I judge  the risks  now to be pretty balanced under  currentpolicy, as  Bob Forrestal  said;  and  I would add  something  to  that:  "andthey are  small."  It's  very hard  for me  to put much probability on  ascenario that has  a very large  overshoot  capacity.  And it's  very hard7/5-6/94-37-for me  to put much weight on  a scenario of  the  economy's  growth rate--never mind a recession--going down to  growth of  1 percent  or  1-1/2percent in  1995;  that  seems  quite unlikely.  So  the risks  arebalanced, I think,  and small.  It  looks  to me  like  a three bearseconomy:  not  too hot, not  too cold,  it's just  about right.  It  seemsthat  the Committee was  very, very lucky--[laughter]--skillfully lucky!Let  me  say for  the  record that you  can do  the  right  thing and beunlucky and come out  in  terrible shape.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You can do  the  right  thing and turn  outright.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  And you can  do the right  thing  and turn outright,  which is  the way it  looks  for  now.  The  staff's  forecast  looksabout  correct  to me,  given  the  further tightening  of monetary policythat's assumed in  that  forecast.  I call  attention  to  something  that Ifelt very much and that Mike  Prell  pointed to  himself,  that the  3-1/2percent  growth rate  for  the  quarter just  ended was  predicated on  somegood numbers  coming in  that  we haven't  seen yet.  Mike characterizedit  as  a stretch,  and it  looks  like a stretch to me;  we might get  it,but  it  does  look  like  a stretch.  The staff's  2.2  percent  real  growthforecast  for  1995  is weaker  than  the Committee  consensus;  but I think,given  the  additional  100  basis point  fed funds  rate  increase presumedin that  forecast,  it's  not unreasonable.  I would point  out that,given the  lags  in monetary policy, we  should expect  that  tightening  tocarry over  into  1996,  and that  would say to me--the  forecast  horizonends  at  the  fourth quarter  of  1995--that we may see  a slower growthrate than 2.2  percent, perhaps  a slower  growth rate  than 2 percent,  in1996  under the assumed policy of  another  100  basis point  increase  inshort  rates  with some  sympathetic movement  in  long  rates, not with azero  change  in  long  rates.  I want  to  talk some more  about  this whenwe  talk about policy tomorrow.  To me,  2 percent  growth starting  inlate  1995  and into  1996  looks a bit on  the  low  side,  if  you believethat we are  fairly balanced right now, and  I'll  come  back to  that.I wanted  to raise  one more  question.  Susan and a number  ofothers  talked a lot  about  capacity.  Mike  Prell was  quite right,  Ithink,  to  say the  light's  a little bit  out  on  the  extent  of pressureson  capacity right  now.  As  I listened to the  reports  from  the  twelveDistricts, which echo more  or less  the  Beigebook, I thought  there  werefewer  reports  of  tight  labor markets  than one  would expect  if  we aresitting exactly at  the natural  rate right now.  I think the  anecdotesare consistent with  the view that we have, not  a lot,  but  a little bitfurther to  go and,  of  course, we  can never know  that  for  sure.  In  thesame vein, on capacity utilization:  I think we want  to  remember  thatafter an  investment boom of  the length  and magnitude  that we have hadand are still  having,  it  is  very likely that  there  is  more industrialcapacity out  there  than we  are actually picking up  in  themeasurements.  This  just  reinforces my view that  the  risks  are  two-sided.  There  is  a risk of  coming up  short  as  well as  the risk ofgoing beyond.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I call  on  Mr. Kohn.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  [Statement--See Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Don,  let  me sort  of  interpolate  on whatyou ended up  saying with respect  to providing 1996 projections  toCongress.  I think our public policy posture  always has  to  be  in  favorof  either  low or  declining unemployment  rates  or  low or declininginflation.  The  truth of  the matter  is  that while monetary policymatters,  it  obviously can't  encompass  as much as  the committees  up onthe  Hill  would like  to require  us  to  accomplish.  I think we have  toindicate  that we will  accommodate  as  strong a growth as  comes  out  of  anoninflationary environment.  Indeed, we would foster  such growth butargue strenuously that  long-term stability and the  sustainability ofemployment  require that  inflation be held in  check.  While weacknowledge the short-term Phillips  curve,  we can't  acknowledge,because  I think it  doesn't  exist,  anything beyond the  very short-termposture.  Once we  get  into  that,  I think we  are  letting ourselves  beled down a road of  public policy perceptions  that we can't meet andshouldn't meet.  If  Congress  wants  to  impose  certain requirements  onus,  that's  their prerogative, but  for  us  to  get  out  there  and make aprojection, which we  all  do,  we also have  to  recognize  thatprojections are not  goals.  I will  make  a projection that  I think  theinflation rate will  be  "x" and I think  "x" is  unacceptable.  Thatdoesn't mean that  I say  "x" is  unacceptable,  therefore I will  changeit.  A goal  and a projection are  two  fundamentally different  things.We don't make the  distinction in  our request  for your projections.  Wemerely ask what  individual members  are projecting.  Some are  thinkingof  them as  goals  and some  are making them as  forecasts.  And that'sfine;  it's  fine  in  the sense  that  it  seems  to be working.  But  once weget  out  beyond  the  intermediate period,  I think we're in  for  someserious  questions.I might  just  say on  the  monetary growth  ranges that  I aminclined to  do nothing on M2.  The  reason  is  that  I think the  1 to  5percent  range is  where we want to  be when eventually we  get velocityin M2  coming back, and I wouldn't want  to  touch it.  But  I amintrigued by the notion  of  taking the  debt  aggregate down as  a symbol.The question is how relevant  it  is  to  the outlook.  Indeed, I have asuspicion  that  it may be more relevant  than  the M2  numbers.  What typeof  perception do you  think that  would create,  if  any, in  the

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  There might be a reaction that  the Fed is paying alittle more  attention to debt,  that  is,  you bothered to  change  therange instead of  leaving it.  But  I think  it would depend crucially onthe  rhetoric that was  associated with the change.  If  it was explainedthat  slower  debt growth has been occurring  over recent years andshould continue to be  associated with slower nominal GDP and dampedinflation,  I don't  see us creating a new  feeding  frenzy around debt,if  that's what you  are concerned about.  I think it  is  perfectlyexplainable.  It  is  a very high range,  especially compared  to  the M2and M3  numbers.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.7/5-6/94-39-

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Don,  I was  surprisedby Chart  1, particularly  in  light of  what  the  Chairman  just  said aboutour eclectic views  of  the  Phillips  curve, which  is  that  one probablyexists  in  the  short  run but  not  in  the  long run.  That  Chart  1,  if  Ibelieved it--and I believe everything you  tell me,  Don--would convertme  into being a wild dove  because what  we  could do with  easier moneyis  to  reduce  the  rate  of  unemployment permanently below what  it wouldotherwise be without  ever  paying any  cost  for  that.  Now  look at  thebottom of  the  chart.  It  means,  as  I understand  it,  that  simply byprinting money we  can  increase  the  long-run aggregate  amount  of  outputin  the  economy.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think  the models  embody a vertical  long-runPhillips  curve;  it  takes  a while  for it  to  come  out  here.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Into  the next millennium!

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes.  If  you had not noticed  that  the  inflationrate  is  up at  4 percent  and  the only  reason  it's  not continuing on  theupward trajectory is  that we  bent  the unemployment rate up  and so youhave--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But never backwards?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  No.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Only the  coefficient  is  unchanged eventhough  it  gets  smaller.  What Governor Lindsey's  saying  isarithmetically irrefutable.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  In this  time period, that's  right.  But  if  youstretched out--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Then  the  interesting  question--I  amsorry.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  No,  go  ahead, please  finish.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  strikes  me  that  if  we're postulatingthat  there  is  no evidence  of  long-term Phillips  curve  tradeoffs, butthat  there  is  one  in  the  short  run, it  therefore  follows  thatsomewhere between  the  short run and  the  longer run, it  is  backwardsloping.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  If  the unemployment rate had not  come back uptoward  the natural  rate,  inflation would have  continued to  accelerateon  a straight upward  line.  If  you believe  that  there  are some  coststo  inflation,  those  are not embodied here;  that  is,  the uncertaintiesand costs  of  higher  inflation  rates are not  in here.  I think it  isvery  strongly the Committee's  view that  they are not indifferent  tocreating  a 4 percent  inflation rate  versus  a 3 percent  inflation rate.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  What  does  this  cost?  I assume  the civilianunemployment  rate  is  not a bad proxy for  real  GDP, so  we never pay areal output  cost.  The only time  the unemployment  rate  even starts  togo up under  this  chart  is  when we eventually raise  the  fed  funds  rate.7/5-6/94-40-

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  But  if you didn't  do  that,  the  inflation  ratewould continue to  accelerate  forever.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  if  I were going to  vote just  on  this  chartor  if Mr. Gonzalez  or any member of  Congress asked me  to  vote on  thischart  for  a term  that exceeds  a senator's  term, we now can vote  tohave  an interval,  which  is  really what  we want  to  look  at  on  the CPI,that would--let us  see  it  looks  like,  I am just going  to  ballpark itand say  3/4 percent  for  6 years.  So  4 million extra  job years  can bebought by this  Committee by voting  for  the  easier money path atvirtually no  inflation cost.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  You  have a percentage point of  inflation  cost.There  is,  as  you say,  an  interval  if  you go  from 3 percent  inflationforever to  4 percent inflation--without  taking  account  of  thefeedbacks on economic  growth but  just  in  Phillips  curve terms--inwhich you will  realize  some  extra output  in  the meantime because youcan drive  the unemployment rate below the  natural  rate  for a shorttime before bringing it  back up  to  the  natural  rate.  But you will  endup with 4 percent  inflation, not  3 percent inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  And when will we  ever pay the price?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  When you tried  to bring  inflation back  from 4percent  if  there were a cost  associated with 4 percent rather  than 3percent  in  terms  of  the  efficiency with which the economy operates.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  there's  no  cost  in  terms  of  output?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Unless  there  is  a feedback from the  4 percent  to 3percent  on productivity and on  efficiency.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I just want  to  make  a comment, but  first  atechnical  question.  Do  these  results  come out  of  the MPS econometricmodel?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The baseline  is  judgmental;  the deviations  fromthe baseline  come  out of  the MPS model.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That  thing will  cycle  as you let  it run;  sothat's  one part  of  the answer.  I am a  little  surprised that  itactually hasn't  crossed zero  by 1999,  but it's  going to cross  zero  andactually get,  I think,  to  fairly exciting numbers  on  the other  sidebefore  it  cycles back down again.  But  the main point is  that  thisreally shouldn't be  a surprise.  Larry, you just  described whathappened in  1988-89.  We had an  interval  of  extra jobs  as  we overshotthe natural rate;  the  inflation  rate rose by almost  exactly 1percentage point.  Then this  Committee reacted to  that, and we had arecession, and that's where you pay the cost.  You're  looking  at apicture of  1988-89  here, basically.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  If you  extended that  to  2006  or 2008 orsomething like  that,  you do believe  I think that  we would actually bestarting--7/5-6/94-41-

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think this  would probably cross  in  the year2000,  if  you just  let  the MPS  model run.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes, but  the  fact  that  the  base case  isa judgmental  model  tells  you  something about  the  add factors  that wehave  to deal  with in  this broad MPS model.  If  we allow the MPS modelto  run with no  add-factor changes,  the  results  we'd get--I  willstipulate without  knowing it  and Mike  can  take a  shot at  me  if  hewants  to--would be garbage.  It  would be unacceptable.  If  the un-add-factored model  engenders  results  that  do  not  seem to  capture what  isgoing  on  in  the real  world, why do we  assume  that  a simulation comingfrom that  model,  which is  supposed to  capture  what's  going on in thereal  world, captures  the actual  scenario?  I think we have  thisproblem  that  is  always  involved in  any of  these  simulations.  I thinkDon  is merely doing what we  want  in putting something together  to  getus  focused.  But what may be wrong with all  this  is  that  instead ofputting  down a literal  timeframe,  I think we  should put down  T, T+1,T+2,  because  I am not sure  we  know what  the timeframe  of  this  wholeprocess  is,  and I am sure we don't  know what  the reduced form of  thiswhole  system is  because  it  doesn't  fit  the real  world in  a way thatmakes  any of us  comfortable at  this  stage.  If  it  did, we wouldn't beusing  so much judgmental  evaluation in working  off  the  MPS model  toget  a  set  of  relationships, which  I think is  the  right  way toforecast.  That model  forces  you to  make  certain  key  judgments  forconsistency.  But  it  doesn't  force you  when certain elements  withinthe  system are very difficult  to measure  and are  really highlyimportant  to  the end result.  We can argue  this  as  much  as  we want,but  the  truth of  the matter  is  that  we would have  to  fall  back on ourown judgments  of  the  impact  of  this  sort  of  thing because we  arepressing  the  limits  of  our  technical  capabilities to  get anything morethan  illustrative  types  of  scenarios,  which is  what Don has  beentrying  to  do.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I was going to  suggest not  only removing  the  datesfrom the  horizontal  line but  also  removing  the  scale  from  the verticalline.  [Laughter]  I agree with what you  said, Mr.  Chairman;  it  issupposed to  illustrate tendencies.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I have  no quarrel  with anything you said, Mr.Chairman.  Indeed, it's  a point  that  I have made many times,  and  Ihave  convinced myself  that  I should be very leery  about presentingthese  kinds  of  simulations.  If  I don't  buy the model  in  the  baselineforecast,  why should I buy the  differentials  literally?  Now  they areprobably the best we  can do  systematically at  this point because  it'svery hard to  juggle all  of  these variables  in a  judgmental  fashion andcome  up with a whole array of  alternative  simulations.  And we  aretrying to  improve  the model  so we  can have  greater confidence.  Ithink  the key question  the Committee has  to  ask  is whether  it  believesthe  baseline.  For example,  those who  feel  that  the NAIRU  is muchlower  or  that  the  true unemployment rate  is  lower relative  to  theNAIRU would have  a different  baseline path  so  that  the  moststimulative policy wouldn't necessarily yield higher  inflation  than weforecast.  It  might be comparable  to what  we  forecast.  Still,  thepoint,  I  think, is  that you only get  a  short-run benefit,  and not along-run benefit,  if you feel  that  over time  higher inflation has  anegative  implication for  economic  efficiency and productivity in theeconomy.  That,  I think, is  the key judgment  you folks  have to make.7/5-6/94-42-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I just want  to make  one response  toGovernor  Blinder.  It  is  true  that  when  the inflation rate went  to  4percent, we  responded.  But  if  we believed  the MPS model with  itslinearities  and the  very long-term  implications  for  tradeoffs, webasically would have said, well,  4 percent  is  acceptable.  That'sbecause  I found, looking  at  the MPS  model  in 1989  that  simulating 4percent or  the  type of  inflation rates  that existed using nominal  addfactors,  the  case  that  could be made  for  the  type  of  policy weinitiated to  tighten up was  very weak.  The model  that  we wereeffectively using as  a policy instrument  did not  coincide with  this.I think one  of  the  things we are  learning  is  that we  are  forced  to  fitlinear models  to  structures  that don't  stay stable long  enough  to  geta fix.  I think  intuitively, if  I want  to  use that word, we try toadjust  to that.  I am sure because  we were here, at  least  I was  in1988-1989.  It's  not as  though we have  an  irrational  sense  that  4percent  inflation  is  sinful  or that  it  is  inappropriate  for  societyfor  a whole  series  of  non-economic points of  view.  The reason wemoved as we  did was because we thought  inflation was  truly underminingthe  fundamental growth and  stability  of  the economic  system.  Youcould not have  inferred that  then,  I would wager, by runningprojections  off  the MPS model.  In  fact,  I remember them.  I looked  atsome  of  the  ones  in which we  tolerated  just mildly higher  inflation,and  I had the  same  impression as  Larry did.  You know, why not,  if  youbelieve  it.  The question is  do we?  I don't want  to  speak  for theCommittee, but  listening  to  the way this  thing evolved over  the years,I would say  that  there's very great  skepticism with respect  to  thistype  of  linearity.  My own guess  is  that  the MPS model  isn't  simple.It's  complex, very sophisticated--the best  econometric model  I haveever  seen.  But  the world is  far more  complex than  that,  and I thinkwe have  a tough  task in  trying to  figure our how to  play against  thatworld, which  always does  things  we insist  it  shouldn't  be  doing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I just want  to  comment  on what we have  beendiscussing.  I think one  of  the problems with an  exercise using thisapproach is  that  there  are no  explicit  costs  associated withinflation.  That was  implicit  in Governor Lindsey's  comments.  But  ifwe  continue  to  look at  it  this way, we  are  always  going  to  say,  atleast  at  first  glance, why not avoid a tighter policy or why notindeed go  to  an easier policy.  One of  the  things  we have  to  try tofind  is  a way of  considering explicitly the costs  of  inflation  in  allthis.  My impression  is  that  there are  some models  around that  dothat.  But  until we do  that,  it  seems  to me  that  these  exercises arereally  of very limited value, because it  always looks  as  if  the  bestthing to do  is  either nothing or ease.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That basically is  built  into  anyKeynesian  structure  that  does not have  a feedback mechanism  thatoverwhelms the  Phillips curve  and turns  it  around.  None of  the modelsof which I am aware,  including  the one  in which you draw a verticalPhillips  curve in  the long  run, which is  correct  for  the  long run,answers  the  question whether or not  the path going there  is  quitedifferent.  I don't  think we  have adequate  data to  capture that.That's  why we  have trouble with  this  sort  of  stuff.  We  have  to askourselves whether we  should forget monetary policy and focus on  thebudget deficit.  I would venture  to  say, because  I had some tests  runon  this,  that  if  you just allow the budget  deficit  to  expand by 207/5-6/94-43-percent a year  indefinitely, it's  remarkable how long it  takes  forsomething wrong to happen.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mike, along  the  same  lines,  as  I remember, acouple  of  years  ago you were  experimenting with a model  that had aforward-looking expectations  formulation mechanism  in  it.  As Irecall,  you  actually ran  some simulations  on  that model  at one  pointand  included those  in  the  Bluebook or at  least  a description  in  theBluebook that  give  very different pictures with respect  to  alternativepolicy postures.  Have you dropped  that  or are you still  doing  that?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They weren't  used in  the  Bluebook;  they werebased on  the  experimental  model.  This was  done  in the  InternationalFinance Division.  We  did  it  for  the  special presentation that wasmade for  the  FOMC on  costs  of  inflation.  But  I think thecharacteristics  of  those models were  not different  fundamentally--atleast what  I took away  from those models--from what  the Chairman justdescribed in  terms  of  these models.  It's  a question of  what  you putin.  You do  not get a better tradeoff  unless you impose on  the  model,which we  did at  that time,  that you have  a credibility  gain.  Rationalexpectations models don't  give you that  unless you build in  that view.But  that's  ex cathedra--not  something that you  can derive  fromstatistical  estimations.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Mr. Chairman, I think  it's  important  to mentionthat  if people  anticipated this  higher rate  of  inflation, we might  notget  this  short-run output  gain.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  To  be  explicit, under the tighter alternativeon Chart  1, I think something  like  that model would show  that  the  cost--in  terms  of  unemployment--of moving toward price stability in  thistimeframe would be lower.  I am not suggesting  that you substitutethat  kind of  model  for  this  model.  I am only  suggesting  that  it  washelpful  for me  to  have  that  as  another benchmark to  establish a rangeof possible outcomes.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  As Mike  explained, there are  two projects underway this  year in which the  staff  is  trying  to produce a richer set  ofmodels  for  you to  draw on, which will probably confuse mattersfurther.  But our  objective  is  to  try to  improve  these models and tobe  able  to  capture,  if  I can put  it  that  way, a richer mix of  theexpectations process  in  the presentations we put  forward to  you.  Youthe  forest  from it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Ted,  it  strikes me  that what  you arebasically saying  is  that we  are missing a few variables  in  the system,such as  a statistic  for  inflation expectations as  a key operativevariable.  If you want  to  look at  the  feedback effect,  one  wouldpresume that  the actual  mechanism through which it  would workbasically would be  through  something that is  measurable, which wecan't very well  observe at  the moment.  If  you  look back  through the'60s and the  '70s and the  '80s,  the  crucial missing variable  in themodels was  a number for  inflation expectations.  If  one  could haveforecast  that with any degree  of  accuracy, a lot  of what evolved overthe period would have  been readily captured in  the models.7/5-6/94-44-

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  At  least  that  expectations might be  shaped bysomething other  than  the  experience of  the past  several years--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  I am not  saying what  that  is  afunction of.  We know it's  a very difficult  issue,  but  that  is  the keyvariable.  It's  important, but  just  because we  can't make  a judgmentas  to what  these  driving  forces  are  in an econometric  sense doesn'tmean that  it's not  real.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I just wanted to make  an  additional point  inthis  discussion about whether  one believes  the model  or not.  If youbelieve  that you  can go  from 3 percent  to  4 percent  inflation  andpermanently buy some  increases  in output  and jobs,  when you get  to  4percent you will  also  find the  model will  show that  you can go  from 4to  5 percent and  also buy some  more  output.  The  same applies  from 5to  6 percent.  So you tend to  get  on  that kind of  slope, and it's  mucheasier  to draw the  line  at  lower  rates  of  inflation than  it  is  atintermediate  or higher rates.  I think we have  20  years  of  experiencewhich indicate the validity of  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I'd like  to  take  President  Boehne's  point  andjust reduce  it  to  a single  question.  If  we ran the model  out,  do webelieve that  if we  applied some  social  rate  of  discount,  the  losses  inoutput  later on would be more  than,  less  than, or  equal  to  the  gainsin  output  in  the  short  run?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The model  itself doesn't  have,  I don't believe,losses  in  output  from higher inflation  rates.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Ever?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I don't believe  so.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  it  might,  though,  in  tax  terms.  The  factis  that  our  tax system isn't  fully  indexed;  the  effective  corporatetax  rate rises  as  inflation goes  up,  and that  would raise the cost  ofcapital,  reduce  investment, and lower productivity over  the very longrun.  That,  I think,  is  probably embodied in  our  current model.  Andit's  one of  the  things  one would point  to  in  estimating  the lossesover  the  long run with higher  inflation.  There  are otherpossibilities in  terms  of  inefficiencies  in the price  mechanism'soperation and so  on that  are  not  captured.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But if  I heard you right, we never have  a netloss  in output resulting  from a choice  to  go  for  inflation?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It  does not take,  in  terms  of  a normal  simplecost  of  capital  calculation, a very big  inflation differential  to getyou a net  loss  in the  present value  in  the  long run.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  argument as  to why we get  a net  lossis  "the Federal  Reserve will  react--do something."  But  the questionis,  we  are  the Federal  Reserve  and why should we  react if  that's  true?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  If we  don't believe  that  the present  value ofoutput  in  this  economy will be  lower by letting inflation alone, then7/5-6/94-45-we  should let  inflation go up.  It's  as  simple  as  that.  Is  thereanyone  around  the  table who thinks  that  by printing money, the  presentvalue  of  output of  this  economy will  go up?  If  there  is,  I will  jointhem in voting to  cut  the  discount rate  to  zero.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Oh, no,  you don't mean  that  statement  asyou said  it!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Why not?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Because  the Federal  Reserve Act directs  us  tomaintain  stable prices.  We  are created  to  do  that.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  If we  can prove--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What you  said was:  If  anyone  aroundhere believes  that,  I will vote  to  lower  the  discount rate.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Yes.  I was surprised  that  Alan bought  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If anyone  convinces you--

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That's  true.  Do we believe  that  printing moneywill  increase  the present value  of  output?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes,  I think we would.  I believe  that printingmoney will  give the  economy a temporary high  that  will not  last  andtherefore  in  the  integral  sense  that  you  said, yes, you get  a largerintegral  of  output  over an historical  period,  if  you never decided  toend  it--if  you never  said, when you got  to  10  percent  inflation,whoops,  that wasn't very good, and you  went back to  lower inflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  but why would you  conclude  that  atthat point when, because as  Ed  Boehne  says,  11  percent  is  stillbetter?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  If  11  percent is  better  than  10  percent,  ifthere's  no  cost  to  inflation--I  am a little bit  surprised  at  the  tenorof  this  conversation around here!  [Laughter]  There  is  some  academiccontent  that  is--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In  all  seriousness,  the  question  reallygets  to  the models.  Why would you believe  that  there  is  a cost  ofincreased inflation  from the models?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Isn't there  a lot  of  cross-country and cross-timeevidence  that  once you get past  very low rates of  inflation,  there arecosts  in terms  of  growth  and efficiency  at  higher levels  of  inflation?Higher  levels  of  inflation  tend  to be more variable;  you get  a lotmore uncertainty;  people have  to  interact with the  tax system andother  things  that  aren't  indexed to  inflation  rates.  So,  there  aresubstantial  costs.  Now  if  the  System had confidence--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am guilty  of this  whole operation andthe  clock  is  running,  and  I request your  forgiveness for  opening  thisissue up.  But  sometimes we have  to  have a little  fun,  I guess.  BobParry, do you have  a question?7/5-6/94-46-

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes,  I have  a somewhat  different question.  Iwant to  ask about  an  earlier comment  that  you made that  you had apreference  for not changing  the  ranges  except  for perhaps  the debtrange in  1995.  I think we're all  well aware of  the problems in  termsof  the  significance of  the  growth in  the  aggregates.  But  as  I readthe  Bluebook, I certainly associated alternative  I with the baselineforecast,  which I feel  is  an  unacceptable outcome  as  one  goes  out  tothe next millennium.  Would you talk very briefly about whether youthink, if  we were  to  leave  the  targets  alone,  that  we would beconstraining  ourselves  to  follow the baseline?  Or would you say  thatthose  targets are  sufficiently broad and the uncertaintiessufficiently  great  that we  could still  be  confident  that we  couldfollow a path where  inflation would get  no  higher  and would begin  tocome down?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think with respect  to M2  and M3  thatthe  deviations from different  versions  of  P* are  such  that  we havecorrectly abandoned  those aggregates, but hopefully  they will  comeback and be  useful.  If  they come back and are useful,  we would assumeM2  would go back to  a zero  trend in  velocity, which  essentially wouldsuggest  that  the  1 to  5 percent  that we have  in  here is  where we wantto  be ultimately.  It  took us  a long time  to bring  the ranges  down  towhat  we perceived to  be  a noninflationary base  if  there  is  stable M2velocity.  My view, and I suspect  yours  and others,  has beenessentially to  leave  that  alone and just  wait  for  M2  to  come back  inthe  range rather  than  to  try  to  adjust  the  range  continuously to  thesevariations.  We can  just sit  and wait  for M2  to  come  back to us,  asdistinct  from trying to  chase it.The question  that  I am raising, however,  is  that  I am notsure  that  the debt  aggregate  is  all  that  irrelevant at  this  stage.I've  raised the  issue before.  I can't prove  it  and  I don't know if  wecan prove  it  after the  fact.  But I would say that  there have beenmany, many episodes  in American history where,  if  we  had had the datathen, they would have  shown an unemployment  rate under  the NAIRU andcapacity slack very rigidly constrained  and yet we  had very modestprice changes.  The reason basically, of  course,  is  that we  had astructure  in which credit  expansion was  restrained--institutions didnot  allow it--and we had the  convention of  a balanced budget.  Underthose conditions, one  can argue  that  it  was  the  lack of  credit  thatcreated the  stability of  prices.  There  is  the alternative  inflationexpectations view in terms  of  the  gold standard theoretically, whichmight be  the  ultimate  explanation.  But what  I am  saying is  that  it'sworthy of  at  least  thinking about  one  important  element here.  Thatis,  how much credit  is  actually made available out  there because  thecredit  aggregates may be working.  That hypothesis  raises all  sorts ofproblems  including how derivatives  affect all  of  this.  But  I amunsure  of  the  credit  aggregates question.  I don't  feel  strongly aboutbringing  its  range down, but if  we were  to  do  something, that's what  Ithink we could do.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Just  a follow-up question:  It  seems  to me  thatin your  testimony you could make  the point  that you just made about M2and M3,  saying that,  if velocity returns  to normal,  those  ranges wouldbe consistent with our  long-term objectives with regard to  inflation.You  could  then make  a similar argument with regard  to  debt,  indicatingthat  the  change  in the  range was being made  to make  it  consistent withour long-term objectives  for  inflation.  I would certainly find that7/5-6/94-47-preferable  to  saying  the  range  is  being changed  for technical  reasonsbecause we  expect  debt  growth  to  come  in  lower.  I think  there is  acritical  difference  in  the  two  interpretations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree with that.  Tom Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  thank you.  I have  two  comments.First,  on  the  debt  aggregate,  I tend  to  agree with your  suggestion  forbringing  that range  down.  As  Bob Parry was  saying, a  lower  debt rangewould make  it  more consistent with  the monetary  figures.  If  thatcould be done,  as  Don  described, without  raising other  issues  orhaving  other  things  read into  it--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do we want  to  leave the  so-calledsleeping dog  alone?

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  That  is  the other  option, yes.  The  second thingI want  to  comment on,  though,  is  your reference  to  the  1996projections.  I very much agree with you  there.  It  is,  I  think,unwise  for us  to  be  presenting  specific projections  into  1996  becausethey are  often  looked  at as  goals  and also  lead to  the presumptionthat we know more  than what we  are  really able  to  predict  into  1996.If  we do  it,  we would be well  served in  the  long run  to  do  so  as  Donsuggested, by your making general  statements  about  the  1996  outlookand not  committing us  to  specific numbers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I have just  two  comments.  Thefirst  is  on whether we should  change the  debt range.  I have  a verystrong  feeling that  that  is  a good thing  to  do but  that  the  likelihoodis  that  it would take  on  a  life  far greater than  it  has  any reason  tohave.  You will recall,  Mr. Chairman, that  when you presented yourHumphrey-Hawkins  testimony,  it  included  the concept  of  the real  fedfunds  rate as  one of  a variety of  things  we  look  at.  The pressreacted to  it  as  if  it  were  the new  "North Star"  for our  policy, whichyou never  intended it  to  be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  a good point.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I think a  change  in  the debt rangewould almost  certainly  have  the  same  fate.  Secondly,  just  briefly onmy pet  theory on  the problems  of  inflation, we  tend  to  think--and weshould because  our job is  economic policy and the  economic results--interms  of  the  economic  effects of  inflation.  But  inflation also hassocio-political  effects.  There  is  a traditional  economic view that  anincrease  in  inflation  transfers wealth  from lenders  to  borrowers;  Ithink  that  is probably valid.  But  there  is  a whole  segment  of  oursociety, most  of whom live  in inner  cities,  who  don't  borrow  for allpractical purposes.  I think  any increase  in  inflation makes their  lotworse, and  since their  lot  is  already very  seriously bad, it  riskssufficient  social imbalance  that  society would have  to  react with avery heavy allocation  of  resources  to  solve  that problem.  That canlead to  very serious  economic difficulties,  which we  ought to  thinkabout when we decide how we  feel  about  the overall  effects  ofinflation.  That  is  very, very hard to  put  into an economic  model.But  I think  that  if  some day we come  back  to  a general  discussion of7/5-6/94-48-how we really feel  about  inflation, we  ought to  try  to  crank thatreality, if  others agree  that  it  is  one,  into  our considerations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I must  say that  the  objection you madewith respect to  the debt  range  goes  to  the point,  and I think you areprobably right.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I was  going to ask whether  this  is  the  time  totalk about  the  1995  and 1996  projections,  or will  you have  a separatego-around about  that  later?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let  us just  hold up  on that.Unfortunately, our discussion has  gone astray, but  let  us  see  if wecan  get questions  out  of  the  way, then hopefully go back  formally tothe  agenda.  President  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree with your  comments withregard  to M2  and M3.  The point  on  the  debt  aggregate  that  Bill  raisedmade  the comment  that  I was  going  to make, but  I really wonder whatthe  correlation has been over  a period of  time between the  debtaggregate  and output,  prices,  and the  like.  Has  there been areasonable correlation?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It was  very, very good until  we  started to  targetit!  [Laughter]  The nominal  GDP/debt  ratio  fluctuated around a fairlyconstant  level  until  the  early  '80s,  and  then  there was  the  explosionof  debt in  the  '80s.  In the  last  few years, debt  has  come back muchmore  into line with nominal  GDP,  and our projection, as  Mike  showed ina chart yesterday,  is  that  it  will  remain in  line.  There  is noguarantee, obviously;  it's hard  to  see  the natural  force  that  isnecessarily keeping debt  in  line.  But  it  did fluctuate  closely withnominal GDP  for many, many years, before  the  leveraging phenomenon ofthe  '80s.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Hearing  that,  it  seems  to  me  that  Bill's commentis particularly appropriate.  By focusing any attention on this, weare  creating  something  that  could be  very awkward  in  the  long run.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am becoming convinced.  GovernorBlinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Let  me address  the  two  questions  that youraised, Mr.  Chairman.  On moving the  range  for  the debt aggregate,  Idon't  feel  very strongly about  that.  I feel  mildly receptive towardthe  "let sleeping dogs  lie"  philosophy.  But  it's  not something  I feelstrongly about;  one  can make a case  the  other way.I want  to  raise  the  possibility of  being a bit moreforthcoming  about  the  1996 projections than  seems  to be  the consensus,at  least based on what we have  heard around the  table  so  far.  One  ofthe  things  the  Federal Reserve  gets  accused of  by  those who arelooking  to  accuse  it  of  things  is  being  overly mysterious  andsecretive.  Some things  have  to be  secret, of  course.  But  the kindsof numbers we were  just  speaking about  for  1996 projections are verymuch in  line with the  consensus;  they would put us  right where theAdministration is,  right where  the CBO  is,  right  where  the  centraltendency of  private-sector forecasters  is.  I very much agree  that  weshould qualify it,  fudge  it,  make sure  that  these  are  viewed as7/5-6/94-49-projections, not goals.  I couldn't  agree with  that  more.  But  withbroadening them into  ranges, with the  kind of  prose that  goes aroundit,  I think our  interests might be well  served by saying  a little moreabout where we  think the  economy is  going in  the  slightly longer  run.The  second reason is,  as  we know and as  we always  stress,  thatmonetary policy needs  to  be  focused on a longer  horizon than  sixquarters.  I think any  one  of  us  around  the  table would  say wecouldn't make monetary policy  if we  closed our eyes  to what was  goingto happen  in quarters  7,  8, 9, and  10.  All  of  us  have some  ideasabout what's  going  to  happen in  those  quarters, which are quiteimportant  to what  we want  to  do  about monetary policy  today--probablya lot more  important  than what we  think  is  going to  happen  in  the nexttwo  quarters  in  fact.  So, both  in terms  of  clarifying  our ownthoughts  for  the broader public  that  is watching us  closely and interms  of  meeting a little bit--this  is  a very small  step--the requestfor more openness,  I think there is  at  least  something to  be  said  forgoing public,  so  to  speak, with these projections.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  ask you this.  These  numbers,  ifwe  could make  sure they are  conceived  of as  forecasts,  are  benign, butreleasing them would set  a precedent, which would then have  to  becontinued in  the  future.  There  are  going to  be  occasions  when I wouldsuspect  the  judgment  of  this  Committee  as  economic  forecasters, asprofessionals, would be  to  forecast a rising unemployment  rate or  someother  unwelcome development, and I wonder  how we  would handle  that  atthat point.  You can argue that  it's  a forecast,  but then  the responsewill be that  the  Federal Reserve  should prevent  it  from happening.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And we may not have  the  capability ofdoing so.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think that's  a perfectly  good question.  Ithink it's  likely--it wouldn't necessarily always happen--that  in  theevent  that we were  forecasting a rise  in unemployment  over  the  comingtwo years,  we would probably be easing monetary policy;  possibly wewouldn't.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But maybe not.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes, maybe not.  I don't disagree with that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I'd just  like  to  comment  on a couple of  theseissues  that  we have  been discussing.  First  of  all with respect  to  theranges,  I agree with you  entirely that  we ought  to  leave M2  and M3alone--I  assume you included M3 with M2.  I don't  think, given theuncertainty surrounding  those aggregates,  that  there's  any purpose  tobe  served by lowering  the  ranges  at  this point.  I don't  think thereis  a perception among  the public  or even people in Congress any longerthat  the  ranges really reflect  our  expectations  of what  policy isgoing to be.  With respect  to  debt,  I don't  feel  very strongly aboutthis,  but  if  there  is  a reason  to  change  the debt range,  I don't  knowwhy we wouldn't do  it.  I am not persuaded by the  argument that wewill  focus  too much attention on  it.  After all,  if  we have ranges,presumably we have the  flexibility to  change them from  time to  time.7/5-6/94-50-If  there  is  good reason to  do  so,  then  I don't  see why we  shouldn'tand let  the markets make  their own determination as  to whether we  aregiving  the debt  aggregate undue attention.  It's  quite  different withrespect  to  the monetary aggregates because  I don't  think there  is  anygood reason to  change  them.  If  we  think  it  is  desirable  to  change  thedebt  range,  then  I think we probably should go  ahead and do  it.With respect to  Senator  Riegle's request,  I must  say  that  Iwant  to  identify with the  comments  that  have  just  been made byGovernor Blinder.  It does  seem  to me  that  there  is  a lot  to  be  gainedby being a little more  forthcoming with  our  information.  It  clearlyruns  some  risks;  there's no question about  that.  But  I think webasically have the  same  risks with  forecasting 1995.  We  could be  in aposition,  for example,  in any given year of  forecasting  anunemployment  rate  that is  going up.  The Congress  could focus  on that,and  that  could give us  some problems.  Clearly, going out  to  1996presents more uncertainty, but  I think  the benefits  of  doing  it  areprobably greater  than  the risks.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Incidentally,  President  Jordan,  I hopedwe would get  back on the  track,  but  I am afraid we  are  in the  policydiscussion;  you're  on.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  In principle,  I would be  in  favor  of  publishinginformation  on the  inflation  objectives  out  to  1998.  But if  aforecast  of higher  inflation  is what  we  are  going  to produce, again,  Iam  in  favor  of not  even publishing  1995.  I think it  is  a mistake  forthis  Committee  to  put out  numbers  saying that  we  expect  the  inflationrate  to  go up  in the  context of what  we  think is  an appropriatemonetary policy--one that  will  result  in higher inflation  in  1995  thanin  1994.  The central  tendency of  our  forecasts also  has  1995unemployment above where  it  is  currently.  So, we have both risinginflation and rising unemployment  in  1995,  let  alone  1996.  I don'tthink we  ought to  be putting out  those kinds  of numbers.  I am pleasedthat  our  1994  forecasts are  below where the  Committee  collectivelythought they were going  to be  in  February on both  inflation andunemployment.  But from here on, we  see  things getting worse  in bothrespects.  I don't  see why we would want  to  announce that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I am assuming now that you want our viewson what we  would do with the ranges  and these  other issues;  I am  inthat  mode.  I would reaffirm the  existing ranges  for  1994  and  I wouldset  the  same  ranges  for  1995.  I would be willing  to  adjust  the  debtaggregate.  I think we  could deal  with any uncertainties  that  thatmight raise,  but  I don't  feel  strongly about  it.  My basic rationalewould be  the  same  one you expressed--the long-run benchmark conceptwith respect  to M2  growth and normal  velocity and the  consistency ofthat range with long-term price stability.Now, having said that,  and this has  come up  in otherdiscussions  we have had, I don't  think our  target ranges communicateanything with respect  to  our  long-run intentions.  That  is  really  theissue that  Senator Riegle  is  raising.  It has  to  do with theuncertainty about velocity and how we  have been treating theaggregates,  quite  appropriately I think.  My own view is  that there  isa good deal  of uncertainty about  those  intentions and there would be7/5-6/94-51-two  things  I would cite.  One was  a survey, and  I think  it  might havebeen discussed in  a Board briefing,  about  long-run inflationexpectations with respect  to  the G-7  countries.  I was somewhatdismayed to  see the  United States  ranked  among the high  inflation G-7countries,  along with Italy and the United Kingdom.  The averageinflation expectations  for  the  United States  in that  survey were 3.6percent  over  10  years, with four  other countries  being considerablylower.  So,  that would be one piece of  evidence  in my mind aboutconfusion with respect to what  we all  say about  being committed  tolong-term price stability and yet  having  a survey--I  don't  know howreliable  it  was--that  creates  that  sort  of  result.The  other uncertainty about  our  intentions  is  in a much morecurrent context  and relates  to  developments  since  our  last meeting.  Ithink our actions  at  the  last meeting created quite  favorableresponses  in  financial  markets, particularly in  long-term fixed  incomeif  you look at what has been  going on broadly since  then,  again it'squite disconcerting to me  in  terms  of what people  think  about ourintentions.  In effect, we have  had private-sector  forecastersratcheting up  their  inflation expectations  for 1996.  We have hadadditional  anecdotal  and other  information with respect  to  risingprices and perhaps  labor shortages  here  and there.  Yet, what  the  FOMCsaid after  its  last  action was  that we had substantially removed thedegree of monetary accommodation that  had prevailed during  1993.  Whathas  emerged  in  the meantime  is  a perception that we  breathed a bigsigh of  relief, having moved rates  125  basis points  and maybe gottenat best  to  neutral, and we were going to  rest on  our oars while  allthese  other developments were  going  on which would lead  to  higherinflation expectations  and ultimately to  higher  inflation.  In effect,we  are viewed as  having  said, I think,  that  3 percent  or  somewhathigher inflation  is  good enough as  far  as we  are concerned.Now, I understand  that all hasn't  been said and done  by thisCommittee  and over  the  longer run we will  do  the  right thing.  Butthere  are  significant  costs,  I think, to  these  sorts of perceptions,particularly  in  terms  of  longer-term rates.  Recognizing that  theaggregate  ranges do not communicate  anything about  our intentions  andthat  there  is  confusion  in  the marketplace and perhaps elsewhere withrespect  to  what  those  intentions are, my own view would be  that  it'stime  for  us  to be much more  explicit about what our  long-runintentions are with respect  to  an  inflation range  and to  indicate thatas  a practical matter  it would probably take us  a while to  achievethat  objective.  If  I did anything at  all  in response  to  SenatorRiegle's  request,  it  would be  some  sort  of  a nominal GDP  target  fromwhich one could derive  an implicit  inflation  target.  I think  if  werespond  at  all,  that  is  how we ought  to  be responding.  If  we  don'tmake  an explicit statement  in  this  FOMC  testimony with respect  to  ourlong-run expectations  on  inflation  that  goes beyond  "we think pricestability is  good,"  and get  more specific  in  terms of  a target range,then at  the  very least  I think we have  to  make  it  clear that weconsider 3 percent  inflation  to be  unacceptable and we are  not willingto accept  it.  Obviously, we have  to back  that up with actions,  but weare  going to  talk  about  that  later.  I really think  there  is a cost  tohow things have unfolded here.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.7/5-6/94-52-

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  With regard  to  the  ranges  for  the monetaryaggregates,  I certainly agree with those who  suggest  just  leaving themas  they are,  including  the debt variable.  I don't  see very much to  begained by fooling  around with those  right now for  the  reasons  thathave been cited.With regard  to the  question about  Senator Riegle's request,  Iwould be  inclined to provide  the  information  on  the  notion that moreinformation  is  better  than  less,  and also  I am not  too  troubled by  thefact  that  somebody might  look  at  those and  think that  they are  goals.Obviously, we would want  to  emphasize  that  they are projections  orforecasts and not goals,  but  some people  could interpret  themdifferently.  Presumably  if  we  weren't responding  to  a variable inthat  set  that  looked unfavorable  to Congress,  say, we would have goodreason or  reasons  for why we weren't.  We would explain  in  any eventwhat policy was  and why it  was what  it  was.  So,  I am not  too  troubledby questions  that might come up  about whether the  forecast wasacceptable  to us  or why we  were not responding  to  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, on  the aggregates  first,  I amright where I seem to  hear  a lot  of  other people  are.  For  1994,  Iwould not  change them.  I don't believe  in  changing targets  or  forthat matter budgets  in midstream unless  there's  some very, verycompelling reason  to  do so,  and I certainly don't  see  that here.  Inthe  same vein  for  1995,  I would think to  signal  a prospective changenow would require  that we have  some very clear  reason for  doing so  anda pretty  firm intention that  we will  want to  do  so early next year,and I don't see  that  now.  We may well change  the  ranges when we  getthere,  but we will  have six more months  of  experience and  facts  at  thetime  and we will  be  at  the  start  of  the period  that we areforecasting.  I see no reason  to  call  a shot  this  far ahead.With regard to  the  release of  a 1996  forecast,  by a narrowbeen cited here  for doing so--primarily along the  line of  moreopenness--are quite  significant and important, and  I don't  feel  asnegative about  it  as  I did when  I came  in this  morning.  But  I stillthink it  is  going to  be very, very difficult  to  keep people  fromascribing  a goal  to  this  forecast instead of  just  simply viewing it  asa forecast and a very soft  one  at that.  I am afraid that we wouldleave  an implication  that  we will  try or possibly can cause  thisforecast  to materialize.  Obviously, that would be over-promising whatmonetary policy can deliver.  I also  fear that  the related  thoughtprocess  on  the part of  interested people would set  up  a whole new typeof  speculation  for markets  to play with,  and they have  enough already.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, I would agree with your proposalnot to  change  the M2  and M3  ranges.  I don't  feel  strongly on  the debtissue,  but  I guess,  on balance,  I would favor reducing it  on  the samesort  of  grounds  that  we had  for  setting  the M2  target where  it  is  now.Since  debt  tracks nominal  GDP at  least  over the  very long  run, thereis  probably a case  for  trying  to make that range  fit  our  longer-runmonetary growth  objectives a little more  closely.  The  current  rangehas  a midpoint  of  6 percent, which  is probably a bit  high.  So  if  we7/5-6/94-53-lowered it,  it  would become consistent with the  rationale  I hear  yougiving  for the  M2  range.So  far  as  1996  is  concerned, I have  a good bit of  sympathywith  some of  the  things  that Governor Blinder  and Bob Forrestal  said,but  I am really in  Tom Melzer's  camp on  that.  My own preference wouldbe  to  look at  this  as  an  opportunity to make  our  longer-term goalsmore explicit  with respect to prices  and tie  ourselves  down a bit.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I would  leave unchanged the  ranges  for M2  andM3  for 1994  and 1995.  Again, I think that any change would  imply morethan we know and exaggerate  their  importance.  If  the  aggregates wereperforming properly, they would already be  set  appropriately  forsustainable growth, so  I don't  see  any case  for moving them.  Withrespect  to  debt, I can go  along with  a change  in  the range,  although  Idon't  feel  strongly about  it.  Like  Bob Forrestal,  I think that  if  webelieve  there  is  a good reason  for  doing it,  we  ought to  go  ahead andchange it,  and 5 percent  seems  a better center point  for  the  range.With respect  to  1996  forecasts,  I agree  that more  disclosureis  better.  I also  think that  if  we are  going  to  disclose more, weought  to disclose more but better  things,  and  I am not  sure  that  thenumbers  for  1996  would necessarily provide better  information.  So,I'd prefer more of  a description  of  direction or  even goals.  I knowfor myself  that  when I sit  down to  do those projections  and I look  2-1/2  years  out,  I just  don't  think that  the numbers  for  1996  representquality disclosure;  it's  quantity but  not quality.  So,  I think wewould do better with some description.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I would retain  the M2  and M3  targets  for  1994and  I would keep them  the  same  for  1995.  I think we ought  to  declarea victory on  the  ranges  that we have  for M2  and M3.  We have  them downnow to where  they are  consistent with what we want  to do  longer  term.I don't  think we are  skillful enough  at  forecasting  to  factor  in theshifts  in  demand for either M2  or M3,  and so  I think we  areessentially where we ought  to be  for  those aggregates going  forward.On  debt,  I came  into  the meeting without  strong feelings.  I stilldon't have  strong  feelings,  although I think at  the margin  there  issomething to  be  said  for  lowering the  range  for  1995.  I'd leave italone for  1994,  but  I think a lower debt range  would be moreconsistent with our ranges  for M2  and M3  over  time.  I don't  thinkit's  equivalent  to your  reference  to a  "real"  federal  funds rate.That  took a life  of  its  own because people  interpreted that as  thejustification  for  tightening.  I doubt very much whether  thisCommittee  is  going to  tighten because we  lower  the debt range  from  4-8percent to  3-7  percent, so  I just  don't think it  will come  anywherenear taking on  the same  life.  But  I don't  feel  strongly.  If  there  isa reason, and on balance  I think there  is  some  reason for  doing it,  Iwould change  the  range for  1995.As  for releasing  the projections  for  1996,  it  is  awfully hardto  recall an  instance  in this  Committee when we had a request  for moreinformation and our  initial  reaction was to  do  it.  We always have  along list  of  reasons;  sometimes they are valid and I think sometimes7/5-6/94-54-it's  just  habit.  We have  the problem of  goals versus  projections;  wehave  the  bad news  problem;  we have  the  quality/quantity issue.  If  wego  out  18  months  or  if  we go  out  30  months,  I don't  think  that  insubstance  it's much different.  I think we elevate  the  importance  ofthe  1996  projection more by not  giving  it  than  if  we give  it,  so myinclination would be to  give  1996.  I would couch  it  in your usualarticulate  way and say essentially  that  it  doesn't mean very much--youhave  a way of  saying that  very nicely.  [Laughter]

MR. PARRY.  On the  aggregates,  I would leave  the M2  and M3targets  at  their  current  ranges  for  all  the  reasons that  have beenmentioned.  I do have  a preference  for  lowering the debt range  in1995,  since  I think  there  is  a good reason  in  that we  believe  it  ismore  consistent with  the  other  ranges  we have  set.  I also  don't thinkit  would result  in  an  excessive  focus  by  the markets  if  it's  clearlyunderstood why  the  change was  made.  On  the  Riegle  request,  I don'thave  strong views, but  on balance  I  think  that  releasing our  1996forecasts  probably would not  cause problems  or create  misinformation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would prefer  just  to  leave  allthree  of  these ranges  the  same  rather  than change  them.  I don't  seeany great  advantage  in  lowering  the  debt  range,  and  it  may indeedcreate  something that  we would  find awkward  to  deal with  in  the  futureif  people  attached more  importance  to  it  than we  do.  I don't  see asignificant probability that  debt growth  is  going  to  be  outside  of  theexisting range  for  1995,  and  so  I  think the  better part  of valor mightbe  to  leave  the range where  it  is.With regard  to  the  Riegle  request,  I ask myself:  In  July1992,  what would  I have  forecast  the  economy  to  look like  in  July1994?  And I can't believe  that  there  is  any real  accuracy  in  aforecast  that  far out.  We  run the  danger of  not being  able  toforecast  accurately and then having  to explain  later  on why we were  sofar off  and why we  didn't  do  anything about  it.  If,  for example,  theforecast  says  one  thing  and the  conventional wisdom is  that  it  oughtto be  something very different,  then why are we not  doing something tomake the  forecast different.  The  forecast  is  always  going to  beinterpreted however  someone  wants  to  interpret  it  when they've  got uson  the  carpet.  If  it  was  an  attractive  forecast,  then it  will  beassumed to  have been a goal,  and if  it  is  an unattractive  forecast,  itwill  be assumed to be  an admission  of  failure.  I just  think we  areasking  for trouble  if  we get  into  something that  dicey.  I doubt verymuch that  the models  that we  are playing with here would haveaccurately forecast  in July of  1992  where we are  today.  So,  I justthink  it's  dangerous  to  get  that  kind of  thing in  numerical  form infront  of  the public.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would  leave  M2  and M3  alone.  Ibelieve  I would be  inclined  to reduce  the debt  aggregate,  and  just saythe  reason is  to make  it  consistent with the  other monetary  aggregates7/5-6/94-55-and recent  flows,  not make  a big deal  out  of  it.  I agree with thosewho  say  that  it's  not  the same  kind of  concept as  the  real  fed fundsrate, and  I doubt  that  it  would be  noticed or  remarked upon.  I wouldhope  that  the  rhetoric that  goes  with the  aggregates  would not writethem off  as being moribund but  help  keep  them alive for  their returnin  the  future because they  are very handy to have.  It's  a lot  easierto  talk about monetary policy when we are  trying to hold  on to  apreviously determined target  range than  it  is  when we  seem to beraising  interest  rates.  I would hope you would discuss  the  flowsbetween  the  depository institutions  and the  stock and bond funds  andremind people why  the  aggregates have not  done so well  recently.  Iwould prefer  that you keep alive  the  concept of  modifying M2  at  leastverbally with M2  adjusted for  bond funds,  stock  funds  and so  forth,and maybe  even go  so  far  as  to  have  an anticipated growth range  foradjusted M2.I don't know what  I think about releasing the  projections  for1996.  It  seems  that  there  are no  good options.  We do need to  be asforthcoming as we  can.  I basically agree with Jerry Jordan  that  if  weare going  to  release  them, we probably ought  to  redo  them.  They aregoing to  be treated as  our  targets.  We  are  going  to be  blamed  if weare  projecting bad things and not  doing anything about  it.  So,  at  thevery least,  I think we  ought  to  redo them  if  we  release  them.

MS. MINEHAN.  One  of  the problems of being on  the end of  thislist  of people being  called is  that  all  the  other people  say the  goodstuff!  I am also  in agreement  with the  discussion on the  Ms;  I wouldleave  them the way  they are.  I agree with the  comments,  whoever madethem, that  it  has  taken us  a long time  to  get  the  ranges down  to  areasonable expression of  long-run policy and I think they  should staywhere they are  over  a period of  time.  I am attracted  to  the idea  ofreducing  the debt  range marginally as  suggested in alternative  II.On the  issue  of  releasing our projections  for  1996,  I havesome sympathy for what  President  Boehne  said, being attracted  to theidea that we don't  know too much  about developments  18  months  in thefuture and therefore there may not be a much greater problem withreleasing further out  data that we don't  know much about.  Butweighing everything in  the  balance,  I think I am more attracted to  theargument that  if  we release very explicit  forecasts going  out  thatfar, we do  set up  expectations  that may end up  tying our hands ratherthan allowing us  flexibility  in the  future.  I would go  for the middlealternative myself,  not giving  specific hard numbers but  trying  toexplain  the  factors  that  we weigh  in  terms  of  looking at  the  longerrun.  I would be much  in  favor of  a balanced discussion of  inflation,unemployment--those  sorts  of  things.  Maybe  it  sounds  like Mom andapple pie, but I don't  know if we  all  share  the  same  specific  targetswith regard to  long-run  rates  of  inflation  and  so  forth.  So  I am alittle concerned about putting  out  something that  says  that  that  isthe  goal  of  the Committee.  I would be  concerned about  not coming outon  a reasonably balanced side.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  On M2  and M3,  don't bother  changing them.Changing the  debt aggregate range  isn't  going to  make much difference,7/5-6/94-56-but  I think we should probably lower it  because  I think  it's  a proxyfor  nominal GDP.On  forecasting, I think John LaWare had a very good point.  Iremember what happened to me  when I was  on  the  staff at  the  CEA in1982.  In December  1982,  there was a deep  recession and we  had to makea forecast  for five  years out.  Marty Feldstein, who had sort of  abaseline,  said let's  guess  4 percent a year, starting in  the  secondquarter  of  1983.  Here  is  the  dart  thrown  at the  dartboard.  It  turnedout  that  the 1987  real GDP  forecast was  off  in  fact  in  1987  by  a totalof  $3 billion, which is  as  close  to  a bull's  eye  as  I have  ever  seenanyone make.  But  in  the  meantime,  first  it  was  criticized as wildlyoptimistic,  and then  it was  criticized as  wildly pessimistic as  theeconomy went above  and below the  forecast.  So  anyone has  to  be  crazyto make  that  kind  of  forecast  even if  it  turns  out  to be right![Laughter]  Nobody ever remembers  you were  right.  At  the  very least,I think Jerry Jordan's point  is  correct,  that  this  is  going  to beinterpreted somehow as  our wish  list.  For us  to  put out numbers  thathave  unemployment  and inflation rising has  to  invite an attack.  It'sworse  than forecasting  4 percent  growth  for five years.

It  seems  to be  awfully  far out  on  theforecasting horizon, and  I far prefer  to  state our  expectations interms  of  our  long-run objectives.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I am in  favor  of  alternative  Iacross  the  board for both 1994  and 1995.  Perhaps,  living in the  citywhere  financial  journalists  swarm, I am not  at  all  convinced that, byleaving M2  and M3  alone  and changing the debt  ratio,  we would not  havemuch more discussion of  the meaningfulness  of  that move  than anybodyin this  Committee really thinks  is  meaningful.As  regards  1996,  I find myself  in  the  awkward position ofbeing  trapped in  the middle  of Alan Blinder's  syllogism.  I believe  itis  the major.  I agree that we  should be more  open  to disclosure,  butmy concern at  the present  time  about forecasting  1996  is not  unrelatedto  the  fact  that  it  is  a year  divisible by four, which may be  theinterest behind the request.  If  we ever  forecast  that  far  out,  itwould be better  that we do  it  after considerably more  discussion andthinking  than is  possible now.  So  as  a tactical matter, I prefer  thatwe not  release a forecast  for  1996.  Perhaps as  we meet  in  February orget prepared for February, we may want  to  think more fully aboutwhether we wish to  forecast  out  for a longer period.  I suspect theanswer  to  that would be  "no,"  partly because of  what Larry Lindseyjust  said.  But it may very well  be  that we need to be  somewhat moreforthcoming about just  what we mean by price  stability.  I don't havea conclusion for  that,  but  I think  it's probably a debate  that we maywish  to have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Before we  go  further,  Governor Kelley,  Ifailed  to  put down your position  on  the  debt  issue.7/5-6/94-57-

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I would leave the debt  range unchanged for now,Mr. Chairman, but  I would like  to  see  us do  some work--perhaps thestaff could give us  a paper--on  the  implications  of changing it  to  alower  level  for  consideration at  our February meeting.  I think thatwould be very helpful.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am  sorry, President  Jordan,  I didn'tget answers  to  questions  on the  ranges  and 1996.  As  I understood youon  1996,  it's  the  goals  issue.  You prefer not  to  do  that  but you dothink we  ought  to  think more  seriously about  it.  Have  I got  thatcorrect?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Yes.  The numbers  are  as  Don indicated.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You would vote  no  on  the specific  Rieglerequest?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  That  is  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And  on the  ranges?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I wouldn't  change  them  and I don't  see what  iswrong with  letting the  journalists write  stories  about  debt.  If  theywant  to write  the  stories about  the  governors  having green peas forlunch on  Thursdays and  that  is  the key  to monetary policy, I don't  seethe  harm in  that.  They have  to  fill  up  the  space anyway.  So  I don'tsee  a problem.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So you would be  inclined to  lower thedebt range.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I really don't  care  about the  debt  aggregate.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Who released that  information  on the  governors'lunches?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It  was a week after  the  lunch!

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Or was  it  the week before!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Before  we get  to  any formal  vote, let  mejust see what it  is  that we  should be  voting on.  It's  pretty clearthat  there  is  a consensus  to  leave  the M2  and M3  ranges  unchanged.The other two  issues  are really interesting.  There seems  to  be  amembers  favor that.  The Riegle request  gets  turned down, but  there isa general view that as  best we  can we should be more  forthcoming.There is  a sense  in which Humphrey-Hawkins  essentially sets  themonetary aggregates as  a signal  that could be  objectively evaluated bythe Congress with respect  to what  it  is  we  are doing.  As  the meaningof  the  aggregates  falls  away, there  is  an obligation  on our part  togive  the  Congress  some  objective criteria.  I happen to  think  that  theone requested by Senator Riegel  is potentially mischief-making, and Iam not  sure  that  it  serves  our purpose  to  do  this  in  the way in whichit  is  requested.  What I do  think we  ought  to be  saying more about  iswhat our goals are, what we  are  looking  for,  and what  our  outlook isfor  1995  and 1996  in a qualitative  sense.  I mean to  draw thedistinction between goals and  forecasts.  I would judge that  our7/5-6/94-58-forecasts  as  a group  do  not clash violently with those  of  either theAdministration or  the CBO, as  Governor Blinder  indicated.  Perhapsnoting  that  in  the Humphrey-Hawkins  text  without putting numbers  downper se would enable  us  to  associate  ourselves  with the  forecasts  andstill  talk  about broader questions  such  as  where we think  the  goals  ofthe  Committee should be without putting  the  specific  numbers  down.  Ihesitate to  think what would happen, as  Cathy Minehan said,  to  theinterpretation of  those  forecasts.So,  leaving  aside  the actual  formulation  of  this,  theconsensus  of  the  Committee  seems  to  be  that  we  leave M2  and M3  alone,that we marginally  are  in  favor  of  bringing  down the  debt  aggregaterange  and hopefully we will not  get as  a consequence  a  "real"  interestrates  type  of  discussion.  I suspect  that  there  probably is  not  muchrisk  in bringing down the debt  range;  I don't  think  it's  a big deal.Look,  if  credit  really starts  to  move,  that  might be  an  importantsignal  for  us  to  respond  to.  So,  I am not  sure  that  it  is  wrong,  inand  of  itself,  but  it  is  what  I will  put up;  we have  to  have  separatevotes  on 1994  and  1995.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr. Chairman,  I heard a marginal preference  amongthose  talking about  debt  aggregates  for  lowering  the  range  for nextyear but  leaving  it  unchanged for  this  year.

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  I didn't hear  any discussion aboutthe  debt  aggregate  for  1994.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  first  formally put  on the  tablefor  a recorded vote  that we  leave the  ranges  for M2  and M3  unchanged.Why don't  you read  that part  of  the  directive  for  1994.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I am reading  from page  26  in the  Bluebook, orif  you  are  looking at  the draft directive  version,  it  is  at  the bottomof page  2,  line  46.  The  first  general  sentence,  of  course,  stays  thesame.  "The Federal  Open Market Committee  seeks monetary and  financialconditions  that will  foster  price stability and promote  sustainablegrowth  in  output.  In  furtherance  of  these  objectives,  the Committeereaffirmed  at  this meeting  the  ranges  it  had  established in Februaryfor  growth  of M2  and M3  of  1 to  5 percent and  0 to  4 percentrespectively, measured from the  fourth quarter  of  1993  to  the  fourthquarter of  1994.  The Committee  anticipated that  developmentscontributing to  unusual velocity  increases  could persist during theyear and that money growth within these ranges would be consistentwith  its  broad policy objectives."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  We need the  debt  sentence.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We haven't  got  there yet.  In otherwords, we  can vote  on  this  and then we  can vote  on  1995.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Well,  he needs  to  read the  debt  sentence  for 1994.7/5-6/94-59-

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  All  right.  "For 1995,  the  Committee agreed  ontentative  ranges  for monetary growth, measured  from the  fourth quarterof  1994  to  the  fourth quarter  of  1995,  of  1 to  5 percent  for M2  and  0to  4 percent  for M3.  The  Committee provisionally set  the  associatedmonitoring range  for growth  of  domestic nonfinancial  debt  at  3  to  7percent  for  1995.

MR. KOHN.  I don't  think  so.7/5-6/94-60-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  I got the  consensus  for  tryingto embody many of  the  notions  that  Jerry Jordan, Al  Broaddus, and TomMelzer proposed, namely that  we provide  a general  qualitative view ofour goals  and  their  distinction from forecasts  in  reference  to policyand  try  to put  it  all  in a language  form that  says  less  than  itsounds.  [Laughter]  This  is  what we mean by  "Fedspeak."  You know,the  trouble with a  lot  of  this  is  that  language  does  matter,  and Ithink we  have  to  be  very explicit  in our  terminology and  clearlydistinguish between goals  and policy because  that  is  what  the  criticalquestion really  is  here.  I hope, putting  aside  these  facetiousremarks,  to be  clearer  on  this  issue than we have been  in  the past.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  In  fact,  could I say one  thing?  I'll  speak  formyself,  but  I think it  does reflect  the  mood of  the Committee and theactions  we have  been  taking  since  February.  With regard  to  1996,  hadwe  not been moving  this year so  far  in  the way  that we have  toestablish our current  policy stance, by  late  this year and 1995inflation would probably be  worse and  inflation psychology would havebeen  escalating  sharply, necessitating  a policy response  of  such  amagnitude  that  it  would have  depressed output  and raised unemploymentin  1996.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mean  in discussing the  forecast  for1996?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Right,  and characterizing  1996.  The uncertaintyabout  1996  is  the  effectiveness  of our  actions  in  1994.  If we  aresuccessful  in what we  are doing  in  1994,  then we  are going  to  havehigher  output  and  lower unemployment  in  1996.  And that  is  thedifficulty  in giving  them a  forecast of  what  1996  is  going  to  do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I  think we have been saying  somethingnot  dissimilar to  that  without mentioning the year.  Coffee  isavailable and we will  reconvene  in  15  minutes.[Coffee break]

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The Post  article carried an  excerpt  from  the  1987transcripts  in which  I said something  to  the effect  that, given  thelags  of  policy, we  either should  tighten or  should  ease, but  I didn'tknow which.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Well,  I am  sure  I won't  relieve any of  the  currentuncertainty here and probably will  add to  it.  [Statement--SeeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?  If  not,  why don't  Istart  off.  I think  it's  fairly apparent that  if  we move  today,  thegeneral view  is  going  to  be that  we moved in  order  to  support thedollar.  I don't deny  that monetary policy has  a significant effect  onour exchange  rate, but  I think  it's  important  for  us  to  review  justwhy it does  and what  it  means  to  alter  the  exchange rate from what  thewith a world currency  that  is  held virtually in  all  corners of  theglobe,  the world portfolio adjustment  process  is  very difficult  tounderstand at  times.  But  what  is  fairly apparent  is  that we  aredealing with  balance sheet  shifts that  essentially move towardexpected higher  risk-adjusted rates  of  return.  In  this  regard, we  arelooking not  only at  interest  rates but  at  stock prices  or any  type  ofinstrument  denominated in  dollars that  has  a rate  of  return relativeto  similar types  of  investments  in  other  currencies.  We  like  to  lookat  the  issue of  current account  imbalances  and a variety of  otherelements  in  the  flow area, but  fundamentally, the  exchange rateinvolves a balance  sheet  adjustment process.  When we are  dealing witha reserve  currency, the propensity to  hold it  in a balance  sheet  sensegenerally tends  to  override where  the  exchange rate ultimately comesout.  If  we  think in  terms  of  the  aggregate amount of  dollars growingnot only because of  current  account  deficits and  increased claims  butmore  importantly because of  a general  grossing up  in  the Euro-currencyin  the  search for  increased rates  of  return, but  basically that  iswhat dominates  the system.The  reason this  is  important  is  that  if we  get  short-termchanges in  expectations with  respect  to how the rate  of  return isgoing to  be altered, we need a very large change  in  interest  rates  orrates of  return  to offset  that.  For example, an  expectation  of  a 10basis point  capital gain  in a week on an  instrument  translates  to  anannual rate  of  5 percent,  or more  actually.  We have  learned in  thisprocess  that  it  is very difficult  to  employ  interest rates  toforestall  changes in  expected rates  of  return on  a currency.  Theresult usually has been somewhat disastrous.  We have  to  be  careful  torecognize  that  if we  employ monetary policy to  offset normal marketforces,  there have  to  be  offsetting adjustments  in  the  rest  of  thesystem.  If  we are  looking  for a classic  case  of what  type ofadjustments  occur, remember what  happened after World War I when theBritish endeavored to  restore  the parity of  sterling at  its  pre-warrate with very extraordinary effects  on  the  structure  of  theireconomy.  In  today's  environment, that  sort  of  rigid adjustment  isvery rarely seen, but  I think the principle  is  fundamentally the  same.Any attempt by us  to use monetary policy to  offset exchange rateeffects has very considerable  secondary, usually negative, effects  on7/5-6/94-62-think quite  correctly--that  to  the  extent we  affect our  exchange ratefavorably and bring inflation and inflation expectations  down as  aconsequence,  there are positive forces basically driving  the  system.That  leads  me to  conclude  that  the  fundamental  exchange ratepolicy really ought  to be  that  the best  support  of  the  dollar is  tokeep domestic  inflation down.  Exchange rate volatility createsproblems,  but  they are  different  from  those that  exist  in  stock andbond markets  where the net position is  long of  necessity.  If  massiveuncertainty hits  a market  in which the net position  is  net  long,  thendisengagement, which is  what  uncertainty produces,  of necessitycreates  selling and lower prices.  But  currency markets  are  a zero-sumgame.  If  you want  to  argue  that an  uncertainty premium inducesdisengagement  of  the dollar vis-a-vis  the yen,  then  the question iswhat  about  the yen vis-a-vis  the  dollar.  You cannot  have massiveuncertainty.  Remember, uncertainty is  not  a statement  that  somethingis  going to  happen;  it's  a statement  that  one  doesn't  know what isgoing  to  happen and is  therefore pulling back.  If we  consider thecase  in which  two people have  gross uncertainty about  long-term U.S.Treasury instruments, they both  sell  and the market  goes  down.  If  wehave  one person massively uncertain about the  dollar/yen, and theother massively uncertain about  the  yen/dollar, and  they both sell,what  happens?  So,  there  is  a limit  to  the  cumulative process withinan exchange market  that  is  different  from what exists  in  standardpositions where  there is  a net  long position  in the  system.At  this  stage,  I am  inclined  to be very careful  about makinga particular point  of  our moving in  to  support  the dollar  unless  itbecomes  crucially necessary because of  increasing financialinstability and  indeed an  end-point  game.  We  are nowhere near  that,as  best  I can  judge.  The exchange markets  were quite weak today;  thestock market  is  up;  the  last  time  I looked the 30-year  bond was down10/32.  This  is  not the  type  of  environment  in which more  than theexchange rate  is  involved.  This  is,  I should say,  an  exchange rateproblem.  It  is  a different  type of  animal  than  a broad inflationaryconcern about  the  currency in which bond markets plummet,  stockunambiguous.  At  that point,  the  central  bank has  no choice but  tomove in  and try to  squeeze out  the  inflationary bias  in  the  system.At  that point,  I grant you,  it  is  very late  in  the game  and there  is  aconsiderable  question that  the  effort would succeed, but  I would  judgethat we  are  not anywhere near  that  stage.  In  sum, I would arguestrenuously that  we should avoid being perceived  as  using monetarypolicy solely for  the purpose  of  addressing  the exchange rate.Essentially, we  have  to  look at monetary policy in  this  context  as  ananti-inflation issue.This  leads  to  the  question of  domestic policy and the  extentto which we  address  this.  In  a somewhat unusual  sense,  the  outlook isreally  intriguing.  It's  clear that  the  rate of  economic growth iscoming  down.  The question is,  from where?  As a convention, we usegross domestic product as  our broad measure  of  the economy, largelybecause the  data there are  seemingly more accurate.  But  grossdomestic  income  is  conceptually identical.  Yet  if  we  look at  thegross domestic  income in  the  fourth quarter  of  last year  and the  firstquarter  of  this year, we  see  that  it  differed from gross  domesticproduct.  For example, as you may recall,  GDP growth was  at  a 7.07/5-6/94-63-percent  rate  in  the  fourth quarter of  last  year.  Gross  domesticincome growth, which is  conceptually equivalent,  was  7.8 percent.  Inthe  first  quarter, GDP was  3.4  percent  and GDI was  4.0  percent.  It'spretty obvious,  looking at  the  employment and hours data  in  the  secondquarter, that  the growth  in GDI  is quite  likely again  to exceed  thegrowth  in  GDP when we  get  final  data  for  the  second quarter.  Thisraises  interesting questions as  to  what  the  economy  is  doing.  Whereare we?  Our  alternative  to  looking at  GDP and accepting  the payrollhours data  is  that productivity is  falling in  a rising economy.  Iknow of no conceptual  framework, other  than  a bizarre  scenario, whichwould say that  that makes  any sense.  But  the question is,  do we  trustthe manhour  figures  and the work hour  figures.  What we have  is  anestablishment  survey increase  of  about--was  it  200,000,  Mike?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Exactly right.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On  the  basis  of  the  overall data that weget  from the  unemployment  insurance  system with a significant  lag, weessentially are picking up what  the BLS  calls  the  "bias adjustment"  inthe small  business  sector.  It's probably fairly accurate going backin history.  However,  there  is  this  plugged bias  adjustment which BLSputs  in that  is  not  small;  I gather  that  it  has a 125,000  rate  ofchange  for  the  second quarter.  That  is  a monthly number  and it's  asignificant  part  of  the  200,000  to  300,000  figures  that  were publishedmonthly.  If  it's wrong by a significant  amount,  the  hours  figuresthat  we are  using as  the denominator for  the productivity  figures  arewrong.  So,  the  first problem I have with all  of  this  is  trying tofigure  out  where we are.  And the  conclusions  are,  as  best  I canjudge:  (1) the  economy is  still  moving ahead at  a fairly good pace;(2) whatever  that  pace, which is  important,  it's  slowing.  We areseeing very little  cumulative deterioration  in the  system.  We  stillhave  inventories  in  terms of  days'  supply  at very  low levels,especially when we  strip  the markup out  of  the trade  inventories anddeal  only with  factory-value  inventories.  This makes  the  inventory/sales  ratio  a lot more  like the manufacturing series.  When wejuxtapose  that  type of  series with  the evidence that we  are beginningto  get  some  delayed deliveries, we  are  getting at  least  the  earlymakings  of what  one would expect  to  see  if  inventories were turningaround.But,  as  Governor Blinder indicated yesterday, considering howstatistically close we  are to  all  these various  capacity levels, whyaren't  inventories rising more?  Why aren't we seeing  far moreanecdotal  evidence of  skilled labor  shortages?  Why are we not seeingmore evidence of  price movements  in final  goods?  Given this  type  ofenvironment,  if  I were  an  anecdotal  chronicler, I would be looking  forexamples like  those.  I am not saying  there  aren't any;  there  are  lotsof  them.  But the  fact  is,  given where we  are, the  inventory situationand  the behavior of prices  suggest  that  there  is  far more  fuzzinessout  there as  to where  the capacity constraints  are.  We  are allarguing  that  we  are getting close  to  them, but the way to  measure whenwe  are close  is  not by the  NAIRU statistics or industry operatingrates but by  the presumed effects of  that phenomenon.  At this  point,we are  still  looking  for  the  effects.  As  Don Kohn  said yesterday, theemployment  cost  index, which will  be out  on  the 26th of  this month isgoing  to  be  a very interesting statistic  to  see, because  it will  be  avery important  test  of  the  underlying costs  structure that  isevolving.  But  having said all  that,  where we are at  this stage  is7/5-6/94-64-consistent with,  as Mike  Prell might  say, either  going back down orgoing up!

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Or  going sideways!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't  think we  know how far theunwinding of  the  growth rate will  go,  leaving aside where we arestarting  from, which I think may be  higher than  the GDP  figures  areindicating.  As  a consequence,  I would be  inclined at  this  stage  tostay with  "B,"  largely because, unless we  tighten by 300  basis points,I think the  effect  on the  exchange rate would not be  all  that visible.Doing 25  or  50  basis points,  I fear,  would be viewed as  an endeavor tohit  the  exchange rate.  Once we have  done  it,  the markets  wouldswallow it  and say, okay, what  more do  we get?  The  more  tools we usewithout  success,  the greater  the danger  of  getting  a destabilizedsystem.  I would not have  any domestic concerns  at  this  stage aboutmoving the  rate  up  today because  I suspect we will  want  to move  at alater  time.  But  I am very uncomfortable  about  the  inevitable  analogyto  the  exchange rate, because  the  order  of magnitude is  all  wrong ifit  were  against the  exchange  rate.So  I would like  to  stay at  "B" unchanged, but  I'd like  to  beasymmetric.  The reason for  that  is  twofold.  One,  I am by no meansconvinced  that  this  unwinding process will  continue all  the way down.I think there  is  a reasonably good expectation,  as we have  seen  inmany business  cycles,  that we will  get unwinding pauses and theeconomy will  start back up  again.  We are going  to  learn a lot  aboutthe most  recent past  in  data to  be  reported over  the next  10  to  15days.  However,  I am not  sure what  if  anything in  those data wouldsignificantly  change our  minds.  The  only  thing  it  would do  is  that  itwould distance us  from the  issue of  the  exchange rate  if  we were  tomove, and I think  that has very considerable value.I have a suspicion  that  if  we were to  do nothing until  theif  the  economy starts to  pick up.  I am biased toward the  up  sidebecause of  the way I read what  is  going  on, but more  importantlybecause of  the  so-called  "loss  function" that we  have  discussed onpolicy.  If  we were to  move higher  in  the next  few months  and we werewrong because our tightening was more  than the  economy could take,  Ithink we  could adjust and move  back down.  There would be  costs,  but  Ithink they would be containable  and reversible.  So  if we  make amistake by being too  tight,  I don't  think the  cost  is  all  thatsignificant.  If  we  fail  to act when we  should and inflationarypressures  take off,  I think  the  cost  of  restoring our position wouldbe much higher  and conceivably  irreversible.  Merely dealing with thatloss  function and knowing nothing about  the  outlook,  I think we  haveto  be biased  toward restraint,  not  only with respect  to  theprobability that whatever actions  we  take over the next  six weeks  aremore  likely to be  up than down.  But  I do  think we have  to maintainthe  notion in the marketplace  that we  stand ready to  move  ifnecessary, but not  knee jerk  to every type or  set  of  pressures thatthe markets  can  create for  us.  I think we have  to move  in  adeliberate way.  Whatever one may say  about  the  economy, the model nowI think enables us not  to  have  to accelerate our  tightening moves,  atleast as  far as  I can judge  the  forces at work here.  I don't knowwhat will  evolve  in  the next  four  to  six weeks, but  I would feel  more7/5-6/94-65-comfortable if  the minutes  that  we release  six weeks  from today--hopefully they won't get  released before  that  inadvertently--will  showthat we were  in fact  asymmetric.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mr.  Chairman, I agree with your wait-and-seerecommendation.  When we  do  act again,  I think we  shouldn't  consider a1/4 point  change;  it  ought  to be  1/2  point, but  I think 1/2  pointright now would be premature.  We did get  a stronger first  quarterthan  we  expected, and it  looks  as  if we are  going  to get  a good numberfor  the  second quarter, even in GDP terms.  But  that  is  in  the past.We  have  seen some  signs  of  deceleration  in the  last  couple of  months,and we  don't have any  idea how  far  that  is  going  to go.  I thinkseeing some numbers would be  helpful here.  I agree with you that  atightening now would be  interpreted as  a move  in  support  of  thedollar.  I would be  against that  for  two reasons:  One  is  that  itgives  the  impression  that  we  are placing  the dollar  above  domesticconsiderations,  and  I don't  think we  should do  that;  I also agree withyou  that because  of  domestic  considerations we  wouldn't be  able  totighten enough to  do  the dollar much good.  So,  I think a show ofconfidence  in the  dollar by not acting  is probably more helpful.  It'seven possible  that we  could get  the  reverse of  the market  reactionthat we  got  in February.  In February,  I believe  that  when wetightened 1/4  point,  a lot  of market  participants  said  things must  beworse  than we  thought  if  the  Fed is  concerned.  I think it'sconceivable that  doing nothing  today would lead  to  some marketconfidence  that things  may be calmer than  the market might havesuspected.  I am not  sure of  that,  but  I think a steady-as-you-gopolicy today might be  good  for the markets.  So,  I would agree with"B."  Normally, I prefer symmetric  to  asymmetric, but  in  this  casehaving  the minutes  reflect  asymmetric  at this  stage would be helpful.And I think I'd be  inclined to  use  this  as  an  opportunity not  to makean announcement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would you view not making anannouncement  as  consistent with saying  "the meeting is  over, we havenothing to  say"  or did you want  to  just  let  it  ride?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  For this  meeting if  we have  done nothing,  Ithink I'd  just go back  to not  issuing a press release.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Don, why don't you  comment on what theother side  of  that argument  is  just  to--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr. Chairman, I was  hoping,  as  President McTeerwas  suggesting,  that we would be  in the  position by now of  havingestablished a regular  announcing time.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  2:15.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  And if  an  announcement  is  not made by that  time,it  would be clear that  no  action had been taken.  I think  I'd ask JoanLovett and maybe Joe  Coyne  to  comment.  Both of  them have  someconcerns that not  announcing would  leave people  on edge  and guessingthat something was going  on, with a result  that  could be  a bitdisruptive.  Joan.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Yes,  I think  there  is  something  to be  said forletting the market know that  the meeting has  concluded.  In terms  of7/5-6/94-66-what announcements  the  market  is  looking  for  out  of  this  Committeewhen there  is  no  action,  I have  to  say they haven't got  a  clue.  Theyknow that  decisions  on how to  handle  these  announcements  have not  beenmade and  they know the  Committee hasn't  addressed the  issue,  so  mostof  them  think that  the  Committee wants  to maintain as  much flexibilityas  it  can until  it  has  made  a decision on  that.  For now, I  think someof  them are  hoping there  will  be at  least  an announcement  that  themeeting  is  over,  so  they  can go  about  their business.  If  we  said thatwe  have nothing to  announce,  that would be  helpful.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  but  that  is  not  to  prejudge what weare  going  to do  in  the  future.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  It's  to  buy time until  the  Committee  has  had alonger discussion on  this.  That  is  what  they are  thinking.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Mr.  Chairman, there was  a subcommittee  thatlooked at  this  some months  ago.  Others  on  that  Committee might  wantto  chime  in,  but  as  I recall  there  was  a  fairly strong  consensus aftera number of  discussions  that we  ought  to  announce  only when we  changepolicy.  However,  I think today  is  a very awkward day, and whatever wedo  today, we  have to  set  the  stage  for  a  less  awkward  future.  Andwhile  I subscribe  to  the basic  notion  endorsed by the  subcommitteethat  we  ought  to  announce only  changes,  it  might be well  today  toindicate what  the  Committee's policy  is  and to  say the  Committee'spolicy  is  to  announce  only policy changes  and then  to  say the meetingis  concluded and we will  have  no announcement.  I think  that  gets usthrough  the  situation of  today but  sets  the  stage  for  the  future.When  the  announcement  time passes  and there is  no  announcement,  itmeans  there  is  no  change.  So, we  have  addressed  the  awkwardness oftoday and what  we want  to  prevail  as we go  down  the  road.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  is  an  issue here,  and  at  somepoint--it  will not be  this  meeting and  I'll  try  to  discuss  why atlunch--we  have  to be  able  to  lay out what  our new  disclosure policy isgoing  to  be.  At  that point we will  make  it very  explicit.  Thisdiscussion is  presupposing the  substance  of  that  meeting;  I didn'tmean  to  get  into  that.  We may end up deciding  to  do  something.  Imerely wanted Don to  raise  the  issue  largely  for  those who  arecommenting  on  this  because  I didn't  think  that  question was answeredappropriately.  Bob, are  you  through?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman,  I agree that  wedefinitely should not make  a policy move  today, because  I think  thereis  no doubt  whatsoever  that  the move would be  associated with aneffort  to  strengthen the  dollar.  For reasons you have cited,  Ibelieve  the  only way to  help a  reserve currency is  to  manage domesticmonetary policy appropriately by stabilizing and, in  the  longer  term,bringing  down the  inflation rate.  I believe that  any move  that  wouldmake  sense  for domestic policy, be  it  25  or  50  basis points,  would bedeemed  to be  an effort  to  strengthen  the dollar, which would  fail.Therefore, it  could well  put us  into  the  kind of  market  instabilitythat would require a sharp  increase in  interest rates,  something thatwould be  completely  inappropriate for  the domestic  economy.  As  I7/5-6/94-67-stated yesterday, I believe that  the  economy could conceivably bemoving  to  a path  that  will  bring us  sustainable  growth  and aHowever, I  think that  all  the  risks  to  that  forecast  are  on  the  highside,  that  is,  that  the  economy will  in  fact be  stronger  than that.Since we  are  quite  close  to  capacity  as  is  indicated by virtually allof  the  statements  yesterday, a  stronger  economy would almost certainlybring  increased inflationary pressures.  Therefore,  it  seems  to  methat we  should have a definite bias  toward  tightening, which says  thatwe  should have an  asymmetric  directive.  I think it's  entirelypossible, as  the  incoming data give  us  a better  feel  for what'sactually happening, that  we would in  fact wish  to make  a  tighteningmove before  the next meeting.  That  tightening move  could well  be asmuch as  50  basis  points.  Therefore,  I am very much  in favor  ofalternative  B with an asymmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me  just  say that  I forgot  to  mentionthat  I would very much  like  to  call  on  the  Committee  in a  conferencecall  if  events  are  such that  some  significant  action  is  required.  Iwould prefer  that,  implicit  in the  asymmetric directive, we  left  openthe possibility of  a conference  call  if  numbers  or events  are movingin a way  that  is  significantly  different  from what  I have  interpretedas  the Committee's general  view.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I agree we shouldn't  act on  thebasis of  strictly  international  considerations because ultimately theforeign  international  market's purchasing power for  currencies  isgoing to  reflect what  we are doing domestically.  I don't have asense  that  within  the marketplace  today  the problems  we  are  seeing inthe  international markets  are  the result  of  concerns about  futuredomestic  purchasing power.  If  I thought  the source of  the dollar'sweakness was  the U.S.  inflation problem,  then I would feeldifferently.  I would not want  international  developments  to be  aconstraint  if  I thought  a policy move was  the right  thing to  do  fordomestic reasons,  but right now I don't  see  that  domestic  reasons  callfor a move.  And I agree  that  if  we  needed  to move in  support of  thedollar, it  would have  to  be a very, very  large move.The  story that  Bill McDonough  told  last night  at  the  UKembassy dinner about  the  deflation in Japan is  correct,  important, andneeds  to be developed more  fully.  It's partly  the curse  of  double-entry bookkeeping.  They have a huge  current  account  surplus, yet  theyhave  a large  number of  banks  and institutional  investors  trying  torepatriate  capital.  This  creates problems  that have  a price effect.That  is  not  going  to go  away, and I don't  know where  it's  going  tosettle  down.  It's  going  to  keep  coming back  over and over again.  Weneed to  try  to  get people  to  understand that  the politics  of Japan aswell  as  a  lot  of  forces  at work in  that  country are  going to  result  ina  turning  inward and a need for  domestic  investment,

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can  I just  ask  for a clarification?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Does  that  affect the  rate  of  change  inthe  exchange  rate or  does  it  bring  it  to  a  different  level?  In otherwords,  if  there  is  net repatriation of  say  $150  billion a year,  isthat  consistent with a continuous  erosion of  the  dollar vis-a-vis  the7/5-6/94-68-yen, or does  it  merely specify a level  that it  adjusts  to  and stays  atuntil  that  leads  to portfolio balance?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The portfolio balance model  will  tell  you thatif you  try to  repatriate  funds  and your currency appreciates,  that  isthe way you reduce  the  foreign  share  in your portfolio.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But does  the  currency's appreciationconsistently go up  instead  of--

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  The  theory does not  give  an answer;  it  could beeither  one.  It's  one person's decision;  they all  add to  one  so weought  to  treat  everybody as  one person.  They can't  as  a group reducetheir  foreign assets because  of  constraints on  flows;  they have  toleave  those  assets  abroad.  They may add  to  them, but they have  tohave  their assets  abroad.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I don't  think you  can answer in part because youneed to  know more  fully what  is  happening on  the  trade side.  Japan aswe know is  one  of  these  economies  where  the net value  added  is alllabor  inputs  because  they import  everything else.  So  their  imports  ofraw materials,  energy, and all  of  that  give you  the price effect of  alower  dollar.  I find that  a very difficult  story to  unwind, but  Idon't  think  it's  going  to  end soon.  I don't  know if  the yen will  goto  90  or  80,  but I think we need  to articulate  the  story that  this  isnot  a problem of  the United States nor  a concern  about our  inflationand our  other  economic problems as  much  as  this  is  about Japan.Regarding  our policies,  I expect  to  see  some bad CPI numbersduring  the  second half  of  this year.  I have  no reason  to  disagreewith the  Greenbook on  that.  We talked about  this  before:  If  thestaff  is  right  that  the  CPI  less  food and energy  is  going  to  come  outaround 3 percent  or  so  this year  as  the  Greenbook specifies, we aregoing to  run  into  several months with the  CPI  getting up  in  the  rangeof  3-1/2  to  4 percent  annual  rate.  And  that being the case,  thereprobably will  be  adverse market  reactions  to  the  superficial  reportingof  those numbers.  If we are  going  to  act  at  some  time  in  the secondhalf  of  this year,  I would much prefer  to  see  our  actions  coincidewith  adverse price developments  rather than  strong real  numbers,whether  it's  employment or  output  or  industrial production or anythingelse.  It  would take  a couple  of months of  bad CPI  numbers  to make  acase for saying we  need to  act  to  show our  resolve  to bring theinflation trend back down again.  That  says to me  that before  thewould  trigger  such a move.  So,  I would be  inclined to  stay where weare at  the moment.  I would not be  inclined  to go  asymmetric.  Iwouldn't dissent  against asymmetric,  but  I'd prefer  to  stay  symmetricwith the  expectation that we will  reassess  the economy in  August andsee how the price numbers develop.As  for the announcement,  I think Ed's point  is  right.  Had wepreviously set  forth what our policies were, we might get  away with noannouncement  at  all  if  we had said  that  that  was  what we were going  todo.  But under the  circumstances,  I think we have  no  choice but  toput  something  out  this  afternoon.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  First Vice  President Minehan.7/5-6/94-69-

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  On the  matter of  policy,  I have  been impressedthat  things keep  coming  in  a bit  stronger than  expected.  I realize weare  beginning to  see  indications  of  some  slowing, probably as  a  resultof  the  actions  that were  taken earlier  this  year.  Even  so,  I  thinkthe  risks  for the  rest  of  the  year, given the  depreciation of  thedollar  and the  improvement  on the  external  side,  are more  on  the  upside  than on  the down  side.  So  the  question is  when do we purchaseinsurance,  if  you will,  against  inflation.  I would be  inclined  to  gowith your recommendation  of  not making a move  this  time,  but  I wouldexpect  the need to purchase  some amount  of  insurance  in  terms  ofincreased pressure  on  fed  funds rates  in August.  You noted thepossibility of  a  telephone conference  during  the  intermeeting period.Just  being new  to  this whole business,  if  we  go with asymmetric,  whatdoes  that really mean?  Does that mean any amount  of  movement betweennow and the next  meeting?  I know symmetric means  25  basis points.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It  doesn't?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It  doesn't mean that.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  don't have a  specific  formulation.Asymmetry merely means  a general  sense  of  the  Committee's  dispositionor  the  direction of  our  bias.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  How long we  should expect  you to  wait beforemaking  a change?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  I have  tried to  articulate  this  andI have  been much too  specific,  so  I'll  call  on  Don Kohn.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  As  I said in my briefing,  the use of  asymmetry  inthe past has  been an  expression  of  the  Committee's disposition  abouthow it  would like  to react  to  incoming  data.  If  you  think the  risksare more on one  side  than on  the other  and if  for  example  you wouldlike  to  react  to  stronger data before  you reacted  to weaker data,asymmetry would send a  signal  to  the  Chairman  that when the  data comein  a bit  to the  stronger side,  or  the data don't  suggest  a weakeningthat  you would like,  he  should give  serious  consideration  to  a firmingmove,  acting on behalf  of  the  FOMC, or  to  having a conference call.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Fine--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It's sort  of  leaning  to  one  side in  reacting toincoming  data.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  be very specific  using JerryJordan's CPI  as  the model.  Let us  assume our normal  expected CPI  justfor  the  sake  of  argument was  .3 percent  and we were asymmetric  towardtightening.  If  the  CPI  came  in  at  0, we probably wouldn't move.  Ifit  came  in  at  .6 percent,  we would tighten.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Regardless  of whether we were  symmetric orasymmetric.7/5-6/94 -70-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  I'm just  talking  about asymmetric.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Does  symmetric  tie your hands?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well,  let me give  another  example:  Saywe expect  a CPI  of  .2 percent, we  are  symmetric,  and the  CPI  comes  inat  -.1 percent  or  alternatively at  .5 percent.  This  is  a  strainedexample, but there  is  a different  disposition depending  on whether  onetakes  a specific  figure  as  being an aberration or  a more  fundamentalchange.  In  today's  environment,  if  we  saw strong  data we would, atleast  in my  judgment,  be more  inclined  to  take  the  strong data asrepresenting generally what's  going on because  everything else  looksthat  way.  Whereas  if  I saw a specific number,  let  us  assume homesales  dropped 200,000  or  something  like  that,  I would say I don'tbelieve  it;  that  figure  is  wrong.  It's  that  sort  of  thing.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Is  that fully  clear  to you?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes,  I am really  clear on  this.  [Laughter]  Iam leaning  toward  the side  of  buying  insurance  on  the up  side,  but  Iam a bit  concerned about moving  strongly  one way or  the  other  on anyparticular number.  I think  six-week  intervals are  enough  time  to  lookat  things  and see  how they shape up.  So,  I guess  I come  out  on  thesymmetric  side.  On  the  announcement  side,  I think we  would be welloff doing  what President  Boehne  suggested.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mr. Chairman,  for  all  the  reasons  that  you havesuggested  I support  the  recommendation  for  "B."  Ordinarily, I prefersymmetric  language,  but  in the  current  circumstances  I  think  it'sappropriate  to  indicate  a bias  on  the up  side,  so  asymmetric  languageis  satisfactory to me.  I think we  have  to make  an announcement.  Idon't  think we  really have any choice  on  that.  I think  the  precedenthas  been  set now and  it would be very difficult  to  avoid anannouncement at  this  particular meeting.  So  I think something has  togo  out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree with  "B"  for  the  reasonsyou indicated.  However,  I strongly, avidly am against  asymmetry.  Myreasons  are  twofold.  First  of  all,  if we  look  at  our  four moves  todate  this  year,  the most  efficient  ones with regard  to  the move  in  thelong rate  relative  to  the  move  in the  short  rate  were in May and  inrallies when we moved at  a meeting.  The next  least  efficient was  inmost  inefficient,  the  only one  in which we actually had  a bond marketselloff, was  in April  on  our surprise move--a  surprise  in  the  sensethat  it was  not  taken at  an announced FOMC meeting.  I don't  think  thenothing;  and it  will  cost  us  something on  the  long  end of  the market.Second, the question  comes up on what  data we  should move.  Idon't think we want  to move  on employment  reports  (a)  for  the reasonJerry Jordan mentioned and  (b) for the  reasons you  gave.  Youcommented  on just  how inefficient  and unclear  the  employment  report7/5-6/94-71-data are;  they are  lousy  in this  respect.  We don't know how tointerpret  them and we  should not move  on  their release.  With  regardto moving on  a price number,  I have  to  agree  with Jerry Jordan'sassessment that,  even  though  I would tend to  be very concerned, Iwould want  to wait probably for  two bad numbers before  I drew anycertain conclusions.  For example,  you stated  in  the past  that  thehomeownership  component  could move  suddenly and that would bias  thenumber.  I cannot  imagine  a single  number that would cause me  to wantto move between meetings, given the  inefficient results  we have  seento date  on  our past  four moves.  The only reason given for  doing itis--your phrase was--to maintain the notion  in  the  marketplace.  Well,in  fact,  the marketplace  isn't  going to  know anything about  it  untilafter the next meeting was over.  And given  that,  based on  currentexpectations, we probably are  going to move at  the August meeting--andI agree with your  analysis completely--I  see  absolutely nothing to  begained and quite  a bit  to  be  lost,  by an intermeeting move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can  I ask Don Kohn--I  don't disagreewith your  evidence of  the  four moves--but what  is  the history ofWould you  know offhand?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I don't know offhand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  My recollection is  that  the propositionyou state  generally is  not necessarily  true.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But has  it--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  has been true  this year, but  that  isfour observations  and you are enough  of  a statistician  to  know  thatyou need five.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think  in  the  past, Mr. Chairman,  a number  ofthese  intermeeting moves have  been made  after releases  of  data.  Themove--say, when we were in  the process  of  easing.  But  that  evidenceis  not  definitive,  I would  say.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  This is  a confusing period, Mr. Chairman.  Ithought you  laid it  out very well  in your statement.  And I guess  Ifind it helpful  in  a situation  like  this  to  stand back sometimes  fromwhat's going on currently and refocus  on  our  longer-term goals  andobjectives.  We  are  on the  record as  aiming to  gradually reduce  theinflation rate  and to  try to minimize the cost  of  doing that bystrengthening  the credibility  of  that  objective.  We have made  a lotof progress  in  reducing inflation in  recent years,  but  it's prettyclear that  that progress  is  at  least slowing, maybe stalling, and  thatwe are at  some  risk of  losing ground.  I would just briefly cite  threethings here.First,  the  economy has grown  at a much stronger pace  over thelast  three quarters  than we had anticipated earlier.  As  a result  theunemployment rate  is  currently at  the bottom of  the  range of  estimatesof  the NAIRU, as  we all  know.  Now,  in that  situation I am not at  allsure  that  the  actions we have  taken to  date  are  sufficient  to  get  the7/5-6/94-72-sort  of  steady inflation picture  and gradual  deceleration in generaleconomic activity that  the  Greenbook is  projecting.  So  far we  haveraised the  funds  rate  1-1/4 points,  and  some  outside  commentatorsrefer to  that  as  a strong  cumulative move.  But  I think  the  recordshows  that  historically it's  still pretty moderate.  The second  thingthat worries  me  is  that  I think inflation expectations  are  stuck attoo  high a level  and  they may even be  rising.  The  30-year bond ratehas  risen two  full percentage points  from  its  low point back  inbackup;  probably real  factors as  well  as  inflationary factors areinvolved.  But  it's hard  for me  to believe  that at  least  some  of  thatis  not  signalling an  increase  in  inflation expectations.  And  finallyboth the  Greenbook and I think  it's fair  to say  the  great majority ofprivate  forecasters are  telling us  we need to  raise  short-terminterest  rates  further  just  to maintain  the current  inflation  picture.In  these circumstances,  it  seems  reasonably clear to me  thatwe need to  make another  fairly strong move  toward restraint,  and Iguess  I see no  reason to  wait.  It  seems  to me sooner is  better thanlater,  and I think a good  case can be made  for  increasing the  fundsrate  1/2  point  this morning, quite  apart  from any particular  focus  onthe  dollar.  My estimate  would be  that  near-term expected inflationrates  are  somewhere between  3 and 3-1/2  percent.  That  would mean ifwe moved the nominal  funds  rate  to  4-3/4 percent  at  this meeting, wewould have moved the  real  funds  rate  from 0 to  1-1/2  percentcurrently.  I don't think  that presents  an undue  hazard to  the  economyat  this  juncture.  On  the  contrary, it  could  save us  a lot  of  grieflater  on.  At  a minimum,  I think we  should raise  the  rate  1/4  pointtoday with the understanding that  we would raise  it  promptly  furtherif  incoming  information indicates  a need to  do  that.  I don't  like  1/4point increases  generally, but  I think  that  in  the  current  situationsuch an  increase  would be  better than  none.  I am  still not  sure  Iknow what an  asymmetric  directive  is,  but  I think  I favor  it  in thesecircumstances.As  far  as  the  announcement  is  concerned,  I agree  that  we needto make some  sort  of  announcement  this morning.  A little moregenerally, let  me just  say  that  on  a couple  of  occasions  this year  inaddition  to  saying what we have done, we have had some  additionallanguage  in  these announcements.  Since  those kinds  of  statements  alsocan  affect expectations  and perceptions of policy and presumablylonger-term  interest  rates  as well,  I think  it would be good to  do  ita little more  systematically if  we  are  going to  do  that  in  the  future.Perhaps we  could have  some  alternative  announcement  language  in  theBluebook ahead of meetings  along the  lines of  the  current  inclusion ofalternative  directive  language.  But we  can address  that  later.

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman, as  I look  at  the domesticeconomy alone,  I have  a slightly different view than you do  in  thesense  that,  as  I said yesterday, I think  there  is more  symmetry therethan  asymmetry.  That  is  to  say,  in my mind the risks  are probablyfairly evenly balanced.  It's  pretty clear  from  the evidence and fromthe  discussion we have had around the  table  in the  last  day and a halfthat  the  expansion  is  moderating, and I think the  big question  iswhether  it  is  going to  continue to moderate  to  a sustainable  level,whether  it  is  going to get  down closer  to potential.  This  is  not  to7/5-6/94-73-deny in any sense  that there may not be  some inflationary pressuresthat are building.So,  I think  the best  course  for monetary policy at  the momentis  to pause  and see what effect  our actions  totaling 125 basis  pointshave had on  the  economy.  I don't  think waiting until August  16presents  any particular problem.  To  me  it's very, very clear,  as youhave indicated,  that  any move  today would be  interpreted by the  marketas  intended to  support the  dollar, and I think  that would be a mistakefor  reasons  that have been articulated by several people.  It's  alsoimportant  to  remember  that  the  basic problem with  the dollar is  notwidespread but  really with the  yen and to a lesser extent with  thedeutschemark.  Therefore,  the  inflationary effects will be minimal, atleast  in  the  short  term.  I think there is  one risk  or one problemthat may emerge from no  action  in  that  it may reinforce  the impressionheld in  some  quarters  that  the  United States  really wants  a lowerdollar and we  are following a policy of  benign  neglect.  But  I don'tthink there  is  a thing in  the world we can  do about  that  exceptperhaps  urge the  Treasury to  keep saying  things  to  the contrary.That  leaves me, Mr. Chairman, with a view that we  shouldadopt alternative B.  My preference would have been  for symmetrybecause  of my view of  the  economy.  However, if  we  are going  to  err,  Iwould prefer  to  err on  the up  side, and therefore  I can support  anasymmetric  directive.  I also  think that we need to  make anannouncement today, but  we  face  a dilemma  in  that we have not  yetdealt with this policy announcement  question.  It  would be veryhelpful  to  get  that  settled soon and inform the market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, I would  support  alternative Bbecause  I think  the extent  and duration of  the  moderating growth areuncertain at  this point.  I do  think, though,  that we may receiveinformation in  the next  several  weeks that will  indicate more  clearlywhether  this moderating is  going  to  continue,  or  if  we are going  tofollow a path that  is  more closely aligned with that  of  the Greenbook.From my viewpoint  if  there  ever was  a good  time forasymmetry, this  is  it.  I also  feel  that having  a conference callperhaps  toward  the end  of  the month is  a good  idea.  It  would give  usan opportunity to  review some  of  the  statistics  that  are  coming out,but in addition it  would be an  opportunity for you  to  share with ussome  of  your own views  about  the  testimony, which will  have beencompleted as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I forgot about  that;  that is  animportant  point.  It  might be useful,  irrespective of  what is  goingon, just  to  have a telephone  conference after Humphrey-Hawkins.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Right.  As  far as  an announcement is  concerned, Ithink one is  probably necessary following  this meeting.  It  seems  tome that  to  announce the  fact  that  the meeting is  over  is  subtle  enoughthat I am  sure markets  could deal with that!Finally, unless  I am missing something,  the discussion aboutwaiting until  a bad CPI  number comes  out  is  one  I am very troubled by.It  seems  to  me that  we  spent  the  last  six months  telling people  that7/5-6/94-74-we can't wait for bad inflation news  before we  act,  that  it  takes  12to 18  months  for policy to  have  an  impact  on inflation.  The  tactic  ofwaiting until  a bad number  comes  out,  for whatever purpose, is  just  anincorrect  approach.  In  fact,  such a number probably would be one  Iwould want to  react  to  least.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I have  a lot of  sympathy for  the views  AlBroaddus expressed earlier.  In  terms  of  reasons  to  act,  the dollar  isnot  a reason to  act.  I think  there  is  information  in the  behavior ofthe  dollar.  I accept what Jerry and others have  said about  thedollar/yen, but  I think there  is  a depreciation going on more broadlyon  a trade-weighted basis.  Basically, markets are  going  to  set  thoselevels,  and we certainly  are not  going to  set  them  throughintervention nor  for  that matter  in  the  short  run  through policyactions.  In  the  long  run, as  you said earlier, Mr.  Chairman, ourpolicy actions matter  a lot.  Secondly,  I agree with what Bob Parryjust  said:  Incoming data are not  a reason  to  act now, particularlyreal  data, but  even price data.  I think  the  reason  to  act  is  to  keepinflation  and inflation expectations  from rising  and ultimately tomake  further progress  toward price  stability than we have managed  toaccomplish  so  far.  What  I have been looking  at  for  some  time, and  Imentioned  this before,  is  that we  have a very large monetary stimulusput  in  train  over the  last  three years  that  we have  to  offset.Really, all we have  done in  our own words  is  to  get back  to  a neutralpolicy.  I continue  to  think  that markets  are  sitting there  looking atwhat we  have  said, looking at  what we are  doing, and saying  that  3percent  or higher  inflation  is  okay with  the FOMC.  From their pointof  view, if  they think they  have  figured  it  out,  it's  okay with themtoo;  they will  just  go with the  flow.  But  I don't  think  in  the longrun it's  okay for the  country.  So as  far as  I am concerned the  soonerwe change  that perception the  better off we will  be.Where I come  out  is  that  I would move  at  least  asaggressively as  we did last  time.  I'd move the  funds rate  up  50 basispoints,  and I would couple that with an  increase  in the  discount rateof  50,  maybe  even 75,  basis points.  I would use  the  discount rateannouncement  to make  it  clear that  we are  acting because  of  concernsabout  domestic  inflation and by implication not  to  defend the dollar.I might  just  say--now obviously I am interpreting events  differentlythan others,  so  please  take  that  into account--that  from myperspective, not to  do  something that  is  fundamentally called forbecause of  a concern about  the perceptions about  it  is  not a goodreason not  to do  it.  We  ought  to do what's  right  and we ought toexplain why we did  it.To  conclude,  as  I assess  things  and look at  the  risk-rewardtradeoff,  I think there  is  little  risk of  somehow derailing thisexpansion.  There  is  a lot  of momentum out  there and I don't  think  50basis points  is  going  to  derail  it.  As  I said before, the  incomingmonth-to-month data  on  the real  economy are  not  important  to me atthis  juncture, although obviously  they are over  longer periods  oftime.  I think  if we did move,  it might allow us  to  get  ahead of  thisinflation process.  Now, we  could well have  some  development over  thenext  week or  two  that  even in  the  short run would make our  job a greatdeal  tougher  than  if  we act  right now, which I think is  a riskassociated with waiting.7/5-6/94-75-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I favor staying where we  are today both  forinternational  as  well  as  domestic  reasons.  I agree with yourobservations  that we would have  to have a very  large bullet to  becredible  in  terms  of  the  dollar,  and I don't  think we  ought to  usethat  today;  it's much wiser to  keep  our powder dry and wait  for  a moredemanding day.  Hopefully, that  won't  come, but  I think  that  is  whatwe  ought to  do.  On the  domestic  economy, we  are  moving  from a highergrowth path to  a lower  growth path.  And I think  we need to  have abetter  sense  of  the magnitude of  that adjustment  and where we  arelikely to  end up before we make  an additional move.On the  symmetry/asymmetry issue,  the vaguer that  concept  themore  comfortable  I am with it.  The  more we  try to  define  it  and getspecific  the  more uncomfortable  I become.  So,  this notion ofindicating a kind of  disposition  in a vague  sense  is  fine.  I think,however, that  all  too  frequently in  the past  asymmetry has  allowed usto  key monetary policy on a particular statistic.  We  have had a runon  employment numbers,  for  example,  over  various periods.  The marketswould anticipate  that  first  Friday  of  the month,  and they would movebecause they were trying  to  guess  how we would move.  That  is  not  thekind  of  situation  that  we want  to  get ourselves  into.  I think weshould react  to  a total  evaluation of  how we  see  the  economy ratherthan a particular number on a particular  day.  So,  as  I heardefinitions  of  symmetry and asymmetry that  lead us more  towardreacting to  specific  statistics,  the  less  enthusiastic  I am about  it.However, if  I were voting  today,  I could vote  for  either  symmetry orasymmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Mr. Chairman,  I came  to  the  meeting  in favor  ofalternative B with a bias  toward  tightening.  I think you made a verystrong case  for  that  choice, and  I certainly support  that.  Even so,  Iwould slightly favor  symmetric  language, not because  I think anasymmetric policy is  an  inappropriate  stance--I  think our next move  islikely to be  toward tightening--but  because  I just am not  sure whatasymmetric  language  really buys  for  us.  On  the other  side of  thatcoin, we have had some bad experiences,  it  seems  to me, withasymmetric  language.  May of  last year comes  to mind in  that  context.So,  as  long  as  we have  a good sense  as  to  what we want  to do  withpolicy, I think that  is  all  we  really need to  operate.  Therefore,  Iprefer symmetric  language, but  I don't  feel  that  strongly about  it.In  terms  of  the  announcement, it  is  a bit of  a dilemma, but  the  choicethat  Ed Boehne suggests  seems  to  be a good way of dealing with thatparticular problem.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I support  your suggestion, Mr. Chairman, with"B" asymmetric.  As  far as  an announcement goes,  I like  Ed Boehne'ssuggestion also.  I would like  to add that  I don't  think  it'sdesirable  that we  tie ourselves  into knots here  trying  to  defineasymmetry.  It's  not  necessary for us  to  achieve precision there.  Tome,  it's  just  a broad indication  of  a bias, or  a leaning, or  aconcern, or whatever qualitative word you want  to use,  and that  is7/5-6/94-76-quite adequate  and quite useful  to have  available.  I am comfortableto  leave  it  at  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  For the moment  I am pretty comfortable with wherewe are  as well as  with  the way  I see  things unfolding.  So  I wouldfavor  alternative B with  a symmetric  directive, which is my usualpreference.  Having  said that,  I do  think we need to be careful here,though that  is  hardly new for monetary policy.  There  has been a lotof  talk--Al  Broaddus  touched on this--to the  effect that  we have movedquite a bit  and we  have  moved early and so  on  and so  forth, but myreading  of  the  historical  record suggests  that  this  is  neither a largemove nor a particularly early move.  Now, other  things are  different,of  course, that have  to  do  with the  economy--the  stance  of  fiscalpolicy, and other things  that  we can enumerate.  But I think we  oughtnot  to believe  some  of  the rhetoric  that  is  out  there about  the waypolicy has  acted so  far.  We probably have not behaved as  atypicallyas  at  least  some  commentators have  suggested, and  that suggests  to methat  over  time we may well  have  considerably more  to do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I would point out  that even ourmore pessimistic projections  suggest  that  the economy is  continuing  tobuild some  inflationary pressures  and that  they will occur  through  theend  of  the year.  And so  I think there  is  a need to  move.  It's not  amatter  of  whether but when.  I agree with you in  the  sense  that  Ithink doing so now would get  things confused as  to why we  are doing  itin  terms  of  the  international  market.  The law  of  unintendedconsequences might  take over and we could have  some  further problemsfrom that.  With that  in mind  I would be  inclined to  take  the  "B"alternative with asymmetry  toward  tightening, and would look  for anopportunity  to  do more.  I have  no problem  about  doing so  in  theintermeeting period if  we have  the  opportunity.  As  far as  announcing,I'd say we are  down that  track, and we  need to  announce.  I think theannouncement  should be very brief  and it  should  say at most  that  noaction was  taken.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think that  alternative B, which is  to  donothing right  now, is  the prudent  course.  When you are  into the  gameof  fine-tuning, which we  are  forced into once we get  this  close  tocapacity, there  is  always  a danger  of  oversteering.  I think we  shouldbe mindful of  that.  I see the  risks, as  I think Bob Forrestal  and EdBoehne  said,  as  fairly balanced, and we need to  know a little moreabout  how much of  a slower gear this  economy is  going into  right now.Since  the last  FOMC meeting, interest rates  are up a tad;  money growthrates  are  down;  reserves  have now been  falling  for  three months  or  so;and the  economy is  giving off  a feeling of  a slowdown.  It's  also  thecase that  fiscal policy, which hasn't  been mentioned, was  moving  intoits  maximum contractionary phase  in  the  first half of  1994,  and it  tooworks with a lag,  although not  quite as  long a lag as monetary policy.Even  though I think the  risks are quite balanced now, Ibelieve  it  would be useful  to  go asymmetric  in  order  to cock the  gun,so  to  speak.  The  asymmetry now says,  I think, that we view it  as7/5-6/94-77-extremely unlikely that we went  too  far in doing 125  basis  points;that  it's  modestly likely that  we  have  to  go  further;  but  combinedwith not doing anything now, that we  are now in  a waiting mode to  getmore  information about  the  economy, because we  are not  quite sure.  Itleaves open  the  possibility that  the  125  basis points were  enough, butit  expresses  the view that  there  is  some considerable  likelihood thatmore will be necessary.  I don't  think--picking up  on some  of  theother  threads of  conversation--that  this decision should be  triggeredliterally on any  one number, be it  CPI,  employment, or  anything.The other  thing I wanted to  say  is  this:  It was  mentionedthat  the markets will not  know tomorrow whether we went  asymmetric  ornot, which is  true.  But we  are  in  this  game  for  a lot  more than nextweek.  Roughly 45  days  from  today the  decision will be made public,and I think  this asymmetric  directive, if  we  adopt  it,  will  feel  rightin  terms  of  the broader  strategy that was  started in February.  Itwill give  the  impression  that  the  Fed had a general  long-run strategy,was pursuing  that  long-run strategy, and was  ready to  act  ifnecessary.  Now, it  might  in  fact be  that we do  act  in August  or  atthe  following meeting,  or  it  might be that we  don't.  But  I think  theasymmetric directive is  the  right message  to  give  45  days  from nowrather  than now.With regard  to  the  announcement,  I certainly  strongly joinwhat  seems  to be  the  consensus  that we really have  no choice but tomake  some kind of  announcement.  Here  I agree,  I think, more with AlBroaddus and Tom Melzer  that  saying something about  what we  are up  tois,  generally speaking,  a good thing.  Now, we probably don't want  totry to  draft  something  around the  table,  so  if  we  want  to  make  anextremely terse  announcement  now that  says we didn't  change thepressure on  reserves or  something like  that,  I wouldn't  oppose  that.But  thinking  a little  longer  run about  operating procedures,  I thinkthe release  of  a few  sentences pertaining to  the policy decision wouldnot be  a bad thing after  each  FOMC meeting and probably would be  agood thing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Larry, what was your  view on  theannouncement?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I  think we have  to make a terse  announcement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Well,  based on what we  know now, I think thatwe  will have to  tighten more at  some point.  I really don't  see  thecase now for  1/4  point moves,  so when we  do move  I think  it  should be1/2  point.  I don't  think our moves  should be  prompted by foreignexchange situations, against  the yen specifically.  I can go  alongwith a pause  for now, which would be the  "B" alternative.  I ambecoming increasingly skeptical  of  asymmetric  directives,  I guesspartially because it  seems  the  definition always  changes  as  to whatasymmetry is,  depending  on  the  circumstances.  So,  I worry a bit  thatwe are  injecting more  uncertainty into  the market by leaving  open thepossibility of moves.  Having  said that,  I do  think  it's  becomingincreasingly clear  that we will  have to move on  the  tightening side.So, while  I prefer symmetry,  I probably would not vote againstasymmetry.  I think  that  a short announcement  at  this point would beappropriate.  I would  like  to  get to  the  final decision  on what our7/5-6/94-78-policy is  on announcements because  I think  it  is  probably appropriatethat we adopt  this  approach of  using a  few  sentences.  But since  wehave not established a policy at  this point,  I'd  go with a terseannouncement  just  to  get  us past  this period.

END OF MEETING*Secretary's note:  At  the  end  of  this meeting, Mr. Lindseyindicated  to  Chairman Greenspan  that his  dissent  on  the  operationalparagraph was based on  a possible misunderstanding of  the implicationsof  the bias  in  the  directive.  His  dissent was  from a directive  thathe  perceived as  calling  for a more or  less  automatic  tightening ofpolicy during  the  intermeeting period.  On  the understanding  that  anytightening during the  intermeeting period would depend on  furtherindications  of  inflationary developments,  Mr. Lindsey  requested thathis vote be  recorded in  the minutes  as  in  favor of  this  policy action.Chairman Greenspan agreed  that  his  request was  appropriate.
