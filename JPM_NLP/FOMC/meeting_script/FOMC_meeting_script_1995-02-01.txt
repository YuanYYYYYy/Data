[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  staff  hascirculated, or  actually recirculated,  to each of  you a memo  from  thesubcommittee that was prepared in August;  it was  accompanied by  alengthy and more recent  memo from Virgil Mattingly on certain  legalaspects.  I am not going to  summarize  those memos;  I just want  to  saya few words.  What  is before  you today are proposals  from  thesubcommittee calling essentially  for  the  ratification, with someexceptions--I  am going to  come  to  the exceptions--of what  has becomethe  de  facto  status  quo but has  never actually been adopted as  apolicy of  this  Committee.  The de  facto status  quo has  evolved  sincethe existence  of  the  taping system was  revealed in  the  fall  of  1993and the prompt announcements  of policy actions were started inpolicy to  a formally adopted policy, and we  formalize and enunciatethings,  that  is  a time  for  clarifying and  tying up  the  loose  ends  andin  some  sense  committing to  staying with such  a policy--not  foreverbut  for  some period of  time.  In  that  sense, our policy merits  somediscussion.  There  is  only one  thing that  I think is  an  important newwrinkle  in this  document.  That  is  the matter of  concurring statementsto  the minutes, which I will  say a few words  about  in due  course.The overall  philosophy of  this proposal  is  that  the  centralbank's  independence  carries with it  a corollary  of  accountability.Perhaps--I  will put  in  the  "perhaps" to  make  sure  everybody agrees--the  Federal Reserve has  not quite  acquitted itself  of  thisresponsibility of  accountability, at  least  not  as  well  as  it might.In particular,  the public has  a right  to  know more about what  theFederal Reserve  is  doing and why it  is  doing  it.There are  three  principal  things  in  the proposal.  The  firsthas  to  do with announcements.  This  issue must be relativelynoncontroversial because  we have been doing it  since  February 1994.As. far  as  I know, everybody seems  to be  relatively happy with thepractice of  announcing our decisions promptly.  Furthermore,  it  ishard to imagine  how we could avoid doing  so  as  long  as  interest  ratesare the  target.  That seems  to  lead ineluctably  to  the  conclusion thatwe should continue making prompt announcements  of  policy changes.There  is  an  issue  here that has  to  do with the  statementsthat  we make about  the policy being adopted rather  than just  sayingwhat the policy  is.  I think there are  two questions:  How often willwe make  statements explaining  ourselves, and how detailed will  thesestatements be?  Very briefly on  the  "how often:"  The  subcommitteereached  a majority opinion  on  the recommendation  that  we ought  to makea statement when we  change policy--in this  case  that means  changes inshort-term interest  rates--and not make a statement when we do notchange policy.  I must confess  that  I was more  favorably  inclined tomaking  statements, period, but  the majority of  the  subcommittee,  threeout  of  four of  us,  clearly  favored statements  only on  interest ratechanges.  That  is  the committee's  recommendation--the  subcommittee's,excuse me.  I may occasionally  lapse  into calling  the  subcommittee  acommittee.A slightly more interesting question, perhaps,  that meritssome  short  discussion here but  that  cannot  literally be  resolved ishow detailed these  statements  ought to  be.  The statement  thataccompanied our  May action,  and included a change in  the discountrate, had what  I would call  one substantive sentence.  I am  not1/31-2/1/95-4-counting the  usual  boilerplate--the Federal  Reserve Board  acted onrecommendations  of  such and such Reserve  Banks  and the  explanation ofwhat a discount rate  is.  There was  one  sentence of  substance  thatsaid something about  the  reasons  for  the  actions.  In  the Augustannouncement,  there were  three  sentences  of  substance.  If  I remember--I hope  Don will  correct me  if  I am wrong--the November statement hadnone.  It  announced the  decision;  it  had only the boilerplate.  I ampretty sure  that  is  right.  Those are  the  last  three  announcements wemade without  enunciating any  formal policy on announcements.  Thesubcommittee discussed this  issue  to  some  extent.  Not surprisingly,we could not reach a consensus  for  many reasons,  including the  factthat  it  is  hard to define what  a consensus  is.  I think the onlyuseful  thing would probably be  for  the Chairman, who will  be thedrafter  of  such statements,  to hear  the views of  the members--to whatextent  do we want  to  say something  and to what  extent do we not wantto  say anything.  I don't believe  it  will be possible to  enunciate  aclear and crisply defined policy on  this  issue.The  second  issue has  to  do with tapes  and  transcripts.  WhileI think many people  believe that,  in  the  abstract,  it would be betterif  the  taping  system did not  exist, it  was  the  unanimous  view of  thesubcommittee  that we  have the  taping system now and we  ought not  to beturning  it  off.  The  issue  here  is  whether  there  should be  an  "off  thetape"  portion  of FOMC  meetings.  This would afford the  opportunity todiscuss nonmonetary policy matters with the  tape  turned off.  Therewas  a feeling  that  there probably was  a case  for  that.  A slightnuance mentioned in  the  report is  whether we want  to  construe this  as"the  tape  is  almost always  on  and  occasionally turned off"  or  "thetape  is  off except when monetary policy  is  being discussed."  Thereis,  of  course,  a third alternative and that  is  not  to  turn  the  tapeoff  at  all,  which  is  in  fact  the  status  quo under which we areoperating  right now.On transcripts,  the  subcommittee again recommended ratifyingthe  status quo, which  is  to  release  them after five years,  edited moreor  less  exactly as  they are now--no  change  from current policy.  Theone new wrinkle  that bears mentioning  is  dealt with  in some  detail  inthe  Mattingly/Baer memo  that  is  in  front  of you.  It  has  to  do withthe potential  danger  of a premature,  let me  call  it,  release of  thetapes  or  the  transcripts  in response  to a subpoena from  a certainnumber  of members  of  the Government  Operations Committees  in the Houseand the  Senate.  At  the  time  the memo was  written, the  number wasseven members  in  the  House  and  five  in  the  Senate;  but  it  may bedifferent  now.  The  issue  is  that  it  is  a finite number, notnecessarily the majority, of  the  members of  those committees.  Theconclusion of Virgil's memo was  that  in  fact  there was  such  a danger.The conclusion of  the  subcommittee was  that  that  did not change  ouris  now, much as we would regret a successful  subpoena that  wouldactually get hold of  these tapes prematurely.The  third issue is  the minutes.  We basically recommendcontinuing the minutes  essentially as  they are now.  The  operationalcontent  of  that  recommended action  is  that  they would continue  to bewritten without  attribution of  particular  thoughts  to particularpeople.  We would add the  option of  concurring statements  byindividual  members.  I want  to  stress  that  it  is  an option;  nobody  isgoing to  be asked to  put  in  a concurring  statement  just  to make  the1/31-2/1/95minutes  longer or because  it  seems  like a nice  thing to  do.  So,  ourrecommendation is  to  leave  concurring  statements  as  an  option forthose members  of  the  Committee who wish  to  avail  themselves  of  it  onan  ad hoc,  meeting-by-meeting, person-by-person basis.  The virtues  ofthis  seem to  me,  and indeed  to  the  subcommittee,  to  be  three.  Thefirst  is  an  increase  in  Federal Reserve  accountability as  it  relatesto  the  quantum of  information about  the  Federal  Reserve's policiesthat  is  received by  the public.  The  second advantage  is  that  thesestatements can potentially serve as  a halfway house  between agreementand dissent.  That  is,  there may be  times  when a member of  theCommittee  is  basically willing to  go  along with the  decision, but  thatmember may not be  entirely happy, for  example,  with the presumablyvery brief  statement that  the  FOMC  issues at  the  time--if  indeed thereis  a statement--and may wish  to put  some  sort  of nuance on  theassenting vote.  A concurring  statement makes  it  possible  for  a memberto  say something without  dissenting,  if  that member  wishes to.  Thethird advantage,  I think,  is  an operational  advantage.  Having theseassenting statements will,  I believe, make  it  much easier  in practiceto  leave  the  drafting pencil  for  the  Committee's  official  statement  inthe  hands of  the  Chairman without  having  to worry about  19  peoplearound the  table  deciding whether  the verbs  and adjectives  suit  them.The proposal  is  to  let the  Chairman write that  statement  exactly as  hesees  fit,  and a person or persons who want  to put a somewhat  differentlight  on  their  decision would have that  as  their option.Those are the  three  things  in  the proposal.  I should add onemore  that  is  not  in  the document.  I have discussed  this  with  theChairman, though not  recently.  So  this  will  come  as  a bit  of  asurprise;  I thought  of  this  again  last  night.  It  is  the  issue  of  theblackout period.  We  now have a symmetric blackout period  of  one weekbefore and one week after  a meeting.  This  made a certain amount  ofsense  under the  old policies.  Most people  think it  makes very littlesense under  a policy  of announcing the  interest  rate  changeimmediately.  The suggestion  is  for  an  asymmetric blackout period,including  a more  limited or no  blackout period after  a meeting;  but weof  some  sort  seems  in order.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think you  suggested aone- or  two-day blackout  after each meeting when we talked about  this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No.  Actually  I am agnostic  on  the wholeissue because  I really have not given  it  enough attention.  I would bevery curious  to  hear what  the  members have  to  say.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  So,  I would also  like  to put  that  on  the  table.There  is  no proposal  from the  subcommittee  on that  issue.  I think  Ihave now put  everything out  on  the  table.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do you want  to go piece by piece  and seewhether we have  a consensus?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER. Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  will be useful,  I think, if  we  justhave  individuals raise  specific  questions relevant  to  each of  theissues  that  you outlined.  Then, at  the  end of  the  discussion, we  cansee whether  there  are  significant qualifications or dissents  from  thesubcommittee majority.1/31-2/1/95

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Do  you want  to  go  issue by  issue or  around  thetable person by person?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  issue by  issue.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Okay.  Why don't we  take  the  question ofannouncements  first.  I reported our proposals in  the  inverse order ofhow much discussion I thought  the Committee would want  to  give  them.The  first  is  the  issue  of  announcements, where  the proposal  is  to makeprompt  announcements  of  each  interest  rate  change  and not  to  make anannouncement when the change  in  interest  rates  is  zero.  Then, as  asubquestion,  it would be helpful  to  get  some  guidance or  some  feelingfrom the  Committee regarding how detailed these  announcements  ought  tobe.  This  piece of  paper says  that Bob Parry is  first.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  With  regard to  announcements,  I think  it  is  clearthat  we ought  to  continue the  present procedure.  What  I would be alittle concerned about would be  too much detail  in  the explanation.  Ithink we have been pretty well  served by  the practice  of  explainingthe  reasoning but  keeping it  quite short.  I don't  see much advantagein providing a detailed statement.  There would be  the  issue  ofwhether we would get  a consensus  on  it  as well.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  On  the  announcements,  I certainly agree  thatwe  should continue to  announce policy actions  immediately.  Withrespect  to  the  statements  that accompany  these announcements,  I havemixed feelings  about  the  subcommittee's  recommendations.  Frankly,  Ihave  some  reservations--not  about  announcing our actions--but  aboutmaking accompanying  statements because  it  is  so  easy  for people  tomisinterpret  them no matter how carefully we write  them.  As  TomMelzer points  out  in  his  letter that we  all  received, the  rationalesupporting an action  is  going to  be released  in a fairly short periodof  time  anyway.  If we  do decide  to  continue to make  such  statements,I think we ought  to  think a little about how they get prepared.  Weknow  from experience with discount  rate  announcements  that  thestatements or  explanations  that  accompany these  actions  have amaterial effect  on market  reactions, mainly because  they clarify whatthe  action may signal  with respect  to  what we  are going to do  in  thefuture,  whether  it  is  the  first  of  several actions  or  the  last  actionof a series or whatever.  The record  on  this  is  pretty clear.  We havedone  a good bit  of  research on  discount rate  announcements  at  ourBank, and some  other research has been done  elsewhere.  So,  I thinkthat point  is  well documented.Consequently, and I certainly mean no  disrespect to  theChairman, but  given this market  impact,  I think  the  full  Committeeshould be  involved in preparing these  statements.  I am well  aware ofthe  problem  of having  12  or  19  people  around  this  table  trying towrite these  statements  in detail,  but we might be able  to  cut  throughthis  by asking  the  staff,  perhaps  in  the Bluebook, to  include  in  itsdiscussion of  alternative  policy actions perhaps  a couple  ofalternative  statements  that might go  along with each alternative  thatinvolves  a policy change.  The  format  that might be  followed is  thatthe  alternative  statements  could give  some  sense of  what  theCommittee's  stance  is  going  to  be  after  the  action  is  taken, whether1/31-2/1/95it  is  symmetrical  or  tilted in  one direction  or  another.  In  any case,I think we  ought  to  give  that  some  consideration.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  First  of  all,  I favor making  statements onlywhen there  is  a change  in policy, not when there  is no  change.Secondly, I am comfortable  leaving it  up  to the  Chairman's  discretion.I could imagine,  for  example,  a change  in policy where the  Chairmanmore would be appropriate.  But  I think ultimately it  has  to  be at hisdiscretion.  From time  to  time  he may want  to  consult with theCommittee, but  I would not make  the  consultation obligatory.The  one  concern I have  about  statements  relates  to  thepossibility that  they may take  some  flexibility away  from  theCommittee in  the  future.  We have  to be very  careful  about that.Otherwise,  the  language becomes  subject to  negotiation because  it  ispredisposing what we  may or may not be  able  to  do  in  the  future.  Thestatements  have to  be  very carefully drafted in my view so  as not  totake  that  flexibility away.  I do not  think that  the  opportunity forassenting  statements  really offsets  that because once  that publicstatement  is  made, an  expectation has  been  set  in motion  in  thegoing to  make any difference  in altering those expectations  or  reallygive  any  solace to  an  FOMC member  who  feels  that  the  Committee'sflexibility has been  compromised by  the  statement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Tom, may I just  ask you a quickquestion?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You are  raising a tricky problem.  AlBroaddus is  saying that  their research,  and  I suspect  most otherresearch,  indicates  that there  is  content with  respect  to  futureactions embodied in the  statements.  If  you want  to  leave  fullflexibility  for  the Committee  for  the  future,  then  by definition theannouncement cannot have  that  content.  The  question essentially getsto  the  issue  of  whether you want  the  statement  to have  forward-projecting content.  If  you have  that,  then Al's point about  theCommittee  having a voice  in  its  drafting clearly  is  a matter  ofmaterial importance.  If  it  has  no  content or  it  leaves  fulldiscretion to  the  Committee, which  I would guess  is  what you aresuggesting and what  a normal  statement is  supposed to  do,  it  reallyshould be backward-looking;  it  should not be  forward-looking unlessthere  is  a specific policy that  the Committee wants  to convey.  Ifthere  is no  forward content  to  the  statement,  then  it  is  a matter  ofindifference whether  I write  it  or not.  But  I do  think  that thisin that  statement,  not who does  it.  Do we want  any  forward-lookingcontent or  do we want  a retrospective  statement  that  effectivelycaptures  the  reasons  that  led up  to  the particular decision?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  What  I would want would be  the  latter, what  youjust described--a description  of  our rationale  for  taking  the action.1/31-2/1/95

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  we are  successful,  the  correlationsin Al's  studies  should go  to  zero--theoretically.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I doubt  that  we could do  that.  It would behard.  These  things are  read and parsed very carefully, and whateverwe  say  to  explain what we  did by reference  to  the past,  even  if  wedon't mean it  to,  will be  interpreted as having  some  implications  forthe  future.  If we now make  an  interest rate move  and  say not  a singleword,  a thousand people  around  the world will  start  saying what  thatmeans  for  the  future just  from the  size  of  the  move, how it  wasrelated to previous moves,  and a whole variety of  other things.  Ithink the  reference  to  the  future  is  always  implicit.  To  what  extentwe make it  explicit  is  a kind  of  art  form.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  has  been our usual practice  to readthe draft  statement  to  the  Committee.  The purpose  of  that  statementis  to  capture  the  essence of  the  Committee's reasoning.  I think it  iscrucial  to  avoid the  optional  differences  in phraseology that we  allhave,  which I think is  impossible  to do  with  19 people  or  12  people.Unless  somebody objects,  I think the  current  practice seems  to  beworking reasonably well.  What  I try  to  do when I write  the  statementis  to anticipate who  is  going to  object when  I read  it  to all  of  you.In general,  I have been  forecasting  reasonably well.  What  does  haveto  happen, however, is  that  the  statement  that  is made  has  to  bevetted  to  the  Committee  before  it  becomes public  so  that  if  there  areobjections,  it  is  important  for  them  to  be on  the  table  and getaddressed.  But  I would  strongly recommend that  the  Committee as  awhole not  try  to  write the  statement  because  the meeting will  go  onand on.  It  is  like writing  a communique  at  an  international meetingwhere  the  communique  can take  four-fifths  of  the  time  of  the meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think what you  just  said is  exactly what  thesubcommittee  had in mind.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would anybody object  to  this  as  aprocedure?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  It would be  helpful  if  we had a chance  to  lookat  the  statement  in  draft  form and make  whatever comment  we  deemimportant.  Just very briefly, in  the  research on  the  discount  rateannouncements--it  is  not  exactly analogous--some researchers  havetried to  distinguish between alignment  announcements,  which really donot have  any policy content and talk about moving  the  discount rateback  into alignment  with  the  funds  rate, and  announcements  that  areclearly  a policy signal.  The  latter announcements  almost  alwayshave, because  of  the  way they are worded--and people have  studied  thisvery  carefully--some  impact  on policy.  As  I believe you said,Governor Blinder,  it  is hard to  avoid some kind of  impact.  By puttingthe  draft  out  on  the  table,  somebody here might spot  some problem thatmight  escape  the  drafter.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I have  three more people  on  the  list.  ViceChairman McDonough.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I am very strongly persuaded thatwe  should announce policy decisions.  As  I have mentioned before,  ourprevious practice would make  it  possible  in  today's very sophisticatedfinancial  markets, had we continued  that procedure, to  give  an1/31-2/1/95-9-advantage  for  only  10  seconds  or half  a minute  to  the moresophisticated market participants.  We do,  in  fact,  say when there  isno policy action that  the Committee  has  met and there  is  no  furtherannouncement.  That  is  an announcement  of  sorts.  Therefore,  I thinkwhether we  do  that or  whether we  say the  Committee has met  and  therewas  no  change  in policy is--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  is  a big difference.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  It  is  the  symmetric  directiveissue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No.  Somebody has argued--I haveforgotten who  it  was;  it  may have been Don Kohn--that  there  is  animportant difference.  Suppose we purposely delayed an  interest  ratechange  for 48  hours pending  somebody's  speech or  some  statisticalrelease,  and we said  there was  no  change,  and then  48  hours  later wemade a change;  it would  look awkward.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  That  is  right;  I had not heard  thatargument.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  we say  the  Committee has made nomake a change  later.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  The point  I want to  emphasize  isthat we  should continue  to  have  Joe Coyne announce  that  the  Committeemeeting is  over  and that  there  is  no  further announcement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  I think that works.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I think the  content of  what we havehad to  say in our announcements  of  policy changes has  been quite good.Personally,  looking back to  August  16,  I wish that we  had not  saidthat  these  actions are expected to  be  sufficient  at  least  for a timeto meet  the  objective  of  sustained noninflationary growth.  Since Iwas  very supportive of  the  decision,  I understand why we did it.  Ithink, henceforth, we might want  to  be even more  careful  about makingsuch a statement.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr. Chairman,  I would like  to put  another point  onthe  table.  That  is,  the  Committee made  several policy changes  lastspring  that  involved only open market operations  and not discountrates.  In  those  cases,  except  for  that  first  change, you  simplyannounced the  fact  that  the  rate had changed without  a fullexplanation at  that  time.  Explanations  came  later  when  theCommittee's  actions were  taken  in  conjunction with changes  in thediscount rate.  This  is  really a question  for  the Committee.  Does  theCommittee wish  to put  out  discount  rate  type  announcements whendiscount  rates  are not  changed or would it  prefer  to  try to  maintainthis  tiny  distinction between what Governor LaWare used  to  call"ringing the gong" with  the discount  rate  and a less  open policychange  involving only  the  federal  funds  rate?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The  subcommittee's proposal was  the  former.  Astatement with an  interest  rate change  was  the  subcommittee's1/31-2/1/95-10-recommendation.  The  full  Committee  can  reject  it  if  there  is  nodiscount  rate  change.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  So  there  would be no  announcement unless  thediscount  rate  is  changed?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  No.  Either.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Either.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Either or.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  An announcement would accompany an  interestrate  change, whichever kind of  interest  rate  it  was.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  A  statement would say more  than just  "we changedthe  interest  rate" but would give  at  least  some boilerplateexplanation as  to why we changed.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  A very brief  explanation.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  First  of  all,  I agree  on  immediateannouncements,  and  I like  the  way we have  done  it.  That  is,  when wetake  no  action, we  say  there  is  no  announcement.  Regarding thestatement,  I think  it  should give  no reason  or be  extremely brief.  Westarted making announcements  to make  sure  there  is  no  advantage  toanyone.  Our procedure  takes  care  of  a  lot  of  that  and is  one of  thereasons  I am pleased with  it.  Now, if  we  take  it  a step  further--especially when we have  a change  only in  the  fed  funds  rate,  and startexplaining--we open ourselves  up even more  to misinterpretation,  Ithink.  Every word is  taken a different  way, and  that  causes  moreconfusion  than  it  settles.  Except  in very rare  instances, and  thereare  always  instances  one  can  think of,  we  should minimize  anycomments.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I also  am  in agreement  with the  announcementpolicy, but  I would like  to  argue  for  a bit  of  flexibility on whetherwe do  or do  not  announce  "no change."  There  are  instances where nochange  is  not  a change  in policy.  There  are  instances  where thereverse  is  true.  For  example,  if  we decided not  to  do  anything  atthis  meeting, I think  that  would suggest  something different  in  theway we now see  things  than  is  indicated  in  the minutes  of  previousmeetings.  I would think  that  where we have  a situation where nochange  is  in  fact  a change  in policy, something  ought  to be  said, butwe  should not  hold our  feet  to  the  fire  every time  we have a meetingand do not make  a change.  We should keep  our options  open, but  wherethere  is  something  to  be  communicated, we  should communicate  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN.GREENSPAN.  I think  that  is  a good thought.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I would  leave  the  statement wording  to you,Mr.  Chairman, because  I don't  think there  is  any way we  can draft  itas  a Committee.  I would  like  to  hear the  statement  before  it  isreleased, but  I would give  you  the  flexibility.  I also  feel  that1/31-2/1/95-11-President  Broaddus'  suggestion  of  having  a staff  draft  to  work  fromhas  some  interest, but  I would really hope  that  the  statement would bevery short  and crafted  to reflect  the  discussion that  went  on  in  themeeting, which can't  always  be  anticipated before  the meeting.  Iwould go with the  subcommittee on  the  suggestion  that  you draft  thestatement, Mr.  Chairman, and if  you want  to  tell  us  about  it,  fine.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The point at  issue  is  that  if  it  is  morethan boilerplate, Governor  Blinder  is  absolutely right.  There  is  noway to  make any value-neutral  statement  in  the  English  language.There  is  always  some value element  involved.  We have  always  had timeto  have a  statement written  in advance,  and  I would suggest  that  shortof  an extraordinary  situation  or  a surprising situation,  that  reallyought  to be part  of  the  process.  What that  statement says,  leavingthe  particular language  aside,  does  have content  that  affects  thethe  basic  substance.  I can conceive  that  in  an emergency we mighthave  to  bypass  that,  but  I would  say it  would not be wise policy undernormal  circumstances.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Are we  talking about  the  directive  or  theactual  statement  itself?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Just  the  statement.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  We have  not been writing  the  statement  inadvance,  have we?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  When we were  doing  the discountrate  announcements, we always  had  a draft  if  there was  a possibilityof  a change  in  the  rate.  We would have  a  tentative  statement to  beread in  the event  that  the votes  were  there.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Two-handed  intervention!

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I would like  to raise  a minor, orthe  drafter of  the  statement,  but  the  fact  that he  has had it  inpectore rather  than  on  the  table means  that  the  debate  is  notinhibited by people  looking at  the  statement  and seeing what  the partyline may be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  the statement  has  always  beendiscussed after  the vote.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I thought  you were  suggesting  thatyou were  going to  have  it  available  for people  while  they were  voting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  No, we vote and  then decide  what  it  is--

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  What we voted on!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  we have been doing recently is  tovote and  then discuss what  type  of  statement would be  issued  shouldthe  Board approve  a discount  rate  change  that would be part of  thehad voted.1/31-2/1/95-12-

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I understand how it  has  worked.  I,at  least,  got  confused by what  you said just now.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am sorry.  I would  say that  if we  aregoing through a process  involving  an FOMC  vote, and it  is  going to  beeither preceded or  followed by a discount  rate  change,  the  statementthat  is  to be used  in  the  discount rate  announcement  should beindicated to  the  FOMC,  at  least  in  approximate  form, after  the  FOMCvote.  If  there  is  a challenge  as  to whether  or not  the  statementcaptures  the substance  of what  the Committee  decided, we  have a chanceto  change  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Just  a couple  of  comments:  I might  statesomewhat differently than  did the Vice  Chairman  the rationale for whywe  are doing what we are doing.  We are  trying to make the bestpossible monetary policy decisions  and that depends  very crucially onthe  quality  of  the  deliberative process.  At  the  same  time, we alsowant  to  be as  open as  possible.  That  balance of  having a qualitydeliberative process  and a degree  of  openness,  I think, ought  to  bereexamined  from time  to  time.  What was  the  right  balance  in oneperiod may be different  in  another period.  I agree  with the  immediatechange.  I think that  there  are  some  rather strong reasons  for onlyannouncing changes  and not getting  into  the  habit  of  announcing  "nochange"  decisions,  even  though  I can conceive  of  situations where  thatmight be best.  In addition  to  the  examples  you gave,  Mr. Chairman,where  there may be a reason  to  delay the  implementation for  a coupleof days  and it  therefore would be  very awkward to  issue  a no-changestatement,  there is  also  the  complication  that we  sometimes  haveconference  calls between meetings.  In my view we would not want toget  into  the habit  of  stating  that policy was not  changed at  a meetingeven  though we might  have considered  the possibility of  a change at  anunscheduled meeting  during the  intermeeting period.  Anothercomplication is  the  delegation that  the Committee makes  to  theChairman.  The  Chairman has  the  flexibility to  change policy betweenmeetings.  While  it may be  splitting hairs, conceivably  the Chairmancould think  about making a change and decide against  it.  If we  have astated policy that we  are going to  announce both change and no change,it  could get  more  complicated.  It  is  much cleaner  to  do  it  the waythat we have  been doing it.On  the  issuance of  a statement,  I think we  ought  to  have astatement when we  do make  a change.  It  ought  to  be  short.  To me,  themain  reason  is  that  somebody is  going  to explain  our action,  and Iwould rather  our words  be the  basis  for  that  explanation  than  somebodyelse's  interpretation.  So,  I think it  is worth a sentence or  two, butI feel  rather  strongly that  it  has  to be up  to  the  Chairman.  TheChairman can get all  the  advice he wants  from the  Committee, but  it  ishis  responsibility, and I think we ought  to  make  that  clear.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I agree with announcing as  we have done  over  thepast  year, including  the  indication as  appropriate  that  the  meetinghas adjourned and there  is  no  further  announcement.  As  far  as  the1/31-2/1/95-13-substance  is  concerned, though,  I think your characterization, Mr.Chairman,  of  the message  about  the  future  is  the  important criterion.That  depends  critically on  the  regime  that  we are  in.  If  we were  inan  era when people  had absolutely no  doubt  about  the ultimateobjectives  of  the Committee--if  we already had a totally crediblecommitment  to  future price  level  stability, or had announced somethingalong  the lines  suggested  in  the  Dave  Lindsey memo  regarding futureobjectives--and  the  only message was  a matter  of  tactics  in order  toachieve  those  objectives,  that  is  one thing.  In  that  case,  I would bewilling to be more  forthcoming about how our action  is  intended toachieve  the  objectives.  However, the  regime  that we  are  in,  as  Iperceive it,  is  one where  there  is  some uncertainty about  ourobjectives.  The message could get  confused in  the minds  of  the publicas  to what  it  is  we  are  trying to  achieve versus how we  are trying  toachieve it.  In that  case,  I would prefer the  briefest possiblestatement  to minimize that misinterpretation.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I agree  that  it  is  appropriate  to  makeannouncements  of policy changes,  and when there  are no  changes  tocontinue  to  indicate  that meetings have  ended.  With respect  to  thestatements,  I think that,  as  a general  matter, making  them  as  short  aspossible  is  probably the best  rule  of  thumb.  We always  have  to  leaveopen  the  ability to  communicate what needs  to  be  communicated,  and  Ithink that  should be  left  to  the  Chairman's  discretion.  If  he  has  adraft statement  that he  feels  matches  the  gist  of  the  discussion, Ithink  it  would be useful  for  that  to  be  read.  But I would hate to  seethat built  in as  a requirement because  I do  think that the  Chairmanneeds  to  have  some discretion  in terms  of  wording  the  final  statement.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That  is  the  end of  the  list.  I would just  liketo  add my own views.  I would like  to  align myself very  strongly withCathy Minehan's  views  on  the  "no change."  We would not want  to becommitted to  making a statement every time we did nothing.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Many of  those  times we have  nothing to  say.There have  been times  in history when not  changing  the  interest  ratewas  the news  or  changing  the  interest  rate was  the  non-news.  I wouldcertainly like  to  see  us  have  the  flexibility  to  make an  announcementand  explain why we decided not  to  change interest  rates,  where thatseems  sensible.  My personal preference  would be  for a policy  thatcalls  for  a statement  at  every interest  rate  change and  the option ofa statement  on a no-change, but by no means a requirement  of  astatement  on a no-change.  I would also  like  to  go  out  on  a limb--I  amnot hesitant  to  go  out  on  limbs as you know--against what  is  obviouslythe  tide toward briefer  and  terser.  I believe,  for the  reasons  EdBoehne and others mentioned, that we now have  a situation where  thepeople  that  speak the  least  about  the Fed's  decisions are  those  at  theFed, and we  are interpreted voluminously.  There  is  nothing wrong withthat.  We will  still  be  interpreted voluminously even if  we  saythings.  But our  statement  is  a chance  for us  to  say what  we are up  toand why.  I don't have  a specific  number in mind, but  a number  ofcentral  banks around the  world say a lot  more about  their  policy thanwe  do.  We could expand from  our current empirical  norm of  zero  to1/31-2/1/95-14-three  sentences.  Going up from  that  would still  leave us  with afairly short  statement.  I am not  talking  about writing a book.On the  issue  of  the pen  in  the  Chairman's  hand, it  seems  tome  that we have coalesced around  a policy where  the  Chairman has  adraft,  he  reads  it,  he  listens  to  what people  say, and  then  he hasunilateral  authority  to  do with that  as  he  wishes.  It  sounds  likealmost  everybody  is  there  on that  one.  President Moskow wants  tospeak also.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I generally agree  with  the  thrust of  what hasbeen  said.  Let me  just preface  it by saying,  as  a newcomer,  that  Ithink  the announcement policy of  the  past year  has been working quitewell.  Essentially, what we  are doing  is  ratifying  the  currentpractice.  Certainly, we  should continue  announcing  our policy changesafter each meeting.  The  announcements  should be brief.  I  think theChairman's  suggestion  that  they continue  to be  read to  the  Committeefor  any  comments  is  good and useful.  Maybe  this  is  just  a nuance  onthe  Minehan/Blinder suggestion,  but  I would phrase  it  a  littledifferently though  I think  I am in complete  agreement  with what youare  saying.  As  I understand  the  current  practice,  after the  meetingJoe Coyne  announces  that  the  meeting is  over and  that  there  is  noannouncement.  That  is  the announcement;  there  is  essentially noannouncement.  Now it  seems  to  me  that we  as  a Committee  can make  anannouncement  at  any  time  if  we  want  to  without  changing  interestrates.  We  always have  the  option  of  making a statement  if  we want  to.We could  do  it  after  the meeting  if  we  so  desired.  I just  would notput  it  in  the  context  of  a  "we are going  to  announce no-change."  Ithink  I would  say that  if  we have an  announcement to make when thereis  no  change, we will  make an  announcement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  One way to  resolve  this  issue  of whetherto make  an  announcement when  there  is  no change  in policy is  to viewit  as  a policy question  that  should be part  of  our debate.  In  otherwords,  if we  are  in a  situation where part  of  the  response  that weexpect  to  get  stems  from our doing  nothing, that  is  a major policyissue, not  a  disclosure question;  so  that  is  part  of our  discussion.On rare  occasions--I  think probably quite  rare--it might be  that whatwe  want  to  do  is  to put  aside  our standard procedure, which we alwayshave  the option of  doing  anyway, and as  part of  a policy decision wecould say  that policy has not  changed and make a  statement.  Or wecould just  say  that  we did not  change  our policy and make nostatement.  Both  of  those  are policy-oriented matters.  I gather  thethrust or  consensus  here  is  that  we  should  leave  our announcementpolicy as  it  is.  That  is,  if  policy is  not  changed,  Joe Coyne willsay that  we have  ceased functioning, which may have more  implicationsthan--[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  He won't  say  that!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There would be no announcement unlessthere  is  something positive  to  be  gained as  a result  of making  one,  inwhich case  that would be part  of  what we would discuss and we wouldinstruct Joe  accordingly.  I would  guess  that  that may happen  once  ayear,  maybe less.  I do  think that  leaving  the  issue open  in  theabstract  and maybe as  a practical  matter does  have  some merit.1/31-2/1/95-15-

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  That  is  exactly what  I had in mind, Mr.Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think we may have reached a consensus.  Itsounds  like one.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't you try  to  define  it?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I have been  assigned to  define the  consensus.The consensus  is  that  on  interest  rate  changes,  be  they  federal  fundsrate  changes  only or discount  rate  changes  only or  both, there  willnormally be  a statement.  I think there  was  a strong consensus  thatthose  statements should be terse.  A draft  of  them should normally beread to  the Committee  by the  Chairman who will  ask  for comments  andthen will  have the  authority  to  do with  those  comments  as  he wishes.In cases  of  no change  in policy,  there  is  an  option of  making  astatement,  if we  see  something  to  be gained.  But  there  is  nopresumption that  there will be a statement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Tom.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  If  I may, it  seems  to  me  that  the  last  part ofthat  should be  stated the  other way.  There  is  a presumption  that  ifthere  is  no policy  change,  the meeting would end with no  announcement.An exception would be  made  if  there  is  a policy consideration  to beserved, which we  would discuss  at the  meeting.  Is  that what  I heard?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes,  I think so.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That  is  what  it  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  An  announcement when there  is  nopolicy change  is  an  exception  and must be  agreed to  during thediscussion in the  FOMC meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any objection  to  that  summary, which  Ithought was  scholarly?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  A much higher grade  than  I would have given  it.Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am emotionally involved with CRA![Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The  second issue  relates  to  the  tapes andtranscripts.  The  subcommittee  is  basically recommending the  statusquo  except  for the  issue of  an  occasional  off-the-tape discussion thatis not  about  monetary policy.  It  may be,  for  example,  about  someconfidential  personnel matter.  Other people may have  other examples,but monetary policy would not  be  included.  I guess  the  floor  is  open.Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Unfortunately I am going to be  dissenting onthis.  I realize  I am  in  the minority.  The  discussion in  your memosays  there  is  a strong consensus  that we  would all  be  better off  ifthe practice  of  taping FOMC meetings  had never begun.  That  is  true.1/31-2/1/95-16-It  is  also  true  that  this  Committee  never authorized the maintenanceof  tapes.  As  the memo  points  out  later  on,  most  of  us  were  taken bysurprise when we  found out  that  the  transcripts were maintained.  So.I think that  there  is  an  issue  of  justice  here  and that we  areratifying an  injustice by approving  the  recommendation, practicalthough  it  may be.The  second concern  I have  is  a hypothetical  one.  At  themoment we  live  in a very benign political  environment  in which  thechances  that  the  tapes will  be  used against  the  Committee  are veryslim.  That  is  not necessarily  the  environment we  should presume inconsidering whether or  not  it  is  wise  to  tape  these  proceedings.  Infact,  an abundance  of  caution would suggest  that we  should imagine avery non-benign situation.  One might  think of  it  as  a witch hunt  inwhich we  are  turning over  to  the  prosecutors evidence  that  is  reallynone  of  their business.  It  is possible  for  us  to prevent  taping underthose  circumstances by turning off  the tape now.  It will  not bepossible in  that  less  benign political  environment  for us  to  turn  offthe  tape when we  feel  we need to.  So,  I think we  should show at  leasta little  caution about  the  vagaries of  the  political process  andprotect  not  ourselves but some  future Committee  that may be  in a morehostile political  time  than  that  in which we  find ourselves  and  I'dturn  off  the  tape now while we can do  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  A couple  of  comments:  First,  on this  issue ofturning the  tape  off  for certain periods  of  time,  I have had  a concernthat  in doing that,  even  though  it might be desirable  in  somerespects,  we  could incur  a fairly heavy political  cost with respect  tohow the  Federal  Reserve  is  perceived.  Apparently, the publicperception is  that  the  Fed is  not  as  forthcoming  as  it  ought  to be,and  turning  off the  tape  for parts  of  our meetings would be perceivedas  a step  in  the direction  of becoming more  secretive.  So,  as  Imentioned in  the  letter  that  I sent  to  Alan Blinder earlier, while  itmight be desirable  in  some  sense,  I think if  I were going  to  incurthat cost,  I would be  inclined to  shut  the  tape  off entirely.Second, in  thinking about  these  issues,  I come at  it  the  sameway  that Ed Boehne  described before.  We really have  to  think in  termsof  this  tradeoff between  the  deliberative process  and providingdisclosure to  the public.  Our primary responsibility ought  to  be  tomake  sure  that we  have  an  effective  deliberative process  and thenprovide  as much information  to  the  public  as  possible.  In  thinkingabout  the issue  of  continuing to  run  the  tapes,  I feel  much the  sameway as  Governor  Lindsey has  stated here.  In my view it  is  just  amatter  of  time,  given  the various  avenues  through which we  could beserved a Congressional  subpoena, that  those  tapes will be  listened toon virtually a real  time basis  and could be  used as  a means ofisolating members  and basically killing the deliberative  process.  Theonly way to preserve  that process at  that point in  time would be  tosay, now that  the damage  is  apparent, we  are going to  turn  the  tapeoff.  But  that would be in  the  very sort  of  climate  that  that  actionwould be considered as  a major affront.  Frankly, I have seen us backaway  from much  less  threatening situations  because  of  the  concernabout  the potential  for  legislation.  In  this particular issue withrespect  to  the  tapes,  we have had a couple of  opportunities  along theway,  in my opinion anyway, where we  might have  had an  opening to1/31-2/1/95-17-correct this.  The  first  instance  occurred when  the  Justice Departmentannounced its  new policies with respect  to  defending  agencies on FOIArequests.  We may have  had another opportunity more  recently thisfall.  In  any event,  I think  that we could be  leaving a future FOMC  ina very difficult position.  In  effect,  in  approving what  isrecommended here, we have  to  be  saying to  ourselves,  I am approvingthis  recognizing that  an  important condition would be  that,  in  theevent of  that  sort  of  request, we would be prepared to  take  the  actionand turn  the  tape off  to  try  to  preserve the  deliberative process  andfight whatever battle needs  to  be  fought  at  that  time.  But  again,that  is  going to be  one  difficult battle.  The real  question iswhether  there will  be  a better  opportunity in  some other  environmentto  straighten out  our  record-keeping practices.  I think all  of  thisis better  stated in  my  letter  that you all  have  than  I have  juststated it.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  As  a point  of  clarification, what did thesubcommittee conclude with regard  to  this point?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  When  the  subcommittee met  and drafted  itsreport, we viewed  the  subpoena  option as  considerably less  likely  thanwe  did subsequently--after Virgil's  memo pointed to  the  route  throughthe Government  Operations Committee.  But a subpoena was  already apossibility.  I believe  our view was  that  we  should  resist a subpoenaif  and when  it  came.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  There  is  a reference  to  that  in  our report  atthe bottom  of  page 2 and the  top  of  page  3.  It  is  an  explicitstatement  of  the  conditions under which we would approve  turning  offthe  tape.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Where?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  It  is  the very last  sentence on page  2 carryingover to  page  3 in  the  subcommittee's  report.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I must  say that  when it  was  revealed that wewere  taping  these  sessions,  I wished that we  had never  started  thispractice.  But having thought about  this  over  the past year  or  so,  Ihave  begun  to  think  that  having  the  tape may not really be all  thatbad.  It  does provide  evidence  of  the  accountability of  the FederalReserve.  I don't  think  that  it  has  in  any way interfered with  thedeliberative  process.  I did  sense at  the  very beginning that  someinterference might have  happened, but  I now feel  that  the  deliberativeprocess has  been preserved.  We  agreed  to  a five-year period beforerelease  of  the  transcripts,  and  I think  that  in itself  helps  tosafeguard the  deliberative process.  I see  the  danger of  a subpoena asfairly minimal.  I don't  believe  it  is  going to  happen,  although itcould, and if  it  does  I think we have ways  of  resisting it.  In  theinterests  of  accountability and openness  about what  happens  in  thecentral  bank, keeping  the  tape  on  is  the way to  go,  even  leaving asidethe political  difficulty of  turning  it  off  at  this point.  It  is  agood  idea  to  have  the  tape on  as  a matter  of  principle.Having  said that,  I would agree  that  a very good argument  canbe made  for  turning the  tape off  on  those occasions  when we have  todiscuss very sensitive personnel  matters  or  perhaps matters  dealingwith  other central banks--the situation we  are  in  at  the moment--or1/31-2/1/95-18-issues  involving  foreign  governments.  I think we  can draw an analogyfrom  the  Freedom of  Information Act.  It  is  a statute  that calls  foraccountability  and openness in  government, but  there  are exceptionsand exemptions  that are  brought  to  bear.  Those include personnelmatters, deliberations pertaining to  foreign  central banks,  and so  on.Such  exemptions can give  us  the  justification for  turning  off  thetape.  I believe  the way our policy should be  stated is  that  the  tapeis  on  as  a general  rule but  that  it  is  turned  off  in  those  exceptionalcases.  To  conclude,  we would be  in a very difficult  position  if  wewere  to  turn  the  tape  off  completely,  and as  I said, I don't  think itis  costing us  very much to  keep  it  going anyway.

MR. BLINDER.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I would  like  to  align myself  with most  of  whatPresident  Forrestal  had to  say.  I do  see  the need for  such a recordfor  reasons  of  accountability, but  I have a question.  We have  tapesand we have  lightly edited transcripts.  Do  we have  to keep both ofthese?  Are both  the  full record, or  do  we get rid of  the  tapes  uponthe  development  of  the  lightly edited  transcripts?  Would a potentialsubpoena, assuming it  did not  cover  a recently completed meeting forwhich we  have  a tape  but not  yet  a lightly edited  transcript,  coveronly  the  lightly edited  transcript?  Or  do we  have to  keep the  tapes,too?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  No.  Once  the edited transcript  is  approvedby  the participants,  the  tape can be  dispensed with.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  And so  can  the  draft,  lightly  edited,  that  is  sentto  the members  for  review.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  The  approved record would be  the  editedtranscripts.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  So  the  lightly edited  transcript  is what we aretalking about  in terms  of  what might be  subpoenaed.  In thisconnection  I would like  to  note  that  there has been  some  delay interms  of  our getting  the  word-for-word transcript.  I have not  seenone  in a little while;  maybe  I am  just behind  in my work.  To theextent  that  that  is  pretty much up  to  speed--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  transcript  for  the  December 20meeting came  out  several  days  ago.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  The  lightly edited version?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  That  transcript was  sent  out  about  the  12th  of

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Really?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  draft version  for  you to  correct.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I saw the  minutes  for  the  December meeting.  Ihave not  seen  that  transcript.  I don't  know why.1/31-2/1/95-19-

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  One point  of  clarification, President Minehan:For  earlier meetings  before the  Committee  started  to  review thetranscripts--that  is,  those before  January of  last  year--we  are notpermitted to  throw away the  raw  transcripts.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  But  for all  the  transcripts  that  the participantsin  the meeting  have  reviewed and made  corrections  to  their  statementswhere necessary, we  can throw away both the  tapes  and  the drafttranscripts.  That would  cover everything  from  the  start  of  1994  on.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So,  have  you  thrown  away the  tapes  but  stillhave the  draft  transcripts,  or have you  kept both?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  So  far, pending  this  discussion, we  have kepteverything.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Going  forward then,  we would--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Going  forward,  once the  lightly edited  transcriptis  finished, we would throw away the  other  transcript  and  the  tape.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So within the  ambit  of  the next  meeting, youwould have  a  lightly edited  transcript  and no  draft  transcript  ortape?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I don't know what  the  timeframe will  be.  It mighttake  a couple  of months  before we  get all  the  corrections and are  ableto  incorporate them  into  the  lightly edited  transcript.  By the  timewe  send the  draft  transcripts to  you, you send  them directly back  tous,  and we  incorporate corrections,  there may be a meeting that  goesby.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Okay.  I think  it  is  important  that  most ofwhat anybody would get  with a subpoena would be the  transcripts thatwe have  reviewed for  accuracy--the  lightly edited  transcripts with  theconfidential  information redacted.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Then I think that  normally  keeping  the  tape  onis  the right  way to  go.  The  tape  is  normally  on,  and  it  is  explicitlyturned  off  only  for certain  discussions  of  confidential matters  otherthan monetary policy.  I am  convinced that we have  less  risk with  thispolicy, given what  Don has said  about  the  lightly edited  transcript.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The Chairman has  just  requested  that we  speedup  this  conversation.  With  that,  I call  on  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I basically agree with what  President  Forrestalsaid.  I would stress,  though,  that  if  we do have  the  tapes  subpoenaedwe  fully intend to  stop  taping at  that  point.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  If  we  did  not already have  thetapes,  I am not  sure  that  I would  support  initiating  such a procedure,1/31-2/1/95-20-but I don't see  the possibility of  terminating  it  at  this  time.  Wehave  transcripts  for  1994.  They will  be  released five years  from now,or  sooner if  somebody makes  us.  That  leaves  us  basically with twochoices  if  we were even  to  contemplate  turning  the  recorder off.Either we  announce  now that we are  stopping, take  the  storm now, orwait until  the year  2000  and then  say that we  turned  the  recorder offfive years ago.  Neither  alternative is  realistic.  That  to  me  is  justnot  something  we can consider.  I would oppose  turning  the  tape  offeven  for  non-monetary-policy parts  of  our meetings.  The principlethat we have  established of  taping entire meetings,  as we have  done inthe past  year, is  really  the  one we have  to  support.  One of  thedefenses  we have against  earlier  release, whether we end up with  fouryears or  three years  or  one year  or whatever,  is  that we  do  discusssensitive matters.  We do  discuss  foreign governments  and foreigncentral  banks  and  individuals.  And leaving  that  sort  of  informationon  the  tape  is  the  reason  that we can give  as  to  why we have  to have afive-year  delay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  a very good point.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I would say  the  current  situation  is  such thatas  much  as  I would  like  to  turn  the  tape  off,  I don't  think we can.Having said  that,  I must  tell  you  that  I think Governor Lindsey isright.  First  of  all,  I believe  the  tape has  had some  chilling effecton  our discussions.  I see  a lot more people  reading  their  statements.I think it  is  harder  to  be  as  candid as  some of  us  might otherwise be.But more  importantly,  I think if  we do  start  seeing  the  threat of  asubpoena  or  inquiries,  that will  have  a clear  chilling effect,  and itcould happen  at  the most  critical  of  times  for monetary policymaking.We are  in a sense  confined to  this  outcome  of  leaving  the  tape  on  fornow.  I hate  to  see  this  enunciated as  a formal  policy.  I would liketo  see  our options preserved for  the  time when we  can seize  theopportunity  to  turn the  tape off.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I must  say  that  I have never seen  any reason whywe  should not keep  the  tape  on.  I agree with some  of  therepresentations  made here  that  might  serve  us well  in protecting thetape.  The  lightly edited  transcript,  I think,  is  very useful  from ahistoric point of  view.  If  we can  delete or  remove  or edit  theconfidential material,  I don't  see  the problem.  What  puzzles  me hereis  why we  feel  it  necessary to  enunciate  this policy change.  Why dowe have  to  tell anybody what we  are doing?  Do we  have  to  make  itpublic?  This  does  not  involve any change  in monetary policy.  I wasbaffled when I came across  the  issue  of  how we should  enunciate thison  our agenda.  Is  somebody out  there waiting  for  us  to  enunciate  apolicy?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Let  them wait  then.  [Laughter]  They willforget about  it  after a while.  I just  don't  see the  need to  do  that.It will  just  reopen the  whole issue  and stoke  the  fire under  it.1/31-2/1/95-21-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let  me respond to  that because  it  is  aquite  legitimate question.  It  is my impression  that House BankingCommittee  Chairman Leach has  been holding off  on  any  legislativeinitiatives  in  this  area on  the  grounds  that we  are  going to  do  itourselves.  The  impression I have--I don't know how firmly based itis--is  that  if  we don't  set  our own policy,  there will be  realinterest  in  that  committee  in trying  to  do  something.  Whether  or notthe  issue would go  to  the  full  House  is  a question, but  my suspicionis  that  there  is  more  support for  FOMC  openness,  on both sides  of  theaisle,  than I think we  have realized up  to  now.  Larry Lindsey isobviously correct.  The degree  of Congressional  friendliness  is  muchmore  evident when, say, Jim Leach is  in the  chair  instead of HenryGonzalez.  But  I don't think  that  their views  on the  issue  of  theopenness  of  the  Fed, on disclosure and that sort  of  thing, aresignificantly different.  Let me  just  ask Don Winn  to make  sure  that Iam not misreading.  Do  you have an  impression, Don, as  to  the  answerto  that?

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  I agree with your impression, Mr. Chairman.  Myunderstanding  from talking with the  committee  staff  is  that  there wasinterest on  the part  of  the new chairman of  the  committee  on  includingsomething on  this  subject  in  legislation.  Indeed,  the bill  that wasintroduced on  the  first  day  of  the  session  concerning the  Reserve  Bankpresidents  probably would have  included a provision dealing withtranscript-type  issues--maintenance  of  the  transcript, release of  thetranscript,  and the  time period  for  the  release.  Such  a provision wasleft  out because  there was  an understanding  on  their part  that wewould be addressing this  issue.  So,  the  interest in  the  transcriptssubject cannot  be  thought  of  as  simply a matter  that the  other  side  ofthe  aisle was  focused on  and interested  in.  It  is  a subject  thatcontinues  to  be  of  interest  in  the  Congress.  It  is  also  a subject inwhich  the new chairman of  the  committee  through his staff  hasexpressed an  interest to  us.  The  expectation  on  their part  is  that wewould make some  kind of policy decision.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Chairman Leach effectively is  leaving  itto  us  to  make  the  judgment,  but he has made  it  very clear  that  hewants  us  to make a judgment.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Are you finished, Mr.  Chairman?  Did you wantto  say more?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't want  to  say more.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I am  very concerned  about making  a long-termCommittees  for many years  to  come.  Since I am very new to  this,  I ambegging indulgence  if  I ask  some very basic questions.  First  of  all,you mentioned that  Virgil Mattingly's  memo came  out  after  thesubcommittee had written its  report.  Did the  subcommittee  considerthat  legal  memo in  later deliberations  and still  agree  to  go  forwardwith its  recommendation?1/31-2/1/95-22-

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes.  Subsequent to  that memo we had aconference call  devoted-almost  exclusively to  the memo  and we  left  therecommendation intact.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I divide  this  into  two  questions.  One  is,  wouldwe want  to  have  these  tapes  today if  we were voting today  to  set up asystem of  taping and follow the procedure we are going  to  have?  Wouldwe do  that  today?  My sense just  from  reading this  report  and from thecomments  here  is  that we  would not  initiate  this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You could stipulate  that.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Okay.  If  that  is  the  case,  then  the  secondquestion I have  is  whether we have  explored both within  the Committeeand with those  in  the  Congress who are  so  interested  in  this  areaother ways  that we  could be more  open.  I agree  that we  should have  apolicy of  openness  unless  it  is  going to  interfere with  ourdeliberative process.  Have we explored other options?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  address  that.  I think the answerto  that  is  definitely yes.  We have  explored it  on  the  Hill  and triedto  get a sense  of  where everyone was.  We obviously can't  do  this  inany detail,  but  I am not  sure  that  any of  the  options we  tried tosurface had any support.  The  only real  option  that exists  for us  nowis  to  turn  off  the  tapes.  That  is  an  option  for which I believe  therewas  some  strong support within  this  Committee  a year or  so ago, mainlyon  the  grounds  that we  thought  the  taping  inhibited the  deliberativeprocess,  not  that we were  concerned about  the subpoena  issue, which isa somewhat  different  question.  I think  the  conclusion, with perhaps  aqualification  from  Tom Hoenig,  is  that  there  is  very little evidencethat  the  quality of  our discussions  has  been reduced.  Indeed,  some  ofour most  fervent  discussions  have occurred in  the period since  we allknew  the  tape was  on.  On  that  issue,  I think the  question has prettymuch become moot.  What  is  an  issue,  and I think  it  is  a real  one, isthe  subpoena question.  It  is  an  issue  that  could freeze  ourdiscussions  at  some point.  If  we really wanted to get  paranoid onthis whole thing, we basically could  say that,  if we had notranscripts, we would all  get  subpoenaed to  testify in  some  openforum.  My own  judgment is  that  the chance  of getting subpoenaedclearly is  very negligible  in  the  short  run, certainly  the  next  twoyears.  If  we get  into an  environment  in which  the  subpoena  issuebecomes  a big question, my guess  is  that  it  will  not be  our mostimportant problem.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Mike, were you finished?

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I want  to  support  Jerry Jordan's point--if weare going  to  leave  the tape  on most  of  the  time,  I think he made acompelling argument  for leaving  it  on  all  of  the  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Then  the  lightly edited transcript wouldbe released after five years  in redacted form.  We have redactioncapabilities.  So,  it  is  really a redaction  issue.1/31-2/1/95-23-

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Yes,  it  would not preclude  that.  I think wewould  still have  the  lightly  edited transcript as  the principalwritten record, but  I also  think that  there might be something  to  begained by keeping  the  draft  transcripts  somewhere  in  our archives  sothat  any questions  that might come  up  about  the  integrity of  theediting process  could be answered.  I do not  think we would loseanything by that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Isn't  there a legal  question on  theredacting?  That  is,  within  30  years don't we have  to  send  theunredacted transcript  to  the National  Archives?  We  can't  redact  thetranscript and  throw  the unredacted version  away.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I am confused.  Could you clarify?  I thoughtwe had to  keep an unredacted transcript  for  archival purposes, but  Ialso  thought I heard you say before  that we do  not have  to  do  that  andthat  we  can  just destroy that  transcript  once we have done  theredactions.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  What we would destroy  is  the  draft transcript  thatdoes not  incorporate your  edits.  We would then  have a completelightly edited transcript--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Including the  materials  that  would laterbe  redacted before publication.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes,  before release  to  the public.  The unredactedtranscript would be  turned over  to  the National Archives  after 30years.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Okay.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I have  a point of  information  that  I think  getsto  the heart  of  President  Boehne's  comment and  our willingness  toredact  certain materials.  Mr. Chairman, is  it  your intention  to  turnoff  the  tape during  the  discussion of  Mexico we are  about  to havelater  this  afternoon?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  one  of  the  questions  that  I wasgoing to  raise with  the  Committee after  we discussed the  grounds  forredacting central  bank  issues.  However,  I must  say my own inclinationwould be  to  forget  this  issue  of  turning off  the  tape  from  time  totime  on a discretionary basis  because that  leaves  open  the  question ofhow to  do  that.  It  may be  more of  a problem than  it  is  worth.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  No  quarrel  from me;  I think  it makes  the pointthat we were making earlier.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  On  the  last point  that you made, Mr. Chairman,about when  to  turn  off  the  tape,  there  is  a way to accomplish  that  andthat  is by doing  it  in  a negative way instead of  in  an affirmativeway.  In  other words,  what is  at  issue here,  I believe,  is  anappropriate record, whatever  that may be,  of  monetary policydiscussions.  I would argue  that  it  would be unfortunate  if  thisCommittee  left  itself  in  a position where it  was  unable to  talk freelyabout whatever  it  might want  to  talk about  other  than monetary policy.I do  not know what  those  issues  may turn out  to be, but  I certainlywould like  to have  available to  us  the  opportunity to  discuss  off  the1/31-2/1/95-24-tape  anything that we  might want  to  discuss.  Our monetary policydiscussions, properly defined, do  have  to  be  appropriately recordedfor posterity.  Beyond that,  if  we want  to  go  the  route  of maintainingthe  ability to  discuss whatever--Mexico, personnel matters,  you nameit--off  the  tape,  all  we have  to do  is  to  adopt  a policy  that  says  wewill  tape monetary policy discussions, period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I forgot  this  issue.  Some  of  the  thingsthat  I had in mind for  turning  off  the  tape  were  organizationaldiscussions  and issues relating to how we  as  a Committee comportourselves.  The  reason  I would raise  that  issue,  and I retract what  Ijust  said about  leaving the  tape  on  all  the  time,  goes  back to what  Ithought  was  a frankly  outrageous request  for  the  tape  of  ourdiscussion  in October a year  ago.  It  covered  a discussion of  how wewould comport  ourselves  at  a House  Banking Committee hearing.  That  isthe  sort  of discussion  that we should  leave  ourselves  flexibility tohave with the  tape  off.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Precisely.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would not  turn the  tape off  on  centralbank discussions  on  the  grounds  that  they may involve  importantissues.  But  I would  think that personnel  matters  and discussionsabout  how we  relate  to  the world at  large and how we  organizeourselves  as  a Committee  could be done without  the  tape running.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  For example,  this  conversation we are having  nowwould not be  taped?

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Exactly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  conversation, yes.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I take it your point  is,  of  course,  that what  istaped  ought to be broadened to  include perhaps  central bankconsiderations  as  opposed  to somewhat  more  tightly defined monetarypolicy considerations?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Let me  tell you what  I think I heard as  aconsensus,  though  I am not  sure.  Correct me  if  you  think  I am wrong.It  seems  to  me  that we need a vote  to determine  this.  I think  I hearda consensus,  though not  unanimity, that  we  should continue taping andthat we should  enunciate a policy on  this  issue.  It  is possible notto  say anything.  Is  that  correct?  I think so.  I am leaving asidethe  issue  of  when the  tape  should be  off where  I did not  hear  anyconsensus--maybe  someone else  heard a consensus.  Maybe we  should justhave a vote on  whether there  should be an  "off the  tape"  portion.  Doyou agree?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree.  It  is  not  clear where  theCommittee  is  on  that.  I think we  ought  to  take  a vote  of  all  19  of  usbecause  this  is  a policy in which we will all  be involved, not  justthe  current members  of  the FOMC.1/31-2/1/95-25-

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I have  some  questions.  First,  what  is  thedefinition of  "enunciate?"  Could enunciate be  a private communicationto  the  chairman of  the  House Banking Committee?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Do you want  to  answer  that,  Mr.  Chairman?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Is  it  the  same  thing  as  an  announcement to  thepublic  or  could  it be  different?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I used the phrase  enunciate  a policy and  thequestion  is  does  that  mean--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  When the  tape would be turned off,  isthat what  you mean?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  No,  the  question is  do we  enunciate  a policy ontaping,  and  I do  not really know what  enunciate means  in  this  context.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  You  mean make public  do you not?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Oh, yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That  is  what  I meant.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Make  a public  announcement.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  answer  is  "yes."  We would make  apublic  announcement  and mention  our  decision in  the minutes.  But  theannouncement would not go  into  details.  It  would  just  list  thevarious  items;  it  would be  a very short  statement.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  You  could not just  have  it  in  the minutes  andthen convey that  to  the  chairman of  the House  Banking Committee?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  it  is  in  the minutes,  it  is  public.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The minutes  will  be published in about  six

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Oh,  you mean  those minutes?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think we have  a  few more people  who want  toweeks.speak.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I just  have a question and  this  has  to  do withwhether we  allow the  tapes  to  go  off  for  certain  subjects.  It  is  aquestion to  Virgil:  What  could we argue reasonably convincingly aboutredaction?  For example,  if  we  keep the  tape  on  all  the  time,  what  isit  that  we  could hold back  for  30  years?  What would be a legitimatekind of  argument?  Would the  example  the  Chairman uses  about how wecomport  ourselves  with the  rest  of  the world be  a legitimateredaction?1/31-2/1/95-26-

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  That  is  legitimate.  We could keep  from thepublic  information  that we get  from another central bank or  foreigngovernment on  the  grounds  that  if  we disclosed it  after  five years,  wewould no longer be able  to  get  that  information.  That  source  ofinformation would dry up  and  that  is  legitimate grounds  to redact  thematerial.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  What about  how we  organize ourselves  for  therest  of  the world?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  We would have  to make  that  discussion public.Our  organization rules  are  public.  Now, if  the Committee  is  talkingabout  the appointment  of  a person to  a particular position,  the  debateabout  that  could be  redacted.  There would be a possible  invasion ofpersonal privacy.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  I would note with respect  to  dealings with  foreigncentral banks  that  Congress, back in  the  late  1970s  and the  early1980s  when  they were  considering  legislation dealing with themaintenance of  transcripts, did contemplate  an  exemption dealing withforeign central  banks  that  would have allowed us  to withhold thatinformation  for  30  years.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Returning  to  your  example,  Mr. Chairman,  I wouldagree  that  it  was  outrageous  to  request  the  tape  for  that  telephonemeeting we had in October  1993.  In hindsight, however,  it  probablyserved us  well  that we had that  tape because  it  was very useful  inshowing that  there was  no  conspiracy,  that  there was  no  evil  activitygoing on.  I think it  cleared the  air rather nicely  even though wethought that  it  really was not  a legitimate request.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  it  did clear  the  air, but  theissue is  that  if  we had known our  discussion was  going to betranscribed and made public,  would we have been  inhibited in  thatdiscussion--as  indeed I think we were  in other discussions  later.There  is  a very special  type  of discussion  that any  committee,independently of  the  individuals who happen  to be members  of  it,should be  able to  hold in private.  That is  the  committee's  internalorganization.  An example  is  the  content  of  that particular meeting--who  would say what  to  whom, and how we would decide who  followed whom,and who  would be responsible  for  indicating such  and such.  As  itturned out,  as  soon  as  we brought  all  those  Congressional  committeestaff members  here  to  listen to  the  tape,  the  issue  was  gone.  No  oneuttered a new word.  But  the  fact  that  the  tape  for  that discussionwas  available to  be scrutinized  is  what  I found inappropriate.  Wewill  be accused of  all  sorts  of  conspiracies whether we have  tapes,whether we do not  have  tapes,  or  whether we publish them at  any timebecause  there  is  always the  question:  what  are we not  telling them?It  is  an  unanswerable question.  Maybe  I was  overly sensitive  to  thatparticular episode,  but  I thought  that  it  was  a real  violation of  theCommittee's  rights.  For example,  there  are certain  types  ofconversations we  can't have with each other about how we  are  going toorganize  if  we  are subject  to  making  those publicly available.  Therecan't  be  any informal  discussions.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That's  exactly right.1/31-2/1/95-27-

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  Mr. Chairman, when we are  dealing with monetarypolicy,  it  is  a lot  easier  to  defend preserving the  confidentiality ofa document.  I think there  really is  a lot  of  respect  for  theindependence of  the  Fed in  the  Congress.  When anyone  is  trying to  getinformation and we  can say  it  relates  to  monetary policy, we are  goingto be  more successful  in defending documents  of  that nature.  Where  itis  not monetary policy--and that was  the kind of  tape we were  dealingwith--it  is very hard to  raise our best  arguments  in protecting  ourinformation.  I guess  that  argues  for  limiting what is  taped  tomonetary-policy  types  of  information.  It  is  hard to  defend non-monetary-policy  types  of  information  from a Congressional  request  ordemand.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Tom, did you want  say something  again?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Not  on  substance.  I was  just going  to suggestthat  it might  be helpful  for  the  Chairman  to  take a straw vote--a  showof hands--on  that  issue  first,  just  to  get  a sense  of  where people arewithout  a  formal  vote.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am not going  to  record these  votesbecause we  do not have  to.  There  is  no  legal  requirement.  But we  dohave  to  find  out  where everyone  stands.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Before we  do  that, may  I ask  a question?  Alot  of  times  we  have  briefings  where  one  of  us  or  a member  of  thestaff presents  information  and we  ask questions.  Is  this  the kind  ofthing  that you would contemplate  not  taping?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  the  tape  would be  on  for  that.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I was  thinking  about  legislative matters  suchas  what  is  happening  on  the  Hill,  those  kinds of  discussions?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That  is  not  done during  the meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It  is  done when  the meeting  is  over.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We usually do  that  at  lunch because  itis  not part  of  the  FOMC deliberations.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  And the  tape  is  not  on.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Okay.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I think, Mr.  Chairman, we coulddistinguish between organizational  matters  that would not be  taped  andmonetary and central banking matters  that  would be  taped.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I would have  suggested  something like"confidential matters  not pertaining  to monetary policy" as  the  rubricfor  not taping.  That  is  just  a  suggestion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You  know what  the problem with  that is?It  is  the word  "confidential."1/31-2/1/95-28-

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Strike  "confidential."  Just  say  "matters."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  "Confidential" is  precisely what we  donot want.  It  has  to be based on  the  nature  or  the  substance  of  thediscussion.  I thought  that  the  Vice Chairman's  formulation seemedreasonable.  What  I want  to  do  is  ask for  that  and  also  ask whether ornot  it  should be  the  choice of  the  chair to  make  the decision on whenthe tape  goes  off.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Could you repeat what  Bill  McDonough just  said?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Bill, why don't you repeat  it.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I suggested that organizationalmatters, which we discussed as  examples,  would not be  taped.  Othermatters would be taped and those would be monetary policy  and centralbanking matters.  I do not  know of  anything else  we  talk about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  give you a case  in point--today'smeeting.  We would not have  taped the very beginning of  the meetingwhere we discussed  the Committee's  organization.  We would publish,obviously, the  list  of  everyone who got  elected;  that  is  part  of  thenormal  record.  I suspect we would not  be  taping this particulardiscussion.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This  is  an organizational discussion.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  What  about Mexico?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mexico I think we  tape because  that  is  acentral  bank matter.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  And redact?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  This  is  one  of  the reasons  that  I have asomewhat negative reaction to  the phrase  "central bank matters."  Itis  not obvious  that  what we just  discussed is  not  a  "central bankmatter."

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  You could leave  it  as monetarypolicy because to  me, monetary policy is  a very broad, broad church.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  It  certainly would include  adiscussion of  anything we may do vis-a-vis Mexico.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think most people would say this  is not  aboutmonetary policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can we  just  say  that organizationalissues will not be  taped, all  others will  be?1/31-2/1/95-29-

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That  is  the  formulation  I would  favor  forkeeping the  tape  on.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can we  add that?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay,  the proposal  is  that allorganizational  matters will not  be  taped but,  as  relevant,  thesubstance will  be  included  in the  minutes.  All  other  issues will betaped.  A  lightly edited transcript will be  made  available, redactedas may be  necessary.  The unredacted versions go  to  the  NationalArchives  after  30  years.  Okay?  All  those  in  favor of  that particularproposition, please  raise your hand.  All  those  opposed.  The  "Ayes"have  it.  Shall we do  the next  item?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes,  since  this  one was  so  easy,  let's  go  tothe  novel  aspect  of  the  subcommittee proposal,  which is  to allowindividual  members at  their  option  to  add concurring statements  to  theminutes.  I would like  to  say in  starting  this  off  that  there was  aMullins  subcommittee before  this  subcommittee,  as  a  lot  of  you willremember.  I inherited this  proposal  from the Mullins  subcommittee andheartily endorse  it,  although  it  wasn't  my idea  by any means.  Iwanted to  mention  that.  The  floor  is  now open.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I think there  is  a lot  to  be  said  forconcurring  statements and, Alan, you  articulated  the  arguments verywell.  I would just  like  to  throw  in  one  reservation.  If  we  have  thepossibility of  concurring statements,  we are  going  to  invite more  thanwe might  like.  If  we  start  with  one  concurring  or  two  concurringstatements, we  are  going  to have  five  or  six  in  the next  set  ofminutes.  If  that were  to  happen,  the  quality  of  the minutes woulddiminish because  the  concurring statements would detract  from  theessential  elements of  the  minutes.  Over  the years,  and maybe Virgilcould  confirm this,  I have read many  Supreme Court  and Court  ofAppeals  decisions  that  have  concurring statements.  My judgment hasalways  been that  if  there  are more  than a few concurring  statements,it  really takes  away from  the  essence  of  the decision  of  the  court.That  is  what  I have  in mind when I raise  this  possibility.  I thinkthis  will be  an  invitation  for people  to  get  their names  in  therecord.  I'm  saying  that  as  delicately as  I can.  [Laughter]  Perhapsthis  discussion today is  an  example  of  that--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Bob, you were not  very successful!

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  There  are  advantages, but  I think we need totake  that potential drawback  into  account.  If  we do  agree  that we  aregoing  to  allow concurring statements,  I would urge  the members  of  theCommittee  to be  very judicious  in  the use  of  those  statements.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  ask a question relevant  to  thatbecause  I think Bob Forrestal  is  raising  a very  crucial  question.  Didthe  subcommittee  consider  any sort  of  halfway alternative where  therewould be  a significant--

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Could I interrupt you  for one  minute?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.1/31-2/1/95-30-

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Governor Lindsey  suggested  that we  just  decidedto--

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  To  turn  off  the  tape;  let's  turn  it  off.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I am neither endorsing nor  opposing  this.Governor  Lindsey suggested we just  agreed on  a procedure  for  turningthe  tape off.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  that  is  a valid request but  weare almost  through with  this.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Pardon me!

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  You would make a good  terrorist!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  What do  you think  they do on  weekends?

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  That  is  on  the  tape!

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Some may view him as  a terrorist  already.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Did the  subcommittee  discuss anythingsimilar  to  what  Bob Forrestal  just  said, namely,  that  only underextraordinary circumstances would it  be  appropriate  to have  assentingstatements  rather  than as  a general  rule?  Did you  discuss  thatquestion at  all?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I do not  believe we did.  We discussedrestrictions.  The whole  subcommittee  is  here.  I don't  rememberdiscussing  that.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think, Alan,  the general  feeling  of  thesubcommittee was  that  the  concurring  statements ought  to be anavailable option, but  there was  a general  feeling  that  such  statementswould not  be used often.  Now, there  is  no  real  way to  enforce  that.We  count  on  the  good judgment  of  every individual  member of  theCommittee, but  we count  on  the  good judgment  of  every member  of  theCommittee  for a whole  lot  of  things.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I do not  think we ever  discussed this  issue,but  I would guess,  like  Ed Boehne,  that  this  option would not  in  factbe  heavily  used.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can we make  the  issue  basically thatwhat  is  on  the  table  is  "assenting statements,  to  be used only withgreat  judiciousness"  or  something  like  that?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  This  is  a different  human naturethan  I am familiar with.  I think  I am closer to  Bob  Forrestal's viewof  it  as  a privilege rather  than a right.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Hoenig--I  am going down the  list.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  As  the Chairman  has  defined the proposal now, Icould live with  it.  But as  a concept,  let me  just  say, number one,  Ithink  that we  are a  consensus-building body and our  success  has  beenvery much built around  that.  I also  think  that  nuances  and1/31-2/1/95-31-differences  are reported and defined  in  the  minutes  so  that  theoutside world can  see  them.  I believe  it would be  a mistake to  beginhaving  concurring statements  unless  they are  extremely  limited.  Iwould define  that  as almost  never  if not  never.  Otherwise,  we  inviteinto  the process,  as Bob  Forrestal  said, a feeling of  obligation tostate a view because  one's  view is not  quite  the  same as  the  viewexpressed by another member  or a member wants  to  get  his  or her  nameon  the  record.  But more  importantly,  if  there are differences,  Ithink concurring  statements  invite  a proliferation of  statements.That then  opens  up even more  the  issue of  releasing  the minutessooner.  This  could take  us  down a very rocky road.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I must  say  I have  considerable sympathyfor  that  analysis  and  the view  that  there  is  a problem here.  Do  youmind if  I ask Don Winn a question?  Don,  I know  that  there  has beenvery little discussion of  this  issue  on  the  Hill.  Have you heard ofany?  Do you have any  sense of  where  the  committees  might  be  on  this?

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  I really do  not have the  sense  that  this  is  apoint  of  great  significance to  the  Hill people.  I don't  think we  needto  base  our determination in  terms  of  input  that we have  gotten  onthat.  I just  cannot  report  anything significant  on  either  side  of  theaisle.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  originally brought  this  notionforward, as  I recall,  when we were  looking  for ways  to be  more  open.I am wondering whether in  fact  we have  overreached.

[SECTION]

MR. WINN.  I think you recall  correctly, Mr. Chairman,  thatwe  came up with  it  as  an  alternative  to  some  of  the proposals  that  wewere getting  from the  Hill.  It  is  not  a Hill proposal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Just  to  say my piece, I had been  infavor  of  this  proposal,  but  I have been having  second thoughtsrecently.  I am willing to  go  along with whatever the majority wants,but  I must  say  that my enthusiasm for  this  is  fading.  The  type  ofargument  that  Tom Hoenig  and others have made  is  really difficult  toget  around.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I think this  came  up  originally when we werethinking of  ways  to  expand the minutes.  But subsequent  to  that,  Ibelieve, we  discovered that  the meetings were being recorded and werelease  our actions promptly to  the public.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mean  it  may be  moot  at  this  point?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Yes,  it  may be moot  at  this  point.  This  had alife  that  preceded our making  those decisions.  I think the  argumentsthat have  just been made are  very good, particularly in  light  of  thefact  that  we really are being rather forthcoming.  When it  was  stillthe  Mullins  subcommittee, I think  I was  in  favor  of  this.  But  enoughhas  changed  since  then  that  it  seems  to  me it  is  not  really a terriblyimportant  issue anymore.1/31-2/1/95-32-

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  As  a member  of  the subcommittee,  I want  toassociate myself  with what Ed just  said.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I would like  to  disassociate myself.  I feltstrongly that  this was  a way  to  provide more  information  to  thepublic.  I feel  even more  strongly about  it  now, given the  decisionthat we  just made  to  keep  our press  statements  extremely terse, whichis  the  majority view.  This  is  in  some  sense  a substitute  for  that.But having  said that,  I won't belabor  it.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I'm opposed to  concurring  statements because  itseems  to  me  the  only way they can be used is  to  express  reservationsor  reluctance to  go  along with the  majority.  I think  that  isinappropriate  for people  to  do.  If  they  feel  strongly enough about  akeep quiet about  it.  It  is  very divisive to  publicize,  even with a45-day  lag or  so,  degrees  to which people  are  or  are not  on board withthe  majority.  I think it  plays  into  the  hands of  people  on  the  Hilland elsewhere  in a very negative way.  In principle  I just  think thatconcurring statements  are wrong.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I think  it  is  an unfortunate bit  ofhistory  that people who dissent make  a statement  explaining thedissent.  It  is  fine to  dissent  if  one  thinks he  or  she  ought  to,  butI think the  dissenting vote  is  enough.  So,  it  is  very easy  tounderstand why  I think  that consenting opinions  are  truly a terribleidea.  I believe  the  function of  this  Committee  is  to  make  decisionson monetary policy.  That  is best  done  when the  Committee  reaches  itssupported  the majority but here  is why  I think my view is  a littledifferent  from what  is  stated in  the minutes  opens  us  up  tofactionalism.  I think Bob  Forrestal  is  right.  First  there would beone  statement,  and then there would be  two,  and then  there would beheaven  knows how many.  The press and the  Street would have  a fieldday deciding who is  in one  camp  and who is  in  the  other  camp.  I thinkit  would be  a terrible disservice  to the  great reputation and theenormous  responsibility of  this  Committee.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I used to  be very supportive  of  such  statements,but  in  light  of  all  the  changes  that we have made  that  are  clearly inthe  direction  of  openness,  I do  not  see  a necessity for  it  any longer.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I don't  think  the  opportunity to make  aconcurring statement  is  urgently needed by anybody around  this  table.Secondly,  I think a policy decision is  significantly weakened if,within  that  consensus, we have a half  dozen nuances  of  opinion.  Iwould be  strongly opposed to  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Initially, I came  at  this  wondering whether  itwas really possible  for us  to  prevent  anyone  from writing  a concurring1/31-2/1/95-33-statement  if  that member  absolutely wanted to  do  so  in  the  context  ofour  having dissenting  statements.  I am not  sure what  the  answer  is  tothat  question, but  I am much more  in  the  camp  of  those who  think thatsuch  statements  are  not  a good  idea  and are  divisive  in terms  of  theminutes  of  the meeting  and the  statement  of  the  consensus  as  a whole.Can  the  Committee administratively preclude  someone  from writing aconcurring  statement?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  A person  can write  a concurring  statement.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  But we  just  would not  include  it?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  It  is  not  included in  the  official  record ofthe  FOMC.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Okay.  [Laughter]  There  is  no  inalienableright or  anything like  that?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  No.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That  is  in  fact  the  status  quo--dissentingopinions  and no  assenting opinions.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Right, but  I didn't  know if  that  was by  rule.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The question  is,  is  it  by rule?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  Dissenting statements?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  No,  assenting  statements.  Is  there  a rule?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  My position would be  that  the  Committee canestablish  its  own rules.  If  the  Committee votes  not  to  allow aconcurring statement,  it  would seem  to  be within  the Committee'sright.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  At  the  risk of  jeopardizing  the  direction  inwhich this  conversation is  headed, which  I favor,  I will  point  outthat  I was  the minority  view on  the  subcommittee against  assentingstatements.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  a dangerous  position  to  take.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I think you  have moved into  the  majority!There  is  a strong consensus  on  this.  We  do not  require  a vote.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't  think so.  Well,  let me just  besure.  Does  anybody object  to  not moving toward  assenting  statementsbut  leaving  the minutes  essentially as  they  are, with only dissentingstatements  allowed?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Just  a point  of  information--I always  thoughtdissenting statements  were required.  They are  not?1/31-2/1/95-34-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Required by whom?

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  I have  always  been asked for  one whenever  Ihave dissented.  I didn't  want  to  bother  writing one.  [Laughter]  Ifyou are going  to  tell me  that  in  the  future  that  I have  less work todo  when I dissent,  I will be delighted.  [Laughter]  So,  I take itthat  there  is  no requirement  to  issue a dissenting  statement?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  is  no requirement.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you  for  the  point  of  information.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You have  saved  a few hours  a year!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Yes,  I hope not  to  dissent very much,  but--[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The  last  issue  is  the  currently symmetricblackout period--moving from  a symmetric  blackout period around themeeting date  to  an  asymmetric  period.  There  actually  is  no proposalon the  table.  Would you  like  to make a proposal,  Mr. Chairman?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No,  I have been agnostic  on  this.  I donot  have any  strong views.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I do  not  have  firm views  on this  either.  I wasthinking of  a blackout period covering  a week before  and  a day or  twoafter a meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Would you  explain what  the blackout  period  is?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  We now have a blackout period  in which none ofus  is  supposed  to  talk publicly about monetary policy a week beforethe FOMC meeting and a week after.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Monetary policy?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Monetary policy.  I think  that  is  right,  butcorrect me  if  I am wrong.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  rather  unfortunate  that  it  hasbecome  such an elastic  concept  that  I am not  certain what  that means.People  around here comment  on  data when  they come  out,  and that  isvery clearly related to  one's  position  on monetary policy.  I think  itwould be  useful  if  we  had a definition of  what this  is  all  about.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I do not  see  any reason  to  change  any of  ourrules  with respect to  how we  communicate with  the public.  I  think theblackout period is  appropriate.  It  is  consistent with  the  discussionwe  just had.  Our monetary policy  decision  should come  across  as athat  is  the  statement explaining  our  action.  Frankly, I have  takenthe view that  I am not going  to  talk about  any monetary policymight  not  talk about  it.  The  record of  the meeting  is  then public  butI have not,  for example,  taken  the  view that  after  one week  I am at1/31-2/1/95-35-liberty  to  talk  about what  the  Committee  decided and why.  I thinkthat  is  a very important rule.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  As  I remember what  this  issue was  about,there  was  a view in  the old days  that we  should not  discuss  anythingrelated  to monetary policy, which in  fact  includes virtuallyeverything that  everyone  around this  table  talks  about  when they  speakto  the press.  This  so-called blackout  is  very difficult  to  define.  Iam not sure what  it  is  and I was  wondering  if  Joe Coyne would justtake a second  to  give  us  a history of  this.

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  This  goes  back, I would  say, 15  years when  therewas  a lot  of  discussion in the  press  stemming from  comments made byvarious members  of  the  Committee  both before and after an FOMCmeeting.  Some  of  the papers  liked  to  do  a summary  story immediatelybefore  the meeting.  They would do  a round-robin,  calling all  19people.  They would compare answers  and  try to  figure  out  what wasgoing to  happen.  We were asked  to put  together  some  informalguidelines.  These are  not  "rules"  of  the  Committee.  They are  simplyguidelines  that  I have propagated to  the  Committee.  The purpose wasto  help  the  Committee  deal with  the press  in sensitive periods.  Oneof  the  things we came  up with, that  the  then-Chairman agreed with, wasthis blackout  period.  People were not  to  talk to  the press a weekbefore  and a week  after a Committee meeting.  The purpose was  to  tryto  prevent  all  the  speculation  in  the press  and subsequently  in thespeculation, but  we  get  it  from  commentators.  We do  not get  it  frommembers  of  the  Committee  anymore.  It has  worked to  an  extent.  It  hasnot worked 100  percent.  But  a lot  of members  of  the  Committee  use  theblackout  period to avoid talking  to  the press  during these  sensitiveperiods.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Joe,  are  you  suggesting that it  actuallyhas  been useful?

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  It  has been very useful  in my view.  If you  aregoing to  make  the blackout period asymmetrical,  I would say make  itasymmetrical  to  the  Friday  following  the meeting rather  than  for  justtwo days.  If  it  is  only two days,  then everybody will  jump on  itafter  48  hours,  and we are  still  going to  get  a lot  of  differentcomments.  One  of  the problems  is,  if  someone comments  one way, as  Mr.Forrestal  just  said, somebody else  is  going  to  try to  jump  the  otherway.  Then we are going to  get  more and more people commenting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So,  in a sense,  the  thrust  of  theannounced decision of  the  Committee  then gets  diluted in  the  same waythat  consenting statements  would do  that.

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  That  is  right.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  May I just  raise a question?  Is  there anycompelling reason to  change  the blackout period?

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  Someone asked whether  it  just  covered monetarypolicy.  It was  supposed to  cover monetary policy and the  economy--1/31-2/1/95-36-things  that  the  Committee  discusses  when it  is  formulating monetarypolicy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  My impression  is  that  if  a reasonablygood  reporter gets  one  of us  to  sit  and discuss  what  is  going on  inthe  economy, it  is  a farce  for  us  to  say,  "I won't  discuss monetarypolicy but  let me  tell  you what  is  going on  in  the economy."  It  is  afarce because, while  it  may be  that  in  the  old days  reporters  were notvery knowledgeable, many of  the current  breed have MAs and PhDs  ineconomics.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I was  taught  the  blackout policy by Joe  Coynewhen  I arrived here,  and it  was  that one  does not  talk about  theeconomy the week before and the week after.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Me,  too.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Exactly.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I think  the  answer to Bob Forrestal's  questionis  that  a change  is  not  compelling if  the Committee  does  not  think itis  compelling.  The current  blackout is  a leftover  from a time when wedid not  announce the  decision when we  made  it.  There was  still  somesecrecy  and there was  a lot  of  speculation as  to  what  the  FOMC  haddone.  Now there  isn't  and the  post meeting blackout now seems  like  ananachronism.  But  there certainly  is  no  urgency if  nobody wants--

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I would like  to  follow up my question byexpressing my belief  that  the blackout period as  it  now is  constructedserves  a very useful purpose.  I think  the  change  to an  immediateannouncement does  not  really affect  that.  I think we  ought  to  keep  itthe way  it  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  For  the  same  reason  that  the assentingstatements  are not  desirable?

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Yes,  exactly.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  There  is  another reason  and that  is  that  theseFOMC meetings are now hyped-up more by  the press--before and after--and I don't  think we ought  to  contribute  to  that  hype.  Even thoughour practice  is  not perfect and it  is  only a guideline, I personallyhave  found  it  to  be  very useful  just  to  say, look,  there  are two weeksthat  I am not  going to  talk  to  you people.  If you want  to  talk aboutsome banking condition or  something  like  that,  that  is  a differentstory.  But  as  a general proposition,  I just do  not  talk  to  the pressfor  the  two  weeks around  the  Committee meeting.  As  I said,  I havefound it  to be personally very useful,  and I think it  collectivelykeeps us  from this hyping  up of  Committee meetings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any objections  to what Ed  is  proposing?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I think,  first of  all,  that  the blackout wasdefined so  that we never, never,  never talk  about what goes  on  at anFOMC meeting, period--whether that  is  one week before,  two  weeksbefore,  eight weeks before, or  seventeen weeks after.  It  is  not  anissue of  talking about  the  FOMC because we never should.  I have noright  to  tell  someone what  any of  you said;  that  is  your business.1/31-2/1/95-37-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  To my knowledge,  as  long  as  I have beenhere  there  has never been  a breach  of  that  confidence.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  That  is  correct  and  I think  that  is  important.We  should separate  out  the  FOMC  from  the blackout  issue.  I  think nottalking  to  the  press  about economics  or monetary  policy  is  very usefulthe  week before because  of  the  issue  of  how we are going  to  vote.  Ifwe  do,  reporters are  going to write  it  all  up  in  the  Sundaysupplements.  It  probably was  useful  to  have  the  blackout  after themeeting while  there  was  some ambiguity about how we voted, but  inpractice  I think that,  given  the  obligations we have  to  the public  toexplain  our views,  allowing us  to  talk about  the  economy and giveeconomic  speeches  the  week after  is  not  unreasonable.  Otherwise, weare  in  a  situation where we are  in blackout  literally one-third of  thetime.  I can respect  the people  who  like  that  situation, but  it  isvery, very difficult.  If  we are  going  to have  the  kind of  strictblackout  that Joe  discussed where  we  do not  talk  about monetary policyor  the  economy,  then  I suggest  we  limit  it  to  one week per meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  President Melzer  is  on the  list.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I just  wanted to  clarify what you were  saying,Alan.  I think you  are right  in  terms  of  individuals never beingidentified.  We  did have that  very difficult  period where  the  leaks  toThe Wall  Street Journal  and  others  covered Committee  deliberations  andpositions.  To make sure  I understand  it  correctly, what  I want  toconfirm is  that we really  should never be  talking about what went  onin  an  FOMC meeting  in  terms  of  who  said what.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Ever.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I had  forgotten  about  that  incident.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That  is  not what this  proposal  is  about.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  It  is  a good defense mechanism.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  This proposal  is  only  about  talking  to  thepress  about  things  that  under normal  circumstances  we  can  talk  to  thepress  about.  That  excludes  the  FOMC  discussion.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Isn't  there  another element  to  the  blackout  in

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Because  of  Humphrey-Hawkins.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Yes,  the blackout  covers  the period between  themeeting and  the Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes,  okay.  Mike.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  First  of  all,  I think any  of  us  can  set  ablackout period if  we  want to.  We  can just  say, my policy is  not  tospeak  to  the press  for  a week before,  a week after,  or whatever  thetime period  is,  and the  press will  respect  that  if  we set  it.  Any  ofus  has  that  ability.  I can  see  a blackout  the week before.  I think1/31-2/1/95-38-it  makes good  sense  that we  not  talk about  the  economy or  monetarypolicy before  the meeting.  After  the  meeting, I view us  as  havingmade a consensus  decision;  we are  going to  go  out  and try  to  explainit  to people.  I think  that  helps  in  the  education  of  people  and  thebetter understanding of  monetary policy.  I could see  some  limitedblackout time after  a meeting--perhaps 48  hours  or  as Joe  suggeststhrough Friday.  I would go with a more limited period after  meetingsthan one week.  I wouldn't  tie  everyone's  hands  for  a full weekafterward because I think it  can be a great  benefit to  the  Committeeand to what  we are  trying to  explain.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I have always  looked at  Joe's verygood guidelines as  a reminder to  all  of  us  to be prudent.  That can bebetween the meeting and the Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony because we donot  want  to preempt what  the  Chairman is  likely to  say.  That  is  easybecause usually we do  not  know!  [Laughter]  But  now that  we announcethe  decision, we  could all  look  rather  foolish if  somebody were  tosay,  "Well, you raised  interest rates  on such-and-such a date, didn'tyou?"  We don't want  to  say,  "Sorry, I can't  say anything about  that."So  I think  the  blackout  is  a reminder to be prudent.  I think it  isvery, very  important  for  us  to  be quiet during the week before  themeeting  so that we do  not provide  the  entertainment  in  the  Sundaysupplement.  After the meeting, it  would  seem to  me  that  one has  to  becareful  not  to  reveal positions  for  just  the  reasons  that  we do  notwant concurring opinions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Maybe Joe's  suggestion  is  a goodcompromise on  this.  In  other words,  a blackout through the  end of  theweek rather  than  a full  week probably captures most  of  what  everyonewould be concerned about.  Does  anybody object  to  that  as  a solutionto  this dilemma?  If  not, Joe,  why don't we just  change  it  to bethrough--are we always meeting on a Tuesday?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  No, tomorrow is  a Wednesday.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  This  year we have  one Wednesdaymeeting  in November because  of  the  BIS  conflict.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  We  can say  the  balance of  the  week of  themeeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't we  just  leave  it  at  thebalance of  the week?  Okay?

[SECTION]

MR. COYNE.  Fine.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  We have  exhausted this  issue.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  We certainly have.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  This  issue  and ourselves!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Now, let  us  get  to  the  easy issue  ofinflation  targeting!  It  has  been suggested, and I think it's a goodidea,  that we  have pro and con  statements  on inflation  targeting.  Ihave asked President  Broaddus  and Governor Yellen  to  take  the  pro andthe  con.  Al,  why don't you get  started?1/31-2/1/95-39-

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I appreciate theopportunity  to  make a few comments  about  inflation  targeting.Actually,  I am going  to use  the  term  "inflation objectives,"  if  I may,because  I think that  describes  and reflects  more accurately what  Ihave  in mind.  To my mind, this  is  an  idea whose  time has definitelycome.  Let me  cover  just  three  things.  I will  try  to  do  this  asbriefly and compactly as  I can  and still  get  the  main points  across.First,  I will  summarize  as  clearly as  I can  the  analytical  case  forsome kind of  explicit  inflation  objective.  Then, I want to  comment  onjust  one  of  the  most  frequently heard objections.  Finally, I wouldlike to  say a little  about what  specific  kinds  of  objectives we mightwant  to  introduce and  how we  might proceed if  the  Committee  decides,and  I hope  it will,  that  this  is  a good  idea and wants  to  move  in  thisdirection.  In  doing  this,  I will build on  Dave Lindsey's  memorandumthat  I think did a very nice  job of  laying  out  the  main  issues  andconsiderations in  a balanced way.Very briefly, the basic  argument,  as  I see  it,  forimplementing an operationally meaningful  explicit  inflation  objectiveis  that  it  would allow us  over  time  to  foster a better economicperformance.  This  would occur,  in brief,  because we would be movingaway  from the  almost  purely discretionary approach  to policy we  havefollowed historically, with  its  focus  on  reacting to  emerging short-term economic  developments,  toward an  approach where  the central  focuswould be  on precommitment to  a permanent  low  inflation objective  thatwould be  clear and  feasible.  Of  course,  on  the  face of  it,  theassertion I just made  that  changing our approach to  policy in  this wayis  going  to  improve  economic performance  is  just  that;  it  is  anassertion.  But  I think it  is  fair to  say  that  it  is  supported  bymuch, if  not most,  of  the  important research done  in monetaryeconomics  over the  course of  the  last  twenty years.  Dave  Lindseyalludes  to  this when he  refers  to  such  issues  as  how the public  andthe market  form expectations  about  future inflation and how theseexpectations  and  the way they  are  formed relate to  monetary policy andits  effect  upon the  economy--the  so-called  time-inconsistency problemand all  of  that.  Beyond these  theoretical considerations,  however,experience over  the  years under our  current  approach to policy, withaccelerations and  then decelerations  and then re-accelerations  ofinflation, suggests  that periodic  inflation  scares  in  the  financialmake  a lot  of people  think there  has  got  to  be  a better way.Against  that  broad background, let me  quickly list  some  ofthe most  important  advantages  that  I see  for  a credible  inflationobjective.  Many of  these  are  also  noted by Dave  in  his memorandum.First, by  signalling the disinflation  in  advance, a credible  inflationobjective very likely would reduce the  real  cost  of  transitioning  to  apermanently lower  inflation rate.  Moreover, related  to  this,  thecredible  objective would allow  the  Committee  to pursue  a more  activistpolicy more  freely  in the  short  run without worrying about  losingcredibility.  The  situation we  face  today is  a good example  of  this.Since we probably have not yet  seen  the  full  effect on  the  economy ofour  tightening  actions  last year, and we are  already beginning  to  seeat  least a few signs  of  moderation in  aggregate demand,  one could makea case  for caution in  approaching any further  tightening  in policytoday.  However, under our  current  approach to  policy, there  obviouslyis  a big  risk.  If we  exercise  such caution,  it  could bemisunderstood, reduce  our  credibility, conceivably produce  an1/31-2/1/95-40-inflation  scare in  financial  markets, and destabilize the  economy.That  is  one point.Next,  an explicit  inflation  objective would be  an  efficientway to  break  out  of  our current  Humphrey-Hawkins reporting  conundrum.The problems with targeting monetary aggregates  are well  known toeverybody  including Congressmen.  Consequently, in  the Humphrey-Hawkins  process, I would argue  that  if  we  continue to  focus  a sizableamount  of  our attention on  the  aggregates,  we will  look  a littlesilly.  On  the other hand,  if  we don't provide  some  substitute, werisk having our agenda  set  for us  with the  focus  on whatever short-term problems seem  to  be most  pressing at  the  time  as distinct  from acoherent,  consistent longer-term strategy that  befits  a central bankof  our standing and stature.Finally, it  is worth noting  that  a number  of  other  industrialcountries, as  I am  sure  all  of  you are  aware,  have establishedexplicit  longer-term inflation objectives  in one  form  or  another.Most  of  these have been put  into place over  the course  of  the  lastthree or  four years.  I think the motive  in most  cases has  been to  tryto  lock  in  currently low inflation  rates.  Obviously, we  have onlylimited  experience with  these new procedures, but  if  they arereasonably successful  over  time,  and  I think they very likely will  be,I am not  sure we want  to  be  one of  the  few  industrial  countries  notmoving in  this direction.  It  is  true,  as Dave mentioned in hismemorandum,  that  the  Bundesbank does  not  have explicit  inflationobjectives,  but  it  does  have a strong legal  mandate  for pricestability, and of  course,  it  has very broad public  support rooted inlong and bitter  historical experience.  These are  the main positivearguments  for an explicit  inflation  objective as  I see  them.Just  quickly on  the  main objection to  such  an  approach:  AsDave points  out,  the main objection  is  that  a short-term trade-off  issaid to  exist between  real  activity and inflation.  Critics  ofinflation objectives  consequently argue  that we can maximize ourcontribution to public welfare  and to  economic welfare by  exploitingthat  trade-off.  Hence,  they argue  that  anything  that prevents us  fromdoing that,  like  tying  our hands  with an explicit inflation  target ofsome  sort, would be  undesirable.  As  Dave  indicates,  this  argumentwould seem  to be most  compelling in  the  case  of  supply shocks,  likethe  oil  shocks  back  in  the  1970s.  But  as  I see  it,  this  argumentreally does  not have  a whole lot  of  punch except  in  the  limiting  caseof  a very rigid,  inflexible numerical  inflation  objective.  Ingeneral,  as  I see it  at  least,  there is  nothing  incompatible between acredible  long-term inflation  objective  on  the  one hand and having  theflexibility  to  cushion the  economy against  supply  shocks as  long  asthe  public understands  and  is  confident  that  the  longer-termcommitment remains  in place while we  are dealing with the  short-termproblem.  Indeed, far  from reducing  our  flexibility, it  seems  to  methat  a credible  long-term  objective  arguably would increase  ourflexibility  in dealing with such  shocks because we would not beworried about  losing  credibility in  that  situation.Let  me move  to  the  final  issue  I want  to  address:  that  is,exactly how we  should go  about establishing  a credible  commitment--exactly what  kind  of objective  should we  set and what should we  tellthe  Congress?  I want  to  recommend  that  we need something moreconcrete  to  back it  up.  An  important point here  is  that  the  inflation1/31-2/1/95-41-objective  should not be  used  in  the way that we used the  old moneysupply targets,  that  is,  as  a mechanism for  guiding  short-term,tactical monetary policy actions.  I apologize  for  the  repetition:The purpose  of  an  inflation  objective  is  to  commit  ourselves  crediblyto  maintaining  the purchasing power  of  our  currency, like  theBundesbank's  legal  mandate does  in Germany.  I have to  confess  I hadto  think about  this  a lot,  and my staff  had to  get me  in a room andpursuade me of  this.  With these things  in mind, I would argue  that weshould not adopt  a numerical  target  even  in  the  form  of  a rangebecause  I think that would set us  up  for  failure.  Instead,  I wouldrecommend  that  the  Committee  commit  itself  firmly and publicly to  theobjectives  contained in  the Neal  amendment with  respect both  to  thelanguage of  the  amendment  in  the way  that  it  defines price stabilityand also  importantly with respect  to  the  5-year time horizon.  As  forcommunicating  this,  the  Chairman could  state  in his  upcoming Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony that  the  Committee  is  considering  taking this  step,perhaps  in  the  summer,  given the  increasingly obvious problems withfocusing  on  the money supply targets  in  the  Humphrey-Hawkins process.The  Chairman could also urge  the  Congress  to  pass  the Neal  amendment.I recognize  that  the  amendment has  not gotten  significant  support todate, but  the election has clearly changed  the  makeup of  Congress  agood bit,  and again  the  technical  problems with using the  money supplyas  a nominal  anchor are  increasingly apparent  to  all.  I think we  canexplain  it  against that  backdrop.Finally,  as  I see  it,  there  are  some very  strong advantagesto  proceeding  in  the way that  I just  suggested.  For one  thing, we arealready on  record in  favor  of  the  Neal  amendment.  Doing  this wouldnot  be a radical  departure  from  the  position the  Committee has  takenearlier.  Also--this  is  very  important--doing what  I have  suggestedwould not prevent  the  Fed from  taking  the  kinds of  policy  actions  thatwe  take today to  stabilize  employment  and output.  What  it  would do,and  this probably is  the most  important  thing I am saying  today,  is  todiscipline  us  to  justify  our short-term actions  designed to  stabilizeoutput and employment  against  our commitment  to protect  the purchasingpower of  our currency.In this  respect,  and this  is  also  an  important part of  what  Iwould propose, I would recommend that  we begin publishing  some sort  ofinflation report,  perhaps  semi-annually,  in conjunction with  theHumphrey-Hawkins process  along  the  lines  of  the  report  that  iscurrently put  out by the  Bank of  England.  That  would help  guide us  inmaking our  short-term policy decisions,  and  it would also  publiclyunderscore  our  longer-term  commitment.  My view is  that  if  we agree  todo  this,  the  report  should be prepared by the  Committee's  staff,drawing on  any System resources  the  staff wants  to  draw on.  If we  dothis,  it  seems  reasonable  to  me  to presume  that progress  towardachieving  our  inflation objective would naturally  supplant  the moneysupply targets,  especially  the  short-run money  supply targets, as  aprincipal  focus  of  the  Bluebook and other  staff presentations.  Forexample,  the  short-term policy alternatives  that we always  have in  theBluebook could be  discussed at  least  in part  from  the perspective  oftheir  consistency with  our  long-term inflation objectives,  the  rate  ofprogress  toward  that  objective, and any risk  that  a particularalternative would present with regard  to missing  the  objective andrelated matters.1/31-2/1/95-42-Let me  end by saying  that  I realize  that  an  explicitinflation objective  is  not  a magic wand:  it  is  not  going to  solve allour problems;  it  is  not going to  solve  all  the world's problems;  it  isnot  going to  grow any hair on my head.  But  I do  think  the  kind  ofobjective  that  I suggested is  a practical  one and I believe  it  is  afeasible one.  Over  time,  I am  convinced that  it  could help  improveand increase our contribution  to  the nation's  economic welfare.  Irest my case.

[SECTION]

GOVERNOR YELLEN.  I am strongly opposed to  the  adoption offormal multi-year  inflation  targets.  I thought  I would begin byoutlining the  case  against  them.  This proposal has  two  distinctfeatures.  The  first has  to do with  the number  of goals  we  should bepursuing, a single goal  or multiple goals.  I am taking  this proposalto be  essentially the  strong one that  Dave  Lindsey  suggested in hismemo, namely, that  the  inflation  rate  should be  the  sole  objective  ofpolicy  for  current  and  future years with no weight  being placed onachieving competing, ultimate goals  for real  variables.  I am going tospeak against  that proposal,  and I note  that  it  is  a somewhat  strongerproposal  than  I heard Al  just  support.  The  second aspect  of  theproposal has  to  do with numerical  as  opposed to  qualitative targets.Since  I am particulary opposed  to  the  single  goal,  that  is  what mostof my remarks  are  going to  focus  on  rather  than  the  numericalcharacter  of  it.I began by asking myself  the  question, what  is  it  that  thepublic  cares about?  The answer  seems  straightforward  to me.  It  isnot  just  high and variable inflation;  that  is  not  the  only aspect  ofeconomic  performance people  care about.  The public  also  cares aboutreal  outcomes.  Households  and businesses very much dislikefluctuations  in  output and employment,  for good  reasons.  Quitenaturally, they prefer higher  average  output and lower averageunemployment.  I consider these goals  eminently sensible,  not  foolishnor  irrational.Then I ask myself, what  is  it  that  the  Fed can  accomplish?  Iconclude  that  the actions  of  this  Committee  affect not  just  the  leveland variability of  inflation  but also  at  a minimum the variablity  ofoutput and employment.  I know that  some people  would argue  againstour  trying to  reduce  the  variability  of  output  on the grounds  thateconomic  forecasting  is  so  uncertain  and that  there  are  long  andvariable  lags  in monetary policy,  so  maybe all  we would do  is  todestabilize  the  economy  rather than  stabilize  it.  But when I look atthe  record,  I just do  not  agree.  It  seems  to  me  the  record  shows  thatwithin  limits,  tuning works even  if  it  is  not  "fine."  The  proof ofthe pudding  is  in the  eating.  I would give  the  Greenspan Fed a gradeof close  to A  for  its performance.  I see  this  Committee  as havingbeen  leaning against  the wind and, by  so doing,  significantlymitigating fluctuations  in output and raising  social welfare  in  theprocess.The moral I draw  is  simply  that  the Fed  should pursuemultiple goals.  It  follows  almost  automatically that when theAmerican people have  sensible multiple goals and  the  Federal  Reserveaffects multiple dimensions of  economic performance,  that  the FederalReserve Act  should enshrine all  of  those goals  and we  should do  ourbest  to honor  them.  I simply  can't  see  how we  could supportlegislation that  in the  extreme case,  not quite  what Al  just1/31-2/1/95-43-supported, would in  essence direct us  to  abrogate  our responsibilityfor  stabilization policy.  I think it  would be  dangerous  at  a timewhen  fiscal policy has  been disabled for use  in  stabilization.  Iunderstand that  the  mandate  of  the  Federal  Reserve Act  to  pursuemultiple goals  is  pretty vague.  There really  is  no  guidance in  theAct  as  to  how to  call  the  tough  trade-offs.  But  I see  the  objectivesas  fundamentally sound,  and I think  this  Fed, in  pursuing those goals,has  enhanced social welfare.Fortunately, the  goals  of price  stability and outputstability  are often  in harmony, but when the  goals conflict and itcomes  to  calling  for  tough  trade-offs,  to me,  a wise  and humane policyis  occasionally to  let  inflation rise  even when  inflation  is  runningabove  target.  Supply shocks,  of  course,  like  those  in  the  '70s arethe most obvious  case.  To have  avoided any uptick  in inflation wouldhave  required such  a dramatic  tightening of monetary policy that  therewould have been a downturn of  even more  major proportions.  With  thebenefit  of  hindsight,  it  seems  to  me  that maybe the  Fed should haveaccepted more  unemployment and  less  inflation.  There has  been  avaluable  lesson there  for  all  of  us.  But  the extreme proposal--thatwe need  to  counter shocks with  a pure  inflation  target--is  to  medraconian.  More recently in  1990-91,  this Committee was  sensiblyloosening monetary policy before price  stability was  achieved and, tomy mind, producing better  economic  results  as  a consequence.I do  not want  to  belabor  this  point;  we  could discuss  it  ingreat detail.  However,  I want  at  least  to  mention that  if  thisCommittee were  to  decide  that  it  really wanted a quantitative monetarypolicy rule  incorporating a numerical  inflation target--for  example,because  it  was  thought  to  be  important to  have  a nominal  anchor  formonetary policy--we  should not  go  with the  type of  rule  embodied inthe Neal  amendment, which is  a pure inflation  targeting scheme.  Why?Because  there clearly are  better rules.  We  could talk  about  those  atlength but  a simple  approach, not necessarily  the best,  that  dominatesinflation targeting would be  a hybrid rule  that would adjust monetarypolicy--and  this  could be  a mechanical  rule  if  it  were  so desired--onthe basis  of  two  gaps,  not  one.  These would be  the gap between  actualand target  inflation  and also  the  gap between actual  and potentialoutput.The  next question  is,  what do  central  banks  really do?  WhenI look at  the  behavior of  the  FOMC  and other  central banks,  I simplycan't  find a lot  of  cases  in  which monetary policy has  ever  beendriven by an  exclusive  focus  on  inflation performance.  Consider,  forexample,  the policy of  the  Bundesbank--whose  price stabilitycommitment,  it  seems  to me,  is  not  seriously  in question.  How do  theybehave?  They deliberately tightened monetary policy  in  1991,  but  byhow much?  Not by enough to  keep  inflation  from rising even thoughthey knew inflation would rise.  They deliberately chose  to  tighten byless  than what was  called for  to  keep  that  from  occurring.  Now, ifyou  take  the  case of  the  FOMC,  it  seems  to me  that a reaction functionin which the  real  funds  rate  changes by roughly equal  amounts  inresponse  to  deviations of  inflation from  a target  of  2 percent  and  todeviations  of  actual  from potential  output  describes  tolerably wellwhat  this Committee  has done  since  1986.  This policy, which fits  thebehavior of  this  Committee,  is  an  example of  the  type  of  hybrid  rulethat would be preferable  in my view,  if we  wanted a rule.  I think the1/31-2/1/95-44-Greenspan  Fed has  done very well by  following  such  a rule,  and I thinkthat  is what  sensible central banks  do.Let  me turn  to the  issue  of  credibility.  A key argument infavor  of  inflation  targeting--Al made  this point--is  that  it  wouldraise  the  FOMC's  credibility and result  in a lower  sacrifice ratio.Clearly, if  we  could achieve  this,  it would be a very worthwhilebenefit.  The problem in my view is  that  it  is not  achievable.  First,when  I look  at  the  experience  of  countries  that have adopted andcarried  through  inflation targeting programs,  I consider the  resultsdiscouraging.  Then,  I think about  the Bundesbank and ask myself whyit  is,  if  credibility really  lowers  the  sacrifice  ratio,  that  theBundesbank bore  such high  costs,  or  rather Germany bore  such highcosts,  first  in  1980-83  and then  from  1992  through  the present  in  itsefforts  to  reduce  inflation.  Then,  I look  at  empirical  estimates  thatsuggest  that  the  German  sacrifice  ratio  actually exceeds  ours, whereasI think  there  is  little doubt  that  their credibility probably exceedsours.The  second point concerning credibility is  that  I do notthink  inflation  targets would raise  credibility for  the  simple reasonthat  they would not be credible.  Who would be prepared to believethat  the  FOMC  is  single-mindedly going  to pursue  an  inflation  targetregardless  of real  economic  performance,  if  not  even  the  Bundesbank  isprepared to  go  that  far?  So,  that means  that  the  targets  are  going tobe perceived as  a hoax.  They  are not  going to  be  any more believablethan I would be  if  I told my  child that  I was going to  cut  off hishand if  he  put  it  in the  candy drawer.  To me, an  inflation  targetingstrategy could easily undermine  the  Fed's  credibility and reputationbecause  the  policy  itself  just  is  not  credible.Let me  conclude.  We  could talk a little  about dynamicinconsistency, but  for  the  sake  of  time  I think I will pass  that upunless someone wants  to  come back  to  it.  Let me  just make  a finalpoint.  My final  concern in connection with FOMC  support of  inflationtargeting legislation  like  the Neal  amendment,  or  some new version ofthat,  relates  to what we  will  do  if we  go  to  Congress to  testify  forit.  My  concern here  is  that we will most  likely end up understatingthe  cost.  My guess  is  that we  will  argue  that price  stability is  agoal  of  overriding importance,  that  it  is  so  important  and sobeneficial  that  it  should be  pursued at  all  costs.  In  truth,  I thinkwe have  excellent  evidence  that  the  one-time  cost  of  loweringinflation  is  high.  Each percentage point  reduction  in  inflation costson the  order  of  4.4  percent  of  gross  domestic product,  which  is  about$300  billion, and  entails  about  2.2  percentage-point-years  ofunemployment  in excess  of  the natural  rate.If  we  testify, it  seems  to me  that we  should point  out  thatthe benefits  of price  stability are  elusive and  that  the  costs  ofadditional  output  instability with  such  a plan could easily outweighthe  benefits  of greater  inflation  stability.  Why?  Becauseuncertainty  about  sales  impedes  business planning and could harmcapital  formation  just  as much  as uncertainty about  inflation  cancreate uncertainty about  relative prices  and harm business planning.I noticed  that  the Neal  resolution  contained a preamble,  and it  readin part,  "whereas zero  inflation promotes  the  highest possiblesustainable  level  of  employment,  the maximum sustainable  rate  ofeconomic growth,  and  the highest  possible rate  of  savings and1/31-2/1/95-45-investment..."  I found  it  interesting  to  contrast  this with  theconclusion  of  the Federal  Reserve  System's  price stability  andeconomic performance project  in  1989  that  read,  "We have  investigatedboth direct  and  indirect  evidence surrounding  the hypothesis  thatinflation adversely affects  the performance  of  the  real  economy.  Thebottom  line of  these  efforts probably will not  be  surprising.  Itremains exceptionally  difficult  to  uncover  clear-cut evidence  thatmoderate  rates  of  inflation  reduce perceptibly the  growth or  level  ofmeasured GDP."My  final  point  is  that,  from a political  standpoint,  if  wesupport  an  inflation  targeting  amendment,  and we do  so  withoutappropriately  emphasizing  its  costs  in order  to  obtain a mandate  toachieve price stability at  all  costs,  I believe  there will beconsequences  for us.  We will  end up being blamed when  the realitiesfalsify  the belief that  this  is  close  to a free  lunch.  On  this point,I would like  to  conclude by quoting a remark made by  former FOMC  ViceChairman Corrigan, which I gleaned  from the  transcripts of  theshould be  "excruciatingly careful  about what we  claim."  He said,  "Ido worry a bit  that  in  our collective  zeal,  we've got  to  be  carefulnot  to  oversell what  can be  done  and at  what  cost.  Because  if we  doleave  the  impression  of  a cost  and  it  turns  out  to  be  a lowballestimate,  we  are  going  to  get  fried.  There  is  just no  question  aboutthat  whatsoever."

MR. JORDAN.  I think Al  laid  out very well  the  arguments  asto why setting  inflation objectives would be  desirable and helpful  forthe Committee  to  do  in  accomplishing our mandate.  I took JanetYellen's  response  as  being a combination  of  implementation problemsversus  desirability issues,  and  those  I think we need  to  discussWhat we would want  to  do  is  wave  it  and have businesses  and householdsin  the  country make their decisions  in the  expectation  that  anyincreases  in  inflation--and in  associated nominal  interest rates--aretemporary and will  be  reversed.  I would argue  that we want  to  returnto  a period  like  the  one we had in  the  1950s  and  early 1960s  whenpeople looked  at  the  shocks  that happened along the  way as  transitory.That  is  because  they were  confident  that  the  central bank wouldconduct its  affairs  in  such  a way that  inflation  rates would move  inthe  direction of  zero  and  associated nominal  interest rates  to  lowlevels.  I believe  that  the Bundesbank is  in  that position today.just about  high and variable inflation;  what  they care  about  isstandards  of  living.  She  is  raising  a different  type  of  issue--whether or not  that mindset  on  the part  of  the  American public wouldin  fact  achieve the  kind of rising  standards  that  they want.  Theywant  to  be  as  rich as  possible over  time.  If  we  believe  thatstabilizing the purchasing power of  money achieves  that  condition  ofmaking people  the  richest possible over time,  then  that is  what wewant  to  do.  When I address  the  question of  the appropriateness  ofmonetary policy such as  at  this meeting today  and tomorrow, I cannotdo  it  thinking only about what  is  going to  happen  to  the  CPI  or anyother measure  of  the  purchasing  power of  money  in  1995.  We  all  know1/31-2/1/95-46-about  long  and variable lags.  I also  cannot do  it  based on  anybody'sforecast  or unfolding  events as  they  occur with  regard  to  output  andemployment.  I can only do  it  with  regard to  what  is  going  to  happento  the  future rate  of  inflation,  at  the  soonest  in  the  second year  andmuch more  likely in  the  third  and  fourth years.  Ultimately,  I come  toa conclusion about what monetary policy is  appropriate by askingmyself  what  is  going  to happen  to  inflation  in  1996  and  1997.  If  itis  going back down,  and if  people  have confidence  that  that  is  what weare going  to  produce and  they make  their  decisions  based on  that,  thenI think that  monetary policy  is  appropriate.  If  not,  then  I saymonetary policy is  not appropriate.  I would think  that  the Americanpublic  would want  to  have confidence  in  assessing our monetary policyobjectives,  as distinct  from monetary policy actions,  by askingwhether  we are going  to produce  a lower  inflation  rate  sometime out  inthe  future.  That  is  what an  inflation objective  does.

[SECTION]

PRESIDENT MINEHAN.  I think  there  are  two  issues  here andthey tend to  get  mixed up.  One  is  whether  or not  we should beexplicit about  our objectives  over  a reasonably long period of  time.The  second  is whether  or not we  should  focus  solely on price  stabilityor  inflation measures as  a target  of  monetary policy.  Looking at  thelatter  issue  first,  I would be  very much  in agreement  with GovernorYellen  that  monetary policy should not  focus  on  only one  target.  Weneed to  recognize  the  short-term trade-offs  between  inflation andeconomic  growth,  and we  should not  beholden ourselves  to  a singlemeasure  in  judging our  effectiveness  as  a central  bank.  Getting awayfrom focusing  on a single  target  for monetary policy,  is  there a casefor  being more  explicit about what we  are doing over a longer  timeperiod?  In  thinking about  that,  I ask myself what  problem are wedealing with here?  I do  not  think the problem  is  that we  have notdemonstrated a commitment  to  inflation  fighting.  We have  committedourselves  to  inflation fighting.  We went  through a period of highinflation and high  interest  rates  in  the  early 1980s--when I tried  toget  a mortgage and  the  terms were 19-3/4 percent  and 5 points--and weweathered that period, but we paid a big price  for  it.  I think wehave been  fighting  inflation very effectively since  then whilerecognizing the  short-term tradeoffs with  economic growth.The problem we  really have here is  that we have  acommunications vehicle that we  are required by  law to  use.  Itinvolves  the monetary aggregates,  and  there are not many people whobelieve  that  they  are an  effective  communications vehicle  anymore.  Weneed to  think  about  communications  vehicles  that  are appropriate  interms  of  explaining to  Congress  what we  are doing over  a period oftime.  I do  not  think  that Congress harbors  any suspicion  that we  arenot  fighting inflation.  I think they  have the  suspicion that  we aretoo willing  to  fight  it,  that  we are  too willing  to  sacrifice economicgrowth and employment  in pursuit  of  inflation  targets.  In my view, weshould either  leave well  enough alone  or we  should adopt  a series  ofmulti-faceted targets  that might be  better  communications vehicles  toCongress  than  the monetary aggregates.  Janet  described using  tworanges  or  two kinds  of  gaps.  We  also  could use nominal  GDP,  if  wewanted, as  a target  or range  or  something  like  that.  So  that  is  how Icome out  on  this.  Frankly, I don't know  if we  can  really decide  thisissue.  This  is  a big issue.  We  received a good paper, and I would bein  favor  of  trying to  refine our  thinking, however we  come out,  andget  something  explicit on  the  table  before we  take  a vote  on  this.1/31-2/1/95-47-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  just  say what  I think the  purposeof  this  discussion is.  To  go  to  inflation  targeting without aCongressional  statute is  probably unwise.  We  do not  have a Neal bill,but  there clearly  is  going  to  be  a Connie Mack bill  that will be  veryclose  to  the Neal  bill,  and we are  going to  be asked to  comment  on  it.The  basic purpose of  this  discussion is  to  get  our  first  cut  as  towhere this  Committee  stands  for purposes  of  testifying  on  thatlegislation.  My  own judgment  is  that  if  we do not  announce anyspecific  inflation  targets,  our policy  can actually be  similar  to whatAl  Broaddus was  suggesting.  If we  do announce  explicit  inflationtargets,  they become in  effect  a statutory obligation  for  thisCommittee  to  adhere  to;  and  I am not  sure by any  reading of  theHumphrey-Hawkins  statute  that  inflation  targeting  is  consistent withit.  But  as  I said, there  is  a real  legislative  issue  coming up onwhich we are  going to  have  a very significant effect,  depending on howwe  testify.  I think it  is  a real  issue.  It  is very important  forthose  of  us who  are  going  to  testify  on  that bill  to  know where  theCommittee members  are  since we will  be  speaking  for  them.  PresidentMelzer.

[SECTION]

PRESIDENT MELZER.  Alan,  in general,  I would  associate myselfwith what  Presidents  Broaddus  and Jordan had to  say.  I have my owntwo questions,  a la  Cathy.  My first  is  whether we  agree that  theprimary focus  of  monetary policy should be  on  achieving pricestability.  Secondly, do we agree  that we  are more  likely to  achieveprice  stability and be  credible  if we  set  specific  targets  forinflation?With respect  to  the  first  question,  I take  a very simple-minded approach.  My view is  that  monetary policy  only affects pricesin  the  long  run.  I have  a hard time  justifying setting objectiveswith  respect  to  things  that we  can't  influence  in  the  long run.  So,  Iwould very much like  to  set  objectives  that are  consistent and that wecan  influence in  the  long run.  I might add--this  is  something  towhich Al  has  already alluded--that  I don't  think we  have  the  expertiseto  fine-tune  the economy on  the  real  side  in  any timeframe because  ofthe vagaries  of  forecasting and because  of  the uncertain  effects ofthe  policy actions  that we  take.  Frankly, even though  the  record ofthe  FOMC  has  been pretty good over  the  last  ten  or  fifteen years,  myview is  that  one  could conclude  that  perhaps  our  actions  to  stabilizeactually have been destabilizing  from time to  time.  We made  someprogress  in  bringing  inflation down, but we  are  still  a long distanceaway from what  I would consider  to  be price stability  even  though wegive  lip  service  to  that  concept.  The point  that Al  touched  on, whichI think is very  important, is  that  in  the  regime  that we are  in rightnow, trying to  serve  two masters,  we  are  incurring  transition costsall  the  time  in both directions.  As perceptions  change  concerningwhat  we have  in mind as  an acceptable rate of  inflation,  there arenecessary adjustments  on  the  real  side.  One can  talk about  thetransition  costs  to  zero inflation, but at  least  they are  incurredonly once  and  once we  have  zero  inflation,  that  is  it.  We are  in  amode right now where the  economy is  incurring transition costs  all  thetime  in  both directions,  and I do  not  find that very  satisfactory.With  respect  to  the  second question--whether we  agree that  weare more  likely to  achieve credible price stability  if  we  set  specifictargets  for  inflation--I  think Al's  answer to  that is  right.  I do  notwant  to  get bogged down  in  technical  details.  I have  thought about1/31-2/1/95-48-the  issue  of  targets,  and  I would be  inclined to  set  them.  I thinkthat  if we  do  set  quantitative  targets--and we  could do  this  withrespect  to  a trend rate  of  inflation  so  we would not be  making a pointestimate  for  a given year  or  a relatively  short period of  time  butwould be  looking  at  a moving average  over  time--we  could set  targetsthat we would be  able  to  achieve  over a reasonable timeframe.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Excuse me, are you talking aboutinflation as  distinct  from the  price  level?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I think that  is  another issue.  There  are prosand cons  for  both of  them.  I don't  think it  is  productive to  get  intothat  today, but  if  we could continue  this discussion later,  that  isclearly one  of  the  issues we ought  to  have the  staff  look at  and weshould discuss  further.  With respect  to  this point,  clearly justannouncing that we have  set  targets would not  do much for  ourcredibility.  What  really  determines  credibility  in  the  long run ishow we perform.  I guess  I am saying  that making ourselves  accountablefor  something  that  is  quantifiable  is much more  likely to get  us  toprice  stability  than the  regime we have been  in.  We have been talkingabout price stability  for years,  but  we  are still  a long  distance awayas  far  as  I am concerned even  though I think  the  record of  the  FOMChas been quite  good.The  third point  I would make  relates  to  something you said aminute ago,  Mr. Chairman.  That  is,  there will  be  legislativeproposals  on this  and hearings will  be held.  I think it  is  incumbenton  us  to  get  ourselves  in  a position where we  can state  a meaningfulview as  a Committee  and try  to  influence  the  outcome.  It  is  quitepossible that,  regardless  of  what we  think  about  inflation  targeting,we will  get  legislation.  If we are  confused about what we want, wecould well  get  legislation that we  do not  like.  The  other  thing Iwould say  is  that  it  is  not clear  to me, and this  again  is  not  thetime  to  discuss  it,  that  the present  legislation  under which weoperate would absolutely preclude some  sort  of  inflation  targetingregime.  I think  there would be  some  advantage  to  go  along the  coursethat Al  described where as  soon  as  we  can reach some  sort  ofconsensus,  assuming that  there  is  some  consensus  in  this  direction, wecould move  ahead to  take  some actions  on our  own.  We  could have thestaff  look  at various  issues  and announce that we  are  considering  thismatter.  We might  indicate  that we would consider  this  issue andreport  on  it  in  connection with  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony atmidyear and that  we would be  thinking  in terms  of  setting  some  sort  ofprovisional  targets  down  the  road.  Obviously, various  questions  wouldhave to  be  evaluated before  those  would be  finalized.  My point  isthat  if  we acted  in a sense  independently  of  the  legislative  process,the  failure to  get  legislation would not necessarily preclude us  fromproceeding with something  that  I think makes  sense in  any case andpossibly could be  reconcilable with  some  of  the  other objectives  inthe  existing  legislation.  That  is  all  I have.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  May I suggest  that we  take  a break nowfor  a short  while.  We have coffee  out  there and we will  continue onwith President  Boehne.[Recess]

[SECTION]

MR.BOEHNE.  I come  out  somewhere  between President Broaddusand Governor Yellen.  Over  time,  the primary goal  for  a central  bankought  to be  price  stability, but we  do  not get  there  in  a  straightline.  Whether we like  it  or not,  in  the  real  world we  have  to  dealwith  short-term  issues  like  liquidity problems, weakness  in demand,recession, that  sort  of  thing.  The  important  thing is  that  when wedeal  with  these  short-run  issues,  we  try to do  it  as  best  we can  inthe  context  of  pursuing  our  longer-term  objectives.The  second point  is  that--while  I appreciate the  theoreticalarguments  that  if  we make  a commitment,  the  sacrifice ratio  is  less--in  the  real  world what matters  is  not  what people  say,  it  is  what  theydo.  We got  off  track in  the  late  '60s  and  '70s not with what  we  saidbut with what we  did.  We  got back on  track  in  the  '80s  and early'90s.  We did  this,  I think, not  so  much by worrying about  whetherinflation went  up a  tenth or  two  over  the  business cycle;  we did  it  ina  secular  context.  From cycle  to  cycle  inflation  rose  in  the  '60s  and'70s,  and  from cycle  to  cycle  inflation went  down in  the  '80s  and'90s.  I do  not  think there  is  enough political  support  for  thepursuit  of  a single  inflation goal without  regard to  short-runconsiderations.  If  we got  50  people  in  the  Congress  to  vote  for  that,I would be  surprised.  In  the  real world, we  have  to  deal  with  short-run  issues.My own  view is  that  we  ought  to  continue  largely  as  we havefor  the  last  fifteen or  so  years.  I think you best  expressed  thatview, Mr. Chairman,  in  one  of your very recent  testimonies,  but  Idon't  remember  the  quote  exactly.  It  went  something  like  this:  Thatwe  ought  to  aim  to  extend  and hopefully  improve  upon the  low inflationrecord.  I think we have  to  do  it  in  the  context  of  knowing  that  whenwe have  short-run  issues, we  can't  ignore  them.  We  are  going  to  haveto  deal with  them.  Just  as  we  have worked  inflation down  from doubledigit  rates,  I think we  can get  closer  to price  stability  over  time.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think that  the  recommendationsoutlined by Al  would be  very useful.  It  would be  useful,  I think,  forus  to  communicate to  the public  as  a goal  some  idea  of  a predictableaverage  level  of  inflation.  I also  believe we  could deal  with  short-run cyclical  issues  even within  the  context  that  Al  suggested.  Iwould  also say  that  as  one  looks  at  what  is  in  the  Greenbook  and theBluebook,  it  is  clear that  we  have  a rather  difficult period  ahead ofus,  and that  suggests  to  me  that  it  would be nice  to  have  someconsensus  about  these  issues  within  the  Committee, regardless  ofwhether we  go  to  the public.  Quite  frankly,  I am not  sure  how wewould approach  these  issues  that  are  covered  in  the  Greenbook and theBluebook over  the  longer  term without  some operating  consensus.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman, as  all  issues  go,  I  think botharguments have merit.  I believe a  couple of  things:  one,  for us  tochange  our emphasis,  there  needs  to  be  some kind  of  legislation, andthat  is  partly what  this  is  about.  Among  the alternative  approachesthat  have been discussed, I am  inclined  toward something  like  the Nealamendment because  I think that  price stability  is  a necessarycondition  for  long-term growth.  At  the  same  time,  I would not be1/31-2/1/95-50-strongly inclined toward a numerical  target, because  I think there  isa measurement problem with  that.  So,  I prefer the  language  in  theNeal  amendment  regarding  the  objective  of  price  stability.  I thinkthat having that would not  negate  our need to maintain balance, but  itwould give  us  an  emphasis  toward price  stability  that  is  necessary forlong-term growth.  It  also  would give us  the  important  discretion tohandle  shocks  or  to  allow for  events  to  take place which monetarypolicy can  address within a clear mandate  toward price stability  inthe  long  term that  in turn will  give us  a better  opportunity for  long-term growth.  That  is  how I would approach  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  My instinct  is  similar  to  that  of many others  inthat  I feel  it  would be a step  in  the  right direction  for us  to  adoptsome  sort  of  inflation  objective.  As  others have  already observed,inflation is  something  that  the profession and the Committee believewe can be held responsible  for  in  the  long  run.  It  is  related  tomonetary policy, and controlling it  may be  the most  importantcontribution we  can make  to  economic  performance  in the  long  run.Having  said that,  I would be  very careful  about  oversellingthis  at  this point on  a number  of  grounds.  One  that  already has beenreferred to  is  that,  without Congressional  support,  I don't know  thatour unilaterally doing this would buy us  very much credibility.Secondly,  I come  down on  the  side  that  ultimately we would need somesort  of numerical  objectives.  Otherwise,  it  is  not  clear  to  me howthe  proposal  differs very much  from what  we already are  doing.  Manyof  us  already have  spoken over  the  years in  favor of  some  kind  ofprice  stability objective,  recognizing  that  in  the  short  run we maypursue  other  objectives.  Thirdly, I don't  think  this  is  an objectivethat we  can adopt  or pursue  independently of  fiscal policy.  Do wereally believe that  if  fiscal  policy were  in  some  sense  exploding, wesimply would try  to pursue price stability?  I have real  reservationsabout  that.  Another  issue  is,  do we need a penalty?  If  we  fail  togain credibility, if  we  fail  to  achieve  the  objective,  does  there haveto be  some  sort  of  penalty, as  in New Zealand?  I am not  suggestingthat particular penalty!  [Laughter]  Without  that, what  do  we gain?I would  say the  real  sleeper  issue--I  touched on  this  earlierand Janet  raised  it  implicitly--is  that when push comes  to  shove,  I'mnot  sure  that we have  very good evidence  that  going in  this  directionreally makes  a lot  of  sense  from the  point of  view of  economic welfareas  opposed to,  for  example,  stabilizing  inflation  at  the  current  rate,if  that  is  a feasible  alternative.  We  talk as  if  we do  and we hopethat we  do,  but  the  analysis  that  I see  on that  subject  does not  leadme  to  be  very confident.  I think we  have  to  hold  ourselves  to  thehighest  standard on  that  issue  because  if  the  question is  put  to  us  inCongressional  testimony concerning what  benefits we  can  expect  interms  of  economic performance  from  taking  inflation down  from  3 to2-1/2  percent  or whatever over  the next  x years, we have  to beprepared to  address  that question  in a serious way.  It  is  a toughquestion.

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, it  seems  to  me  there are  twopotential ways  to  go here:  one  is  primarily quantitative  and the  other1/31-2/1/95-51-primarily qualitative.  I guess  there are  some hybrids.  I would bevery leery about  a predominantly or  entirely quantitative  approachbecause  I think  it  might very well  imply performance  that we  would notbe  able  to  deliver  or might  not  even want  to  deliver under  somecircumstances.  Either  of  those  developments would be  intenselycounterproductive  over  time.  In the  case  of  qualitative-type goals,it  is  hard  for me  to  see  how the  Fed  is  going  to  do  itself much goodor  to  cause much good by unilaterally stating  such a  goal.  I just  donot  see  that  as  being very helpful  to  our credibility.  For one  thing,every  one  of  us  has  repeatedly put  forward publicly our  commitment  toprice  level  stability.  There  should  not be any  question  in anybody'smind as  to  where every person at  this  table  stands  on  that  issue.  Ifwe  did announce quantitative  goals and  there  subsequently was  ashortfall,  it  would be  extremely counterproductive  even  if  theshortfall was  for a very good reason.  It would  impair  our credibilitytremendously.Now, if  we  are going  to  have  to  testify on  a specificproposal  in  the Congress--it used to  be  a Neal  proposal  and nowperhaps  it  will  be a Mack proposal--I  think we  are going  to  have  tolook at  it  quite  specifically.  If  it  is  too  soft,  it  will  besomewhere between useless  and worse.  If  it  is  too  rigid,  that  wouldprobably be  a mistake  also because there  has  to  be  some  allowance  overtime  for  shocks,  external  events  of  all  different  sorts.  Gary justmentioned the relationship between  fiscal policy and monetary policy.We all  agree  that  it  is  terribly difficult  to  fine-tune, perhapsimpossible.  I think we would have  to  look at  the  specific proposal  tosee  if  there  is  adequate  flexibility  in  it,  appropriate  timeframes,appropriate  social  welfare  goals,  and  so  forth and then  delve  into  thedetails.  We  are  just  going  to  have  to  see what  is proposed ratherthan try to  make  a broad general  statement today  or  sometime  in  thefuture.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman,  I think the  Yellen-Broaddusdebate was very useful  in setting up  the merits  of  both  sides  of  thisissue.  I think  inflation targeting has  a  lot  of  appeal.  The main waythat  it  appeals  to  me  is  that  it  would help us  to  focus  our policyover  the  long  term and give  us  a  longer-term focus  than  I believe wehave had until  now.  Our  focus has  been far  too  shortsighted, andinflation  targeting would help us  in  that  respect.  On  the  other hand,I don't think  that we  have  a mandate  for  inflation targeting.  Now, itwas  not clear  to me  when  I read  the materials  whether we were  talkingabout  an  inflation  target  that  would be  set  unilaterally by  theCommittee or  through  legislation.  I would have  very, very seriousquestions about  our  ability  legally  to  set  an  inflation target giventhe  Humphrey-Hawkins mandate.  On  the  other hand,  if we  are  talkingabout proposed  legislation and whether  to  support  it,  I still wouldraise  the  question  about whether  there  is  a social mandate  in  thecountry.  Any  inflation  target  to be  credible has  to be accompanied bywidespread agreement  that  it  is  indeed  our mandate.Gary Stern  hit on  another  aspect  of  this--the  question ofmild inflation.  I think everyone in  the  country agrees  that  if  we  hadinflation of  10,  12,  14  percent,  something would need to be  done  aboutit.  But  is  3 percent  inflation  so  harmful  to  the  economy  that  itneeds  to  be  reduced?  Just  announcing or  adopting an  inflation  target1/31-2/1/95-52-does  not  do  anything  for  our  credibility.  We had  the  same  experiencewith the  aggregates when  they were working.  Most of  the  time,  we werelowering those aggregates,  and  I don't  think that necessarily boughtus  a lot  of  credibility.  The  Bundesbank has  been mentioned a coupleof  times.  It  seems  to me  that  the  situation  in Germany  is  quitedifferent because  there  is  a very clear mandate on  the  part  of  theGerman people  to have  low  inflation.  As  Janet Yellen mentioned, aninflation  target  can backfire if  we  do not  use  it  judiciously.  Thebottom line  for me  is  that  I do  not believe  that  the  only  goal  for  acentral bank  is price  stability  or  low  inflation.  I believe  that  itis  the  primary objective  of  a central  bank but  that we have  othergoals  as  well.  As Governor Kelley  indicated, much depends  on  thestructure  of  the  legislation  that might  come  through;  we would have  tohave escape  clauses  and all  the  rest.  But  if  we  are  talking about  anexplicit target,  I would be very, very  leery of  that.  If  I were askedtoday  to  decide  this  issue,  I would say I would be against  aninflation  target and I would  associate myself entirely with  the viewsof Governor Yellen,  But  I do  think that  it  is  an  issue  that  needs  tobe explored  further.  We need to give  additional  thought  to  this,particularly in  light  of  the  legislative  language  that might  develop.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  As  usual,  let  me defend  the  status quo.  Wehave a dual  objective  in  the  Federal  Reserve  Act now.  I think itworks very well.  I think  the  case  that  it  is  broken  and needs  fixingis  extremely  thin.  Some  of  you may  remember that I defended theFederal  Reserve Act  at Jackson Hole,  thereby provoking a great  deal  ofcontroversy.  I have not  changed my views  on  that  one  iota.  Many ofthe  reasons were enunciated by Janet  Yellen.  But  the  fact  of  thematter  is:  there  is  a short-run  trade-off, and  it  does  matter topeople.  There is  no  existing evidence--and I can't  say this  toostrongly--that having  such  targets  leads  to  a superior  trade-off.None at  all.  It  is not one  of  those cases  in which the  evidence isequivocal.  There  is  nothing  that  can be  cited.  We  know that  theemployment costs  of  inflation  reduction are very  substantial.  Thereis  even  a reasonable consensus about  how to  measure  them.  Thebenefits  of moving, as  Gary Stern  said, from 3 to  2-1/2  percent  orlower  inflation are very hard to measure.  We would be hard pressed tocome up with anything convincing  that  led  to  a large number.  The  casefor  inflation-only targeting  comes  from  the  view  that  the  central  bankneeds more  discipline.  This  view, by  the  way, comes  out  of  academiawith  a lot  of baggage,  some of  which  I think is  pretty silly, havingbeen  in  that  world a very long  time.  The view is  that you have  tocontrol  these  central bankers  because  they do  not  know what  they aredoing, and you can't  trust  them to  be  true  to  the mandate  to  fightinflation!  I do  not  see  the behavior  of  the  Federal Reserve  over  timeas  fitting  that  charge.Next--this  is  very important  to me, but  it  is  not  something  Iever  thought about  before  I was  on  this  Committee--is  the  issue ofhonesty.  Many central banks  claim  to  have only a price  stabilitymandate or  objective;  none  of  them acts  that way.  I would not  likethe  Federal  Reserve to  be  in  that position.  The  Bundesbank wasmentioned, but  the  Bundesbank does  not  act  that way.  If  it  did, youcould ask yourself why it  lowered  interest  rates  for  two years whileinflation was  still  3 to  4 percent.  They were not  at price stability;they said  they were not  happy with the  inflation rate  at  that  time;1/31-2/1/95-53-and yet  they were  lowering  interest rates.  You do  not  fight  inflationby  lowering interest  rates--not the  last  time  I checked!  Like JanetYellen,  I do not  think being  fundamentally dishonest  in  this  waybreeds credibility.  The  alternative  is  to  be  fundamentally honest  andreally do what our  legislative mandate  says.We  do  not have  a Mack proposal,  so  I think I have  to  agreewith Mike  Kelley  that we can't  be  against  it  until  we  see  it.  I reada short  colloquy between our  Chairman and Senator Mack in  theCongressional Record  in which the  senator  clearly  says his  objectiveis  to  take  away from  the  Fed any concern with short-run employment.That  is what  he wants  to  do.  If we  had such a directive  fromCongress,  we could either refuse to  do what  Congress  told us,  which Ido  not  think  is  a very good  idea, or we  could in  fact  ignore  theemployment objective, which I am guessing will  be  the  intent  ofSenator Mack's proposal,  if  there  is  indeed a proposal.  That  is  not  achoice  I would like  to  have.  If  the proposal  is  going to  be anythinglike what we  think  it  is  going  to  be,  I would certainly urge  that  theFederal Reserve  oppose it  in  testimony.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I think we  have  just proved the  anti-economistadage  that,  if  we  lay all  the  economists  in  the world end  to  end, wewill  not  reach a conclusion.  I will  at  least  try to  touch  both ends.At  the  last meeting  I was  looking for  a bridge  to  both sides  of  theriver;  I will  continue  that  analogy.  I thank you  for raising  the  Mackmeasure because  I think  it  focuses our discussion.The  first  point  I would make  is  that  if  it  comes  down  to achoice between  Humphrey-Hawkins  and a Senator Mack proposal,  I thinkthe  right  way to  do  the Mack proposal  is  to  see  it  as  a way  to  changeHumphrey-Hawkins.  Governor Blinder probably incorrectly characterizedHumphrey-Hawkins as  giving us  a dual objective;  it  does not.  It  givesus  seventeen, eighteen--heaven knows how many;  there is  a paragraph ofobjectives.  That  is  not a good directive  for  the  Federal Reserve.  Ithink  I can say  that  few of  us would select  Humphrey-Hawkins if wewere drafting  this  kind of  legislation.  The gain here is  that we  areopening a door  that  we should use as  a vehicle  for  change.Second,  I view as  very well  taken Janet Yellen's point thatwe  should not  oversell  and  should not underestimate  the  costs  of  aMack proposal.  We need  to  be honest,  and I do not  think  there  is  anydisagreement on  that  at  this  table.  The Mack legislation would becostly.  Third, I think if  we look at  the  loss  function,  or  the  otherside of  the  loss  function which is  a gain  function, we  find  thatpoliticians  are well  aware of  the  gain  function.  The  reason we havefourteen-year terms  is  the  recognition that  politicans are well  awareof  the  gain  function  and want  to  exploit  it.  They exploited  it  asrecently as  the  late  1970s,  and we  had a very painful  disinflation topay for  it.  If  there  was an  advantage  to  changing the  law towardfocusing on price  stability, it  would not necessarily be to  change ourbehavior but as  a recognition  of  this political  disequilibrium.  Ithink that  is  a real plus  in passing  something  like  that.Fourth, one  of  the  things we  all  taught  in  economics  wasthat,  if  we have  one  instrument, we  can only work with  one  target.  Idon't  think it  necessarily  follows  that  the  target  should be price1/31-2/1/95-54-inflation.  I think it  should be  nominal  GDP, and I believe  that  issomewhat  in  line with-what  Governor Yellen  said.  But  once  we picknominal  GDP as  our objective  function,  it  begs  a second question thathas  to be answered.  It  is  that  a nominal  GDP target probably has  tobe  consistent with  some desired  level  of  inflation.  So,  having  thisprocess  and having Congress  tell  us  some  desired level  of  inflation,  Ithink is  probably good.  But our  target  should not  be  the  desiredlevel  of  inflation;  our  target  should be nominal  GDP.  You disagree?Well,  not wildly!  [Laughter]The  final  part of  whatever Congressional  testimony we have onthis  subject  is  that  the  real  focus  of  Congressional  action  should notbe  to  tell us  what  the  inflation  rate should be,  although that wouldbe useful.  It  should be  on  the  policy actions  they control  thataffect  the nonaccelerating rate  of  inflation.  I do  not  think  it  isgiven to  us  by God;  I do not  think it  is  etched  in  stone;  I think itis  given to  us  by the  Congress.  I think that  higher  real minimumwages  raise  the NAIRU and lower real  minimum wages  lower  the NAIRU.We  can go  through  a whole  list  of  other  things.  So  the  right way toimprove  the  loss  function  or gain  function  is  not  in  this  room;  it  isup  there  on Capitol  Hill.  Maybe part  of  our  objective  should be  toremind them of  that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Although the Humphrey-Hawkins  Actis  in  fact full  of  goals  I reduce  them, as  I think Governor Blinderdid,  to two  that  I describe  as  sustained economic  growth and pricestability.  But  I find  that  to  be  really a single goal,  since  I amabsolutely convinced that  the best way to  achieve  sustained  economicgrowth  is  through price  stability.  I prefer  to  state  the  objective  ofprice  stability in words  rather  than as  a numerical  goal.  I believethat  in achieving  our goal  of price  stability, we  should  seek adownward secular path  in inflation  from business cycle  to  businesscycle.  That  goal means  somewhat more  disinflation because  I dobelieve that  the  present  level  of  inflation  at,  say,  2-1/2  to 3percent  is higher  than  one wishes  to have  for  either  economic orsocial reasons.I question  the whole  idea  of  credibility.  Nobody has  beenable  to prove  that credibility has bought  the  Bundesbank or any othercentral bank  the  benefit  of  a lower  cost  to reduce  inflation.  Infact,  Stanley Fischer presented a very good paper at  the  300thanniversary of  the  Bank of  England proving  rather the  contrary.  Thereis  no particular benefit  in  the  so-called credibility, and I thinkcredibility mainly makes  central  bankers  feel better  about  themselves.It  seems  to  me  that  the  record of  this  Committee  over recent years  hasbeen as  good, if  not better,  than  any central  bank I can  think of,including  specifically the  Bundesbank.  I think  it  would be veryunconvincing as  a public policy goal  for us  to  position ourselves  asdriving toward some number  for  inflation, which presumably if  onecould figure  out how to measure  it  accurately would be  zero,  where weknow the  costs  of  achieving it  would be very high and we  are very,very uncertain  of  the benefits.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.1/31-2/1/95-55-

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  We  all  come  at  this  in  slightly differentways.  I do  think it  is  important  for any  government entity  or quasi-government  entity, however we  are  classified,  to  communicate  its  long-term goals--which  are not  unlike  a mission  statement  that any  kind ofentity would have.  Inflation  is  probably the  area  where we  have  themost  control  in  the  long  run.  I do not  think  that we  have  as  muchcontrol  in  the  area  of  employment  in  the  long run,  given  fiscal policyand other effects.  It  seems  important  to  me  for  us  to  state  clearlythat  our  long-run  goal  is  to  control  inflation.  Now, I certainlyrecognize, and  I think Ed Boehne stated very  clearly, that we  operatein  the  real world and we have  to  take  into account  certain  short-runissues,  be  they business  cycle  issues  or  liquidity  issues, whatever.But  it  seems  to me  that  if  we make monetary policy decisions  in  thecontext of  a long-term goal  that we  are  then  still  being true  to  ourmission.If  I look back at  the period when we were  easing,  one of  thethings  that  I looked  at,  and I think  a lot  of people  around  the  tablelooked at, was  the kind of  progress  we were making  on  inflation.  Evenwhile we were  easing, we were  still  looking at  the  fundamentals  ofprice movements  to  see whether or  not we would be  doing  some kind  ofdamage to  our ultimate  objective  of  price stability.  I come down  onthe  importance of  expressing clearly that  control of  inflation is  ourmajor goal.  It  is  clear  that we do  not have  it  as  a mandate  now.  So,what  do we  do  in  the  interim?  Even  in  the  existing  Humphrey-Hawkinsreports,  I think  we  could start  to  be  more explicit  about  looking atperhaps  a range  of  inflation measures.  We  could  look at  it  as  amonitoring goal  somewhat  like  the way we look  at  the monetaryaggregates.  Obviously, the  Congress  ultimately is  going  to  havesomething  to  say about  it,  but  it  seems  to me  that  if  we  take  theinitiative  to  start working  in  this  area, we would be more  in  thedriver's  seat  than simply reacting to  a piece  of  legislation thatcomes  forward.  Unless we  have  a specific proposal  before us,  itcertainly  is  difficult  to  say, yes,  I would be  for  this  or  againstthat.  But as  a general matter,  I think that  it  would be  important  forus  to  communicate  that we want  to  control  inflation,  with pricestability  as  our  long-term goal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mr.  Chairman,  the proposal  for  a balanced budgetamendment  implies  to  me  an  abject  admission  of  total  lack  of  selfdiscipline  on  the part  of  the  Congress.  I do not  think we need tomake that  kind of  admission  about our  pursuit  of  the  goal  of  stableprices.  If  we  set  a target, we  do not  get  any credit  for hitting itfrom three  feet  away;  we have  to  hit  it  from a hundred yards  away.  Itseems  to  me that  not being able  to  achieve  the  goal  that we  set upthen makes  us  subject  to  an enormous  amount of  criticism  that  is  quitejustified because we  said  we  can do  this but  then  fail  to  do  so.  I donot  see how we  can commit  to  that  kind of  objective  as  long as  fiscalpolicy  over which we  have no  control  is  out  there  and can be  the  loosecannon on  the deck  or  the wild card  in  the  inflation wager.  Irecognize  that  Humphrey-Hawkins makes  the  monetary policy mission ofthe  Federal Reserve  a little more difficult  because  it  is  a three-legged stool  on which  it  is  not very easy to  keep  the  seating.  But  Ido not  think it  is  inconsistent with pursuit of  a policy of  stableprices.  That  is  demonstrated by the  progress that  has been made  inreducing the  level  of  inflation over  time.  I am much more  in  sympathy1/31-2/1/95-56-with Governor Yellen's analysis  and conclusions  than the  rigidity thatis  implied by what Al  has  proposed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman, I am from  the  "if  it  ain't broke,don't  fix  it"  school.  It  is  not  that  the  Humphrey-Hawkins bill  is  theideal  piece  of  legislation, which  it  clearly  is not,  but  I think asGovernor LaWare  said, this  FOMC has  implemented it  extremely well.Our record  is  good, and  I think that  opening  it up now and trying  tomake  changes  in  it  may raise other problems  that we do  not  want  to  getinto.  If  we are  to  have  any  type of  targeting or  numbers  or  evenranges,  that  should require  legislation.  The  reason  I say that  isthat  for  targeting  to  be  successful  it  clearly would require  theefforts  of  the  legislative branch,  the  executive branch,  and  of  courseour own efforts.  Looking at  the experience  of  other countries  thatwas  reported in  the  staff  paper,  for  those that  had targets,  I couldsee  that  in  every case  the  central  bank was doing it  jointly with thefinance ministry.  Therefore, the  executive branch was  clearly tiedinto  it;  it was  not  the  central bank doing  it  alone.  In  most  of  thosecountries,  the central bank  is  independent.  I think  it  clearly has  tobe a government-wide  effort  to  do  this;  it  just  can't be  the  centralbank alone  for  reasons  that  others  have mentioned here.On a numerical  target,  I would be  concerned  if  we announced anumerical  target  for  inflation  that  we  just would not  gain  that muchand also  it would  limit  our  flexibility.  When  thinking about  this  intalking  to  our  staff,  I came  to  the  same conclusion  that  Larry Lindseycame  to,  namely, that  we  should  choose nominal GDP  as  the  target  togive us  more flexibility.  But  there  are some problems with nominalGDP,  too.  I think we would still  have the  escape hatch  issue,although it  may not be  as  severe as  just  choosing an  inflation target.If  we have  a nominal GDP target, we  still have  to have  a long-terminflation  target within the  nominal GDP.  Even  then,  there could besome  cases where we probably would go  beyond  the nominal  GDP targetand we would have  to  lay those  out  in advance.  If  we  lay  them out  inadvance,  that  affects  our  credibility.  Would people  really believethis?  Clearly, nominal  GDP would be much better  than  a long-terminflation  target  alone,  if  we  are going to  go  that  route.  I alsothought  the paper  was  interesting  in noting  that  in  the  New Zealandcase, when they started  to  bump up  against  the  inflation target,  theysuggested redefining measured inflation  to  exclude  some  things  thataffect prices.I guess my conclusion  is  that  we should not make any changesunless  they are necessary.  If  we have  to  respond  to  some  legislationthat  is  on  the  table,  then  I think we  should at  least  seek somealternatives.  We  should have  this  fleshed out  a little more by  thestaff,  and look at  some  options and alternative  ways  to  respondspecifically to  that  legislative proposal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  On  the  narrow question of  how to  respond ortestify on  a Connie Mack bill,  we need to  be in  a position  to supportthe  idea  that price  stability  is  our primary long-term goal.  I wouldhate  to  see  us  in  a position of  having them offering it  and usrejecting  it.  I agree with Ed  Boehne  that  it  is  highly unlikely that1/31-2/1/95-57-Congress  will  actually go  through with it  and give  it  to  us.  I dothink that  we  have  a pretty good thing going right  now.  Our  story isthat price  stability  is  our  long-term primary goal  but not  our onlygoal.  It  contributes  to  the  other goal,  which  is  high output  andemployment.  Humphrey-Hawkins  is  written with multiple goals.  Thereis  a paragraph  full  of  them.  However,  in  the public mind and I thinkin Congress'  mind, there  really are  only  two goals:  price  stabilityand  employment growth.  We pretty well  have  finessed  that  issue,  as  wehave it  right  now.  Ed mentioned that  in the  1970s,  inflationratcheted up with each cycle and  that  in the  1980s  and early  1990s  ithas  ratcheted down  in each  cycle.  It  seems  to  me  that we are  now justone  cycle  away from price  stability under current  arrangements.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Listening  to  this  is  really quiteinteresting.  We now understand why this  Committee has  had difficultyconfronting  this  issue.  It  is  because we  are as  split  down  the middleas  we could possibly get.  I wonder, however, how much of  thedifference  is  real  and how much  is  imagined.  The  reason I put  it  thatway is  that  I ask myself periodically what  range  of  actions do  we haveavailable  to  us,  and how does  that  compare  to an  earlier period?  Whatstrikes  me  about where we are  is  that  even  though the Federal  Reserveis  an  independent institution  in  the  legal  sense,  meaning that  ourwe are  in  fact  very dependent  on  the  culture and  the philosophy  of  thesociety  in which we  function.  It  is  a subliminal  issue  and one needsonly to  have  been exposed to  it  for a long  time  to  realize what  thedifferences  are.When  I first  got  into  goverment  in  1974,  inflation was  justbeginning  to  take hold  as  a big issue.  For  the  first  time--I  think itgenerally agreed among  the  G-7  that  inflation was  the  cause  ofunemployment.  Now, this was  an  extraordinarily unusual  thought  thatwas  not present  in earlier years.  One could see  the  changes  that  werebeginning to  emerge.  I remember Arthur  Burns, with whom I used tovisit  quite often and whom  I had known since  graduate  school,  wouldspeak against inflation  like  none  of  us  here  is  used to  hearing.  Ifone  looks  at  what  the  Federal Reserve did in  that period, that  anti-inflation  attitude  is  scarcely  to  be  seen in  the policy  or  in  thenumbers or  in anything.  Then  I ask myself, how is  that  possible?Here  was a stalwart  inflation hawk and look  at  the  record.  The  answeris  that he  had to  deal  with an  environment  in which the  philosophy wasstill partially  held over  from  the  fifties  and the  sixties when, for  awhile,  there was  a notion held very broadly that  a modest amount  ofinflation was  good, not bad.  The  issue of  price  stability was  neveran  issue  that  was presumed  to  have  the  importance  that  it  subsequentlyhas  acquired  in our era.  There  is  no  one  today among the  535  membersof  the  Congress who would say that  inflation is  a good thing.  Thirtyyears  ago  that  number would have  been a minority, but  I would  submitto  you that  it  would not have been  zero.There has been  a fundamental  change,  and I think it  is  theresult of  the  extraordinarily negative experience we all  had in  thelate  1970s.  That  is,  the culture  changed very dramatically in  the1980s,  and what we have now is  a basic view that inflation matters.In the  debates  that we have on  the  Hill--Humphrey-Hawkins  and thelike--there is  never a question of  whether we  should accept  a littleinflation for  some decrease  in  unemployment;  that usually was  the1/31-2/1/95-58-relevant  discussion twenty years  ago.  The  discussion now centersaround  the  assertion that  there is  no  inflation  and  that  monetarypolicy is  too  tight.This  really raises  some very interesting  questions  as  towhere we are.  My own  impression  is  that  even  if we  now locked intolaw a fixed inflation  rate--say, 2 percent  or  1 percent--and theCongress  voted for  it  with  a large majority,  in  the  first  recessioneveryone would be  arguing  to  go  in  a different  direction.  I am notcertain that  there  is  enough knowledge  in  the Congress  about what  thetrue  trade-offs  are  to get  useful,  informed opinions  because  we aredealing with people who generally are not  economists  and have not beeninvolved in some  of  the  monetarist or  other policy  subtleties withwhich we deal.  I would not even  take  as  a given,  if  the  Congress gaveus  authority  to  have an  explicit  goal,  that we  really would be  able  toadhere  to  it  and say  the  reason  that we are  raising rates now when  theunemployment rate  is  going up 2 points  a month is  that  we are worriedthat  we won't  meet our  inflation  goals.  I will  tell you  that  if  wecould get 80  percent of  the Congress  to  vote  for  that  goal,  95  percentwould take a different  position when the world changes.My own view is  that a general  long-term view of  pricestability  of  the  Neal  form  is  a very useful  conceptual  anchor  for usto  do basically what we have  been  doing.  This  is  essentially, as  BobMcTeer  mentioned just  a moment  ago,  that  we are  sort  of  one  cycle  awayfrom being there.  But  the  problem is  that  we do  not  go  in  a straightline,  to  the  extent  that we  are  even focusing on  it.  You may recallthat a couple  of  years  ago, we  all  basically said we were  going tohave  to move  early on  the up  side  or we would not  achieve  anythingresembling price stability.  Now, I submit  to you that  is  exactly whatwe did.  We did follow a price stability objective  in  a cyclicalsense,  that  is,  one where  the  inflation  rate  is  going to  be  lower ateach progressive cyclical  peak and  lower at  each progressive  cyclicallow.  But that  objective  is  not  being implemented  in  a straight  linebecause we  have  recognized, and I think correctly,  that  the  Congresswould not give  us  a mandate  to  do  that.If  we got  legislation  in  the  form of,  say,  something  like  theNeal  bill  or  a considerably watered  down version  of  the  earlier Mackproposal,  it  probably would be  useful  for us  because  it  would give  usa particular goal.  But  if we  tried  to  implement  it  in  an  explicitform independently of  where we were  in  the  business cycle, mysuspicion  is  that we would find  that  all  that  support would  justevaporate.  I would not  say  the  current policy  is  the  best we  can do.I hope  that  this  Committee would subscribe,  as  I believe  it  doessubscribe,  to  the  ultimate goal  that  low  inflation/price  stability iswhere we would like  to  be,  other  things  equal.  What  we would notstate  as  a goal  is  that we would  like  the unemployment rate  to  be 5percent,  independent  of  everything else  that  is  going on.  I think weought  to have  an  inflation  goal  that  is  qualitative, as  Al Broaddussays,  one  that  is  defined in  operational  terms, not  in  terms  ofnumerical  targets.  We would  always be moving  in  the  direction  ofprice stability, recognizing  that we would not  do  so  in  a straightline because I do  not  think we  have  the  philosophical, cultural,  orpolitical  support  in  this  society  for  that.  There  still  is  a short-term Phillips  curve.  People respond  to  it;  they  are  aware of  thesetrade-offs,  and  to  deny  them,  I think,  is  a misunderstanding  of  howour  political  system works.  If  we do  have  to  testify on  a Mack bill,1/31-2/1/95-59-which I think we will, we have  to  support or  should support  the  viewthat  low inflation  or price stability  is  very valuable to  have as  along-term goal.  Until we  see  the  actual  bill  circulated among  themembers  and they  are polled individually,  I am not  sure,  justrecording what  everybody  said, that we would find  a way of  breakingwhat  looks  to me  like  a "on the one  hand or on  the  other  hand"situation;  basically, what we have is  two-handed FOMC members.That  is  all  I have  to  say.  Does  anybody else want  to  raiseany questions?  I may have  ended up being last.  Why don't  we wait  tosee  what  type  of  legislation we can get?  I think  it  will be a veryimportant piece of  legislation  for us.  Rather than  try  to  develop  aposition  in advance,  I would suggest  that we wait  and see  what  theactual  legislation is  and try  to get  a consensus  for our  response ifwe  can  find one  in this  group.The  last  item  for  today  is  a report by Ted Truman ondevelopments  in  Mexico in  the last  48  hours  or  so.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I am sure you haveheard more  than you would  like  about  Mexico's situation  in the  lastfew  days and weeks.  Nevertheless,  I thought  it  would be  useful  tosummarize the  state  of  play with regard to  the Mexican  situation as  ofthis afternoon.  I will  touch on  five  topics:  first,  the nowapparently dead  legislation  in  the U.S.  Congress;  second,  the  totalU.S.  plan to  deal  with the  Mexican crisis  that  would be  aided bycertain  FOMC actions;  third, the  IMF program;  fourth,  efforts  tomobilize other  forms  of multilateral  support;  and  finally,  the  Bank ofMexico's request  to  make a further drawing on  the  existing  FederalReserve/ESF  swap  lines.  We need  a sense  of whether the  Committee  isinclined to  approve the  increase  in  the  swap line.First,  I can be very brief  on  the now apparently deadlegislation that  would have provided up  to  $40  billion  in U.S.government  guarantees  of  Mexican government  securities,  The prospectsfor passage  of  that  legislation have  gone  steadily downhill  since  itwas  announced almost  three weeks  ago.  Decisions  were made  last  nightand  this morning by the  President and  the  bipartisan leadership  tostop pushing  for  the  legislation.  I think it  is  fair  to  say that thefuture  of  the  legislation  is nonexistent,  but  I won't belabor  thepoint.Turning to  where we  are now, before  I say anything more,  Iwould note  that  I am acutely aware of  the  strongly held view on  thisCommittee that  the  central bank should not be  expected to  underwriteforeign or  other debt  issues,  in  large part because  covering such debtobligations would  involve the  inappropriate use  of  central bank  funds.That  being said,  the U.S.  authorities  faced two broad alternatives  asit  became clear  that  the  legislation would not pass.  We  couldconclude  that  we had  tried and failed in what  the Chairman has  calledthe  "least worse" approach, which was  to  leave Mexico  to  fend  foritself.  Alternatively, we could  try to  help by using an approach  thatis  feasible but worse.

MR. LINDSEY.  Ted,  I'm sorry, we  are  having  trouble hearing.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Please  speak up  a little.1/31-2/1/95-60-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  In  the  end, the  second alternative was  chosen.The materials that were  distributed  to  you contain several  items.  Thefirst  page  is  a statement by the  President  and the Congressionalleadership.  Despite the  note  on  top, which  is  barely legible  but  saysthat  the  new financing package  is  on  hold and has  not yet  beencleared, the package has now been cleared.  Attached to  that  is  asummary of  the  currently proposed program, and behind that you willfind  President  Clinton's  speech this morning  to  the  National GovernorsAssociation in which he announced this  change  of  strategy.  The  lastitem is  the  announcement by  the Managing Director of  the  IMF  thismorning regarding the Mexican  situation and  the proposed IMF  package.The new approach would basically  involve the  heavy use  of  ESFlending  to Mexico  in  the  form  of  short-term swaps, medium-term swaps,and possibly loans  and guarantees  of Mexican  government  securities.The  latter  two  types  of  operations  apparently are legal  for  the  ESFbut  apparently also would  set  a precedent.  The  total  could be up  to$20  billion.  To  provide  the  ESF with the  necessary dollar  liquidityto  undertake these  operations,  the  Federal  Reserve would be asked toagree  to warehouse foreign currencies now held  in the  ESF, at present$19-1/2  billion  in holdings  of  DM and yen.  The  reason  is  that  theliquid dollar  assets on  the  ESF's balance sheet  are only about  $5billion.  In  addition,  the  Federal  Reserve has  been asked  toparticipate directly as  well.  The  form, consistent with precedent  andwith what  I said  earlier about  the  role  of  a central  bank in  suchcircumstances,  would be  for  the  Committee  to  agree  to  increase  itsswap  line  somewhat as  part  of  this  operation.  However,  there would bea  "take-out" in  the  form of  a commitment  from  the  Treasury that  theESF would take  over  any System obligation  that was  outstanding  formore  than  12  months.  We are not  going to  make a formal  recommendationto  the  Committee  for  action on  a specific  proposal today.  However, anincrease  in our Mexican  swap  line  to  $6 billion would,  in my opinion,be  reasonable  as  long as  we  get the  take-out.  I also  think  the  limiton  the warehousing of  foreign currencies  for  the  ESF  should be raisedto  $20  billion with the  understanding that  the  special  increase  islinked to  the Mexican situation.  I should also  say  that  a furtherunderstanding  could be  that we have  a situation  that  could last  for aslong as  ten years.  The Committee  may want  to  discuss  thesesuggestions  today  and vote  on  them tomorrow.The  third topic  is  the  IMF  program.  Last  Thursday, theMexican  authorities  announced agreement  with  IMF management  on  aneconomic program  in  support of  Mexico's  stabilization efforts.  Theprogram is  scheduled to  be  considered by the  IMF  Executive Board onWednesday with the  first  disbursement by Friday, assuming the  programis  approved.  The program  as  first proposed was  unprecedented in  itssize,  both absolutely and relative to Mexico's  quota  at  the  IMF.  Itwas  three  times  Mexico's  quota, or  about  $7.7  billion,  of  which  $3.9billion was  to  be  released on  approval  of  the program.  The  economiccontent  of  the program  is  tighter than  that proposed by the Mexicanauthorities  on January 3rd  in  terms  of  its  fiscal policy parametersand  especially its monetary policy parameters.  On the  surface  theprogram  is  designed to  achieve  the  same macroeconomic  objectives:  Interms  of growth,  as  you will  recall,  the  Mexican program  called forgrowth of  1-1/2 percent  year  over year;  inflation  in  the  Mexicanprogram was  set  at  19  percent December over  December;  the  exchangerate was  to get back  to  4.5 pesos per dollar;  and  the  current  accountbalance was  to  be  cut  to  a deficit  of  $14  billion  this year.  However,1/31-2/1/95-61-implicit  in the  program is  the  notion  that  some,  and probably all,  ofthese  objectives  will  have  to  be  revised and that  the  terms  orcontingency arrangements  of  the  program will need  to  be  furthertightened as  well.Following the  collapse  of the  U.S.  legislative proposal,  theManaging Director of  the  IMF decided  this  morning to  make  two  changesto  his  recommendations  tomorrow with respect  to  the program.  Thefirst  is  to  increase  the  size of  the program by  $10  billion, which hehopes  to  finance  from  non-BIS-member central banks.  There  is  somequestion about  that point,  and  if  the  funding is  not  obtained fromthose  central banks  and governments,  then  it would  come  from the IMF'sown resources.  Second, he  would have the  IMF disburse  the  full  amountof  the  original program  immediately.On my fourth  topic,  other multilateral  efforts,  theextraordinary size  of  the  IMF's  original program can be  explained bytwo  factors.  The  first  is  a recognition by  IMF management of  theserious  threat  to  the  international  financial  system posed by  theMexican situation.  The  second is  a recognition of  the need,especially as perceived by  the  United States  Congress,  for  greaterinternational  "burden-sharing,"  as  they  call  it,  in  efforts  tostabilize Mexican  financial markets.With respect  to  burden-sharing, we and  the Treasury have beendiscussing  certain proposals  with our  central bank colleagues.  Thefirst  is  to  enlarge  from $5 billion  to  $10  billion the  BIS  facility infavor  of Mexico  that was  agreed upon in  principle  on  December 30th.The  second  is  to  make  the  financing  from  the BIS  readily available  tomeet  current  short-term financing needs.  On  the  first point,  the  BISagreed that  the  increase,  in  principle, could be  announced as  part  ofthe  package  that  was  unveiled this  morning, although you will  notethat  some of  the  language of  the  subsequent  announcements  suggestsmore agreement than  actually exists, as  is  almost  always  the case.We are  less  optimistic  about  agreement  on  the  second point.The  Treasury, with our  technical  support,  also  has approachedthree groups  of other  countries  to ask  them  to  assist Mexico.  Youprobably have heard that a group  of  Latin American countries--Argentina, Brazil,  Chile,  and Colombia--generally has  respondedfavorably, although  the  modalities for  the  assistance are  not yetagreed upon.  In  addition,  the  Treasury has  approached a group ofcountries  in  the  Far East  and another group  of  countries  in  the  MiddleEast  for participation.  I suspect these  efforts will  now be  rolledinto the  IMF  endeavor  to  raise  an additional  $10  billion  to  financethe Mexican  program through the  Fund.Last,  as  you know, the  Bank of  Mexico so  far  has drawn $1billion  on  the  $10  billion Canadian and  joint  Fed/ESF swap  facility.Those drawings have  been made available  to  the  Bank of  Mexico  ratherthan being locked up at  the  Federal Reserve  Bank of  New York.  Weunderstand that as  of  the  end of  the day, Mexican reserves will bebetween $2.4  and $2.9  billion  including  those  drawings.  There is  someuncertainty about  how much they  lost  today, whether it  was  $1 billionor  $650  million.  And  then Mexico  intends  to  announce  the  level  of  itsreserves  tomorrow.  Governor Mancera has made  an urgent  request  thatwe  allow a further drawing  to  enable him to  pad his  reserves  somewhat.After  consultation with the Treasury, the  Chairman has  suggested that1/31-2/1/95-62-we allow the Bank of  Mexico to  draw an  additional  $2 billion,  $1billion on  each  swap  line,  with  the understanding  that  this  entireamount  would be  locked up  at  the Federal  Reserve Bank of  New York andnot  immediately available  for  use by  the  Bank of  Mexico.  On  thatsomber  note  I will  stop  and would be pleased to  answer  any questions.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Ted, what  is  the  status  of  the  collateralarrangements  that you  discussed on  the  conference  call  we had  sometime  ago?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  security arrangements with respect  to  theexisting enlarged  swap  arrangement  are all  in place.  Under  this  newproposal,  they would remain  in place behind  the  ESF's  operationsbecause  the  ESF would be  committed  to  taking us  out  first.  So  thisarrangement would be behind ours  as  well--any money would go  to usfirst.  Those  are  essentially the  same  arrangments  as  those  that havebeen widely talked  about  in  connection with  the guaranteesarrangement.  "Collateral" is  the word that  I fight  against  a lot,  Mr.Chairman.  I have had  too much  feuding with  the lawyers  on  this  point.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  What  are  the  security  arrangements?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They are  an  "assured means  of  repayment."  Theway  they work  is  that  the  non-Mexican customers  receive  irrevocableinstructions  from  the  Mexican government  as  of  a  specified  date,  adate which would be  after  a payment  was  due  on  the  guaranteed bonds  orwhatever  debt  instrument we are  talking  about,  to make  their oilpayments  to  a bank  in  the  United States,  an  account  of  Pemex  in thebank  in  the United  States.  Those  receipts would be  immediately paidinto  the  government  account and  from  the  government  account  into  aBank of  Mexico  account  at  the  Federal  Reserve Bank  of  New York.  Byprior  agreement,  though  that  is  not  required but  useful,  the Mexicanswould then acknowledge  that  the Federal  Reserve  Bank of  New York wouldhave the  right  to  set  off  funds  in  that  account  against  claims  of  theUnited  States  government  that  had been  assigned by  the  United Statesgovernment  to  the  Federal  Reserve.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  What would that  support?  In a  one-month periodof  time, what  would those  receipts be?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I  think it  is  about  $6  or  $7 billion a year,  soit  is  about  $500  million  a month.  The Chairman  has pointed out  thatthis  is  a mechanism that would allow repayment.  It  is  also  fair  tosay that  if  there were  circumstances where  the  repayment  wasdifficult,  it  might  be difficult  to  fully  enforce  the mechanism.  ButI think the  most  likely scenario  would be  that a  subsequent  agreementwould be  made.  It  may be good  in  this  circumstance  that  the  agreementwould be  between the Mexican  government  and  our government;  we wouldbe  the  agent,  but  we would be  left  out  of  it.  The  subsequentagreement  in  effect would say:  Because  of  other disasters  that  havehappened with Mexico, rather  than  taking all  your  oil  receipts wewould  take a more practical  amount--not  $6 billion  a year but  $2billion a year.  So,  rather  than paying off  $20  billion  over  3+ years,they would pay it  off  over  10  years.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  What  ability do  the Treasury or  the  ESF  have  totake us  out  of  an  obligation  if  funds  are not  appropriated by1/31-2/1/95-63-Congress?  Do  they have  the ability just  to  say, we committed  to  thisand we  are going  to  pay the Fed  off?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes,  they  could.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  But if  they can do  that,  why can't  they justadvance  it  themselves?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They  could, but  I think they feel  that  it  wouldbe useful to  their  objectives  to  have a lot  of people--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can I just  suggest where the  funds  comefrom?  How about a credit against  our payment  to  the  Treasury?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Why do  we  come before other  creditors  to  theTreasury--I  guess  that  is  another way of  stating  the  question--withregard to  any  funds?  In  other words, why do  we come  in  front  ofSocial Security recipients?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We would come  in front  of  the  ExchangeStabilization Fund, not  the  Treasury.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  the  Exchange  Stabilization  Fund.The point,  you know,  is  that  this  is  not  an  either/or  situation.  Forexample,  the  Treasury can validly pay us  off  with a note.  Treasuryobligations  are  on our  balance  sheet  right  now.  If  they took us  outwith a special  Treasury security, we would put  it  on  our balancesheet.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  There are  two  issues  about whether we aredealing with the  Treasury itself  or with  the  ESF.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me put  it  this  way:  If  the ESFloses  its whole balance sheet,  we have more problems  than we  know!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  80  percent  of  their balance sheet  is  goingto be pesos!

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The Treasury is  very  conscious of  the  fact  thatif  they make  this  arrangement--that  is  the  reason for  the warehousingof  up  to  $20  billion--they would need to  allow for  the  fact  that wehad advanced  $4, $5, or  $6 billion.  Therefore, we would have  to  havea contingent  claim on  them  for  that  $6 billion--if  that's  the  amount--12  months  down  the  line.  They would have  to  be able  to  take thatclaim over,  if necessary,  either  by advancing  their own  swap or by anarrangement with the Mexicans  under  this  program whereby the Mexicanswould use  their proceeds  to  pay us  off.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Could I just  formally respond  toGovernor Lindsey?  There  is  a question here  of  whether or not  theamount  the United States  Treasury gives  us  has to  be  appropriatedfunds,  which I think  is  really where our examination  of  the  issue hasto  be.  In examining the  take-out,  we  ought  to  make certain  that wetalk  to  them with respect  to  the  question of what happens  if  they donot  get  the appropriated funds.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Mr. Chairman,  the  Exchange  Stabilization Funddoes not have appropriated funds.1/31-2/1/95-64-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are  we going  to  be  getting a  take-outfrom  the  Exchange  Stabilization Fund?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think  that  is  what  is  in  the  program.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That  is  not  the  same  as  the Treasury.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Even if  we didn't,  the  precedent in  the  1960s--Ithink  there was  a question then about whether  the  Treasury couldengage  in foreign  exchange  operations  outside  of  the  ESF--was  the useof  Roosa bonds  in the  1960s.  The Treasury  floated Roosa  bonds  toobtain  foreign currencies  and used some  of  those  currencies  to  take usout.  That  did not  involve  appropriated  funds.  That was  treated  as  adebt-management  operation.  The Roosa bonds were  issued under  theirdebt-management portfolio.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Since we have  double  collateral,  if  youwill  excuse  the word,  the  interesting question  is:  If  there  is  adefault,  do  we  go  first  to  the  oil  proceeds  or  to  the  Treasury?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I would  suggest,  though  maybe  it's  not  the  rightthing  to  suggest,  that we would go  first  to  the Treasury.  If  theTreasury went  to  the  oil  collateral,  if  I may use  that word, thatsource  of  repayment  would go  first  to  us.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  When you  say  "go  first  to  the  Treasury,"  theTreasury then  is  providing the  backing, not  the  ESF?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I said  the  "Treasury;"  I meant  the  ESF.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I will  forego  my question.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  If  I may, Mr.  Chairman,  I just  want  to  makesure  I have the  numbers  straight.  We  now have a  $3 billion  swap  line.

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  $4-1/2  billion.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Right,  $4-1/2  billion.  I want  to make  sure  Iunderstand.  Is  the  $20  billion package  on  top  of  the  $18  billiontotal  package we  have now?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  No.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Then  it  is  the  same  thing?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  It  subsumes  the  $9 billion that  we have now.The  $18  billion  is  comprised  of  $9 billion  from the  United  States,  $1billion  from  the  Canadians,  $5 billion  from  the  BIS,  and  $3 billionfrom  the  commercial banks.1/31-2/1/95-65-

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Let  me  just  cut  through and  ask what  ourexposure would be  including  the  amount  of  warehousing we would becontemplating  in  the  total package?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I don't  consider warehousing  to be  exposure,but--.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  figures  would be  what  the Mexicans  draw  fromus  and  our warehousing with  the  Treasury.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  It's  $6 billion for  the  Mexicanswith a  take-out  from the  Treasury.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes, with a take-out  from the  Treasury.Essentially  it's  $26  billion with the  Exchange  Stabilization Fund.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  $26  billion?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  $6 billion would be part  of  the  $20  billion,so  it  would be--

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  It's  twenty minus  six,  is  it  not?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Six billion dollars  would be  dedicated  to takingus  out.  The  twenty  includes  both what we  advance  in  the  short  run andwhat  the  ESF advances.  The maximum exposure  to  Mexico of  the  ESF andus  that  is  now contemplated, matches,  so  to  speak,  the  $20  billion  ofthe  warehousing.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Is  the  new amount  from  the  IMF  in  addition  tothe  stand-by arrangement  they have already--the  $7-3/4  billion?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They haven't  approved that  stand-by  arrangementfor Mexico  yet;  they will  consider  that  tomorrow.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  If  they do,  is  it  in  lieu of  that  $7-3/4billion or  in  addition  to  it?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The two  are added  together.  So  it  will now be$17-3/4  billion rather  than  $7-3/4  billion.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Let me  just ask:  How big is  the  ESF right nowin  terms  of  its  assets?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Roughly $25  billion in  liquid  assets,  of  which$5 billion  is  in  dollars  and  $20  billion  is  in  foreign  currencies.  Italso  has  about $9 billion of  SDRs,  but most  of  that  is  matched on  theliability side  of  the balance  sheet  by liabilities  to  the  FederalReserve.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  How have  the markets  reacted  to  thisannouncement  today?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Ted, how did  the markets  close?1/31-2/1/95-66-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Quite  positively.  The  last  time  I looked  thepeso  was about  5.70,  having weakened earlier to  a new  low of  6.55.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  When  I spoke  to  Governor Mancera  he  saidit  got as  low as  6.70  to  6.80.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It  closed today at  around  5.70  to  5.80  and  theirstock market was  up about  9 percent.  It's  very positive  afteryesterday.  I caution  that  the peso  level  is  only at  Friday's  close.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  What happened  in Brazil  and Argentina?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't have  the closing  levels  in  front  of  me.The  stock market  in Brazil  was  up  strongly.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  What  about  the  U.S. market?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  In  the U.S.  the  Dow was  up  about  14  and  thedollar  was up  about 2 pfennigs.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The bond market was  up  25/32.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  long bond closed  at  7.69  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further questions  for  Ted?  I'msorry;  go  ahead,  Cathy.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  The amount  of  funding  that  was  initiallysuggested  for  commercial  banks  and investment  banks was  a small  amountof  the  original  $18  billion,  $3 billion or  so.  My understanding ofthat  from banks  in our  own District  was  that  it  was being madecontingent  on  the  $40  billion.  Now  that  the  $40  billion  is  gone,  isthere  any part  of  this package  that  is  coming  from any of  ourinvestment  banking organizations?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I don't  think  it was  ever  contingent  on  the  $40billion  because  it  was put  into  the  market  before  the  $40  billion  inguarantees was  announced.  But  it  was  contingent  on  the  BIS  facilitythat  existed.  It  was  to be paid out pari passu with  the  BIS part  ofthe package.  The  truth of  the  matter  is,  speaking frankly,  the  bankshave  not been particularly supportive  of  this  operation.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  My guess  is  that  once  this  situation  stabilizes,there  will  be  some  effort  to  suggest  that  the  banks  could be  a  littlemore  supportive.  One  of  the dominant  themes  on Capitol  Hill  has  beenthe  question  of who peddled this  paper, and  although a  lot  of  it  isnot on  the  balance  sheets  of  the banks,  they did  a  lot  of  peddling.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Is  the way  to  add up  these numbers  20  plus  15plus  10  plus  1?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Twenty plus--

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  If  the  IMF is  preparing an expanded  supportpackage totaling  $15  billion,  should  that be  $17  billion?1/31-2/1/95-67-

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  $17  billion!

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Twenty, 17,  10,  and 1?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes.  Well,  2 would be  the  last  number.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Oh yes,  I  forgot  that.  Okay,  a total  of  $49

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Someone will  throw  in another billion.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  A billion here,  a billion there.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  We usually manage  to  double  count one of  thesebillion.things.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Yes.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  The amount  now contemplated, whether  it  is  $49billion or  $50  billion,  is  now some  $10  billion over  the  $40  billionthat  was  in  the proposed  legislation, which  seemed  like  a big  numberto  begin with.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  On  the  other hand,  the number  before was  the  $40billion plus  the  $7 billion plus  the  $5 billion.  So,  the  two  totalsare broadly commensurate.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Ted, credibility has  been a problem all  along.I want  to  ask two  questions.  First,  you  said that  Governor Mancerawants  $2 billion  so  he  can pad his  balance  sheet before  it  is  releasedtomorrow.  Now, one  of  the  things that  would be most  useful  in  thelong term would be  for  the  Bank of  Mexico  to provide an honestdescription of  its  balance  sheet  not  only to  us,  which would beuseful,  but  to  the public  at  large.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Absolutely!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  After we pad his  balance  sheet  tomorrow is  thisgoing to  stop?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Governor Mancera is  very conscious now that  hehas  a commitment  to  announce his  reserves after  the  end of  everymonth.  My understanding  from  the people  I have talked  to  is  that  hisintention would be  to  say,  as  he  did  the  last  time  the  Bank announcedits  reserves--and  this  is  a  small but  significant  step  forward--thathis  reserves are  X and  that  those  include  drawings  on the  NorthAmerican  swap  lines  of  Y.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  they  are not  releasing  the  Bank of  Mexico'sbalance  sheets?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Not  yet,  but  I think that  will  be  part  of  theTreasury--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we will  find,  after GovernorMancera  reported all  his money supply  and reserve numbers  in  the Wall1/31-2/1/95-68-Street  Journal  today,  that  it  is  going be difficult  for  them to  saythe  drawings  do  not  exist.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  That  is  right.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They  existed--and that  was  the  problem!

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Could I clarify something?  WhatGovernor Mancera  said  just  a couple  of hours  ago  was  that,  if  beforethe  end of  the  day today he  is  informed that  we the  United States  arewilling to  make  these  $2 billion  available, he would envision when  heannounces  his  reserve  figures  to  say  that  they have X,  say  $2.4  to$2.8  billion, and  in addition, because  I don't  think we  can get  valueto  them  today, that  he  had agreement  from  the  Federal  Reserve and  theExchange  Stabilization Fund  for  an  additional  $2 billion, valuetomorrow presumably.  So  he will  lay  it  out  accurately, I think.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think  the  major concern--and  that  is  onlypartly addressed by this  since we  tentatively plan,  at  the  momentanyhow,  to  lock up  funds--is  that  announcing he  has  $2.4  billion  inreserves,  given  the kind  of problems  he  is  up against,  does make  himlook  rather naked.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  My second  question has  to  do with ourcredibility.  I don't  know what  questions  to  ask, and  I hope you  willhelp me  out  in  that  regard.  I have  this  document  in  front  of  me,which  includes a page  entitled  "What is  the  Exchange  StabilizationFund?"  The document  came  from Treasury  International  Affairs.  Igather  it  was written by them.  I have written  enough of  these  to  knowwhat  you do,  and  that  is  to  tell  your  point of  view.  Paragraph  3, notto mention  the  dots  indicating  an  omission  in paragraph 2, got me  alittle nervous.  Paragraph 3 says  these holdings  in  the  ESF  are usedto enter  into  swap  arrangements with foreign governments,  to  financeexchange market  intervention, to provide  short-term bridge  finance,etc.,  and  all  these  things  are  great.  So,  basically paragraph 3  isestablishing  that  this  is  not  unprecedented.  My question would be:Do we  do  all  these nice  things  if  it's not  in  support  of  the  dollar?Is  this  unprecedented with regard  to  the  fact  that we are  supportinganother  currency?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  language  before  the  dots  is--

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I am talking  about  the  third paragraph.  I willgo  to  the second paragraph in  a second.  I'm  sorry.  I am running alittle  out  of  order.  It  is  saying  the  ESF has done  all  these  things.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  legislation  governing the  objectives  of  theESF was  changed,  I think  for  the  most part  in  the mid-  to  late-1970s.The  changes  included the  language  that  the  government  of  the  UnitedStates  and the  International  Monetary  Fund have  the obligation  topromote orderly exchange  rate  arrangements  leading  to  a stable  systemof  exchange rates.  That  was  interpreted  to  include making loans  toBolivia  in helping  it  maintain  a system  of  stable  exchange  rates.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  So  that  has  happened before?1/31-2/1/95-69-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes.  They have made  loans  to  or  financialarrangements  with at  least  37  countries  around the  world over  the  last50  years.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I think we  all  will be  asked questions aboutthis.  Can you read this paper and tell  me that  there  is  not  somethingmissing  that  I should know about, meaning  that this  is  not  only thetruth but  the  whole truth?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I can  only say that  Treasury lawyers have  lookedinto the  question  of whether these  operations  are legal  under  thisbroad authorization of  what  they can do and what  the purpose  is--

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  If  I can help out?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  It's pretty clear that  these ESF operationsare  authorized.  I don't  think  there  is  a legal problem  in  terms ofthe  authority.  The statute  is  very broadly worded in  terms  of wordslike  "credit"--it has covered things  like  the  gold swaps--and itconfers broad authority.  Counsel  at  the White House called  theTreasury's General Counsel  today and asked  "Are you sure?"  And theTreasury's General Counsel  said  "I am  sure."  Everyone  is  satisfiedthat  a legal  issue  is  not  involved,  if  that helps.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Is  there anything missing on  this page?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  No,  there  is  not.  If you  look at  the  lastparagraph, for  example,  that is  part  of  the  statute.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  About  notifying Congress  in writing  in  advance?

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY.  The statute  says  that with  the permission  ofthe  President  they can make  loans.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  In  the penultimate  paragraph, what  is  theidentified source  of repayment?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  The Mexicans historically have beenvery  sensitive about  that.  Now the whole world is  informed that  thereare  oil payments  as  an assured method  of  repayment.  The Mexicans,  forreasons with which you would be very  familiar given Mexican history,have  been rather  sensitive  about that  being quite so open  as  it  isnow.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Does  this  legislation contemplate taking 100percent  of a country's oil  payments  for  four years  to  insurerepayment?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Not  the  legislation--but  operations  for  threeyears.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  But  you  indicated that  in  fact  that might not bethe  way it  falls  out.1/31-2/1/95-70-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I was  trying to  live up  to  Governor Lindsey'sentreaty that  I suggest  the  questions  one  could ask as  well  as  theanswers.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  You said  this  might be outstanding  to  the ESFfor what--10  or  20  years?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We  have used  these  arrangements  five  times  since1982.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  The  oil?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The provision  for payment  from oil  exportproceeds.  We  never have had to  have recourse to  them.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I don't mean that.  Has  the  ESF  ever  been usedto  provide  financing,  as  I think you said  earlier was  a possibility,that was  outstanding for  as  long  as  10  or  20  years?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Ten.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Ten years.  Is  there any precedent  for  that?The  law seems  to  contemplate  short-term bridge  financing.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  earlier  ESF balances agreement  also  ran  formultiple years.  Whether  it  ran as  long as  10  years  I can't  remember,but  it  is  unusual  to  go  that  long.  There is  a difference betweenwhether  it  is  legal  and whether  there  are precedents  for  having doneit.  It  is  unprecedented in that  the  loans  are  expected to beoutstanding that  long.  So  they got  involved  in offering  us  arepayment  guarantee.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  May I ask a question about  the  $40  billion  thatwas  in the  proposed legislation?  I believe  that  legislation did notcontemplate  giving the Mexicans any money but  was  offering loanguarantees  that  in  effect would have  substituted the  credit  of  theU.S.  government  for the  credit  of  the Mexican government.  Presumably,they would have had  to roll  over  short-term  debt  at  very, very highinterest  rates  because of  the  default  risk.  Was  the  point  of  the  $40billion guarantee  to  eliminate  that  default  risk and  to  lower  theirinterest  rate  structure?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  And to  allow them to  stretch out  the  debt--toreplace short-term debt  at  high rates with long-term  debt.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Okay.  Now we  have  stopped  talking about  the  $40billion;  now we  are  talking about  a certain number  of  billions but  thewhole nature  of  it  has  changed.  Have  they said what  they are  going touse  this  money for?  I think it's  different  from what  they were  goingto  do  if  we had given them  the  loan  guarantee.  Is  this  just  strictlyfor use  to  intervene  in  the  foreign  exchange markets  to  drive up  thepeso?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think the  Treasury's  intention  is  to  secure  afinancial plan  from the Mexicans  about what  they will  do with  thatfinancing--that  is,  their whole debt-management  strategy.  This,  ofcourse,  would have  to  be worked  out  by agreement  between  the Treasuryand  the Mexicans and we would participate  in  terms  of  our own part  inthat.  As  would have been provided for  in the  legislation,  the  plan1/31-2/1/95-71-would have  to  be  in place before  a substantial  amount  could be drawnfree  and clear.

[SECTION]

MR.  MCTEER.  This  does  not address  their credit  risk problem,though.  Anybody who  invests  in  their paper  still has  that  toovercome.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The Mexicans would  in effect  be  substitutingcredit  from the U.S.  government or  the  Exchange  Stabilization Fundrather  than from  the private market  as under  the  previous guaranteeprogram.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  So,  instead of  taking our money and using it  intheir operations  in  their  financial markets,  they will  be  taking ourmoney and offering  it  as  a promise of  repayment.  Is  that  what you  aresaying?  It  just  seems  that the  whole nature  of  the  thing has changed,and we have  not gotten rid  of the  credit risk problem.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  In one  case  they would have borrowed  the moneywith  the  full  faith and  credit  of  the United States  in  the private

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  In  the  second case  they either  do  that,  which  isone  possibility, or they would borrow  the  dollars  from  the UnitedStates Treasury which would borrow in  some  sense  from  the  ESF.  TheESF does not have  dollars but  it  has  Treasury bills  that  it  couldsell,  and the proceeds would be  invested  in Mexican obligations.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  But we  have moved  from  loan guarantees  to  directlending.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes,  to  direct  lending;  we  are in more of  acredit risk position  than we were before.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Ted, why is  the  Federal Reserve  involved inthis?  Is  it  because of  a liquidity problem  for  the ESF?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  We are  involved  for  two  reasons.  One,  the  ESFdoes  not have  the  liquidity, so  that  involves  us  in  the warehousing.The  other relates  to  our participation--this would be  short-termparticipation--through the  existing swap  line,  the  enlarged swap  line,and  the  suggested super  enlarged swap  line.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  The  latter would have us  involved for how long?For  the  ten years  that was mentioned  earlier?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  No,  I think for  one year.  That  is  one  of  thereasons why I did not put  a specific proposal  to  you today.  What  Ihad been thinking, but  I wanted to  do  it  tomorrow morning when  I had aclearer head, is  that you might want  to  set  something up  so  that  theycould draw up to  $6 billion.  But  once  they had drawn  $6 billion andthe  drawing had been outstanding  for  12  months  it  would have  to  berepaid, and they could not  redraw on  the  enlarged portion of  the  swapline.  The Committee  would decide over what period--or maybe  it  couldbe  for  two  periods--the Mexicans would be  allowed to  draw on  theenlarged swap  line.  And after that  point they might be allowed  to1/31-2/1/95-72-roll  the  drawing over  up  to  three  times  and  then be  required  to  repayany unpaid balances.  As  the  drawings were  repaid, the enlarged  swapfacility would be  extinguished and  they could not  redraw  on  it.  Theswap  line would  drop back to  our normal  swap  line agreement  and  anyfurther  drawings would require  Committee clearance.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Could I ask  a question?  Ted,  this  is  aslightly different  issue.  A  couple of  days  ago  there were rumors  inthe  market  that  the  reserves  of  the  Mexican government  had droppedfrom post devaluation  levels  of  about  $6 billion  to  $2 billion.  TheBank of  Mexico  immediately  denied that  those  levels had gone down somuch.  Now, tomorrow they  are going  to announce  that  they have  roughly$2 billion  in  reserves plus  an  agreement  to get  $2-1/2  billion  fromus.  That  is  still  considerably below the  $6 billion which was  alreadylower than  their  earlier reserves.  What  is  going  to happen?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  They  announced on  the  9th of January that  theirreserves were  $5.6  billion.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Yes,  but  they quickly denied  that  theirreserves  had  slipped to  the  $2 billion  level.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  As  of  yesterday their reserves  were  above  $2billion.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  My question  is:  What  is  this  announcementgoing  to  do  to  the market  confidence?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't  think anyone  thought  five days  ago  thattheir reserves were  still  at  $5  to  $6 billion.  There  is  nocredibility  loss  because  they are  down closer  to  $3 billion.Yesterday, the market was  saying  that they were  at  $2 billion;  theMexicans denied  it  and said that  they were above  $3 billion.  Now, onecan  split  hairs but  they were by all  accounts,  and  in terms  of  theirconversations  with us,  above  $3 billion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  They were at  $3.4  billion.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  $3.4  billion.  We  are  getting down  to  smallnumbers,  but no  one  thinks  there will  be a credibility  loss  becausethey were at  $6 billion earlier  and  tomorrow they will  announce  $2billion.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  In  other words, you  don't  think  that  theannouncement  tomorrow will  in any way  offset what  has  been done by thePresident  and our  facility?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It's  not  going  to offset  it  entirely.  Peoplewill,  as people  in  this  room did, sort  of  take  a little  breath andsay, well,  that  is  a  low number.  But  I think the  President's packageand all  the  things  that have come  out  today should mitigate  theeffects  of  that  to  a great  extent.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  What  are  the  implications of  the  Treasury justdusting out  what  they have  in  the  ESF  to provide  liquidity to  the  ESF?1/31-2/1/95-73-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Do you mean sell  those  foreign currency  assetsin  the  market?  In  this  case,  it  would be  just  like  any  other  exchange

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Are  they  liquid holdings?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes,  Peter holds  them  for  the ESF.  They arereasonably  liquid.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Yes,  they are  reasonably liquid  instruments.  Ithink  the  sum jumped up  today.  The dollar/mark  today was--well,  Ithink dollars  had been a  little  oversold and people were coveringback.  But  some of  it  was  rumors  that,  in order  to  do  anything,  theUnited  States  might be  selling  all  the  marks and yen  immediately.Now, that was  mostly a skittish  thing going  into  a rather  anxious,jerky market.  I don't put  too much  stock  in  that.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Although  that  might  explain some  of  the behaviorof  the  dollar  today.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It  is  fair  to  say that  as  a policy measure,  oneof  the  reasons why  the  Treasury chose  to  go with  the  loan  guaranteeoriginally  rather  than using  the  ESF was  that  by going  to  the ESF,even  with our  cooperation, they  felt  there might be  some  sense  thattheir  ability to  defend the  dollar with  existing  foreign  exchangebalances was being  impaired.  And,  therefore,  if  forced  to  sell  out  tothe  market,  their ability to  defend  the dollar  subsequently would bedifficult without  foreign  exchange  reserves,  even  aside  from what  onenot particularly  "gung ho" on  intervention, but  they  are  "gung ho"  onhaving some powder  in  the magazine.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  Shall we  call  it  an evening?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We need  some  sense  of  the Committee's  view onthe  "drawing" or whatever word you want  to  use.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  As  Ted  indicated, we  think itwould be  useful  in  this  context  to  agree  to  our  billion dollar  lockupof  reserves  to  Mexico.  The  reason  for  the  lockup,  frankly,  is  thatuntil we  know that  everything  is  in place,  I would not  feelcomfortable  exposing ourselves  even with the  collateral.  But if  weget  a  take-out and everything  is moving  along,  then all  the  riskelements  to  the  Federal  Reserve will  be  gone.  I think we'll probablyget  fairly good confirmation of  that  soon--by  tomorrow, do you  think?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  It may  take  us  a little while  to  work out  thetake-out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  any objection  to  ourauthorizing a  $1 billion  drawing from  the  $4-1/2  billion swap  line  tobe  locked up  for  the  Bank of  Mexico?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  As president  of  the  Bank where  themoney will be kept,  I can  assure you  that  we will  keep  a very closeeye  on  it!1/31-2/1/95-74-

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Is  this a matter  that needs  Committee  approvalor are you  just  consulting?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, actually  it  does  not need approval,but  I would feel uncomfortable  if  there were  a significant  negativeresponse even  though you have  already  given me  the  authority.  Thissituation  is  changing  and has  changed sufficiently that  I want  to makecertain  that  there  are no  significant  changes  of  views  on  the  overallposition.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I am very concerned about  the  overall  proposaland how it  would involve  the  Federal  Reserve.  To  the extent  that  afurther drawing would involve us  further  in this  arrangement,  I dohave concerns.  At the  same  time  I recognize  that you have  theauthority  to do  it  and  that you are being prudent  in  terms  of  how thatmoney would be  secured.  It  is  hard to  object  to that  in  isolation.In  fact,  I don't have  the  right  to,  really!  But  it  does  concern me  interms  of being  another  step  in  the  direction of  a toe  in  the water,then  the  foot,  the  leg--that  is  what  I am concerned about.  I know weare  going to  be discussing other  aspects  of  this  issue  tomorrow, but  Ifeel  that  if  I did not  express  that  concern now, I would not  betotally  forthcoming.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We are  going to  get  to  the  other  issuesfirst  thing  tomorrow morning.  Yes,  Tom.

MR. HOENIG.  I have to  ask you, when you  say  "lock up"--Are  we committing  to  this  now?  Is  this  something  that,  if  we  have achange  of  heart after our discussions  later,  we  can not  take backbecause we  are  in this  now?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't  think  so.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  As  President Melzer  said, previously--the actionwas  taken  on  December 30th--you  approved a special  increase  in  theMexican  swap  line  for  a short  period of  time.  Now,  in  fact  thedrawings  by Mexico  are  still within the  $3 billion  swap  line  thatexisted before  it  was  expanded with  the  special  arrangement  on  the30th  of December.  So,  you are  operating under what  was previouslyagreed upon.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I understand and  I hear what Tom Melzer  said.What  the Chairman  is  saying is  that  things  are changing quickly.  Yes,we  have  approved  it,  but  what  are  we buying  into?  That's  what  I justdo not know.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  answer,  I suppose,  is  that participation inthis  current  phase requires  action on  the  warehousing limit  for  one.Secondly it  involves  acting on  the  proposal with  respect  to  raisingthe  $4-1/2  billion  swap  line to  some  number, or  not  raising  it,  andarticulating how long  the enlarged amount would be  outstanding beforeit  reverted to  the  $3 billion normal  size  of  the  swap  line.  So,  ifthe Committee  does  that,  I am done.

MR. JORDAN.  I am not  voting this  year but  if  I were,  I wouldoppose  the package because  of  the warehousing.  Once  this  Committee  isin on  the warehousing, we are  in  and we  are going  to  be  in--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The only thing  I object  to  is  that  thatis  a subject  for  tomorrow.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You can be  the  first  one  on  the  floortomorrow!  I am  just  saying the  clock  is  ticking.  Let's  get out  ofhere.[Meeting recessed]1/31-2/1/95-76-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Since the  Mexican discussion may beopen-ended, I thought  it  would be  desirable  to  put  it  at  the  end ofthe  agenda  and start  this morning's  session with Peter  Fisher on bothforeign  currency and domestic  open market  operations.  Peter.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will  be  referringeventually to  the  three  colored charts  on  the  single  sheet  of  paperdistributed this  morning.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Peter, we have  seen  the  current accountdeficit  of  the United States  rise  continuously in recent  years.Projections  now suggest yearly deficits of  around  $200  billion in  thenext  couple of  years,  and there  is  no  evidence  of  any retreat.  It  hasalways been the  conventional wisdom  that, because  of  the prominence ofthe  dollar in world portfolios,  the  U.S.  dollar was  driven largely byportfolio  shifts and  that  the  net  flow of  claims  against  the UnitedStates, which  are virtually all  in dollars,  really was not  a majorforce  because of  the  huge size  of  the  stock.  But when we are  gettingdeficits  of  $200  billion, that  strikes me as  no  longer de  minimis,  andI am curious  to  know how you evaluate  the presumably depressing effecton  the dollar  from the  cumulating current  account  deficits.  How wouldyou evaluate  the  general  effect of  the  deficits  on both the  level  andthe  trend?  In  other words,  are they  fully discounted in  the  market  sothat  there  is  only a level  issue?  Or  are  they not  fully  discounted,implying that  there  is  further potential  erosion  stemming from  thefact  that we  are going  to  borrow, net,  $400  billion over  the  next  twoyears?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  There  are  two aspects  I would  focus  on.  One isthe  trend, as  you point out.  What  is  disturbing,  or  important, to  theforeign exchange market  is  the  sense of  rising current  accountdeficits;  the  foreign exchange market  sees  the  trend in  the  currentaccount  as being against  the  dollar.  If  there were  to be  forecasts  ofstable  $200 billion current  account deficits  for  5 or  10  years,  thatmight be  something to which  the  foreign exchange market  eventuallywould adjust.  So,  I think a big component  is  the  fact  that  thedeficit  seems  to  be  ratcheting up,  and people  in  the  market  do not  seewhere  the process might  stop.  Obviously,  the  level  is  also  important;and  in  the past  year, as  you have  all  read and have heard at  thistable,  the  combination  of  the  current  account deficit  and the  outflowof  U.S.  savings  in search of  portfolio  diversification abroad was  seenas  having a piling-on effect  by the  foreign exchange market.  Marketparticipants did not  see  where  the  demand for  dollars  was  going tocome  from.I certainly err  in  the  direction of  being  interested in  someof  the  micro mechanics  of  markets,  so  you will  have  to  forgive me.But  I think  it  also  is  important  to  keep in mind that,  increasingly,all  sorts  of  managers  of  funds  and portfolios abroad who areinterested  in holding dollar  assets view the  foreign  exchange exposurecomponent  of  that  as  something  that  has  to  be managed completelydifferently.  These foreign holders  set  aside  their dollar  assetssubject  to  exchange rate exposure  and give  them to  someone  to manage.And so,  even  if  foreign  investors view holding U.S.  Treasuries  as avery good  investment,  they probably have passed off  to  some  othermanager X billions of  their dollar  exposure  to  be managed on  a perhaps1/31-2/1/95-77-slightly more  aggressive basis  in the  foreign exchange market.  And sostable  flows--stable  for  the  foreign  exchange market--may be  a thingof  the past  for  the portfolio  manager.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any other questions  for  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I have one.  It  has  two parts,  the  first  ofwhich  is probably unanswerable,  but  if  you want  to give  it  a shot,  goahead.  The  question is:  What  would you  imagine the  implications are,for  the peso and  the  Canadian dollar,  of another  50  basis  points  onthe  federal  funds  rate?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  With regard  to  Canada,  I would expect  theCanadians  to  add 50  basis points  themselves.  The Bank  of  Canada hasleaned very strongly against  the wind in  the  last  few weeks  and indoing that has  impressed their markets.  That  is,  the  Bank of  Canadaraised its  rates, and when market rates  started  to  come  back down, theBank  kept taking action to make  sure  the  rates  stayed up.  After  thatwas  done  two  or  three  times,  the  yield on  30-year bonds  fell  30  basispoints.  If  the  Bank of  Canada  adjusted basis-point-for-basis-pointwith us,  I think the  Canadian dollar would be  relatively stableagainst  the  U.S.  dollar.  I don't mean  to  jump  too much into  the  funthe  Committee will have  this  morning, but  I think the  importantquestion is  compared to  what?

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes,  compared to  zero.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  If  it  is  a 50  basis point  increase  in thefederal  funds  rate  compared to  zero,  I think  zero would be  quite badfor  the  Canadian dollar.  I also  think our own markets would be ratherdisturbed by  zero  and  that it  would be worse  for  the peso  than  50basis points.  If  one  looks  at where  the market would  like to priceMexican  assets,  50 basis points  added to  the  cost-of-carry just  is  notworth  anything.  So that  is  not  the  issue.  The  issue  is  stability ofthe  interest rate  environment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further  questions?  Yes,  Tom.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I had understood Ted Truman  to  say yesterdaythat  $1 billion  had been  drawn down  on our  swap arrangement,  and youjust  said $1-1/2  billion, Peter.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Combined.  The Mexicans  drew $1 billion earlier,divided equally between  the  Federal Reserve  and  the Treasury.  Lastnight  they drew an additional  $2 billion, of  which $1 billion is  fromthe  System.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.  I was referring  to  their  total  drawingsfor  the month on  the Federal Reserve.  That  is,  we  did $500  millionearlier  in  the month and  last  night we accepted their  request  andlocked up an additional  $1 billion.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  So  the  total  outstanding on  our portion  of  thatfacility  is  $1-1/2  billion?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That  is  right.1/31-2/1/95-78-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I was  talking  about  the  combined amount  for  theUnited States  and Peter was  talking  about  the  Federal  Reserve  portion.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions?  If  not, wouldsomebody  like  to move  to  ratify  the  transactions  of  the  domestic  open

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is  there a  second?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN AND OTHERS.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let's move on  now tothe  staff report  with Messrs.  Prell  and Hooper.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  How high  is  the  unemployment estimatethat  the  CEA  is  currently using?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It  looks  like  6 percent  is  the  fourth-quarterlevel  that  they are working with at  this point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  They cannot  publish  that  in  the  CEAreport.  Going up to  the  Hill  and  saying  "our program will  raise  theunemployment rate  by more  than  1/2  point" will  hardly get  ringingendorsements.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Given  that  their projected output  growth will bepretty much in  line with  their estimates  of  the  trend of potentialoutput,  it  will  look  somewhat  anomalous  on  that basis.  But when  theywere  developing  these numbers  earlier,  they were working  from  a muchhigher base.  It  is  hard to  tell  but  they could say  in  the EconomicReport  that  the  news  is  good,  the  numbers now look better,  and so  wehave  adjusted  the  figures  that  appeared  earlier  in the  budget.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mike,  in  both  the  Greenbook and  in your oralpresentation you  remarked  that  you had reexamined the  economic modelthat  you  use,  the  approach  that  you  use,  in bringing  these  forecaststogether,  and you concluded that  your model  tracks well  enough.  It  iswithin  the confidence  intervals  for  1994.  And as best  you can  tell,there  is  not  enough evidence yet  to  say  that  the NAIRU  is  differentfrom 6 percent.  Accepting that,  I went back  a year  to  see what  theforecast was.  I am assuming  that  looking  at  things  ex post  is  stillthe best way;  the  model  itself  of  necessity had to  be built judgingthis  ex ante--hindsight  does  not help  here.  A year  ago  the projectedunemployment  rate  for  the  end  of  1994  was  6.8  percent,  and  for  1995  itwas  6.8  percent.  We are now at  5.4  percent.  I look  at your currentprojection  for  the  unemployment rate  for  this  year  and your projectionfor  1996,  which we  did not have a year ago,  and  I also  look at  the1/31-2/1/95-79-CPI,  which came  in below  the  estimate  for  1994  but  is  now projected  tobe  .3 percent higher  for  1995  than you had  it  a year ago.  So,  if  themodel  is  still  working, that means  the  lags  are a lot  longer  than youestimated  earlier and  the projected outcome  is  someplace  further  outin  the  future,  or  it  would  cost  1.7  million  jobs  to  reduce  theinflation rate  by  .3 percent  just  to  make  the model  consistent with ayear ago.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I think we went  through  this  last  time,  and Iwon't repeat  the  four-part  harmony answer  on  the  1994  error.  In asense, we were  thrown off by some movements  in  the numbers  in  1993that caused us  to  hesitate to  follow the model  religiously.  Lookingback over  the past  year--as you noted and we noted in  the  Greenbook--the behavior  of  prices  is  not  out  of  line with the model  forecast overthe past  couple  of  years  on  the  assumption of  a NAIRU  in  the  6 percentarea.  The behavior of  compensation,  including  the  latest  reading,might on balance be  a bit more  favorable--too high in  1993  relative  tothe model  and on the  low side  in  1994--and  that perhaps  raises somequestion, but  it  is  still  within  the  confidence  interval.  At  thisare well  in  line with conventional  short-run  Phillips  curve analyses.We  run many different models  and we  get  different  answers,  and I thinkthis  is  a reasonable ballpark estimate  of what  the history embodied inthese  models would  suggest  is  likely to  happen  in  1995  on  theassumption that we  get  this  kind of  employment  data.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I'm still missing something.  If  the  differencebetween  .8 percent above  the NAIRU  on last  year's projection and  .6percent  below it  is  only  .3 percentage point  in the  CPI,  how wide isyour  confidence  interval  around the NAIRU?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I would say usually 1/2  percentage point.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  So  the NAIRU  is  6 percent plus  or minus  1/2percentage point?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think that  is  a reasonable  range.  We mightnarrow it  a bit but we would be  pressing science pretty hard.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  the  estimated equilibrium real  interestrate  is  mentioned  in the  Bluebook in  the  section where  there  is  adiscussion of  the  simulations of  the  FTS  model.  A very interestingresult is  that,  if  the  greater  fiscal  restraint were put  into effect,the  equilibrium real  interest rate would decline  by 1-1/2  percentagepoints.  I found that very  interesting,  and I assume it  was  a resultof  some simulations  of  alternative  scenarios.  Could you describe  theprocess  by which you get  this  estimate?  I would really be  interestedin what  your estimate  of  the  level  would be  if  there were  no  fiscalrestraint.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Basically, we have  an  estimate  of  about  1-1/2percentage points  for what  the  elimination of  the  structural  deficitwould do.1/31-2/1/95-80-

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That  is  exogenous?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  No.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It  is  a 1-1/2  percentage point  decline  in  theequilibrium real  rate  that  came  out  of  the  model  simulations.  I thinkto  get  a sense  of  the  level you  might  look at  the  chart  in theBluebook  that  follows page  11.  The  end point  there  for  the  funds  rateis  6-1/2  percent without  fiscal contraction  and  5 percent with  thecontraction.  That  is  your  1-1/2 percentage point decline  in  the  realrate.  The  inflation  rate  is  about  3-1/2  percent,  so  I would  say thatwithout  fiscal  restraint  the  equilibrium real  funds  rate--this  iscutting things much too  fine--is  approximately 3 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  This  is  obviously an  "iffy" proposition  and tosome  extent  one might view  this  as  schematic  as  opposed to veryprecise.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I understand.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It  is  our belief  that  real  rates have beenelevated by  the  structural  deficits  of  the  1980s  and  elimination  ofthe  deficit would yield a lower real  rate.  One  of  the  things we  haveto  speculate about  in  this  forecasting process  is  the  anticipatoryeffects  that  might  result.  Estimating  those  effects  is  verydifficult.  One  has  to  think beyond  the  financial markets  to  otherkinds  of  responses--to  expectations  about  cuts  in  taxes  and  federalspending.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Well,  as  I said,  the  fairly  significant  declinein  the  equilibrium real  interest rate  is  a very interesting  result.

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  Mr. Chairman,  I would  like  to  come back  forjust  a moment  to  try  to provide  a  footnote  to Mike's  response  toPresident Jordan.  One  thing  to  remember  is  that  a year  ago when wewere  dealing with  the changeover  in  the  Current  Population  Survey, wewere  expecting  that  revision  to  add  in excess  of  1/2  percentage pointto  the  unemployment rate.  We now  think  the  addition  is  more  like  .2percent.  So,  that  is  part  of  the  explanation  for  the  difference  lastyear,  and the  revision  also  is  leading us  to  change  the projectedunemployment  rate  in comparison with what we were  indicating earlier.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Just  a clarification question  to  you, Peter.You talked  a  little about,  and the  Greenbook also  referred  to,  somebacking off  in  the  growth of  foreign  demand  for U.S.  exports.  Butthis  morning you  are still  talking about  continued robust  growth.  AmI understanding you  correctly?  Is  there still  some backoff  in yourprojection?

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  The  decline  in  foreign demand  is  related to  theMexican  situation.  Excluding Mexico, we  do not  expect  a significantchange.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  You  are not  looking  for  a change  in  Europe  orelsewhere?1/31-2/1/95-81-

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  There  is  a little  drop in  Canada's rate  ofexpansion because  of  their  monetary policy tightening--

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  But  otherwise  the  outlook  is  still  prettystrong?

[SECTION]

MR. HOOPER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  there  are no  further questions  forthe  staff,  obviously the  rest  of  us have  all  the  answers.  Who wouldlike  to start?  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, growth  in the  Twelfth Districteconomy  is  gathering momentum.  Employment growth has  picked up andthe unemployment  rate has  continued to  fall,  in  large  part due  toimprovement  in California.  Within the  state,  economic  conditions  haveimproved in both northern and southern California.  Recovery in ourDistrict  should stay on  track,  although  several  recent  developmentswill  likely damp overall  growth  and have more pronounced effects  onsome  regions.  In California,  for  example,  floods  are affecting  somecommunities  quite  a bit,  but without having much effect  on  the  stateeconomy overall.  In Orange County, the  losses  in the  county'sinvestment pool  have  been marked down to  about  $1.7  billion.  Also,spreads between  rates  on California  State debt  and other  tax-freedebt  have narrowed  some.The  earthquake  in Japan also  is  reverberating  in California,holding down  shipments between the  damaged port  of  Kobe  and major WestCoast ports  such as  Oakland, which counts  on Kobe  for  about  9 percentof  its business.  High-valued  shipments between  Oakland and Japanreportedly are  going  through ports  other  than Kobe, but  the  increasedtransport  costs  are  limiting  shipments of  lower-valued products suchas  animal feed.The devaluation  of  the peso could hit  states  like Arizona andCalifornia harder than most  other  states.  But  assuming that  thecurrency situation stabilizes,  we do  not expect  this to  preventfurther economic  growth.  Still,  some businesses  in  southernCalifornia are greatly concerned  about  the  situation  in Mexico.  Anarea  of  particular concern  is  San Diego where  the unemployment ratehas  not  improved as  much as  has been the  case  in  Los Angeles  and whereretail  sales  recently have weakened as  a result  of  the  crisis  inMexico.Turning to  the national  economy,  it  is  clear  that  employment,output,  and spending all  exhibited  surprisingly  strong growth lastyear.  As  a result,  the  economy now has  attained levels  of  labor  andcapacity utilization  that  are  inconsistent with steady  inflation, tosay nothing  of progress  toward lower  inflation.  In our  outlook,nothing suggests  that  the monetary tightening  of  last  year will  slowthe  pace of  real  economic  activity sufficiently over  the  forecasthorizon to produce  any slack  in the  economy.  This point is  also amplydemonstrated by  the Greenbook forecast.  With no  further tightening,there  likely will  be  a deterioration in  the  inflationary environmentin  1995  and  1996  as well  as beyond  the  forecast horizon.  Thank you,Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.1/31-2/1/95-82-

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  New England  continues  to recover  from  therecession at  a moderate pace, with substantial variation  in employmentgrowth  from  state to  state.  Long-term structural  issues  continue  toplague  the  region with  defense  downsizing, uncertainties  in healthcare,  and re-engineering downsizing or  rightsizing--whatever you wantto  call  it--affecting many of  our  large  employers.  On top  of  all  ofthat,  we do not have  any snow!  Tourism buoyed the  District  throughthe  summer and  the  fall;  it  has been  less  of  a factor  this winter asmild temperatures  and  some rain have  dimmed ski  area prospects.Beyond employment and the weather,  other  indicators  suggest  thateconomic activity  is  continuing to  expand.  Specifically, help-wantedads,  consumer confidence,  housing permits,  and a lot  of  anecdotal  datashow some  strength to  the  continued recovery.  Manufacturing contactsare generally positive but  retailers  are more varied.  We  continue tohear  reports  of  input  price  increases,  especially paper, but  sellingprices  have not  yet  ticked up generally.  I might  also note  that whileeverybody is  complaining  about paper prices, producers  of  paper  inMaine have  a different  attitude;  they  think  that  paper prices  areabout where  they should be.I noted  at  our  last meeting  that  the  District's bank loangrowth  trailed the  rest  of  the  country substantially, with annualgrowth  rates  in all  categories  about half  or  less  than  that  of  otherDistricts.  We have done  a little work with the  Senior Officer LoanSurvey  to  try  to  determine why  that  is  the  case.  The  First  Districthas  shown relatively  stable  loan demand and no  relaxation of  creditstandards.  This  is  quite different  from  the  nation as  a whole  andundoubtedly reflects concerns  by  the  banks  in our District about  assetquality after  the  recession.  In  addition, First District  banks  stillhave relatively  larger  securities holdings  than banks  in  other  areas.They have had  sizable realized and unrealized portfolio  losses  thisyear, and their  stock prices  have  suffered as  a result.  All  in all,  Ithink  their appetite  for  risk  in  1994  was not  very great,  thoughcontinued moderate growth  in  1995  in  the  region and nationally maychange that  somewhat.Turning  to  the  Greenbook,  I applaud the  inclusion  of  a "nochange" baseline  to  compare with a likely alternative path.  It wasvery helpful  to me  in  assessing what  the various  factors  are  in theGreenbook forecast.  I was  a little struck,  though, by how littledifference  it  seems  to make whether  or not we do  anything.  In  thebaseline forecast,  inflation rises  by  .4 percent  this  year  and onlyabout  .1 percent  next year--if  I have  those numbers  right--whileunemployment  stays  well  below the  NAIRU  in both years.  In  thealternative path, we make  marginal inroads  on  inflation  in  1996,  againwithout  the unemployment rate  rising above  the  natural  rate.  It  maybe  that  things  have  changed  in  the  labor markets  along  the  linessuggested  in  the Greenbook, but  I do  not know  that we have  anyevidence of  this;  I think that  is  close  to  what you were  saying, Mike,when you were talking  about  the Greenbook analysis.  As  Part  II  of  theGreenbook points  out,  there is  no  reason as  yet  to  expect muchcompensation growth, given  that  the  third-quarter unemployment  ratewas  6 percent.  We have had only one quarter with the unemploymentrate below the natural  rate.  We  need  to  avoid the human  tendency toindulge  in  some  wishful  thinking.  Our  own expectations  are  thatinflation will be  a bit  more  of  an  issue than  the Greenbook suggests,especially in  the baseline projection.1/31-2/1/95-83-In sum,  I think  the Greenbook is  really well  done this  time.I liked it  a lot.  I am putting  in  a vote  for you to  do  it  this  waymore often, Mike, even  though it  is  more work for you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, on balance  the  Seventh  Districteconomy  is  still  growing  at  a moderate to  vigorous  pace,  althoughthere  has been some easing recently in a few interest-sensitivesectors.  As  I said to  the Committee  last  time,  two U.S.  automanufacturers  reported cuts  in orders  from dealers  as  early as  mid-recently,  there  has been a lot  of  discussion in  the press  about  apossible slowdown  in the  auto  industry.  In addition to  dealer ordersbeing down,  reports now indicate  that  for  some models  inventories  haverisen, production  schedules have been  trimmed, and new incentiveprograms are being offered.  In addition, used  car prices  have beeninformation to  determine  to what  extent  demand has moderated.  Ourassessment  is  that while  there has been  some moderation in  salesgrowth, most  of  the recently reported signs  of  slowing overstate  thedegree  of  moderation, in part because  1994  was  such a strong year  forauto manufacturers, suppliers,  and dealers.  We expect  auto  and lighttruck sales  to  increase  about  2 percent  in  1995.  This  issignificantly  slower than  the  8-1/2  percent  increase  in  1994,  butproduction would reach a strong  level  of  about  15.4  million units  in1995.One  area where the  signs  of  slowdown are  becoming clearer  isin  the single-family housing sector.  For example,  builders  andrealtors  in  the  Chicago  area started  seeing slower traffic  and salesin  the  fourth quarter  of  last year, particularly  in  December despitequite  favorable weather  that month.  Reports  from District  retailersare  mixed.  Sales  gains remain heavily concentrated in  hard goods,with apparel  sales  still  slow.  Some retailers  express  concern abouthigh inventory  levels,  although it  is  interesting  that  the LoanOfficers  Survey  indicates  that banks are not  concerned about  loans  forinventory financing.  Competitive pressures  are  still  reported to beintense,  and increased promotional  activity  is widespread.  TheDistrict's manufacturing  sector ended  1994  on  a very high note withmany industries,  especially in  durable goods  manufacturing, reportinga record or near-record year.  While  some industries  expect  to  exceedthose  levels  this year,  the  widespread expectation  is  that  growth willmoderate.  Utilization  rates  are  quite high and  in many  cases  abovethe peaks  reached in  1989.As  I reported earlier,  raw materials price  increases  arepervasive.  Although many  firms  are  unable or  unwilling  to pass  onsuch price  increases  to  their  customers,  some  firms  are  now expressingthe  belief that  price  advances are becoming more  feasible.  Forexample,  rapidly rising sales  and backlogs have led to  two priceincreases  within a month in  the  heavy paper industry.  Obviously, wedid not hear this  from Cathy's Maine producers.In  agriculture, recent developments  indicate  the  District'sfarm  sector is  holding up better than we had anticipated.  A sharpunexpected decline in  exports  from China has  significantly enhancedU.S.  corn export  prospects.  However,  the peso  devaluation will1/31-2/1/95-84-undermine some  of  the  near-term agricultural  trade  benefits  that  hadbeen expected to  accrue  from NAFTA.  In particular  for  the Midwest,some  of  the  recent gains  in corn exports  may be  lost.  In  addition,the  earthquake in  Kobe may briefly disrupt  our trade patterns withJapan, which is  the  largest  foreign market  for  U.S. agriculturalcommodities.On  the  employment  front,  labor markets  remain quite  tight.In many metropolitan areas,  the  reported unemployment rate  is  below 4percent,  including a rate  of  3-1/2 percent  in  the metropolitanDetroit  area.  A few reports  indicated outright shortages  of  clericalworkers,  and concerns were  expressed  about  the  inability  to  findsufficiently well qualified workers.  Wages  for  clerical workers arereported to  be up more  than 10  percent  from a year ago.  Overalleconomic  activity in  the  Seventh  District is  consistent with anational  economy that  has moved  into  a range where a pickup ininflation  is  considered likely.Turning  to  the national picture,  our  outlook for  real  GDPgrowth  in 1995  is  similar  to  the  Greenbook's  alternative projection.Growth  in real GDP  should taper off  significantly over  1995.  Theinflation  outlook  is  one  area where we  are  less  optimistic  than theGreenbook, even assuming  further monetary policy  tightening this  year.While we  tend  to  agree with the  Board  staff estimate  of  the NAIRU, weexpect  to see  consumer prices  responding more  rapidly to  the  low rateof  unemployment  than  is  forecast  in  the Greenbook.  As  a result,  weexpect CPI  inflation  to rise  perceptibly to  ranges  in  the  neighborhoodof  3-1/2  percent  by the  second half  of  1995.

MR. BOEHNE.  The Philadelphia region  continues  to  expand,with some evidence  that  the pace  of  expansion is  slowing.  Wage  andprice increases  generally remain subdued, but  with labor  marketstightening,  there  is  some  concern, more  than  I have heard before,about building  inflationary pressures.  Manufacturers report  thatindustrial activity is  still  on an  upward trend, but  some  slackeningfrom the pace of  the  fourth quarter  is  occurring.  Gains  are morecommon  in metals and  equipment, while  steady-to-declining  activity ismore characteristic  of nondurables.  Retailers  in general  werereasonably pleased  about holiday sales.  They did not  do  as  well  asthey  had hoped, but well  enough not  to  be  complaining.  Sales  inapparel,  which was  the weakest  area  in  December.  Existingnonresidential structures  are still  selling  at prices belowreplacement  cost  in  the  Philadelphia area,  so  there  is  little need fornew construction.  Residential  construction  is  clearly feeling  theimpact  of  higher  interest  rates.  Loan volume  is  growing moderately,with middle market  companies prominent  among new borrowers.  There arestill  reports--I would  say an increasing number of  reports--thatunderwriting standards  are  slipping and complaints  from bankers  thatloan pricing does  not adequately compensate  for  risk.  With risingloan demand, there  is  more  competition  for  deposits.  Labor markets  inthe  District have  tightened  noticeably during  the  last  couple  ofmonths.  Some  employers  expect upward wage and price pressures  downthe  road.  Others believe  that  there  is  still  much potential  forfurther productivity  gains and  that  such gains plus  intensecompetition will  continue to  contain wage  and price pressures.1/31-2/1/95-85-My  reading of  the  national  economy is  that  we are  likely tosee  moderating growth as  the year progresses,  largely  from  less  robustpersonal  consumption,  less  inventory  investment, weaker  residentialconstruction,  and perhaps  not as  strong export  growth  as  we previouslythought.  Nonetheless,  moderating growth is  still  a forecast with theusual  amount  of  uncertainty surrounding  the  degree  of  moderation andthe  timing.  On  the  inflation  side,  the weight  of  historical  evidencepoints toward some  cyclical  rise  in  the  inflation rate.  It  isprobably true, however,  that  the  economy is  now less  inflation pronethan  it was  in  the  last  decade or  so.  Whether  it  is  a little  lessprone or  a lot  less  remains  to  be  seen.  The answer  is  probably inbetween--not  as  optimistic  as  some would have  us believe but betterthan our  models suggest.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Forrestal.

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman, the  Southeast  economy continuesto  expand, although we have  seen  some deceleration during the  fall  andearly winter.  Employment growth  in  the  District  outpaced the nationlast year but our  unemployment rate  fell  relatively less  because  ofin-migration  to  the  area.  We are  expecting an  unemployment rate  of5.7  percent  for  December when  the  final  numbers  come  in.  Retail  salesgrowth has  been relatively strong,  led by durables,  although we  haveseen  a noticeable  decline  in  auto  sales  from very high levels.Dealers view the  current pace as  sustainable.  Tourism is  mixed at  themoment.  In  the very  large  Florida market,  the  usual  strong  inflow ofCanadian visitors  has  been restrained by weakness  in  the  Canadiandollar and,  to  some degree,  by the  high  cost  of health  care  forCanadians when they  travel  outside Canada.  Also, unseasonably warmweather  in  other parts of  the  country has  hurt  Florida  resorts andcruise bookings.Manufacturing activity grew moderately in December and earlylevels  remained quite high  in industrial  chemicals, paper, pulp, andmetals.  Manufacturers  report  that  the markets  for  building materialsand home  furnishings have  softened recently.  In  the  important  defensecontracting area,  contractors  remain under pressure but  foreignmilitary orders  are bolstering  activity at  some  plants.  A broad rangeof  industries  in  the  region have posted  significant gains  in  exportssince  the  implementation  of NAFTA, but  there  is  now considerableconcern that  the  sharp  devaluation of  the peso will  cut  into  thoseexports;  in  fact,  we are  already beginning  to  see  a little of  that.Realtors  in most  of  the  District report  that  sales  of  single-familyhomes  have  slowed due  to  rising interest  rates, but multifamily andcommercial construction continues  at  a pretty good pace.  Bank  lendingactivity is mixed in  the  District.  We  are  getting some anecdotalreports  about  a lessening of underwriting standards,  but  consumerdefault rates  are  continuing  at  a quite low  level.  We  still  hearreports  of  difficulty in  getting  skilled and unskilled workers;  thatis particularly true  in  Tennessee.On  the  inflation  side, we are  seeing more pressures on pricesbut  that  is  somewhat sporadic.  The deceleration in housing  has  easedpressures  on prices of  materials  and has  alleviated  shortages  of  semi-skilled labor  in  many areas.  Retailers  anticipate that  vendors  aregoing  to  raise  prices on new merchandise, but  they are  concerned thatthey are  going  to be  unable  to pass  these  increases  through to  the1/31-2/1/95-86-consumer  level.  Reports  of  rising prices  of  raw materials remain  verywidespread with the pressures  most  intense  for  chemicals, paper, andtextiles.Looking at  the  national  economy, I too would like  to  applaudthe  staff  for  including an  alternative  forecast.  I think  it  is  very,very helpful.  I would hope  that  this  can be done on  a more  frequentbasis.  We  revised our  forecast upward when  it  became  clear  toward theend of  the year  that  the  deceleration we had anticipated was  not goingto  take place.  We  do  show some moderation  in  the  future.  Ourbaseline forecast  is pretty much the  same as  that  in the  Greenbook,although we  do  show somewhat  greater  strength in  real  GDP  than  theGreenbook and somewhat  higher  inflation.  I would  like  to  believe  thatcapacity utilization constraints  are not  going to be as  important  asthey once were and that  the  shortage of  labor is  not  going to  passthrough  into wages, but  that may be wishful  thinking.  At  the  end of1996,  we have a 3.6 percent  rate  of  inflation.  Again, I would like  tohope and believe  that  that will  be  the  cyclical  peak for  inflation  andthat  it  will  come  down from that,  but  that  may be wishful  thinking.I think  the really  important  question and  the  difficult  issuethat  we have  to  face will be  the  need to  stop  adjusting  our policiesat  a time when current  data still  appear strong.  If  we believe  inpolicy lags,  we  need to  start  asking  ourselves how we are going  toknow and what we will  look  at  that will  make us  decide  that we  havedone  enough.  It  is  the  opposite  to  the question of  inflation.  Whenwe  see inflation, it  is  too  late,  and  it may be  too  late  for  us  tostop when we  begin to  see  deceleration.  That  is  a very tricky  issuefor  us  to  face.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  The  reports  we have received lately  indicatethat  overall  conditions  in  our District are  still  generally robust.Like  a lot  of  other people,  we have  seen  some  signs of  deceleration inparts  of  the  District  and in  some  industries,  but  really nothing ofsize.  There are  just  too  few signs  to reach any definitive conclu-sions  at  this point.  At  their January meeting, our directors  wereuniformly bullish.  They  said their  local  economies were  holding upsurprisingly well  in  the  face  of  recent  interest  rate  increases.  Theyalso  reported widespread optimism regarding the  outlook  for  theirlocal  areas  in  the year  ahead.  One  director at  the meeting didexpress  concern  about the weakness  in  apparel  sales  over  the  holidayseason, but  even  she  said that  in  general  things  look pretty  strong.Some  directors  continue  to  report rising price pressures  atearlier  and intermediate  stages  of  production.  These people  stillexpect  at  least  some of  these increases  to  be passed  through  to  finalprices  in  the near future.  In  fact,  our monthly service-sector  surveydid show a pickup  in retail prices  from November  to December.  Ourlatest monthly survey of  the  manufacturing sector suggested  a slightvarious  indexes we use remain quite high in  terms  of  levels.  TheNorth Carolina economy, as  I have reported before,  still  is  extremelyrobust--lots of  manufacturing activity there.  There are  some  signs  inthe  middle part  of  the  state,  in areas  like  the  research triangle ofRaleigh-Durham and in  the  Charlotte  area,  of  some  labor  shortages  andat  least  a few  signs  of upward pressure  on wages in  some  industries.1/31-2/1/95-87-Another  thing  from  the District  that might be worth mentioning:  Oneof  my directors  who  is  especially conscientious  in gathering usefulanecdotal  information  for  us  called me  late  last week.  He  told methat  in  the  last week  three  general  contractors, whom  he normallysurveys  for  each of  our meetings, had called him of  their  own accordand  told him that  just  in recent  days  they either had to  revise  or,  inone  case,  actually withdraw a preliminary bid on  a major  constructionproject because  they were getting  bids  from their  subs  that were muchhigher than anticipated.  The main  reason for  this  appears  to  havebeen  increased pressures  on prices  of  materials, but apparently  laborcosts  also played a role.As  for  the  national economy, I would join  Cathy Minehan  andBob  Forrestal  and others  in  complimenting the  staff  on  their analysis.I thought  it was  very well  done.  I was  especially interested in  theimpact  that  the  changed assumption has  on  the  outlook  for majormacroeconomic variables  over  the next  couple of  years.  The  assumptionof  a constant  funds  rate  compared to  the  December projection does  havea noticeable cumulative  upward  impact on  GDP growth and  employment bythe  end of  1996,  with only a relatively small  increase  in  theinflation  rate--.3 percentage point by  the  fourth quarter  of  1996  tobe  exact.  In any case,  it  is  fair  to  say  that  this new projection  iscalling  for what  reasonably could be descibed as  a classic  softlanding.  I think a favorable  outcome like  that  is  certainly possible;that  is  basically what we are  projecting.  As  a number  of  people  havepointed out,  we already have  seen  some  initial  signs  that  ourtightening actions  last  year have  begun to  cause growth to  moderate atleast  in  some  sectors.  But  again, as  everyone  knows,  we  recently havegotten a string of  exceptionally  strong economic  reports  that  indicateclearly that  whatever may be happening going  forward,  the  economy hasentered this  year with  a great  deal of  momentum.  Even housing  seemsto  be holding up pretty well  in  the  face of  higher interest  rates.Back at  the  December meeting, I said that  I thought  the  risks  in  thenational  outlook were more balanced than  they had been earlier  in theyear.  I still  think  they are more balanced than  they were  severalmonths ago,  but  I think they are  less  "more balanced"  than  I thoughtback in  December.  In  this  regard, it  is worth noting  that  the  longbond rate, while it  is  still well  below its high  in mid-November, hasstopped declining.  It  stopped declining  in  early December and hasbeen basically  in  a holding pattern at  around 7-7/8 percent  sincethen.  That  suggests  to  me  that people  still  think  the  expansion  atleast  for  now is  continuing at  an  unsustainable pace.  I think  theyare waiting  to  see what we  are  going  to  do  about  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  The Ninth District  economy remains  healthy.Unemployment  rates  are  almost uniformly low throughout  the District.Employment  gains  over the past year have  been very substantial,  andthere are  labor  shortages  in  many parts  of  the District  right nowwhich over  time certainly will  slow  the pace of  expansion.  Notunrelated  to  what has  been going on,  there  are  also  housing shortagesin  many parts  of  the District.  Apartment  construction in  some  ofthose  mid-size communities  is very substantial,  at  least  by theirhistorical  standards.  Obviously,  that will  help  to  alleviate  thehousing problem over  time, but right  now, even  if  employers  in  thosecommunities  could attract more  labor,  they would not have  any place  tohouse  them.  Despite  these circumstances,  there  is  still  no widespread1/31-2/1/95-88-evidence  of  an  acceleration of  wages.  There are perhaps  a few morereports  than  there were  a few months  ago  of  some pickup  in wagepressures, but  they still  are not widespread.  That  is  not what  Imight have anticipated given  the  clear evidence of  labor  shortages.Overall,  the  District  economy continues  to  do  quite  well.Natural resource  industries  had a very good year:  We  already havetalked a little  about  paper and forest products;  mining of  iron,copper, and so  forth also  has  done well.  The  retail  sales picture  hasnot been much different  than  elsewhere  in  the  country.  We  have had abifurcated pattern where hard goods have  been selling well  and softgoods,  especially apparel,  have  not.  I don't pretend to  have anyinsight  into why that  should be the  case.  The weather has  been mildand the  lack of  snow has  affected tourism, which had been runningquite strongly for  a good number  of years.  So,  it  has not  been a goodwinter  in many parts of  the  District as  a consequence  of  the  weather.The other  thing I might mention about  the  District  economy  isthat  it  seems  to be  widely,  though not  universally, expected that  1995will  not be  as  strong a year  as  1994.  I suppose  there  is  nothingremarkable  about  that  in  the  sense that  1994  was quite  a good year  aswas  1993,  and people  just naturally are  cautious  that this  can't  go  onforever and there may be  a sense  that  we are  bouncing off  the  ceiling.These attitudes  have been around  for  a while;  there  is  nothing  thathas  triggered them.  It  may be  that people  simply have been  takinganother  look at  consensus  forecasts  that  things will  slow, but  thatdoes  seem  to  be  the prevailing  attitude.With  regard  to  the national  economy, I must  admit  I am  a bituncomfortable about  the  inflation outlook.  I am particularlyuncomfortable  if  I adopt  the  Greenbook  framework, which emphasizescapacity pressures  and  a NAIRU  of  around  6 percent.  It  seems  to methat,  in  that  environment, we will  get  an acceleration of  inflation.probably  is  not wholly independent  of what we  choose to  do.  In myjudgment,  that  is  where  the  risk is.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  The U.S.  economy continues  togrow more rapidly  than  forecasters had  expected and likely morerapidly than can be  sustained, with a four-quarter  growth rate  throughthe  end of  last  year of  about  4 percent.  The unemployment  rate  fell1.3  percentage points  in  1994  to  5.4  percent  in  December.  In  theEighth District, unemployment  is  averaging 4.2  percent  in  the  majorstates and  stands  at  3.9  percent  in  the  St.  Louis  area,  the  lowestlevel  in  decades.Nationally, employment gains  have been robust,  with theeconomy adding  about  307,000  jobs per month from  January throughover  the  last  year:  Arkansas  and Kentucky registered payrollemployment  gains  at  an  annual  rate  of nearly  6 percent during  thefall.  Some  of  our District  states have  picked up  some momentum.During  1994,  employment  in  our District actually was  growing moreslowly than  in  the  nation as  a whole.  In  fact,  contacts  throughoutthe  Eighth District report that  labor markets  are  the  tightest  theyhave  seen  in years, with wage pressures  in  evidence  in some  markets.1/31-2/1/95-89-District  retailers  reported holiday  sales up  6 to  7 percentover year-earlier  levels,  and post-holiday sales  generally have metexpectations,  reducing retail  inventories.  In a recent  survey ofsmall  businesses  in  the  District,  about  3/4  of  the  repondents  saidthey  expected the  current  boom to  continue  or  gather strength  over  thenext  six months.In general,  the  performance  of  the  economy has made  a mockeryout  of  the  slowdown  scenario widely predicted last summer  for  thesecond half  of  1994  on  the  basis  of  the  inventory buildup in  the  firsthalf of  the  year.  Is  it  possible that  the  slowdown  scenario nowwidely predicted for  1995  is  also  wrong?  Our  forecast envisions  realoutput  growing about 3 percent  in  1995 with  the  CPI  inflation rateincreasing to about  3-1/2  percent.  Unemployment  in  the  fourth  quarteris  forecast to  be  about  the  same  as  its  current  level.  Otherforecasts--both  from  the private  sector and  the  Greenbook, even  in  thecase  where no  further tightening  is  assumed as  in the  Greenbook--lookfor  a sharper  slowdown  in  1995  than we do.  These  forecasts  of  a weakeconomy appear  to  be  based in  large part  on  two  observations:  (1) theeconomy has  a strong tendency to  return  to  trend, and  (2) the  level  ofinventory  investment has been  abnormally high.  While  it  is  true  thatthe  economy does  tend  to  return to  trend,  the pace  at  which such  areturn occurs  is  highly variable and still  could be  many quartersaway.  Though recent  economic  performance  has been  strong,  it  has notbeen nearly as  strong  as  in  some  other  expansions  and above-trendgrowth might well  be  sustained  through 1995  as  the  economy continuesto  work off  the  enormous  amount of  liquidity that was  created  in  1991through  1993.  A prospective  downturn in  inventory  investment  isanother negative consideration, but  I continue  to  think  that most ofthe  recent  inventory accumulation has  been planned, which  I believe  isconsistent with what Mike  said, as  a means  to  meet  expected demand.The  inventory/sales  ratio  is holding  at  an historically  low level.In short,  while  a slowdown is  bound to  occur at  some point,presently there  is  little  hard evidence  of  it.  In my view, the  riskof misjudging the  thrust  of  demand growth on  inflation  remainssignificant despite the widespread opinion  that  substantially  slowergrowth is  ahead.  In that  light,  a disturbing  feature of  the  currentsituation  is  that most private  forecasters  expect  little  improvementon  inflation  over the  next  two years  or  for  that  matter  over  evenlonger  periods.  That  observation  reflects poorly on  the  credibilityof  the FOMC's  commitment  to  price  stability.  With respect  to  CPIinflation,  the  recent Blue  Chip report  predicts 3-1/2  percentinflation  in  the  current quarter  and  little change to  the  fourthquarter of  1996  where  the projection  is  3.6  percent.  Likewise,  thecurrent Administration assumption has  inflation rising  to  3.4  percentin  the outyears  of  their budget projection horizon and basicallystaying there  indefinitely.  Recent  long-term government  bond yieldsof  somewhat less  than  8 percent  suggest  longer-term  inflationexpectations  substantially  above current inflation.  We  certainly havea way to  go  to  establish  the kind  of  inflation credibility thatexisted before we  lost  it  in  the  1970s.

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The Tenth Districteconomy remains strong,  bolstered by healthy  gains  in  its  keyindustries  across  the  states.  Our  directors  from all parts  of  the1/31-2/1/95-90-District report  a robust pace of  business  activity.  A director  fromour  utilities  industry reports  strong growth  in  electricity sales  toimportant  industrial  customers  including  manufacturers of  steel,automobiles,  and plastics.  In  the  transportion  industry, growingdemand  for  shipments  of coal,  automobiles, and  other productscontinues to  strain capacity.  A national manufacturer of  homeimprovement products in  our District reported exceptionally  strongsales  over  the last year.  His  company has,  for  the  first  time  inseveral years,  successfully passed  increases  in prices  to  hiscustomers.  Director  reports  about  shortages  that  I commented onpreviously are not  coming in  strong.  Whether  that  is  because  somehave  stopped reporting because  they  already have done  so  several  timesor because  conditions have changed  is  not  certain.Recent  employment data confirm  anecdotal  reports  of  economicstrength.  Nonfarm  jobs  in  the  District were up  nearly  3 percentaverage.  Three  of  our states  including New Mexico had job growthtwice  the  national  average.  District manufacturing activity continuesto  strengthen, with most of  the  improvement  in the durable  goodsindustries.  Our  contacts  in  the  automobile  industry tell  us  that  theDistrict's  assembly plants  are  operating at  very high rates  ofcapacity.  Construction activity remains  brisk but  the  industry's  mixis  shifting.  Housing  construction is  slowing, while  commercial  andpublic works  construction  is  strengthening.  The  energy industryremains  weak due  to  crude oil  and natural  gas  prices.  Theagricultural  sector has  strengthened on  improvements  in  livestockprices.  Bank credit  continues  to  increase  at  most  of  our Districtbanks, with strong  loan  growth more  than offsetting runoffs  inholdings of  securities.  Our bank directors  remain very positive  abouteconomic conditions.At  the  national  level,  I believe  there  is  still  considerablemomentum in most  sectors  of  the economy.  I think this  momentum willextend well  into  the  second quarter  of  this  year, at  least.  We areperhaps  beginning to  see  some moderation, but  it  is  a moderation  froma very high  growth rate  and  it  leaves  overall growth well  abovepotential.  I do  remain concerned about  inflation prospects.  I ampleased  that we  have  not yet  seen  an acceleration of  inflation  at  theconsumer level.  Anecdotal  evidence as  well  as  our  experience over  thepostwar  period suggest  it  is  a matter  of  time.  More  specifically,  Iagree with the  Board staff's  assessment  that  rates  of  unemployment  andcapacity utilization are currently at  inflationary levels.  Given thelag  structures,  I still  would expect  to  see  a gradual  increase ininflation  in  final  goods  this  year.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A pausehas developed in New York City, which has  slowed  the  economicexpansion  in  the  Second District despite  sharp recorded drops  in  theweakness,  fortunately, is  largely confined to  the New Yorkmetropolitan  area.  In  the  remaining two-thirds  of  the  District,recovery appears  to be  intact,  led by moderate gains  in New Jersey andmore modest  growth elsewhere  in New York State.  In  December, New YorkState payroll  employment was  stagnant  following  four consecutivemonths  of  decline.  The comparable New Jersey  figures  have not been1/31-2/1/95-91-released, but employment  growth has  averaged 1.6  percent  at  an annualrate  over  the past  five  months.  Probably because  of  reduced earningsand bonuses  in  the  financial  industry, personal  income tax  collectionsfor New York State  and City  fell  7 percent below a year ago  inpersonal  income tax  collections were up  nearly  20  percent  in NewJersey  in  September,  the  latest  reported month, while  the  year-to-that  the  sales  rate  of  existing homes  declined from the  third  to  thefourth quarter and the median price  fell  between  5 and  10  percent,depending  on  the  location  in the  District.  The  aggregate consumerprice  index  for New York and northeastern New Jersey rose  at a  rate ofjust  2.1 percent  in  December  and 2.4 percent  for  the year.  In  thefinance  sector, people  continue  to be  very blue.  Members  of  thesecurities  industry reported  sharp declines  in  fourth-quarterearnings,  ranging  from 50  to  80  percent.  Numerous  new layoffs  wereannounced among banks and brokerage  firms,  including the  verystrongest.Despite  all  that,  there does  seem to  be  something of  animprovement  in  attitude  in New York State.  Even  in  the  area betweenAlbany and Buffalo,  traditionally  a strong manufacturing  area  andwhere  the  unemployment  rate  is  not  that  high--ranging  in  about  the  4to  5-1/2  percent  area--the attitude  that  I encountered up  there  six  orseven  months  ago was  generally very dismal and now it  is  improvingquite a lot.  Fortunately, it  is  not  that  people  think the newgovernor  is  going to  wave  a magic wand and  fix  everything.  It  israther that  with  the  likelihood of a more pro-business  stategovernment,  they are  getting more  of  a notion of  helping  themselves.For  example,  in  Syracuse where I was  last week,  a manufacturingcompany  could not  find enough workers  and was planning  to  leave  thearea.  The Chamber of  Commerce  managed to  find enough  skilled workersfrom  among  its  member businesses  to  enable the  company  to  stay in  thetown.  That attitude of  "let's do  it  for ourselves"  is  something thatI have  been encouraging in  speeches up  there.  We  do  seem to  be makingsome  progress in  spreading the  notion  that if  the  governor  can dosomething good, that  is  terrific.  But  if  business  can help  itself,that  is  even more  so.On the national  level,  we  too  have  a general  difference withthe Greenbook  in  that under  the  current policy assumption, we  havereal  GDP somewhat  stronger,  almost  1/2  percentage point  higher.Unfortunately, we  also  have  the CPI  at  3.3  percent Q4-to-Q4.  We havea very  low unemployment rate  at  5.1  or  5.2  percent.  We  have done  some"what ifs."  Even  if  the  optimists  are  right  and  the NAIRU  is  5-1/2percent  instead  of  6 percent,  it  would appear  that  we have  a rate  ofeconomic growth  in  the  system  that  is  going  to  create more  inflationanyway.  It  is  only  if we have  very low employment growth  andrelatively  slow additions  to  the work  force  that  in our  forecast wewould get up  to  the  5-1/2  percent unemployment  rate.  So,  we do  haveconsiderable concerns  about  the  likelihood of  inflation picking up,and  in  fact  our  economic  forecast  under  current policy  assumptionsshows  a pickup.I also  applaud the new approach  in  the Greenbook.  I think  ithas,  among other  things,  helped us  to  talk about  the  economy and nottalk about  policy in this  part  of  the meeting.1/31-2/1/95-92-

MR. JORDAN.  There  is  not much  I could say about  the  FourthDistrict  to  add to  what we put  in  the Beigebook  or especially  to whatMike Moskow  said about  what  is  going  on  in  the  Seventh  District.  Inmost  respects,  developments  in  our  two Districts  are very similar.We pay a  lot  of  attention  to manufacturing, both because  ithas been so  strong  in  the Fourth  District  and because  of  its  absoluteshare  or relative  size.  Manufacturing employment  in  Ohio,  forinstance,  is  twice  the national  average  and is  very heavilyconcentrated in motor vehicle production  and related capital  goods.So, we pay a  lot  of  attention  to  it.  Our average  workweek  last yearwas  about  2 hours  longer  than  for the  country as  a whole.  Ourunemployment  rate  is  much lower.  The rate  in  Ohio as  a whole is  overa  full percentage point  lower;  and  in  certain metropolitan areas  inKentucky and within  Ohio and western Pennsylvania, unemployment ratesare  much  lower  than  that.  Nevertheless,  we are not  seeing  an  effecton manufacturing  wages, which  rose only  1.1  percent  last  year,  lessthan  the  national  average.  We  are not hearing  stories  from people  inthe  industrial  sector about  wage pressures.  We  are hearing  that  theyare  planning to  spend a lot  more  for a  third year  on  expandingcapacity  or  improving productivity.  A  lot  of  them  have plans  toreduce  their  current work  force  through productivity-enhancinginvestments.  We have very recently heard some  negative reports  out  ofCincinnati.  The phone  company  there has  announced a very  large  layoffand Federated moved an  operation down  to  Bob Forrestal's  District;  sowe will  experience  a loss  of  about  1,500  jobs  in  Cincinnati.When  I turn to  the national  economy,  I do not  know what  tosay about  the  Greenbook.  I like  having the  alternative  in  there.  Itseems useful  to  have  the  staff  draw up  for us what  they  think anunchanged  fed  funds  rate would  imply and  then an alternative.  But  thebaseline  for  this  Committee  always ought  to  be  to  derive  the  policythat  achieves  our objectives.  Unless  the  Committee has changed  itsobjectives,  the baseline should be producing a downward  trend ininflation  in the  future,  moving us  toward price stability;  analternative  forecast  could be  drawn from  that.  So,  I would haveflipped around  the  baseline and the  alternative that  the  Committeewould discuss.  In  trying to  assess what  I think  about  the  twoalternatives  as  they are  presented, I have problems  with  such  thingsas  the  assumptions about  the  fiscal policy.  It  has  always  mystifiedme  why shrinking  the  federal  government  by having  it  spend less,borrow less,  and maybe even  tax  less  has  a negative  effect  on  theeconomy.  I don't  know what  to  make of  the  fiscal  policy assumption.I do not  find  the  inflation  outlook satisfactory even under  thealternative  forecast.  Either  the model  is  wrong  as  to  what  it  wouldtake  to  get  there  or  the objective  should be viewed  as  unsatisfactory.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The Eleventh  District  remains  strong  except  forthe  border areas.  The most  optimistic  word comes  from Lubbock wherewe  heard at  our  last  board meeting that  the biggest  tightwad  in westTexas  had just  bought  a new pickup truck.  [Laughter]  Of  course,  themood is  just  the  opposite  of  that  on  the border  in Brownsville,  ElPaso,  Laredo,  and McAllen--places  like  that.  They were already weakbecause Mexico had  been imposing a  $50  limit  on what people  coming1/31-2/1/95-93-across  the bridges  could buy and  take back  into Mexico.  Mexico  hasbeen doing that  for more  than a year, but  this  peso devaluation comeson  top  of  it.  A lot  of  merchants  in  those  towns  are being devastatedright now.  Also,  one measure  of  U.S./Mexican trade  is  the  length ofthe  backup on both sides  of  the bridge  in Laredo  on 1-35.  That  backupis  not nearly  as  long as  it  was before  the devaluation.  The  effect  isnot just  on  the border.  All of  Texas  is  going  to be  hit  somewhatbecause Mexico  is  our number  one  foreign trading  partner, and theshare  of  our  trade  is  much higher  than it  is  for  the country as  awhole.  But  abstracting  from that,  the District  economy  is,  overall,still very  strong.On  the national  economy,  the  only straw  in  the wind that  Ican offer  is  some  anecdotal  evidence  that  retail  sales,  while weak  innational  sales  in January were  far  ahead of  expectations.  Theirweakest  areas  in January were California  and Texas--California becauseof  the rains,  presumably, and Texas  because of  the peso.My  economists do not  want me  to  say anything about  the weakgrowth  in  the  aggregates because they believe  that  it  is  wellexplained.  But  after many years  of  paying attention  to  them,  it  ishard not to  be  a little  concerned  that  they  seem so  uniformly weak.But  I won't  bring  that  up.  [Laughter]

MR. MCTEER.  The main other  thought  I want  to  convey  is  thatI agree with Bob Forrestal  in that  I think the  most  crucial  questionfor us now  is  what  we should be watching  to  know when it  is  time  tostop  tightening monetary policy.  How do  we deal  with the  lag whenpolicy is  moving  to  restrain the growth  of  the economy?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I want  to  join whatsounds  like virtually universal praise  for the  new approach  in  theGreenbook.  I thought  it  was very, very helpful  to  have  it  stated thisway.I also want to  agree with what  Bob Forrestal  and Bob McTeerwere  saying  about  the  tendency  to  go  too  far.  There are  some  cautionsigns  out  there.  Even those  rabid  inflationists,  the  Shadow Opensaying,  "enough is  enough."I am not  sure  exactly what a  soft  landing  is  all  about,  but  Iwould like  to pose  a thought  as  to what  it  is.  We  tend to  approachpolicy by looking at  a way of  restricting flows  sufficiently  to  getthe  economic expansion down  to  a  sustainable growth path.  Inpractice, most  major recessions  including  the  1991,  1982,  1980,  and1974  recessions  involved wealth  destruction.  That was  the main causeof  the  slowdown  in the  economy.  I am  toying with  the  notion ofdefining a soft  landing  as  one  where the  slowdown  is  accomplishedwithout wealth destruction.  I hope we keep  that  in  our minds when wethink about how  far we are  going  to go  in raising  interest rates.  TheGreenbook is  about  right  in saying that  we are  going  to  have  a1/31-2/1/95-94-slowdown, but  I think  it  is  going  to  occur  a  little  later  than  theGreenbook is  indicating.I am very concerned about  the  situation  in the  consumersector  where  I think we  are  going  to be  seeing a  cut  in  flows  anyway.The  consumer is  simply overextended.  Of  the  roughly $250  billionincrease  in personal consumption  expenditures  from  the  fourth quarterof  1993  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  1994,  44  percent was put  oninstallment credit,  meaning credit  cards  or auto  loans.  People justcan't  finance 44  percent of  their  increased spending through  higherdebt  and do  that  for very  long.  Mortgage  data  are a similar  concern.If  you  look at  increased mortgage payments over  gross  investment  inhousing in  1993,  the  ratio was  77  percent.  The  80  percent  figure  ispretty standard for  a first-time home  buyer.  If  you  figure  thatexisting homeowners also  are  going  to  be  taking  out mortgages,however,  that will  take  appreciation out  of  existing homes.  If  thatcalculation  is  made,  increased mortgages  exceeded net  investment  inhousing by $55  billion,  meaning aside  from our capital  gains,  peoplewere  taking money out  of  the  housing sector as  well  as  financing 44percent  of  their  increased spending on  installment credit.  That  isjust  not going to  go  on  for much longer.  The question  is:  When is  itgoing  to  stop?I  think the  Greenbook has  the  fiscal  policy  slowdown justabout  right, but  the  fact  is  we  just do  not know,  and we are  going  tohave  to  see.  Again,  I think  the  risks  as  in  the  consumer  sector areprobably on  the  down  side  and not  on  the up  side.  The risks  comebecause  our Congress  is  not a  smoothly functioning machine.  Thebiggest  cog  that  I can see,  and  it  is  a whopper, is  the  debt  ceilingbill.  Assuming Congress  can pass  a budget  resolution in April,  whichis  probable,  the  debt ceiling  traditionally has  been  something onwhich every congressman can hang a bauble  and  try to  get  it  throughbecause  the  legislation has  to  pass  or  else  the government  shuts  down.Since we have  that  coming up,  I think  that  the  risks  in  fiscal policyare big and their  financial  ramifications  are also  large.Similarly, I  think the  risks  in  the  net  export  sector  are  allon  the  down side.  If  one  thinks  about the  uncertainties:  When isDeng going  to  die  in China,  or  is  he  already dead,  and what will  thatmean?  Russia  seems  to be  in  chaos;  the Middle  East  seems  bankrupt;Latin America will  speak for  itself.  All  of  these problems  suggestthat  we have a  lot  of  downside  risks  to  the  economy.There  is  a major  upside  risk  that  has  not been mentioned andthat  I think will  tend  to  delay the  timing of  the  slowdown.  That  isthe  cut  in FDIC premiums,  down  to  4 basis  points,  that  was  announcedyesterday by the FDIC.  That  cut is  in  effect  going  to  be pumping  $5billion more  into  the  capital  of  the  banking  sector.  That  $5 billionwould have been very, very valuable back  in 1991  when bank capital wasconstrained.  At present,  given  that banks are  not  capital-constrainedbut will  want  to  put  that  capital  to  use,  I look  forward  to  suchthings  as  getting  two credit  card solicitations  a day  instead  of  thecurrent  one,  and similar  frivolous  uses  of  bank credit.  All  of  this,I think,  is  going  to postpone  the  inevitable  slowdown.I am  inhave a slowdown.occur  later  thanagreement with  the  Greenbook  that we  are going  toIt will  be  flow-based.  But  I think it  is  going  toin  the Greenbook projection.  That  raises  the1/31-2/1/95-95-question of  whether we have gone  too  far,  and I think it  is  a fairquestion.  We  also  have  to balance  it  with what  I think  is  a veryrisky  international situation.  There  I come back  to being  a two-handed economist, and  I am not  going to  bore you with both hands.Instead, I am going  to wait  to  hear  what you  are  going to  tell  us, Mr.Chairman.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mr. Chairman, as  a dedicated  cynic when  it  comesto  evaluating the  good intentions  of Congress,  I am more  thanmoderately  skeptical  about  a balanced budget  program.  I have  gravedoubts  about  the wisdom of  a balanced budget  amendment.  I do  notexpect  the  states  to  ratify  the  amendment  even  if  it passes  theCongress because  of  the  realization that  expense  cuts  at  the  federallevel will  undoubtedly shift  costs  to  the  states.  For those  reasons,I am unable  to  embrace  the  baseline  forecast  even  though  I expect  someslowdown as  a result of  earlier policy moves.Consumer  confidence remains  high.  In  spite  of  the  additionaldebt  load that  Larry has  referred to,  credit  lines  have been  increasedautomatically by many purveyors of  revolving credit.  That  is  a greattemptation  for consumers  to  continue  to  run up  their  debts.Eventually the  debt  load will  catch up, but  I think the  easier  creditstandards will  build in  some more lead  time.  I am  convinced also  thatwe  may still  underestimate  the  export  sector of  the  economy, even ex-Mexico.  High capacity utilization creates  conditions  that  I think  areeven more  favorable  for making  price  increases  stick.  I believe  thatupcoming labor negotiations  may well  result  in  a greater  focus  onbasic wages rather  than benefits  and work rules.  The stage  now seemsto me  to be  set  for  further  upward pressure  on  inflation.  The rest  ofmy  speech  I have had to  delete because of  the prohibition  againstmentioning policy.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  have  a real  blackout  this  time!Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman, looking  at  the possible coursesfor the  economy, one  end of  the  spectrum would be  that  the expansionis  slowing now, or  it  soon will  be  slowing,  and that  the  slowdown willbe  adequate.  A  real  doomsayer would say that  the  economy already  islocked  into  an excessive  downturn.  At  the other end of  the  spectrum,one  could make  a case  that  the  expansion  is  roaring  along unimpeded at4 percent plus  and we  are  soon  going  to be  into  a true  boom/bustcycle.  We  very seldom in  this  life  get  the  extremes one  way or  theother.There  is,  of  course, a big broad gray area.  It  might bedescribed as  a bit of  a slowdown now, or soon,  but one  that may not beenough  to  accomplish our policy  objectives,  and,  looking ahead,  theexpansion is  very likely to  reaccelerate.  Along  that broad spectrum,history tells  us  that  inflation will  appear under  those  conditions.When will  it  occur and how strong will  it  be  when it  does?  Are wegetting  that  slowdown?  Well,  my guess  is  that  we probably are  to  somedegree.  I won't take  the Committee's  time to  go  through all  thedifferent  components;  you  all know what  they are.  We probably willget  a little  slowing, led maybe by autos  and housing,  less  inventoryaccumulation,  the  Canadian  and Mexican  situations, and of  course  a1/31-2/1/95-96-good bit of  monetary policy  tightening earlier  that  is  still  going  tohit.  But that  slowdown may not  turn  out  to  be very deep,  and  it maynot  continue  if policy were  to  remain  unchanged.We still  have booming  consumer confidence.  As  the Committeeknows,  I have been very concerned  about  the  consumer  for  a  long  time.I thought  consumers would get  conservative a  long time ago.  They havenot yet,  and  I am  about  ready  to  capitulate  in  the  short  run.  I donot  see  that  happening any  time  soon,  given where we  are with new jobformations and  so  forth.  Business  investment will  continue  to  bestrong.  We have  a weak dollar  and  the  foreign  economies  are beginningto  come back,  other than  the  two  immediately adjacent  to  us.  I have ahard time  seeing real  interest  rates  as  being what  one would callhigh.  It  seems  to  me  that  they  are more  on the  high side  of neutralat  this  point.All  in all,  it  seems  to  me that  the risks  are  still  tilted tothe  up  side.  What we  are  most  liable to  get  in my view is  a  littleslowing  that  is  not  adequate to  realize our policy objectives  and anexpansion that  is  likely to  reaccelerate  later.  Following  GovernorLaWare's  lead of  eschewing  any comment  on policy, I will  stop  rightthere.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  I think that  the  impressivenational  growth  that we  have been  talking  about  around  the  table  todayis  showing  a few  tentative  signs  of  abating.  I would  cite  spendingthat  is  off  its  highs.  We  talked about  the  inventory buildup  in  thefourth quarter  and a flattened yield curve--inverted or  humped attimes.  But  even  if  growth  does  abate,  I do  not  think it  is  likely  todo  so  by much, at  least not  very soon.  Business  investment  iscontinuing.  Fourth-quarter profits are  strong enough  to  financecontinued  investment.  The returns  on  investments  are  still greaterthan the  cost  of  capital.  Business has  a continued commitment  toimprove productivity in  a competitive  economic environment.  Just aswe  are  seeing  some  slowdown reported  in the  housing area,  commercialconstruction  is  now recovering and helping  to  take up some  of  thatslack from housing.  But  even housing  is  stronger than might have beenexpected.  With employment at  fairly  lofty  levels,  it  is  likely wewill  continue  to  see  consumer  spending maintained, albeit  possibly ata reduced but  still  quite respectable pace.  The banking system  isquite  strong and can certainly support  expansion.  While  the  financialsupportive of  direct  financing,  I think we  are past  at  least  some  ofthe  uncertainties  in  financial  markets,  and that  is  likely to be lessof  a risk.  The  uncertainties  I am referring  to  are  Orange  County  andBankers Trust.  Mexico certainly  is  still  a  factor, but  so  far  thatappears  to be  contained or  focused on  the  foreign exchange  markets.If  Congress  actually continues  to  concentrate on  deficit reduction,that  too  should provide  support  for  the  markets.  In my view all  ofthese  factors provide  an environment  for  the  continued momentum thatwe  saw coming  out  of  1994.It  seems  to me that  there may be  a different way  of  statingwhether  or not we  are  at  the  cyclical  turning point.  Since  theeconomy  is  operating at  or  above capacity, we have  to ask  ourselveswhy we  are not  seeing  increases  in producer  or  CPI  prices.  How long1/31-2/1/95-97-can  the  economy  actually  operate above  capacity without priceincreases?  There are  a  lot  of  explanations  for why  it  seemingly isoperating above  capacity.  Maybe we do  not have  the  correct  capacitymeasures.  The 85  percent  capacity  that  everybody cites  may no  longerbe applicable in view of  the re-engineering  and the  improved computerand  information systems.  In  any case,  firms  are  adding  to  capacity.There has  been some  discussion  today about  whether we have  the  NAIRUright  at  6 percent  or whether  it  is  plus  or minus  1/2  percentage pointfrom that  level,  and whether  or not  the  unemployment rate  at  5.4percent actually implies that  workers  are more willing  to  move.  Ithink  that  there  is  some  evidence  to  support  the  notion  that  there  ismore  flexibility  in  the  labor market  than  a 5.4  percent  unemploymentrate might  imply.  One can  look at  the  number  of  involuntary part-timeworkers  and the  seemingly higher  losses  in permanent  jobs.  The ECIhas  shown  little wage pressure,  implying that  people  are  concernedabout  their  jobs.  The discontent of  the American  electorate certainlyis  being well  argued at  the  other end of  Pennsylvania Avenue.  Overthe  longer  term,  average  real  wages  have  fallen.  There  is  continueduncertainty about  downsizing.  I do  not  think  that  any of  theseexplanations  is  particularly satisfying, and all  of  us  could mount  apretty good argument  against  any one  of  them.  But we  clearly  seem tobe  at  a stage  of  testing  the  confidence distributions  around  theestimates of  capacity, both  the NAIRU and  the production capacitylevel  of  85  percent.  And while we  are  in  the range  of  testing  thesecapacity levels,  we  clearly are  in  the  inflation  danger zone.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  If  you will pardonthe metaphor,  I would  like  to  see  your praise  of  the change  in  theGreenbook and raise  it.  I thought  the  change  in  the  nature of  thisGreenbook raised  its  usefulness  for  thinking about  policy from next  tozero  to  a quite  considerable  level,  which is  more than a smallincrement.  Not  only  that, but when I read the details,  it  changed myoutlook  somewhat and  I want  to  talk about  that.I prepared my Humphrey-Hawkins projection,  like  all  of you,before  I had  the Greenbook and before  I had  the  staff do  some  furtherwork  that  flowed  from the Greenbook.  I will  talk about  that  in  amoment.  I winged it,  just  like most  of us  do;  and I wrote  down 2-1/2percent  as  my growth  forecast  for  1995,  which  I now  see puts mesquarely  in  the middle  of  the members' projections.  The  Greenbook isat  2.2  percent  for  1995, which  sounds  like  splitting hairs, but  thatassumes  no  further  increase in  interest  rates,  which was  not myguesstimate of what  the FOMC  would  do.  Therefore,  I dutifullyfollowed  the  instructions  and embodied  further  rate  increases  in  theforecast.  So,  the  difference  is  a bit more  than  a split  of  a hair.I must  say that when  I went over  the  details  in  the Greenbookline  by line--consumer durables, producer durables,  the governmentsector,  the works--I  found it  difficult  to  find a piece  of  the GDPthat  I thought would  grow faster  than the  Greenbook  forecast.  I foundit  extremely difficult  to  make  an argument  to  convince myself  thatthings  look better  than  the Greenbook indicates  on  lines  1, 2, 3,  4.That  then  led me  to  the question  of  how I could make  these  numbers  addup  to  growth of  2-1/2  percent.  I think  the reason  that  I was higherhas  to  do with my belief  in a  forward momentum  to  the economy, whichseveral  people  also mentioned,  and I am sure  that  it  colored my view.1/31-2/1/95-98-Belief  in momentum gets  things  right  most  of  the  time,  which  is  why webelieve  in  it.  But  it  always  misses  at  turns;  it  always  under-estimates  turns.  All  of  us  fall  victim  to  that,  including me.  I knowthat  if  I were  doing my Humphrey-Hawkins projections  again today withthe benefit  of  the  Greenbook, I would come  in lower  than  I did about  aweek ago.Choosing between the  two  scenarios  in  the Greenbook  in  termsof preferences  I find an  easy call--I will  come back  to  that  when wetalk about policy--in  that  I would prefer the  baseline scenario.  Letme say what  I mean.  If  I believed  the Greenbook  religiously, giventhe  two choices,  I would like  the baseline outcome a  lot better  thanthe  alternative,  which  I would characterize  as  following the  financialThe  difference between the  two  scenarios  quantitatively,sticking  to positive  economics,  is  the  staff  estimate  of  the  decrementto  GDP growth  from  tighter  money:  some  .3 percent  in  1995  and  1.1percent  in  1996.  I had various  staff members  produce  seven otherestimates  of  that  same  parameter--that  totals  eight.  Mike knows  allthis;  this  is  not  behind his  back.  Those other  seven  estimates wereclustered tightly around  the  1995  number,  averaging a decrement  of  .4instead  of  .3 percent.  For 1996,  while  the  estimates were,  ofcourse, more  spread out,  the  average  was  extremely  close  to  the  1.1percentage point difference  that  you  see  in the  Greenbook.  These areestimates  from  vector auto  regressions  and from  other  largemacroeconometric models.  That  gave me  a lot more  confidence about  thedifference  that policy would make than  I had  10  minutes  after openingthe  Greenbook.  It  convinced me that  that was  about  the best  estimatewe  could make  of  the  decrement  in  GDP growth  from  tighter money.  Thebest  estimate  that we  can make  is  quite different  from saying  that  itis  the  truth,  of  course.The  key question in  front of  us now--that  almost  everybodyaround the  table has  spoken  to  in  their  turn--is how much  of  aslowdown we  can expect without  further  tightening, or  indeed withfurther  tightening.  I  think  there  is  a  strong  consensus, which  Ishare,  that  given our  dual  objectives  we need  a slowdown  from  the  4.0percent  growth  rate  in  1994  to  something no  bigger than  2-1/2  percentand quite  arguably, but  I would say correctly  so,  less  than  2-1/2percent.  The  question  for me is  whether  that  is  in the  cards  and,  ifso,  where  it  is  coming  from.  I think  it  is  coming  from three placesand I want  to  go  over  that.First,  it  is  coming  from the  swing in  inventories.  I findthe  Greenbook forecast  for  inventories very reasonable,  leaving asidethe timing;  nobody has  a  clue about  the  timing,  including Mike and me.Over  the next  four  quarters,  comparing the  fourth quarter of  1994  tothe projection  for  the  fourth quarter  of  1995,  the Greenbook  forecasthas a  swing in  inventories  that  by  itself will  clip  1-1/2  points  offthe GDP growth  rate,  that  is,  comparing  1995  to  1994.Secondly, we  have monetary policy, as  you might have guessed.I asked the  staff  to  answer  the  following question  for me,  and I goteleven different  answers.  These eleven  stem  from using  differenttechniques  to  answer  the  same question.  This  is  the question:Imagine  that,  instead of  easing monetary policy  in 1991  and  1992  andthen holding the  federal  funds  rate  low  in  1993  and tightening policy1/31-2/1/95-99-in  the  last  year,  the  Open Market  Committee had simply  locked  into  aconstant real  federal  funds  rate.  It  simply would not have  gone downand then  come  up.  One  could call  that,  although  I guess  we  don't usethat  term anymore, a  "neutral" monetary policy.  The  reason  I goteleven different estimates  is  that  neutrality can be  defined atdifferent  levels;  it  is  not  obvious where  one puts  neutral.  Also,there  are  different  estimating  techniques having  to  do with differentmacro models  and vector  auto  regressions.  So  I got  eleven differentestimates.  If  you compute  the  effect  of  that difference  in policy ongrowth  in  1994  and growth  in 1995,  you  can  then  subtract one  from theother  and get  an answer  to  the  following question:  What is  thedifference  in  the monetary impulse,  positive or negative, hitting  theeconomy  in  1995 versus  1994?  As  I said,  I have eleven  differentestimates  of  this number.  It  won't  surprise you that  they differquite  dramatically.  The highest  number, which comes  from  the staff'slarge  econometric model,  is  a  subtraction from growth  of  2-1/2percentage points  comparing  1995  to  1994.  The  lowest  number  came  fromthe  Meyer model, which  is  only  1/2  percentage point  lower.  Thesenumbers  were clustered so  that,  if  I did what  was done  to  produce  theHumphrey-Hawkins table  and threw out  the  outliers  and  looked at  thecentral  tendency,  the estimates  of  the decrement  to  growth coming  frommonetary policy would be  concentrated in  the  1 to  1-1/2  percent  range.I conclude  from  that  that using  a number  like  a 1 percent  subtractionis  a quite  conservative,  though not quite minimalist, estimate of  theThe third  factor  that  I add  to  this  list  of  negatives  isMexico;  much in  the  way that  Peter  Hooper  earlier discussed, thatgives  us  a number  in  the range  of  1/4  point.  So,  I add them all  up:1-1/2  percentage points  from  inventories,  1 point  from monetary policyat  the minimum, 1/4  point  from Mexico.  And  that  gives me,  say,  2percent  and not  3 percent, because  it  is  not  correct  to  add them allup;  there has  to  be  some  double-counting in  there.  So,  it  gives me  amental  number  in  the ballpark of  2 percent,  plus  or minus, with plentyof error  I want  to  emphasize, around  that.  Since we are  starting at  4percent,  if  we  subtract  something  like  2 percent,  that  leads me  to  theconclusion that  there  is  a very good chance  that  GDP growth  in 1995will  come in  below 2-1/2  percent  and a reasonable chance  that  it  willcome  in  below 2 percent.  I want  to  remind  you that  that  is  based onthe  Greenbook baseline  of  no  further  tightening, which was  not mypersonal  forecast.  You might  say that  that  is  a very pessimisticattitude.  Now, I come  back to  where  I started.  The outlook  istempered somewhat by the  realization that  the  surprises  to  GDP growththat  we  have had  in  the  last  few quarters have  been coming  inpositive.  In my estimation,  one  ought  not to  ignore  that,  so  Imentally  tend  to  bump up  that  more pessimistic  outlook.  It  leads  meto  the conclusion  that  the  risks  are  about balanced around  a forecastvery much like  the  Greenbook forecast  for  1995.  They had  the numberat  2.2  percent.  I wrote  in  my notes here  between 2  and 2-1/2  percentfor  1995  with quite  symmetric risks  around that.  As  I said,  if  I wereredoing my Humphrey-Hawkins projection now, that  is  what  I would putdown.

MR. BLINDER.  Okay, mark me down.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.On  inflation,  if  we have  overshot  the natural  rate,  as  seems  likely  tome, we  should  get  a slow upcreep  in  inflation,  as  in  the Greenbook,and continuing out  in  further years,  as  in  the  Bluebook.  The analysisin those  two  documents  seemed pretty much on  target  to  me.  Apropos  ofyesterday's  discussion, however,  this will  leave  the  cyclical  peak ofthese  forecasts  for  inflation well  below what  it  reached  in  1990,  andI think that  is  the  right measure  of  progress  on inflation.  I do notaccept  the proposition,  though  I have heard  it  from a  few peoplearound  the  table  today, that  the  measure  of  our  success  is  to keepinflation going down  every single year without  any exception.  When  Iput all  of  that  together,  the  outlook  for  growth  and the  outlook  forinflation  look pretty  satisfactory  to me.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Governor  Kelley mentioned that  it  is  possible  tospin out  two  rather  different  scenarios  concerning  the  economicforecast  at  this  point,  and I agree with him.  In  one  scenario, nosignificant slowdown  is  in  sight  and  the  inflation outlook  is  prettyworrisome.  In  the  second, we  do  have  a slowdown  in  progress.  We  havealready  seen the  first  signs  of  that  and  it  could be  larger  than  theGreenbook  anticipates.  Frankly, at  the moment  I am  losing about  thesame  amount  of  sleep worrying about  each  of  these possibilities.  Ithink the baseline Greenbook  forecast  resolves  the variousuncertainties  in an  extremely sensible way to  come up  with a pointforecast.  It  is  giving  reasonable weight  to  the new data that pointto  a slowdown,  but  it  also  is  maintaining  some  skepticism about  itsmagnitude.  I want  to  convey my  compliments  to  the  chef  on  theforecast  and  I want  to  add my thanks  for having  changed  thepresentation  for which  I am very grateful;  it  also helps me  thinkabout policy.What  I conclude,  though,  is  that  the  risk in the  forecast  hasincreased a lot.  My level  of  uncertainty about where  things  areheaded is  higher than  at  any previous  time  over  the  last  six months.Now,  it  seems  to me  as  I read  the  newspapers  that  the press  is  almostuncritically accepting the  slowdown scenario,  producing new anecdotesin  support  of  that view almost  every day.  I think there are  signsthat  the  economy is  slowing down.  Governor Blinder has  explained whywe  should be  expecting to  see  a slowdown, based on  the  idea  that  westill  have  restraint  in  the pipeline,  and  it  should be making a bigdifference between  1995  and  1994  as  he  explained.  I am not going  toreview  that  reasoning,  but I want  to  comment  about  some  of  theevidence.We  had  a surprising and unanticipated slowdown in  retailsales  in November  and December,  resulting  in consumption  expendituresin  the  fourth  quarter  that were  lower  than  the  Greenbook anticipatedand  inventory accumulation that  was higher.  Governor Lindsey has  been1/31-2/1/95-101-pointing  to  the massive  buildup  in  consumer debt,  which arguably willsoon lead to  some  significant retrenchment.  I think we  could  end upwith a larger inventory cycle  than is  anticipated  in  the Greenbook.Reinforcing the possibility of  a slowdown, we  have  a decline  indurable  goods  orders,  once  defense  orders are  excluded.  It  looks  tome  as  though  those numbers  are  somewhat  consistent with capitalspending growth  at  least  cooling off.  All  the  anecdotal evidence  fromthe  reports  about  home building suggests  that we  have  an  industry thatis  on the  verge  of decline.  We had  a Dodge report yesterday pointingto  a  significant slide  in construction  spending.  We now seeautomobile companies  offering  rebates  on popular models,  loweringproduction plans,  and shutting down assembly  lines  for some periods.Dealer orders  for  inventories  appear  to  have  declined, maybe  becausethe  cost  of carrying them  is  higher now, but maybe  also  becausetraffic  through  showrooms has declined.  On the  international  front,as  Governor Blinder pointed out, we  have  risks  of declines  in ourexports  to  two  of  our most  important  trading partners,  Mexico  andCanada,  with the possibility that  if  the Mexican crisis  harms  otheremerging markets,  our  exports can suffer  there  too.  We  now havepassage  of  a balanced budget  amendment  in  the House and  talk of  fiscalrestraint,  and I certainly do not know where  that  is  headed.  I do notdisagree  in any way with what  the Greenbook has  done  to  produce  apoint  forecast,  but  I see  some  downside risk there,  too.I couple  those negative  demand  side  factors  with  the  factthat  inflation has  been well  contained--running lower  in the  fourthquarter  than  I think  anyone expected, with the  ECI  numbers  suggestingno  significant  evidence of  wage pressures  even in  very tight  laborPhillips  curve models.  I do not  think  there  is  significant reason  tochange  our estimate  of  the NAIRU at  this  stage.  A  couple of  numbersseem to  be off,  but  they are  within the  range of  forecast errors,  so  Iam not yet  buying into  the  idea  that  the NAIRU is  lower  than 6percent.  But that  possibility is  alive  in my mind;  I do not have aclosed mind to  it,  and I don't  think any of  us  should.  I considerthat  a live possibility but  not one  I am yet  ready personally  toendorse.Then I come back  to  the  issue  that  Bob Forrestal mentioned,and I think it  is  important especially given the  lags  in policy.  I donot  want  to  cross  the  barrier  into policy, but we  can ask  just  howhigh  rates  are  at  this  point.  Are  they high or  low by historicalstandards?  I come  out with an  assessment  that  they are  not  low byhistorical  standards.  The  real  fed  funds  rate is  not  low even  givenwhere we  are  in  the  business  cycle.  A  couple  of  years  ago,  JohnTaylor, a Stanford professor who was  a member  of  the  Council  ofEconomic Advisers,  devised  a very simple monetary policy rule  that  Ilook at  to  provide  a rough sense  of whether  or not the  funds  rate  isat a reasonable  level.  One  property of  this  so-called  Taylor rule  isthat  it  is  quite  sensible  in  the  sense  that  it  takes  his  forward-looking  econometric model and  looks  for rules  that perform well.  As  Imentioned yesterday, the  Taylor rule  is  a hybrid rule;  it  is  a policyrule  based on  the  output gap and on deviations  of  an  inflation targetfrom 2 percent.  It  performs well,  but maybe  even more  importantly  itprovides  an  incredibly close  approximation of  the  Fed's reactionfunction since  1986  with the  sole  exception  that  the Fed eased more  in1992  and 1993  and  then tightened more  since  early February 1994  thanthe  rule would have  called  for.  With  the  inflation and output  gaps  at1/31-2/1/95-102-present  levels,  this  rule  right  now would be  forecasting a  funds  rateof  5.1  percent.  Other sensible  rules,  including nominal  GDP  targetingrules  that  we mentioned yesterday, would also be  looking  for a  fedfunds  rate  at  this point  in  the  5 to  5.6  percent range,  so we  are notso  far  from  target.Having  said  all  of  that,  it  seems  to me  that  one  also  coulddiscount most  of  what  I just  said about  the  slowdown.  We  are  alllooking  for  evidence  of  a slowdown,  and  I am worried that  saying weare  there,  as  Cathy  said, may be  wishful  thinking--two  retail  salesnumbers  do  not make  a  trend.  Consumer debt  is  up but  so  is  income,and the  debt  service  burdens of  households  are not rising.  Consumeroptimism  is  high.  Order backlogs  are growing even  if  durable goodsorders have  tapered off,  and the  levels  remain high,  and that  hardlypresages  a downturn  in investment  spending.  Yes,  inventories haverisen a bit,  but  inventory/sales  ratios  are not  high, and  the downsiderisk  from  this  source  is  somewhat  limited.  In any case,  the  Greenbookis  anticipating a decline  in  inventory investment.  The  inventorydownturn would have  to be  still  larger to  create  significant  downsiderisk.  Automobile manufacturers,  of  course, do  not want  sales  to  falloff,  but we  are  counting on  some  slackening  in demand  for  autos.  Withrespect  to  housing,  it  may be  strong because employment  and personalincome have  been growing.  One  could argue  that  seeing will  bebelieving;  we  really have not  seen anything much happen yet  in  spiteof  the  anecdotes.If  I had to  assign probabilities  to  these  two differentscenarios at  the  moment,  I would put  a  .7 on  the  strong scenario  anda  .3 on  the weak one  that  I started with, coming  out  exactly where  theGreenbook does  on balance.  But  the  conclusion I want  to  leave youwith  is  that my level  of  uncertainty has  increased enormously,  and  Ithink  the  potential  forecast error at  this point  is  extremely high.My policy conclusions  follow from  the  idea  that  the  risk at  this pointis  extremely high.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?  If  not,  let  me  justsay what  I think may be  the consensus  of  the  group  that  is  implied  inDon's recommendation.  I think we  successfully brought  the  ranges downto  where  they are  finally consistent with price  stability  in  thecontext of  a restoration of  the  old relatively  stable M2  velocitiesand somewhat  similar M3  velocity relationships.  To  tamper with thatat  this  stage  with no particular purpose would give  signals  that  I donot think we  really have any  intention of  giving.  While  there  is  atechnical  question with respect  to  the possibility of  M3  running  abovethe upper  end of  the range  and hence  the possibility of  going toalternative I-A,  I think Don's  suggestion is  basically a  sensible  one.We  can  certainly make  that  adjustment  in  July if  such M3  growthappears  to  be probable  for this  year.  But  having perhaps  achievedprice  stability nirvana in  terms  of  our  target  ranges,  we have  to  havegood reasons  to  change  them.  Does  anyone  else want  to  speak  on  thisissue?

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Don?  Yes,  Jerry.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Don, one  of  the  alternatives  you gave us  in thetop panel  of  Chart  4 of  the  Bluebook assumes  the NAIRU  is  5-1/2percent.  If  I understand this,  the  line  labeled  "Tighter" is  nottighter  compared to  where we  are.  It  seems  to me  to  be based onmaintaining  the  fed  funds  rate where  it  is.  The bottom  two panelstell  me what  your assumption would  imply for  the CPI  and  the rate  ofunemployment.

MR. KOHN.  I agree  that  that  chart  is  notlong-dash  line  is  the  tighter alternative  from  thecharts.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mike's response  to me  earlier was  that  if  weknew  the  "true" NAIRU  was 6 percent,  that  really means we  can saywith reasonable  confidence  that  it  is  someplace between  5-1/2  and6-1/2  percent.  This  tells  me  that  if  we knew it  truly was  5-1/2percent,  then we  are  really saying  it  is  someplace  between  5 and  6percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  A reasonable  supposition.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I do not  have  a clue  where  it  is,  but  I am  justtrying  to  understand what  these  charts  say.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for  Don?  If  not,  Iwill  start  off  as  usual  on  the policy side.  Coming  out of  the  fourthquarter,  if  we had  seen no  signs  of  slowing or  of  kinks  in  theunbelievable set  of  one-sided data,  I think we would be  in  serioustrouble  at  this  stage.  Fortunately,  there are now  tentative  signs,not necessarily persuasive but  definitely beginning  to  appear,  ofslight  cracks along  the  road.  It  is  crucial  that  those  crackscontinue  to  develop  or we will  have  a serious  problem ahead.I would view the  economic  outlook at  this  stage  as  largely abalancing  of  forces,  with capital  goods  markets,  inventories,  and theso-called interest  sensitive  sectors--housing, motor vehicles, and  soforth--being  the crucial  elements  in  the  outlook.  In  the  capitalgoods  markets,  the  data  are uniformly very  strong.  That  is,  thebacklogs  are  continuing to  rise  as  Governor Yellen mentioned.  We arebeginning  to  see  backlogs  in  the  equipment  area where,  even thoughactual  orders  are  flattening out,  they  are  still  very significantlyabove  the  level  of  shipments and hence  the  forward commitmentscontinue  to  stretch  out.  In  the nonresidential building  area,  startsand permits  clearly are  turning  up  quite significantly.  They areerratic but,  smoothing  through  these  data,  it  is  very obvious  thatthere has  been a rather marked pickup  in nonresidential building.  Onesees  it  also  in  evidence  that prices  of  commercial  real  estate  finallyare  coming  off  their market  lows.1/31-2/1/95-105-As  far  as  capital goods  in  general  are  concerned,  the  cost  ofcapital  continues  to  be  quite  low, and  this  is  consistent with fairlystrong  forward commitments.  The profit  figures  remain quiteextraordinary.  Preliminary estimates  for  the  fourth quarter beingtabulated by Business Week and others  show very strong year-over-yearprofit  figures.  And as  was noted  in Part  II  of  the Greenbook, privateanalysts'  surprises  on the  up  side  are  twice as  large  as  those on  thedown side.  This  is  the  type  of  environment  for the  capital  goodseconomy tilts  down, provided the  financial system does  not interveneand upend  it  in  the  type  of  context  that  Governor Lindsey was  raising,namely, one  where we get  significant wealth destruction  thatimmediately causes  the whole  system  to  readjust.  One  can  say thatwhile  the  stock market  is  not  low, it  clearly  is  not  anywhere  close tobeing as  elevated as  it  was a year or so  ago  in relative  terms.  Wehave  taken  a lot  of  the bubble  out  of  the  market.  Indeed,  I wouldthink one  of  the  successes  of  our  policy to  date  is  that we  have  takenthe degrees  of  instability that  one  can envisage  in  stock prices  downto  a much reduced  level  of  concern.  What  that  does  is  to  feed backinto  the  longer-term outlook  for  capital  goods,  which  is  verydifficult  to  undermine  in any meaningful  way.  Certainly, businessconfidence indexes  look strong;  all  of  them are  on  the upper  side  ofthe ranges  in which  they have  fluctuated.  The  quality spreads withinthe  financial markets  also attest  to  the  fact  that  the  forward riskpremiums  implicit  in  capital  investment are  quite modest.It  is  very difficult  to  find roots  of  a recession  in businesscycle  annals  where  the capital  goods  markets did not  join  in.  So,unless we are  ready to  argue  that  something is  going  to break  in  thosecoming any time  soon.  And with profit  margins not yet  turning down,the  lead  times  that  usually are  associated with this  type  of  marketreally remain quite  extended into  the  future before  any credibledownturn can be presumed.  I leave  out  of  this  the usual  changes  thatwill probably occur  in  the motor  vehicles area.  Class  8 trucks,  thevery heavy duty trucks,  in  general  have been going  flat  out  for  solong  that  there  is  only one way they can go:  One  of  these days  theyare  going  to  tilt  down and that  is  going  to  happen  sometime  this  yearI am pretty sure.On  the  inventory side,  we are  looking at  a very  interestingset  of  data.  There  is  no question,  as a number  of  you have  indicated,that  the  rate  of  accumulation  is  essentially unsustainable.  Thereason basically is  that  the  accumulation is  a much larger ratio  tothe  stock  of  inventories  than  is  typically  the  case, and one  mustassume  that  it  will  slow down.  I leave  the  inventory/sales  ratios  outof  that  for  reasons  I will  get  to.  The problem, however,  in  makingthe  case  for a very major  contraction and an  immediate  impact  on GDPis  that  a substantial  part  of  the  rise  in inventories  has  reflectedimported goods.  The normal  average proportion  of  inventory  changeaccounted  for by  imports  has  been about 17  percent,  say 15  to  20percent.  During  the  last  three quarters  the  share  of  the  total  changein  inventories  coming  from  imports  has been approximately  30  percent.So,  if  we  are  forecasting lower  inventory demand, roughly a third  ofthat  can be presumed  to  involve  imports  that  do  not impact  dollar-for-dollar on  GDP.  I do not think  there  is  any question  that  inventoryaccumulation  is  going to  slow, but  I do  not  see any evidence  tosuggest  that  the  slowdown started  in January because C&I  loans,  which1/31-2/1/95-106-have been a reasonably good estimator  of  book value  changes,  ifanything look  stronger  since  the end of  the  year.  And there  is  noanecdotal  evidence  to  suggest  that  inventories  are  backing up and  thatthese  loans  are  financing unintended accumulations.  So, while  thereis  the presumption  that  liquidation or  slow growth  in  inventories  isabout  to  occur,  it  is  still  a forecast  and  it  does  not show up  in anyof  the data with which we  tend to  work.  More  important  is  the  factthat  the  level  of  inventories remains  low.  One can  see  this  in  anumber  of ways  other  than  the obvious  inventory/sales  ratios.  One wayis  to  take  the  domestically produced  inventories,  leaving  out  theestimated imported inventories,  as  a ratio  to  domestic  sales.  Thatratio  is  quite low and  is  actually still going  down.  These are  theinventories  that  have  a direct  impact  on domestic production andemployment.Secondly,  and this  is  not an  independent observation,  theratio  of  inventories  to  output,  after trade markups are  subtracted,  isstill very low and does not  show any uptilt  at  all.  We  have discussedthis  previously:  If you  are  looking  for  inventory  overhang,  thequestion  is  not  the  constant-dollar  total value  of  inventories  that  isrequired  for estimating  the national  income,  but how many units  ofinventory are  out  there.  It  doesn't matter  so  far  as  domestic  shoeproduction is  concerned--to whatever extent we  still manufactureshoes--whether  the  shoes  in  inventory are  at  the  retail  level  or  atthe  factory shipping point.  At  the retail  level  they are  a muchlarger  dollar  figure in  the  inventory  figures,  but  that  markup doesnot matter.  There  is  very  little  evidence  at  this  stage  that we  haveaccumulated levels  of  inventory that  have  to be  readjusted.  I thinkthat  is  going  to  occur at  some  point and  it  may very well  be  thetrigger of  the next  downturn, but  it  is  not  here,  at  least  not yet.What  we  see,  as we would ordinarily expect,  is  that  the  lead  times  ondeliveries  of materials  are still  quite  long.  There is  pressure  onfacilities  as  a consequence  of  that,  and we are also  seeing varioustypes  of  shortages,  all  of  which underscore  the  fact  that  inventoriesare  low  and that  there  is  very  little unintended  inventoryaccumulation in  the  pipeline.  I might  say, however,  that  it  ispossible  from  a  statistical point of  view to  get  a very sharpreduction  in  the  rate  of  inventory accumulation, and hence asignificant  decline  in  the rate  of  GDP  growth, that  does not  getcaptured fully  in  the  import  data because  there  is  too much noise  inthe data.  So we may actually get  a much  lower GDP  increase  in one  ofthe next  several  quarters  than we  currently  expect,  and certainly  lessthan  is  projected in  the Greenbook, but  it  may be more  a statisticaldiscrepancy question  than any  real  economic phenomenon.In  the  interest-sensitive areas,  where  housing  starts  are thebiggest  item,  single-family  starts  are probably being held up  by smokeand mirrors.  The  current  level  is  hard to  believe  even with all  thearguments with  respect  to  income and the  like.  I think  it  is  almostinevitably going  to  come  down and will  be the  biggest  item, I wouldsay,  in an aggregative  sense  that we will  have  in holding down thegrowth rate  in  final  demand.  Sales  of  existing homes also  will  befalling significantly.  That  in  turn will  tend  to  reduce  the  capitalgains  realized  on  the  sale  of  homes  and will  contract  spending in  theretail  areas because  a  substantial amount  of  the  realized capitalgains,  which  are essentially  financed by increases  in mortgage  debt,goes  into  consumer markets.  Part  of  Larry Lindsey's concern  is  thatthe  household debt  numbers  are  already quite  large  and hence  a sort  of1/31-2/1/95-107-double-whammy effect  will probably  soften retail  sales  to  some  extent.I should say,  however,  that  while  it  is  mixed there  is  evidence  thatmotor vehicle  sales  were  down  in January;  I gather  that  we have  to  bevery careful  about  the official  January  figures because  there  is  a newmethod  for reporting when the  cutoff  for monthly sales  occurs.  Fromwhat we  can gather  from the  Johnson Redbook and  the Mitsubishi  generalmerchandise  surveys,  January soft  good sales  are  actually quitestrong.  So,  it  is  not by any means  clear  that  the  retail  salesquarter.  I do  think, however,  that we  should not expect--in fact weshould not  hope  for--strong retail  sales  in the next  couple of  monthsbecause  if  we do  get  that,  then  the notion  that  the  expansion isslowing  becomes very seriously  in doubt.The  other  data  that we have  for the  January period are  allconsistent with the view that  the  economy has  not  shown very much inthe way of  a slowdown.  There  is  some  evidence.  I think motorvehicles  and housing  starts probably are  the major areas  where theslowdown will occur.  But  initial  claims are  still quite  low.  Insuredunemployment  looks  to  be quite  low, really  at  the bottom  of  recentranges.  Certainly, when one  looks  at  the  credit data,  it  is  verydifficult  to  find any evidence  that  monetary  tightening isconstraining  debt  flows.  Consumer credit  restraint  seemingly is  goingout  of  style.  If  Larry Lindsey is  right,  there will  be more creditcards--did you say  two  offers per day are  now coming  in,  Larry?

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Moving up  toward  two per day, yes!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thanks  to  Ricki!  [Laughter]  C&I  loansare  just  extraordinary.  Consumer  loans  extended by commercial banks,especially when securitization  is  added back in,  are  also  remarkable.And apparently we  are  still  getting some  easing  in  credit  terms,  whichseems  to  suggest  that bankers  have not been  told about  our monetarypolicy tightening!  This  is  an unusual  phenomenon this  late  in  thebusiness  cycle.  So,  the presumption  that monetary restraint  is  takinghold in any material way at  this  stage  is  not  self-evident  in  thiscase.  As  both Janet Yellen and Cathy Minehan pointed out,  when wehave a policy of  trying  to  achieve a soft  landing, we  have  to becareful  that  wishful  thinking  does  not  overcome  our better  statistics,if  I may put  it  that way.  There  is  a possibility that  the  expansioncould slow  fairly quickly and  if  that were  to  happen, granted the verystrong  capital  goods markets  and especially if  inventory investmentfell  quickly to  a new adjusted  level,  the  second half  of  this yearcould be  stronger  than the  first.  That  obviously presupposes  that  thefirst  half  turns  out  to  be weaker  than  expected.  What  I find verydifficult to  envisage  is  a smooth  adjustment  the way it  is  in  theGreenbook.  There  is  one very  important  reason.  It  has never happenedthat  way.  The  Greenbook of necessity has  to  provide  smooth forecasts.So,  something different  is  going to  happen  this  particular  time.  Solong as  capital  goods  markets hold and are not undercut, we probablywill  have  reasonably solid growth;  but because  of  the  inventorysituation, as  Governor  Blinder pointed out,  we  have  a really goodpotential  to  bring the  rate of  growth down  to  moderate  levels whichfor want  of  a better  term pushes  the  economy  toward  a soft  landing.Having  said all  of  that,  an  argument  can be  made  to  staywhere we  are  at  this particular  time.  That  argument would haveconsiderable  force were  it  not  for  the  fact  that  the  markets  expect  a1/31-2/1/95-108-50  basis point  rise  in  the context  of  an exchange market  for  thedollar  that  has not been  all  that  impressive.  We know that  to  theextent we choose  to go  against  market  expectations,  we  create  a degreeof  volatility;  indeed,  that  is  the purpose  of  going against  thewere we  to  hold still  at  this  point,  we  would in my view be  takingunnecessary and undue risks.  The  risk on  the  exchange rate  side  isthat  the  dollar would undoubtedly  fall.  The problem is  not  so much  athe  way world markets  have been behaving, where  countries  that  areviewed  as  slightly suspicious  find the  foreign  exchange vigilantesrunning at  them.  The  United States  is  just  barely  investment  grade,if  I may put  it  that  way.  I don't  think we have  much leeway on  thedown side  to  take  those  risks.So,  in my judgment,  raising both  the  funds  rate  and thediscount  rate by 50  basis points  makes  the most  sense.  I  think therisks  are  relatively small,  especially since  such  tightening is  soheavily discounted.  But we have  to  be  a little careful.  Whensomething  is  so  fully discounted as  the  50  basis points  that  ispresumed here,  the normal  assumption  is  that  markets will  not  adjust.That  is  not  true.  There are  a lot  of  people  who play on  both sides  ofthis  and there will  almost  invariably be  some  adjustments.  Frankly,it  is  unclear  to me where  they are  going  to  come  from.  I wish  thebond market had not been so  strong  for  the  last  two  days  because  onepossibility  is  that we will  get  a bond market  selloff  in  line  with theprinciple  that you buy  on  the expectation  and sell  on  the news.  Thistype  of  rally suggests  to  me  that  if  we move up  50  basis points  it  isnot  self-evident  that  bond markets  are  going  to be  firm because  oftheir  pattern over  the  last  two days.  What  I think is  reasonablycertain  is  that  if  we  do not move now, we will  have  the  makings of  alittle nervousness  in  these  markets,  and that  is  something which in myview doesn't make  any  sense  for  us  to  foster at  this point.Let me  end there  and just  note  that  having said all  I saidabout  tightening, granted how I see  the  economic outlook,  I think wewill  be  truly symmetric  if we  raise  the  federal  funds  rate  to  6percent.  It  is  by no  means evident  that  if  this  cracking  that  we haveseen continues  and mushrooms  in  one  form or  another,  there will beanother  tightening of policy.  I'm not  saying  that  there will  not be;but while we  could see  that  we had  a way to  go when we moved back inAccordingly, I would  suggest  thinking  in terms  of  going  to symmetry  ifwe move  50  basis points.  I have held  forth  a little  longer  than  Iintended.  Who would  like  to  speak next?  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I am in  full  agreement  with what yourecommend.  The  only  thing  I would add  is  that  I would accompany  thatincrease  in  the  funds  rate with an  increase  in  the discount  rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'm sorry,  I thought  I said that.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I'm  sorry, I missed  it.  My reasons  are much thesame;  let  me  just  quickly  tick them  off.  First  of  all,  in my view wemust  continue  to  restrain  the growth  in  the monetary  aggregates  toensure that  incipient  inflationary pressures are  contained and  thatprogress  is  made  toward price  stability.  Secondly,  though  the  growthin  the narrow aggregates has  been very  slow over  the  last  year,  their1/31-2/1/95-109-behavior must  be  evaluated in  light  of  the very rapid growth  rates  in1991  through  1993.  In  addition,  as  the Bluebook notes,  two  factorsare  estimated to have  depressed M1  growth by about  3 percentage pointsin  1994.  Both of  those  I think  argue  for continued restraint.  Whilean argument  can always be made  to  wait for more  information, ourcredibility in  fixed  income and  foreign exchange markets  is  fragile  inmy judgment.  That would be very consistent with what you  said, Alan.An imminent  action  is  widely expected.  Failure  to  move now mightresult in  adverse  consequences  for  the  economy, especially  ifsubsequent information supported continued strong demand and risingprices  as  I think is  likely.  Finally,  I would note  that  the  currentaccount  deficit  is  rising and will  approach  $200  billion in  1995  basedon the Greenbook  forecast.  This makes  it  all  the more  important  thatwe  focus  on maintaining  the value of  our currency by keeping inflationlow.  I don't  think  it  happens  very often that  I can do this,  but  thatmaintaining  investment grade, Alan.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I also  am  in  full  agreement with yourrecommendation.  I meet with people  from a lot  of  the mutual  fund andmoney management  organizations prior  to  coming to  Federal  Open MarketCommittee  meetings  just  to  get  a sense  of where  they think the marketsare.  This  time  they were very strongly  tilted toward an  expectation,as you  all  know, that we  would move by something  like  50  basis points.There  would be  a good  deal  of  surprise  if  we did not.  It  is  not  thatwe necessarily want  to  have  a policy that  follows  the markets, but  Iam in  total  agreement with your view that  there  is  a volatility  issueto be  considered.  President Forrestal  hit on a key point and  that  isthe  issue of  knowing when and how  to  stop  the policy tighteningprocess.  I am  a bit concerned about  that.  I think  50  basis pointsputs us  on a  trajectory that  is  roughly halfway between the  baselineand the  alternative scenario.  It  is well  within what we  in Bostonwere projecting in  terms  of  our Humphrey-Hawkins  targets.  I agreethat  the risks  would be balanced and I agree with  symmetry, but  I hopewhen we see  things  begin  to  slow down  that we will be  as  forward-looking on  the way down  as  we have been  on the way up  and  sensitive  toknow when  to  stop  tightening and perhaps  even when to  back off.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I support  your proposal  fully, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let  me  just  say that  I agree with CathyMinehan.  I think  the point  she has  made probably should be  in  thefront  of  our minds at  every meeting  for  the next  few meetings  becausewe made a big case  of being up  front on  the  tightening side.  If  weseriously believe that  there  is  a long  lead time,  while we may say ourbroad approach  should be  asymmetric  in  the sense  that  we are phasingtoward price  stability,  it  still  implies  that we  should move ahead ofthe curve  where there  is  the necessity  to  do so.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I agree with your analysis  and with yourpolicy conclusion, Mr. Chairman.  If  one  looks  at  the Greenbook'sbaseline  forecast,  and indeed at  our  Bank's baseline  forecast,  theresult  is  not bad at  all.  It  is  fairly acceptable,  although one  couldargue perhaps  that  the  inflation rate  looks  a bit high.  The problem1/31-2/1/95-110-with  that  forecast  is  that we  have  seriously underestimated thestrength of  this  economy for  a long  time,  and  the risk  is  that  we willcontinue  to do  so.  So,  I think it  is  wise  for us  to  take  out aninsurance policy, if  I can put  it  that  way, to  make sure  that we doget  the deceleration  that  is  required  in this  economy.  I wouldsupport your  funds  rate  recommendation and also your recommendationabout  symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, I think  there  is  urgency in  theneed to  tighten policy  for  many of  the  reasons  that  have beenmentioned here.  Clearly,  the analysis  in  the  Greenbook and  ouranalysis  in San Francisco  support  the  need to  tighten policy.Therefore,  I would favor  a 50  basis point  increase.  Quite  frankly,the work we  do--and I think  it  is  implicit  in  the  Greenbook as  well--suggests  that  additional  tightening probably will  be  needed  in  thefuture.  Consequently,  I would prefer asymmetric  language, but  Icertainly could live  with symmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Mr. Chairman, you  and I have  discussed this  atsome  length.  As  you know,  I have become  firmly convinced as  a resultof  those discussions  that  this would be  a great  time  to wait  for a  fewweeks,  and I want  to  explain why.  The  key question to  me  is  implicitin what  we were  talking about  before.  If  we  stop  here,  at  5.5  percenton  the  funds  rate, would we--by,  say,  the  end of  1996  plus  or minus--be back to  a zero  inflationary gap?  I  think we probably have  overshotand we  need to  get back.  So  that  is  the  crucial  question.  It  dependson three  things:  how  fast we  think the  economy  is  likely to  grow overthe next  two years;  where we  think the  NAIRU is;  and what  we  think thepotential growth  rate  is.  On  the  latter,  I accept  the  staff'sanalysis.  On the  forecast,  I am very  close to  the  staff's  analysis,and on  the NAIRU I am pretty close also.  I would  shade  the NAIRU atad  to  the  low side  of  their  estimate, but  that  is  not a majordifference.  As  I weigh all  those  factors,  plus  the  standard errorsaround  them, which are  substantial  in many cases,  the odds  seem to  meless  than  50/50  that  we will  in  fact  eradicate the  inflationary gap bythe  end of  1996--less  than  50  percent  but better  than,  say,  20-25percent.  So,  you might  ask, doesn't  that  mean  I should advocate anincrease  in  rates  right now?Three  things  tell me  it  would be better  to  wait.  The  firstis  what  I would characterize  as  a glimmer,  or  a whiff,  of  an  imminentslowdown.  I want  to  emphasize both  of  those words.  I don't  think  itis  more  than  a whiff.  I think there  is  a very  good chance--as you  doMr. Chairman--that  this  is  in  fact  a  false negative;  and when we havesome more  data, we will  see  if  that  was  the  case.  But  the  other wordI want  to  stress  is  that  it  is  a whiff  of an  imminent  slowdown;  it  isnot  a whiff of  a slowdown  a year  from now.  If  in fact  the whiff isaccurate,  it  would be  a mistake  indeed  to  be  still  raising  rates atthis  point.  That  is  a minor part  of  the problem;  I do not  think  thatis  the major  possibility.The  reason  I would like  to  wait,  though  I can  see  that  thatis  not  going  to  be the  outcome  of  this meeting,  is  that  in just  twoweeks we  will  have another  employment report  and  inflation reports  at1/31-2/1/95-111-both  the wholesale and consumer  levels.  Also,  and most  important tome at  this  juncture  in  time  for  exactly the  reasons  you said, Mr.Chairman, though not usually that  important  to  me,  is  that we  willhave  one  more month of  retail  sales  data.  For me,  that will  convey alot  of  information about whether  the data  for November and Decemberwere an  aberration, a  fluke  in  the  data  for  the  Christmas season,  oran  indication of  something real  going  on in  the  economy of  which weare  just  seeing  the beginnings.  That  is  the major  factor.Two  other  factors  are  international.  One has  to  do with thesituation in Mexico,  which  says  to me:  Why throw another match  intothe  oil  at  this point?  I felt  that  way much more  firmly Monday than  Ido  now since  something has  actually happened on  the Mexican front.But  I think  it  would be  ludicrous  to  say,  and nobody would, that  theMexican situation has now settled  down.  That  is  very  far  from  thecase.  While  it  is  true,  as  Peter  said before,  that  50  basis points  isnothing between  friends  if  the  friends  live  on  opposite  sides  of  theRio Grande,  the  direction  is  clear.  It  is  not  going to  help.Similarly,  if we  go north  of  the border, we have  the  Canadiansstruggling  to  keep up with  the  Federal Reserve--and not  verysuccessfully for  a while.  My guess,  by  the way, would be  that  theywill more  than match our  rate  increase;  but that  increase  certainly isgoing  to  exacerbate  the problems  of  our  northern neighbor.If  the  domestic  factors  alone were making  an  overwhelmingcase  to  tighten now--that  is,  if  I believed, for  example,  as  Bob Parrysaid, that  there  is  an  urgent  need to  tighten  now--I  would just  say,"I am  sorry Canada;  I am  sorry Mexico;  we work  for  the Americans,  andthat  is  just  too  bad."  But  I do not  see  the case  as  urgent.  I seethe  case  as  rather  more finely balanced.  We have  just  experienced agood inflation  surprise in  the  fourth  quarter.  Almost  all  theinflation surprise of  1994  came  in  the  fourth quarter.  That  says  tome,  first  of  all,  that  things  are more balanced and  the  inflationaryrisks are  less  than I might  otherwise think.  In an  atmosphere likethat,  these  international considerations push me  further towardwaiting.  I want  to  emphasize that  I am not talking  about waitinguntil  the next FOMC  meeting necessarily.  This  is  a  case where  in justtwo weeks, we will  have a significant  quantum of  new data.  If  thosedata  refute  the hypothesis  of  an  imminent  slowdown--and I think  theprobability  is  better  than  50/50  that  they will--I  would be  fullyready to  support  an  increase  in  interest  rates.  On  the  other hand  ifthey do not,  I would be pushing very strongly  for us  to  put  ourpistols  in  our holsters  for  a while.The  only  argument  I can see  for moving  today, and you madeit,  Mr. Chairman,  is  that  the markets  are  strongly expecting  it.  Thatis  true;  I do not  dispute  that.  The markets  are  indeed expecting it.The  only place  I would differ  is  that  I do not  take  that  as  animportant  consideration governing what we  actually do.  That wouldseem to  me like being  led around by  the markets much too much.  As youknow--we  started  talking  about  this,  I guess, on  Friday--I  have beenwrestling a great  deal  over  the question  of  whether  this  is  animportant  enough difference  to  merit  a dissent.  I finally decided  itis  not.  The  basic outlook  that  you  just  outlined, and  the  sort  ofmedium-term strategy you have  in mind  for  the FOMC,  is  not  verydifferent  from mine.  This  is  a  tactical  difference.  I do  feel  verystrongly  that  it  would be  wiser, more prudent  indeed, to  wait  a coupleof  weeks.  But,  first  of  all,  you might be  right and  I could be wrong.1/31-2/1/95-112-Nobody can be  sure  about  that.  Furthermore, as  I said, I do  think  theodds  are better  than 50/50  that  the  outcome  of  the wait  for  two  weekswill  be  just  to  do  two weeks  later what you  are  proposing to  do  today.So,  I am willing  to  go  along.  I nonetheless would like  to  lay downthe marker  that  I think  the chances  may be  one  out  of  three, orsomething  like  that,  that  we are now  in  the process  of  setting  thethermostat  too  low  out of  impatience  that  the  room did not  cool  downas  fast  as  we wanted  it  to.  It  is  going to  take  some considerableevidence  to  get me  to  support  another  interest  rate  increase  againanytime  soon.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  the  preponderance of  evidence  thatwe have  reviewed  confirms  that  the  economy continues  to  grow  fasterthan  its  potential.  We  expect  this  will  contribute  to  a perceptibleincrease  in  inflation despite  the unexpectedly low inflation  ratesobserved toward  the  end of  last  year.  Some moderation  of  real  growthrates  does  appear  likely by midyear as  a result  of  our earlieractions.  Nonetheless,  the  adoption of  a somewhat  contractionarymonetary policy  is  warranted  in  order to  prevent  the  anticipatedinflationary pressures  from  generating a permanent  increase  in  theinflation rate.  With  the  real  fed funds  rate  in  the  2-1/2  to  3percent  range,  consistent with a policy  stance  that  is  only mildlycontractionary,  this  suggests  that  further  action  is  appropriate.These considerations  lead me to  support  your  recommendation for  a 50basis point  increase  in  the  fed  funds  rate  and also a  symmetricdirective.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman,  strictly  on  the basis  of  domesticconsiderations,  I would associate myself  with Governor  Blinder  for  thereasons  he  stated and for  another  one.  We  are  going  to  be  finding outnot  only  retail  sales;  we  are  going  to  have both  the Administration'sbudget  and Mr.  Gingrich's budget unveiled  in  the next  two  weeks.  Ithink the  reactions  to  that  will  answer  some  of  our questions  aboutfiscal  policy.  I do not  know about  the  quality of  the  answers,  but atleast  that  will  light  a match  in  an  otherwise completely dark room.  Ithink your observations  on  the  international  side  are well-taken.  Thecase  against  waiting--I am  going  to  flip  the nuances  of  the  wayGovernor Blinder  said  it--is  that  if  we had a compelling reason  to  goone  way or  the  other  domestically, we  should do  it.  If,  however, wewait  and we have  a crack in  the dollar  in  the  next  two weeks,  theamount  of  tightening we would have  to  do  in  order to  counteract  thatcrack would be  a lot  more  than  50  basis points.  So,  given  that  thereis  some  uncertainty about  the domestic  scene,  I view a  50  basis pointincrease as  probably buying us  some  insurance  that we  will  not  have  totighten  further.  And  so,  I can very much  support your proposal.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I think  this  decision really  comes  down toassessing the  risks  and one's  comfort  level  in  dealing with those1/31-2/1/95-113-risks.  Your analysis  of  the  risks,  Mr. Chairman,  on the  domesticeconomy  is  about as  good an assessment  as  one  can get.  The  risksstill  do  favor,  I think, the  continuation  of  too much  strength and,given where  we are  in  the cycle,  greater risk on  the  inflation side.Given that,  I think we would be  doing the  right  thing  and my comfortlevel would be  increased by  following your recommendation of  going up1/2  percentage point.  I would  like  to  join others,  however, and saythat  I think the way monetary policy has been conducted over  the pastyear  is  one  of  the  high points  in  this  Committee's  history, at  leastthe part  that I have been associated with.  It has been that  waybecause we have been  forward-looking, but we also have  been willing  tobe decisive when we needed  to be.  We need  to  continue  to  be  forward-looking in  this part  of  the  cycle.  While  I am sympathetic  to  thenotion  that  there  are more  data  coming, that  is  always going  to  be  thecase.  More  often than  not we get  into  trouble  by waiting  for  one morepiece  of  data.  We  tend to  make  the  right decision when we  take theinformation that  we have  in hand, make  the best  judgment we can, andthen go  for  it.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I support your  recommendations  fora 1/2  percentage point  increase  and a symmetrical  directive.  I wouldlike  to  say that  whether or not  we move  now  is  based on whether wethink it  is  prudent  on the basis  of  the evidence.  The preponderanceof  the evidence  I heard  today and your arguments  suggest  to  me  thatmoving now is  appropriate.  I am  sensitive,  too,  to whether  we  areforward-looking  or not, but  there  is  one nuance  in  terms  of  whatGovernor  Blinder said  that  is  important as  well.  That  is,  if  we waitbecause we  have  this whiff  of  a  slowdown and if  we  are  reasonablyconvinced that  there  is  increasing inflation  in  train, we  will  comeperhaps  to  the point where we  get  just  another whiff with a  littleincrease  in  inflation and  find ourselves  asking what we should  do now.It will be harder  to make the move  then because we will  have bothrising  inflation  and this  whiff of  a slowdown at  the  same  time.  So,  Ithink now is  the prudent  time  to move.  A move will  help staunchinflation going forward.  I think buying  the  insurance now  and headingoff  further  inflation and a  larger move  later,  as  Governor  Lindseysaid,  is  the  right  thing  to  do.  I support you.

MR. STERN.  I support  the  recommendations.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I would  like  to  associate  myself  fully withGovernor Blinder's  analysis and also  with  the  conclusions  that he  drewfrom it.  As  I indicated, I think  the  forecast  risk is  very high atthe moment,  and I also  agree  that  more data would be helpful  inwould favor  a further  50  basis point  increase  in  the  funds  rate.  Ifwe knew that  we needed  that  increase  in  the  funds  rate,  I do  agreethat  sooner  is  better  than  later.  On the  other hand, a  short delayimposes  only a very minimal  cost.  I do not  think we  should  feelcompelled  to  raise  the  funds  rate today,  and I do  see definitebenefits  from waiting a  little  longer  to  decide.  I fear  that  if  weact  today, our move may turn  out  to  be one we will  regret.  I realize,1/31-2/1/95-114-of  course,  that  if  we wait  another  few weeks  as  Governor  Blindersuggested, we will  see  further  data  that  I would definitely  like  tosee:  an additional  retail  sales reading,  another  employment  report,and  some  further  CPI  and PPI  numbers.  I would like  to  see  anotherhousing starts  number and some  auto sales  numbers  as  well.  In mymind,  this would reduce my uncertainty about which of  the  scenarios  isthe  right  one.  That  is  why I favor waiting, not at  all  until  the  nextmeeting but  just  for a few weeks,  to  look at  those  data.I understand that  there  is  an expectation  on the  part of  thethink that  should force us  to  move today.  The market's  expectation,which I read as a further  150  basis points  increase before we  stoptightening policy, does not coincide with my own.  On  the  basis  ofcurrent  information, I am envisioning only this  50  basis pointincrease.  Given what  I know about  the  economy and the  uncertaintythat  I have  about  the natural rate,  it  would take a lot  of newinformation for me  to  contemplate  going up  150  basis points.  That  ispart  of  the  reason why I mentioned  the Taylor rule,  to  give us  a senseof  where we  think the  funds  rate  should be.  I find  that many people  Italk to  reason as  follows:  As  long as  actual growth exceeds growth  inpotential  output--that  is,  as  long  as  the  economy  is  growing  fasterthan,  say, 2.5  percent--the funds  rate  should be  raised.  Sometimes  Ifind myself  falling  into  that pattern  of  thinking,  too--that  theeconomy  is  growing  too  quickly and  that means  we  should tighten  somemore.  But  this  is  a crazy way of  thinking,  and  it  definitely runs  therisk  of  ending up with  too much tightening.  We can move 25  basispoints  or  50  or  75  basis points  each time,  and that  is  the  way we  endup with overkill.  That  is  why I think we have  to  have  a sensiblenotion of  the  right  level  toward which we  should be  heading.  And wehas  one way of  coming at  what  that  level  should be--7  percent.  I donot disagree with the  Greenbook strategy.  But the  Taylor rule  and  theother rules  that were distributed to  you call  for a rate  in the  5percent range, which is  where we already  are.  Therefore,  I am notimagining another  150  basis points.In spite  of  having said  that my  choice would be  to wait,  Iintend to  vote for your proposal.  The  reason is  that  I think thedifferences  that we  have  largely concern tactics  and not  strategy.  Myguess  is  that,  while  I would prefer to  wait,  the probability is  highthat  in  three weeks  I would want  to  go  along, that  I too would prefera 50  basis  point increase.  I also  grant that my views  on tacticscould be wrong and, therefore,  I do not  intend  to  dissent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I verymuch agree with your conclusion, but  I would  like to  state  justbriefly  some  of  the  reasons.  Every possible conjuncture that we havebeen  able  to put  together  on the  economy  indicates  that we need toincrease  official rates by 50  basis points--possibly by more  thanthat,  but certainly by 50  basis  points.  Therefore, just  on  theeconomics,  I think  the  time  to  raise  those  rates  is  today, and  I donot  have to  justify the  increases  in my own mind by  the  fact  thatfinancial  markets  clearly are  looking for  a 50 basis point  increase.I do  think that market expectations  are  a substantiating reason butperhaps  from a slightly different perspective.  It  is  reasonably1/31-2/1/95-115-likely in  my view that  this  will be  the  last  interest  rate  increase.It  is  important  that  we  do  it  decisively and  that we not gratuitouslycreate a problem  in financial markets,  especially at  a  time when  Ithink the  dollar  is  extremely vulnerable  and  likely to  fall.  Thereare  going  to  be  two  times,  possibly this year  and maybe  even probablythis year, when we will  disappoint  financial markets.  The  first willbe  at  the meeting  at  which  they expect  us  to  increase interest ratesand we  do  not,  especially if  we  accompany the decision, going back  toour discussion at  yesterday's meeting, with a  statement  that we  havebe  ready  for  that.  We will  disappoint  them even more when we decidethat  it  is  appropriate to  reduce interest  rates  at  a time whenunemployment probably will  be below anybody's  notion  of  the NAIRU andwhen we  could be having  some uptick  in inflation.  That  forward-looking move, which I  think will  take  at  least  as  much courage  as  anyof  the moves  that we made  last year  or  contemplate for  today, willinduce much confusion  in  financial  markets.  I would much ratherconfine  the  confusion  to  those  two  important  times  and not  cause  itthis  time  for,  I think, no  earthly benefit  for us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  If  we currently enjoyed a situation where  therewas  no  uncertainty on  the  outside  about  our intent  to  deliver  a lowerinflation rate  in  the years  ahead, regardless  of  what happens  in  1995,and  to  move  toward ultimate price  stability, then I would not movetoday.  Because we  do not  have  that  kind of  credibility, because  thereis  uncertainty about  our  policy objectives, because  our  staff  andprivate  forecasters  have  inflation going up--the  last OECD  forecastthat  I saw had  the United States with  the highest  inflation  in  the  G-7--and because  of  the  dollar  situation, I think  that we  are  forced toerr  on  the  side  of  tightness  whether this  is  to  be  the  last  tighteningmove or not.  Without  those  things,  I would not  even do  this  today.But with those  things  I think we  are  forced to  continue marching  in away that may  turn  out  to  be  too much tightening.

In  spite of  the  recentannouncements,  that  situation is  likely to  be uncertain for  quite  awhile.  It  is  quite  conceivable that  this  tightening move may be  allthat  is  needed.  But  in view of  the  strength  of  the  economy,  it  seemsto  me  that  the risk  of  overshooting  is  minimal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Before we  go  to  lunch,  I want  to  read,in  line with our discussion yesterday, the proposed press  release  onthe  discount  rate  increase;  the vote was  7 to  zip.  After  the usuallisting of  the  Banks  that  already have proposed  50  basis pointincreases,  the  operative  language  in  this  announcement would read  asfollows:  "Despite tentative  signs  of  some moderation  in growth,economic  activity has  continued  to  advance  at  a substantial pace,while  resource utilization has  risen  further.  In these  circumstances,the  Federal  Reserve  views  these  actions  as  necessary to  keep  inflationcontained and  thereby  foster sustainable economic  growth."  Unlessthere  are any  objections to  that, we  will  continue  the meeting buthave  lunch and  turn the  agenda over  to  Ted Truman to  continue ourdiscussion of  the Mexican  situation.[Meeting recessed]

Obviously,  if  any ofyou have  further questions  about what  we discussed yesterdayafternoon, I will  be  glad to  try to  answer  them.  Let me preface thatby saying  that  there probably will be  some  questions  for which myanswers  will  have  to be  less  than perfect.  But  I would like  to  try  toanswer  any that  you have and  either  stop  there, Mr. Chairman,  or moveon  to  the  two proposals  that  I mentioned yesterday.  I am  at  yourdisposal,  including whether you want me  to  cover  the proposalsindividually or  together.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey is  first.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  I have  two questions.  The  first has  to  do withthe responsibility  that  we might have  to monitor  the  agreement.  It  iswidely believed on Capitol  Hill  that  the  reason  to vote  for  this  isthat  the  Federal Reserve  will  be monitoring Mexican monetary policy.In  addition,  the  IMF  released a statement  yesterday  saying that  theFederal  Reserve  along with  the  IMF will  monitor developments  closelyduring  the next  six months.  Would you tell  us what  our responsibil-ities  are  to monitor an  agreement  that  has not been reached yet  andwhose  terms  we don't  know?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I will  do  the  best that  I can!  On  the  firstpart  of  your question,  the  legislation that  was going  to  be proposedbut which  is  now  dead made reference  to  the Federal  Reserve  in  severalrespects.  I skipped  over that  yesterday  afternoon because  thoseprovisions were  no  longer  relevant,  having been overtaken by events.They related basically  to  Mexico's  monetary policy and the  widespreadview on Capitol  Hill  that  it  is  the  source  of  Mexico's problem.  Somewould say  it  is  the  exclusive source  of  Mexico's problem.  We werementioned in  the  legislation  in  terms  of  a requirement that  the Bankof  Mexico  provide us  with data  and information on  their policies.  Wealso were mentioned  in  connection with the preparation of  variousquarterly or  semi-annual  reports  regarding the progress  of  the programthat  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury, in  consultation with us  and otherrelevant  government agencies, was  to  submit  to  Congress.  Since  thereis  no  longer any  legislation,  that  in some  sense  is  not  relevant,though  I would imagine  that we will  have  to  provide  some reports  toCongress,  if not by formal mandate  at  least  in connection withoversight hearings.As  for  the  statement  in  the  IMF Managing Director's  pressrelease yesterday, I confess  that  it was  somewhat of  a  surprise to  mesince Bill McDonough  and I had been consulted and we  thought  it  hadbeen  removed.  When I got back  to my office yesterday evening  and sawit  in  the materials  that  I had handed out  to  you,  it  was a  surprise to1/31-2/1/95-118-me.  I checked on  this  and apparently  the  reason  it  was  in  there  isnot  unrelated  to  the  first  question--

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Our good friends  at  the  Treasury apparently  feltthat  the  statement was needed  for  two  reasons.  Now,  I am  interpretingtheir motives  or putting forth hypotheses  about  their motives  becauseI don't  know for  sure.  The  first  was  to  add  to  the  credibility, ifthat's  the  right word,  of  this  revised proposal  on  Capitol  Hill  bycontinuing  to  assure certain members  of  Congress  that  we  would beinvolved  in  the  process.  Secondly,  they  felt  that  the  process  wouldbe  somewhat  less  formal  than would  have been  the  case  under  thelegislative  approach,  and therefore  they apparently wanted  to  signalin the  IMF's  press  release  that  we--we the  United States  and we  theFederal  Reserve  in particular--would be  involved  in  the  normalmonitoring,  if  I can put  it  that  way, and  that  the  IMF  would do  themanaging.made  for

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.us?Do we  know what  other  commitments they have

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I'm not  sure  what  level  of  commitment  this  is,but I am reasonably  confident  that  there  are  no big  surprises.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  You are  confident  there  are  not  a  lot  of  bigsurprises?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  One  of  the  reasons  why I held  forth quite asmuch as  I did yesterday was  to  try  to  convey  to  the Committee  in  fivecould without going  into  every eddy and  turn  that  this  matter hastaken over  the  last  four weeks.  I tried  to  outline  the  thrust of  thepolicy issues  and procedures as  I understood them.1/31-2/1/95-119-

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  There was  supposed to  be  a letter to  SenatorDole,  I believe  today,  outlining the conditions  that we  were going  toplace on Mexican economic policy.  Do you have  any idea  what  thoseconditions  are at  this  point?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The conditions  essentially are:  You will  have  atight  fiscal  policy;  you will have  a tight  monetary policy;  you willavoid exchange restrictions  and those  type  of  "thou shalt  not"restrictions.  There will be  nothing quantitative in  the  conditions,which is  one  of  the  frustrations, as  the Chairman  testified yesterday.There is  a desire  on  the part of  some  to  say,  for example,  that  theobjective  of  this  policy  is  to  drive  the peso exchange rate back  to3.5  per dollar.  There are  a number  of  members  of  Congress,  as  youprobably are  very much aware,  who say that  that  should be  the  soleobjective of  the policy.  First  of  all,  I don't  think  that  is  what  theUnited States  Treasury has in  mind.  Although some people  on  thisCommittee may think  that,  I do not  believe that  is  a majority viewmore  generally.  So,  the  lack of  quantitative parameters  in theserestrictions  is  one  of  the  reasons  why certain members  of  Congress areconcerned.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  With great  difficulty!

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Okay.  But,  believe  me,  in  the minds  of  themembers  of  Congress we are  locked in;  we  are  the ones  who  are  touphold this  agreement  even though we  have not  agreed to  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  I would argue  that  we  are  locked  in  anyhow.Even  if  we  are not  formally  locked in,  we would be  in  effect because,for a variety of  reasons we  have been very much involved--especiallyover  the  last  couple  of years  and certainly in  recent months--in  theparticulars of  monetary policy and the  financial  market  operations  ofthe  Bank of  Mexico.  It  is  not  just  the  Federal  Reserve Board  and theFederal  Reserve  Bank of New York;  it  is  also  the Federal  Reserve  Bankof Dallas,  for  example, which has  developed very detailed policyanalyses  and pronouncements relating  to  policy.  We  are  involved andwe  cannot  say  that  this  is  "they" and this  is  "we."  And we  do have  anagenda.  Bill  McDonough will  tell  you  that  one  of  the  agenda  items--ifI may put  it  that way,  Bill--is  to  get  the Mexican authorities  torelax their restrictions  on  the  functioning of  financial  markets  sothey will  have  a functioning foreign exchange market.  A particularelement  of  that,  I think partly at  Bill  McDonough's  insistence, waswritten  into  the  letter of  intent,  which specifies  that  they wouldrelax  those  restrictions.  That  is  something we have  an  interest  inbecause  it  is  the judgment  of  the  experts  that,  until  they have morenormal  features  in  their  foreign exchange market  and as  long as  theydo  not have  an  absolutely pegged exchange rate,  they will  have  sizablegyrations  in  their  exchange rate.  Such gyrations  are not  good  forthem and not  good for us.  If  the  rate  moves  5 percent  a day,  there  is1/31-2/1/95-120-just  no way for anybody  to  hedge or  cover themselves.  That  is  oneexample.  We  are  already involved  in  that.  We  are trying  to  helpthem,  through what might be called  technical  assistance, execute  afloating  exchange  rate policy.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  There  is  a difference between technicalassistance and  the word  "monitor."

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Right.  I can only tell  you what  I know.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  As a  short  follow-up question:  Does  thisletter  to  Senator Dole or  to  whomever  say anything about tightening?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I have not  seen  the  letter.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Do we  think it  says  anything about  the value  ofthe peso or  the Mexican  current  account?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  With regard to  the peso,  I  think at  most  it  saysthat  one  of  the  objectives of  the program would be  some strengtheningof  the  peso.  That  was  the  language  that  was  in  the  legislation  thatwas  set  aside yesterday.  It  would not have  tied  them  down to  3.5  or4.5  or  5.0  to  the dollar.  But  I have  to  say that  I have not  seen  theletter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Ted, it  may be  because  it  was  the  end of  the  daywhen you explained them, but  I am  still  trying  to  understand  theproposed series  of  transactions  and the  counterparties  to  thetransactions.  At  the present  time  we have  a $4-1/2  billion  swap  linedirectly with Mexico?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  With the  Bank of Mexico, right.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  And we  are being  asked to  increase  that  directparticipation to  $6 billion--that  is  what  it  says  here.  Thosetransactions  will all  be  directly with  the  Bank of  Mexico.  Are  theyincluded  in  the  guarantee  or  the assurance  of repayment  from  theTreasury?  It  is  not  actually from  the Treasury but  from  the  ESF?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes,  from the  ESF.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Okay.  Is  the  ESF  backed by  the  full  faith  andcredit  of  the U.S.  government?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I can't  give you  a legal  opinion.  The  ESF is  anentity of  the United States  government.  If  it made  a commitment to usthat  in some  sense  it  could not  cover out  of  its  own  funds,  I do  notknow whether  it  would have  an  automatic  draw on other United Statesgovernment  funds.  What  I can tell  you  is  the  following, and  this  maybe helpful:  The ESF will have  $20  billion in  the  sense  that  it  isexpected we will  give  it  to  them when or  if  we do  the warehousing.  Sothat  $20  billion program includes  $6 billion  covering our  swaps  and$14  billion of  their other  funds.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  You are  jumping  ahead of  me now.  I am justtrying  to  understand the  series  of  transactions  here  and who  is  behind1/31-2/1/95-121-what.  One  statement that  was made yesterday was  that  if  the ESF  didnot have  the  cash or  other  exchange  facilities  to  take  us  out  of  thesearrangements,  they might  give us  a note.  Would a note  of  the  ESF be  alegal  investment  for  the  Federal  Reserve?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I don't  think that  is  what  is  contemplated.

[SECTION]

MR.  LAWARE.  I'm  sure  it  is  not  contemplated;  nobodycontemplates  going broke,  either.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  But  I don't  think  that's  a realistic possibilitybecause  the Treasury knows  that it  has  to  have  $6 billion  set aside  totake us  out  12  months  later.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I am  stress  testing  the  system, a good riskmanagement  technique!  [Laughter]  The  second part  of this  transactionis  a warehousing arrangement that  I think was  characterized  lastevening  as  technically a swap.  We would  take marks  and yen out  of  theESF in  return  for dollars.  The ESF would then use  the dollars  toprovide  liquidity to  the Mexicans.  Is  that  correct?  Does  thisreassurance of  payment  include  taking us  out  of  whatever warehousingwe  do for  the  ESF?  And what  is  the  time  limit  on  that?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  a swap with a fixed forward  rateso  that  there  is  no market  risk.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I understand that,  but what  I am trying to  askis  whether this  same  take-out applies  to  the warehousing  arrangementas  it  does  to  our swaps  with Mexico?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Warehousing  is  a mechanism  that  removes  theforeign exchange  from  the  ESF's balance  sheet.  As  the  ESF needs  theforeign  exchange or as  they acquire  dollars  or  otherwise have dollars,they would unwind the warehousing in  the  same manner they unwound the$9 billion of  foreign exchange  that  they warehoused with us  in  thelate  '80s and early  '90s.

[SECTION]

MR.  LAWARE.  Then,  if  the  length of  this  agreement  could goout  10  years,  does  that mean  that  this  warehousing  arrangement couldgo  10  years?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  In  principle, yes.

MR.  LAWARE.  Thank you.

MR. TRUMAN.  An operation  the  ESF may engage  in would be  onethat  the proposed legislation had contemplated authorizing.  The  ESFsecurities backed  by the  U.S.  government  in  the  international  capital1/31-2/1/95-122-

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Would that  be  constrained by  the  total  of  $20

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  So  the  ESF could  only advance  or  guarantee  thatbillion?amount?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Or  $14  billion as  I said  in my answer  toGovernor LaWare.  The  $20  billion  includes  $6 billion  to  take  us  out;$14  billion  is  for  them  to do  these  other things.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  A  follow-up  to that:  Is  it  anticipated that  wewould not have  to  advance  the full  amount--our  $6 billion or  the  totalof  $20  billion--but that  that  amount  is  the maximum we would makeavailable?  In  other words,  are we  announcing this  amount  so  that  thethat will  keep us  from having  to  go  in with  the maximum of  $20billion?  Or  is  it  assumed  that we  are going  in  for  the  full  $20billion?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Certainly, it  is  not assumed  that we will  go  infor  the whole  $20  billion.  My personal  judgment  is  that one  alsoshould not  assume that  we would stop  substantially shy of  that.  Iwould be misleading the  Committee,  at  least  in  terms  of  my own thoughtprocesses,  if  I  left  the  impression  that  the  amount would be  only acouple more billion dollars  beyond where we  and the Treasury  aretoday,  collectively.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  A  couple  of  questions, Ted.  On  the  first pageon  the  swap arrangement,  item number 5 says  the Treasury would provideassurance of  repayment.  That really should  read  the ESF  if  Iunderstood you  correctly?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  Treasury  is  the  ultimate--

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  From a credit point of  view  it  is  not.  But youmean the  ESF?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes,  but I think  in fact  what the  Committeewants--this has not been written because  I didn't  want  to  put  it  inwriting until  after we had heard  the Committee's  discussion--is acommitment  from the  Secretary of  the Treasury  to  do whatever  isnecessary  in order  to  repay the  Federal  Reserve.  I don't want  to  tryto prejudge  or anticipate  the  way  in  which that  could be done.  TheESF  can get  funds  elsewhere.  For example,  one way the  Treasury paidus  off  in  the  1960s--took us out  of  exactly  this  type  of  arrangement--was  that  the  general  fund of  the Treasury drew deutschemarks  on  theInternational Monetary Fund.  It  then advanced those  deutschemarks  tothe  ESF which  the ESF used in turn  to  pay us  off.  So,  I do  not wantto preclude the possibility that  the  Secretary of  the  Treasury inexercising his  responsibilities would include  other ways  of paying  usthan  just  out  of  the  $20  billion.  This  is  notwithstanding my answerto  Governor LaWare's  question  that  their current  thinking  is  thattheir  budget  of  $20  billion  includes  $6 billion that  is  needed to  takeus  out.1/31-2/1/95-123-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Who's  the  chief  executive  officer,  ifthere  is  one,  of  the  ESF?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  Secretary of  the  Treasury--well,  really thePresident  of  the United States.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  President  of  the  United States  isthe  Chief  Executive.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  My reading  of  the  statute  is  that  the  funds  ofthe  ESF are  to  be  used by  the  Secretary of  the Treasury with  theapproval  of  the  President.  The  ESF  is  under  the exclusive  control  ofthe  Secretary of  the Treasury.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  relevant  to  your question as  towhere  the  legal  authorities lie.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I endorse what  you are  saying.  We should  get asmuch as  we  can  in  terms  of  assuring  our sources  of  repayment.  I wouldthink in  a narrow legal  sense  the  credit we  are  looking  at probably isthe  ESF  and not  the Treasury.  Otherwise, we  get  into  questions,  if  itis  a guaranteed  obligation, about  our  extending credit  to  theTreasury.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I agree,  but  either way, whether narrowly  orbroadly construed, the  commitment would come  from the  Secretary of  theTreasury because he has  the authority,  subject  to  the  approval  of  thePresident, to  do  this.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  There  is  no mention  in here  of  the  oil paymentsthat you  described yesterday.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  My way  of  thinking about  this,  but  that  again  issomething one  could debate,  is  that  in some  sense  our backstop  is  theTreasury.  How they backstop themselves  is  their business.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  So,  if  this  oil payments  backup got  set  up,  thatis  not  really an  issue  for us?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Right.  The  Treasury has  said they will  ask  foroil  to back up  their  loans  to Mexico, which would include  theoperations  that  they may take  over  from us.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  But  under this  arrangement  that becomes  theirbusiness and not ours,  and  the  swap  is  in  effect an unsecured  swapwith a put  to  the Treasury or  a put  to  the ESF?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  You could do  it  either way, but  I think it  isprobably  cleaner  to  do  it  as  I explained.  If  they  take  over  ourobligation  to  the  Bank of Mexico,  the  funds  from  the  oil  facilitywould first  come  to  them.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  As  fiscal  agent  it  will  be  my problem  to dealwith  their oil  accounts  and all  that,  but  that  is  changing  ourparticipation entirely  to  that  of  just being  the  Treasury's agent.The New York Fed will  still  be  used, but  it  is  not  the  System'sexposure.1/31-2/1/95-124-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The oil  proceeds would flow  from  that  account.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Under  that  arrangement, what  is  locked up at  theNew York Fed now  in  effect gets  released?  So,  for us  that  is  not  anissue?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Let me  be  clear.  Nothing can be locked up  inthe New York Fed.  The only point  at which something  can be  taken fromthe New York Fed  is--.  Oh, do you mean  locked up  in  the  sense we werediscussing  last night?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  I think Tom meant  locked up  oil money.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Okay.  Let me  ask a couple  of  quick  questionsabout  the  warehousing.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  There are a couple  of  points  I did want  to  makegoing  through this.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Are we  still  on  the  first  item?  I'm sorry.  Iwas  out  of  the  room when you  started.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  He was  on background from  lastnight.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Yes,  on general  questions and now we are  goingto  go  to  the  specifics.  Mr. Chairman,  do you want me  to say  somethingabout the  specifics  for both or  for  each  separately?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Go  ahead on both.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I just want  to  amplify a few points  on  the  swaparrangement  first.  Basically,  the  first  point  on  the piece of  paper  Ihanded out  says  that we would have  essentially  two  swap  arrangements:One  would be  the  regular  $3 billion swap  arrangement;  the  other wouldbe  a  special  swap  arrangement.  The Bank of Mexico would be  able  todraw on those  arrangements  for  12  months  as  of yesterday.  Eachdrawing could be  outstanding  for  12  months.  The next point  says  thatthe  absolute outside  time  limit  for  final repayment  either  from  theMexicans or  the Treasury would be  January 31,  1997.  As  the  Bank ofMexico  did repay, however,  the  size  of  the  special  line would bereduced permanently.  If  after  rising above  $3 billion the  drawingsgot  down below  the  $3 billion mark,  they would go back  into  theregular  swap  line,  which would require a separate  decision to  beactivated.We talked about  the Treasury  take-out.  There  are a number ofways  in which that  could be done.  One  thing  I did not mention--it'ssomething we would have  to  work out--is  the  question of  how, goingforward, the drawings would be  shared between the  Federal  Reserve  andthe Treasury.  Currently, we  are operating under  the  December 30thframework where everything  is  done  50/50.  I would assume  that  goingforward  the  sharing would be approximately two  to  one.  Again,however,  I think one needs  to  be realistic.  If  the  ESF were  to  get1/31-2/1/95-125-involved,  for example,  in making a  $5 billion  loan guarantee, whichwould take  some  time  to  set up,  there might be  some  adjustments  as  wewent  along.  But  ultimately as  the  amount  got  toward the maximum  levelwe  would be moving to  that  two-to-one proportion.The  warehousing proposal  is probably somewhat  clearer.  Theproposal  is  to  raise  the  amount  from the  existing  $5 billion  to  $20billion.  This  is  clearly a rather  exceptional  operation, and  therationale  is  to  facilitate  this program.  The  third point  is  that  thisexcludes the warehousing  of  pesos.  That,  it  seems  to me,  is  requiredin  terms  of  the  overall  logic  of  this  arrangement.  I would argue  thatthat  is  a matter we probably  ought  to  keep  internal  rather than put  inthe minutes at  this  stage.  Finally, although I would  say that  thisarrangement should be  subject  to  annual  review,  I think  in answer  toGovernor LaWare's  question and  someone  else's  is  that  in principlesome  of  this  warehousing might  be  outstanding, in  the  limit,  for  10years.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  What  is  the  size  of  the  ESF?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  The usable  funds  in  the  ESF  today, counting  theforeign exchange as  usable,  amount to  roughly  $25  billion.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Can you  say how  it  is  broken  down?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  About  $5 billion is  invested in  Treasurysecurities  and  the  balance  is  roughly equally divided between marksand yen.  I think  they have  slightly more  yen  than marks.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Is  any  of  it  obligated in  any way beyond what  weare  talking about  with Mexico?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It  is  obligated only  in the  sense  that  they haveone  other swap  arrangement with  the Bundesbank.  So,  in some  sense  ifthey wanted  to  advance dollars  to  the  Bundesbank  they would use  someof  the dollars  for  that.  But nothing  is  obligated in  a currentcommitment.  One  of  the  Treasury's  concerns is  that  this  operationdoes  severely limit  what  the  ESF could do over a  fairly extendedperiod  of  time.  It  preserves  the ability of  the  ESF to  use  itsforeign  exchange holdings  for exchange  operations, but  that  isprobably about  all  it  does.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Ted,  I have  two questions.  One  hasa preamble.  Since we  are  an  independent  central  bank dealing with  theExecutive  Branch and because  we are  a bank,  the  analogy would be  thatwe are  a bank dealing with  an affiliated company--something that  wetake  very seriously as  regards  the way it  is  done  by the banks wesupervise.  Is  it  safe  to  assume  that  we will  have very, very cleardocumentation  of  both  the warehousing  facility and the  take-out  of  theswap  line?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Certainly.  We intend to  have  a  letter from  theSecretary of  the  Treasury to  the  Chairman of  the  Federal Reserve  onthat  matter.1/31-2/1/95-126-

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  The  second question:  If  a bank  saysto  a customer, we  are  making a line  of credit  available to  you but  assoon as  you  repay any of  it,  it  goes  away, that  discourages  thecustomer  from repaying until  the  last  minute.  So  I am not  sure  thatthat particular piece  described on  the  first page, paragraph  4, isreally  in our  interest,  and you might want  to  rethink  that.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  There are  two  sides  to  that.  Peter  and Idiscussed  it  this  morning.  I decided that between  the  two  choices  theCommittee would be  happier saying that  once  the  drawings got  repaidthe  total would get  subtracted  and a separate decision  would have  tobe made about  putting  the  funds  out  again.  If  I may piggyback a biton  the question Governor Lindsey asked  earlier and the  fact  that theseswap drawings  roll  over every three months,  if  one  found Mexico'sreserves growing  rapidly we would have  the  scope  to  encourage  them torepay.  We could not require  them to  repay but we could use moralsuasion in  the effort  to  secure  early repayment.  That might dealpartly with your problem.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  But  in  fact we have  always  structured eachrollover  as  subject  to mutual  consent.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We  are  committing ourselves  in  advance  toprovide  that  consent.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  But  to whom are we committing?  Are  wecommitting to  the Treasury or we  are  committing to  the Mexicans?  Ithink the whole  thing does  hang on  the  difference  there.  We  can agreewith  the Treasury and within the  Committee  as  to  what  the  rules  are,but vis-a-vis  our  relations with the Mexicans  and how we rewrite  theswap agreements,  etc.--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  rewrite probably would say the maturity isthree months with renewal--

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Three months and we have  to  agree to  renew.  So,that may be  the  discipline which squares  the circle.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  However,  I doubt  that we'd want to get  to  thesituation where we use  it.  What  we would end up doing  is  using moralsuasion at  the  end of  three months rather than whatever thealternative is--

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?). "Immoral"  suasion!

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  --actually calling  the  loan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  May I just  ask a question  on mechanics?  Theyhave  the right  to  draw for a period  of  up  to  12  months.  So  let's  saythey draw on January  30th of  1996;  that  drawing could be  outstandingthree months and  could be  rolled over  three  times.  Is  the  agreementwith  the Treasury that  no matter how new the drawing  is  we get  takenout  a year from now or  is  the  agreement with the  Treasury that we gettaken out  of  any drawing  that  is  12  months  or older?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  The  latter.1/31-2/1/95-127-

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Then  in  this  hypothetical  case we  would not  berepaid until  January 31,  1997?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  By  1997,  yes.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Two years  from now.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Okay.  Second question:  On the monitoringside,  going back  to March  of  last year--I  think  it  was March when wefirst  expanded the  swap line  under the NAFTA-related agreement--atthat  time Mexico had  something  like  $25  billion  in reserves  andeverybody was pretty  satisfied that  repayment was not  an  issue.  Fromkinds  of  things will  go  on,  going  forward, to  prevent  that  fromhappening  again?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That is  the  other  side  of  the monitoringquestion.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.1/31-2/1/95-128-

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Would we have a firmer handle on  this than  theTreasury or the  IMF?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We would have a responsibility, and the  Treasurycertainly feels  it  has  a responsibility, because  the Treasury willhave  a lot  vested  in the  success  of  this.  That  is  what  I meant when Isaid  in answer  to  Governor Lindsey's question that  I think we have nochoice but  to be  involved  in  the monitoring--whether  our role  is  putup  in neon  lights  by the  International Monetary Fund or not.  If  I maymake a personal statement  on this  matter, having lived through  thedevaluations  of  1976  and 1982  and now this one,  I have a personalstake  in  insuring  that this  does not  happen this  way again.  That  isall  I can  say as  far  as  I am concerned;  that  is  a personal  remarkrather than an  institutional  remark.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  And one  final  question on  the  $40  billion  inguarantees:  I think  I understood how those  would be used--essentiallyto  lower the  interest  rate on  new tesobono  securities by replacing  theMexican guarantee with  that of  the U.S.  government.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  It would not have  been  linked.  Basically whatwould have happened under  the previous arrangement  is  that  the  Bank ofMexico would have  gone  out with the  U.S. government  guarantee andraised,  for example,  $5 billion in the  international capital markets.They would have  used those  funds  to  meet  the pressure on  the  exchangerate  that would be  associated with the  holders  of  tesobonos, which  arepaid off  in pesos,  not wanting to  roll  them over but  rather wanting  totake the pesos  and buy dollars.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.  Are  these drawings  basically going tobe used in  the  same way except that  the  international capital  marketsdo not  get  involved?  They just use  the  cash?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  As  long as  they do not  use  the guarantee withit.  What would be necessary  for  the  Treasury, and  I would assume we'dbe  somewhat  involved in an  advisory role,  would be  to  require  theMexicans,  as  under  the  contemplated legislation, to  come up with afinancial plan.  That  financial plan presumably would say:  These  arethe  sources of  funds  we are  going  to  have  over  the  coming short periodof  time;  for  some  longer period of  time,  this  is  going to  be  ourstrategy, which includes  what  we  do with monetary policy.  I don'tknow what  Peter  thinks, but  I personally thought  it  was a mistakeyesterday  for  them essentially to  cancel  the  tesobono auction because1/31-2/1/95-129-the rates  were  so  high  and they had  just been bailed out  by PresidentClinton.  I may be  wrong  about  that.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I can  add something  that  at  least  supports  whatTed is  saying, and  I am being quite  candid about  some  of  the problemsthat  Mexico has  going forward, which you are  both talking  about.Mexico  has  an  independent  central bank.  But,  going back  to  the  issueTed  raised about  Bill's views  and mine  on  the need  to  get  theirsignaling mechanism  is  through  the control  of  the auction process  bythe Treasury,  and that  is  the bigger problem.  In  the  long run,  theBank of  Mexico  is  controlling  the monetary base.  In  any one week  itis  the  Hacienda that  is  controlling  the  signaling process.  And thatwas what happened  in November;  that  is what  happened yesterday;  andthat  is  a real  problem going  forward.  That is  partly why  I feel  sostrongly that  if  they are going  the route  of  the  float,  then  they haveto  take  steps  to  liquify  and get better  intermediation in  theirsecondary market.  It  is  one  of  the  reasons.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  You mentioned the  financial plan.  I think youtied it  into  the legislation.  Is  that  going to  be  tied into  thisagreement,  too?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes.  The Treasury will  insist  that  in  order  toimplement  this  program, an  agreement  or  a series  of  agreements willhave  to be worked out with  the Mexicans  about  what  they are  going todo.  And I am using the  term  "financial  plan"  to  refer to  that.  TheTtreasury needs  to  think  about  these  things  before  it  dribbles  $14billion out  the door.1/31-2/1/95-130-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can I ask  for  a short  recess?  I have  toconsult with our  utility hitter.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  On  another  aspect  of  this  problem!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This will  take  just  a couple  of minutes.[Meeting  recessed]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mr.  Truman.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  My expectation  is  that we will  get  a commitmentfrom the  Secretary of  the Treasury  to  do what  is  required  to  take  thisloan off  our books after  12  months.  Exactly how we  are going tospecify  that,  I do  not know.  It  is  my personal view that  having a  52-these  types of matters  is  not  in our  interest.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  I'm not  sure how many pages are  appropriate.Tom Melzer used  the  term  "put,"  but  is  the Treasury committing  to  alegal  obligation  to  take  us  out  of  this?  You used the word  "take-out"and I know what  a  take-out  is.  Is  this  a take-out  or is  it  not atake-out?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  it  is  a  take-out.  The  issue  ofprecisely how  it  will  be  constructed is  something which our  GeneralCounsel  and  their General  Counsel  will  work on.  The  principle of  theagreement  is  that  it  is  a take-out.  Basically, the  agreement  is  thatthe  Federal  Reserve  has  zero  credit risk and  zero market  risk;  that  isthe  principle.  How  that  is  formulated and what  documents  areexchanged  to  implement  that  is  up  to  the  lawyers,  but it  won't besmoke and mirrors.  I have no  idea what  they are  going to  do,  and  Isuspect  that  they may in  fact  run  into  the  same questions  that havebeen raised with Ted about  the  ESF's  legal  authority  for  this,  or whoowns  that,  or what happens here.  As Tom Melzer  says,  we can't make  adirect  loan  to  the  Treasury;  it  is  illegal.  All  of  that will,  Iassume,  be  resolved.  What  I will  say to  you  is  that  the  nature of  thehandshake,  if  I can put  it  that  way, is  that we  have  zero  credit  riskand  zero market  risk.  It  is  a take-out;  that  is  unambiguous.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  I would  like  to  make  one  other point  on  this.President Melzer asked a question  earlier about  the oil mechanism.Even  I, with  a reputation  for  exuberance, if  that's  the right  word,would not go  so  far  as  to  give  up  the  current arrangement  that  liesbehind our  $4-1/2  billion  swap  line before being  satisfied  that  wehave  appropriate arrangements  in place  to  convert  all  this  into  someother form.  Even  I would not  be  so  imprudent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Ted, I would like  to  ask you  to  sort  of  stepback  from this  for a  second.  We have  talked  a  lot about  the details,and the  Chairman has  just  said  that  the  principle  involved  is  for  theFederal  Reserve  to  have  zero  credit  risk and  zero market  risk.  Whatare  the  risks  to  the Federal  Reserve here?  What  kind of  scenariocould you envision  that  could cause  significant problems  for us?1/31-2/1/95-131-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  My answer to  that  question would be  that  theproblems we  are  likely to  have  with this  are  least  likely to  befinancial.  It  seems  to  me  that  there  are essentially two  risks.  Onelies with what might  go  on  in Mexico  if  the  overall program does notwork.  If  the Mexican situation  spirals  out  of  control  and we  areinvolved--we  already  are  involved with  the existing  swap  line but  ourinvolvement could  increase--we  would get  caught up  in  that  situationeconomically.  It  seems  to  me that  the  other principal  risk, which mayor  may not be  related,  is  that  this  set  of  arrangements  could comeunder intense political  scrutiny in  this  country regardless  of whatgoes  on in  Mexico.  And I can well  imagine  that  that  kind  of  scrutinyis  something that many people  within  the  Federal  Reserve would preferto  do without.  I can say from my own experience  that  there are  anumber of  people  on Capitol  Hill  who  are  involved  in  oversight  onthese  arrangements  and are  reassured by  the  fact  that  we are  involvedin  the process.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Ted,  can I go a  little  further thanthat?  The response  to  your question might be  that,  as  best  we  canjudge,  the  risks  from  this new  agreement  to  the Federal  Reserve  from afinancial  point  of  view are reduced  because  of  the  take-out  issue.The  real  risks  relate  to  the  issue  that  Larry Lindsey  is  raising  andimplicitly what  Ted  is  raising.  The problem is  the  fact  that we  havemanaged to build up  a high degree  of  credibility.  The  difficulty isthat  the  Federal  Reserve has  now become  the honest broker.  I havejust been  invited  to  speak,  for  example, before  the  Democratic SenateCaucus,  not  on Mexico  but more  or  less  on  the world  at  large.  TheFederal  Reserve  is  presumed to  be  an honest  nonpartisan broker, whichtherefore means  that  suddenly everyone wants  to  drag us  into  themiddle  of  big problems.  This  is  not  the  last  time  this  is  going  tohappen.  We  could very easily  eliminate  that  by following  a misguidedmonetary policy and making us  all  very controversial!  But,  as  crucialplayers  in  the  American government,  I frankly  don't  know how to  getaround accepting  this  responsibility when we are  being asked by  theCongress and  the Administration to  somehow oversee  this operation,which  is  a very fuzzy deal.  I was  out  of  the  room when Larry wasasking his  questions, but  I could figure out  exactly where  he wasgoing.  When he  finished,  I probably could have continued askingsimilar  types  of  questions.  This  is  where  we have  a problem.  We  donot  have a choice,  as  I see  it,  of  saying we are  not going to  beinvolved  in  this,  but we  do have  a choice  in  terms  of  figuring out  howwe  are  going  to get  involved.  At  the moment,  I have  not  beenapproached officially on  any of  this.  The only  call  I have receivedwas  from Mr. Camdessus  this  morning.  I could not  return his  callyesterday.  He wanted  to  ask me  whether his  remark  in  his  releasepublished yesterday was acceptable  to  us.  I assumed  that  it  had beencleared.  I thought  it  had been  cleared by you,  Bill,  because  he  saidhe  did speak  to  you.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  That  was earlier;  yesterday hespoke with Ted.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So  I heard what  was  involved, but  I wasasked only after the  fact--as  if  it  could be pulled back  after apublic  release.  That  is  the  sole  official  request  that  I have gottenfrom anybody.  I have  heard a lot  of  rumors  about  all  of  this.  Tedtells  me about  the  different  initiatives  that  are  going on  and whatpieces  of  paper are  being circulated.  But  nobody has  approached us1/31-2/1/95-132-and  asked us  to  get  involved  in this.  It  is  a very vague  thing;  it  islike  asking me to  umpire  the new game  of  zipswitch,  and I would say,what?  [Laughter]  I don't  know what  the  rules  are.  I don't  know whothe  players are.  I don't know what  is  going on, but  am  I to  be  theumpire?  And they say,  sure,  why not?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Even  though you have  not been asked, it  hasbeen  reported that you have  agreed!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Agreed to  what?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  To umpire  zipswitch.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Terrific!  In answer  to  your question,Ted  is  exactly right.  The risk  is  not  a financial  risk that we havehere, but  we do have a risk.  The risk is  essentially political--notin  the sense  that  we are  subjected  to political  pressures.  It  is  inthe  fact  that  people are  trying  to  get us  to  do  things  that  I suspectcannot possibly be  done  effectively, efficiently, or  otherwise.  Thatis  a problem  that  we are  going to  have  to  confront.  I am not  sureexactly how we  are going to  come out  of  this,  or how we  will  handleit.  But  there  is  where  I think our  problem is.  Anyone who  has  somegreat  ideas  is  welcome  to  throw them  in,  especially if  he  or  she  canexplain  to me what the  game  of  zipswitch  is  all  about!

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  If  I could just  follow up  on  this  for a  second.I do not know the  game  of  zipswitch.  I think there  clearly is  a verysignificant  risk.  The other  risk  that  Ted mentioned first  is  that  theoverall  program  in Mexico  will  not work.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  it  does  not work, that  is  a majoreconomic problem.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Of  course.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But  it  does  not create more  credit  riskfor us.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  No, but  it  has  the potential  for  drawing us  infurther down  the  road.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  could  conceivably.  That would berelated to  how we position ourselves  with respect  to  this  monitoringissue.  The  crucial  thing that  we  have  to  do,  no matter how we  getinvolved in  this,  is  to  review Mexico's  forthcoming plan.  We werefully  aware when  this began  that  we were dealing with a  seriousproblem.  We  knew that  if  we did not  get  involved,  there were going  tobe  some very serious  negative responses  and  I am  not sure  how thiswhole  thing would ultimately have  come  out.  But we  also knew thatthere  is  a slippery  slope  here.  The  question is,  did we realisticallyhave  the option  of  saying,  "this  is  a  slippery-slope  issue  and wewould prefer  not  to  be  involved."  The answer  is  that  it  would havebeen 'irresponsible for us  not to  get  involved.  The  reason I went upto  the Hill  at  one point  to  speak on this  issue  to  two-thirds  of  theSenate and about  one-third of  the House,  all  in one  room,  is  that  if  Idid not  do  it,  it  would not get  done.  That's because  no  one  there hadany knowledge  of  this  except people  in Treasury who  are  not--1/31-2/1/95-133-

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Have no  standing  or are  from a differentpolitical party.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  is  not  a question of  their  standingor  even being in  a different political party;As  a consequenceof  that,  what happened was  that  the Congressional  leadership  and theSecretary of  the Treasury told me  I had  to  go up  to  the Hill  and talkabout this.  Was  I going to  say that  I had to remain  Simon-pure andnot be  involved with this?  That  would have been utterly irresponsiblebecause  in  a certain  respect  we are  the  only institution in  town  thatcan credibly be  involved in  this  sort  of  thing.  We  were not  certainwhere  it  was all  heading, but we knew that  once we took  the firststep,  there would be  a lot  of  other  steps  down  the  road.  How we  couldorchestrate that was not  terribly clear, as  indeed it  is  not  clearnow.  I think we  are  going to  have  some very  tricky moments  beforethis  gets  resolved.  If  the Mexicans work this  out,  if  the crisis  getsresolved  and everything simmers  down, all  these  conversations  aremoot.  The  issue  will  just  go  away, the  loans  will  be paid off,  thefunding  facilities  will be  shut  down, and we will  go back to  squareone.But  there  is  a good probability that  this  financingassistance will  not work, which means  that  at  some  point  it  will  becut  off.  I think  the  probability  that Mexico  will  go  througheveryone's money and  then default  is  zero.  It  is  not  going to happenthat  way.  The  really tricky problems are  going  to  be how to work ourway out  of  this  if  the  program clearly  is  not working.  We can'tdiscuss  that because,  if  we  did,  then we  can be  sure  that  the programwould not  work and we  would have very serious  problems.  So,  we  haveall  of  these  issues  which are  quite risky  for  this  central  bank.Because  of  the  take-out,  the  aspect  I am  least  concerned about  is  thefinancial  risk.  We  are okay there.  That was  not  the case  earlierwhen, as  you  all  know, I was very much concerned about  the  amount ofcollateral  that was available  from Mexican  oil proceeds  or--I  amsorry, Ted, about  the  choice of  words--the  "assured means  ofrepayment"  that we  had.  After  a certain point,  I think  the oilguarantee is  not a credible,  or an  assured, means  of payment.  But  nowthat  issue  is  moot because we  have  a Treasury  take-out.  What we  nowface  is  a very different  set  of  problems  that  are going  to  be  fairlydifficult  to  deal  with.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I think  you havedescribed the  situation very accurately.  The credit  risk  to  theFederal  Reserve,  as  I view it,  has been removed.  Certainly, Virgiland our  other  legal  colleagues  can  draft  the  documentation  to  be  surethat  it  is  removed  and stays  removed.  I believe very  firmly that youhad  no  choice but  to  get  involved.  Since  you got  involved,  theFederal  Reserve got  involved, appropriately  in my view, even  though  itis  uncomfortable  for you and all  the  rest  of us.  Essentially, we  arein a situation where  our  involvement  has  to be maintained  and where  wehave  to  do the  best we can to  ensure  that  the  terms  for  ourinvolvement are  done  in  the best possible way.  This means  some  verytough conditionality, but as  for  the  two  items  for which  we needapproval,  I think we may have  reached the point  where a motion wouldbe appropriate for both of  them.1/31-2/1/95-134-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Before  we get  there,  I think Tom Melzerstill has  a  few questions.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Let  me  just  ask a couple  of quick  questions  onthe  financial  side  because  I think  it  could be helpful  as  you work outthese arrangements  to  be  sure  we all  understand.  As  I understand it,of  the  $20  billion in  the warehouse  facility,  the most  that  would beadvanced to  the Mexicans would be  $14  billion.  Then $6 billion--

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That  is  one  way of  thinking about  it.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  And $6 billion would be retained in  the  ESF.When it  is  time  to  take  our swap  out,  we  in effect warehouse  thatremaining  $6 billion and pay ourselves  off.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That would be  one  scenario.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  It  seems  to me  that  we  have  to  have  somerequirement that  the ESF retains  good  collateral of  $6 billion so  thattransaction can  get  effected and we can get  taken  out.  I am sure youwill  take  care  of  that.  I don't  know whether it  makes any  sense  toestablish any expectations.  I know we have  annual reviews  by  thisCommittee of  the warehousing  facility.  Does  it  do  any good  toestablish any expectations  up front  that we would not  expect  thiswarehousing  to  be  outstanding longer  than  10  years,  for  example?  Andwhat  sort  of  expectations  should we  set with respect  to  thepossibility of  doing additional warehousing  operations,  say, unrelatedto  Mexico?  I think you said  it before, but  from my point of view thispretty much exhausts  whatever  flexibility the  ESF has,  or perhapswhatever we  perceive we might warehouse  for  them.  Never  say never,but the  expectation ought  to  be  that  there  is  not  another  $20  billionbehind this  one if  they want  to  intervene in  exchange markets.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That  is  one  of  the  reasons  why we are bringingit  up.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can  I just  say something quickly?  Ifthey want  to  do  that,  they have  to  get  authorization  for newappropriated funds  from  the Congress.  That  has  nothing to  do with us.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I was  talking about  expectations with respect toour willingness  to warehouse  anything beyond  this  $20  billion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mean  in  the  future?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I see what  you  are  saying;  the  ESF will haveused up  its  assets.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes,  there would be  nothing  left.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  following up on yesterday's  discussion,  Iwant  to  add  two separate  thoughts.  One,  as  far  as warehousing pesos,we have  said no.  I think that  is  important  to  the consistency of  thisoperation.  As  a technical matter,  the  ESF will  still have  somelimited capacity to  acquire  foreign  exchange, more yen or DM,  in  theconceivably  they might do  that  at  some point.  They might  say we  havebought  another  $5 billion worth of  yen and want  to  warehouse  those1/31-2/1/95-135-with  the  Federal  Reserve,  too.  Whether  the ESF  can  do  that  wouldrequire  a separate decision by the  Federal  Open Market  Committee.  Oneof  the reasons  that  I,  at  least,  would favor putting  in place  the bignumber, which  is  matched with other  big numbers  in  terms  of  theprogram itself and with their  existing holdings  of  foreign  exchange,is  that  it  would make what  we are  doing much clearer.  The  slipperyslope  of  doing  things  a billion here  and a billion  there  is  to  someextent avoided.On  the question of  review, I would think it  depends  on  theappetite  of  the Committee.  Peter will  be  regularly reviewing  foreignexchange market  developments  with the Committee,  and Mexico  for betteror  for worse  is  inevitably going to  be part  of  that  for  some  monthsand perhaps a  couple of years.  So,  I think there will  be  a lot  ofopportunity  for  the Committee  to  exercise  its  oversight  of  this.  Tothe  extent  that  disbursements  mount up quickly, there will  be  a chancein March  to  find out what  has  been going on.  The  staff will  make aneffort--as we  have  tried  to  do  in  the past  though maybe not  alwayssuccessfully--to  keep the  Committee  as  informed as  we  can  aboutongoing  events  and to  minimize  the number of  surprises.  Thereprobably won't be  any surprises because  we have  a perfect crystalball!

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  One last  question  and then  I have  just  a coupleof  comments  that  I would like  to  make.  This has  to  with the  excesscollateral  in  terms  of  backing U.S.  currency.  I recall  that  when wewarehoused a  lot  of  foreign  currencies  for  the ESF before, we  got  intoa problem with  fairly narrow excess  collateral.  If  we do  this  $20billion, we  will  then  in  effect  substitute these  foreign currencyholdings  for domestic  securities.  And when we have  to  sell  domesticsecurities, we will have  less  of what  is  viewed as  acceptablecollateral  to  back the  currency.  If  we  exceed those  limits,  we  haveto  announce  to  Congress  that we are  backing our  Federal  reserve noteswith other types  of  assets.  What  is  the  likelihood  of having to  makethat  sort  of  announcement?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I do not  know what  the  current  situation is.  Myguess  is--and  it  is  a wild guess--that if  the warehousing  got  up  to$20  billion, we  could be  in  that  situation.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I don't  think we have an  obligation to  announceto  Congress.  We have  an  obligation in  the  sense  that Governor Parteeonce  said to  Congress  that  we would use our  foreign  exchange holdingslast  to  collateralize  our Federal  Reserve notes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If  we  get  to  that  point, we  can  alwaysdo  an off-market  swap with  the  Japanese  or  the Germans.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I am  just  trying  to  understand all  theimplications  of  this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There  are  balance  sheets  implications.The last  time  it  happened was  five years  ago,  as  I recall.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Yes,  it  was  a seasonal  thing, but  there was atime  of the  year when we got  very close  to  exhausting our  regular  notecollateral--I  think when we had  $9 billion of  warehousing  on ourbalance  sheet.1/31-2/1/95-136-

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  What  we  do not know is  whether  the  scale ofthings has  increased enough  since  then  combined with the  fact  thatreserve requirements  have  come  down  so  that we would have  the  room.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Brian Madigan  said he  thought  the projection offree  collateral was  $8 to  $10  billion over  some  indefinite period.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  In  terms  of  my own feelings  about  this,  Alan,while  I respect  your point  of  view on  this,  I really have not  heardanyone make a case  that  what we  are  facing here  is  some  sort  offinancial  crisis  in the  United States  that  has  systemic  implications.I think what  we  are  really  talking about--when  I say we,  I am sayingthat broadly--is providing  long-term financing toanother  country that  has  mismanaged its  financial  affairs.  Ifthe  Treasury wants  to  do  that,  that  is  their prerogative.  But  it  isnot  appropriate for a  central bank to  participate  directly orindirectly in  such arrangements,  and I  think we  are setting  a very badprecedent.  Now, I know that  technically  the way this  appears  on  thesurface  is  that  the Treasury is  doing  it  and we  are facilitating it.But  I think the  perception is  going  to be  that we  are very much a  fullpartner  in  this.The  other thing  that  concerns me  is  the  use of warehousingarrangements.  As  we  all  know, we  have been  criticized in  the pastwhen warehousing  arrangements  were used  to  facilitate  "normal"transactions whose purpose was  to  stabilize  dollar  exchange  markets.What we are  talking  about  here  is  a totally different  type  offacilitation, much larger-sized.  This  gets back to  the  second riskthat  came  out  in response  to  Michael Moskow's  question.  I suspectthat may  subject us  to  even more  criticism  inasmuch  as Congress  andthe American people  apparently  strongly  oppose extending  credit  toMexico.  In effect,  one  could argue that  we would be participating inan  effort to  subvert  that  will  of  the public,  if  you  will.  I do  notwant  to  be too dramatic  in  stating  that.  This  could cause  a re-evaluation of  the  institutional structure  of  the  Fed  in a veryfundamental  and broad way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I seriously  doubt  that,  Tom.  I amreally  sensitive  to  the  political  system  in this  society.  The dangerspolitically at  this  stage  and  for  the  foreseeable future  are not  tothe  Federal  Reserve but  to  the  Treasury.  The Treasury,  for politicalreasons,  is  caught up  in  a lot  of  different  things.  Republicans up  onthe Hill  look at  the  Federal  Reserve as  the  good guy.  I think  thisissue of  a majority on  the Hill  looking  at  us  in  another way  ismissing the  problem, which  is  exactly the  opposite  of what you  aresaying.  They  look on us  as  the good guy and  they are willing  to besupportive of  the  President and  the Administration only if  we areinvolved.  That  is where  our problem lies.  It  is  like  the  800 poundgorilla  who  loves you  and grabs  you.  Thanks  a  lot!  [Laughter]  Iseriously doubt  that  the problem you  are  discussing  is where  ourvulnerability  lies.  I see  that  Larry Lindsey  is  shaking his head as  Iam talking.  I must  say that  I disagree with both of  you.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I am not surprised  to  hear you  say  that  becauseobviously you would not have  gotten  involved  if--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would not have gotten  involved,exactly.1/31-2/1/95-137-

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I understand that  and I think people candisagree  on these  issues.  I just  felt  it was  important  to  say  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I was  just  trying  to  say that,  if  I canpossibly talk you out  of  this  concern, it  is  one  that  I think franklyis  really de  minimis.  If  you want  something to  worry about, I havelots  of  things  that  I would like you  to  worry about.  This  is  not  oneof  them.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I think my questions have  beenanswered.  I have a general understanding of what  is proposed here.There are  two aspects  to  this:  One  is  to  contain the  immediate  crisisand the  other  is  to  assure that  it does  not recur  in two years  orwhenever.  I am very unclear  on  the process  to  assure  that  it  does notrecur, as  you  said that  you are.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You bet!

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  In another  sense,  I think it  is  unprecedentedfor  us  to  come into  this  process with so  much uncertainty.  I willdefer  to your  judgment.  This  is  important and must go  forward.  But  Ihave a lot  of  sympathy for what  Tom is  saying.  I am uneasy about  it.If  it weren't  for the magnitude  of  this  crisis and your  involvement,  Iwould have  grave  reservations about doing  this.  I defer  to  yourjudgment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I am going to  be  the  last  to  deny thatthere  are problems here.  Let me  say this,  however.  Those whobelieved that  the Mexican situation was  containable, short  ofsomething of  this nature,  did not  have  their  fingers  on  the  structureof  things  as  they were  falling apart.  One  can argue  quite  crediblythat  the  fault  is  theirs.  The problem is,  to use another analogy,that  they are  the house next  door.  If  somebody  there  smokes,  thehouse catches  on  fire,  and cinders  going in our direction threaten  toburn  our house down,  can we  say we  are not  going to  help  them put  outthe  fire?  The  answer  is  that we have no  other choice.  This  crisis  isnot of  our making.  I am  fully convinced that  if we  had  tried to  staycompletely out  of  this  and said  that we would not get  involved in anyway,  this  situation  could not have been staunched;  I am not sure  thatit has  been.  From the point  of  view of  the  country as  a whole,  itwould have been  irresponsible on our part  not  to be  involved.  Whenyour neighbor  is  lying  in the  street, screaming, you can just walkover him and keep walking and not get  involved,  I grant  you that.  Ido not  think we  have  that choice.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I would like  to  endorse  almost everything  theChairman said and then  ask two  questions, one of  which I think youcan't answer.  And when you  say you can't  answer  it,  I am going tohave a very specific  request, because I do agree with the  Chairman.First  of  all,  I do not have any problem with what  is  on  these twopieces  of paper.  I don't think we  should have any problem for many ofthe  reasons  that were  just  stated.  There is  a third piece of paperthat  is  not here  that  says  the  Federal Reserve will  monitor....and nowfill  in  the  rest  of  the  sentence.  You can't  answer right  now what  isin  that part  of  the  sentence.  My request  is  to  get  an  answer  to  thatas  soon as  it  is humanly possible.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  are going  to do  that.1/31-2/1/95-138-

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  This  is  not a hostile  question.  I can  imagineyour coming  back with a  list  that  I would be perfectly happy with  andnot have  the  slightest bit  of  a problem.  I can also imagine  a  listthat  I would not be  happy with.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We  can have a  situation where  we arerequired to  oversee  and enforce  and where there  is  no way  for  us  toknow what  it  is.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Exactly.  I would like  to  attach some  urgencyto  that  request.  Several  of us  were buzzing  informally about  thataround here.  The  longer it  reverberates  in the press--that  theFederal  Reserve  will  do  this  or will  do  that--the worse  it  gets,  if  wedo not want  to  do it.  If  we do  want  to do  it,  that  is  all  perfectlyfine.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let's  find out what  this  is.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Let me  give  you a  two-part  answer.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  As  a sidebar  to  the question,  I would like  toknow, and hopefully  this  could be  known soon,  when it  says,  "theFederal  Reserve  will  monitor" whether  that means  the Board ofGovernors of  the  Federal  Reserve,  the  Chairman  of  the Board ofGovernors of  the  Federal  Reserve,  the  Federal  Open Market  Committee,or maybe some  other choice.  I can't  imagine  any other  choice.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think  there are  a  lot  of  things we  aregoing to  have  to  decide  today  or very quickly.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I really would  like  to  know  the  answer  to  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  first  thing  I am planning to  doafter  this meeting  is  to  address  that  question by  talking  to  theTreasury and others  involved  in the process.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  The  second question--I guess  this  really  is  aquestion--is  just  for  information since we are  at  least peripherallyinvolved as  an  agent.  Do we have  any understanding of what  theputative strategy is?  Presumably, when  someone goes  into  a deal  likethis,  there  is  some  notion of  a strategy.  Of  the  $20  billion, $6billion is  our  share  and that  is  presumably usable by  the  Bank ofMexico  for exchange  stabilization,  if  it  so  sees  fit.  Then  there  isthe  $14  billion that  could take  the  form of  loan  guarantees;  it  alsocould also be  used for  exchange stabilization;  it  could be used forlong-term  lending.  Maybe  I left  something out,  but  those  are  thethree  things  on the  Treasury sheet.  The legislative plan was  $40billion and  that was  for  loan guarantees.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  On  the  legislative plan,  there was  still  thequestion  of  what the Mexicans  were going  to  do with the money.  Ithink  this  is  a question similar  to  the  one  that  President Minehan wasasking  earlier:  How are  they going  to  use  the money, whether  thefunds  are  short-term or  longer-term funds?  That  is  where  it  seems  tome the  financial plan  that  I referred to  earlier  comes  in.  And it  isrelated  to  the  question about our  involvement  in  the  monitoring of  theeconomic policy  side.  Indeed, the  major rationale  for our  beinginvolved in  the monitoring of  the  economic policy side  is  that without1/31-2/1/95-139-that  involvement,  we could advance  them  the money--whether it's  forthe  short  term, medium term,  or  long term, and  the money could easilybe  frittered  away.  The  two  interact.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  That only bothers  us  directly if  we pledge  tomonitor  something  so  that  something does  not happen.  But  the  Treasuryis  lending money, and  for political  reasons  we  are not.  We have noresponsibility  for monitoring;  I don't  think we have  any business withit.  I can name  eighty-seven  things  in U.S.  trade policies  that  Ithink are  horrible, but  those are political  decisions that  havenothing to  do with  the Federal  Reserve.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  I can name eighty-seven,  too.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  You can name  more than  eighty-seven!

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Still,  even  if  those  trade  policies  go wrong,when  they do go wrong, their  impact  on  the  Federal  Reserve  or  thefinancial  system  is  relatively minor.  If Mexico has  economic  andfinancial policies  that go wrong  for  the next millenium, or moreimmediately for  the next  two  or three  years,  I  think that  will  have amajor  impact  on  the Federal  Reserve,  whether it  is  wearing  its  bank-supervisory hat  or its  financial-system-stability hat,  or  itsmacroeconomic-policy hat.  I think  the  Federal  Reserve  has  to  beconcerned about  how the  Mexican Treasury spends  the money, one way orthe  other.  I would prefer  that  our  concern not be put  in  neon lights,but  I think we have  to  be concerned.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN. I agree on your  firstquestion  that  I do not have  a answer.  I will  tell  you one  smallelement  of  this,  however--or give you my position.  With respect  tothe  International Monetary Fund, we  are  in  a  somewhat similarposition, though  on a slightly different  scale, as  we  are  relative  tothe Congress.  The  International Monetary  Fund got  itself  into  thissituation essentially in  December.  They realized  that  they knew lessabout what was  going on  in Mexico  than we  did.  We knew a great  dealless  than we  wished we had known, even  though we  had  devoted aconsiderable  amount  of  resources  to  this  on  a daily basis  for  at  leastthe  last year.  What  the  IMF does know  is  that  Peter Fisher and hiscolleagues as  well  as  people  here at  the  Board have  much bettercontacts  and information about  the  day-to-day operations  in Mexicothan the  Fund has.  That  is  for  two  reasons:  First  of  all,  the  Fund,for better or worse,  does  not have  a culture  that  is  designed tofollow day-to-day developments  in  the  individual  economies of  membernations.  Secondly,  on  the other side,  the Mexicans are worldchampions  in  terms  of  obfuscating about  economic  information whilesimultaneously providing a  lot of  other information.  Transparency ofthe  way economic  policy is  conducted  in Mexico,  including monetarypolicy,  is  a very serious problem, and it  is  one  that  relates  to  thecomment  earlier  about  the  functioning  of  financial markets  as  well  ascomments--what Governor  Lindsey was  asking about yesterday--concerningthe  balance sheet  of  the Bank of Mexico  from  top  to  bottom.1/31-2/1/95-140-To extend Chairman Greenspan's  analogy  a step  further--maybeI am taking  it  a step back--once we have put  the  house  fire out,  wewant  to  build a more  fire-proof house  and we want  to  try to  encouragethe  resident  of  the  house  to  stop  smoking or  at  least  to  stop smokingin bed.  I think we have  an interest  in getting  it  done,  not  that  weare going to  create a mistake-proof  economic  environment  in Mexico  anymore  than we  can create  a mistake-proof  economic  environment  in  theUnited  States.  We  can hope that  with some effort  and a considerableexpenditure of  Federal  Reserve resources--I mean human  resources  andbudgetary resources  in one  sense--to  fix things  so  that  at  least wewill  not have  these problems  coming  back.Let me  come back  to  another point  on resources.  I share,  forall  the  reasons  Governor Blinder has  stated, the  concerns  about whatwe will  monitor and how we will  monitor because  this will  have, amongother things,  resource  implications  for  the  Federal  Reserve  System.  Iwant  to  know whether  I am going  to  have to  budget  one man year orforty-two man years  to  get  this  job done right.  We  need  to  know atthe minimum what we  are  going  to be  asked to  do,  and see  whether it  isfeasible  to  do  it  both in  terms of  resources and, as  Governor  Lindseyand  the Chairman  have  said,  in  terms  of  the  intellectual  feasibility.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I had  two points:  the big  "P"political point  and the  small  "p" political point.  First,  I findmyself  uncomfortable  disagreeing with you.  Pat  Buchanan had  a goodquote  in  The Wall  Street Journal  the  other day.  He  was  talking aboutthe  collapse  of  the Mexican bailout bill.  He  said that  this  was  thefirst  complete  rout of  the  governing elite  since  the  League  of  Nationswent  down  to  defeat.  Now, I was  for  the Mexican bailout.  If  I hadbeen here  in  1919,  I probably would have been  for  the League  ofNations.  So,  I am on  the  side  of  the  governing elite.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Pat Buchanan  is  with the  governingelite,  too.  What  is  he  doing?

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Well,  he  is  running  against us.  Our politicalrisk  is  not  going  to  come  from the  chairmen and  the  senior members  ofthe  current majority.  Our political  risk comes  because people  in  thecountry are damn mad.  A bill  that  they opposed was defeated, and nowthe  governing elite, to use  Pat Buchanan's phrase,  has  said in  effect:We  are going  to win anyway  because we are going  to  go  around all  thenormal processes and pull  money out  of  this  little pot people neverknew even  existed and use  that  money.  Well,  maybe everyone willforget  about  it,  but  I don't  think  so.  I think that  is  where--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  They will  if  it works  and  they won't  ifit  does  not work.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  If  it  does  not work we--and I cannot  imagine  agreater governing elite group  than this  institution--and all  governingelites  are  going to  be under  a microscope.  I very much  agree with thepoint made  earlier  that  because we are  so obviously an  elite,  if  theelites  come  under question,  then our  functions  are  going  to  be  revisedby Congress.  Our political  risk  in this  is  enormous.1/31-2/1/95-141-The  second point  I would make is  that,  frankly, givenexamples  such as  the  Camdessus memo, we  have been  treated--to borrow aphrase--a  lot  like mushrooms.  The only thing we can do  about that,  Ithink,  is  to  maximize what  little bargaining power  we have  when wehave  it.  We  happen to  have  the maximum bargaining power right now.Once we  approve  these  two documents, which  I have no problem with inthemselves, we  have no bargaining power  left.  So,  I would modify thepace at which Governor  Blinder said we should do  things and  requestthat we get  answers  to  those questions before  we  ratify  this.  Now, wecould even make  the motion  that we  approve  these  subject  to  gettingthe  "third page,"  to  use your phrase.  But  once we approve  these,  wehave no more bargaining power, and  the people who  are  committing uswithout our consent have  unlimited  capacity to  commit us  to  morethings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I disagree with that.  I think ourbargaining power has  not changed.  I think our bargaining power  isessentially our  ability to  say that we will  not engage  in,  we  will notaccept,  the monitoring of  x,  y,  or  z.  We have  a veto  on what  it  is.These documents  are basically facilitating  the United States  Treasuryand the  United States  government.  Our doing  that  in no way eitherenhances  or reduces  our bargaining power.  I think our bargainingpower is  based  solely on  our ability  to  say no.  If  we  say no  or saywe will  not do  such and  such,  our ultimate  leverage  against  theTreasury is  that  there  is  nothing  they can do  about  that,  becausestarting with the  original  hypothesis,  the reason we are  involved  isbecause  of our  credibility.  But  I really don't  think we  get anybargaining power  from  this  because,  from the point  of  view of  theTreasury,  they are  giving  something to  us  in  this  deal,  not  the  otherway  around.  They are  removing the modest  degree  of credit  risk thatwe have under  the existing  arrangement.  The  only thing that  they haveseen in  this  agreement  is  that  they are  acquiescing  in  removing allfinancial  risk  from the  central  bank for  this  deal.  But  if  they thinkby doing that  we  are going  to  acquiesce  in all  the  individual  items,  Iwould just  commit to  everyone  here  that  I will  say  "no."  And  I don'tsee  what  they could do about  it.  I would not hold the  approval ofthese proposals up;  I am willing to  go  along;  I agree.  These  twodocuments are  in  our  favor,  not  the  other way around.  I would be  alittle  concerned about holding  these  documents up  because  I do  notlike  the  fact  that we  are  sitting  out  there with  a half  billion dollarexposure with alleged  "collateral."  Let  us  get  that behind us.President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman, just  very briefly, I certainlyrespect  your point  of  view, and I think I understand  fully  the  verydifficult position that  you  and the  System have been put  in.  I takethat  in consideration.  But  I still  just  have  to  make  a brief  commentin general  support  of  Tom Melzer's position and Larry Lindsey'sposition.  I am just very uncomfortable with this.  I am  sure  that,  asa formal  matter, what we  are proposing to  do  is  legal.  But  as  I seeit,  this  action--the whole package--is  by any reasonable definition insubstance a  fiscal  action, not  a monetary policy action.  It  istherefore the province  of  the Congress.  The Congress  did not have  thewill  to  take  what  I think we  all  agree was  the  appropriate action,  sowe are  being  left  holding the bag.  I guess  I just  see  it  as  a raid  onour independence,  and I regret  it.  I agree with you  that  the risk  tous,  while  I think  it  is  substantial,  is  probably remote,  although  I'mnot  sure  I think  it  is  as  remote  as  you  do.1/31-2/1/95-142-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I'm not  sure  I think it  is  as  remote  asI think it  is  either!  [Laughter]  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  My question  is  not meant  to  reflect  on  thesetwo propositions  because I actually agree with them.  But what wouldhappen  if  the  Fed did not  go along  either with the  increase  to  $6billion or  the warehousing?  Is  the  Treasury contemplating  covering  itand  going elsewhere  for  their warehousing?  What would be  themechanics?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  As  a technical matter,  if  we  declined  to  do  thewarehousing or pulled out  of  the  existing swap agreement,  leavingaside  for  the moment  just  hypothetically that  we  are  already  involvedfor  $4.5  billion, the  Treasury presumably would do  it  all  alone!  Ourcollateral would be  improved by this  arrangement, but  let's  suppose  wewere  starting from square  one,  and  square one  probably has  us  goingback  to  about  1967,  and we  had never had  any dealings with Mexico.They are all  going to  be  done via  the  State  Department and  theTreasury Department.  Then  the  Treasury would take  $20  billion and doit  all  directly without having  us as  a  temporary junior partner  on  theswap  side of  it.  On  the warehousing  side  of  it,  in  principle,  theTreasury could  find other  means  to move  that  $20  billion  in  foreignexchange  off  their  balance  sheet.  It  would be  obvious  that  they didthat  and  that  we  had said  "no."  But  in principle  they could do  it.As  the Chairman suggested, perhaps  they  could do  it  by warehousingwith  the Bank of  Japan and the  Bundesbank.  I'm not  quite  sure howthey would do  that,  but  in principle  they could do  it.  In principle,they could warehouse  it  with the  BIS,  and the  BIS  could warehouse  itwith  the  Street.  All  those options  are,  from some  standpoint, maybepreferable as  far as  we are concerned.  I would even  argue  that  theyillustrate  the  fact  that  this  is  a  fairly straightforward  set  offinancial  transactions.  The very  fact  that  it  could be  done  in theprivate  sector  suggests  that  it  is  perhaps  more normal,  or  lessabnormal,  than  some  people  think it  is.  But  in principle  if  we walkaway from both  sides  of  that,  the Treasury would go  ahead  and do  itanyhow.  That's my thought.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, Jerry Jordan, go  ahead.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Last  March when we  entered into  the  agreement  onthe  swaps,  part of  that  agreement was  that  there would be  a  three-country consultation process  quarterly and  so  on.  I certainly do  notfeel  that  I have had  either  the quantity or  the  quality of  informationas  feedback  from whatever consultation was  taking place  to  alert  us  tothe  situation.  So,  as  long  as  this  is  outstanding, I would hope weget  a lot better  information.  It  does  not have  to  come  at  theCommittee table,  but whatever  is  being generated by the New York Bankor  the Board  staff  should be  sent  to  us  so  that  we  are betterinformed.  Part  of  the  reason  I say  that  is  because  I live  on thesouth  shore  of  Lake Erie.  Maybe  if  I had Bob McTeer's  southernborder,  I would  think differently about  it.  But  from where I  sit,  Iworry  about  the  political and economic  situation  to  the  north of  LakeErie very much.  If  we  are not  getting good feedback  on developmentsup  there,1/31-2/1/95-143-

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I'm  sorry you have not had sufficientinformation.  I think  this  upsets everybody;  everybody feels  that way.We  have made  a very serious effort  at  the  staff  level  to  improve  thereports.  You may not read  the weekly reports  from the Federal ReserveBank of  New York but  since  shortly after last  April, when thisconsultation process was  formalized, some  60  percent of  Peter's wordsin that  report have  dealt  with his  consultations with Canada andMexico.  So  we have  put  in  extra resources  to provide  the Committeewith additional information on  the current  financial  situation of bothCanada and Mexico.  It  may not be  enough, but we  have stepped up  ourefforts.The point about  these consultations  is  absolutely true and  Iregret  that personally.  I called the Treasury and asked about  it  andrecommended that  we call a meeting of  the North American FinancialGroup in  early September to  discuss  Mexico's exchange  rate policy andtheir  strategy.  They said  "no."  The next  time,  I would  try to enlistthe  Chairman of  the  Federal Reserve  in doing that,  which might be  mynormal  inclination anyhow.  I just  resisted it  this  time.  I think weshould have used that  mechanism beforehand because  that  in  fact wasone  of  the reasons  that  we  insisted  it be  set up.  Having agreed to  goup  to  a $3 billion swap  line  from  the previous  $700  million swap  line,that was  to be  part  of  the  quid pro  quo. more  tightly bound because  of  the  financing arrangements, we wouldhave a mechanism that  we  could be more  comfortable about.  You areperfectly  justified in  feeling  snookered.  We  all were  snookered.  Iapologize  to  the  extent  that we  could have minimized  that,  but we willtry harder.So  if  we were going  to  be

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, it's  a legal  requirement.1/31-2/1/95-144-

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  If  the Committee  decides  to  keep  the  swap  lineat  $4-1/2  billion,  the  Treasury understands  that.  The Chairman madeit  very clear  in his  conversation at  the  Treasury that  we  might  stayat  $4-1/2  billion.  If  the  $4-1/2  billion  is  where  the Committee wantsto  draw the  line,  that  is  where  it  can draw  the  line.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let  me just  say  that when  the  issue wasraised with me,  I said  that  I did not have an  FOMC vote  and  that  I didnot know how  the FOMC  was going  to  come  out.  I indicated that  onepossibility was  that  the  FOMC would keep  the  swap line  at  $4-1/2billion.  I said  I would request  an  increase, because  I thought  thatwas  the  right  thing to  do.  But  I in no  way suggested that  I knew howthe vote  was  going  to  come out.
