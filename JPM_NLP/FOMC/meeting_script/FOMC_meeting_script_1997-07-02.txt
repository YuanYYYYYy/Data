CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I have the gavel  that was used  for Federal  ReserveBoard meetings  in  1914.  I was going to bring it in for this meeting,  but it appears to be fragileeven though it looks more  like a weapon  than anything else.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Mr. Chairman,  have wood mites  attacked it?  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It looks more like  attacks by the Congress  than woodmites.Regrettably,  this is the  last meeting  for Rick Mishkin  who, much to the  dismay of theVice Chairman,  is going back to Columbia  University.  I thought he had just arrived.  Whether  ornot that is  the case,  we  will miss you and we wish you  well.  I  suspect that you have learnedsomething about chaos theory from these meetings.  [Laughter]I will  start off as usual by requesting approval  of the minutes.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Mr. Fisher, you are on.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  In the memo that presents  some  of the  options for dealing withtopic of returning to lagged reserve  requirements  from the current  contemporaneous  reserverequirements  regime.  There was a reference  in that document to the preparation  of anothermemorandum.7/1-2/97Could you  elaborate  on that in terms of whether that paper will be  a discussion memorandum  ora decision-oriented  memorandum.  Where are  you  on that issue?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I would be happy to refer to Don and his staff on that.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Board staff is working  on a memorandum  for Board consideration  thatproposes  a return to lagged reserve accounting.  The Board has not seen any  of this or heard  thisdiscussed previously because  we  are  still working on this issue at the staff level.  I think there  aretwo factors  that  make this  a potentially opportune time to consider this issue.  One is that asreserve  balances  have dropped, we  have had increasing  difficulties predicting  required  reservebalances  from week to week.  The reason is that vault cash has been high enough to enable  somebanks  to shift back and forth between  being bound by reserve  requirements and not.  The previousformulas that were used to predict which banks were  going to be bound and which were not nolonger work.  We have  tried to improve these predictions,  and I think we have.  The errors havedropped substantially,  but it is still more difficult to make predictions  about demands  for reservebalances  in an environment  in which we cannot even be certain that  one or another major largebank will be bound by reserve requirements.  Secondly,  the Federal Reserve  System  is in theprocess of changing  the programming  and accounting regime  for reserve requirements,  and itwould be relatively easy to allow  for a shift back to lagged reserve  accounting once thatprogramming  is completed.  Previously,  we were  told that it would be a major undertaking  to gointo the reserve  accounting  system and  change it from contemporaneous  to lagged  accounting.The implementation of the new accounting system, which I think will occur about a year from7/1-2/97now, would be  an opportune  moment  to shift back to lagged reserves.  As  I mentioned, we aregoing to come  to  the Board  with a proposal  on that.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  As you know,  this is an  issue that has been debated  at length atvarious  times.  We have had  both regimes.  We had contemporaneous  reserves  before the late1960s, when we went to lagged reserve  requirements.  As we got into the monetary  aggregatesapproach  to policy,  we shifted back to contemporaneous  reserves.  I think this  is more than  atechnical issue.  It has implications  for how  monetary policy is implemented  or the perception  ofhow it is  implemented.  I hope  that this will not be  treated  as just a technical  issue.  It ought to betalked about  in the broader  context  of monetary  policy rather than in terms of accountingchanges.  It is a worthwhile  debate  to have,  and we  ought to have  it in that broader context.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  When  we get  there,  why don't we bring it to theCommittee  as  a subject  for general discussion, presuming  that  something materializes  out ofwhat the staff is  working  on at the moment?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I agree very much  with what  Ed Boehne just said.  It would seemto be especially  appropriate  to discuss that in a  situation where  it is possible  that M2  may becoming  back on track.  Lagged reserve  accounting precludes  the use of any  sort of reserveoperating instrument  in my opinion,  and such  an instrument might be a more desirable  option inthis kind of situation.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I would underscore  that  the paper, particularly  the decision  tree thatshows the  different options,  is not intended  to be technical  or to bury this issue in the details.Don and I were trying to lay this out so you would see all the steps we  think need to be  gonethrough before  you reach any of what  we deem to be  the important policy choices  at  the bottom7/1-2/97of the decision tree,  as  it were,  and perhaps  along the way.  I hope no one  looks at this paper  astaking any  of these issues  and burying them.  Rather, we  are trying to let you see, with  as muchadvance notice as  we can give, the  full scope of the possible  changes that might be envisaged asa potential  answer to the  low  operating balances problem.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think President Broaddus  is raising an  interestingissue.  If the M2  data eventually suggest that there  may be some particular  policy use  for M2, thewhole concept of reserves  in the structure  of monetary  operations,  especially  in the context of thesignificant  decline in required reserves,  will become more  than a technical  question.  I think wewill have  to be very careful  about how that plays  out.  We do not want to start moving  in onedirection  and find that we have  to backtrack because  of factors we did not  foresee.  My guess isthat it would  be very  premature  to consider the issue at this stage, but I would not rule out thepossibility that it may become  a significant question in 6 months,  18  months; I do not knowprecisely  when.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  As  you and President Broaddus  remember, the reserve requirements  aregeared to Ml, and there are no reserve requirements  on non-M1  deposit balances.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think that is precisely the issue in the sense that if wego back to M2 and stay with reserves  on transaction balances, something  is incoherent.  At themoment, it doesn't matter all that much.  But it would if we began  to  take the M2 cone  seriously.Any other questions?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I have  one.  I agree  with the general  thrust of the views that have justbeen  expressed.  One of the options on the decision tree would be to lower reserve requirementsand increase  the deposit base to which they apply.  It would be exactly in that circumstance that I7/1-2/97think the  point the Chairman  is making would be relevant.  I just want to make the  generalcomment  that I am glad the  staff has undertaken  this analysis  of the implications  and possibleresponses  to the decline  in operating balances.  I  am sure  that everyone  shares  this view.  Wehave  to be concerned  about excessive  volatility in  the  federal  funds rate, but I think somevolatility is  actually quite desirable  from a market  discipline point of view,  particularly asrequired  reserves become  a less important driver of the  demand for federal  funds.  We reallywant institutions to have the incentive to hold appropriate balances  to settle  transactions,  and  theprice they would pay in a very  stable funds market might not be sufficient  to create the kind  ofincentives  that we would like to  see in that process.  I know that, as market people, this issomething you are  well aware  of, and we  should keep it in mind as we think about these issues.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions for Peter?  If not, would someone liketo move  ratification  of the domestic operations?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  So  moved.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Without objection  they are  approved.  Letus move  on now to the  Chart Show.

[SECTION]

MR. SLIFMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We will be referring  to the packet  ofmaterial  titled "Staff Presentation  to the Federal Open  Market  Committee."  Dave  Stockton, TedTruman,  and I will jointly  share the honors  this afternoon.  [Statements--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you, gentlemen.  That was  a very thoroughevaluation.  Questions  for anybody?  [Pause]  I cannot believe it was that thorough!

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  With regard to the table  in the  middle  of chart 5  showing  output gaps,could you give me the memo item for  the United  States, Mike?  I assume  it would  be about  1.07/1-2/97percent  above potential  for the fourth quarter of  1996.  What was the  fourth quarter of  1998 inthe  Greenbook?

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  The Greenbook estimate for the fourth quarter  of 1998  is 2.1percent  above potential.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  2.1  percent and  1.0 percent roughly for the fourth quarter  1996?

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  We have  .8  percent above potential  for the fourth quarter of 1996.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Okay.  With regard to my other question,  it is  obvious that what ishappening at Boeing  has a big impact on BFI and  also on the export number.  Are there anylimits on their  ability to produce?

[SECTION]

MR.  SLIFMAN.  I think they purposely  have chosen to stretch  out deliveries,  as theyhave  done in  the past,  because they know  a bust will inevitably  follow  the boom.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  To piggyback on the  aircraft  question, we really  do not have  aprecise view of what is  going on.  I mentioned that the aircraft  shipments have picked up overthe last two quarters.  The information  that we have,  where we have some slippage  goingforward, is that their foreign component  is leveling off rather than continuing to rise.  A largerfraction of what  is shown on that  chart, at least for the next 5  or 6 months,  is  going into thedomestic  side of BFI.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Of  BFI?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Yes,  as best we can piece these things together.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions?7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Just a quick question  about the projected  stock market correction.What is the real  impact of that?  How much does that negatively  affect your GDP figures  for nextyear?

[SECTION]

MR.  SLIFMAN.  We have not quantified it, as I  suggested in my remarks,  but wethink it will  have  a relatively modest negative effect  with a lag on consumer spending in  1998.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Are declining  equity prices basically the major drag that you haveembedded  in your figures for next year?

[SECTION]

MR. SLIFMAN.  No.  We  anticipate that the slowing  of activity will result primarilyfrom some stock  adjustments  following the large increases  in investment  spending in  recentyears.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  On both the consumer  and business  sides?

[SECTION]

MR. SLIFMAN.  Right, in both consumer spending  and business investment.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Let me emphasize  that this  is partly a matter of the peculiarity  of thetiming.  We really don't like to attempt to  pin down  the dimension, let alone the  timing, of thisadjustment.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  But we had to do this.  We have it starting essentially at the  end of thisyear and continuing  relatively steadily  through  1998.  Given  the normal lags  estimated for thewealth effects,  we will not see a lot of the impact until the very end of the period and in  1999.That is  why it does not loom so large.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Anybody else?  Incidentally, Mike  Prell has indicatedthat you can have through Monday, July 7,  for any revisions  to your  individual forecasts  for theHumphrey-Hawkins  report.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I have one quick question:  Dave,  on chart  15--I may be the onlyone in the room who had a little trouble  following all  of this--why does the nominal  funds rate  inthat alternative  unemployment targeting  simulation have to go up more rapidly?  I presume youare keeping  employment constant  while productivity is increasing.

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  Yes,  but the reason is  that you  need to raise rates  earlier in thatepisode because  you are trying to keep the unemployment  rate constant.  If you  did not do that,the strength in demand  actually would  outweigh in some sense the increase  in supply.  There  is abigger  effect in our models in terms of investment demand  and consumer  spending that actuallycauses the net effect of this improvement  in productivity to be expansionary  for the economy.The improvement  would tend to drive down the unemployment  rate in the absence  of a rise inrates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If there  are no further questions,  would somebody liketo start the meeting discussion?  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic  activity remains  strong  in theKansas  City District,  with only a few  signs of slowing.  Our directors and  other business  contactsreport solid economic  growth throughout  the District.  Retail sales have been robust andmanufacturing remains  quite healthy.  Two strikes  that I mentioned at our last meeting haveended satisfactorily, with some 4,200 or so workers back to work.  Conditions have continued  toimprove in  the District's  farm and energy sectors.  The District's wheat harvest  is under way and7/1-2/97expectations  are that we will have the largest crop  since  1994.  Also, cattle prices  have improvedand ranchers  are now making  modest profits.  In the energy sector, drilling  activity registeredanother small gain in May despite  some decline in  oil and gas  prices.  Tempering  some of thepositive  economic news for our District, construction  activity has tended to level off and totalemployment  fell  slightly in April even  after adjustment for strikes.Retail prices  are  holding steady in the Kansas  City District, but labor markets  are  tightand we continue  to hear  reports of wage  pressures.  Many firms  continue to have difficulty fillingentry-level  positions  and  hiring skilled workers.  Our quote of the month  is from one of ourdirectors  in Southern  Oklahoma who reported  that labor markets were so tight in  his town thateveryone  was working who wanted  to and some  were working  who did not want to.  [Laughter]Several  branch directors  and other respondents  that  we survey  informally reported above normalwage increases  in their markets,  especially  at the entry level.  For example,  the owner of one ofour large retail chains reported that entry-level  wages  have increased  somewhere  in theneighborhood  of 10 percent plus  over the last year.  However, this rate of increase  is spotty;  wedo not see wages  pressing up at those rates uniformly  across the District.On the national front, despite  the more moderate  pace of growth  in the  second quarter,the  economy appears  to be fundamentally strong.  We would  agree with much of what was saidin the Greenbook.  We expect real  GDP growth to  pick up somewhat in the  second half of theyear and then likely move toward trend in  1998.  Consumer  spending  should grow at a relativelystrong pace.  Contributing factors  are  solid employment,  high levels of consumer  confidence,  andsubstantial  gains in the stock market.  Spending  on business equipment should also remainstrong, rising in response  to corporate profits  and elevated stock prices.  While there is a  great7/1-2/97deal  of uncertainty about the inflation  outlook,  and we share  that uncertainty,  our projections foreconomic  activity and those in the Greenbook  certainly  suggest  that the inflation risks  remain  onthe upside.  We  continue to be  sensitive to those risks  in our  analysis of the economy.  With thatI will stop, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  Twelfth District economic  growth  has been vigorousthus far in  1997.  Payroll  employment  expanded  by 3  percent  at an  annual rate during the  firstfour months of the year and probably  in May as  well.  That rate is only slightly  below last year'space.  The  durable  goods manufacturing  sector has performed particularly  well, as strongdemand has  continued for high-tech products  and for materials related to aircraft  production.California's  economy is fully on track,  with the state currently  ranking  seventhnationally in its pace  of payroll job creation.  Los  Angeles  is now sharing fully in the  state'seconomic  success.  Employment growth  in LA  County has accelerated  substantially  this year,and the county's unemployment  rate has declined  about  1-1/2 percentage  points over the past  12months to 6.8 percent.Five other District  states are ranked  among the top  seven nationally  in their yearlyrates  of payroll job creation.  After accelerating  substantially  last year, the Washington  Stateeconomy has  settled into a solid growth  path.  Although economic  expansions in the fast growthintermountain  states and Oregon  have  slowed only  slightly in  1997, those states remain  on stronggrowth  paths with stable or declining unemployment  rates.  Even Hawaii  has  shown signs  thisyear of reversing  its several-year pattern  of employment declines.7/1-2/97Sustained and  rapid expansion has caused  rising inflation in many areas  of the District.In the San Francisco  Bay area, sharp acceleration  in prices  of services  led to rising consumerprice inflation  in  1996  and early  1997.  Inflation in other strong  growth  areas of the District alsoincreased  in  1996  and is likely to rise further  this year.Turning to the national  economy,  recent data have confirmed  that growth in economicactivity  has slowed markedly,  probably to  a rate around 2 percent  in the second quarter, which  isa little lower  than the  Greenbook projection.  Although  our forecast  shows  growth picking up inthe second  half of this  year, it drops back to a more sustainable pace  in  1998.  I think there are  anumber of factors  restraining  prospective  growth,  but the economy's  rapid expansion  over thepast year or so has left it operating  at a noticeably  higher level  according  to our traditionalmeasures  of capacity such  as the rate of unemployment,  rates of capacity utilization, and theGDP  gap.These indicators  provide  good reasons  to  be concerned  about the  future trend ofinflation, and the lags in policy  mean that we must be forward-looking.  In this  regard,  I amconcerned  about the  indications  of excess demand  for resources.  This situation raises two  keyquestions  that are very difficult to resolve.  First, are  our estimates  of capacity  accurate,  andsecond,  given  those capacity  estimates, is the  economy's growth likely to slow enough and  for along  enough period of time to eliminate  any inflationary  pressure that may exist?  In balancingthese uncertainties,  my best judgment is that underlying inflation  will  show an upward  trend.For the GDP price index, our forecast  indicates  an increase  of around  2-1/4 percent  this year  and2-3/4  percent in  1998.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  economic conditions  in the Midwest  remain quitesimilar to those I reported at the May meeting.  Our regional  economy is  still expanding  at amodest rate,  and District manufacturers  and retailers  continue  to report  that competitivepressures  inhibit their ability to raise prices.  Our manufacturing  sector is still  operating  at veryhigh levels.  The Chicago Purchasing Managers'  Survey results, released  on Monday,  showed asharp increase  in the composite  index to 61.5  in June  from 56.8  in May, indicative  of a pickup inthe rate  of expansion in the manufacturing  sector.  Contacts report  strong activity in  a number ofindustries  including  steel,  heavy  trucks, cement,  gypsum board,  and agricultural  and other heavyequipment.  However, a large national paper  manufacturer  headquartered in the District reportedslow growth in shipments of containerboard  and noted that they are reducing capacity  bytemporarily closing two plants.In terms  of consumer  spending trends,  retailers  indicated that the sales  slowdownevident in April and  May continued through  much of June.  However,  sales improvedsignificantly  in the latter part of June when warm weather finally  arrived.  To illustrate theadverse impact  of the cold weather, one very large national  retailer headquartered  in our Districtnoted that on a year-to-date  basis,  unit sales of air conditioners were down 38 percent comparedto last year.  This retailer  also reported that sales of white  goods  were flat year-to-date;  they arenow taking a more conservative  approach  to the second  half of the year.  Contacts in the truckingindustry reported  that shipments  of new merchandise  to retailers  nationwide  had slowed from thefirst quarter.  This probably indicates  attempts by retailers to keep  inventories  in line  with theslower sales pace.  Information  from the auto industry suggests  that reports on light vehicle sales7/1-2/97to be released this week probably  will show  June sales  at an  annual rate of around  14.8  or  14.9million units,  which would be consistent  with what is implied in the Greenbook  forecast.Our labor markets  are still  very tight.  The unemployment rate  for District states  was4.1  percent  in April  for the third straight month and then fell to 3.8 percent in  May.  Despite tightlabor markets, we  still have not  seen much upward pressure  on wages,  although reports aremixed.  Contacts  at one  large national retailer  said they still are  not having difficulty  attractingworkers,  and  a recent labor settlement  with the  UAW calls for a 50 percent reduction  in wagesand benefits  for new hires at a foundry, resulting  in a two-tier wage  structure.  In contrast,another retail chain increased  wages  10 percent and is still having trouble getting  workers.  Alarge phone company is seeing upward pressure  on wages,  particularly for marketing  andmanagerial people.  In the trucking industry,  one  firm's 33  percent increase  in truck driver wagesthat went into effect  in February of this year was not enough to attract as many drivers  as theyneeded, so they have  started advertising  for drivers.  Other trucking firms  have raised wagesconsiderably,  with the  increase in the industry being  about  10 to  15  percent.Turning to the national  outlook, since  we met in May new data have confirmed  ourview that growth slowed considerably in the second  quarter from its first-quarter pace.  Further,we have had more good news on the price front,  as the CPI rose only  .1 percent in  May.However, if anything, labor  markets now appear tighter than we previously  anticipated, and wecurrently have  a positive  output gap.  Our forecast of growth near trend over the next fewquarters  will only maintain the gap  and not shrink it.  Consequently, we  see a significant risk thatthe economy is operating beyond its long-term potential  and that underlying inflationarypressures will worsen  gradually over the next few quarters,  though these pressures  may be7/1-2/97masked somewhat by the favorable developments  in food  and energy prices  and by continuedBLS implementation  of methodological  improvements  in the  CPI.  Furthermore,  though we  andthe public may have been pleased with keeping  inflation  at or under 3 percent in the last fewyears, we must ratchet  down this threshold  to about  2-1/2 percent now just to keep up with theBLS changes  that remove, little by little, some of the measurement  bias in the CPI.With the new benchmark  in  mind, I find the Chicago  Bank forecast  for inflation  andthe Greenbook  forecast as well quite  troubling both in terms of the projected  levels  of inflationand the upward tilt to  its future  path.  We all know  that a gradual  acceleration  of inflation isdifficult to detect in real time and that any actions  we take today will not affect inflation in theshort run.  But we also  know that an inflation  rate that is gradually, even  gently, moving up is notmoving us any closer to  anyone's  definition of price  stability.  The risks in our forecast  and inthe Greenbook  as well clearly  are tilted toward the upside.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  the New  England economy continues  to expand.The annual rate  of job growth now rather closely matches  that of the  nation as a whole, butwithin the region  considerable  state-by-state  variation is  evident.  Massachusetts  is now thefastest growing New England  state, at least as measured by job growth,  outstripping NewHampshire  by nearly  a full percentage point.  After New Hampshire,  Connecticut  is a close third,while Maine,  Vermont,  and Rhode Island have had relatively  slower rates of job growth.  NewEngland employment is dominated by at least four large  sectors:  high-tech, defense,  education,and financial  services.  The  financial services  sector  is booming  as is high-tech.  Educationremains  relatively stable, but defense  has endured  major reductions in the last several  years.7/1-2/97Work  conducted  recently  at the Federal Reserve  Bank  of Boston suggests that, while Pentagoncontracts  have declined,  some  formerly defense-oriented  companies  are  starting to expand theiremployment as  a result of opportunities in commercial  markets.  This is especially true inMassachusetts  and  New Hampshire  where the most flexible defense  businesses  appear to  belocated.  By contrast, Connecticut and Maine  suffer  as a result  of the inflexibility of theirsubmarine and other shipbuilding  industries.At a recent  panel discussing labor shortages  in New  England, we  were told that theMassachusetts  software  industry has grown  from about 800 companies  with revenues  of about $3billion in  1989  to over 2,000 companies  employing  130,000 people and having revenues  ofnearly $10  billion in  1996.  More than 73 percent of Massachusetts  software  companies  areplanning to  add jobs in  1997, and  one of the biggest  issues the industry  faces is the laborshortage,  not just locally but nationally.  Massachusetts  software companies  are said to be  facingthe tightest labor market in a decade,  with unfilled  positions a problem  not just in old mainframecompanies  but in  the hottest Internet  companies as  well.  Over the short term, companies  areusing higher bonuses  to attract and  retain personnel, increasing  benefits  such as  portablevacations and  family-friendly work environments,  courting retired and  laid-off workers,  andgranting  financial  awards to existing employees  who recruit new  employees.  Over the  longerterm, there simply will  have to be more high-tech  graduates from local and  national colleges  tomeet the demand we see in  Massachusetts  and  nationally.During  much of the last two or three years,  loan growth  at First District institutionshas trailed that of the nation  due at least in part to the effects  of mergers  and restructurings butalso to concerted  attempts to manage  balance  sheets and organizations  to eliminate  low earning7/1-2/97assets, restrain  costs, and  improve  efficiency  ratios.  Large  First District banks  now appear to beembracing  loan growth  as a means  of increasing net income,  and they have  become  intensecompetitors  locally  and nationally, especially for commercial and  industrial  loans.  Theycommented  recently  about the narrowing  of spreads  and weakening  of loan covenants that theyhave  observed,  though they maintained  that their own commitment  to loan quality remains  firmafter the lessons of the  1980s.  They also report that a tremendous  amount of liquidity is beingsupplied  by nontraditional middle market  lenders--Merrill  Lynch, for example.Finally, let me say  a few words  about the  tightening of commercial  real estate  markets.We  saw a graph  in the  Chart Show that looked  at that development.  We  see this especially  inBoston.  The vacancy  rate for Class A office  space is now below  5  percent,  and per-square-footrental  rates are at levels just below the  peaks of the  late  1980s.  It is not occurring just in Boston.We  did a survey that indicates that  other New  England  cities are  experiencing  declining  vacancyrates, as are a number of cities around  the country--San  Francisco,  Seattle,  Charlotte, just toname  a few.  So far, "spec"  building has not begun in Boston, but it would  seem to be only amatter of time before it starts  both locally and nationally,  given  current  interest rates, liquidity,and both business and consumer  optimism.On the national  scene, it is interesting to compare the Greenbook forecast with a rangeof other forecasts:  DRI, Georgia  State, Michigan,  and our own.  All  these forecasts  evidence  a lotof similarities in their GDP growth projections  for  1997 and  1998.  The Greenbook is moreoptimistic  about inflation,  as previously  noted;  more importantly,  it paints a picture of decliningunemployment  rates while most of the other forecasts anticipate  increasing rates, with oneshowing no change as I recall.  Thus, while  the numbers  are not far apart, the feel  of the forecasts7/1-2/97differs  quite a bit.  In sum, the other forecasts  see an environment  of slowing growth  and risingunemployment,  spurred  in part by  federal  funds rate increases,  with  some small pickup  ininflation.  The Greenbook,  on the  other hand,  sees falling unemployment,  marginally  strongergrowth, and  a rather similar uptick in  inflation.Why is  the Greenbook so  optimistic  or, to put it another  way, why  is it willing to befurther behind  the curve than  other forecasters  seem to think is  wise?  Some of this optimismcould relate to how wrong we all have been  in our projections  for the  past year or so.  Incomparison  with our Humphrey-Hawkins  forecasts  in February,  our current  forecasts  nowsuggest that GDP will grow faster than the  highest forecast in  the February  range and that boththe CPI and the unemployment  rate will be  lower than the lowest  forecast.  So, collectively,  wehave been wrong.  We have  underestimated  the potential for the economy to grow  and  forunemployment  to fall without serious  inflation damage--in  fact, with  some progress on  theoverall  inflation front.Should  we be a "learning organization"  and  assume that this  experience can  continuethrough  1997 and into  1998?  Or should  we remain  skeptical  that the relationships  that driveother forecasts,  and ours  as  well, will  reassert themselves  sooner rather than later?  It  shouldcome as no  surprise that I am  a bit skeptical.  I am skeptical  because  I believe  the factorsdamping inflation--medical  cost containment,  the value of the  dollar, a restructured  anddownsized  business environment--are  temporary or about reaching  the peak  in terms  of theireconomic impact.As  I look ahead,  I see few,  if any, constraints  on growth.  All  the factors have beenmentioned:  good jobs, high levels of optimism, no particular  fiscal drag, and reasonable  levels of7/1-2/97growth  abroad.  About the only negatives  mentioned in the Greenbook  are the prospects  for astock  market correction and  for consumer and business buying to  moderate because  of stockprice effects.  As I keep  saying, people  in Boston have been telling me  for over a year now thatconsumers can only buy  so many cars  and that  businesses  can only buy  so many computers.However, it has been difficult to see  the effects  of that buildup  in stocks  kicking in as yet, and Iwonder when it will in  1998, given  all the positive factors.  It may be that increases in capacityand moderating  agricultural  and energy prices will  help, but I also think it is wise to be skepticalabout the impact of a  stock market  correction  on the real  economy.  Thus, I would associatemyself most closely with the Greenbook's worry  about a boom/bust scenario,  where we wait toolong and then we need to move too strongly  to attain our objectives.

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  economic  activity in the Fifth District seems  forthe most part to be following the pattern  of the recent national  data.  As in the nation as a whole,consumer spending  was very  strong in our region  over the latter part of last year and the earlypart of this  year, but it clearly  has decelerated in the  second quarter,  especially spending onautomobiles,  other durable  goods,  and apparel.  The question,  of course, for both  our own regionand the national  economy  is whether this deceleration  is a temporary phenomenon  or somethingmore permanent.  Unfortunately,  the recent data and anecdotal  information from our District donot shed much  light on this issue.  Consistent with  some of the comments  in the Greenbookrelating to the national economy,  there have been some  signs of a pickup in retail  activity in ourarea  in the last couple  of weeks, but it is  much too early to know whether that will persist and, if7/1-2/97it does,  how strong it will be going forward.  Certainly, the fundamentals  seem to  be in place  tosupport a reacceleration  of consumer  spending in our region in the  months ahead.Labor markets  remain exceptionally  tight in our District  as they apparently  areelsewhere in  the country.  Jobs and income are  growing  strongly.  I am always a little suspiciousof local unemployment  rates because  I don't  always know how  they are constructed, but theysuggest that unemployment  is very low throughout our region,  and that should help supportconsumer  outlays.  While credit  card charge-offs  have risen fairly significantly  at some banks,that is not the case  at all banks, and we do not see  any significant  constraints  on consumer creditavailability,  at least at this point.  Elsewhere,  residential  construction  is  holding up very well inour region, especially  at the high end of the  market.  There is considerable  speculative  buildingthroughout  the District, especially of upscale new homes.With respect to prices,  the  reports we get are mixed.  Some  of our board memberscommented  at the latest meeting  that there are  signs of outright price moderation.  For example,told us thathis company recently  signed  a contract with an automobile  company that calls  for a 3  percent cutin the prices  of all the items will supply that  company in each of the next  fiveyears.  But there also are  signs of potential upward pressures.  This is consistent with some of thecomments that Mike Moskow was  making.  Several months ago, I commented  here that truckingcompanies  were advertising  for drivers on the mud flaps of their trucks  along 1-95.  At the time,they were  offering  26 cents a mile.  They are  now offering 42 cents a mile, and at the speedsthose guys  drive,  that is a heck of an hourly wage!  [Laughter]7/1-2/97I don't have  a great  deal to say this time about the national  economy.  Our projections,which are based  on a VAR  model modified by judgment, to the extent that  we have  it, [laughter]are  not very different  from the staff baseline forecast.  That is  obviously a very rosy forecast,especially  with the modifications  from the last Greenbook.  But in contrast to the staff, I guesswe  are skeptical  along the lines of Cathy Minehan's comments  and some of the outside forecaststhat she mentioned.  We think that at least a moderate increase  in the funds  rate is likely to berequired soon to achieve  that nice outcome.  Incidentally,  we would not see this as  a tighteningof monetary  policy in any meaningful  sense.  The economy seems  to be experiencing  somethingthat is at least  approaching an investment  boom.  While I think the staff is right to be cautiousabout concluding  in any definite way that the longer-run  trend growth in productivity hasincreased,  there is certainly  a possibility that we may be looking  at a moderate  increase.  As  Isaid at the last meeting,  either of those events would imply a need for higher real  interest rates.With inflation  expectations  basically  stable,  a moderate  increase in  the nominal  funds rate  wouldgive us a moderate increase  in  real interest rates.  Thank you.

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  The Eighth District economy continues  to grow at apace consistent  with national  trends.  Firms  report moderate  gains in sales  and employment,  butwe  often hear that concerns  over labor availability  have put a damper on expansion plans.  Tightlabor markets  are reflected in an  average unemployment  rate of 4.6 percent for District states incompared with three months  earlier.  A survey of 223  small businesses in the District revealedthat about  18  percent plan to increase  sales prices in the months  ahead,  while about 3  percent7/1-2/97plan to  lower prices.  This is consistent  with results  from the  same  survey  a year ago.Year-to-date  sales tax receipts  for District  states are running nearly 5 percent ahead  of the sameperiod one  year ago.  Retailers  in the District remain optimistic  about sales growth  in the  secondhalf of 1997.  Although  results for April  and May  were mixed, many say that  sales growthgenerally  has been in line with expectations  and that current inventories  are at desired levels.While loan  demand  appears  to be slowing at District banks,  many are  still experiencing  double-digit growth rates  in their loans  on a year-over-year  basis.  Some contacts report more  generouslending  terms stemming  from stiff competition,  which is consistent  with the most recent SeniorLoan  Officers Survey  for the nation as a whole.The national  economy is indeed turning in  an impressive  performance.  So far in  1997the economy  has created  an  average  of 229,000  nonfarm payroll jobs per month,  well  aboveprojected longer-term  trends  in labor force  growth.  Consumer  confidence  indices are  at highlevels, and  manufacturing continues  to show  strength.  While retail  sales slumped  over the lastthree months, part  of that reflects adjustments  to exceptionally  strong gains early in the year.  Asthe Greenbook notes,  weekly chain store  sales data indicate  some upturn  in June.  The consumerprice  index has increased  only  1.4 percent  at an annual  rate  over the first five months of this year,down sharply  from the 3.3  percent rate for  all of 1996.  This favorable inflation news  has comeas a surprise relative to most forecasts  made last year, as  Cathy  Minehan  noted.The Committee might  do well to think about ways  these inflation gains  could belocked in.  If markets  had more confidence  that  the Fed was  not satisfied with 3 percent inflation,longer-term  interest  rates might fall in line with the news  on the CPI.  As  it is,  30-year Treasurybonds have  been trading  to yield  about 6.7 to 6.8 percent in recent sessions, actually  up a notch7/1-2/97from  6.6 percent in  the fourth  quarter of 1996.  It appears  that markets  expect inflation torebound later this year,  a  forecast echoed by the Blue Chip consensus.  Their expected  1997 CPIinflation rate is 2.8  percent  as of June  10,  followed by a rate  of 2.9 percent in  1998,  the  same ratethat professional  forecasters  see over a  10-year horizon.  Our St. Louis  forecast, afterincorporating  the good news on  real growth and inflation  for the first quarter of 1997, assumesthe persistence  of the underlying forces  that have  generated  sustained real growth at a rate  ofabout 2-1/2  percent and sustained CPI inflation  at a rate of about 2-1/2  to  3 percent.  Withrespect to CPI inflation, we recognize  that the  experience of the first five months will moderatemeasured  inflation  in 1997,  which we expect will come  in below that observed  in  1996.Nevertheless,  like other  forecasts, ours is for a bounceback in  1998  to the 3  percent rate  that isentrenched  in budgets  and long-term interest rates.  We have assumed  in this regard that theCommittee  will not adopt a  deliberate  strategy to achieve  price stability over some  specified timeperiod.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

MR.  BOEHNE.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  The  Philadelphia District economy  isparalleling the national economy.  Our region  experienced robust  growth in the first quarter,  asdid the nation, and  moderating growth in the second quarter, also like  the nation.  The regionaloutlook is  positive.  There  are tight labor markets  but few, if any,  signs of accelerating  inflation.A major focus of management across  a broad range  of companies is  to contain costs to protectprofit margins  and hold the line on prices.  The major emphasis is to avoid increasing workerhead counts  as production  expands.  Companies are investing in labor-saving  equipment andtechnologies.  For example, in  areas like law and real estate, which we do not often  think about7/1-2/97in terms  of labor-saving  efforts, professionals  are  getting more  done in less time by takingadvantage  of advances  in information processing and telecommunications  equipment.Outsourcing  is also  increasing.  The use of variable pay  and signing bonuses  is becoming evermore present  to meet current  needs while  helping to hold down permanent  increases in employeecompensation.  There  is a huge cultural  shift going on throughout  the District  in the waymanagement  approaches  cost containment,  and its  vigor is still intact.Turning to the nation, we  find ourselves in  a very favorable  situation, just to introducea little joy into these discussions.  [Laughter]  Demand has moderated but it is  still solid, anddevelopments  on the supply  side have been  surprisingly positive.  Producer prices have fallenfor five straight months; the last time that happened  was in  1952.  Consumer prices  are  rising at aslower pace this year than last.  The unemployment  rate is as low as it has been in 24 years.Nonetheless,  there are legitimate  concerns about what might go wrong, particularly  in terms ofoverheating  of the economy and upside  inflation  risks, and  I share  those concerns.  But I also  seeand hear what is going on in the  real economy in terms of productivity  increases  and pricecontainment.  As I weigh the two  sides,  I feel comfortable with the wait-and-see  approach  thatwe have  followed in recent months.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As was the case the last time we met, theeconomy  of our southeastern  region also looks very much  like the nation's,  after having led thenation for five plus years  earlier in the expansion.  Sixth District economic  growth appears tohave  moderated somewhat  during the second quarter,  primarily reflecting  some  softening inmanufacturing  and to  some extent in the  single-family real estate sector.  Our regional  survey of7/1-2/97manufacturing  indicates  that the proportion of firms reporting  increases  in production  andshipments  declined  significantly,  and there  was a sharp falloff in new orders.  Looking  ahead,however, expectations  were  for increased orders  and  backlogs.  Reported  plans  for capitalspending over the coming six months also declined.  Underscoring  the comments Ed Boehnejust made, I too am struck by the frequency with which corporate  CEOs continue to tell me thattheir investment  spending is  driven by the pursuit of gains  in productivity  and efficiency  toprotect their margins  rather than to increase capacity.  Regional  retail sales,  while on  averageslightly above year-ago  levels, seem to  have slowed  somewhat or at least to have paused.  At thesame time, we are told that inventories  are at desirable  levels, with only a few  retailers reportingsomewhat higher levels.  The tourism and hospitality industries,  which are particularly  importantto our region,  continue  their solid growth.  Near-term  bookings  in our major tourist cities arenow reported to be up between 5  and 20 percent.  For example, the huge Opryland complex  inNashville, which added 20 percent  capacity just recently,  stays essentially  full with spillover  toother hotels in Nashville.  Wage pressures  across  our regions  are mixed.  The tightest markets  arethose  with the  highest percentage  of high-tech employment  and  the hospitality industry, whichhas been tight for quite  a while now.  Stories  about the role of competition in holding down priceincreases  do not seem  to change very much from those we  have been talking about for more thana year, although  I recently had several CEOs  tell me that they  are beginning  to see  pressures  onhave seen recently.Our view  of the national  economy  is very  similar to that of the Greenbook this time.  Itis now quite  clear that the expansion slowed  significantly in the  second quarter.  We,  too, look7/1-2/97for the  pace to pick up again in the last half of the year, pushing  year-over-year  growth to about3-1/2 percent.  Like others, our best guess is that the slowing  is likely to turn out to be a pause  orcatch-your-breath  period rather than  a fundamental  slowdown.  The ingredients  for renewedvigor in  consumer spending  seem to be in place  and, absent  a significant correction  in assetprices,  we could  get a sizable  surprise  on the upside.What  concerns me most, consistent  with what others already have observed,  is that  ourown forecast  and most other forecasts  show a gradual upward drift in inflation  at the end  of 1997into  1998  and even into  1999.  If we are really committed to a forward-looking  preemptiveapproach  to policy and  if we are  satisfied that we have  corrected  for what has  been anoverestimation of inflation  in most of our forecasts in recent times,  then in my view we probablywill need to adjust policy further sometime  soon.  We will need  to do  so to hold our inflation  andcredibility gains before  we  get behind the curve,  as we have  so often in the past.  In my mind, therisks of being wrong  in our forecasts  and getting somewhat  slower-than-expected  growth andlower  inflation  seem quite  small.  Accordingly,  a forward-looking  preemptive  approach to policyis  quite consistent  with our longer-run objective  for controlling  inflation that I hope we willembrace  more firmly as we talk about these issues during the remainder of this meeting.Obviously,  a preemptive  approach  to policy to guard  against an expected upward drift ininflation, which  is present only in our forecasts  and cannot yet be  seen in our current data,increases  the burden on all  of us to provide  skillful  explanations  of our policy  actions.  Thankyou, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  The Ninth District economy  remainsremarkably  healthy overall  and  rather than go into details  about that now familiar  story, let mereport on a breakfast meeting that  we had last week with some 20  or 30 business  and communityleaders from the Twin Cities.  They were representative, I think, of the Twin  Cities economy,although  certainly not a perfect reflection of it.  Several  themes came  out of this breakfast.  Oneis that the degree of tightness in our labor market  cannot be overstated.  There  were widespreadreports  of great difficulty in finding workers,  and some of these firms,  of course,  are employingpeople District-wide  and in some cases nationwide.  I think it was  clear that this tightness  is nowbeing reflected  in wage and benefit increases, and that incentives like  signing bonuses, retentionbonuses,  early qualification  for participation  in 401(k) plans and so on  are becoming  increasinglycommonplace.  A second theme was the importance  of international  trade to  many of thesebusinesses.  There were generally favorable  comments  about such trade.  The protectionistsentiment  that rears  its head from time to time in the District  was not evident.  There  seemed tobe a general  appreciation  of what trade can do for an economy.  Certainly, most of these businessleaders  feel and believe that globalization  is  a big issue,  and it may be the single biggest factor  intheir minds  as to why it is difficult to raise  prices in the current environment.  That is a summaryof what came  out of that meeting.As far as the national  economy  is concerned,  my view  is generally positive in  thesense that I think real economic  growth will continue  at a satisfactory  pace.  My own numbersare not  very different  from those of the Greenbook, maybe a bit more optimistic  as far as realgrowth is concerned.  Where  I become  concerned  is that if we believe the Greenbook  forecast,then it seems to me that an acceleration  of inflation is increasingly likely at some point.  Our7/1-2/97forecasting  model, which  is a VAR model unencumbered  by judgment,  [laughter]  produces  thesame result.  In listening to  the  staff presentation  on the outlook in conjunction with theprospective  inflation situation, I found two things particularly discouraging.  As  I understood thepresentation,  were  it not for a projected decline  in the markup  of prices over unit labor costs, wewould get  a more discernible  increase  in inflation.  So, in part the staff is banking  on a factor thatto  me seems by no means to  be a  foregone conclusion.  The second  thing that I founddiscouraging  about the forecast is that  after some  analysis  and thought,  the  staff concluded  thatpotential  growth  on the supply side is no more rapid than they thought earlier.  This means  thatdespite the business community's  view that productivity  is rising rapidly, there  apparently is notmuch  evidence  that that is the case.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am  going to characterize  reports aroundthe  Fourth District as mixed.  All of the large  metropolitan  areas and most of the medium-sizemetropolitan  areas are  not mixed at all; their local  economies  are  operating  flat out.  But anumber of smaller communities  around the District and some counties  still report unemploymentrates of about 9 or  10 percent.  My impression  in driving through those  counties is that  suchunemployment rates might translate  into only 1 or  2 people,  [laughter]  but still--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If you mean  a 9 percent  unemployment  rate with alabor force of 2, that raises  a very interesting  mathematical  question!

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Construction  activity is reported to be booming throughout theDistrict in that  there are no unemployed construction  workers.  Resources  in that industry  are sotight that many people cannot get bids  on construction  contracts.  There was a recent effort to7/1-2/97secure bids for  the Cleveland Browns'  new football  stadium, and they came in  well over budget.It is now reported that the whole  project may cost $100  million more  than the  first estimatewhen  it was agreed to build the stadium.  Three years  ago, we negotiated  a guaranteed  maximumprice  on our building project.  I am now told that  we would no longer be able to get a guaranteedmaximum price.  So, I'm glad that we negotiated it when we  did, and  in fact the cost came inunder budget.  Under current circumstances,  the project  would be much more expensive.Retail  spending is  reported to be definitely  softer. who isassociated  with a national  retailing company but tries to assess what is happening at the stores inour region, indicates  that earnings  are coming under very severe pressure.  The main problemsthat he  sees  are in imported inventories.  Such imports account  for about 70  percent of theproblems with inventories insofar as the  latter relate to filling  orders and production  pipelines.Labor contract  settlements have been  coming in with increases  of around  3  to 4percent in most cases.  There clearly  has been  an uptick from previous  settlements,  so that theperiod of successive  contracts  coming in  somewhat lower than prior contracts  is definitely over.We had  one construction  union contract  that went to arbitration and came in at 4.8 percent.  Weall hear the  same talk about labor shortages in our Districts, and I  will not go further on that.  Wehave heard some talk about job fairs  about which  I am a bit puzzled  after listening to some  of thereports  around the table this afternoon.  Columbus  city officials went  to Boston to hold a job fairto recruit people and  Cincinnati officials  went to San Francisco.  I hope they had a good time[laughter]  because it is not likely that they hired many new workers.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  We are  told that there  is no  backlog  in orders of steel, basicallybecause new  domestic capacity is coming on at a time when imports continue  to be very strongand there  are downward  pressures  on prices.  One director feels  very  strongly that plant andequipment spending is  going to slow, mainly because he  says the motor vehicle companies  aregoing to be winding  down their spending on new capacity.  I think he is talking principally  aboutdomestic companies.  Communications  companies  in one of our metropolitan  areas  said thattheir  yellow-page listings  are running  at an  all-time record, especially  business listings, whichthey said are rising very  sharply.  Phone line installations are  proceeding  at rates above previousrecords.  Bankers  are telling us that earnings  are good but they are worried  about not being  ableto maintain these earnings.  Their margins  are getting  squeezed,  and the quality of their loanportfolios  is deteriorating.  Everybody  is talking about very aggressive  bidding for real  estatedeals  that they would not have  considered  not that long ago.  We hear more reports thatspeculative  residential and commercial projects  are getting  funded, mainly as banks try toachieve  their earnings  objectives  for the year.  Down in Kentucky, horse  farmland prices  arejumping.  [Laughter]  Next  year I will say they are  galloping!  We are told that land that wasrunning $3,500 to $3,800 per acre in  1996--these  are horse farms--was  recently  selling for$4,500 to $5,000.  So,  there has been  a significant  notch up.  Two of our directors  have  arguedthat inflation is understated.  They claim that  many discounts  that they had become  used to andregularly expected  are simply  no longer available.Let me shift to some thoughts  about the national  economic  environment  in which wefind ourselves.  Often  in the past when  we have talked  about recent  and prospective  near-termdevelopments,  we have  given attention to such things as inventories,  trade statistics, and  the like.7/1-2/97Usually we  try to look through the  statistics for the past couple of years  and the forecasts  for thenext couple  of years in an effort to discern  the basic trends  in productivity,  labor  force growth,labor force participation,  and those  kinds of things.  I want to focus on a much longer-termperspective  for a  few minutes.  The business  cycle  dating committee  at the National  Bureau  ofEconomic Research says  that this expansion  is now  past its seventh year.  Without thateight-month  contraction  associated  with the Gulf War, they would be saying that we have justfinished  15  years of expansion.  This period generally  has been characterized  by a risingparticipation  rate in the labor force,  a declining  unemployment  rate,  a concurrent downwardtrend of inflation, and even  a recent  improvement  in the saving rate.  There have  also beenincreasing returns to capital  relative to returns to labor  associated not only with increased capitalinflows but a domestic  investment spending boom.  Certainly, at least some of these good resultsare due to good  policies.  I think even our most severe  critics would give us some credit forhelping to make this economic  performance  come  about.  It was not all  luck, and it was not alltechnology and  innovation.Looking back, if the past  15  years  had been  characterized  by several  2- to 3-yearstop-and-go cycles  and/or if the inflation rate had averaged,  say, 5  or 6 percent through  thisperiod,  I think we would all agree that standards  of living would be lower today,  the capital  stockwould be smaller,  and overall  the economy  would not look and feel nearly as good as it does.  If5 years  from now we are talking about an  expansion  that is approximately 20 years old, it will bebecause  the basic  trends that have  characterized  the last  15 years  have been maintained.Instead  of asking how we can keep inflation from going up, we  could pose thequestion simply by asking how we might improve  the chances  that the expansion  will last7/1-2/97another 5 years.  Part of our answer probably would be that a necessary but certainly not asufficient  condition is to prevent the escalation  of inflation.  Some of the Fed watchers--andsome  of us, too--who  look back  on what we did in 1994 have  characterized  those actions  aspreemptive  anti-inflation  measures.  But it would be just as accurate  to say that they reflected  apreemptive  anti-recessionary  policy.  That is because  had we not done what we did,  I believe  wecould make a very good case that we would have had  a  1996-1997  recession.  If we had failed  toact in 1994  and  inflation had accelerated,  we would today be facing  a higher unemployment  ratethan we currently  have, a  lower level of output, less overall capacity,  and the economy would notfeel  as good.  So, we were preemptive  in the  sense of being  anti unemployment  and preservinggrowth.When  we turn to our future prospects,  if we state our objective as minimizing  the riskthat the year 2000 will turn  out to be  a recession  year, I think we would argue that it is necessarybut not sufficient to prevent more inflation  from  emerging in 1998  and  1999.  If we  aresuccessful  in doing that, employment is going  to be higher and  output and  standards of living aregoing to be higher when  we get to the year 2000.  This is going to be a richer country.  Thefrustration comes  when we look at policy options for the near term, for the next year or two.  Thelatter often involve raising the  unemployment rate to prevent inflation,  but the ultimate objectiveis preventing the emergence  of a recession  and  unemployment.  Sometimes  it must sound topeople out on Main  Street that we had to create unemployment  in order to preventunemployment.  I think we need to find ways to cast our policy  alternatives  and to communicateour objectives  in a manner that does not involve retarding  growth and raising unemployment,even for an  interim period.  There are ways  of thinking and  talking about the interim objective  of7/1-2/97stabilizing the purchasing power of money that do not involve  excess  supply of or demand  foroutput,  or excess supply of or demand for labor.  I think that would be a useful  thing for us to beworking  on as we  struggle our way to the year 2000.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I had somewhat the  same instinct to look back that Cathy Minehan had,but because  this is  my first anniversary  meeting,  so to speak, I looked back to my first  meeting ingrowing  at a rate well above trend, but the rate of expansion  was expected to slow to trend and,indeed, second-quarter  growth last year turned  out to be even stronger  than the Greenbookpredicted.  Consumption, investment,  and housing were  all described as  strong but expected  toslow.  Last year's Greenbook had a tone of some  surprise at the  strength especially ofconsumption  and  housing.  Labor  markets were described  as very tight, but demand for laborwas  expected to moderate.  The unemployment rate was  then 5.4 percent,  and it was expected tolevel out at around  5.5 percent.  Concern  was  expressed  about prospective  wage  increases,employment  cost increases,  a rise in the minimum wage and its impact on wages  more generally--the minimum wage legislation  had not passed yet, but  it was expected  to--and  aboutprospective  increases in the CPI.  But the actual CPI forecast  was shaded down  a little on thebasis  of then-recent  experience.  In addition, it was boldly stated that the stock market wasseriously overvalued.A year later, what have  we seen?  We have  seen  the GDP experience  some slowquarters  and some fast  ones, but on balance  it has been  stronger  than was forecast  a year ago.  Itis  still expected  to slow to trend but not quite as rapidly  as was thought last year.  Labor markets7/1-2/97are even tighter than anticipated  and actually are  expected  to get a little more  so, with theunemployment  rate leveling  out at about 4.5 percent instead of about 5.5 percent.  Concern  isstill being expressed  about the outlook for wage increases,  employment cost increases,  anotherround  of minimum wage  hikes,  and prospective  increases  in the CPI.  But the forecast of the CPIis  again being shaded down  a bit.  The stock market  is being described even  more emphaticallyand for good reasons  as seriously overvalued.  We now have a forecast  of a decline in stockprices, but not a very imminent one.What  have we learned over the past year?  I think we have  learned  to be cautious.  Thetone of the current  Greenbook is considerably  less  sure of itself than it was a year ago.  We  havelearned that the economy  is less inflation-prone than we thought.  After another year of lowinflation, we can be more confident that expected  inflation will  be low.  But the risks of inflationare  still there, and almost everybody  around the table is emphasizing  those risks.  I think it can besaid that the  cost of waiting has proved  to be less  than anticipated.  We  are all aware  of that, butthere is also  a view that we may be  about to run out of time.  We have  learned that tight laborexamples  of that around the table even at this meeting.We have  not made  a lot of progress  toward solving the fundamental  puzzles.  Thequestion  of why wages  and benefits  are not rising faster is  still there,  and the job insecurityhypothesis  propounded by the Chairman  a year or so ago seems  perhaps a little less plausibleafter a year of more  plentiful jobs.  The puzzle of why prices are  not rising more, given  the laborcost increases,  is still  there.  One of the strongest  contributions clearly has been  the downwardpressure  of import prices  stemming  from the strong dollar, but that effect seems to be coming to7/1-2/97an end.  We  do not have a very  good analytical  explanation for the anecdotes  we keep hearing.Those include the perceived inability  of firms to make price increases  stick, even  in thoroughlydomestic markets  and quite local markets.  That puzzle  is still mystifyingly  there.  Productivityremains  a puzzle.  The circumstantial  evidence  still points to an acceleration  in productivitygrowth, possibly  associated  mainly with the large  investments in computers and associatedchanges  in production  processes,  with other types  of capacity increases,  with the tight laborand the usual statistics are not helping us at all.  I think we come down to a contest between  theoptimists  and  the pessimists.  I tend to be one  of the optimists.  I think we  still have to be veryvigilant about inflation, but I would be inclined  like Ed Boehne to be a little more  on the side ofwait-and-see.  I do not think we have  made a lot of progress on the  analysis  that will tell us morethan  we get from being optimists or pessimists.

MR. MCTEER.  Over the last couple of months,  growth of the Texas economy  hasbegun  to pick up steam.  In the Eleventh District as  a whole,  employment growth is once  againoutstripping that of the nation after both had converged  for a period of about a year and a half.In addition,  it is becoming increasingly  difficult to find any pockets of weakness to report  about.If anything will put a damper on future growth, it is likely to be the continued tightening  of laborI, too, had  breakfast last week.  [Laughter]  I had breakfast  with the senior executivesof three Dallas-based high-tech  firms.  It  was not long before the discussion  turned  from overallbusiness conditions  to labor market  turnover and the methods  they were  using to deal with the7/1-2/97loss of key employees  and the shortage  of replacements.  There was talk of retention bonuses tomatch or top the signing bonuses  offered by competitors,  of drastically  increased  incentivebonuses,  indeed, anything  to meet the market  even to the point of scrapping  completely  thecompensation  and reward  systems  that had been in place  for many years.  My first reaction  wasto think that somehow  this new  attitude that  "the  sky is the  limit" on pay  scales would have to beinflationary  if it persisted.  But within  a few  minutes  the conversation  turned  to the reengineeringefforts  that these companies  were engaged  in.  These efforts  were driven by a need to continuedropping  their final product prices by  10 to 20 percent per year.  If competitive  forces  arebringing about  10 to 20 percent deflation  in product prices,  I have  about decided that  I am not asworried  as I was that rising wages  could be causing inflation.The energy industry and  all the industries that service  it are running at full capacity inour District.  Oil  drilling remains profitable even  with the  lower prices that have prevailed inrecent  months.  Thanks to improved technologies,  drilling is profitable  for some companies  withprices as low  as $15  per barrel;  with prices above  $19,  everybody  I meet in the energy businessseems  to have a smile on his face.  The Dallas  Fed has just lost one of its head  office directors,who runs an energy  services  machine  shop, because  he is simply  too busy to attend  the boardmeetings.Construction  activity continues to strengthen and a few  of my contacts  in that industryare  starting to talk about  the beginnings  of a possible boom in commercial  construction.  Hardlya day  goes by without an announcement  of a new office or other commercial  project.  Dallasnationwide,  but it now has a suburban vacancy rate  below the national  average.  With the supply7/1-2/97of such  space fixed  over the short run, rents  have risen sharply to reflect the growth in demand.It is likely that the rise  in new  construction activity  will put a cap on rent increases,  and  later theadded capacity will  likely reverse the inflationary  impact  of the recent rent increases.  About ayear ago, I mentioned  that our commercial  real estate market had turned  from a tenant's marketinto  a landlord's  market.  One of our Beigebook  contacts just reported that  "it's a scary time tobe a tenant right now."  In  fact, one of our head office  directors  may be forced  to move his officeheadquarters  to suburban  Houston unless he is willing to double his rent payments when  hislease expires  shortly.The Mexican  economy continues to improve,  with positive spillovers for Texas.  Weget reports that more Mexicans  are making trips north for shopping.  Lately, they have beenshowing up at higher-end  apparel  retailers  and even  at car dealerships.  Mexico's improvedeconomy has led to renewed  growth of Texas exports to Mexico.  The recent boom in Mexicanexport-focused  maquiladora  manufacturing  has  attracted  several high-tech electronics  andcomputer manufacturers  to the El Paso/Juarez  area, thereby generating  a new  label,  "ChiliconValley," for the region.  [Laughter]This weekend's  election in Mexico  is generating more  than the usual amount ofuncertainty because the ruling party could possibly  lose control  of the legislature.  The generalfeeling  seems to be that the outcome  of the election  will have  little economic  impact.  This viewbusinesses in Texas,  concerns  about the election outcome  are one of the few worries in our area.As for the national  economy, I don't have any information or new  insights that you donot have or have not heard before.  I guess the main difference  is in my interpretation  of that7/1-2/97information  and, perhaps,  Ed Boehne's.  When  I read over the transcript  of our May meeting,  Iwas  struck by the dovish  tone of my remarks,  which  makes me uncomfortable,  being the hawkthat you all know me  to be.  I realize that only hawks  get to go to central banker  heaven,  and Iwant to go there to be  with all my friends  around this  table!  [Laughter]  So, let me assure  youthat I have not lost my inflation-fighting  zeal.  It's just that I believe we are  already winning  thatwar, and for some reason  we are  having trouble accepting  our success.  Maybe we  feel that wedo not deserve the gain because  we have  not suffered the pain.  Something  is different  in thiseconomy.  It  may not last, but it already has lasted  much longer  than we expected.  At  the lastmeeting,  we had four straight months  of declining PPI;  now it is five.  At the  last meeting, wehad two months of .1 increases  in the CPI; now  it is three.  The  two price measures  haveincreased significantly  less or have declined  so far this year, as have  other broad  measures ofinflation.  Neither is there a buildup of inflation  in the pipeline--commodity  prices, oil, gold,steers,  wheat,  whatever.  The yield curve  is lower and flatter, the dollar remains  strong, and thebond  vigilantes have eased long-term rates  recently.  Sooner or later, the tight labor markets  willprobably  spill over into higher prices,  but that prospect  seemed imminent a  year or more  ago.In summary, the economy looks too good  to be true.  I know  how these  stories usuallyend when people  say something is too good  to be true,  but perhaps  they don't always end asexpected.  Yes,  Cathy, we are  a learning organization but with a long  and variable  lag.[Laughter]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer, top that if you can!

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  That is a tough  act to follow.  I read the recent data as consistent with aslowing  in second-quarter  growth to near 2 percent.  I view this in large  measure as  a payback7/1-2/97for the surprisingly robust first-quarter  growth.  More  importantly,  the fundamentals  supportingaggregate  demand,  in my judgment,  remain very positive:  there is  solid momentum in incomeand employment;  financial  conditions are  generally  favorable,  and  measures of consumerconfidence  have soared to new highs.  In the  absence  of a change in policy, the fundamentalsappear  to support the Greenbook  projection of a rebound to  well-above-trend  growth in thesecond  half and continued  growth near trend over  1998.  As a result, the unemployment rate islikely to trend  lower in  coming quarters  from an  already low  level.  While this would normallysuggest  an increased  risk  of higher inflation,  the staff trimmed its inflation forecast  in thisGreenbook.  This highlights what we  have come  to appreciate as  a very unusual  period from theperspective  of the relationship between  inflation  and unemployment.  The staff forecastrepresents  a careful  attempt to balance the  inflation risk  stemming from prevailing and projectedlabor utilization rates with a continuing exceptional  performance  of inflation.  My first reading  ofthe Greenbook,  however, was that the  staff had somehow mistakenly combined  an output pathfrom  a buoyant economy run  and the low inflation path from  an alternative  soft economy run.True,  there remains  some upward drift in inflation in the  staff forecast,  but most of theacceleration  over  1998  reflects  the small rise  in oil prices  following  the sharp  decline this yearand a rebound in non-oil  import prices after a further  fall in the  first half of this year.Compensation  per hour, on the other hand, edges up only .1 next year despite an unemploymentrate  that is nearly  one percentage  point below  the staff's assumption of the NAIRU.Let me focus on two  positive elements  in the inflation forecast  that support theGreenbook  story and two concerns that nevertheless  make me very worried  that prices  may risemore than the Greenbook projects.  The first positive factor is the influence  of an excellent7/1-2/97inflation performance  this year on wage determination  and  on inflation next year.  Overall,inflation this year is benefiting from falling energy prices,  smaller increases  in food prices, andto date still declining import prices.  Next year, wage change  and core inflation will feel  thebenefits.That still leaves  unanswered  the question  of what is holding down wages and coreinflation  this year despite the low unemployment rate.  In my never-ending  effort to reconcilelow inflation  and low unemployment,  I have been placing  increased weight  on the contrastbetween the  apparent tightness  in the labor market and the seeming absence of comparabletightness  in the  product market.  This is  illustrated by the fact that while the prevailing 4.8percent unemployment  rate  is below most estimates  of NAIRU,  the prevailing  capacityutilization  rate is only  a shade above its estimated natural  rate.  Looking at the historical  recordof unemployment and  capacity utilization  rates in previous cycles, one reaches  the conclusionthat this disparity is  a unique feature  of the current episode.One  way of appreciating  the significance  of this disparity is to view the unemploymentrate in a price/price  specification  of the Phillips curve as  a proxy for  overall excess  demandacross  both labor and product markets.  Given  that the  excess demand  in the  labor market istraditionally mirrored  by a similar degree  of excess demand in the product  market, theunemployment  rate is generally  a reasonably  good proxy for economy-wide  excess demand.  Inthe current case, however,  the unemployment  rate at best is capturing  tightness in the laborto compare  inflation forecasts  from the Phillips curve  using the unemployment rate tospecifications using capacity  utilization rates.  This disparity  most likely reflects  one  of the key7/1-2/97and perhaps under-appreciated  features  of the current expansion--the  robust pace  of businessfixed investment,  notably equipment purchases  and particularly  purchases  of high-technologyequipment.  The result is  that industrial  capacity is  increasing  at the fastest rate in 28 years.  Thenet effect is that while labor markets  are tight, the  increasing  productive capacity  associated  withthe investment boom has prevented  excess  demand from  arising in the product markets.  Themuch reported  absence of pricing leverage  that firms emphasize may be another  implication ofthe absence  of excess demand  in the product markets.  Nothing gives a firm market power likeexcess demand.  I  also suspect that firms  have responded  to the absence  of pricing leverage  bybeing less willing to bid aggressively for workers,  thereby helping to explain  why wage changehas increased  so modestly despite  the prevailing  tightness  in labor markets.  The aboveconsiderations  do encourage  me to expect  continued modest  inflation  over the forecast  horizon.Let me conclude,  however,  with two reasons  why I remain  concerned  that inflationaveraged 5.4  percent in  1996, close to most current estimates  of NAIRU.  It has fallensignificantly  below  this threshold for only a couple of months.  The rise in wage change  wewould normally  anticipate  from the prevailing unemployment  gap may therefore  be just ahead.As  I emphasized  above,  the role of the capacity utilization rate is in  my view  only to damp ratherthan to block entirely the  effect of the lower unemployment rate.  Hence,  both time and stilllower unemployment  rates pose  a real threat  of higher  inflation.  Second,  a coincidence  oftemporary factors,  including declining  import prices associated  with the appreciation  of thedollar, a slowdown  in the  rise in benefit  costs, and most recently a  decline in energy prices have7/1-2/97been contributing  to restraint  in the  increases in  compensation  and consumer prices.  Thesefactors  are likely  to be of diminishing importance  going forward.On balance,  in the absence  of further policy  changes  I expect above-trend  growth overcoming  quarters,  a further  decline  in the unemployment  rate, and  still modest  inflation.  Perhapsthe main message  here  should be that this  would be  a remarkably  benign outcome.  But we getpaid to worry and we get paid to hold the line on inflation.  I am concerned  that the increase  ininflation  may be somewhat sharper  than projected  in the Greenbook,  and I believe that the singlemost important risk factor in the forecast  is the potential for a significantly  sharper rise  ininflation.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A  lot of the suspicions  that we discussedlast time  seem  to be a bit more confirmed.  We have had some slowdown in  consumption,  atleast for March through  May.  Inflation  appears  to have remained well  behaved.  It seems to methat the questions  now before us cluster into two  areas.  The first is whether  we really  areexperiencing  a slowdown  in the expansion.  If so, how  much?  Is this  soft landing  more of atouchdown to be  followed by a takeoff in the next few  months?  The second area of questionsclusters  around inflation.  How  is it possible  that the inflation record has been so favorable?How much longer can we  reap the benefits  of this benign inflationary environment?  I havestructured  my comments  around  these two sets of questions.First,  with respect to the factors contributing to the length and perhaps  to theupcoming strengthening  of this expansion,  there  is certainly the behavior  of the labor market,  ashas already been  discussed  around the table  today.  People appear to be  coming  out of the7/1-2/97woodwork  to join the labor force.  The consistent  and now  widespread  reports of labor shortages,hiring bonuses,  and retention bonuses are  impressive.  During the  intermeeting period,  I madeseveral trips to the  Midwest  and the West, and I met with  several groups here  at the Board.  Ihave been particularly impressed  by the labor shortage  stories.  I never thought that  I would behearing in-migration  suggested  and  accepted  as the answer to Iowa's economic  challenges.[Laughter]  Business people are now talking  about and recognizing  that they not only have tolocate and transport new  workers,  but they also  have to train unskilled workers  to meet theirproduction  needs.  Clearly, this indicates  that the labor market is going to be strong  for a  while.  Iam not  sure that I can  quite buy into the Greenbook  forecast  of a 4.6  percent unemployment  ratethrough  1998,  but even  if the rate drifts  up a bit, it is clear that the  U.S. job machine is alive  andwell.  Strong labor markets mean  that people  have  the  wherewithal to spend,  and we certainly  areseeing the evidence  of that in the aggregate numbers  for retail sales  and housing.The second  area that  has been contributing  to the strength  of this expansion is  businessfixed investment.  I think the fundamentals  remain  for growth in that  area.  The overall  cost ofcapital  is low for short-term  and long-term  debt financing and  for both internal and externalequity financing.  There is  no capital  shortage and  certainly  no credit crunch.  Profit levels  havebeen holding  up, and that puts management  in the  mood to expand or at least to buy moreequipment to improve productivity.  The low inflation environment,  I believe, is  especiallyconducive  to capital  investment.  In fact, declining  prices  for computers and  informationtechnology make these  investments  particularly viable in the presence of tight labor  markets.The gains in the productivity  of capital seem  to be encouraging additional  investment.  Thetechnology  story has been well  documented,  and I think firms  are learning  to manage  inventories7/1-2/97more closely.  These  two factors  seem  to feed  on each other:  business  investment creates jobopportunities,  and a strong labor market allows  continued growth  in consumption andaggregate  demand.  I guess we have  located  or we are  at least getting  close to a zone ofsustainability.The second set of questions  that I identified relates  to inflation.  Why is it that we  havehad such a favorable  inflationary  performance  recently?  That performance  probably can beattributed  to a number of factors.  The strong  dollar accompanied  by low-inflation  imports hashelped to control  domestic inflation.  Increased  business fixed  investment has added  to capacityand improved productivity.  The  macroeconomic  weakness  of the  economies of some of ourforeign  trade partners  has alleviated commodity price pressures.  There have been  no recentenergy or food shocks,  and the  farm outlook for 1997  is quite  favorable also.  Now,  lest we gettoo cocky, we should remember  that the  BLS has made some  improvements  to CPImeasurement,  shaving  several  tenths from the index.  President  Moskow  drew our  attention tothis.  While this is quite a rosy outlook,  I do see considerable  risks:  The economy  could turn  outto be stronger than we anticipate.  Consumers  could reemerge  and  go on a spending  spree.  Asthe international  sector strengthens,  we should expect  it to be  less of a drag on  GDP growth, butconcomitantly  that may bring back  some inflationary  pressures.  With respect  to inflation,  atsome  point wage pressures  will  start to  bite.  Productivity improvements  can  only absorb  somuch.  I believe  a key area for us to watch is profit margins.  If we were  to see significant  profitThe possibility of such a development  was certainly  highlighted in the  Greenbook.7/1-2/97In  sum, while we have  seen a bit of a  slowdown in the expansion, it may already havecome and gone or it may be on the way  out.  It  does  seem to  me a bit too soon to tell, but the riskis that growth may be more than has been  anticipated.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, economic  growth in the  SecondDistrict has slowed slightly over the past six weeks,  and the growth that is taking place  is mainlyin New  York City.  Economic activity is rather  stagnant  in the rest of New  York State,  andgrowth  has slowed slightly in the northern part of New Jersey.We do not have great differences  with the  forecasts  of the other members  so let metalk a little about where  I think we  are.  Because monetary policy works  with long and variablelags, as  we all know, we  must consider what  will happen  18  to 36 months from now, not what ishappening today.  That puts us in  the forecasting  business.  All of us believe in price stability,even  though we  have not agreed around the table  on precisely  what that means  beyond yourworking  definition  of it, Mr. Chairman.  I  find increasingly that the  degree of anxiety  ofCommittee  members  varies with their belief in traditional  forecasting  methods.  All areforecasting  some increase  in core  inflation later this  year and in  1998,  but all have beenforecasting  higher inflation  for the last two years  and it has not happened.Those of us who are perhaps  least uncomfortable  with watching and waiting  are thosewho,  in my words, concentrate  on knowing  what  we do not know.  We know  that for the last twoyears or so the  forecasting models have  not been working well,  witness how bad our forecastshave  been.  What we  do not know is why they have not been working.  My feel, as was discussedat length at the last meeting, is that we have  been underestimating  and  we continue to7/1-2/97underestimate  productivity, but we  aren't sure  of that.  In fact, in meeting  after meeting with theexception  of March,  the Committee has been  fretting  but waiting.  I think that many of us havefelt that the risk of waiting  has been quite  low because,  as measured  by the  real fed  funds rateand in other ways,  our policy is in fact  rather tight;  it certainly  is not loose.  Therefore,  I believethat we can afford  and should  continue to wait until we  have greater  certainty about what reallyis happening in the economy.  Some members  of the Committee  are very concerned  about ourcredibility  if we wait, and certainly they should be concerned  if we  wait too long.  But I thinkcredibility is not the result of raising rates  whether needed or not; credibility  is doing the rightthing.  In my view,  we have been doing the right thing.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  By my count,  I am the  cleanup hitter herein this  excellent  tour de table.  Nearly  every thing has been said, and I will be very brief.  It doesseem that  we finally  are getting  a slowdown in  the expansion, albeit a quarter later than expected.The inflation news  continues  to be very good,  with none  of the indices  surging, a few beginningto show  signs of drifting upward,  and most still either flat or drifting down  on a  12-month  changebasis.  I continue  to try as best I can to scan carefully  for emerging  pressures  in the inflationarypipeline.  I've seen  very little pressure  for a number  of quarters,  but recently there have  beenstraws in the wind that  some new  pressures may be starting  to emerge  such as the expectedincrease in the level of import prices  and so forth.  The glaring exception,  of course, is ourremarkable  labor market; everybody  has talked about that.  So far, price  levels have been verylittle affected by the low unemployment  rate  and the rising ECI, as  our unit labor costs ofproduction  have remained  very  stable.  However, the  Greenbook  is now projecting  a substantial7/1-2/97and sustained acceleration  in unit labor costs beginning  almost  immediately, and  time will tellabout that.  While the condition  of the economy  today remains excellent,  tensions  and  pressurescontinue  to build as one looks  forward over  our forecast horizon.  If the  rate of expansionremains  moderate,  this  remarkable  era could continue  well into the future.  However, if growthshould reaccelerate  strongly in  the short run, the Committee  may need to reassess  conditionsquickly  and critically.  Looking  further out in  our forecast  period,  I would like to be moreconfident than I am of the Greenbook's  projection  of substantially  slower growth through  1998.It  seems  quite likely to  me that growth  will exceed  the  Greenbook  projection over the forecastperiod, especially  if there  were to be no additional  monetary restraint until the middle of nextyear.  For now, however,  it is steady as  she goes.  She is going  very well  so far.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  As you pointed out, we have come to the endof this very interesting discussion.  We now move to something  quite different but also somethingthat is  likely to be quite interesting.  I call  on Dave Stockton  to lead us through  this set of issues.

MR.  JORDAN.  I  don't  know  if I  can  convert  this  into  a  question,  but  I  will  make  acomment  that ends with a question mark.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I will rephrase:  Questions  or comments?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  It was  an interesting paper  and it led to provocative  and3/ Secretary's  note:  In Mr. Stockton's  statement and the discussion  that followed, referencewas made to a staff memorandum  to the  Committee  dated June  19,  1997, and titled"Toward  a Working Definition  of Price Stability."  A copy of the memorandum  has beenplaced in  Committee  files.7/1-2/97useful discussions  with my  staff.  I was  glad to see not  only the paper but  to have  the topicincluded on the agenda.  When I approach  the  subject of various  price  statistics  as  potentiallyuseful information  for policy, I cannot  help but think back to the time when I was  a Boy Scoutand had to  learn the difference  between  magnetic north  and true north.  How  much adjustmentyou make depends  on where  you are on the globe.  The adjustment  is important because no onewants  to  go to magnetic  north.  Likewise,  we use  these statistical  series to guide us  toward someplace where  we want to go, but it is  also important  that we not lose  sight of where that place is.The paper starts by approaching  the issue  of how we measure  inflation.  I start adifferent way.  I start by  asking how I should define  the  condition of noninflation because  pricesare  changing all the time to some degree.  Noninflation  to me is a condition  in which theweighted average  of those prices that are  rising is just matched by the weighted  average of thoseprices  that are  falling.  This immediately  gets to the  question, prices  of what?  How do we wantto use the  concept  of inflation  in  talking about what  we are trying  to prevent  or minimize?  In agold standard  world that was  fairly easy because people in such a world  were conditioned  to thenotion that inflation  meant  it took more gold  dust or nuggets  to buy the same  thing.Unfortunately, we in  the modem  world  have gotten into the  habit of talking  about inflation interms of rising prices  of things  instead  of an increase in the number of money units it takes  tobuy those things,  which  is really what  inflation  is and  what we want to measure.Regarding  what to measure, we  are condemned  to  live in a world now and  forever inwhich we can only distribute  and consume what  we produce.  Brezhnev  thought  that such aworld was the result of a capitalist plot;  he never discovered  markets.  Our inflation measure  hasto relate  to output over time,  which does not  mean we should ignore  asset prices.  Ultimately,  it7/1-2/97has  to be a weighted  average  of the prices  of things that people  buy  and consume  over time.Some  of those prices always  seem to go up; tickets  to Cleveland  Indian  baseball  games certainlydo.  Some prices  go down; computer prices  certainly  do.  We are trying to find some way tonormalize  all of that information about  prices in  the minds  of people  and get them thinking that,yes,  some prices  are always  going up, some are always going down.  We want  them to see pricechanges as averaging  out.  That is what I mean by noninflation.I think our price  index has to be the broadest possible  measure of output prices, but wealso have to have information  about  asset prices.  That does  not mean that we necessarily want toinclude asset prices  in our statistical measure.  With regard to the  relevant theory,  Alchian  andKessel developed  a theoretical  framework  about 30 years  ago, and Alchian  and Klein did furtherwork in the early  1970s.  The St. Louis Fed staff tried to put some empirical  bones on  that in themid-1970s,  using various  statistical measures that  introduced  asset prices into the  Alchian andKlein framework.  About two years  ago at a Bank of Japan Conference,  Charles Goodhart  wentthrough  all that theory again  and he tried to develop  an empirical  measure  for England usingcertain asset prices.  So, there has been some work that  one could build on.  At this point,however, my judgment  is that we would add more noise than we know how to process if weincluded asset prices  in our measure  than if we did not.  We are better off seeking  as broad  ameasure  as we can of those things that are  simply current consumables  over time.  Question

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Mr. Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I don't have  any questions  either, just some comments.  I, too, thinkthis is a very good study, and it clearly  is based  on  some first-rate  empirical  work.  I like the use7/1-2/97of the model-based  simulations  to illustrate  the tradeoffs  facing  policy.  At least to me, thesesimulations  suggest that a flexible  approach to  pursuing price  stability would not generateexcessive  variability in output.  But more importantly,  I believe  that this  study contains  otheruseful insights  as well.  For one thing, it gives  us a working definition  of price  stability.Measured  in terms  of the  broad indices at  least, a value of around  1 percent  seems reasonable.Since inflation  as measured  by the broad indices  is still rising at a rate of 2 to 2-1/2 percent,  weclearly are not  at price  stability, and this,  of course,  is a fact that is brought  out in the Bluebookas well.  Moreover, the study  shows that it does  not seem to matter which  index  we choose.Focusing on one  broad price index  rather  than  another is unlikely to make  a significantdifference  in the longer-term  success  of our policies, and  I think the focus on the  longer term  isappropriate.  Finally and perhaps  most importantly,  I would like  the Committee  to focus moreclearly on the  pursuit of price stability,  which will  require  that we address  some  of the otherissues raised  in this  study  and also the list of issues  that were  in Dave  Stockton's cover memo.Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I would like to raise a more fundamental  question aboutthis whole  issue.  It is not  something that we  need to address  in the  shorter term, but it does  comeup when we look beyond  a 5-,  8-,  or  10-year  horizon.  If we start to focus on price  stability now,we should try to  be aware  of the problems that we may  be confronting  over the  longer term.First, let me raise  a  heretical issue.  Is price  stability really  what we are  after  or are weafter financial stability?  Even more  generally,  going back over  time we have  tended  to argue,  Ithink correctly,  that the objective  of monetary policy is  to create maximum sustainable  economicgrowth,  and we have  argued,  again I think quite correctly,  that price stability is  a necessary7/1-2/97condition  to reach that goal.  But price stability may indeed be  a proxy for  something else, whichI suspect is  financial  stability.If we look at the  data with which we  are  working, part of our problem as we  havediscussed before around this table relates  to the fact that an increasing  proportion of nominalGDP involves  items whose prices, as  we  define  and estimate them,  have been  undergoing  verysignificant declines  ranging up to  15,  20, or even  30 percent per year.  I will  argue  tomorrow  thatindustries  accounting for  3 percent of the nominal  GDP created  about a  third of the increase  inthe real  GDP over the past year.  It does  not require much  analytical  insight to see that if thesesegments of the economy  are increasing  their nominal  share  of GDP and if they continue  to doso, then at  some point we will be  looking  at an  average  price  level that  is falling and  could befalling quite significantly.  I would argue  that that is not deflation  in any meaningful  sense of theword.  Indeed,  the question really  is whether  that is something we wish to fight.  The reason isthat  if we define  price stability  in terms  of whatever  price measure we are  using and if we runinto an increasing  proportion  of high-tech products with  falling prices, we would be  led by ourprice stability objective  to inflate  the economy because  prices  are falling.  That clearly cannotmake any sense.One of the difficulties  created by all of this is that  it involves  very tough conceptualand measurement  problems  for us.  It is by no means  clear exactly how we should  measure pricestability,  given the prospect that it will  become  increasingly  difficult over time to define  whatconstitutes  output and prices.  I raised the issue  at an  earlier meeting and  suggested that it reallydidn't matter all that much from a policy standpoint  because it may well be that what we  areendeavoring to do is to stabilize the inflation premium in long-term interest  rates.  In short, as7/1-2/97Jerry Jordan  said, the  question is whether we are  looking at the  inflation  of prices  or the  declinein the purchasing power of money.  In this context,  even  if we  get to the point where  we  are notable  to define  very explicitly  the unit of production or bundle of goods  or services  involved  inparticular nominal  dollar sales  and hence  are unable to define  exactly what constitutes  price,there is no question  that we will still  have a nominal  interest rate  out there.  An  inflationpremium  is of necessity implicit  in the nominal  interest rate.  We may not be able  to define  aparticular price, but in the end we know that markets  are operating  on the basis  of some notion  ofprices.  When  we move  into the 21st century,  what we will try to  stabilize  may in effect be  thepurchasing power  of money,  however that  is measured.The reason  I raise these questions  is not that  we have to worry much  about them in thecurrent  period, as  I noted.  All  I wish to put on the table is the notion that, as  we respond  to theexcellent  paper by Dave Stockton  and his colleagues,  we bear in mind that it is  a paper that reallyrefers to  the nearer term.  The problems that we will be  dealing with as we  get beyond the turn  ofthe  century are  going to be increasingly  difficult to resolve  and in  fact to define.  There  is noconceptual  problem involved in defining  nominal  GDP, and we can in principle calculate  it downto the last dollar or even the last cent if we know how to measure  it correctly.  It isunambiguously  defined.  The unit  of production is not;  price is not.  So,  I think the problems thatwe  will have to  deal with in defining what we are stabilizing are  going to  increase  in the yearsahead.  What I want to  suggest is  that we confront the  question  of whether we are  trying tostabilize  prices  or trying to stabilize the financial  system.  That is  where the issue of asset pricescomes  in;  it is in a certain sense positioned  on a continuum  that begins with  spot prices  for unitsof goods  and services.7/1-2/97In sum,  I am speculating that we are going to  have problems  that are  quite  differentfrom those that we  have  today.  While  I am not saying that these involve  issues that  we need toresolve  today, I suspect that we will start to confront  them in  5  years or certainly within  10 years,and they may very  well affect our projections  going out to,  say, the  year 2006.  I also suspect thatby around  the year 2006, this very tricky question  may involve  what we are  endeavoring tostabilize  and may be the  focus of our policy actions.  My own guess  is that we are going  to bedealing with asset prices,  the  question of nominal  long-term  interest rates,  and probably  theoutlook for nominal GDP as  well.  In any event, our task will  surely be tougher than  it is today,and the issue will be how  we should proceed.  For the moment, fortunately,  that  is not an issue.All this probably is violating  President McTeer's  view that we  should just  sit and  enjoy it, but Idid want to mention that I have a different  set of worries.  Tomorrow, I will raise  theconventional  worries.

[SECTION]

MR.  MEYER.  In  the theoretical framework,  I think we should understand  that it isone thing to measure  and define price  stability;  it may be something  else again to define  aninflation  target.  I want to put on the  table the view that, before  we decide that we  want the targetto be price  stability  or what I might call price  stability plus a small  cushion,  we still need  to do alot of research  dealing with nominal  rigidities,  the potential flexibility of real  interest rates, andwhether a little deflation is more dangerous  than a little inflation.  I just want to throw that out.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  I already  mentioned to Dave  Stockton that I thought thismemo was extremely  well done.  I think it advances  our knowledge  and understanding  of thestrengths and  weaknesses  of the  various  indices.  It helps  to focus  our attention  on some  of the7/1-2/97questions  we  should be looking at, including  some that you raised,  Mr. Chairman.  I also thoughtthe memo made a good point in suggesting  that perhaps  we should be  thinking about pricestability  as opposed to arguing  and thinking about various inflation  indexes.One  of the things I wanted  to mention  is my hope that  some of the  conclusions in thememo and  some of our discussion  here will find their way into the  Humphrey-Hawkins  report.  Isay that because I think we need  to give some thought  to conditioning  people to recognize  thatwe are thinking  about a broad range  of issues and trends  as opposed to concentrating  on just oneinterest rate.  It is my impression that we are seen  as focusing  only on the fed funds  rate when infact we  are looking  at some longer-term issues  and what monetary policy can contribute tosustainable  economic  growth.  In my view,  some  airing of the issues that we are  looking atwould be a useful thing to include  in the Humphrey-Hawkins  report.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let  me just raise one  caveat to that.  If we  wereinvolved in  an objective  and wholly  academic  discussion,  I would agree  with  thatwholeheartedly.  I am  fearful  that there are people  out there who  are looking for any reason topresume  that a sound-money,  hawkish  view  a la McTeer  is the  wrong view.  That is regrettableat this stage, but we still have  a very large bias among various  members of the public  towardinflation.  I would be uncomfortable  about  opening up  discussions in  a way that might not beinterpreted  as  an appropriately balanced  view.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I understand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I would be very concerned  that it would be misread  asmeaning that we have abandoned  our objectives  of a stable currency  and  stable inflationarypressures.  Nonetheless,  it is  an issue that  is going to emerge,  and I do think we have to confront7/1-2/97a lot of broadened  policy issues in  Humphrey-  Hawkins  testimony.  I am a little  nervous  aboutthe way  the political system is operating.  I  do not want to  say that our monetary  policy has beenexceptionally good,  although  I think it has  in fact been  quite  good.  That  certainly has notstopped criticism in any material way,  and frankly I  find that worrisome.  I  don't know  wherethat  leaves us particularly,  but caution is probably  wise.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  I am  thinking  in terms  of some  of the conclusions  of the paper,including how some of the  price indices  may move  together and what their biases may  be.  Ibelieve  publishing some  of that  would be  very useful.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It  depends  on where  it gets us.  If at the  end of the daywe raise  more questions than we can answer, I'm not sure  that would be helpful  to us.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Maybe  not, but if we are never perceived  as  asking the questions, Ithink we will not be seen  as a very--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  is a  valid point;  I agree  with that.  I think thatbolstering the broad range  of information that  is already  in the Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony isa good idea.  But the  presumption  that we are just dropping  ideas into an  academic environmentfor general  discussion is not my notion  of what we should be doing.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I, too,  want to thank the staff for a good job  ofanalyzing  these  issues, and  I also appreciate  having  this matter on  the agenda.  These  are topicsthat we need  to  be talking  about.  I see this with a  shorter-term focus  than you were  talkingabout, but I feel that we could benefit  at the appropriate  time by being more clear amongourselves  and  eventually with  the public about our objectives  and by being  more transparent7/1-2/97regarding  what we  specifically  are trying to accomplish.  So,  I think we need to  be looking at andtalking  about this sort of thing.From that perspective,  some of the  things I took away from this analysis  included, firstof all,  the desirability  of focusing  on a broad measure of inflation.  That certainly  raises questionsin  my mind about the focus that we  as  an institution have  placed on core  CPI.  Even now,  someof the analysis  and  some of the simulations in  the Greenbook focus on core CPI and core PCE,and I wonder whether these measures  are  what we  ought to be  looking at in these  longer-termsimulations.  We probably  have created  an impression with the public  and the  financial  marketsthat core CPI is what  we really care  about.  I don't think we need  to change that impression  inthe near term, but I believe  there's  a good bit of feeling  out there that core CPI is our focus; atleast  that is my sense.I thought the insight with respect  to rates versus levels  was very  interesting.  Clearly,if we were  going to go in  this direction, then rather than debating  what the ideal index would beand setting its level,  it would simplify  things greatly to recognize  that the indices move broadlytogether  over time and to focus  on rates,  realizing that we are  a good distance  away from pricestability.  That might be  a good  first step.  I was also interested  in the sensitivity analysis  withrespect to fluctuations  of plus or minus  1 percentage  point from a fixed target.  In general,  I feelthat if we go in this direction, we  have to  be looking at the  trend in inflation  rather than a pointestimate.  Probably the  way to capture that idea is to  think in  terms of some range  around aparticular rate.  I thought  it was interesting that the plus or minus  1 percentage point that mostpeople would think about in terms of a reasonable  range does not generate  larger variations  onthe real  side in these  simulations than those we have  experienced.  In my view,  one of the7/1-2/97assumptions that one would have  to question  is the  tradeoff between  the inflation rate  and theoutput gap.  In fact, I suppose  one  could argue that if we had  lower and more  stable rates ofinflation,  we would also engender  more stable output.  I'm not sure that is implicit in the curvethat the  staff has in its chart.  Finally, and  Bob Parry  made this point, even  after taking account  ofthe bias, we  seem to be a good distance  away from  where  we ultimately need to be to achieveprice stability.  That  is the case no matter which of these measures  we look at, even with these 80percent  confidence  intervals.In any event, I believe  it is very constructive  to be talking about this.  I don't knowwhen  and  if the time would be right to go public with something like this.  I accept yourjudgment  that now is not the right time.  But, clearly, if we wanted to move  in this direction,  wewould have to cut through  some  of this.  In other  words, we  can continue to throw issues in  theair that arguably need to be  analyzed before  we presumably  have  enough confidence  to  go in thisdirection.  So, I have  always viewed  this sort of thing  as having  to be imposed from above whenthe  time is  right.  It is almost like a corporate  strategy where a decision  is  made and  is followedby efforts to  figure out how it should be implemented as opposed  to wandering  around in theweeds  and thinking about  all the problems  that could come up.  Clearly, this is not the right time,but we could study this forever and  never be comfortable with all the questions that could beraised.  Ultimately, if it is the right thing to do and the time is right, then we have to cut throughthe questions  and move  ahead.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I have  a couple  of comments.  First, Iagree that this is a  good paper  and the  right time to be talking  about this  issue.  It is  an issue thathas to be put  in the context,  as you mentioned,  of the more important goal of sustainable  growth.When we put it in that context,  it becomes  a very important discussion item.  From thatperspective,  what has been  brought to the table is  the realization  that, regardless of the pricemeasure we may have in mind,  we are not at price  stability.  That is something we should keep infront of us, continue  to talk about, and introduce to the public at some point so as  to broaden  itseducation  on this issue.  With that in mind, I think we  should take the  paper and  this discussionto the next step, namely  what it might mean from a policy standpoint and how we might proceed.With  regard to your point about looking  further ahead,  ten years  or whatever, toanticipate what will be  happening in the economy,  I agree that conditions then will  besubstantially different.  However,  I am not convinced  that prospective  changes  over that  periodwill be  substantially  more pronounced than those  we have gone through over the  past  10  or 15years.  How we deal  with the changes  ahead  is part  of this discussion of how we measure  pricesand define price stability.  We  are constantly  refining our thinking on that, and I think that iswhat we will have to continue  to do going forward.  In that regard,  having this analysis  andworking  definition  of price  stability  is very helpful and can assist us in  our discussions as  wework toward  making progress in achieving  our price stability objective.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let me  raise a related question that is  not on the tablelargely because,  to my knowledge, nobody around this table  supports the alternative  in question.I am  looking at page 2 of this memorandum.  That page follows an executive  summarycomprised of several pages.  The  second  sentence on page 2 under the heading  "Theoretical7/1-2/97Issues Related to the Choice of the Appropriate Price Index"  says  in part that "the  case for pricestability rests  on the  belief that inflation is  costly."  There is general  agreement  around  this tablethat inflation  is costly and  undesirable, but that  is not a universal  view.  That  view is not reallyaddressed  in this paper.  To the extent that we  want to go forward  in our pursuit of price  stability,we need to recognize the  absence of a universal  belief in the benefits  of price stability.  In  thisregard, I find that there  has been a very major change  in central  bank politics.  It is really  quiteremarkable  that all central banks  have  seized upon  this issue  as crucial.  Indeed,  if we  look at thecommuniques  of the G-7  summits, they all take the desirability  of price  stability as  a given.  Yet,we have papers like  the Akerlof-Dickens-Perry  article and a similar paper in Canada that areraising questions  about this basic policy objective.  The notion that  widespread support of pricestability is a given and  that all we have to do is to  assert it is really not quite there.  I looked atthe word  "belief'  in the sentence  that I quoted from, and it struck me  that if I were writing it, Iwould have said  "because the case for price stability  rests  on something other than belief."[Laughter]  It rests  on some  greater or higher conviction.  I hesitate because it is an interestingquestion.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  But if you are  a true believer, there is nothingstronger  than belief!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That may well be, but the true believer often has  greatdifficulty communicating  the reasons  for that belief to a third party.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Just to follow that up with some  examples:  Marty  Feldstein  has apaper in which  he tries to demonstrate  the importance of squeezing  out the last bit of inflation to7/1-2/97achieve  low inflation,  which he  defines as 2 percent.  All the countries that have zone  inflationtargeting  have  ranges of 1 to 3 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Part of that is the bias  question.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  It is, but it is what I call bias  plus a cushion. I think that  is the issuethat we really have to confront.  We need to do a little more work  on whether there  are  somecosts that outweigh the  benefits in eliminating  that last, say, percentage  point of inflation.  In thatregard,  we should keep  in mind that when  we look at the literature  on the  costs of inflation, wefind an enormous  nonlinearity  in those costs.  They  are very high at very high inflation rates.They are  discernible  for more modest inflation rates, but the fact is that below  8 or  10 percentinflation it is really hard to find that definitive  evidence.  So, I think we have  a long way to go inour research  to make that case  very definitively, particularly  for that last percentage  point.  Ithink we want  to be a little cautious.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I have a feeling that Dave  Stockton would not want to do that  studyagain!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The emphasis  is on "again."  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  Just  to add a brief observation on  the most recent point that  wasmade,  I would agree  that the importance  of zero  inflation is  an article  of faith among  centralbankers  and that we still have a lot of work ahead of us to make that case in society  as a whole.But that  is not my main point.I, too, thought that the paper was  quite helpful.  One of its main conclusions is  that  allthe broad measures  of inflation  that were examined tend to move together  over the long run but7/1-2/97not necessarily in the  short run.  Therein lies a dilemma for policymakers.  While we need  tokeep a focus on the  longer term when we  make monetary policy, we  still make it in the short runand  we have  to have justifications  that carry some  short-run  weight.  Even  if we ended  uppicking the "best"  measure  of inflation,  there would be periods  when it would lead  us astray andsome other measure or measures  would be more  accurate.  Therefore,  I think at least  one avenuethat we should pursue as  we  go further with this is to study the potential advantage  of a basket  ofprice  measures  that would enable us to monitor multiple price  indices rather than hangingeverything  on one.  The Committee  faced a  similar problem  in the period leading up toHumphrey-Hawkins  when we  were supposed  to target  money.  The question  then was what ismoney?  We  had M0,  Ml, M2,  M3,  and I think  at one time we had up to M8.  At some  point, onegoes too far.  My main point is that whatever may be the  strengths  and advantages  of individualmeasures  over time, in  any given period a single  measure can lead us astray.  While it is  a littleuntidy to look at a basket of measures,  I think it would  be helpful  as we go forward  to considersuch a basket as at least one alternative  way that we  might proceed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I also thought that the paper  was very well  done.  Itis a good step forward  in addressing  this issue, which is the type of longer-term  issue that isimportant  for this Committee  to review  from time to time.  I was  intrigued by Ed Boehne'ssuggestion  of considering  a basket of measures  at least  as one option.  I was coming at it in aslightly different  way.  If we are  going to choose one measure,  I have  a slight preference  forcontinuing  our focus  on the consumer price  index.  If we  are to have  a basket  of measures,  Iwould  say that the CPI has to be in that basket.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  You  can have  it first among equals.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  My preference  for the CPI  stems not  so much from  any technicalsuperiority  of that  measure but from  its familiarity  to the public.  Of all the inflation measures,  ithas  received the most attention.  If we were  to  switch the focus  from the CPI to one  other singlemeasure,  I think we would risk causing  a lot of confusion  and divert energy  away  from moreproductive  efforts  to educate  the public on the importance  of price stability.  But as others havenoted,  it doesn't  matter too much, according  to the memo, which  broad index  we choose if weare to choose one.  The reason is that if we  stabilize one  inflation  rate, we tend to stabilize themall.  And no matter which index  is chosen, the  simulations  suggest that economic  performancewould be enhanced.  So,  the important  thing is that we choose  some index  or basket  of indicesand then stick to the  goals of first capping  inflation and then moving  inflation rates down  untilwe achieve  price stability, however  we define  the latter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I, too,  thought it was  an excellent  and stimulating paper.  I don't thinkwe've had a dissenting vote on that  score.  We  do have to think a lot about where  we put ourmeasures  of inflation.  The broad  measures  are plausible  and they  all tend to move together  inany event.  I would concentrate  on studying  the costs  and benefits  of inflation because  I do notthink  we have been able to demonstrate  convincingly  that the benefits outweigh the costs whenwe try to reduce inflation  from a  level near the current  range.To  go back to Susan  Phillips'  point, I have the feeling  that part of the criticism that weget for being too focused  on inflation  is that we have not explained  it very well in  the past,  and7/1-2/97we have  not offered supporting  evidence  very well.  In  my view,  our credibility  would beenhanced,  not undermined,  by a serious  discussion.  Humphrey-Hawkins  may not be the rightvenue for it, but the more  we inform the public that there are  some real  issues here and we reallyare  thinking about them, the more  credibility I think we  will have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I suspect that  the last couple  of years are  going to giveus data  observation  points that  will be very helpful  to our case.  What we have  to demonstrateeffectively  is that the lower the rate  of inflation, the  higher the rate of productivity  growth.  If wecan demonstrate  that, we  can make the case  for low  inflation;  if we cannot,  it is a very tough caseto make, especially  as inflation  falls below  Larry Meyer's 8  or  10  percent range.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  There is a causality  question here.  You also have to look at whetherlow unemployment  gives  you high productivity growth and what the  tradeoff is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  If you cannot demonstrate  at least the covariation,  thenthe causation  issue never comes  up.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Rather than comment  on the paper directly, I would like to commenton your point a moment ago about the sentence  that has  the word "belief" in it--the belief thatinflation is costly.  Your statement was  that that belief may be universally  held  within thecommunity of central bankers,  who all want to go to central  banker heaven, but not necessarilyoutside that  small group. I will express  a view that I believe is a minority view around  thistable.  A lot of people have said that price  stability should be regarded  not as an  end in itself butas  a means to an end, and the latter should be maximum sustainable  growth.  While pricestability is  a means  to that end,  I think it is a worthy end in itself, and we lose a lot by notemphasizing  that.  It is a little easier for me to think about that distinction  if I borrow what I7/1-2/97believe  is Jerry Jordan's  view  of the distinction  between price  stability  and stability  in the  valueof the monetary unit.  The government  issues something that  we call  a dollar, and  it is  ourresponsibility to take care of that dollar.  People are  using those  dollars as a  store of value, and  Ithink we  have  something of a moral obligation  to protect  the value of that dollar regardless  ofstatistical  studies about whether  1 percent  or 2 percent  or 3 percent inflation might maximize  realgrowth.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think we  try to make that point periodically.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I believe we may overdo  the  point that price stability  is a meansrather than  an end.  I would like to go back to  Henry Wallich's  famous  speech  about thedistinction between  sound  money  and honest money.  He made some  good points there  abouthonest  money.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  As the  person who may well have  spent less career  time puzzling  overthese issues,  I probably have  learned more  than anybody  around the table  from this exercise.  Ihave  come to the simple  conclusion  that the differences  among the primary  indices that  havebeen  studied are quite  small compared  to our ability  to control  inflation  and hit some price target.I may be the  most cynical of all the  members who have  spoken on the  question  of thepublic's understanding  of our inflation goal. In my  view, we are  well short of any ability toexplain why we need  to squeeze  out the last bit of inflation.  I don't think we've gotten to firstbase in terms of achieving a general  public understanding  of the benefits  of lowering inflationeven from 2-1/2 percent  to 2 percent.  When I make speeches  or talk to smart business peopleabout it, their eyes glaze over.  As  persuasive  as you  are, Mr. Chairman,  I don't know  whether  I7/1-2/97would like to see you try to explain to Congress  in your upcoming  Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony why it is desirable to push inflation  down even  1/2 percentage  point from its currentlevel, much less to get all  the way  to price  stability.  I may have missed the sermon, not  havingbeen at the table  for as long as  most of you, in terms of having  gotten this religion,  but I know inmy heart and everything  I ever studied that moving toward  price stability is  the right thing to do.Unfortunately,  the current  state of public understanding of this concept,  or even  of pushinginflation somewhat below its current level,  is so  minimally advanced that I cannot imagine  usbeing in a position  to use  that as a justification  for our near-term policy  actions without  engagingin a great deal  more educational  effort.  Again, I know I come to this debate  later than manyother people, but I do not think we can underestimate  the need to talk about this.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We have to be a little careful  about misreading this inone respect.  What the polls show is that when the inflation rate  is very low  no one is worriedabout inflation.  Trying to convince  them that inflation is a problem  when they do not perceive  itto  be one, basically because  it is  already low, is very difficult.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  That's  what I am trying  to say.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The best time to try to  argue a move from 2-1/2 to 2percent is  when the inflation  rate is at  10 percent!  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I must say that I, too,  enjoyed reading this paper.  When  I cameback from one of our meetings  five or six months ago,  where yet  another index was  raised as apossibility to consider,  I challenged  the people in  Boston to tell me which of these indices werebad, which were  good, and which  we really should be looking at.  Staff here did a lot moreintensive  work on this issue, but I  was glad to see that the overall conclusion  in the two sets of7/1-2/97studies was about the same.  Particular  measures  may have  some advantages  and disadvantagesat the margin, but it really  doesn't make  a whole  lot of difference  which measure  we look at.  So,that  was comforting,  at least  from my point of view.One of the things that  impressed  me was how stable  things have  been for a 4- or5-year period no matter  which one  of these indices we look at and compare to this confidenceband around  some definition  of price  stability.  Depending on which index  we look at, theoutcome  may differ for a particular  year but the stability  over the last several  years is quitestriking.  With reference  in particular to your comment  about financial  stability, Mr. Chairman,  itseems to me that we do not  spend a lot of time thinking  about fluctuations  in inflation  at a lowlevel  versus pushing  it down to a particular number.  I am  a bit uncomfortable  with the idea offocusing  on a particular  target number for inflation.  The reason is in  part because  I agree  withGovernor Meyer's  thoughts  on the  desirability of a  cushion  and in part because I would hate tobe  forced by  some published number into doing  something--or  even  thinking about doingsomething--at  a point in time when that would not be the right thing to do for purposes offinancial stability.  That  does not mean we  should not have  some  settled idea among  ourselves  ofwhere we  are headed,  but published  numbers  make me  nervous.I am wondering  whether it is possible  to think about a  stable band of inflation asopposed to pushing the rate  down continually, with fluctuations  occurring within that band,however we may want to measure  it.  What concerns me  the most about  developments  over thepast year is that we may get ourselves  into a situation  where we could have  a boom/bustenvironment  in which  we might have  to overreact  and induce negative economic  growth.  Ofcourse, we  would not be reacting  strongly except  to stabilize  conditions when  they got  out of7/1-2/97hand.  I wonder  if more of our attention  could be  focused on fostering  stability as opposed toratcheting  inflation  down  to a particular  number.  I realize  I am not being very eloquent  inexpressing this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Not  at all.  You are  in effect raising the question  that wewere discussing before,  namely,  can we  demonstrate  that as the inflation  rate falls, the rate  ofgrowth in productivity  continues  to increase?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Because that  is the basic determinant  that tells uswhether  in fact the  system is functioning.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We do not have  enough  data points  in recent history tobe able  to make  that judgment.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  one part of this fascinating discussion  leaves  me alittle nervous.  There  are many  intriguing  questions here that we can  ponder.  We  can  spend agreat  deal  of time doing  so if we allow ourselves  to focus on such  questions as what is money,and are prices  necessarily  the most relevant  way to measure whatever  we will  want to measure  intomorrow's  world.  These  are important questions,  but we must not lose sight of the fact  that wehave to manage  policy and  the related  question  of how  we should manage  policy in  a lowinflation era.  We are in  such an era.  We  may not be at price level stability, however  someoneat show  inflation rising between  1 and  2 percent  and  the trend is flat.  A few indices  are  in the 2to 3  percent  area, but I don't think  any are over 3  percent  at this point.  Much of the discussion7/1-2/97on price level  stability is focused  on inflation rates  in  the  1 to 3  percent  area.  We  have tomanage  policy in that framework,  and there are  some rather imminent  questions.Larry Meyer raises probably the  most basic question,  and that is, what  is sociallyoptimal  in this era?  If it is a range,  what is the range?  Should policy respond  differently toinflation  when it is  at a low  absolute level  than it does when it is high?  A one percentage  pointdifference  in the inflation  level  may mean  something entirely different  when the absolute level is5 or 6 percent  as opposed  to when it  is  1 or 2 percent.  And if policy should respond  differently,how should it respond?  If we are going to  get  down to lower levels of inflation,  we  are  going tostart having more  and more pockets  of deflation.  How  should we think about those,  and to whatextent is that an  acceptable  condition?  In  sum, low  inflation  has its own problems as we  allknow.  But we have  not  had to face  them, and I think we could very  well get ourselves  in asituation where we may need to face  them.  So,  there are some  very practical  problems that weneed  to work on  even while  we  are  thinking about  these longer-term, perhaps  a little moretheoretical, kinds  of concerns.  I guess  my plea is, let's give  a large amount of attention  to thosenearer-term problems  while we are  dealing with the others.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Let me make  several brief observations:  In terms of the generalquestion  of the overall value  of low inflation,  it seems to me that we  actually have  developedsome evidence.  If we think  about the  performance  of the U.S. economy  in the  1960s,  much ofthe  1980s, and much  of this decade,  those have been periods  of very favorable economicperformance  and periods of relatively low  inflation.  This does not prove causality,  but if we  stepaway from the rigor that economists  might want to apply  and think of the general public, it seems7/1-2/97to me that we  are  in the process of developing  some very practical  evidence.  That does not get towhat I think is the  tougher question--and  I agree  with Larry Meyer and Cathy  Minehan  on this--of demonstrating  that there is a significant payoff to reducing inflation further from,  say, 3  or2-1/2 percent.  I think that is  a very significant  challenge.  I don't  think we have the evidence  thatwould convince  skeptics that that is a sensible and  sound thing to  do.Finally, and I raise this only  as  a question, I wonder whether it is preferable  to have  abasket of inflation  measures  as opposed to one measure.  This paper  suggests that as long as wepick a broad index,  we are not in  any danger of going  significantly  off course over an extendedperiod of time.  It seems to me that when we were working  with  the monetary aggregates,  wereally were doing  something a little different.  We were trying various  combinations andpermutations  of bank and other liabilities, knowingly changing the concept.  Here I think weknow the general  concept  and that it does not make  a lot of difference empirically  what  specificmeasure  we choose.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, it  seems to me  that what we aretalking about,  directly or indirectly,  is whether  there should be  a publicly stated,  publicly  agreedupon goal of monetary policy.  By that  I mean a goal that is a little more clear to the citizens ofour country than what I would describe  as  the goal of sustained economic  growth to be achievedthrough price stability,  which in turn  is not defined with a  number.  In  fact, I use your workingdefinition.  In my view, there would be a benefit if we  had a more clearly  stated goal of pricestability today because it would give us better signals.  We could stop this debate  and we wouldbe more  accountable  to the  American people  in that they would have  a better idea of what we are7/1-2/97supposed  to be doing and whether  we are  doing it.  But  in  a democracy,  one has to be extremelypragmatic.  Given  the absence  of absolute certainty  about what  we  are supposed  to be  doing, wehave  in fact been very  successful  in bringing down  the level  of inflation.  Despite  having donethat, however, the political  criticism  of the central  bank  has been increasing.  We  are  not beingparticularly rewarded for  our achievement;  instead,  there has been  increasing questioning.Going back to the  Humphrey-Hawkins  report and testimony,  I think we  should be veryclear  about  what we think  ought to be the goal  of monetary  policy before  we  go out  and startselling it.  We do not quite know what  to sell because  we  have not  agreed  on it, and we have tobe very certain  that what  we attempt  to sell will make  it more  likely that we will  be able  to carryout policy more effectively  rather than less.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus,  you are  going to have to close usdown.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Most of the comments  I wanted to  make  on the  paper havealready  been made, in many  cases  more than once,  so  I will make just a  quick comment  on thebroader  issue  of the desirability  of price level  stability, which  has come up in  an interestingdiscussion. I have only a  couple of points.  One is,  as  Gary Stern mentioned,  that a lot of workhas  already  been  done to  support the idea that  price stability  is a desirable  longer-term  objectivefor any central bank.  I thought  a lot of good evidence  in  support  of that view  was summarizedat the Kansas  City conference  at Jackson  Hole  last year.My second point is  a little more  vague.  Let  me put  it this  way:  I do not  think weshould underestimate  the  degree  of appreciation  that already  exists  among the  public concerningthe desirability  and benefits  of something  approaching  price level stability.  I see in everyday  life7/1-2/97and hear in conversations  a growing  realization  that at least part of the explanation  for theuniversally recognized  good macro  economic  performance  has something  to do with the way weare conducting  monetary  policy and our focus on  low inflation  and eventual  price  stability.  Likea stew,  one has to let that  appreciation  steep,  and it will  slowly but surely  grow.  What we needto do, it seems  to me, is to  reinforce  it in every way  we can.  One dimension  of price  stability forme is not just the current inflation  numbers, but the very  important  expectational  component.We need to reinforce the  view that we  are going to maintain the progress  we have made,  and Ithink that will  pay off over time.  I think we need  to have  a strategy,  and it needs  to be as  clear asit can  be.  In my view, this paper is a  good first step in helping  us to build  that strategy  andaddress the related  tactics as  we  go  forward.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Unless anyone  has any  final words,  I think Al Broaddushas completed  this session on a very  good note.  Congratulations  to the staff who took animpossible  subject and  made it slightly  less  so.[Meeting  recessed]7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We turn  to a discussion  of the long-run ranges  for themonetary  aggregates,  and I call on Tom  Simpson.

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will  be referring to the handout called"Material  for Staff Presentation  on Money and  Debt Ranges."  [Statement  and related handout--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Tom, going  back to the  bottom panel of Exhibit 3, Iwould assume that  if we  were  to substitute  gross domestic  income for gross domestic  product,the most recent data  would not look as  good as they do because  we would be getting higher V2.

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  Right,  the points would be farther apart.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Have you  actually  done the calculations to  see what thatwould look like?  In other  words, is part of the tightness  of fit that we see a function  of thewidening  statistical  discrepancy  in the national accounts  or is it de minimis?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think we are  only talking about  .02 on this  scale.  I don't  think itwould greatly  alter the  recent picture.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Especially if the revision went back a couple  of years.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It's a question  of starting points for thinking  about this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  But the  gap has been opening up since  1994,  so V2shifts up  progressively over time from the observations  you have here.  The most recentobservations  are  on top of the  fitted line,  so we would expect  a little more  of a drift.

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  It  could alter the slope.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I don't know  how significant it is,  but it  does raisesome questions.  Since we have  so few  observations,  it is not clear to  me what is  happening.President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Also with reference  to Exhibit  3, it seems  to me  that developments  inthe  last couple of years  clearly are  encouraging.  If we focus  on the bottom panel  of the exhibit,it also seems  clear that  velocity  is continuing to change.  In particular, if one  had run thatregression  to include  the forecast period, it would have  produced  a different  velocity.  So, thisexhibit  seems encouraging  to me, but it also  illustrates that it would  be a mistake  to assume thatvelocity  is now stable.

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  Right.  As was  mentioned in the  Bluebook,  we thought that M2velocity  was being boosted  somewhat this  year by continuing  very large inflows  to mutual funds,presumably  involving  diversions  from M2 accounts.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  It is  also the case  that when we fit these  things econometrically,  we findsmall time  trends both for the  period  covered by the bottom  line and for that covered  by the top.Thus,  the  charts show  bigger misses relative to the fitted  line than there are  in our modelsbecause  the models have  this time trend in them.  But I think your basic  point is still correct.  Insome sense,  it is amazing  how little velocity has  shifted up given the huge  flows into stockmutual  funds.

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  If you look at the upper panel, an  alternative interpretation  would bethat the big upward movement in  the early part of the  1990s  has slowed rather than come to  anend.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Other questions?  President Jordan.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  A couple  of things:  With regard  to your question, Mr.  Chairman, wetoo have  looked at this  with gross domestic  purchases  instead of nominal  GDP and also  thecommand basis  of GDP.  That's because  we are  trying to  relate money  held to householdincome  and the  command  of U.S.  citizens over resources.  It does change the picture  a little.  Thestatistical relationship  of MZM is better in terms of the  stability of the  functional  relationship.The series  is volatile  because  of the higher interest  elasticity, but we  still get a tighter fit withMZM, especially  if we use gross domestic purchases  or the command  basis.My other question,  a real  question, is how to complete the picture of the NAIRUalternative.  The Bluebook presents  almost  a "for your information"  kind of alternative  thatassumes  the NAIRU is 4.8 percent,  and then it really  doesn't do anything  with it.  It would behelpful,  to me anyway,  to have Exhibit 4 completed to include  what  would be implied for thevelocities  of the three aggregates  under that assumption  and then the  appropriate  ranges for theaggregates.  You might choose not to change the  nominal funds rate,  so opportunity  costs wouldnot change, but the lower NAIRU  has to have  an implication  for your choice  of the  appropriateranges.

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  As I mentioned,  with a supply shock of this sort and particularly  ifthe Committee  wanted to see  more of that  shock show through  in terms of real output, we wouldget more nominal GDP and  more  money growth.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  On that low  NAIRU  alternative, we would have  small effects onnominal GDP and  lower inflation.  It is not clear which way nominal GDP would go since wewould have higher output and lower inflation.  Actually, I think nominal GDP would be a bitlower in that scenario than in the baseline  scenario.  Interest rates  would not be  rising, which7/1-2/97would help boost M2,  but nominal  GDP would be a little lower because inflation  would be somuch lower.  So, I don't  know which way it would go, but my guess is that the net effect wouldnot alter our projection of M2 a great deal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions for Tom?  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  Tom, could you expand  a bit on  Exhibit  1, which  shows  growth infederal  debt turning up?

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  That is basically  in keeping  with the slightly larger  deficit that weare projecting for  1998.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Does that take the current budget negotiations  into account?

[SECTION]

MR.  SIMPSON.  It has  our assumed  fiscal package.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  You will  recall that  our unified  deficit forecast for the next fiscal  year issomewhat  larger than the deficit for this fiscal year.  On a  calendar-year basis, because of thetiming of borrowing  and other means of payment  or cash flows in  the federal  government, wehave more of a step-up  in borrowing than  one would have expected  on the basis of the  unifieddeficits for the two fiscal  years.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further questions for Tom?  It strikes me that M2is creeping its  way back into potential  use.  This creates interesting  questions including the needto review  issues that were raised yesterday  such as reserve requirements  and contemporaneousreserves.  All these  issues, including the longer-term  target ranges,  are in the same  package.  Thatis  to the extent that M2 has no appreciable  monetary policy significance,  then,  of course, theranges are  irrelevant  except in the sense that they have a  technical meaning  as do reserve7/1-2/97balances  and similar measures.  Frankly, the less we do  in  any of these areas,  the better weprobably  are.  That  is because  anything we do that is  not required by sweeps,  for example, orother unavoidable  technical  problems elevates  the issue of money  supply to a level  that does notconform  with the  way in which we currently  employ the monetary  aggregates.My impression  of the current ranges  for the aggregates  is that at some point weprobably  will have to change  them to capture  and center the expected  outcomes.  But for now Iwould be inclined  simply  to reproduce  what we wrote  6 months and  12  months  ago as  reasonsfor not changing the  ranges and save ourselves a lot  of typeface.  There  you have  a true costcutter at the Federal Reserve!  [Laughter]  It  is rather  fascinating to recall  how good the forecastsfor the growth  of the aggregates  have  been.  In retrospect, the M2 forecast of a year ago wasright on the money.  If M2  growth continues that way,  we will have to  make a decision,  and  avery significant  decision,  about the M2 range.  The irony of having  such  a good forecast  is thatwe  are exactly where we  were a year ago.  My own preference,  frankly, would be to retain theranges that we have.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I agree  with that to the  extent that we decide  not to change  the  waywe use the ranges  for the  monetary  aggregates.  But in anticipation  of the  possibility that in one,two,  three or more Humphrey-Hawkins  hearings down  the road we may want to give a littledifferent weight to the information  M2 is providing,  I think it would be useful  to  start preparingthe Congress  and the  public for the  change.  We would alert them that the change would not be areturn to the 1970s  kind of monetary  targeting but rather that we intended  to use these  aggregatesas a contemporaneous  monitor of how  our policy actions  are interacting  with the real  economy.  Ibelieve  it would be a mistake to allow people on the outside  to think that we  will go back to7/1-2/97setting target  ranges  in the forward-looking  sense that they could provide information to triggerincreases  or decreases  in the  federal funds  rate.  Rather, if a range is used for monitoring  andespecially if, as the staff paper says, the feedback effects  of interactions--the  simultaneousdetermination  aspect of nominal  income and money--are  getting more weight, then we  will wantto characterize  that range  as a monitor of what is  going on in the economy.  It is telling ussomething about the  demand for central  bank money and is not a target  that we are trying to hit.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We actually  have  started to do that  at the fringes inCongressional  testimony.  If these  relationships hold, I think we will gradually increase  ouremphasis  on the aggregates.  In that event, this Committee is going to reach a crucial point whenwe will  have to decide  whether we should  start to do  something more formal.  That is going  to bean  interesting discussion,  in part because I think each of us will have slightly different  timeframes  in mind.  I must admit that I happen to  agree  with the view that if we get the sense thatwe are going to lock in on the  aggregates,  we will soon find ourselves backing  off, to ourchagrin.  But that remains  for a later discussion.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree with your suggestion  and support  alternative  I.It seems to me that M2 velocity  is coming closer to stabilizing, but I don't think  we have enoughevidence  yet to put more weight on the  aggregates  at this time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I  also agree  with your suggestion  and  would prefer tostay with  alternative I.  I want to comment, though,  on a point that Jerry Jordan made.  As  I readthe Bluebook this time, I found myself facing  a choice.  If I concluded  that I wanted to use theseaggregates  as indicators  of our projections,  then I would choose  one alternative.  If I decided  to7/1-2/97use  them as targets  with an  assumed velocity,  I would choose  another.  If we  do get to the  pointwhere  we are starting  to put weight on these  aggregates,  I think  we will need a careful  discussionof how we want to use them.  Otherwise,  we are  going  to have  split votes as we tend to do onissues such as the interpretation  of alternative  I versus  alternative  II.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I have  an old P-star memo sitting at the bottom of mydesk that might help.  I could blow off the  dust and pull it out!  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I, too,  agree we should not change the ranges for all  the reasons thatpeople  have given  here today  and that I mentioned  the  last couple of times we talked  about  this.Until we know exactly how we are  using these measures  of money in the  formulation  andimplementation  of monetary policy, I think we are well  advised to keep  the  ranges the  way theyare.  I would also encourage  some further discussion  down the road  of exactly how to use thesemeasures  should these  trends continue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  I am delighted to see that M2 is doing  better.  I thought that the  moredetailed  memo that we received  was very helpful  and moved the ball a little farther down thefield.  I agree with your proposal,  Mr. Chairman;  I do not think we  should change the ranges  atthis time.  But I would align  myself with Jerry  Jordan's comments  because  I think it would beuseful  to start to talk about the way we see M2 changing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I certainly agree with  your recommendation.  Ihave  to say that I am  impressed by the increasing  evidence that M2 may be coming back ontrack.  We produced  some supporting  research  at our Bank  to supplement  the excellent  staff7/1-2/97paper that  was done here.  On  the basis of the analysis that I have seen,  I think a case can bemade, and the Bluebook indicates  this,  for setting the provisional  range  for 1998  under theassumption that M2 will continue  to reassert  its old pattern.  But I would not want to do thatquite yet.  One of the attractive  things about the  1 to 5 percent range  for M2, which has beenaround for a  while, is that in a sense it is  the closest thing we  have to a nominal  anchor in theabsence  of an inflation target  or similar target.  I  would be reluctant  to give that up.  Having saidthat,  I think that  if we continue  to see evidence over the remainder of 1997 that M2 is comingback  strongly  on track, we probably ought to consider changing its  1998 range when we takeanother look at it in February.  That's because, with  more normal behavior,  M2 could actuallycome  out near the top end of a 1 to 5 percent range,  and we might  feel  a little uncomfortableabout maintaining  that range as we move into  1998.I would like  to make a couple  of additional  comments  that focus  on our longer-termstrategy.  In these Humphrey-Hawkins  meetings in recent years,  I have  used this  agenda item asan opportunity  to make  a pitch for inflation  targets,  and I sometimes  have recommended,  Mr.Chairman,  that you might be a little more  precise in your testimony  about our objective ofholding the line on  inflation.  I want to say that  I still  think these are  very worthy ideas,  and Ihope they will get some weight and attention.  But you all  know how I feel  on this issue, and  Iwill  not repeat  my arguments  today.I would like,  though, to make a brief comment on a closely related  matter, one that Ithink is an  increasingly  serious issue from the  standpoint  of the strategy  and conduct  of ourlonger-run monetary policy.  These points  are related  to some of the things  that Jerry Jordan  saidyesterday.  That is, in  the absence of a clear  and firm nominal  anchor for policy, almost all of the7/1-2/97public's attention  to monetary policy focuses  on the  federal  funds rate and  the prospect that itthe single-mindedness  and intensity  of this  public focus is, if anything,  a little stronger than itconduct  of policy going forward.In particular,  there now seems  to be a widespread tendency  to view  almost any tacticalincrease in the federal  funds rate  as an effort on our part to reduce  inflation by restrainingeconomic  growth, even  if the objective  really is only to hold the  line on inflation.  As a result,almost any funds rate increase these  days is  going to turn into a  lightning rod.  In this  situation, Ithink it is very important  that we make  every effort to  do a better job of explaining to the publichow we expect the funds rate that we  target, and  for that matter other short-term  interest rates,  tobehave in the current regime  and  why.  Specifically,  I think we need to make  the point that in thecurrent environment,  where  actual  inflation is low and our anti-inflationary  credibility isrelatively  high, though maybe  not perfect,  short-term nominal interest rates  are  essentiallyshort-term real  interest rates, and  short-term real rates routinely  will have  to move up and  downin order to clear credit markets.Dave  Stockton made  a point like this in his Chart Show comments  yesterday.Whenever  future  income prospects brighten  relative to current prospects or perceived  permanentincome  rises, however we  want to  describe it, both households  and business firms  are going towant to borrow against that anticipated  future income,  and demand for credit will rise.  In thatsituation,  short-term real rates need  to rise to maintain  the  balance of supply and  demand  incredit  markets,  and the Fed needs  to let that happen.  The point is--and this is really the main7/1-2/97point I want to make--that  actions  like this on  our part are not restrictive  monetary policy actionsas they are  usually portrayed in the press and  elsewhere.  They are neutralizing  actions. In thosesituations,  we really  are not tightening policy;  we simply are  doing the minimum needed to holdthe line on inflation and maintain the  current inflation rate.  Far from endangering the expansion,it seems to  me these kinds  of actions  are essential  to sustaining it.  They  do not really  pose thekinds of risk to the economy that some of our actions  necessarily did in the mid-1980s  when wewere indeed tightening policy in an  effort to reduce  inflation at a time when our credibility  wasrelatively low.I realize  that while these points may make  good economic  sense and may bepersuasive  to some  people, putting  a pretty  face on  a funds rate increase  is a tough sell when weare  dealing with the media or Congress  or the general public  for that matter.  I think we need tofind  a way to get this message  across  and to be persistent  in doing so.  I thought you made somesimilar points very  effectively in your NYU speech,  Mr. Chairman.  We need to do more  of thatwhenever  we get the chance, and it strikes  me that your upcoming testimony might be a goodopportunity for another tutorial.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think we were  well aware  of what would happen  whenwe  shifted to an explicit federal  funds rate target.  As you may recall,  we fought off thatapparently  inevitable day as  long as we could.  We ran into the situation, as you may remember,when the money supply, nonborrowed  reserves,  and various  other non-interest-rate  measures  onwhich the  Committee had focused had  in turn fallen by the wayside.  We  were left with interestrates  because we had no alternative.  I think it is still in a sense our official policy that if we canfind a way back to where we  are able to target the  money supply or net borrowed  reserves  or7/1-2/97some other non-interest  measure  instead of the federal  funds rate, we would like  to do that.  I amnot sure we will be  able to return  to such a regime and  in the process  create a whole  new army  ofFed watchers  who  interpret what we are  doing, but the reason  is not that we enthusiasticallyembrace  targeting the  federal funds rate.  We did it as  an unfortunate fallback  when we had noother options,  and I think the consequences  are  much  as we anticipated.  The  way to get aroundthis problem is to meet it head on, and instead of saying that we  are moving  rates up to curbinflation,  we should say that we  are moving them up to sustain  long-term employment  growth.That is effectively  what  our argument  is,  and it is the right argument.  It  involves bypassing theintermediate  inflationary  imbalances  issue in a lot of these discussions.My opinion  is that from a public  relations point of view it is very hard to sell lowinflation  when  we already have  low  inflation. It works only in  a period like the late  1970s wheneveryone  was terrified of the consequences  of inflation  and  the Federal  Reserve effectively  had amandate.  We do not have a mandate now, and the reason  is that we have  been  successful.  It isthe fallout  of being  successful that  we have  to handle.  It is a very  difficult  and complex publicrelations  issue.  But we have to realize  that if we fail to  succeed  in the public  relations,  we maystill have to move ahead  and  do what we have to do and take the consequences.  We still have todo our job.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I agree with all of that.  My point is that while  we currently havelow inflation, we do not really  have what I would  regard  as a firm nominal anchor  in aforward-looking  sense.  In that kind of environment,  the  operating  regime that we have,  as yousaid, presents  risks.  I don't know if there is an  easy way to do it, but we need to take everyopportunity  to make it clear that  short rates  will move  around.  They may have to go up, and that7/1-2/97hit some target.  That is not correct economics,  and we need to get  that point across  any  way wecan.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I agree  with your recommendation.  As  I understandit, we would  describe  the  money ranges as  we did last time, namely as benchmarks  for what wewould normally expect  under conditions  of reasonable  price stability  and historic velocitybehavior.With regard to the  discussion you were  having with Al Broaddus,  a few  of us weretalking about the same  issue before  the meeting.  I think the  sense of our discussion  was to agreecompletely  with exactly how  you phrased  the need to communicate  the basis for our monetarypolicy actions,  namely by saying that our objective is  to encourage  continued recovery,  sustainedeconomic  growth, and further increases  in employment.  I realize that this is a very difficult andcomplex  public relations  issue,  as  you said, but I think that is the right track to go on.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I will tell you, Mike,  one thing that has to  be consideredhere is the moral tone.  In the NYU  speech,  I said that  it is irresponsible  to take the  risks that areinvolved in not trying  to contain inflationary  imbalances.  If we give only the other side  of theargument, they will beat us nine times out of nine on a moral  argument.  That is what they havebeen doing.  And if we  allow that to happen,  we deserve  to be beat upon because  I am persuadedthat we do have the moral high ground.  We have a long-term focus rather than a short-termexpediency  rationale.  We believe in insurance,  which is a well  established long-term risk-aversetype  of activity.  I think all the ethical,  moral issues are  on our side.  Short-termism--all of the7/1-2/97expediency issues--is  what effectively  is on the other  side, and their  advocates  make  it sound asthough that is the moral  high ground.  I think our allowing that to happen  is unfortunate.  Itmerely  says how good they  are, because  if I had  to make  their case,  I would not be  able to do itas well as they.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I agree  with everything  you have just said.  I believe  that we need  tospend more time thinking  about how we can best communicate  that message.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I absolutely agree  with that because  the focus  of outsidecommentary  on monetary  policy in  recent months  has not been  as  good as it should have been.Considering what is going on in the world,  it is really unbelievable.  Vice  Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree that we should  adoptalternative  I.  I think it is far too early to conclude that the recent  fit in  V2, and therefore  the useof M2,  is anything like a sure thing.  One of the things  I believe  we have to  be  aware of is theeffect of a change in market focus on a monetary  measure.  We may have  a monetary  aggregatethat tracks  reasonably well when we are  not using it  as a policy tool.  Therefore,  it is a matter ofpassing interest but essentially of indifference  to the marketplace.  On  the other hand,  if we startusing it as  a tool, the markets  are  going to concentrate  on it a lot more,  and it may pick up  adegree of volatility related  only to its being used as a policy tool.On the broader issue of explaining what we  are doing, it seems to me that  aconcentration  on economic  growth and the creation  of jobs  is where the high ground is locatedand is what we appropriately  are dedicated  to.  That  is why I use price  stability as a means to anend, not as an end  in itself.  I  also like the clarity involved  in talking  about an interest ratebecause  people in the real  world understand interest  rates.  They do not understand  reserve levels7/1-2/97or all this other  arcane  stuff that we like  to discuss.  Our use of the latter  appears to them as  aneffort to obfuscate.  It will be more understandable  to them if we  say that we believe in long-termeconomic  growth, we believe that monetary  policy is a very effective  tool to bring that about,and the tool that we  have  is the overnight  interest rate.  When we decide  that we have to shift theovernight interest  rate as a means of working toward  that long-term  goal, people may not like it,but at least they will understand it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes,  granted how far we have come.  I think the onlyway  we could  go back to some non-interest-rate regime--let's  assume it involved a net borrowedreserve number--would  be if we believed that analytically  such  an  approach  had become  themost efficient means to implement  policy.  We could identify our net borrowed  reserves  target,but instead of associating  it with that huge range that we used to set for the  federal funds rate, wecould indicate  that we expected  it to be consistent with  a federal  funds rate within a relativelynarrow range.  So, we would  still in fact have  some focus on the  federal funds rate.  If we believethat the literal fixing  of the  federal funds rate is  an inappropriate  policy--a conclusion we maywell reach  at some point because  theoretically  it's very hard to make a  case that  fixing the rate  isthe optimal  way to  conduct  monetary policy--how  we would reword the directive would  be ofsome importance,  but  we would then have what we would view as a  superior mechanism to carryout our policy.  We could explain that we expected  this approach to policy to engender a federalfunds rate between,  say, 5-1/4  and 5-1/2 percent or some narrow  range like that.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I would be very comfortable  with that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think we could  defend it.  Governor Meyer.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Tom Simpson's presentation  of theBluebook alternatives  for the Humphrey-Hawkins  ranges identified two distinct decisions thatwe have to make  today, and  also a third decision that  we might want to talk about andcontemplate.  The first is the  interpretation  of the ranges;  the second is the boundary  of theranges; and the third is whether we  want to upgrade  the role of monetary  aggregates in ourmonetary policy process.I must admit that when I came  here, I was initially uneasy  about the currentinterpretation  of the M2 range that related it to some  hypothetical period of price stability andnormal  velocity behavior.  That interpretation  seemed to me to be inconsistent  with the spirit andthe letter of the Federal  Reserve  Act.  But I have come to appreciate  that such an interpretationmight have  evolved as  a quite reasonable  compromise,  given the  instability of the monetaryaggregates.  On the one hand, we  are told to set a range.  On the other, the instability of themonetary  aggregates  prevents us from  doing so in  a meaningful  way--or  from using the monetaryaggregates  in a meaningful  way--in the policy process.  Now that there is evidence  of improvedstability of M2, I think we have to ask  whether this continues to be  a reasonable  compromise.I agree with the Chairman  that despite early  signs of improved M2 stability,  it ispremature  to reach  that conclusion.  I would  say that we really have  not stress-tested  thisrelationship yet.  It has proved  stable through  a very  tranquil period,  and  I don't think we wantto make  the move back to the earlier interpretation  and then have to reverse  ourselves when wefind that we are in a more turbulent period.Having  said that, I think the Bluebook  also challenges  us a bit because it points outthat some interesting issues are involved  in  setting the target  ranges under the current7/1-2/97interpretation.  Although  we have been talking  and easing  our way through  discussions aboutwhether  we should have  explicit inflation targets,  in a sense what we  have been doing  under thisinterpretation  is to set target ranges for the monetary  aggregates that  in effect become  inflationtargets.  Given that that  is their role, we might  want to consider over time whether they reallyare  in line with where  we want them to be.  The discussion  in the Bluebook  is very  interesting.  Itpoints out that the ranges are aligned very closely with what we might  discern to be true pricestability.  Then the question  is, as  I pointed out yesterday,  whether we really want our inflationtarget to be true price  stability or maybe  true price  stability with a cushion. It forces us intomaking that choice.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I would say that what you are suggesting,  and I wouldagree, is that when  we get to the point of discussing these issues we  should combine  thembecause they are interrelated

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Right.  It is  premature  to get into that at this point, but  I thought thediscussion in the Bluebook was quite  interesting and challenging.  Even  if we do not want  to  goback to the earlier practice,  there might be a case  for upgrading a little the role  of the monetaryaggregates  in our deliberations.  We could ask the staff to bring to the Committee informationthat they  glean from the monetary aggregates  that they think might  be useful to the monetarypolicy  process.  Having  said that, I do not think there is necessarily any going back to the earlierpractice.  I would only suggest that there is an element  of hysteresis  in the  monetary policyprocess.  The way we view monetary  aggregates  has evolved  over time in part because we havehad to adjust to the instability  of those aggregates.  In the process,  we began to give more weightto our ultimate objectives,  an implicit inflation  target and a stabilization  objective--a  Taylor rule7/1-2/97kind of procedure.  We are focusing  more on the  ultimate objectives  and less on intermediatetargets.  Despite the instability of M2 over  the years,  our track record  is quite good.  We mightwonder whether we really  want to go back to the earlier importance  of the target ranges  even  ifM2 becomes  more  stable.At any rate, I would  concur that we should retain the current interpretation  and notelevate  the  role of the monetary aggregates.  I would not modify the current ranges; I would juststay with  them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  To return  to the issue of whether or not we are  againstinflation  or for jobs,  was I mistaken,  Jerry, or were  you quoted in the James  Glassman newspapercolumn yesterday  or the day before?

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  I hope not.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I thought it was you that  he quoted.  He was talkingabout the issue of job creation,  and the example came  up as to why somebody in a Chinese  cityhad everyone working  with  shovels to build a dam.  Was he  quoting you?

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  That may have  come from a speech  that I gave.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Why don't you set  it straight for us.  This actuallyrefers to the issue of whether  it is jobs or growth that we  ought to be focused on.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  It was in  a speech where  I said that  a Western  businessman travelingin China visited a site where hundreds  of workers  were  building an  earthen dam with shovels.The businessman suggested  that they could get an earth-moving  piece  of equipment  to build thatdam in  an afternoon.  The Chinese official  asked what could be  done  about all the unemploymentthat would create.  The businessman replied that he  now understood.  He thought they were7/1-2/97building  a dam, but the  Chinese authorities really were  trying to create  work for people.  So, hehad a  suggestion to make, namely  to take  away their shovels  and give them  spoons.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I don't think we  ought to repeat that  suggestion  in toomany places!  It is in fact  an effective  argument  against creating jobs directly  rather thanfostering economic  growth to create jobs.  There  are  stages that should not be short-circuited  inthat process;  they involve  controlling inflation in order to promote  growth  and more jobs.President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alternative  I is  all I was going to  say.  On  this communications  issue,I think we  also have to be careful  in terms of how  we communicate.  We use shorthandinternally,  but the public  has the confused impression  that we can affect inflation  or we canaffect growth.  So, we need  to talk about inflation in the context  of how it prevents  the use of realresources in  a way that  fosters maximum efficiency  and maximum  growth.  We  all understandthat, but it involves  a certain  subtlety.  We certainly  do not want to  put ourselves  in the positionof having  the public think we can directly deliver growth when it is real factors that do that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I say "ditto"  to all the arguments  for alternative  I--keeping  thelong-run  ranges the  same.  On the issue of the role of M2, I think we have to  spend a fair amountof time talking about this among ourselves.  It is not  an easy discussion.  The  first issue iswhether  M2 will be an intermediate target or an  indicator, and there  are  various  levels withinthat.  I think we probably  ought to get  started discussing  that among ourselves.On the communications  issues, we can do  better.  I think we are doing somewhatbetter, but we can  do a lot better.  Our basic problem is  that our job requires  short-run  discipline7/1-2/97for long-run  good, and that is not an obvious  virtue,  given human nature.  I think the way to do itis to  focus on jobs and growth;  that  should be the approach.  I think that  deserves all  of ourattention,  not just in  speeches  but in one-on-one  conversations  and in informal  gatherings.  Wecan  make our case  a lot better than we  have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  I, too, Mr.  Chairman,  would prefer to stay with the current ranges.  Ithink the most important  consideration  for the moment is the signal effect,  and in  my viewraising the ranges would  risk sending  the wrong signal.  I have  some notes  from yesterday'sdiscussion  that I wanted  to work into  the conversation.  I was going to save them for the  nextgo-around, but let me just relate at this point my personal  observation  about how difficult  wefound it yesterday  to make the argument  for low inflation.  My comment  about  how  far we haveto go certainly did  not mean to imply that we  should not work as hard  as  we know  how  toachieve our  inflation objective.  I think the comments that Jerry Jordan made yesterday  and BillMcDonough  and you made this  morning about  better ways  to communicate  clearly indicate theright direction.  I  am very  supportive  of our collectively  trying to  make that case in  a better waythan we have in  the past.  I wanted  to weigh in on that as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

MR. STERN.  I, too,  would support  alternative I.  There  are ways  to  improve thisaspect of the policy process,  and I look forward  to discussing them in  future meetings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I, too, would  go along with  alternative I, but I think we  should not do itjust to kick  a difficult decision  down the  road.  The next few months  may actually  be an  easier7/1-2/97period in  which to explain  a change in thinking  than later when  one might imagine that we maybe doing something  really unpopular at a time when the economy is not doing very well  and weare being blamed for it.  One can think of a lot worse moments  for explaining things than wehave now.The second point is that it is very easy to say that we are raising interest rates, if wehave to do that,  to sustain growth in the economy and jobs.  But that explanation  will not becredible  unless we  make the connections  clear.  This was Tom Melzer's point.  We risk havingpeople ask what we are  talking about and  totally tuning out unless we get that explanation  across.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I concur, Mr. Chairman, with alternative  I.  I don't think I can  addanything to the many valuable comments  that have been made around  the table.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We have  had a  fairly thorough discussion.  Before weget to a vote, there is a minor question  about an adjective  in the directive, the word  "monitoring."Don Kohn,  would you explain that issue?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  It has  struck us in recent Humphrey-Hawkins  write-ups that putting theword  "monitoring"  in  front of debt makes it sound as if that aggregate  has  a quality to it thatdiffers  from the Committee's  use of the monetary  aggregates.  I think the  existing practiceevolved  when the monetary  aggregates  really were more indicators  or targets,  somewhere  in that7/1-2/97nexus,  while debt was  never intended  to be  a target  and was on trial as an  indicator.  TheCommittee decided  to call it a "monitoring"  range  so that people  would not expect  any action bythe Committee if the  actual  behavior of debt fell outside the range.  However,  it has struck us  thatno one  should expect  action just because one of the monetary  aggregates  is breaching  its range,and in  fact the ranges  for monetary  growth  are not even set with that in mind.  So, thedifferentiation  is awkward.  The question before  the Committee is whether  we can  drop the word"monitoring"  in front of the  word "debt"  since in effect all the ranges  are  "monitoring"  ranges.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Unless  someone expresses  an objection,  I presume  thatwould be appropriate.  It  will be fascinating  to see if anyone  notices the deletion.  [Laughter]Would you now read the  version  reflecting  alternative I?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The  wording for the  paragraph  on the long-run  ranges is on page 29of the Bluebook.  It starts  off with the usual general  policy statement:  "The  Federal  Openpromote  sustainable  growth in output.  In furtherance  of these objectives,  the Committeereaffirmed  at this meeting  the ranges  it had established  in February for growth of M2  and M3  of1 to 5 percent  and 2 to 6 percent  respectively, measured  from the  fourth quarter  of 1996 to thefourth quarter of  1997."  Then,  skipping to the  very bottom of the page:  "The  range  for growthof total domestic  nonfinancial  debt was maintained  at 3 to 7 percent.  For  1998,  the Committeeagreed  on tentative ranges  for monetary  growth, measured  from the  fourth quarter of 1997 to thefourth quarter  of 1998,  of 1 to 5  percent  for M2  and  2 to 6 percent for M3.  The Committeeprovisionally  set the associated  range for growth  of total domestic  nonfinancial  debt at  3  to 7percent for 1998.  The behavior of the monetary aggregates  will continue to be evaluated  in the7/1-2/97light of progress toward  price level  stability, movements  in their velocities,  and  developments  inthe economy  and financial  markets."

I will talk a bit about how the  results  of those  exercises  might or might not relate  tothe current situation  and finish with some comments  on proposed  changes in the wording of theoperational paragraph  that  are  shown in the Bluebook.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Well,  I assume  there  are no questions!  [Laughter]President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Don, I think the exercise you  did on the various  policy rules  is quiteuseful,  and you  and your colleagues are  to be  complimented  for helping guide  us through  thisusing that  approach.  As  you quite properly point out, however,  the Achilles  heel  of this  isuncertainty.  We  do not know  the underlying  structure  of the economy  with a high degree  ofcertainty;  at  least there  are  different views  about it.  There  is also uncertainty,  often in real time,7/1-2/97about whether  we are dealing  with a supply shock or a demand  shock.  What happensanalytically to this  approach if one relaxes the rather Herculean  assumption of certainty and  sayswe really  do not have a high level  of understanding  of the underlying  structure and there isuncertainty  about whether  there are  demand or supply shocks?  Is  there an analytical  way  to dealwith that or do you just end up  with something that is not very definitive?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think "both" is the answer.  The models  actually  do not have  todifferentiate  as such between  supply and demand  shocks. In effect they do, but it  should benoted that  they are just reacting to output gaps and to  inflation  gaps.  From the perspective  of therule, the ruler, I guess, does  not have to say this is  a supply shock or this  is a demand  shock.Having said that,  I would  like to mention  that certain  rules work better for demand  shocks andother rules work better for supply shocks,  as the other paper that was circulated pointed  out moreclearly.  So, if you have some clue  as to whether you are  dealing with a supply shock or ademand  shock when making  policy, you would want to use that information to shape  your policyresponse instead  of adhering  rigidly to  a particular rule.  In theory,  you do not have  to know whattype of shock it is, but you could make policy better if you did know.Concerning  the problem  of uncertainty  about the structure  of the  economy, this is areally  complex subject that President McDonough  brought  up at the last meeting,  and it is onethat I must admit I have not sorted out to  my own satisfaction.  As he pointed out, there is anolder literature  starting with Bill Brainard that  says, if there is multiplier uncertainty--if  you arenot sure  of the connection  between  a policy  action  and the response  in the  economy--that  oughtto induce  some caution.  If you  are not sure what will happen,  you  go part of the way there,  see7/1-2/97how it works out, and go  a little further.  The so-called  Brainard uncertainty  should induce  amuch more cautious  response  than you would  get  from the Henderson-McKibbin  strategy.On  the other hand,  people have done other exercises  in which the coefficients  areknown, the slopes  of the  lines are  known, but their position  is uncertain.  For example, we  maybe uncertain  about the position  of the  NAIRU but quite sure  that we know what the slope of theshort-run tradeoff is.  Those kinds  of uncertainties  do not necessarily  engender  sluggishpolicymaking.  You would proceed  on the basis of your best guess with that kind of uncertainty,see what happens, and adjust later.  So, there  are different  kinds  of uncertainty.The real  world clearly is much more complex.  Various uncertainties  interact.  Youobserve things happening;  you do not know  whether a multiplier effect  is involved.  Things  arenot happening  the way  you expected;  you do not  know whether the reaction of the economy  haschanged or the whole position  of some function has changed.  And you  do not know what causedthe change,  whether  it is a supply or a demand  shock.  While I do think uncertainty  counselscaution in policymaking,  I would get a little concerned  if it counseled paralysis.  The other partof the  lesson is that when you  see an output gap opening  up, if that is  your best guess,  you haveto do something  at some  point or the pressures producing  that gap  will mount and you will  havea worse  problem later.  My concern  about cautious policymaking  is that it can get so cautiousthat problems build.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I am going to refer  to chart 4 following page  12  in the Bluebook.  Iwould like to get Don and  perhaps you also, Mr.  Chairman, to comment on  an observation  that Iam going to make.  I believe it is true  that if each  of us were  polled individually  and  asked if we7/1-2/97believe in  the Phillips curve tradeoff, we would give an answer  along the  lines that thereprobably  is none  in the long run.  We would say that there are  various inflation  rates consistentwith a given unemployment rate  in the long run and vice versa.  But we probably would believethere is a shorter-run  tradeoff.  Comparing  the top panel and the bottom panel of chart 4,  it seemsthere is a very strong Phillips curve  built in that lasts  for years and  years.  There  are a lot ofallusions  to the tradeoff in the Bluebook that seem to indicate  a strong  belief in a long-termPhillips curve.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  No, there is no long-term Phillips curve  built into this.  I think you haveto be a little careful,  President McTeer,  about the scale  of these charts.  We are talking  aboutsmall declines  in inflation  and  fairly small output gaps.  The sacrifice ratio built in is  3 over avery  long run.  That is consistent with many, many modeling exercises.  The  sacrifice ratio weused in the first set of simulations,  2 over a period  of 5  years, is also  consistent with a lot ofmodeling and  empirical work done  over a quite long period.  So,  there is a short-run Phillipscurve built in  here.  We do not have  a persistent supply shock that allows  us to  get a  free lunch inthe form of lower inflation  without giving up something in  terms of output.  These aresymmetrical shocks  around zero,  so  there are as many positive as negative  ones.  In order to getinflation down,  you have  to give up some  output in these kinds of exercises.  The only way  youcould get  around that is illustrated  in chart 3.  If in fact you have  a positive and persistent supplyshock and the NAIRU is lower than you thought it was,  then you have the  type of favorabletradeoff that Dave Stockton  talked about  yesterday  in another variant.  But in the stochasticsimulations, the shocks  are all temporary.  They average  to zero over time, and  so the short-runPhillips curve  dictates that you need to give up some  output to get inflation  down on average7/1-2/97over this time period.  Again, there  is no  long-run Phillips curve  built in  here.  In fact,  there's anegative relationship between  output and  inflation,  as  I tried to point out,  but no positive  one.That  is, the model does not produce  any  gain in  efficiency and output from having lowerinflation,  though we think there really are some  gains.

[SECTION]

MR.  MCTEER.  I guess  I was struck more by the horizontal  axis than the vertical axis.There  seem to be a lot of years  there.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  The implied sacrifice ratios  are in line with what we  have been using forquite  a while.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I think that the model reflects the  importance  of price  expectations inthis process in a very simple way.  That  is why we  do not have  the long-run  tradeoff.  Ifexpectations  change  gradually over time, we are  going  to have  short-run tradeoffs.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  There's a sentence on page  6 of the  Bluebook that says:  "In the staffmodel, the  sacrifice  ratio over five years  is about  2; that  is,  a 1 percentage  point reduction  ininflation can be achieved  only by pushing  the unemployment  rate above  the NAIRU  by theequivalent  of about 2 percentage  points for one  year."  At the end of 1996, in December, the  CPIinflation rate  was 3.3  percent,  and I think the latest reading is 2.2 percent.  It has  come down  thenon that trailing basis more than a full  percentage  point at a time when  the unemployment rate  hascome  down by half a dozen notches.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  I think  we have  been facing  a situation  in which there have been  somevery favorable  supply developments,  and that means we have not had this short-run  tradeoff.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The tradeoff  is there in a sense, but it is obscured by the big drop in oilprices.  That has shifted the short-run  Phillips curve.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I am  going to  address this issue in  a somewhat differentform.  The basic  problem is that the  model has a whole  series of consecutive  short-term  Phillipscurves, and  its structure  does not  change.  If you accept  that hypothesis about  the short-termstructure  and you continuously  work with no change  in that structure,  then the results  shown hereare mathematically  inevitable.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Life is a series  of short  terms.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is what the short-term  Phillips curve is.  We seethis correlation  historically.  The  trouble is that it veers off periodically,  and that creates  thenonexistence  of a  long-term Phillips curve.  We  are now in the  veer stage!  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Don, I believe you provided  a useful framework  for thinking aboutdemand  side/supply  side.  The need to think about that is unavoidable.  We do that implicitly.So, why not do  it explicitly?  It is very helpful to  be forced  into that  framework as we  think aboutwhat is going on  and the policy regime  with which we  respond.  You say that the model does notreally  care whether  it is dealing  with a supply-side  or a demand-side  shock;  it responds  to outputand inflation gaps.  Of course, as  policymakers  we have  to care.  It is important for us to  try toevaluate  a shock when it occurs even  if we  cannot be sure of what we mean  by demand  side andsupply side.  I think I know what you mean.  Over the last 30 years,  we were comfortable inthinking of the oil events  of 1974  as a negative  supply shock or those in  1986  as a favorablesupply shock.  But there are  a lot of other events that shock the  economic  system such  asinternational  developments:  certainly  Suez, the Bay  of Pigs, and Kuwait come to  mind.  Therealso are  domestic events  like the  Crash of 1929, Nixon's  price controls,  and things  like that.7/1-2/97I do not know  whether you  call them supply  side,  demand  side,  or what, but we mightwant to react  differently  in a policy  sense depending  upon which  of those  we think it is--thenature  of the events.  There  is a potential interdependence  based  on  the monetary policy regimethat I think we have  to be very careful  about.  It  does  get back  to this  question  of when we maywant to exercise caution  in the Brainard  sense or the  Bill Poole sense  or when  we  should worryabout paralysis.  I suspect--this  is only a  guess at  this point--that  to the extent  we are confidentthat we are  dealing only  with a demand-side  development,  we  would lean in the direction ofcaution.  To  the  extent we believe  we are  dealing  with what  starts  as a supply-side  event--it maybe an asset market  development--then  we need to resist paralysis.  The reason  for that is thefollowing:  We may have  a series of developments  that one might  characterize  as being afavorable  supply-side  shock  such as  the recent  increase  in productivity--where  people  perceivethat the real  rate of return  on productive capital  is rising  for a whole host of reasons.  The reasonwe worry about  a pegged  nominal interest  rate  approach to  policy is that the market  dynamics  ofpeople  reacting  to the perception  of rising real returns  and increasing wealth raise the opportunitycosts  of holding central bank money.  If we  have a derived  demand  for central  bank money,  apegged  nominal  interest rate policy would  cause us to expand central bank money.  This wouldunintentionally  convert  a  favorable  supply-side  shock into  a demand  shock.  We would want tobe a little more activist to avoid  converting  a favorable  supply  shock  or a negative supply  shock,say the Kuwait War, into an  adverse demand  shock.  That is what I mean by  the interdependencybetween  the two.Sometimes  we talk  about those in terms of what  has happened  to the natural  rate ofinterest  or something  similar.  We can  translate these  things into the kind of framework  that we7/1-2/97are talking  about here.  I think the  analysis  of whether  we can convert one  kind of shock into theother type of a shock, intentionally  or not, needs  to be  fleshed out a little more to  enable  us toguard against  an inadvertent  outcome.  That  is just a comment  and if you want to react to that, Iwould be glad to  hear your thoughts because  I don't feel  that I have  thought it through ascarefully  as  I need  to.On  your alternative  wording  for the operational paragraph  of the  directive,  I likegetting rid of the "woulds"  and  "mights"  and all that.  However, I really  do not want to  introducethe  words "tighten"  and "ease"  into the directive even  though it is  clear that the  language refersto tightening  and easing conditions  in reserve markets.  What we  are  talking about is expandingor contracting  central bank money.  We  all know that if we have  a supply-side  event, or possiblya demand-side  event but I have not thought about that enough,  we can in effect  tighten or easemoney market conditions or reserve  conditions with an unchanged  fed funds  rate.  Conditions inreserve  markets can tighten  or ease if we fail  to change the  nominal funds  rate based on thederived demand  for central bank money as modified  by external  shocks.  The proposed  directivelanguage  would imply that only our actions  cause reserve conditions  to  tighten or ease,  and weknow that is not true.  It is failing to change the funds  rate that would cause them to tightenunintentionally  or ease unintentionally,  and we  often are trying to guard  against that.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I don't think  I have  a lot to  add to what you  said, President  Jordan.  Youindicated that  you might not react as strongly  to demand  shocks  as to supply  shocks, and Iwonder about  that.  If you really thought that demand  had shifted up in the  first half of this  year,starting from  a position in which the economy was  close to potential  and was  now going pastpotential,  you would want to react rather  strongly to that.  On the  supply shocks,  I agree  with7/1-2/97what you said in the following  sense:  I  think they  are very  difficult to analyze.  I  thought DaveStockton  in his briefing  yesterday  gave  a very  good example  of the kind of supply  shock youwere  discussing.  In that example  the equilibrium  real  funds  rate rose  because there  was  anincrease  in productivity  in the economy, and  at some point the Fed would  have  to tighten  toavoid the overshooting  in  demand that you were  talking  about.  There could be  other kinds  ofsupply shocks.  I think, for example,  that a NAIRU  shock  has a different  flavor to it.  So,  supplyshocks do require  differentiating  to see whether they require  or will eventually require raising orlowering  interest rates  to equilibrate  supply and  demand in the economy.  It  is not alwaysobvious  which  way that is  going to  go and how the tradeoffs  will  go.  Supply-side  shocks  aremore  difficult to analyze  because  they come in different  varieties.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I want to  respond to your point about the demand-side  shock late lastyear  and early  this  year.  That  was a case where I became  increasingly concerned  that what  wasreally  going on  related fundamentally  to the  supply  side, and we  were inadvertently  converting  itinto a demand-side  shock by  holding the  nominal funds rate  steady.  We were unintentionallycreating more demand,  but the initial impetus came  from the  favorable supply-side  surprises.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  I found the simulations  on chart 4  of the  Bluebook extremelyinteresting.  I would like to ask a question  about the opportunistic  approach to monetary policy inthat chart.  I am sure that in a situation  where  you have  an  adverse  supply shock or  a positivedemand  shock that  causes a rise  in the forecast of inflation,  there is  a very aggressive  reaction  interms of the opportunistic  rule.  If one were  to adjust that reaction to reflect  more realisticallythat policymakers  might not have  a symmetric  objective function  in terms  of their willingness  to7/1-2/97raise or lower interest  rates, it seems  to me that we  could conceivably  see the  opportunism  lineon the chart reach  the long-run  inflation  objective even beyond  the year  2030.  When  it looks asthough the model is forecasting increasing  interest rates,  I think it is almost human nature tobegin to question  the forecast.  That may  apply to  all  the policy strategy  alternatives, but I thinkit is more  explicit in the opportunistic  alternative.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  If you turn  back to page  10,  you can see that in both the target zone andthe  opportunism  simulations  we had  a strong  reaction to inflation  outside the  target zone  oroutside  the zone of indifference  for opportunism.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  That's right.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  And certainly, almost by  algebra, you  are right.  If you reduced  thosecoefficients  on inflation  outside the zone from 2.5  to  1.5,  then you would  get a less  strongreaction,  and it would take  longer to get to price stability.  On the  other hand,  I think  we have  tobe  a little careful.  Look at the Henderson-McKibbin  deliberate  rule.  That is a case in which thepolicymaker does respond  more strongly to  output gaps than to  inflation gaps,  and it performsfairly well in terms of getting to low inflation.  If you have  a  demand shock,  of course,  there isno conflict.  The output gap  opens and that is going to raise inflation strongly in  response.  Bothare moving in the same direction.  It is with  supply  shocks that  you get conflicts.  So,  it is notnecessarily  the case that a policymaker who  puts a lot of emphasis  on output relative  to inflationwould take  a long time to get to price  stability.  The Henderson-McKibbin  policymaker takesless time  than the opportunist  and only a bit more  than the Taylor policymaker.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I am coming from  a different direction,  but I wanted to make  someof the  same comments.  I found these  simulations  very interesting even though I know thatnothing can be carried  on until the  year 2030 with any reasonable  level of reliability.  I must saythat if we  are  going to keep using this  definition of opportunism,  I would like to feel  a little morecomfortable  about what is involved  in it.  A  great deal  of good material  accompanied theBluebook,  and  it is going to take me  a while to  digest that.  I have been  reasonably sympatheticto the idea that one reacts  when inflation  goes above a boundary,  but when inflation is within  thatboundary,  one tries to  work harder  on the  output side than on the inflation  side.  I like  that as  atheoretical  construct,  but I'm not sure that the way this  is modeled is the  same  as the way I  amthinking about it.  I need  some time to assimilate that.  This discussion  was really  helpful  and thepaper was  very helpful.At the risk of being resistant  to change for the  sheer sake  of being resistant to change,I must say that I have some  sympathy  for Don's comment  about  Pandora's box  with reference  tothe proposals to change the wording  of the directive.  I was watching the  CNN financialcommentary  program from 6:00 to 7:00 a.m this morning.  The woman  who usually does theircommentary  about Fed policy observed  the Fed's policy decision  today was a "no  brainer."  Thereally  important thing was the wording  of the  directive  from the May meeting,  to be releasedtomorrow,  and  whether it would be symmetric  or asymmetric.  I thought, oh heavens!  If wechange this  directive wording, it will make a lot more  difference to people than we expect.  Wedon't necessarily want to send new messages  with this wording  change.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  But remember,  she had to think of something  to say this  morning.[Laughter]7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I  suppose.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  That change would give her six months'  worth of new material!

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes,  that's right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  At least  she said "no  brainer" rather than "no brains."

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Well,  that's my interpretation  of what  she actually  said.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It does  strike  me that we have  to  go back to the  drawingboard  on this.  My maximum likelihood estimate  is that it would take us 4 hours,  52 minutes,  and.4 seconds to get this  issue resolved  today.  We do not have  that much  time.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  To change the  wording?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.  What we ought to do is the  following:  We shouldtry to negotiate this  issue between meetings. It is too difficult  to negotiate  directly  here.  Wehave to figure  out another  way to  do it.  The reason people  interpret  this directive  differently isthat its  constructive  ambiguity  has worked.  That  is the problem.  We are all looking  at  theelephant  from different directions.  So, unless  somebody  disagrees  with what  I am saying, wewill  try that approach.  I am more than  willing to  support what is being  proposed here.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I am super more  than  willing to support it.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN  and MR. PARRY.  Me,  too.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I have some question about  how the wording  on symmetry  andasymmetry is  handled.  However, our practice  when  we set a target  for the funds  rate ofdescribing  that in  terms of reserve  conditions  seems  to me to be somewhere  betweenembarrassing  and amusing.  I think the time  has come  to make at least that change in thedirective.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  I think it could take  us many hours of discussion to decide  whether  ornot we  ought to  include a reference  to symmetry in the  directive.  But I don't understand why itwould take us four hours to make the  words  clear.  We  are merely  saying  it in English.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Why don't we do the  following.  This should  not be avote of just the  Committee members because  some  are  on the Committee and some  are notcurrently, but the  concern  is general.  Why don't we go around the room and get a quickstatement from everyone  as  to whether or not they accept the recommendation  as is, or with veryminor changes,  or they do not accept it.  We will find out very  quickly.  Why don't you start,Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I like the recommended  wording.  I think it is simpler and clearer.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  I would retain  the traditional wording  until we explain  to the publichow and why we are  changing it;  the explanation  should be  released  in advance  of the actualpublication  of the reworded  directive.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Mr. Chairman, it might be useful to ask the members  to differentiatebetween  the first sentence  and the second  sentence.  Some  may favor changing  one and not theother.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes,  I thought about that.  We ought not change oneand not the other one until we are  sure that one  is acceptable  and the other is not.  Doing this intwo steps is not a good idea.  I'm sorry, go  ahead President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I totally  agree with Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I pass.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I'm not sure any change  gets us much.  I worry a  little aboutreinforcing  this idea that  we are in a more rigid interest rate targeting regime  at the very  time weare thinking  about the possibility of some  alternative  regime,  though I know that is  a decision  forthe longer-term  future.  Secondly, I worry  a little about what  Jerry Jordan  was pointing  out.Presumably,  we could at times maintain  current conditions  in reserve  markets with an  increase  ora decrease  in the funds rate.  We would have to allow for that here,  and in the event that might  bequite  confusing to describe.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  You said it.  President Stem.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I think I agree with  Tom Melzer's  reservations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Tom is saying it is  very complex.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I would very much like  to clear up  the difficult wording, but I wouldsuggest taking the preamble portion  that applies to the second sentence  and have  it apply to bothsentences  with the alternate wording.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  I like the changes.  When  we change the federal  funds rate, we nowannounce  that following the  meeting.  So, including the rate in  the directive  does not seem to meto be much of a change. I also  like the clarity of the alternative  wording  suggested for  symmetryand  asymmetry.  The only reservation  I would have is that I think Jerry  Jordan has raised aninteresting  point.7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I would like to see  clearer language.  We might want to  negotiatewhether this is it, but I think  we definitely could use clearer language.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  I think the  suggested  rewording raises enough  issues that it's notworth the trouble  it might bring us  if we introduced  it at this time.  I would leave it alone  fornow.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  In  recent years  we have moved in the direction of transparency  andclarity in terms  of making public  what we do.  We  debated for years,  for example, whether weought to announce  our decisions  promptly.  I think  we are much better off because we nowannounce them.  We were concerned  about what would happen if we released the transcripts,  andI am not aware of any adverse  results from our doing that.  I think the  proposed  rewording  of thedirective  is just a  continuation of our movement  toward being more transparent and clear.  Onecan quibble about the words  and we  don't necessarily  have  to make the proposed  changes  today,but as  a general  matter I think it would be helpful  to continue to move in this direction.  Thereare times when one may want constructive  opaqueness,  but I am in favor  of the proposedrewording because  it points toward  more openness  and transparency.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I do not think this language  is ready for prime  time.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I like the transparency  aspect of the proposal verymuch.  However,  in the current environment  where  we do not have  a very specific  long-termgoal,  I worry about the point that Tom Melzer made.  This rewording  is going to reinforce  thefocus on the funds rate.  One other point that Tom made intrigued me, though.  If we could  atsome  future point  consider linking in that first sentence  the  notion of  "maintaining current"  with7/1-2/97an  increasing  funds rate  and explain that in  some way, that might be  a way to get  around theproblem.  But for now, I would leave  the wording  unchanged.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I view  this as  an improvement, an increase  in explicitness  andtransparency.  I don't see any reason  why only professional  Fed watchers  should understand thedirective.  I think we have  to  bring it into conformity with what we say in our announcements.  Ialso object  a little to the idea  that the new wording  is a problem because  it would tend toreinforce the  notion that we control and move  the federal funds rate.  That  is what we do!  Aslong as  that is what we do, that is what we  should say we do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I am a bit more comfortable  with the proposed first  sentence  because,as Larry Meyer said, that is what we  do.  That is  what we have been focusing on, and I think  weshould update that directive sentence.  I must say with respect  to the symmetry  sentence  that Iworry about substituting one  archaic expression for another.  I also feel that every time we votefor a given  symmetry, it is  for a different  reason.  When we vote for  a particular symmetry at onemeeting,  it does  not mean the same thing  as it does another time.  So, I am not sure that whateverchange we make  in the wording of that sentence  is going to help much.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chair.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I think the proposed first sentence  merely  saysin the directive  what we already  say in the press release,  so I cannot  see  any reason why onewould not wish to adopt that rewording.  In the current  second sentence,  I find the  "woulds"  and"mights"  to be embarrassing nonsense.  I think that wording is the ultimate  in obfuscation  and7/1-2/97truly  silly.  Therefore,  anything that  is understandable  English has  to be  an improvement,  and  Ifind the proposed language  to be just that.  So, I  am happy  with the proposal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  During the  intermeeting  period, why don't we  try tofind a  mechanism to communicate  our views on this question  and bring perhaps  two or threealternatives  to the next meeting, with some  sense of where everyone  stands.  In other words,  letus not just throw the issue  on the table.  We could then have a discussion  in which hopefully wewill reach  some consensus.  The  issue is rather tricky and we may end up agreeing,  for example,on the first sentence  and not on the  second.  Maybe we can find a  choice  of words  that peoplewill  support.With respect to the issue  of locking in the funds rate,  I am not terribly concerned  aboutthat because if we do move  away from the funds rate, we will change  the language.  I think thelanguage  should reflect  what we  are doing, but I do not see why the new wording  in itself shouldbe seen  as reinforcing  our focus on the funds rate  any more than the  current  wording does.  Icannot see how it does that, provided  that we in the  Committee recognize  that this rewording  ismerely an endeavor  to describe how we operate under the  current regime.  It does not prejudgehow or when we might improve  the  current regime  and employ new  language  in the  directive todescribe  it.  If you  go back  and read some of the very early directives, they do  not look anythinglike  the current directives.  The  Committee has changed the wording  of the directive  innumerabletimes.  The directive  is not a constitution; it is more like a statute  and not a terribly good one.Why don't we break for coffee?[Coffee break]7/1-2/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Are there  any other questions  for Don?  If not, let  mestart  off and go to the directive  specifically.  As  you may remember, I indicated a hope  at our lastmeeting that we would  have a credible basis for tightening  today on the grounds  that the balanceof risks that I  saw at that  time, which are  not materially  different today, suggested  that a  verygradual rise  in the  federal  funds rate would be consistent  with what we knew and  what we  didnot know.  In my view  that was  the likely policy outcome,  given our incomplete knowledge  atthat time.  However, it has become  quite obvious in  the last several  weeks that  the data do not yetmake a  credible case  for tightening.  I suspect that  such  a case will emerge  by the time of theeconomy.  I do  not know if the word  "fundamental"  is the appropriate  term to describe  it, but weare observing  something that is different  from what we have experienced  over the years,  and it isincreasingly  difficult to  argue that we  are dealing only with statistical noise  or minor aberrationsin our model of the functioning of the  economy.The  most important  policy consideration,  however, is whether  policy inaction  atthis time would put us behind the  curve.  What  is reassuring is that we  are  hard pressed to findany evidence  of rising inflationary  pressures  in the data, whether  we are  looking,  for example, atthe  pipeline numbers  or at the wage structure.  Wherever  we look, we  are getting  little, if any,evidence of mounting inflationary pressures,  and  that has to raise  some questions  about how weview  the economy  at large.  I recently  glanced through  the Beigebook of about  18  months ago,and it seemed to me  that I could take its  cover off and replace  it with the cover for the latestBeigebook.  That may seem a bit shallow  analytically,  but if we think  about it, this is telling ussomething quite important.7/1-2/97It is hard  at this stage to look at the errors  produced by our equations andconclude  that they reflect  the usual statistical  noise.  The  evidence no longer  suggests  in myopinion that that is  a credible  view.  We tend to construct, in  either a formal  or a less formalmanner,  some  econometric  structure that  reflects the way we think the economy works.  We tryto fit that structure  to the  available  data and  derive  specific fixed  parameters.  To the extent thathistory is a useful  guide to the current  structure, we will get parameters  that do not show  anydrift.  If we use that model,  we presumably  will come up with a forecast  that is truly replicatingthe dynamic  forces in our economy at this stage.The interesting  specification  in virtually  all such models  is that, under currentconditions,  prices  go up if any element  of a Phillips curve tradeoff or some other set ofrelationships  incorporating  tight labor and tight product markets  is involved.  If we lock in thoseparameters  and run a simulation,  given the present  level of labor market tightness,  any historicaldata will engender  an immediate acceleration  in inflation.  Yet, what is happening  currently inthe real  world clearly is something  other than that.  The reason I think we have to be exceedinglycareful is that  as we go  around this table and  listen to the descriptions  of very tight markets,which  are unquestionably there,  the usual  implication  is that such markets  of necessity  lead to anacceleration  in wages  and prices.  Implicit in that translation  from tight markets  to expected wageand price  acceleration  is that the parameters  in question are  still valid and that their signs  arecorrect.  The reason we  are not getting the predicted  results is that something fundamental  ishappening that  is not reflected in the structure  of our models.  Our problem  at this stage is that itis much too early  to say what the full force of those changing parameters  may be or how long itwill take for them to exert their effects.  I'm not saying that the explanation  I have  given is the7/1-2/97only one  that will  stand up, but it is clear that our existing  models do not account  for what hasbeen  happening.  They do not, in any configuration  of which I am  aware,  explain what has beenhappening to the price level as  the  unemployment rate has  fallen.  However, if we  compare  theforecast  in the previous  Greenbook to that in the current Greenbook,  it is obvious  thatappropriate  adjustments  are being made in the model to capture  certain ongoing  developments.I think there is  a series of simple relationships  that in fact might explain  all that isgoing  on.  The issue  is whether the  developments  underlying  these  explanations  are sustainable.I refer to the  notion, not dissimilar to the  argument that Paul David of Stanford was  making backin  1989, that fundamental  technological changes  that occur once  every 50  or  100 years  canexplain what is happening.  Whether in  fact that is  a viable  explanation  is the open question.  AsI have argued before,  I think that the uncertainty  associated with the rapid  introduction of newtechnology  has created  insecurity.  Until  1995,  we observed  that changes in  wages  tended to fallwell below what any  of our equations would have predicted.  Since then, the one-year  changesprobably have been  in line with the short-term  Phillips curve,  but they have not retraced  theshortfalls  that occurred in  1993,  1994, and  1995.  This is suggesting  that the more recentacceleration  in wage increases  is  fitting into a  short-term Phillips curve model.  It does not in anyway restore the  wage levels that we would have  expected had we been  projecting them four orfive years ago.The actual  accounting  explanation  of what is going on is the one  that I mentioned  atthe last meeting, namely that the  increase  in unit costs in the  nonfinancial  corporate  area hasslowed to virtually zero for all practical  purposes.  This largely results  from a limited rise in unitlabor costs of only about  1 percent  at an  annual rate.  This  outcome can  be separated  into factors7/1-2/97relating  to the  impact of technology.  First, the  uncertainties  stemming from the  rapidintroduction  of technology  are engendering  a considerable  amount of fear that has  induced lowerwage gains  as  a tradeoff for increased job security.  It is  very difficult not to  acknowledge  thatthat is happening  in  some form or other.  One cannot  argue, as far as I can see,  that becausepeople  are  saying that jobs are more plentiful  and they  are more confident  about the job market,it therefore  follows that they have significantly  less job insecurity.  People can be totally insecureabout their own jobs and still  say, "I can get  another one, but I am not sure how much  it willpay."  Uncertainty  is essentially  an irrational  phenomenon,  and the phenomenon  of divergingviews is nothing new  in the world.  Unless we can explain why wages  are being  held downbelow historically  predicted  levels for other reasons,  I find technology-induced  uncertainty themost credible explanation,  although I grant you it is by no means  a necessary  explanation of thatphenomenon.The issue of profitability is, however,  the crucial  question because it involves  acombination  of subdued wages  and a stronger rise in productivity  than one would expect  at thislate stage in  the business  cycle.  It is true that we can  explain  a goodly part of this productivityincrease  by the acceleration in economic  activity, but the latter too is very tough to explain at thislate stage in  the business  expansion.  I think we will have a very important  test in the upcomingperiod.  If productivity  is indeed accelerating  in a cyclically-adjusted  sense, we should see  itreflected in  the second-quarter data.  This is because  economic  growth  has come down verydramatically in the second quarter from the rate of the previous  six months.  To be sure,productivity accelerated  in the fourth  and the first quarters.  However,  one can  argue that that isnothing  more than a reflection  of accelerating  output.  But if productivity  growth held up in the7/1-2/97second quarter,  something different  is happening.  We  obviously do not have  much  data for thesecond quarter,  but we  do have  some evidence  suggesting that profit margins  were not undersevere  stress in that quarter.  If we look at unit labor costs, prices,  and the like in themanufacturing sector, we  get very little evidence  of rising inflation, maybe  some  shade of ain  fact it turns out to have  remained strong,  the only explanation  is that unit labor costs  have  notaccelerated.  Since we know roughly how wages and  salaries per hour are  tracking,  this suggeststhat productivity  growth is not easing significantly in  the  second quarter.  Indeed, themanufacturing  data through April  and May  show an insignificant  decline  in unit labor costs, forwhatever that is worth.  If this is in fact the case,  it explains  what  is happening. It does notexplain how long the process will continue, but it does tell  us that  a different structure  iscurrently  exerting  an impact on the markets.Having  said all  that, we are still  confronted  with certain  undeniable facts,  namely thatemployers  are digging  into the bottom of the barrel  for workers.  We are experiencing  demandgrowth  at this stage that probably requires  roughly one million additional  workers  at an  annualrate in excess of what can be sustained with the normal  growth in the population.  There areroughly  six  million people  outside the labor  force  who say they would like  a job if they could getone.  They are not seeking one  and therefore  they are not in the  unemployment pool.  I am sorry;I think I just misspoke.  I said six  million were  seeking jobs, and I think that number is wrong.What is the figure?  [Pause]  I take it back;  it is 5.9 million. [Laughter] In  any event, weobviously  still have room  in the economy, but we have  a lot less than previously.  The level ofeconomic  activity is  getting to a point where something has to give.  While one may argue that at7/1-2/97this stage  we  are not seeing  any evidence  in the product markets  that we  are running  intosignificant difficulties,  clearly if we run out of labor  at some point, capital  basically  will not helpno matter how much we may have.  Therefore,  the inflation risks certainly  remain on  the upside,although there  is no urgency  for a particularly aggressive  move as  yet.Superimposed  on  all this  is quite startling  evidence  of how much  of the growth  in theGDP, how much of the  growth in productivity,  and how much  of the increase  in profit margins  isconfined  to a very  small segment  of the economy, the high-tech  area representing  roughly 3percent of the economy.  That sector of the  economy has  accounted  for one-third of the totaleconomic  growth--maybe  slightly less depending  on what indicators  one looks at.  It accounts  fora very significant part of the increase  in profit margins  and productivity  gains that we areexperiencing.  The significance  of this bimodal distribution is  as yet unclear.  We always havethis phenomenon  to one extent  or another, but it is particularly  pronounced  in this period.  As Imentioned at the last meeting, the  acceleration  in capital  investment by high-tech  industriesstarting in  1993  and continuing  at a  very  substantial  pace until now is an  indication  that they seesignificantly improved  productivity  growth from the  synergies of the various  new technologies.This is the reason why I think an alert, so to speak,  on watching the productivity numbers  is veryimportant to give us a  heads-up on policy.At the moment, as I said before,  I think we have the  luxury of waiting to see how  allthis proceeds.  I do not think we  have the luxury of relaxing  our vigilance  because  it may turn outthat the productivity gains  we have seen  in the last  six months are  strictly a reflection of fastereconomic growth that  is temporary for any  number of reasons.  We may  not fall behind the curvevery quickly, but clearly we could find ourselves  behind the  curve if we waited too long.  I think7/1-2/97the demand  elements  in the  economy  are essentially quite strong.  The Greenbook is probablyright regarding  acceleration  in the  third and fourth quarters.  It is hard  to believe that  we willsustain the degree of sluggishness  we have seen  in the  first part of the  second quarter.Nonetheless,  the data indicate  that motor  vehicle sales are  poor.  We  are not seeing, except  incertain  areas,  a big rise in retail  sales  in June.  I would be  surprised if we did not get that,  and  Ithink  the producers  of the Greenbook  would be  more surprised.  I think that is the best forecastthat we can make at this  stage.I have been in a rambling mode  today because  I think it is appropriate  to the levels ofconfusion that  I sense.  In the  circumstances,  I believe the wisest thing we can do  today is toadopt  "B"  asymmetric  and  continue to  monitor the outlook.  If we begin to see  signs of a pickupin demand  that threatens  to exceed  the available  supply of workers,  I think we will have nochoice but to start to move.  For the moment  I believe we have the luxury of standing pat.Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman,  I agree  with your policy recommendation  for today.  Iwant to spend a few minutes  talking about  policy in a somewhat  longer-range  perspective.  Ithink our semiannual  two-day pre-Humphrey-Hawkins  meetings  give us the  opportunity  to takethat broader perspective  on monetary policy.  To take advantage  of that, I want  to talk about  thepolicy that I think would be appropriate  over the remainder of the  year.  This in no way binds mewith respect to future policy decisions,  as  my prescription  will always  respond to unexpecteddevelopments  in the data and associated  changes  in my forecast.Based  on my current  assessment  of the outlook, which is  very similar to  that of theGreenbook  in terms  of the path for the unemployment rate--growth  is well  above trend in thesecond half of the  year and the unemployment rate declines  further--I believe that we should planto raise  the funds rate by 50 basis  points  over the remainder of the  year in two  25 basis pointincrements, one  in August or September  and  the other in November  or December.  I would, ineffect,  be pushing forward to the  second half of 1997  the increases  in the second half of 1998that are incorporated  in the Greenbook forecast.  I think such a path would put us in  a betterposition to limit the increase  in inflation projected over  1998  and  especially  into  1999 as well asreduce  the risk of a still  sharper increase  in inflation than is projected in the Greenbook.  I mightalso note that the environment  in the  second half, at least  as projected,  provides an unusually7/1-2/97good opportunity  for tightening:  above-trend growth,  a falling  unemployment  rate, risinglong-term interest rates,  and  building expectations  of Fed action.  That  same window  ofopportunity  will not  be so  evident when  the  economy slows  to trend  in  1998.I view this  recommendation  as consistent  with the long-run  simulations presented  inthe Bluebook.  The most important conclusion  that  I reach from those  simulations is that, evengiven  the very  optimistic  assessment  of the  inflation outlook in the  base forecast,  monetarypolicy needs  to tilt toward  greater restraint  to prevent  an increase  in  consumer price inflationover time  to above  3  percent.  The  second  conclusion, perhaps  more implicit  than explicit, is thatputting some restraint  in place  in the near term enhances  the prospect  that any required  restraintwill  be modest,  will  be imposed  gradually,  and can be done without threatening  a recession.  Ithink the  simulations with alternative  policy rules  reinforce  this recommendation.  They establishthat  any of those  rules would have  yielded  an improved tradeoff between  inflation  and outputvariability compared  to actual  policy over the  historical period.  One reason  for this  is that theyrequire  aggressive moves  in the  federal  funds rate  in response  to changes in  inflation to  insurethat inflation  does  not lower the real federal  funds rate.  The Greenbook  follows  this pattern byassuming  a rise in the  nominal  funds rate  in  1998  to prevent the higher  inflation  from loweringthe  real funds rate.  Another reason  these rules are  successful  is that they all insure systematicresponses  of the real  funds  rate to evolving  economic conditions.  This is consistent  with myview  that increased flexibility  in the response of interest  rates to changing economic  conditionsmight contribute  to a better macroeconomic  performance.7/1-2/97I interpreted  our decision  to hold policy  steady  at the last meeting  as reflecting  a desireto move  gradually  and to postpone further tightening  until there was clearer evidence  of arebound  in demand  following the  slowdown in  the  second quarter.  The data since  the lastmeeting  do not yet clearly signal that that expected rebound  is under way.  I am, therefore,comfortable  with the recommendation  of no change.  I also  think in light of the balance  of risksin the  outlook that  an asymmetric  directive  is appropriate.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  although  a clear implication  of both our forecast  andthat of the Greenbook  is that we  will have  to tighten policy soon, I  am willing  to supportBluebook  alternative B  and asymmetric  language.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Our basic dilemma  is that the real world  is operating  differently fromwhat our preconceived  notions  would suggest.  We do not know if this divergence  between  ourmodels and actual  experience  is temporary  or permanent.  At a minimum, this situation  suggestscaution and a wait-and-see  attitude.  At this point, I think "B"  asymmetric  captures  that posturenicely and  I support it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  I also support no  change,  alternative B.  I have  a reasonably  strongpreference  for an  asymmetrical  directive on the basis of either of two  interpretations  peoplemight put on it.  First, although I am not sure we have fully corrected  for  our past tendency  tooverestimate  inflation, I certainly don't know any more  than anyone else  how to take  account ofsome of the  fundamental  changes  that are taking place.  My best guess is that we are  likely to7/1-2/97face  a situation that we will decide  is unsustainable  and we will  tighten.  Second, we  do notcirculate  our individual  assumptions  about policy  for the Humphrey-Hawkins  submissions,  but Iwant to confess  that my  own  submission was based on the  assumption  that we will  in fact  decidethat we are  experiencing  unsustainable  rates of economic  growth.  Accordingly,  I have  built intomy submission  some moderate  tightening  over the period ahead.  I also  would be comfortable  ifothers  want to interpret  our asymmetrical  directive as  a commitment  and resolve to hold  the lineon inflation.  So, either  of those  interpretations  of an  asymmetrical  directive  would be just finewith me.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR.  HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I can  accept your proposal  today with no  difficulty.However,  I do want to  make a couple of comments. I will  preface them by  observing  that Iunderstand the  complexity  of the issue that was  raised in  our discussion  over the last couple ofdays  and illustrated  by  the models in the  Bluebook.  But I also must confess  that I am a person  ofthe price  stability  faith.  With that in mind,  I think it is interesting  that as  output hasstrengthened,  inflation  has declined.  Though there  are  difficulties  involved in explaining  that, asyou have pointed  out, Mr.  Chairman, it is a fact that we have  seen an improvement  in outputeven  as inflation  has fallen  from modest  levels  to more  modest levels.  We need to keep  that inmind.  I also believe, however,  that we  are  not yet  at price stability.  So  I have  to wonder  if somesmall increase  in the  federal  funds rate might not be wise.  I see the  desirability of sometightening  not just as  an insurance  policy against  increasing  inflation but as a  further step towardprice  stability  where the  tradeoffs between recession  and inflation  are less  dangerous  in myopinion.  We may have  an opportunity here,  if not now then  at  some time in  the near  future, to7/1-2/97move  toward price  stability  if we do it carefully.  In my view, that  is one  of the  objectives  inaddition  to  preventing higher inflation  that we should consider  as we contemplate  policy in thefuture.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stem.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I too  support  your recommendationessentially because  I agree  with you  that we do not have  a credible basis  for tightening  at thispoint.Let me comment  on your description of the situation in which we find ourselves.  Iagree  with that description,  but I am not  sure that it is as much a departure  from past experienceas you  suggest.  The reason  for my view  is illustrated by a chart of the  relationship  betweenunemployment  and  inflation going back  over a long period of years.  This is perhaps  not the mostrigorous way  to go at it, but I find it a useful  way to start the analysis.  Several  things pop out aswe look at that chart.  First, the relationship between  unemployment  and inflation is nonlinear.Secondly,  if there is  a NAIRU,  it bounces around  a lot.  Thirdly,  there is a variable  lag betweenwhen low unemployment is achieved  and when inflation  accelerates  noticeably.  Because  wehave  had the benefit  of analyzing  this relationship  over a number of years,  we may find our viewof its history  to be simpler  today than  it was earlier.  Now,  there obviously  are  several  caveatsabout  getting into the  analysis in this way.  One,  of course,  is that the history of this relationshipwas predicated  on policy at  the time,  and I am not  analyzing it with contemporaneous  data and  soforth.  But I think the chart  is instructive because it suggests that the kinds of discussions  and thekinds of uncertainty that  we are  facing today do not differ  greatly from past experience.7/1-2/97Where  that leads  me,  at least tentatively,  is that I think the risks remain  in the direction  of anacceleration  of inflation,  and I worry that we may be  ill prepared  to address  it properly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  I am in agreement  with your proposal  because  Ithink, as President Stern  mentioned,  that we probably do need a greater  element of credibility intaking action  than we have  right now.  But I do want to sound  a couple of notes of caution  and topick up on a couple  of things that Bill McDonough  and Ed Boehne  pointed out  yesterday  andtoday.  Both of them  discussed the need to be forward-looking  with monetary  policy,  given thelong lags that are  involved and the fact that  we have to rely on forecasts  as a result.  Both ofthem, particularly  Ed today,  noted a  sense of disconnect  between the theory involved  in most ofour forecasts  and the reality of what  we see in terms of a highly competitive  businessenvironment  and a commitment  within that environment  to stable,  if not declining,  prices  even inthe  face  of rather tight labor and other capacity  constraints.  I agree  with that.  We  have seen  thesame  process  in our own  District, and  I have heard  a million  anecdotes about cost-cutting  andproductivity  improvements.  There really does  seem to be  a new environment  out there.However,  it seems  to me that while  theory  and reality can be slightly divergent in  thereal economy  at present,  the same  may be true  in the financial  markets, only  in the oppositedirection.  In the financial markets, theory  suggests that real  interest rates  are  high by historicalstandards.  However, we  have the reality of booming capital markets,  enormous  liquidity, andincipient real estate booms that people  all around the table mentioned  in our discussionyesterday.  It is true that some  staff material we received  yesterday  with a salmon-colored  coversuggested that  it is  difficult to find  evidence  of a real estate boom nationally.  But, we certainly7/1-2/97do see it in Boston.  Current conditions in the financial  markets  and apparently  starting to emergein the real estate markets  say to me that real  interest  rates in reality  are not high, and thatmonetary policy at this point may be  a bit too accommodative  for those kinds  of markets.  I donot believe that monetary  policy ought to be used to reduce  stock  market prices or asset  prices,but I do think we run the  risk that the  ebullience  we have today in financial  markets will  flowover  into real  estate markets  and even increase  the  sense of wealth that consumers  and businessesnow have.This is where the boom/bust scenario  that I mentioned  yesterday  comes in.  We  allknow what happens  when  asset bubbles occur in financial  and real estate markets.  We saw thatin the late  1980s  in this country;  we saw it in Japan as  well.  People begin to believe that theprices  of their assets  can only go up.  Banks begin  lending for any project, viable or not.Everyone  who can pick up a hammer becomes a construction  worker, and  all of this feeds  backinto the economy  in the form  of increasing  pressures and rising prices.  I think the boom isinevitably  followed by a bust and the anecdotal  evidence  suggests the bigger  the boom, thebigger the bust.There  is no question  that our economy  right now  is about as good as it gets.  AsPresident Boehne  and  others have pointed  out, we  should be very pleased about that, and I thinkthere is good reason for waiting and  seeing right  now.  But with  strong continuing  forwardmomentum  in economic  activity,  tight labor markets,  and indications of incipient if not fullyrealized  asset bubbles, I think there are real danger  signs.  You have mentioned,  Mr. Chairman,the need over the near term to think about  tightening  monetary policy.  I am very much inagreement with that.  I wanted to interject  this note  of caution from the financial  as opposed to7/1-2/97the real  side  of the  economy,  but I  am, as  I said, in  favor of your recommendation  at thismeeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I agree  with "B"  asymmetric.  Since inflation  and  pipeline  inflationlook pretty benign, it seems to me that  there is time to see whether the economy will  slow to  amore sustainable  growth rate.  With regard to  symmetry,  since  there is more likelihood that weare going to tighten  than to ease and since  we adopted  an asymmetric  directive at the  lastmeeting,  I think the asymmetry  should be  continued.  Should we tighten  in August or early fall,we would look rather foolish if we had just removed the bias.  I continue  to believe that we willhave to tighten in view  of the strong labor and equity  markets, but it does  seem to me that thereis time to let the  situation develop  a bit.  At 5-1/2 percent,  the  federal  funds rate may not be thatfar out of alignment, particularly  as long rates  have come down.  So, I think we should  conserveour monetary tools  for now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I would  favor alternative C.  Basically, my  rationalewould be that we should  be acting  to protect  against the prospect of a future  rise in inflation, ifnot to  lock in  the recent windfall  in  terms of the decline  in inflation we have  actually witnessed.Having said  that, I recognize  the implausibility  of acting now when we didn't  last month witharguably a stronger  case in terms of current as opposed to forward-looking  data.  But relatingwhere we are  to the discussion we had  yesterday, I think the current situation  we find ourselvesin demonstrates  what I would call  the emptiness  of an opportunistic  disinflation strategy  in theabsence of a clear goal.  The way  I look at it, what better time than now to act opportunistically7/1-2/97when the economy  is strong and  the risk of recession is low?  It really  is inconceivable  to me thatwe would exercise  monetary  restraint  in  or immediately after a recession  to achieve  lowerinflation.  Circumstances  would conceivably  be different now  if the  public had  a clear idea  that 3percent inflation  was not price  stability in our view.  I think prudent  actions  on our part toachieve a  lower rate of inflation  would be anticipated  and better understood in the context  of aclear price stability objective.I believe  it is extremely  important  that our discussion of yesterday  be continued  andbroadened,  with the ultimate  aim of agreeing  on a sensible long-term  monetary policy  objectiveand strategy.  In a sense,  our hands are  tied right now because  we have not been clear in thatregard.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I agree with your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman, that  atthis  point no  action  is the best course  mainly because  any rationale  we might  have for takingaction  would not be well  understood  and would not be credible.  And therein  lies the challenge  ofmoving  ahead from here.  How do we make  any rationale that we have credible  to the array ofaudiences  that we have  out there?  I think that what  is credible  as a rationale changes  dependingon the nature of the economic  environment  and trend.  Certainly,  it makes quite  a difference  ifwe are  facing pure demand-side  or pure supply-side  forces.  If we  are experiencing  a favorableproductivity  shock,  then we would  expect downward  pressure  on the level  of output prices andan increase  in asset prices.  One version  of opportunism would be to want  to lock in  that lowerlevel  of output  prices.  But an  inadvertent conversion  of a favorable  supply  development  into ademand  shock or an  excess demand  situation would not be seen in rising unit labor costs or in7/1-2/97rising output prices.  We  would not see it in  those markets.  While  we tend to look at retail  salesand other nonfinancial  areas of the  economy,  that is not where  we would  see it.  We would  see itin speculative  developments  and asset prices.  Like  Cathy Minehan,  I too was struck  yesterdayby how many of you are hearing what I am starting to hear about  growing  signs  of speculativeactivity  in farm land, residential  real estate, and commercial  real  estate.  I worry  a little that thesesymptoms of speculative  excesses,  rather than the sort of things we normally  look at, may be thefirst early warning  signals  of developments  down the road that we would have to react  verysharply to.  As we move from here  to August,  I think we  need to be looking  for and worryingmore  about indications  of speculative  activity than about conventional  indicators  of wage-pushor cost-push inflation  such  as unit labor costs and that sort of thing.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  I think the  economy  is operating beyond  its potentialand that  we will have  to increase  interest  rates  eventually.  But I also  agree that  we do not seeany early evidence,  certainly no credible  evidence,  of wage  and price acceleration  at this point.So, I agree  that we  should wait for now.Gary Stern  stated his concern  that we may not be  willing to act promptly to addressearly  signs of rising  inflation.  I certainly  hope that we will be  willing to act promptly  andpreemptively  as  we did earlier  this year.  My concern  is that we are  going to start to see a littleinching up of inflation--a tenth  here, a  tenth there, no really large increases.  The methodologicalchanges  that the BLS is introducing  are going  to make  it more  difficult for people  outside  todetect this inching up of inflation, and  there will be a lot of pressure  for us not to take any  actionin  those circumstances.  There may be  some reluctance  on our part to act as well.  That is7/1-2/97something  we have to be very careful  about  and very concerned  about, but for now I  agree withyour recommendation  of a "B"  asymmetric  directive.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  we have had  a lot of favorable  reports  over theperiod since  the last meeting,  and like everybody  else I am encouraged  by them.  At the  sametime, as Cathy Minehan  emphasized  very appropriately,  we need  to keep our perspective.  Thelevel of economic  activity is still  very high.  Labor markets,  if anything,  are  tighter than theywere  at the time of our last meeting.  The data  suggesting  that aggregate demand  is  softeningfundamentals  seem to be in place  for a reacceleration  of consumer  spending  in the third quarter.This is  an expansion in which on  a number  of occasions we have  seen  a weak  quarter  followedby a resurgence  in  the following quarter.With respect to the  structure  of the  economy, I certainly  hope you  are right that it ischanging in  a way that can help us in conducting  monetary  policy.  But we just do not know that,as  Jerry Jordan  said.  I think we have  to be  careful  and cautious  about jumping to  any undulyfirm conclusions  in that regard.  I have  tried to balance  these considerations as best I can.  If itwere up to me, I would  still prefer to take out some  insurance now mainly because  it seems tome, in line with what Tom Melzer was saying earlier, that the risk of taking out that insurance  isless on balance than the risk  of not taking it out.  I also would make the point that a small movewould not be a tightening  of monetary policy.  That goes back to some things that I said earlier.7/1-2/97I believe that we do have  a rationale  for moving today, but I do not think it is a rationale that  thepublic is ready to accept.  We need to  do a better job of preparing  the public to  accept  it.  At thesame time, the recent news is encouraging.  I  feel at  least a little more comfortable  than I did atthe  last meeting.  I can  support your recommendation,  Mr. Chairman,  but I would definitely wantan asymmetric  directive.

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, healthy humility  is a virtue in the eyes  of the Lord,and I think you have given voice to  a certain level  of humility that we  all feel  in  the light of ourlack of understanding.  Happily and fortunately, the conditions that we  do not understand  arefavorable,  and  so far they are  holding.  I think your recommendation  accommodates  theseuncertainties.  It recognizes  the state  of affairs as  they exist, and it anticipates  the most likelycourse  of upcoming  events.  So,  I support  your recommendation.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Please  read the directive with the old language.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  I will be reading from page  30 in the  Bluebook, starting  toward thebottom:  "In  the implementation  of policy for the  immediate  future, the Committee seeks tomaintain  the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions.  In the context of the Committee'slong-run  objectives  for price stability and  sustainable economic  growth, and  giving carefulconsideration  to economic, financial,  and monetary developments,  somewhat greater  reserverestraint would or slightly lesser reserve  restraint might be acceptable  in the intermeeting  period.The contemplated  reserve  conditions are expected  to be consistent with moderate growth  in M2and M3  over coming months."7/1-2/97
