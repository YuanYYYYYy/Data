CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  have  to  approve the minutes.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Move  approval.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection.  I have  anextraordinary  item this  morning.  We  have  had  a request  from theChairman  of the  Council  of Economic  Advisers  to  receive  the weeklyreport  of the Manager  for  Foreign Operations  and  the weekly  report  ofthe  Manager  for  Domestic  Operations.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Little  does  he  know!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I will  say  it  is  sent  to  the  Treasury;  ithas  always  been  sent  to  them, historically.  The  question is  whetherwe  can  change this  rule  and  send  it  to  the Chairman  of the  Council  ofEconomic  Advisers  under  our  rules  of  confidentiality.  Does  anyonehave  a strong  opinion on  this?  Do  we  have  to  take  a formal  action?Does  this  have  to  appear  in the  record  so  we  have  to  have  a vote?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  No,  I don't  think so.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  There  used  to  be  projections  in  the  New Yorkreport  on  domestic  operations.  I don't  know;  maybe  they've  been takenout.  It  was  a source  of  leaks  earlier.  Peter,  do  you have  anyprojections  anymore  in  your  report?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  No,  in  the  Manager's  weekly  report we  do  notinclude  the  projections  in  what  has  been  going  to  the Treasury.  Iwould  think  if you  approve this,  we'd  send the  same  [to  the  Chairmanof the  Council].

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I remember we  had  problems  with that  some yearsago.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know that we  ever  had  a problem;  Iknow we  worried  about  it.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  you know,  it  was  distributed  widely  in  theTreasury to  something  like  150  people  some  years  ago.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  150?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  was  a big number!

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Mr.  Sprinkel has  not  lobbied  for  this.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I don't  think they have  150  people  anymore!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Not  hearing  any  objection--

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  I have  a question,  though:  Would this  continue tobe  sent  to  the  Chairman  ex  officio  or  is  it  specific to  the  presentChairman?5/21/85

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  once  you begin  this--.  Theproblem is:  I don't  know whether  any  subsequent  Chairman will  beinterested.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  I would  be  inclined to  sunset  the  decision atthe  end  of  the  present  Chairman's term of  office  and,  in  effect,  awaita new  request.  The  individual who  first  requests  information  likethis  may well  understand the  confidentiality with which  to  protect  it.The  next  guy may  not.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  worth  reviewing.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Mr.  Chairman,  if we  do  send  it,  I thinkprobably we  should  add  those  few words  to  our  present  memorandum  [onrules  regarding  confidentiality]  because  at  the  time  of  that  GAOinvestigation,  it  was  crucial  whether  the  procedures  we  were  followingwere  consistent  with the written  documentation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I assume  we  are  going to  add  it.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Then  there's  the  question  of  sunsetting  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Can  you take  it  out  at  the  time  you  sunset  it,Steve?  That  would  be  the  only  graceful  way  to  do  it.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I guess we  could.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  In  the  old  days,  the  guy  at  the  NewYork  Fed who  wrote the  report  could  never  read  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  We  can  add  "upon  request".

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  Mr.  Chairman,  is  there  some  sort  of  "need toknow" test?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  not  supposed to  go  to  anyone  elseother than  those who  receive  it.  But--how many people  here  read  thisreport?[Secretary's  note:  Among those whose  hands  were  raised,  onlyMr.  Wallich  spoke.]

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Well,  not  every  report.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  I have  the  sense  of  the  meeting.Mr.  Cross.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Comments?  Questions?

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Sam,  this  kind  of information,  I think,  issubstantially  ignored  by  the people  who  are  working  on  the  exercise  ofthe  G-10  Deputies--the  reform  of  the  monetary  system.  The  discussionof  intervention  there  continues  exactly  along  the  old  lines  of whatwas  said  at  the  time  of the  study--we  can  do  a little but  not  much andso  forth.  But  there was  no  sense  from  any  of  the  central  bankers  or5/21/85Treasury people  there  of a cumulative  deterioration  of markets,  whichI take  it  to  be  the  implication  of what  you  say.

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  Well,  certainly the  complaints  about marketconditions  have  been much,  much worse.  And there's  no  doubt  that  theday-to-day volatility in  the  past  two  or  three months  has  been fargreater  than in  earlier  periods.  We've  been  hearing  for  a long timefrom the banks  regarding their  concern  about  the  market's  conditionand  we're  beginning to  hear more  complaints  from  some of  the  corporaterepresentatives  at  this  point.  That's  a new  element  in this.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are  the banks  not  making  any money  thesedays?

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  Generally  speaking, most  are  making money  on  theexchange market,  if  you look  at  their  quarterly  reports.  With  somenotable  exceptions,  they continue  to make money.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Though  less  so  in  the  first  quartercompared  to  last  year.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  Less  so.  It  does  vary;  it  moves  up  and  down.But  at  least  at  the  banks  in  New York that  we  keep  an  eye  on,  thenumber  of  quarters  in  which they had  large  losses was  very  few andthat  was  only  at  a very few institutions.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  To  me  it's  astonishing,  given whathas  been going  on  in  this market,  that  somebody  hasn't  taken one  greatbig loss  in  foreign  exchange  operations.  It's  a miracle.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Is  it  a miracle  or have  they hedged  theirpositions  sufficiently  so  that  they get  by?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  The  logic  of that  can  only  take  youso  far.  Somebody  somewhere  is  absorbing  the  price  risk  associatedwith this  volatility.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  I think  the  banks  are  withdrawing more  and morefrom the market,  so  they are  protecting themselves  by being  much moreunwilling to  be market-makers  except  in  limited conditions  than  theywere  before.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Are  they hedging  or  are they  using  some  creativeaccounting?

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  No,  they're  just  not  doing  business.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  No,  I'm  talking  about  the  traders  not  the  banks.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Everybody  can't  be  hedged;  that'sclear  enough.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  It  is  a matter  of  considerable  concern.  Thevolatility  did  increase  considerably,  of  course,  after  the  operationsin late  February.  Now, that  does  not  mean  necessarily that  peopleshould be  unhappy about  the  heavy  intervention in  late  February.  Butthere  is  a question  of whether  there  should  be  some  follow up  to  thatkind  of  arrangement  to  provide  for  a little  more  structure  in  the5/21/85short-term variability.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  There's  short-term variability, hourlyvariability, daily  variability, and  intra-daily variability.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  What  I've  been talking  about  here  was  intra-day--the  amount  during  one  24-hour  day--which,  as  I say,  now averages  about2 percent  whereas  in  earlier  periods  it  was  much  less.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  in  the  absence  of  a constructivesuggestion we'll turn  to  Mr.  Sternlight.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Discussion?  If  not,  we'll  ratify thetransactions.  Motion?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So move.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Without  objection.  Mr.  Prell.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  When  I listen to  you,  I wonder how you  getall  those  projected  GNP  increases.  Well,  what  comments  are  there?Mr.  Black.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Mike,  do  you have  the  figures  for  gross  domesticpurchases  and  domestic  final  purchases  for  the first  quarter  as  apercentage  increase?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes,  for  brevity,  I eliminated  a sentence  inwhich  I was  going  to  refer to  gross  domestic  purchases.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Well, you  alluded to  it.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  For  the  first  quarter,  it  was  4 percent;  andfinal  sales  to  domestic  purchasers was  3-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  In  both  cases,  it  was  down  by  1/2  percentage

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Yes,  I believe  so.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Down by  0.4  on  the  first  one  and  0.8  on thepoint.[second].

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Ted  tells  me  the  3-1/2  percent  final  sales  todomestic  purchasers  is  unchanged.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  But  the  reduction  of  4  [tenths]  is  primarily,  Ithink,  a consequence  of  governmental  purchases  rather than  privatefinal  purchases.  That  is,  the private  final  purchases  were  actuallyrevised  up  somewhat  from what  they had  been.  That  part  does  notsignify  anything.5/21/85

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  What  were  those  figures,  Lyle?  Do  you have  them?

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  The  domestic  final  demand was  revised  down  from1673.2  to  1672.9  but  the  private  component  thereof was  increased  from1362.6  to  1363.8.  I don't  have  the  growth  rate,  but  it  is  a tinylittle  adjustment.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Mike,  I thought  I heard  you suggest  that  therewould  be  less  strength  in  state  and  local purchases  looking  ahead.That  sort  of  surprises  me;  I had  the  impression  that  revenues  werecoming  in  very well  and  I assumed  that  expenditures  in  the  state  andlocal  sector  would  rise  with more  prosperous  times.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Well,  it  is  certainly  the  case  that  theiroperating capital  account  budget  surplus  position  has  improved  overthe  past  year,  and we  think  it  will  stay  reasonably  positive.  Lastyear  there  was  some  spurt  in  construction outlays,  but  on  the wholethere was  not  a tremendous  growth  of  state  and  local  expenditures.The  first  quarter  of this  year  doesn't  look  particularly  strong.  Andwhile there  is  a lot  of talk  about  a backlog  of  repair  and  renovationwork that  needs  to  be  done,  we  just  don't  see  the  evidence  of  it.  Ithink there  is  a  great  deal  of  caution on  the  part  of many  state  andlocal  government  units  about  forging  ahead  with  spending  programspartly  because,  given  taxpayer  attitudes,  they  don't think  they  aregoing to  be  able  to  keep  all  those  tax  revenues  that  they  got  fromincreasing  taxes  in  earlier  years.  Then  there  is  the  question of  whatwill  happen  both with tax  reform  and  federal  spending.  Both the  Houseand  Senate  proposals  spell  the  end  of  grants  to  state  and  localgovernment  revenue  sharing  by  1987.  So,  I think  there  is  a good  dealof  caution being  exercised.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Are we  ready  for  comments  or  are we  still  in thequestion  period?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We're  in  the  comment  period.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Well,  I have  been  out  travelling  around  theDistrict more  than  usual  this  spring  and  talking  to  lots  of  people  indifferent  kinds  of businesses.  It  is  a  little hard  to  summarize  thesituation  because  there  is  such  great  variability  among  industries.In  general,  what  I find  is  that  people  are  saying:  "Well, thingsaren't  great,  but  they  aren't terrible  either."  In  my District  thereseems  to  be  a changing  economic mix more  toward  some  of the  fastergrowing  sectors  and  away  from the  traditional manufacturing  area.  So,in  general,  I think the  tone  is  probably a little  better  in  myDistrict  than  it  might  be  in  some  others.One  thing  that  did  strike me,  as  I was  talking  to  lots  ofpeople,  is  that  the  expectations  about the  economic  outlook  seem to  mein a  rather  precarious  zone  right  now.  Earlier,  around  the  start  of arecovery when  expectations  are  generally for  expansion, if  you  get  abearish  statistic,  it  is  greeted  as  an  aberration and  it  doesn'treally  have very much  effect  on  expectations.  When you  get  into  arecession it  is  just  the  other way  around:  Everyone thinks  things  aregoing  downhill  and  if  you  get  a bullish  statistic,  that  is  viewed  asan  aberration.  With this  kind  of  bombardment  of mixed  signals  that  weare  getting,  I think we  are  in  a period  where  expectations  couldchange  rather  rapidly.  Right  now  I think the  predominant  view is5/21/85still  that  the  economy  is  going  to  continue  to  expand;  but  there  arejust  enough  [negative]  reports  coming  in,  that  people  can  shift  over.It  is  almost  like  a teeter  totter  and  the  weight  of  opinion  couldshift  more  toward  the  down  side.  A  story  that  somebody told meillustrates  this.  A  person who  runs  a medium size  capital  goods  firm,a family business,  told  me  that while  they  still  expect  a good  secondhalf, what  makes  her nervous  is  that  the  salesmen,  instead  of  buyingcars  and boats,  are  now buying  CDs  in  insured  institutions.  And thatgives  her a  great  deal  of pause  about what  might  happen.  So,  I thinkwe  are  in  a  gray  area  where these  expectations  could  change  ratherrapidly.On  the  inflation  front,  I just  don't  sense  any  great  concernabout  inflation.  Most  people  that  I spoke to  are talking  about  fairlymoderate wage  increases.  They  find  it  difficult  to  pass  on  priceincreases  and  they  find  that  the  prices  from  their  suppliers  areholding  fairly  steady.  So,  whatever  the  statistics  coming  in,  I justdon't  find  much out  there  on  the  inflation  side.  The  influence  of theinternational  sector  continues  to  strike me  in  a dramatic  way.  In  thesmallest  of  businesses  and  the  smallest  of towns  one  keeps  hearingmore  about  world markets  and  world  trade.  I have heard  even moreconcern  this  spring about  Korean  imports  than  Japanese  imports;  thatseems  to  be  the  new kind  of  enemy,  if  you want  to  look  at  it  that  way.More  and more  business  people  are  expressing  concern about  competitionfrom  the Koreans.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Martin.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  I would  like  to  add  some  rail  cars  to  thelocomotive  of  expectations  already  alluded  to.  I am  struck by  thecumulative  nature  of  the  vulnerabilities  of markets  and  of  thefinancial  side  of  the  economy.  Notice  that  in  our  first  two  reportsthis  morning there were  some  comments  on  the  variability  in  foreignexchange markets.  Think  of the  junk  bond  phenomenon, which  continuesinto  this  year.  The  SEC  indicated that  they  are  not  disposed  tointervene  in the merger  and  acquisition  surge.  You are  talking  about$80  or  $90  billion  at  an  annual  rate  of  equity  retirement  replaced  bydebt.  In  the  commodity markets  and  the  COMEX in  New York,  the  threelargest  traders  failed  to  meet  a margin  call  one  day,  though  it  wasonly  a temporary  phenomenon.  As  for  the  LDC  debt  deterioration, weget  reports  out  of Argentina  on  a series  of  private  bank failures;  thegovernment  steps  in  and  this  passes.  Capital  flight has  resumed  fromthe  LDCs  and  various  measures  we're  all  familiar  with are  beingimplemented there.  It  is  not  all  one-sided,  of  course.  We  have  whatsounds  like  favorable news  out  of Venezuela  and the  Philippines,  butstill  there  is  the  onus  of this  capital  flight  situation.  Newspapersin  the  last  few days  have  had  the  Coldwell Bankers  survey,  which talksabout  $25  billion  plus  of  nonresidential  construction coming  onstream--80  percent  above  1980.  I think  there  is  a kind  of  frenzy  ofoffice  building and  other  kinds  of  activity.  Sooner  or  later  that  isgoing  to  put  pressure  on major  money  funds  around the  country  becausetens  of billions  of dollars  are  coming  in  there,  resulting  inoverbuilding.  Multiple unit  dwellings  are  hung  on  the  revenue Mbonds,  industrial  revenue  bonds--techniques  that  are  a tax  phenomenonin  part.  Vacancies  are  accumulating there.  As  for  government  bonddealers,  obviously,  we  know the work  that  has  been  done  in  that  areaby the  New  York  Fed.  But  I wonder  if we  weren't  so  concerned  with  thecost  and we  weren't  so  concerned with  the  smooth  running  of  this5/21/85enormous market,  if maybe we  might have  come  up  with  something  alittle  less  voluntary  and more  like  the  rulemaking  being  extended  inthe  municipal  securities market.  But  we  have  the vulnerabilities  tocontend with  and who wants  to  take that  chance?  Ed  Gray has  talkedabout  $100  billion  in  savings  and  loan  assets  in  savings  and  loansthat  are  essentially  defunct.  Well,  that's  $100  billion out  of  anindustry that  is  10  times  that  large  that  he has  found;  and  I wonderwhat  else  is  out  there  that  could  come  around  to  haunt us.The  President  is  about  to  go  on  the  road  to  present  the  so-called  tax  reform  and  simplification  program.  There  is  going to be  agreat  deal  of attention  to  top  bracket  rates  and  a  capital  gainstreatment  a little  more favorable  than  the Treasury  proposal.  Is  thatgoing to  add  to  a speculative  bubble that  seems  to  be  occurring  innow?  And how many  of  these things  need  to  go  down  in  one  day,  oneweek,  or  one  month before  we  talk about  expectations  and  attitudes?Government  securities  and  mortgage-backed  securities  markets  areenormous markets  trading hundreds  and  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollarsnow.  And  one  day,  Ginnie  Mae,  Fannie  Mae,  or  Freddie Mac may  decidethey  are  not  going to  settle.  Well,  all  that  [happened  in  the past]and  there were  negotiations  and  so  forth  and  every  one  of  thesepotential  crises worked  out  fine.  Everybody  saluted  and  got  in  [line]and  did  what  they had  to  do  and  it  worked.  But  what  are  the  dangersthat  we  are  facing  here?I am  not  so  concerned  about  the  tiny bit  of  evidence  of priceincrease;  I certainly  am concerned  about  unemployment and  the  lack  ofemployment  growth  and  the  0.7  percent  real  growth  figure  that  thatimplies.  Think  of  the  cumulative  nature  of  financial  vulnerabilitiesof the  country  right  now.  I think  I voted  for--maybe  I even made  themotion,  I can't  remember--the  [recent]  discount  rate  cut.  I think weshould  have  done that.  But  my  goodness,  let  us  be  aware  of  what  we  donext  in  terms  of this  tremendous  pervasive,  ubiquitous,  financialvulnerability that  we  have  here.  That  is  my  cheerful  message.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know whether  [that  means]  weshould tighten  up  or  ease  up.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  The  remedy  for that  is  good  old-fashionedmonetary  discipline--make credit  tight  enough.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Well,  I do  think we  are  in  a period when  thesignals  are  decidedly  mixed  at  best  and  are  very  conflicting.  Thegood  businesses  are  continuing to  do  pretty  well  and  are  continuing  ata pretty  good  level;  the  automobile  business  is  good  even though  ithas  leveled  off a bit.  Those  in  the  industry  do  say  that  the  dip  inthe  early part  of  May  should not  be taken  as  a change  in the  trend.They  view it  rather  as  a comparative  issue,  given  a very strong  periodthe  year before.  Retail  sales  in our  District,  if you  put  March andcommercial  building is  particularly strong--indeed  I think  perhaps  toostrong;  steel  output  is  rising  a bit;  and  the service  sector  isstrong.  But  on the  negative  side,  I think the news  is  very  serious.The  capital  goods  people  are  experiencing a slowdown  this  year  as5/21/85compared to  last  year,  and  last  year  certainly was  not  very  strong.One  CEO  I talked to  who  has  a very  heavy  commitment  to  the  capitalgoods  sector  said  that  his  company  had a  really dreadful  month invery,  very  worried  about  the  outlook.The  agricultural  situation  is  deteriorating  further.  Landvalues  are  down.  We had  a  good  planting  season this  year  and  areconsiderably  ahead  of  last  year;  some  83  percent  of the  farm plantingis  done.  Therefore,  over  the  long time  between  now  and harvest  theoutlook  is  for  higher  levels  of  production, which will  have  adepressing  effect  on  commodity prices.  Anybody  who  has  anything to  dowith  the  agricultural  sector is  having  a very tough time.  Theimplement  people  are  operating their  plants  at  about  30  percent  ofcapacity  and  there  is  a  significant number  of  plants  that  have  justsimply  shut  down.  I commented last  time  that  railroad  shipping andcar-loadings  were  down;  we  have had  another  period here  in  which therailroad  shippings  are  down.  There's  an  interesting  importimplication here  that  one  man told  me  about.  Whereas  before  they  wereshipping  [unintelligible],  now the  parts  are  coming  in  in  a finishedstate  and  are  by  and  large  being  shipped by  truck.On  the  inflation front,  I think the  news  is  mixed.  I agreewith  Mike  that  many  of the  positive  factors  may be  behind  us  and  thatthere  are  some  very  significant  increases  taking  place  in  the  servicesside,  in pretty  steep  amounts.  But  more positively,  I am impressedwith  the number  of  people  I have  talked  to  who  are  still  renegotiatingcontracts  for  three years  in  the  3 to  4 percent  area.  And  they arefinding their  union negotiators  to  be  very, very  flexible  with  regardto  work  rules.  They  are  getting  very  significant productivityincreases  as  a consequence  of  this.  And the  pricing out  there  isterribly  competitive;  the  people  I have talked  to  just  simply  can'tget  price  increases  through  in  a full  sense.  If  there  are  any  trendsthat  are  persistent  in  all  this,  I think one  is  that  expectations  arebeing  revised  downward.  I haven't  talked with  anybody who  is  revisinghis  expectations upward.  No  one  that  I talked  with  suggests that  weare  on  the  edge  of  a recession;  nonetheless,  they  do  think  that theoutlook  for the  rest  of the  year  and  next  year  is  more modest.I think that  the  most  significant  trend  is  this  export-importproblem and  the  dollar value.  I have  a couple of  anecdotes.  First,cement--and  I have  always  had  the  feeling that  cement was  a commoditythat  was  very,  very transportation sensitive  in  that beyond  200 miles[shipments]  fell  off the  edge  of the  table.  Fifteen  percent  of  thecement  consumption this  year  is  going  to  be  from  imports, which  I findrather  staggering.  Also,  we  had  our  first meeting  of our  smallbusiness  advisory  council,  a group  that  I would  have thought  would beabsolutely  insulated from this  dollar  problem.  We  had  arepresentative  from and both  of  them said  that  without  a  single doubt  the most  difficultproblem they are  having  is  the  export-import  problem--the value  of thedollar.  Their  industries  and  businesses  are  being very  hard  hit  byimports.  As  I look  at  it,  I think this  high  value  of the dollar  isthe  most  pervasive  problem that  we  are  dealing with.  The  economicnews  is  pretty mixed  and  the  inflation news  is  pretty mixed,  and  Ithink that  we  are  probably  in  a period  where  it  is  awfully  difficultto tell  how the  future  is  going  to  unfold.Indiana,  and  one  from Iowa5/21/85

MR. FORRESTAL.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  conditions  in  ourpart  of  the  country  pretty much mirror  what  is  going on  in  the  rest  ofthe  country  in  terms  of mixed  signals.  The  service  industrythroughout  the  District  seems  to  be  doing  pretty well.  We  have  fairlygood  news  with  respect  to  construction,  real  estate,  tourism and  soon;  but  the  bad  news  is  related  to  the  manufacturing  sector  and  thosesectors  that  are  dependent  on  a  lower  dollar--particularly textiles,apparel,  and  agriculture  to  some  extent.  Energy  is  also  a  negative  inthe  economy.  With  respect  to  the  apparel  industry,  you might  beinterested  in  knowing  that  the  protectionist  sentiment  is  growing  byleaps  and  bounds.  Their  latest  slogan  is  "Take  off  your  foreignclothes."I  am also  concerned  about  the  overbuilding,  particularly  inoffices  and  multifamily  structures,  that  seems  to  be  going  on  in manycities  in  the  Southeast.  I  think that  is  creating  vacancy  rates  thatare  going  to  be  unsustainable  in  the  long  run.  So,  as  we  look  atwhat's  going  on  in  our  District  and  around  the  country,  I  think wewould  now  revise  our  forecast  down  somewhat.  That  seems  to  be  thegeneral  sentiment  of  people  that  I  talked  to.  Expectations  are  beingcautiously  revised  downward.  Like  Si,  I  don't  hear  anybody  talkingabout  a  recession;  but  on  the  other  hand,  I  think  there's  a  great  dealof  concern  about  where  the  economy may  be  going.  On balance,  we  don'tdiffer  significantly  from  the  projections  in  the  Greenbook.  Ifanything,  our  expectations  in  the  near  term may  be  a  little  lower  thansuggested  in  the  Greenbook.  Going out  a  little  further,  I  think  thereduction  in  the  discount  rate  and  other  short-term interest  ratesmight  give  a  little  push  to  the  economy, but  with  a  lag--later  on  inthe  year.  So  as  I  look  out  over  the  horizon,  I  think  the  risk  is  onthe  down  side  for  the  economy,  and  I  think  growth  for  the  rest  of  theyear  is  going to  be  just  barely  acceptable.I  would  say  one  other  thing about  sentiments  in  the  District,and  that  is  that there  is  a  great  deal  of  concern  now about  thefinancial  stability  of  the  banking  system.  If you  put  together all  ofthe  various  episodes  that we  have  had,  people  are  asking:  Is  this  justthe  tip  of  the  iceberg  or  is  there more?  With these  governmentsecurities  dealers,  firms  like  E.F.  Hutton  and  so  on,  the  list  goes  onand  on.  While  there may  not  be  any direct  relationships  among  all  ofthese,  the  psychological  atmosphere  that  is  being  created  is  one  ofmounting  distrust  in  the  financial  system  or  concern  about  whether  thestability  of the  system  is  what  it  should  be.  People  are  askingquestions  very  strongly  about  that.  In  summary,  Mr.  Chairman, my viewnow--and  I  haven't  had  this  view before--is  that  the  economy  istottering  a  little  and  that  our  policy  prescription  needs  to  take  thatinto  account.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  How do  you respond  to  that  question?

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Which  question?

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  About  the  financial  stability.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Well,  my  stock  answer,  which  I  think  is  thecorrect  one,  is  that  the  banking  system  is  in  good  shape  and  thatthese  are  isolated  incidents.  I  say  that  with my  fingers  crossed.5/21/85-10-

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  Mr.  Chairman,  reverting for  a  moment  to  thesimilarities  and  dissimilarities  of  the  Board  staff's  forecast  to  ourstaff's  forecast:  We  have  similar views  on  the  outlook  going throughthe  fourth  quarter  of  this  year  in  a  number  of  major  areas  includingconsumption,  capital  spending,  government  spending,  and  inventories.Where we  differ,  and  where  our  staff  turns  out  to  be  somewhat  lessoptimistic  than  the  Board's  staff,  is  with respect  to  our  expectationthat  imports  will  be  up  somewhat  more  because  of  the  recent  behaviorof  the  dollar  and  that  housing will  be  up  somewhat  less  than  the  Boardstaff's  projection because  of  the  weakness  in  disposable  income.  So,even  though  our  two  forecasts  tend to  converge,  ours  is  up  a  littlefrom  last  month  and  the  Board  staff's  outlook  for  real  GNP  has  beenrevised  downward  this  time  from  last  month.  We  are  stillsignificantly  lower  for  the  year  as  a  whole,  showing  a  2  percent  realGNP  gain, fourth  quarter to  fourth  quarter,  versus  the  Board  staff'sview  of  2-1/2  percent.  Whether  it  is  2  or  2-1/2  percent,  it  is  stillgoing  to  be  a  pretty  weak year.  I  share  the  view that  we  areexperiencing  already--and  are  likely to  see  more  of  it  as  the  yeargoes  on--a  pretty  sluggish  economy  operating  below its  potential,  inlarge  part  because  of  an  enormous  distortion  and  imbalance  that hasalready  been  touched on,  particularly  relating  to  the  impact  of  thehuge  federal  deficit  and  the  high  dollar  and  the  import  surge  that  hasresulted  from all  of  that.Like  Si,  we  recently  had  our  meeting of  our  council  on  smalla  very  small  manufacturer  up  inbusiness  and  agriculture  in  response  to  your  suggestion.  We  got  awhole  earful  of  bad  news  and  I,  too,  was  surprised  by  some  of  theanecdotes  that  we  heard.  For  example,  one  of  the  small  business  firmsrepresented was Oregon,  which  is  outside  the  Portland metropolitan  area.  It  turns  outthat  they  export  a  good  deal  of equipment  all  around the world;more  than  half  of  their business  in  fact  is  foreign.  We  really  gotsome  graphic  illustrations  of  what  the  high  dollar  has  done  to  thissmall  little  business.  We  found  similar  illustrations  from  otherrepresentatives  of  small  concerns  that  were  there.  Contrary  toconditions  in  your  District,  Si,  or  yours, Roger,  where  the  familyfarm  still  predominates,  as  you  know  in  the  West  it  is  the  large  scalefarm that  predominates.  And  even  representatives  of  those  agri-businesses  were  singing  the  blues  and  gave  some  pretty  graphicillustrations  of  how bad  business  was,  not  just  because  of  the  highinterest  rates  but  also  the  strong dollar.  Cotton  is  one  of  the majorproducts  of  our  agriculture  in  California  and  traditionally  about  80percent  of  it  has  been  exported.  You  can  imagine  what  the  high  dollarhas  done  to  cotton  exports;  that  particular  business  is  in  bigtrouble.Based  on  the  latest  information  we  have,  nearly  all  of  thenine  states  in  our  District  experienced  an  increase  in  unemploymentfractionally;  and  in  the  latest  month  for which  we  have  data  for totalemployment,  it  actually dropped  a  bit.  Electronics,  which  had  beenone  of  our  stronger  growth industries  for  some  years  is  now  flat;manufacturing has  been  rather  weak except  for  defense  spending;  andlumber  is  still  a  disaster.  Aerospace  is  the  one  industry  still  goingfairly  strong.  On  balance,  adding  up  all  these  strong  and  weak areas,it  is  clear that  the  weaknesses  predominate  and  that we  are  seeing  inthe  West what  we  are  seeing  in  the  national  statistics:  a  pretty5/21/85-11-sluggish  performance.  Therefore,  when we  get  around to  the  policydiscussion, that  would  be  the  reason  I would  like  to  err,  if we  aregoing  to  err  at  all,  on the  side  of  ease.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Black.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman,  I have  long  since  abandoned  anyhope  that  anybody  can do  very  well  in  projecting the  economic  outlookover  any  extended  period  of time.  I am  particularly uncomfortable  intrying to  do  that  today because  the  signals  are  so  mixed.  But  havingsaid  that,  my  guess  would be  that  if  the  staff  forecast  is  wrong,  itstill  pretty strong  and  the  sharp  growth in  M1  back in  the winter  islikely  to  keep  it  fairly  strong.  The  real  question  is:  What's  goingto  happen  to  imports?  And  I don't  think we  know  the  answer  to  that.I agree  with the  staff's  assessment  that  the  dollar probably haspeaked  and  will  continue  on  down.  When  that will  be  felt by  someslowing  in  the  rate  of  increase  of  imports,  I don't  know;  it  may be  in1986  as  Mike  suggested.  We  were  thinking we  probably would  see  someeffects  before  then.  In  any  event,  we  think that  by  the  last  half  ofthis  year  GNP might  be  somewhere  around  the  3.3  percent  growth thatthe  staff is  projecting for  the  last  half of  this  year.On  the  implicit  assumption on  velocity that  the  staff hasmade,  if we  had the  kind  of  growth  in  M1  that  they  seem to  be  talkingabout--say,  6-1/2  percent  from the  fourth quarter  of  last year  to  thefourth  quarter  of this  year--that  implies  a slight  decline  in M1velocity.  If we  get  a more  rapid  rate  of  growth  in  Ml,  that  would  ofcourse mean more  than  that,  and  that  would be  very unusual  for  thisstage  of a business  expansion.  I certainly wouldn't  say  it  can'thappen, but  I don't  think it  is  very  likely.  So  in  short,  I don'tbelieve the  general  economic  outlook  provides  any very  compellingreasons  at  this  point  for  any  significant move  toward  ease.  It  istempting to  think  in  terms  of  ease,  as  we  see  all  these  worries  thatPres  has  outlined.  But  to  me  at  this  point  that  really  wouldexacerbate  most  of  these problems.  It  was  excessively  easy  policy,coupled with  some  other  things,  that  I think created most  of  these  inthe  past.  To  me  it  is  time,  even though  the  statistics  seem to  beflashing  danger  signals,  to  keep  our  eye  on  our  long-run objective.  Iwould try to  keep  the  aggregates  under  control;  specifically,  I had  inmind  trying to  get  M1  back  somewhere within these  target bands  that  weset  for  ourselves.

MR.  MORRIS.  I want  to  applaud  the  Board  for  reducing thediscount  rate,  although the  timing  I found a little  surprising.  But--

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  You  can't  win!

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I think  [unintelligible]  that  the  economy  hasperformed  in a much weaker  fashion than  I expected  or  than  I thinkmost  of us  expected  a few months  ago.  I am  finding  in the  comments  ofbusinessmen--right  across  the  board  regardless  of  the  industry,  againwith  the  exception  of the  defense  industry--that they  all  tell me  thatorders  are  coming  in  at  lower  rates  than  they had  contemplated.  Andthere  is  a very  sobering  mood developing.  Another  phenomenon--I  don'tknow whether it  is  confined  to  the New England  area  and  I would like5/21/85-12-to  hear  some  other  comments  on this--is  that  a lot  of businessmen  aretelling me  that they have  been waiting for  the dollar to  go  down  sothat  they  can  begin competing in  world markets  again.  They  have  aboutgiven up  on  that,  so  they  are  planning  in  a great  many  industries  toexpand their production  facilities  abroad.  That  is  the  only way thatthey  can compete  in world markets;  they  can't  do  it  from a U.S.  base.In the  past  few years,  the  decline  in U.S.  direct  investment  abroadhas  been  an  element  of  strength  in the  dollar.  But  if  we  see  a prettywidespread movement  to  build new  production  capacity  abroad,  thatcould  very  well  put  downward  pressure  on  the  dollar  at  some  point  ifthe  movement  got  very  far.  Has  anybody else  run  into  this  phenomenon?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I hear  the threat  all the  time.  EverybodyI talk to--

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  But  they  are  beginning  to  plan  to  do  it  now.That's  the  difference.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Rice.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I think the  major  concern  iswhether  the  economy  is  going  to  rebound moderately  in  the  second  halfas  projected  in  the  staff forecast  or  whether  it  is  going to  continuealong the  present  sluggish path.  Now,  if  one  is  convinced that  theeconomy is  going to  perform along  the  lines  of the  forecast  in  thesecond  half,  I don't  think we  need to  worry  too  much;  the worry thenwould be  about  next  year.  While  I think  the  staff  forecast  probablycaptures  the most  likely  outcome,  the  factors  supporting  that  outlookdo  not  seem to  me  to be  very  strong.  While we  probably  can  expectcontinued  strength  from residential  construction,  the  rate  of  growthin  business  fixed  investment  and  consumption expenditures  will  beon  some moderate  strength  in  both  these  categories.  So,  it  is  veryhard to  be  confident  that  there  is  this  basic  strength  in  spendingthat's  going to  produce this  outcome.  With  resource utilizationsignificantly below capacity, with capacity  utilization most  recentlyfalling--and  even  if it  stabilizes  from  this  point  on,  it  will  stillbe  at  a relatively  low  level--and with the  outlook for  unemploymentnot  very  reassuring  in  that  it  is  not  declining  significantly,  itseems  to  me  that  the  economy is  vulnerable  on the  down  side.  Thereseems  to  be  very  little  risk of  excessive growth  in  thesecircumstances.  So,  I would  say that  what we  can  reasonably  expect  isan  economy that  is,  as  Governor Martin put  it,  very vulnerable.  Itcould  go  either  way;  I see no  strong momentum in  either  direction.I think the  inflation  outlook is  moderate.  Most  of therecent  influences  on  the  inflation  rate  are  probably  temporary;  I amnot  convinced that  the  recent  spike  in  wage  costs  is  more  thantemporary.  I would  say,  therefore, that  with the inflation  outlookmoderate we  should  not  be  satisfied  with anything  less  than  a 3 to3-1/2  percent  rate  of  growth  in  the  second  half.  And  I think  weshould make  our  policy  judgments  with  that  particular  bias  in mind.Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Corrigan.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  looking  at  the  economyfirst  and  taking a little  longer  perspective on  it,  I think the5/21/85-13-numbers  would  suggest  that  domestic  final  demand  really has  beenperforming more  or  less  as  expected  for  the  third  year  of  the  recoveryand maybe  even  a little better than  expected.  But  the  wild  card,  ashas  been  amply  reflected  so  far  in  the discussion,  insofar  as  the  GNPand  production,  etc.,  is  the  external  side.  Against  that  backdrop,  Istill  lean to  the  view that  for  the balance  of  the year  real  GNP  islikely to  be  growing  in the  3 to  3-1/2  percent  range.  And  I thinkthat  this  recent  rather  pronounced decline  in  interest  rates  providesa little  further measure  of  insurance  in  that  direction.  At  the  sametime,  that  kind  of  forecast  is  one  that  assumes  a much  smaller dragcoming  from the  external  sector  over  the  balance  of  the  year.  Whileeconomists  seem  pretty  comfortable  as  a group  with that,  I will  bedarned  if  I can  find  a businessman--whether  in  small  or  largebusiness--who  agrees  with that.  I think that  remains,  therefore,  thewild  card.I agree  with those who  say  that  the  nonresidential sector--the  construction  sector in  particular--looks  very vulnerable  at  thispoint.  On this  question  of  financial  shocks  and  disturbances,  thepoint  has  to  be made--whatever  else  one  might  want  to  say  about  them--that  to  the  extent  that  they  are  being  managed  and  contained,  they  arebeing managed  and  contained with  a very high  degree  of  governmentinvolvement.  Whether  it  is  front  page  news  or  not,  that  has been  thecase.  Indeed,  what  I see  almost  daily is  the  situation where  "freethey  are  on  the  hook.  And  then that  slogan  goes  out  the window in  oneheck  of  a hurry.  I would  like to  say  that  I can  see  some  reemergenceof  discipline  growing out  of this  cumulation  of  problems,  but  I don'tsee  it.  The  leaders  in banking  and  investment  banking  institutions,foreign  and  domestic,  have  reached the  point  where  I think they wantdiscipline.  But  in  a setting in  which  all  of the  institutional  sandhas  been  taken  out  of the  wheels,  they don't  seem to  know how to  getit.  I think that  those vulnerabilities  in  that  setting are  somethingto be  concerned  about.On  the  inflation  side,  I keep  coming out  on the  side  of beinguneasy.  I look  at  the  numbers and  I listen  to  what  everybody  says  andI am tempted to  reach  the  same  conclusion  that  Governor Rice  juststated:  that these  are  all  temporary  things.  But  I can't  quite  getmyself  comfortable  with that.  Even  if  these things  are  temporary,  therate  of  inflation  that we  are  seeing  right  now,  against  the  backdropof  the  exchange  rate  that  we  are  seeing  right  now,  still  strikes  me  ashigh.  I am  concerned  that  if the  inflation  rate  were to  start  tocreep  up  from where it  is  now, even  by  a percentage  point  or  so,  andproduce  the  situation in  which we  felt  at  some  point  we  had to  moveagainst  that,  it  would be  a very,  very  difficult  thing to  engineer, toput  it  mildly.  But  more  importantly,  I think  some  of  this  financialpoint  of view that  says  somewhere  down  the  road  inflation is  going  tobail  this  situation  out.  So,  I can't  bring myself  to  be  sanguineabout  the  inflationary  situation,  even  though  I certainly don't  thinkit  is  something that  has  to  be  the number  one  priority  for  policy.But  I think it  has  to  be watched  very,  very  closely.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  First,  in  terms  of  our  District  economy,  I wouldcharacterize that  as  simply more  of the  same.  The  split that  we  have5/21/85had,  which may  be  most  easily  described  as  urban versus  rural,persists.  The  economy  in  the  urban areas--from  the  city  of Rochesterto  Sioux Falls  to  Rapid City--continues  to  do  reasonably well  onbalance;  the  economy  in  the  rural  areas  is  very  difficult  at  best.And  that  has  been  the  situation  for  quite  some  time.On the  national  level,  without  wanting  to  belabor  theobvious,  the  key  word  in  my mind is  uncertainty.  As  I look  at  theGreenbook forecast,  my  own  view of the  situation  is  that the  economyis  going  to  have  to  hustle  just  to  get  that  2.3  percent  real  growth inthe  second  quarter,  given  the  monthly  trajectory in  the  first  quarter.But  having  said  that,  I expect  that  the  economy may  do  a little betterthan the  Greenbook  suggests  in the  second half of  the year,  largelybecause  I think the  interest  sensitive  sectors  of  the  economy may  dosomewhat  better.  But  I would  re-emphasize the  term uncertainty.  I donot  have  a great  deal  of  confidence  in that  particular  scenario,although  it  is  the  one  that,  under the  circumstances,  I am  inclined  togo  with.We  too  have  had  our  first meeting of  our  advisory council  onsmall  business  and  agriculture,  and  we  included  labor  as  well.  Mostof  the news  would  have  to  be  described as  grim, particularly  from thepeople  associated with  the  agricultural  sector.  The  focus  of  concernseems  to  have  shifted  a bit,  however,  in  the  last  several months.  Thefocus  used  to  be  on the  producer--the  farmer.  I think now the  focusis  shifting  to  his  or  her  lender,  be  it  the  Farm Credit  System  or  theagricultural banks.  There  seems  to  be  rather vague but  mountingconcern  about  the  status  of  some  of  those  lenders.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  The  war between  the  forces  of the budget  andthe  trade balance  seems  to  have  moved  increasingly in  the  direction  ofthe  trade balance  prevailing, which pulls  the economy  down,  over  thestimulus  that  comes  from the  budget  deficit.  To  some  extent this  willcontinue,  as  net  exports  are  scheduled  in  our  forecast  to  becomeincreasingly  negative  for  several  more  quarters.  But  my  impression isthat  it  is  slowing  down.  On the  other  side,  of  course,  if we  succeedin  bringing the  budget  deficit  down,  that  expansionary forcediminishes  as  it  ought  to.  It  seems  to  me  that  there is  a  sort  ofstand-off  in the  economy  between these  two  forces.  And they  have  verydrastic  repercussions  on  various  sectors:  farmers,  some  parts  of  heavyindustry,  and the  import-competing  sectors.  So  this  is  not  a  staticsituation;  it  is  a  situation  full  of  great  tension.Given that  there  is  a  [pause],  as  it  were,  this  may  be  theopportunity to  do  something that  in  the  long  run  is  very  important:  totry to  reduce  the  structure  of  interest  rates--not  in  the  sense  ofstimulating the  economy  in  trying  to  accomplish  a short-run  objective,but  to  bring  interest  rates  down  over  time,  as  with  inflation.  If  Ithought  that  a  reduction  in  interest  rates  now would  have the  effectsimply  of a brief  stimulus,  I would  think that  could  be  a greatmistake.Let  me  look  for  a moment  at  the  mistakes  that we  might  fallinto.  We  have  always  leaned  toward  fine  tuning.  When  the  economy  isgoing down,  immediately  one  sees  what  one  could  do  by monetary  policyif one  doesn't  think  too  much  about the  long  lags.  Long  lags  have5/21/85-15-been  mentioned  and  I think they are  important.  What  we  do  now  in MayReserve  to  push  harder late  in the  cycle,  perhaps because  the  cycletends  to  peter  out,  the  natural forces  of  expansion  diminish.  It'sthe  nature  of  a business  cycle.  And  one  tries  hard  to  postpone theevil  day  and  push  back the moment  when the  economy flattens  out  sothat  we  do  not  have  to  go  into  recession.  One  stacks  up  problems,financial  problems  and  economic  problems,  for  the  future;  and  insteadof  a mild growth  recession,  one may get  a real  recession  a littlelater.  So,  I would not  press  very hard  to  keep  the  expansion  alive  ifwhat  it  wants  to  do  is  to  slow down.  But  that  does  not  seem  to me  avery  clear  description  of the  present  situation.  It  may be  more  of  alull  before  the  current account  ceases to  drag it  down  while budgetimprovement  and  lower  interest  rates  give  a certain  stimulation.Finally,  as  for  the  alternative  of  inflation and  unemployment,  I keeplooking  at  that  myself  and  I arrive  at  a somewhat  differentconclusion.  I think that  inflation  is  still  much above  where  it  oughtto  be.  And  I don't  see  it  coming  down  other  than in  a recession,which we want  to  avoid.  So  we  do  have to  do  something to  bring itdown  during a period  of  good  activity.  A 7.3  percent  unemployment  isnot  good and  2-1/2  percent  growth  also  isn't  very good.  I would  stillpay  a price  to  bring the  inflation down.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  is  that  price?

MR.  WALLICH.  Well,  2-1/2  percent  growth  for  a year  andacceptance  of  7.3  percent  unemployment.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I thought you  indicated  earlier  that  thatwasn't  going  to  bring  it  down,  but  I--

We  obviously  had  a slowing in  the  first  quarter  of  1985.In  the  fourth quarter  of  1984  we were  pretty well  paralleling  thenation  in  terms  of  economic  growth but  our  rate  of  increase hasslipped below the  pace  of  the  nation  in  the  first  quarter,  in  partbecause  of  absolutely declining  activity  in  energy,  electronics,  andconstruction.  Reference  already  has  been made to  office  buildingconstruction  and  that  sort  of  thing.  Of  course,  we  have  had an  awfullot  of construction  in  our  area  as  I've  reported  in  the  past.  Theproblems  in  Houston are  very  well  known;  they are  not  unforeseenproblems;  they  have  been trying to  live with their  problems  for  acouple  of years.  We  are  getting  reports  that  now there  is  concern  inAustin,  which has  been  a very  strong  boom area;  that  seems  to  beslowing very  significantly.  As  an  example,  based on  a recent  survey,we  had  about  18  million  square feet  of  office  space  sitting  empty  inDallas  in March--a vacancy  rate  of  a little  over  21  percent.  But  ontop  of that  in  March we had  another  25  million  square  feet  of  officespace under  construction.  The  conclusion of the  survey  was  that  we5/21/85-16-are  now approaching the  end  of  a  real  estate  cycle.  I think  I canaccept  that  statement.  Agriculture  remains  weak.  Our  preliminaryindication  on  our  latest  survey  of agricultural  land  prices  actuallyshowed  a little increase  in  1984  but  the  first  quarter now  isbeginning  to  show  a little decline.  So,  it  looks  as  though those whosaid  we  are  about  a year  to  a year  and  a half behind the  Midwest mightbe  right.Having  said  all  that,  I would  also  share  the view  expressedby  a few  others  regarding a little  concern about  overreacting  on theside  of  ease,  despite  all  the  gloomy  reports.  The  uncertainty  isvery,  very  great  and  I still  think  it  remains  to  be  seen which way  theeconomy  is  going to  turn.

MS.  SEGER.  I have  been  very  impressed with  the size  of thedownward  revision  in  the  official  staff  forecast  since  our  Humphrey-Hawkins FOMC meeting  in February.  That  shows  a far more  significantchange  than just  the  change  from the  March meeting to  this meeting.  Imust  say  that  I concur with those  downward  revisions  because  of  theproblems with  the  manufacturing  sector  of this  country  and  the  importcompetition.  The  fact  that  imports  are  hurting  not  just the  autoindustry  and  not  just  textiles  but  a broad  spectrum  of  companies  inmany, many  different  industries  really  depresses  me.  Also,  I see  thekinds  of  people who  are  aware  of  this:  individuals  I would  expect  tobe  unsophisticated  and  not  even know what  exchange  rates  are.  Butthey  are  tuned  in  to  the  super  dollar;  they also  are  tuned  into whyit's  super;  and  they know that  it  is  hitting them very  directly.  Ithink that  we  have  not  seen the  full  extent  of this  yet.Also,  I continue  to  be  very  concerned  about  the  fragilitiesof the  financial  system.  I got  on this  jag  early;  unfortunately,  ithas  been  going  on  since  '81  and  '82  and  I don't  see  it  getting better.I see  it  getting a lot  worse because  it  is  not  just  a couple  of  statesthat have  had  specific  problems,  namely local  depressions;  it  is  now alot  broader.  Unlike  Jerry,  I don't  think this  is  because  free marketsdon't  work.  I think the problems  with the  financial  system go  back topoor  public  policy  in  the  '70s:  namely,  a very  inflationary policythat  sent  bad  signals  to  financial  institutions  and  participants  infinancial  markets.  Then when  the  gears  were  shifted  and we  went  intoa more moderate  approach to  public policy,  i.e.,  fighting  inflationand  producing deflation  in  certain  sectors  of the  economy,  it  was  areal  adjustment  for  those people  to  make.  Also,  I think we  have to  becandid  and  say we  probably  have  not  regulated them  as  well  as  we  couldhave.  Supervision has  left  a lot  to  be  desired.  That  is  the messagethat  I think comes  through  from Ohio  and Maryland.  It  isn't  that  freefurther  that  if you  really  started  to  dig into  the  asset  portfolios  ofmany institutions  that  have  not  been  looked  at,  you're  going  to  find alot  of water  in there  to  squeeze out.  We  haven't  seen  it  all  yet.And  when that  squeezing takes  place,  I think we  are  going  to  see many,many more  insolvencies.  I am not  just  talking  about  thrifts;  I amtalking  about  banks.  This  is,  of  course,  a problem for  thoseinstitutions  themselves  but  I am more  and more worried  about how thatwill  impact  on  consumer  confidence  in  general  and  on businessconfidence--and  particularly how  it  will  impact  on  these little  townsin  rural  areas.  If  you want  to  have  some  fun,  go  back  and  read  about5/21/85-17-the  1920s  and  the  problems  in  the  agricultural  community  in  thatof the  country when the  problems with  farms  brought  down  farm banksand  the  result  was  tremendous  local  recessions  or  depressions.  Ithink this  is  one  thing we  have  to  take  very, very  seriously.Finally,  I just  want  to  mention that  I talked  to three  of thehighest  level  economists  in the  auto  industry  and  I'll  just  relay  toyou  a couple  comments  from them because  I think they  are  ratherinteresting.  In  general,  their  sales  forecasts  are  below what  we  aretalking  about.  One  is  using  10.5  million units  or  possibly  slightlyabove that  as  total  new  car  deliveries  for  calendar  year  1985.  Someof  the  sales  that  used  to  be  in  the  form of  autos  are  now going to  befor  small  trucks,  so  there  might be  a little more  in there;  they thinktruck  sales  will  be  about  4.5  million.  The  big  point  this  fellow madewas  that  it  takes  a lot  more  marketing money  to  move  cars.  In  otherwords,  consumers  are  not  coming  in  and  beating  the doors  down to  buy;they  are  having to  be  dragged  in  to  purchase.  Interest  rateincentives  are  being used  very  heavily.  The  customers  are  interestrate  sensitive,  and  the  special  promotional  rates  of  8.5  to  8.8percent  for  slow moving  cars  have  worked  to  move  those  specific  cars.Auto makers  are  putting those  incentives  on  some  other  cars--smallcars--because  they  want  to  help  their  "cafe"  ratings  with the  U.S.government.  The  penalties  are  going  to  be  severe  if they don'taverage  out  okay  for  this  year,  so  they want  to  move more  of thesefuel  economy  cars  to  help  that.  Another  chief economist  is  talkingabout  10.6  million deliveries  for  the  year  and  truck deliveries  of 4.4million.  But  again,  he  mentioned  this  interest  rate  incentive to  movenew  cars.  It  is  substantial.  He  said  that  the  going  regular  rate  fornew  car  loans  would  be  about  14.5  percent  and  they are  using  8.8percent  on  selected  lines.  The  third  fellow  says  that  the market  atthe  moment  is  the  strongest  in this  recovery  if you  just  look  at  salesvolume,  year-to-date.  According  to  his  numbers  they  are  coming  outwith  10.9 million  [currently]  but  for  the whole  year  he  still  thinksdeliveries  will  be  down  somewhere  around  10.6  to  10.7  million.  Andthey're having  to  buy  the  business.  He  said  the  incentives  providedon  some  of the  big  car  purchases  are  $2,000.  He  also  mentioned  thecompetition from imports,  such  as  Mercedes Benz,  on  the  big  car  lines,and  he  brought  up  the  matter  of  the  strong dollar.  In  his  view, wehave  not  seen the  full  impact  of the  rise  in  the  dollar  in  lower  autoprices  and,  therefore, they  have  a lot  of  room  to  cut  prices  if  theywant  to  go  after  sales  because  this  has  just  been  going  into  theirpockets  in  the  form  of  profits.  If  they  really wanted  to  go  aftersales  more  aggressively,  he thinks  they  could.  Anyway,  [theseeconomists]  are  not  complacent  about  the  economy  as  a whole  and  theysee  a slowdown  being  something that  would  cool  off their  numbers  stillmore.

[SECTION]

MR.  GARBARINI.  Since  my District  is  contiguous  in  small  partto  Mr.  Boykin's,  I'm  glad  that  they  have  found  they  are  at  the  end  ofthe  building  cycle.  We  have  had  space  for  lease  in  three of  ouroffices  for  some  time  and  have  found  that  the  overbuilding  in  thoseareas  was  recognized,  at  least  by  us,  somewhat  earlier.  Ourdiscussions with  business  folks  in  our  District  reinforce  some  of thecomments  Jerry made  about  their  lack  of  optimism and  what  Frank  saidabout  firms  giving  some  serious  consideration  to moving  manufacturingfacilities.  However,  I would  say  that  in  such  discussions  in  the  past5/21/85-18-generally those  folks  were  the  most  pessimistic  right  before thingsgot  a little  better.The  lack  of  any what might  be  called  "meaningful" growth  inthe  first  half  wasn't  too  much of  a surprise  to  us  and was  fairlyconsistent  with the  projections that  we  had made.  As  I recall,  at  theforecasts]  expressed  around this  table--we were  somewhat  of  an  outlierboth  on  real  output  and  inflation.  On  real  output we  were  1/2  to  3/4of  a point  [lower]  and  on  the  inflation  side  about  3/4  to  1 percentagepoint  higher.  For  the  second  half,  even though there  is  that  lack  ofoptimism in  the  business  community  in  our  District,  and  in  spite  ofthe  mitigating factors  such as  the  strength  in the  dollar,  I believethat  the  stimulation that  we  gave  to  the  economy in  the  last  half of1984  and  the  first  half of  this  year  and  the  impetus  of  current  ratesand  promise  of  a reduction  in  the  budget  deficit  could  give  usstronger  growth,  perhaps  even  above  that  3 percent  plus  level.  Iwould  echo  Bob  Black's  and Governor  Wallich's  comments  that  at  thispoint  in time  surely we  are  looking  at  uncertainty  but  not  a disaster,and  that keeping  our  eyes  on  our  long-term  goals  is  certainlyappropriate.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Let  me  focus  just briefly  on  the  Tenth Districteconomy.  The major  sectors  in that  economy are  agriculture,  energy--which  includes  both petroleum  and  mining  [unintelligible]--aircraft,auto,  and  high-tech, including  semiconductors.  In  that  array,  onlyone  is  doing  very  well  and  that's  the  automobile  industry.  Theremainder  are  all  in  a depressed  state.  In  agriculture the  situationis  basically  the  same  that  has  been  well  publicized  and  that we'vetalked  about  around  the table.  I would note  that,  based  on  theresults  of  a quarterly survey  just  completed,  the  land  values  in  theTenth District--that would  be  dry  land,  irrigated,  and  pasture  land--are  down  another  6 percent  from  the  end  of  1984.  In  the aggregate  forthe  District  as  a whole,  land  values  are  down  38  percent  from the  highof  1981.  Now, that means  that  in  some  of those  states  it's  down  30percent,  depending upon  the kind  of  agricultural  land,  and  in  somestates  it's  down  40  to  45  percent;  on  average,  it  is  down  38  percent.But  the  important  fact,  I think,  is  that  land  continues  to  drop  invalue,  showing  a 6 percent  decline  from the  end  of  1984.Energy,  both the  petroleum  and mining,  is  just  rocking alongwith  no  great  hope  of  any  resurgence  in  the  period  ahead.  Aircraftmanufacturers  just  can't  sell  commercial  or  private aircraft  overseasas  a result  of  the  dollar.  And with high interest  rates  and  theuncertainty  about  what  the  future  state  of the  tax law will  be,corporations  are  just  laying back  in  the  woods  and  not  committingthemselves  to  aircraft.  As  a result  the  industry  is  struggling.  Theauto  industry  in  the District,  which  is  a very  big employer  and  a bigcomponent  of the  economy,  is  going  full  out  and  that's  the  realpositive  aspect.  In the  high-tech  area,  which is  in  Kansas  City,essentially,  and  in New Mexico  and the  eastern  range  of  the  Rockies,we  find  that  the  competition  from overseas  together with the  [strengthof  the]  dollar  [has  put]  the  semiconductor part  of that  industry  atgreat  risk.  As  a matter of  fact,  we  had  the  second  closing of  a high-tech  firm in  Colorado  this  past week.  They  just  are  not  able  tocompete  with the  overseas markets.5/21/85-19-Having  said  all  that,  I would  like  to  turn momentarily to  thenational  economy.  I take  some  encouragement  from the  comments  thathave  come from  around the  table.  There  is  very  little  concern  about  arecession.  That  is  to  say,  the  staff's  forecast  of  2 to  3 percentgrowth  for  the year  as  a whole  suggests  that we  will  be  in thepositive  figures  and  perhaps  not  working  against  the high unemploymentrate.  Nonetheless,  there  is  no  concern  about  recession,  and  I findthat  true  in  talking to  people in  the  Tenth  District;  recession  is  noton  their  minds.  Our  staff,  looking at  the  outlook  for  the  periodahead,  would  forecast  just  a bit  more  expansion  in  the  second  andthird  quarters  than the Board  staff's  forecast,  but  on balance  wewould  come  out  for  the  year  as  a whole  about  where  the  Board  staffcomes  out,  with  slightly more  growth  in  the  latter  part  of  the  yearbecause  of the  interest  rate  action  that was  taken most  recently.There  are two  parts  to  that  expectation  of  a bit  more  expansion  thanin the  Board  staff's  forecast:  one  would  be  inventories  in the  secondquarter  and  the  other would  be  domestic  consumption  remaining verystrong  through the  second  and  third  quarters.  My  own view, however,would  be  a bit  more  optimistic than  the  Board's  staff or  even my  ownstaff.  Given  the money growth  in  late  1984  and  the early  part  of  thisyear,  I think the  chances  are  that  we will  see  some  real  strengthbeginning to  emerge  in the  third  quarter  and maybe  on  through theremainder  of  1985.Having  said all  that,  I also  have met with  the  small  businessand  agricultural  group  as  well  as  people  around the  District  and,clearly, the  focus  in  their minds  is  the  strength  of the  U.S.  dollar.That  touches  each  of  the  areas  that  I mentioned  that  the  TenthDistrict  is  involved  in.  It  is  becoming very  [apparent]  that  they  tiein the  federal  budget  deficit  with the  dollar and  they  see  that  astheir  enemy  at  the  moment.  The most  recent  decrease  in  the  interestrates  is  looked  upon very  favorably,  and  I should think the  reductionof the  discount  rate  will  fall  in  that  category.  I would  just  note,if  I heard the  Vice  Chairman  right that  he  could  not  [identify]  anyfinancial markets  that  didn't have  froth in  them, that  I can tell  youthat  the  agricultural  financial  markets  don't  have  froth  in  them.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  No  new froth.

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Well,  we  are  hearing  a lot  of  gloomy  reportstoday  and  that's understandable.  There  is  a lot  to be  gloomy  about.When  that  sort  of  thing happens  I think  it's  worthwhile  at  least  toremind  ourselves  that  there  are  some  positive  signs  developing.Housing  has  been moving up  for  four  or  five months  now.  I agree withJerry that  we  have  had  enough  reduction  in  interest  rates,  given thelag  in  the way  they affect  spending  and  credit  sensitive  sectors  ofthe  economy, that  we  should  expect to  see  some  results  from that  astime  goes  on.  I would  regard  auto  sales  as  a positive;  they may  godown but  they certainly  have  been  quite  strong  recently.  Consumersremain  quite  confident.  And  I take  some  comfort  in  the  fact  that,although investment  spending  intentions  for  1985  are  a lot  moresubdued  than they were  at  this  time  last year,  we  don't  seem to  haveseen  any  further  deterioration from the  fall  to  the  spring.  Thatrather  surprises  me,  but  maybe it  will  turn  out  that that  won't  holdup.  We  should  remind  ourselves  also,  I think, that  periods  ofslowdown  during  an economic  expansion  are  the  rule,  not  the  exception.If  I remember my  business  cycle history  correctly, Wesley Mitchell  andArthur  Burns used  to  talk  about  a mid-cycle  retardation,  which5/21/85-20-occurred about  3/4ths  of the  time.  The  problem  is  that  we  don't  knowwhether we  are  in  the  3/4ths  now or  in the  1/4th.  I am not  a wildoptimist  by  any  means.  I agree  with the  staff's  forecast  that  we  willhave  some  pickup  in  economic  activity.  I have  a hard  time  assessingwhether the  risks  are  a little  on  the  minus  or  the  plus  side,  but  Ithink  I would  assign  a probability  of  .001  to  an  outcome  of moregrowth  over  the  next  year  than  I would  be  comfortable  living with.Now,  I would  like  to  put  that  in  a longer-run  context.  Ithink we  ought  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that  what  we  are  lookingat  now is  an  economy that  is  being  severely  depressed by  competitionfrom the international  side.  It's  a consequence  of  a horrendousincrease in  the  value  of the  dollar  and the  dollar  is  eventually  goingto  decline.  When?  I don't  know whether  it  is  going to  be  next  weekor  next  month  or  next  year;  but when  the  dollar  goes  back down, wecould  find  the  economy  as  severely  stimulated  as  it  is  now beingdepressed.  And  if  that  occurs  in  the  context  of  a federal  structuralbudget  deficit  that  is  still  rising, we  are  in big  trouble.  That maynot  happen, but  I think  one has  to  remember that  the  problem we may beworried  about  on  average over the  next  three years  is  not  too  littlegrowth  but  too  much, and  not  too  little demand,  but  too  much.  We  needto  keep  that  in  mind  as  we  think about  the course  of monetary policyunder present  circumstances.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  Lyle  said  a good  deal  of what  I was  goingto  say.  This  has  been  such  a gloomy  go-around today that  I thoughtlistening to  everybody that  in the first  four months  of  the  yearnonfarm  payrolls  rose  by more than  1 million  workers.  That's  atremendous  rate  of addition  to  our  employment.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Want  to  be  gloomy?  Look  at  how  lousy thatmeans  productivity grew.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  we  don't  even measure  productivity  inservices  or  trade  and,  of course,  that  is where  the  employment  gainswere.  They weren't  in  manufacturing.  I think that we  tend  to  bebemused  by manufacturing, because historically  it  was  the cyclicallyvolatile  sector  and historically where we  thought we  got  our  oomph.And,  of  course,  we  are  not  getting any  now with the  importcompetition.  I agree  with  Lyle  that  that  is  a temporary  phenomenon,although  temporary  in  terms  of years,  perhaps,  rather  than months.But  we  really have  had  a very buoyant  domestic  economy  in  my view,with  the strength  being  sapped by  the  import  competition.  And  I thinkwe  ought  to  keep that  in  context.Now, I'm  as  concerned  as  anyone  here--even  Pres--about thecondition  of the  financial  markets.  I think that  they  are  in  terribleshape.  In  fact,  I can't  even  bring myself  anymore, Bob,  to  say whatyou  say  about the  banking  [system].  I don't  know that  it  is  sound  orthat  banks  are  in  good  condition.  I am  very much taken by  the  factthat  we  are  2-1/2  years  into  the  recovery  and  that  we  are  stilltalking  about  all  of these  problems.  We  have  a thousand  problembanks,  [the  ones  rated]  fours  and  fives.  We  have  failures movingalong  and  we  are  2-1/2  years  into  the  recovery.  What  happens  come  arecession--which will  come?  I don't  know.  There  may be  no  way  out  ofthis  box.  But  I do  believe that  the  worst  conceivable  thing thatcould  happen--the  thing  I have  nightmares  about--is  a situation that5/21/85-21-brings  about  the  necessity  of a  substantial  increase  in  interestrates.  By  substantial  I don't  mean  a point;  I mean  a  substantialincrease  in  interest  rates  because  of,  let's  say,  a very sharp  drop  inthe  dollar  or  a  sudden  strengthening  in  the economy  because  of  lessimport  competition  or  an  inflation  rate  that  accelerates.  I remindall  of  you that  all  the  research  shows  that  inflation  starts withprices,  not  wages.  And  then when  prices  move  up,  wages  follow.  Theywill  do  it  this  time  too--that  is,  if  we  have  another  rise  in  prices.But  an  increase  of  3 or  4 percentage  points  in  interest  rates  wouldabsolutely sink most  of  our  financial  institutions--certainly most  ofour thrifts  and  a  good many  of  our  other  financial  institutions.  So,I think  the  big  thing to  guard  against  is  getting  ourselves  into  asituation where  perforce  we  have  to  tolerate  or  accept,  and maybe  evenencourage,  a  substantial increase  in  interest  rates  six  months  fromnow,  a year  from now,  or  a year  and  a half  from now,  as  the  case maybe.So,  I find myself  a  little timid  on  this  business  ofstimulating the  economy  at  this  point  through  monetary  expansion.Some  fluctuation  in  rates  is  all  right,  certainly.  One  has  torecognize  that  we  are  not  anywhere  close  to  our  potential,  that  wevery  easily could  accommodate  in  the  near term more  growth  than  isforecast,  and  that  we  may  not  have  as  much  growth as  is  beingforecast,  because  quarter  after  quarter  we  have  had  shortfalls  in  ourprojections.  But  I wouldn't  want  to  do  that  in  any  kind  of  gung howay because  I think  that  would  raise  the  odds  that  a  subsequentsizable  fall  in  the dollar  and  a subsequent  increase  in  observedprices  would bring  higher  rates  that  would  give  us  really  seriousfinancial  troubles  in  our  system.  So,  I come  out  on  the  side  ofcaution  and moderation  in  what  we  do  today.

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Let  me  just  make  a  couple  of very briefcomments.  In  terms  of the  business  situation  and  outlook,  I myselfwould be  quite  surprised  if we  have  seen  the  end  of the  importpenetration  at  anything like  the  current  exchange  rate.  I think thatprocess  is  maybe  not  in midstream--it's  beyond  the midstream--but  weare  not  to  the  other  shore  by  a long  shot  in  my  own  appraisal.  Mr.Morris  expressed  a bit  of  surprise  at  the timing  of the  discount  ratechange.  I am  not  quite  sure  what  you had in  mind.  You may  have  hadin  mind the  timing relative  to  this meeting.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  was  a factor that  we  considered andwe  thought  on  balance  that  it  was  better to  get  it  out  of  the waybefore  the meeting--kind  of  as  a benchmark--rather  than  leaving  somequestion  as  to  how  it  would  fit  in  connection with  open  marketoperations.  I would  simply  say that  I did  not  have  in  mind  that  wewould  be  reversing  direction  of  that  action by  tightening  up  on  opencomment?5/21/85-22-

MR. MORRIS.  We  have  observed  in Boston that  the  only  thingin  the  economy that  is  very  strong  is  M1.  I have  distributed  to  allof  you  a chart  that  I thought was  rather  interesting  entitled  "SuperNOW Account Yields."  In  the  last  six  months  more  than  a third  of thegrowth of M1  has  been  in  Super  NOW  accounts.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  In  Super NOWs  as  opposed to  NOW  accounts?

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  Ten billion  dollars  out  of the  $26  billiongrowth  in  M1  has  been  in  Super  NOW  accounts.  In  the  prior  6 months,instead  of  growing  at  a $10  billion  rate,  they  grew at  less  than  $2billion.  I think  the  answer  to  why M1  exhibited  slow  growth in  themiddle  of the year  and very  rapid  growth  in  recent  months  is  shown  onthis  chart.  The  interest  rates  on  Super NOWs  as  administered  by thebanks  tend  to  be  rather  sluggish  relative to  market  rates.  When  rateswent  up  sharply  in  the  spring  and  summer,  the  opportunity  cost  ofholding  Super NOWs  relative to money  market mutual  funds  rosesubstantially,  so  we  had  a very  slow  rate  of  growth  in  Super  NOWs.  Asthe  opportunity  cost  dropped--there's  now only  a one  percentdifferential  and  I suspect  in  the  weeks  ahead  it  may drop  below theone  percent  level--you  would  expect  people to--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Before you say  that,  let  me  just  ask:  Aone  percent  differential  between what  and what?  That's  not  what  itlooks  like.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  The  difference  between the  [yields  on]  moneypoint.  In  the  original that  bottom  chart was  colored;  thedifferential  was  about  1 percentage  point  as  of April.  I suspect  nowit  is  probably  down lower  than that.  As  the  opportunity  cost  changesI think you would  expect  that  the  public's  willingness  to  hold  SuperNOWs  relative  to  money market  funds  would  change;  and  it  changes  inprecisely the  direction that  you would  expect.  So,  I think  thisexplains  a part  of  the  acceleration in  M1  growth--not  all  of  it,  but  apart  of  it.  It  also  raises  again  the  question that  I have  beenraising  for  several  years:  If  a large,  and  the  fastest  growing,component  of M1  is  paying  a rate  very  close  to  the  money market  mutualfunds  rate,  should  you  expect  the  aggregate  that  contains that  rapidlygrowing  component  to  behave the  same  way  as  it  has  in  the  past?  Quiteclearly,  it  seems  to  me, the  new M1  is  going  to  be  more  interestsensitive  than  the  old  M1  as  long  as  the  stickiness  of  the  Super NOWaccount  rate  persists;  and  the  relationship  between  the  new M1  and thenominal  GNP  is  going to  be  as  unpredictable  as  it  has  been  during  thepast  few years.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  It  all  sounds  very  plausible  to  me.  Iasked  a similar  question to  the  staff  recently and  they  told me therewas  nothing to  it,  so  I will  let  them  respond.  I may havemisinterpreted  their answer.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I think what  you're  observing  is  the  interestsensitivity of M1.  This  is  why the  models have  been  predicting  largegrowth  in M1.  This was  somewhat  of  a phenomenon  in  earlier periods.Part  of  the  growth of  the  Super NOWs,  of  course,  is  related  to  theswitching  out  of NOWs  when  the  minimum went  down  from  $2500  to  $1000at  the  beginning  of this  year.  But  if you  go  back for  six months,there has  been  a $10  or  $11  billion  increase  in  regular NOW  accounts,5/21/85-23-including  Super  NOWs,  so  that  they have  been--as  they have  been in  thepast--a  large  part  of the  increase  in  M1.  That  is  the  reason we  havebeen  contending that M1  cannot  have  the  same  degree  of weight  it  hadin  1979-1982.  There are  a lot  of  reasons  for that,  but  one  is  thatone  cannot  be  certain how  M1  velocity is  going  to  behave underdifferent circumstances.  I think  President Morris  rightly  points  outthat  the  interest  sensitivity has  increased with the  Super  NOWs  andNOWs  in  M1  and  the  sluggish  behavior  of their  rates  was  indeed  quite  aphenomenon in  1982  and  early  1983.  But  after  a while we  are not  surewhat  is  going to  happen to  that  interest  sensitivity.  If  theinstitutions  begin moving  their  rates  with  the market  rates,  then to  adegree  that  interest  sensitivity will  diminish.  Our  own uncertaintyin  that  respect  is  one  of  the  reasons  that we  are  a little  reluctantto  advocate  M1  strongly  at  this  point.  We  just  haven't  had  experiencein  varying kinds  of circumstances  as  we  go  through  all  of  thesetransitions.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  But  it  does  suggest  to  me  that with  rates  comingdown  and the  differential  narrowing,  if anything,  we  could  very wellsee  sustained  strong  growth  in M1.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  what  I asked  you,  [Mr.  Axilrod],explicitly the  other  day was:  Does  it  look  different  if you  look  atthe  old  M1  and  M1A?  You  told me  no,  but  this  would  seem to  imply  thatit  should  look  different.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  on  other  figures  they  don't  behavedifferently--the velocity behavior  and  the  growth  rates  behave  verysimilarly.  Give  me a  second  and  I can  round  those  figures  up  here.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  While  Mr.  Axilrod  is  looking,  I willgive  you  a sample  of  one.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  In  the  first  quarter,  growth  in M1  was  10-1/2percent  and  growth  in the  old  M1A was  6.8  percent.  In  the  secondquarter,  growth  in  M1--this  is  with  certain  assumptions--would bearound  6.7  percent  and M1A  would be  5.3  percent.  If  you look backsince  1981--omit the year  1981--in  1982,  1983,  and  1984  growth  in  M1Awas  running  anywhere  from 1-1/2  to  5 percentage  points  below growth  inM1.  So  the  relationships  that  have  emerged  in  the  first  and  secondquarters  are  not  that  different.  The  velocity  of M1A declined  0.3  ofa percent  in  the first  quarter  when velocity  of  M1 declined  about  0.4;in the  second  quarter  the  velocity  of  old M1A  was  about  unchanged,  ordown  a  little now  given  our  revisions,  and  it  was  down  0.2  percent  onold  M1.  So  they are  behaving  roughly  the  same.  But the  greatergrowth  in M1  relative  to M1A  is  a function  of the  greater  growth  inthe  NOW  account  component.  But  the  structural  relationship--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  were  the  fourth-quarter  figures?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Fourth  quarter  of  1984?  M1  grew  3.2  percentand  M1A  1.4  percent;  the  velocity  [growth rate]  was  around  3-3/4percent  for  M1  and  5-1/2  percent  for  M1A.  M1A  has  had  a steadilyhigher  velocity  [growth]  for  several  years  now.  The  reason  is  thatNOW  accounts have  low velocity  [growth].

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  There  is  another  way you  can  get  basically  thesame  conclusion.  One  of my  favorite  ways--nobody else  likes  it  but5/21/85-24-me,  I guess--is  to  look  at  those  old money demand functions  and  ask:What  would money have  done  if  the  relationship  between GNP  andinterest  rates  and  the  growth  of money had been what  it  used  to  be?If  you  do  that,  you  find  that  over the  past  year  the  predicted  growthof M1  on those  old  money demand models was  6.9  percent  compared withan  actual  of  6.2  percent;  for the  past  two  quarters  predicted  growthwas  7.0  percent  compared with  an  actual  of  6.8  percent.  I think thereally big  question  is  not  so  much whether money is  behaving in  apeculiar  way  relative  to  what  might have  happened  in the  past  if oldmoney demand models  prevailed,  but  rather whether money  growth has  thesame  kind  of meaning  when you have  an  exchange  rate  that  is  way, wayout  of  line.  We  used  to  think that money was  related to  aggregatedemand  not  to  output.  That  in  itself makes  a difference.  But  maybeeven  the  relationship between  money growth  and  aggregate  demand  is  notthe  same  in  a world  of wildly  volatile  and  fluctuating  exchange  rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  another thing  you can  look  at--thatthis  money  growth  may not  look  all  that  odd  compared  to  demand.[Unintelligible]  4 percent in  the  first  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Mr.  Chairman,  I did  ask  some  people to  runsome--Mr.  Garbarini  will  excuse  the  words  "simple-type"--simple-typeSt.  Louis  model  predictions  from M1.  That  had been  something wetested  back  in  1982-1983  to  see  if there  indeed  had  been  some  sort  ofdemand  shift.  In  that  period.  M1  had  been  predicting  a lot  highernominal  GNP  than actually  developed.  We were  in  a discussion withmonetarists  [unintelligible]  would be  needing, and  indeed the  nominalGNP  came  in  lower  than the  monetarist-type models would  predict.  M1Ain  those  days  was  not  predicting  so  badly  for  1983.  Now,  simplepredictions  on  M1  underpredicted  in  the  first half  of  1984  andoverpredicted in  the  second half.  Looking  into  1985,  they  wouldpredict  in  the  first  quarter a 9-1/2  percent  nominal  GNP,  which isalmost  3 points  or  so  higher  than we  got;  and  they  are  predictingdouble-digit nominal  GNP,  of  course,  in  the  second  and third  quarters.The  old M1A  is  also  predicting nominal GNP  higher than  our  staff ispredicting, although  not  as  high  as  the  M1.  So,  if  the  nominal  GNPcomes  out  about  as  our  staff predicts,  it  looks  as  if we  are  going  tosee  a pattern somewhat  similar to  what  happened  in  1983  in  terms  ofthese  predictions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  what  I conclude  from all  thisdiscussion  is  that  we  better have  a little more  orderly analysis  ofthis  before  the  next meeting when  we  have  to  look  at  those  [long-run]targets.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  We will  provide  some.

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  It  does  suggest  that  if M1  keeps  rising veryrapidly between  now and  July  that  we might  have  to  rebase  it  for  1985.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I think we  can  face that  issue  then.Meanwhile,  who  would  like to  make  a suggestion?  In  the  absence  of anyother  suggestions,  I will  make  a suggestion:  Keep  the  reservepressures  about  where  they  are.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  As  long  as  we  know where  they are.I will  make  a suggestion which  really does  involve  keeping  reservepressures  about  where  they  are.  In  terms  of the  monetary aggregate5/21/85-25-specifications,  I can  easily  live  with those  specified  in  alternativeB.  I personally would  shade  the  borrowings  level  a bit  higher  thanthe  staff's  suggestion  of  $300  to  $350  million.  This  is  reallysplitting  [hairs],  but  I would  rather  see  it  $350  to  $375  millionbecause  I think that  is  compatible  with  existing money marketconditions,  as  I understand them.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Now, what  are  you  doing with  the thrift[borrowings]?  Is  that--

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  The  thrifts  are  out  as  described  byMr.  Axilrod  in his  [briefing]  a few minutes  ago.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Totally  out,  Steve?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  that's what  I was  assuming.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  You  regard  them as  a functional  equivalent  ofextended  credit?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  The  Ohio  thrifts  are  on  extended  credit  and thebulk  of those  in the  Richmond  District  are  on  extended  credit  at  themoment.  Some  additional  ones  may be  put  on.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Oh,  is  that  right?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  We  would  be  glad  to  put  them all  in there,  if youwill  take  it  out  of that  figure,  because  it  is  like  extended  credit  onthose  that  [unintelligible]  for  a short  time;  [the  institutions  are]not  feeling the  adjustment  pressure  that  is  ordinarily felt  inadjustment  credit.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I would think you  could  [unintelligible]out  of  extended  credit  as  you do  out  of  adjustment  credit.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  The  rate  is  higher.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Those  institutions  are  under  somepressure.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Again,  I would  take  alternative  Bwith  borrowings  of  $350  to  $375  million.  We  have  this  awkward  problemof  having  set  monetary  growth paths  for  the  quarter  in  March that,especially  in the  case  of M2  and M3,  just  are  now so  far  out  of  linewith  what  we  were  talking  about  then  that  I think we  have  to  consider--although  no  one  likes  it--finessing the  language  of the  directive  toacknowledge that  situation at  least  as  it  pertains  to  M2  and  M3.  Ithink M1  we  can  finesse without  any  great  problems.  That's  aboutwhere  I am.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  You  are  prepared  to  accept  those  low M2  and M3numbers,  though?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  You  don't  think that  there  is  any  informationcontent  in  them?5/21/85-26-

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  I do  not.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Picking  up  on  Governor  Rice's  comments  withregard  to  the  economy  growing  under its  potential,  I would  certainlysubscribe  to  that  comment.  I don't  know whether  it's  3 or  3-1/2percent  or  more,  but  certainly  [2.7]  percent  and  a range  of  2 to  2-1/2percent  are  under  potential.  It  seems  to me, though,  that  thatquestion  is  properly  addressed  in  the  July  review  rather than  in  thisshort-run  situation we  face.  Secondly,  I would  like  to  address  thesuggestion  that  M1  be  brought  down to  the  band--I  think  it  was  theband,  not  the  cone.  I won't  get  too  methodical  with you here.  Itseems  to me  that  the  growth  in GNP  right  now  is  too  low, and  thatthere is  a downside  risk.  The  7.3  percent  potential  growth  rate  [forM1]  that  Steve  mentioned  earlier--if that  is  the  case for  the  year--Idon't  find  all  that  disturbing,  considering the  discussions  that wehave had with  regard to  V1. would take  a federal  funds  rate--what would  it  be:  8-1/2  or  9 cent?--to  bring M1  down  within that  band.  And  it  seems  to  me  that that  isnot  called  for  under these  circumstances.It  seems  to  me  that  in  the  usual  model  itAs  far  as  alternatives  are  concerned,  the  point  I was  tryingto make  by  reviewing the  horror  stories  that  unfortunately  are  realand  not  in  the movies  anymore  is  that  I think we  made  the correct movein  reducing  the  discount  rate  but  that  there  is  enough  speculativefever  out  there  that  if we  were  observed  doing anything  further  in  thedirection of  ease,  we  would  run  a risk that  I don't  believe  isnecessary of  aiding and  abetting  that  fever.  So  it  seems  to me  thatthis  is  a wonderful  time  for  the  Chairman--as  only the  Chairman  cando--to make  that  representation that  we  are  central  bankers  and we  areconcerned with  orderly markets  and  inflation  and  we  are  going  to  holdthe  line,  as  it  were.  That  gets me  certainly to  voting foralternative  B as  the  closest  thing to  the  status  quo  I can  read  out  oftoday's  confusing  events  and  the  description thereof.  If  the marketexpects  a nudge  further  in  the  direction  of  ease,  our  failure tosatisfy  that  expectation might  be  the  best  thing  we  could  do  rightnow, when  I feel  there  is  so  much  potential  panic  out  there.  As  faras  the  borrowing  is  concerned,  I go  along with Jerry's  suggestion  of$350-$375  million, partly because  I cannot  understand  how the  thrifts'borrowing  [fits],  and  secondly because  I don't  know how much borrowingwill  occur  as  unfortunate  events  unfold  and  how that  will  affect  theborrowing  level.  It  seems  to  me  that  results  in  a federal  funds  rate,perhaps  as  was  indicated, between  7-1/2  and  8 percent;  and  I thinkthat  is  appropriate in  terms  of market  pressures  and  the discount  ratereduction.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman, my wife  tells  me  I'm hard  to  pleaseand  if  she  were here  today  she  would  say  that my  actions  would  provethat  because  I don't  like  any  of  the  alternatives.  I am mindful  ofthe  risks  involved  in  this,  but  all  of  these  alternatives would  put  usabove  the  upper band  and  also  above  the  upper  cone  for  M1.  And  I justdon't  think  anything would  be  gained  by  pushing M1  above  the  long-runtarget  range;  on the  contrary,  I think we  have  a lot  to  lose.  Thefinancial  market participants  are  well  aware  of  these  parallel bandsand  if  they  see  us  running  short-run  targets  above  those bands,  Ithink they  are  going to  question  our  anti-inflationary  resolve.Therefore,  I couldn't  accept  anything  above  5-1/2  percent,  which wouldput  us  about  at  the  top  of  the  band.  Actually  I prefer  5 percent,which would  give  us  a little  breathing  room.  I don't  know what  kind5/21/85-27-of federal  funds  rate  it  would  take  to  do  that--it  might  take  a littlebit  of  an  uptick  from where we  are now--maybe  where we  were  rightbefore  the  discount  rate was  cut.  But  if  that had  to  be,  I wouldrather  see  that than  encounter the  kind  of  scenario  that  Chuckoutlined  earlier, where  later  we  find that  we  were  wrong and have  topush  it  up  still more.  And  if an  increase  is  necessary,  I think thatmight be  some indication that  the  economy  is  really  stronger than theGreenbook  suggests.On  this matter  of  not  changing  policy:  If  the  Committee  doesadopt  alternative  B,  as  I suppose  it  will,  I think most  people  wouldregard  that  as  a clear  easing  of the  short-run policy  stance  that  weadopted  at  the March meeting.  Now, there  is  nothing  in  the  directivelanguage  to  indicate  that  any  easing has  occurred  but we have  taken asmall  step  in  that  way.  And  in  particular the term  "maintain" in thefirst  sentence  of  alternative B would  be  somewhat confusing.  Irecognize  the  system we  use  and  that  the  term  "degree of  reservepressures"  refers  to  the  level  of borrowing.  But  I don't  think thatthe  outside world  looks  at  it  quite that  narrowly,  so  they might  notunderstand  it. address  if  we  go  with  "B" as  I would  guess  the Committee  probably  isgoing  to  do.So,  I think that's  at  least  a question  we  ought to

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  I would  just  like  to  respond  very briefly  to  someof the  observations  that  have  been made.  First,  if  I thought  we  werefacing  an  inflation  rate  of  5 percent,  I certainly would  be  much moreconcerned  and that  would  be  reflected  in  my view  of  appropriate  policyin  that  I'd  probably want  to  be  more  restrictive.  I don't  think weare.  Secondly,  if  I thought we  could  get  the  inflation  rate  downunder  2 percent  by  keeping the  economy  growing at  2 percent  and  theunemployment  rate  at  7.3  percent,  I would be  willing  to  do  that  too.I would  be willing  to  pay  that  price, but  I don't  think we  can  getinflation down  below 2 percent by  holding the  economy down  at  such  alow rate  of  growth.  I don't  see  any  beneficial  effects  to  be  achievedfrom  such  a slow  stagnating  rate  of  growth  and  that  is  why  I said  thatwe  ought  not  to  be  satisfied  with  anything  less  than  3 to  3-1/2percent.  Having  said  that,  I would  favor alternative  B with  a tilttoward  "A." a little below Jerry's  recommendation  and more  in  accord with theborrowing  that  we  would  expect to  be  compatible  with  alternative  B--inthe  $300  to  $350  million range.By that  I mean that  I would  be  willing to  relax borrowing

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Well,  I do  think we  are  probably at  a time  wheremaintaining the  existing  degree  of  reserve  pressure  is  appropriate.  Iam  a little  unclear  as  to whether  that  is  "B" or  "C" at  this  point.  Iam  a bit  uncertain  about  the thrift  aspect  of the borrowing  level,  soI think  I would  favor  alternative B.  If  I were  going  to  vary fromthat,  I would  have  a slight tendency  toward  "C,"  which maybe  suggestsraising the  borrowing  level  a bit  from  the  earlier  recommendations  tothe  area  of  $400 million.  That  seems  to  me  probably  about  where weare,  adjusting  for  the  thrift  borrowing.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  I earlier indicated  that  I think we haveto  be  thinking about  where we  are  going  over  the  longer  run  into  dump  in  reserves  in  buckets.  We  shouldn't  act  panicky.  Weshouldn't  let  rates  drop  a ton.  We  should be  ready  to  take  backwhatever additional  stimulus  we  put  in  now, if  it  turns  out  that  the5/21/85-28-economy  gets  a bit  more  robust  as  the  year  goes  along than we  now  areforecasting.  I do  think that  what we  need  to worry  about most  withrespect  to  M1  is  not  so  much how  fast  it  is  presently  growing,  butwhether  or  not  there  is  going  to  be  an  impression  out there  that  theFed  is  throwing in  the  towel  on inflation.  If  that  impression werewidespread,  I would  be  deeply  concerned.  I don't  sense that  now  and  Ido  want  to  make  sure  that  we  don't  give  that  impression.  But  I amperfectly happy  to  go  along with the  specifications  of  "B"  and theborrowing  range  specified  by  Jerry  of  $350  to  $375  million.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  Just  a word  on  this  matter  of M1  showing  growthabove  the band:  I think we're  all  aware  of the  fact  that there  hasbeen  a change in  the pattern  of  velocity  here,  probably  stemming fromderegulation and  what  that  has  done to  the  interest  elasticity  of  thedemand  for money.  In  any  event,  our  staff  felt  at  the  time  of  ourSo  that  influences my view  of what  the  appropriate  growth  rate  of M1is.  Because  of  that  decline  in  velocity that  seems  to  be  going on,I'm not  concerned  that  we  are  courting  inflation or  a reigniting  ofinflation  in  the near  term.With respect  to  the  specifications,  I would  be  in  favor  ofthe  federal  funds  rate  associated  with alternative  B of  about  7-3/4percent  and  borrowing  in  the neighborhood  of  $300  to  $350  million.The  San  Francisco money model,  given  those  and  other  inputs,  wouldexpect  the  growth  rate  of  M1  to  be more  like  that  shown  in  alternativeA.  If  it  were  7 percent  or  a bit  higher,  that would  be  all  right withme  in view  of  the  losses  in  the economy  and  the  view  I expressedearlier  today  about  tilting  in the  direction  of  ease  until  we  get  somebetter  balance  back in  the  economy.  So,  as  I mentioned,  I would  favoralternative  B.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Given the  sluggishness  of  the  economy  and  thefact  that  inflation is  at  a moderate  rate  and the  dollar--in  spite  ofits  recent  declines--is  still  at  high  levels,  I think the  Committeeshould  appropriately  confirm or  ratify the  accommodative  stance  thathas  been taken  over  the last  couple  of weeks.  I'm  not  particularlydisturbed about  M1  being  over  its  band  at  the  present  time,  given  therelative weakness  of the broader  aggregates  and what  I sense  is  goingto  be  a continued weakness  in  the  second  quarter.  So  I would  think,Mr.  Chairman,  that  we  ought  to maintain  the  current  reserve  pressures,if  "pressures"  if  the  right  word  to  use  at  this  point.  I would  optfor  alternative B with  the borrowing  specification  given  in  theBluebook which would  translate  in  my mind to  a federal  funds  rate  ofabout  7-3/4  or  7-1/2  percent.

MR.  STERN.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I generally would  supportalternative  B.  I must  admit  to  being  a little  concerned aboutselecting a target  that  leaves M1  above  its  channel.  But  it  seems  tome that  at  this  point  in  time  that  is  a relatively  low-cost  insurancepolicy,  if you will,  that may  at  the margin  help  economic  performance.5/21/85That  seems  appropriate  to  me  under the circumstances  and, therefore,  Idon't  have  any  problems with the  general  specifications  of B.  I don'thave  a conviction on  the borrowing  level,  in  part  because  of  some  ofthe  noise that's  affecting those  numbers.  But  it  seems  to  me thatappropriate under  the  circumstances.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Morris.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I think  last  week was  anhistoric  week  in the  evolution  of the  thinking  of the  Federal  Reserve.On  Thursday we  announced a  $2-1/2  billion  rise  in M1  and  on  Friday  weannounced a discount  rate  cut,  which  shows  that  we're  really  learningfrom  experience.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Or  that  we  didn't  know what  the money  supplywas.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  As  I read  the  numbers,  it's  clear  to  me  that  theU.S.  economy--and  I think  the world  economy--needs  a lower  level  ofinterest  rates  in  the  United  States  to  the  extent that  that  can  beproduced  without  jeopardizing  our  determination  to  control  inflation.It  seems  to  me,  therefore,  that  it's  appropriate  for  us  to  probe  alittle  on  interest  rates.  I'm not  completely persuaded  that  what  hashappened  already  will  be  enough.  But  I think  we  ought  to  sit  back andassess  things  before we  move  any  further.  So,  I would  support  "B"with  Jerry  Corrigan's  $350-$375 million  on  borrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I favor  alternative B,  but  I think we  ought  torecognize that  alternative  B in  the  context  of  a 7-1/2  percentdiscount  rate  is  an  easier  policy  than  in the  context  of  an  8 percentdiscount  rate.  I think  it's  technically  correct  to  say  that  we'remaintaining the  same  policy.  But  for  the world  at  large  that's  onlygoing to  be  a technicality.  I would think we would  be  better  off  inthe  wording  to  use  the  words  "maintain the  existing  degree  of  pressureon  reserve  positions"  but  that  we might  add  the  phrase  "in  the  contextof  the  recent  decline  in  the  discount  rate."  Otherwise,  I think we'regoing to  let  something that  is  technically  correct  in  a very narrowsense  lead us  into  a  communication  problem.  The  other  point  is  thatthe  M1  specification  of  6-3/4  percent  strikes  me  as  being  overlyprecise;  perhaps  we  ought  to  round that  to  something  that  looks  alittle more  even,  like  7 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I have  some  sympathy with Bob  Black'sposition.  It  makes  me  uneasy  to  be  running  above  track  on  M1.There's  no  magic  in  it,  of  course.  But  we  specified  it  and  it  is  arelatively  high  number  historically.  We're  at  the  time  in the  cyclewhen  it's  conceivable  that we're  seeing weaknesses  here  and  there  thatcould  do  the kind  of  thing  that would  lead  people  to  say,  as  they  doabout  the  '70s,  that  we  acted  in  an  inflationary manner.  It  is  asensitive  time  to  overrun  the  objectives  that we  have  set  before.  Iam  impressed, however,  by  the  fact  that  the  M1  target  ranges were  setin  the  context  of  a higher  interest  rate  structure  than we  now  have.And  interest  rates,  as  Frank  has  pointed  out,  do  now very much  affect5/21/85-30-the  behavior  of M1.  So,  that  may be  somewhat  of  a temporaryexplanation at  least.  I think we  need  to  review this  all  quitethoroughly  for  the  next meeting, including what  NOW accounts  aredoing,  particularly Super  NOWs.  You  remember when the  minimums  werereduced  on  all  of them  in  January that  we  said  we were  going  to watchcarefully to  see  what  happened.  I'm not  sure  that  we  have  watchedthat  carefully  since  then, having  decided that  nothing was  going  tohappen.  So  that  all  ought  to  be  reviewed.  I'm  also  impressed  by  theextreme  weakness  in M2  and  M3.  I've  asked  about  that  several  timesand  I'm  always  told  that  it's  a technical  thing that  will  soon  reverseitself.  But,  in  fact,  if  you look  at  the  family  of  aggregates--andyou  remember that  the  Committee has  a family  of  aggregates  so  that  itwon't  be misled  by  some  exotic  movement  in  one  of them--we're  inpretty  good  shape.  M2  and  M3  have  declined  down  not  only within  theparallel  lines  but  are  now within the  cones.  And  seeing that  gives  mea little more  comfort.  So,  I would accept  alternative  B.  And  if  Iwere  going  to  err,  I'd  err  on  the  side  of tightness  rather than  ease.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I just  wonder whether  the  weakness  in  M2  and  M3is--and  we  saw  this  at  the  same time  last  year--an  IRA  accountphenomenon.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  it  could  be  that.  It  could  be  theTreasury  refund  situation  and the  big Treasury balance.  I think wejust  have  to  look  at  it.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  as  I recall,  didn't we  have  a similar kindof weakness  last  spring,  Steve?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Not  that  dramatic.  If  you  put  in  all  of theIRA  increase  seasonally  unadjusted, that  would  add  4 percentage  pointsto  the  growth rate.  And  assuming that  our  seasonal  on  thenontransactions  component--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  4 percentage  points  for  one  month?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  at  an  annual  rate,  for  one month.  If  youassume  that  our  seasonal  on  the  nontransactions  component  caught  atleast  half  of  that--which  strikes  me  as  a reasonable  assumption--you'dadd  a couple of  points,  which  would  leave  growth  still  very  weak.You'd  need  other  explanations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  These  M2  and  M3  numbers  are  quite  lowhowever you  look  at  them.  If  they were  really that  low for  thequarter,  I'd worry  a bit.  It  allows  much  room  for  increases.  Mrs.Horn.

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I'd  like to  show  some  progress  inmoving the  monetary aggregates--M1  in  particular--toward where we  wantto  be  at  year-end.  Because  of the uncertainties  in  the  economy andthe  uncertainties with  respect  to  velocity, where  I personally wouldlike  to  come  out  at  year-end  is  in the  top  part  of  the  ranges,particularly for  M1.  I'm not  in  favor  of bringing  it  back too  fastfor  a number of  reasons,  including the  uncertainties.  But  I'm  alsonot  sure  it's  the  appropriate  time to  be  active  on  the  other  sideeither.  So,  I would  favor  alternative  C, but  I would  favor  changingthe  borrowing number upward  slowly  as  things  develop.5/21/85-31-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I would  favor  theaggregates  specifications  of  alternative B.  It  doesn't  bother megreatly  that we  are  at,  or  near,  or  above the  top  of the  parallel  line[for  M1],  given  the weakness  we've  had.  I think  it's  an  appropriateresponse, with  the  velocity  [growth]  being  negative  for  what wouldappear to  be  two  quarters.  But  what  I am bothered  about  is  theborrowing  level  suggested  in  the  Bluebook:  the  $300  to  $350  millionrange,  which will  achieve  a 7-3/4  percent  federal  funds  rate.  If  I'mcorrect  in  my thinking  about  that,  if we  maintain  the  same  pressureson  reserves  that  we've  had  in  the  past  and  have  dropped  the  discountrate  1/2  percentage  point,  then that  would suggest  that  in  order toget  a funds  rate  of  7-3/4  percent  we  would need  to  have  the  sameborrowing  level  that we  had  before we  dropped the  discount  rate.  Andif  I understand  the numbers  right,  that  level  is  closer  to  $400million than  it  is  to  $300  to  $350  million.  I think borrowingaveraged  $380 million  over  the  intermeeting  period.  The point  thatI'd  like to  make  is  that  $300  to  $350  million  seems  a little  low  and  Iwould be  a little more  cautious  so  as  to  get  to  the  7-3/4  percent  overtime.  As  a result,  I would  opt  for  a borrowing  level  of  $375  to  $425million with  a target,  obviously,  of $400  million  starting  out.  And  Ishould  think that  if we're  looking  ultimately to move  to  7-3/4  percentthat  we  can  do  it  gradually.The  other  point  that  I would  make,  and  I've  made  it  before,is  that  seasonal  borrowings  are  now running  about  $170  million, whichis  half  of the  $300  to  $350  million, and  they will  continue  to  buildover  the upcoming intermeeting period.  Therefore,  with  a $300-$350million borrowing  objective,  we're  really  getting very  close  toturning  loose  and  actually  pegging  the federal  funds  rate,  which  Iwould  oppose.  Therefore,  I would  accept  "B" and  recommend  a borrowingrange  of  $375  to  $425  million,  centering  on  $400 million  for  the  startof  the  intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Ms.  Seger.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  As  I reviewed  the table  here  and  the  charts  onthe  various  monetary aggregates,  it  seemed to  me  that  what  I saw forM2  and  M3  was,  as  Chuck  said, that  as  of April we  were  already  notonly within  the  parallel  lines  but within  the  cones.  Also,  as  I lookat  where  the various  alternatives  A, B, and  C are  plotted  for  the  endof  the  quarter,  they  are  not  really that  far  apart.  They  are  withinthe  cones  at  that  point.  For M1  I see  that  as  of April  we're  a touchabove  but with  each alternative--A, B, or  C--we  are  going to  be  abovethe  parallel  line.  So  if we're  concerned  about  how  the  financialthan  about  a nickel's  worth of difference.  I don't  think that  theyjust  look  at  M1  to  begin with;  and  secondly,  I don't think that  theywould  be  that  sensitive to  these  short-range  positions we  are  taking.So  I guess  I could practically  roll  the  dice  here  and  say  that  ifeveryone  is  going with  alternative  B, I certainly  can.  But  I hope  ifthere  is  a way  to  lean  that we  would  lean  toward alternative  A ratherthan  toward  tightening,  particularly  because  I think we  have  to  bevery  careful  about  what  our  actions  do  to the  fed  funds  rate  and whatmessage  that  sends  to  market  participants  about  what  we  did  today.  Interms  of the borrowing  target,  frankly,  I'm  so  confused  about  how thethrift  numbers  come  in  here  that  I really  don't  know  exactly what5/21/85-32-number to  pick  up.  But  I think  I would  rather  have  it  lower  thanhigher,  which  is  a very vague way  to  put  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Garbarini.

[SECTION]

MR.  GARBARINI.  Mr.  Chairman,  I strongly  endorse  yourrecommendation  that monetary  policy be  consistent  with what  we've  beendoing recently.  I'm  concerned  that,  while monetary  policy might  workwith  lags,  monetary messages work  somewhat  quicker.  And  it  seems  tome  that  anything  other  than  "C"  gives  a message  of  a move  toward  ease.If we  had to  go  with  "B,"  I'd  agree  with Roger that  at  least we  shouldincrease the borrowing  level.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I wonder,  Paul,  whether  the staff  has  any viewon  this  seasonal  borrowing  point  that  Roger made.  I had  sort  offorgotten  about  the fact  that  it  would be  moving up--I  presumesignificantly--in weeks  to  come.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  it  may.  It  looks  like  it  would tend  torise  a little  in May naturally,  although  in  1984  the  spread betweenthe  funds  rate  and the  discount  rate  was  about  the  same  as  in  April--between  the  funds  rate  and  the discount  rate  is  unchanged, that  itprobably would  be  running,  say,  $30  or  $40  million  or  so  or  maybe  alittle  more  above what  is  "normal"  for  seasonal  borrowing  given thisspread  and  this  time  of year.  So,  implicitly, the  $350  million wasallowing  for that.  And  that  probably would  give  you  a funds  rate  of7-3/4  percent  shaded on  the down  side  I would  guess  rather  than  shadedabove.  I don't  know if Mr.  Sternlight  agrees  or  disagrees  with that.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  No,  I'd  agree  with  that--shaded to  the downside.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Boykin.

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  I would  find  alternative B  acceptable.  In  myview  the  borrowing  assumption  as  a minimum  should be  $350  to  $375million.  I would  not  go  below that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Governor  Wallich hasn't  been  heard  from.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Well,  as  I said  before, the  chief monetaryobjective  that  I envisage  is  to  overcome  the  stickiness  of the  long-term rate  and to  bring  about  more  reasonable  real  long-term  rates.This  can be  done  by  steepening  the  yield  curve--that  is  pulling theshort-term  rate  down--provided that  it  doesn't  lead  to  an  excessiveacceleration  of M1  or  the  other  aggregates.  Fortunately,  that  seemsto  be  what  is  happening now,  so  our  range  of  maneuver  is  very  limited.We  have  already  reduced  the  funds  rate,  the  short-term  end  of theyield  spectrum.  And  I think  we've  probably  done  as  much as  we  dareright  now.  One  has  to  observe  what  the  market  does.  If  the marketaccepts  it  and  brings  down  the  long-term  end  so  that  the  yield  curvedoesn't  steepen,  well,  then  one has  made  a step  forward  and  oneshouldn't  take  any  risks  of the market  rejecting the maneuver.  Inpractical  terms  I'm  concerned  also  by  how quickly  one moves  from thecone  to  the  band.  The  main virtue  of the band  that  I see  is  that  itseems  to  give  us  in writing  a lot  of  leeway;  it  doesn't  matter  whetherthe money  supply  overshoots  quite  sharply in  the  short  run;  we  don't5/21/85-33-have  to  bring  it  back  immediately.  But  other  than  that,  the band  isnot  a good  guide.  It's  the  cone  that  is  the  right  guide.  So  giventhe  constraints,  I can  go  with  "B"  and  I can  go  with  $350-$375  millionon  the borrowing and  a funds  rate  to  match,  which would  be  7-3/4percent  or  a little more  perhaps.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  I'd  just  make  one  quick technicalcomment  on  M2.  In  March  and  especially  in  April there  has  been a verysubstantial  runoff  of RPs,  which we  think is  associated  with theanomaly  of the  Treasury balance  and  the  refund problem.  That  itselfis  a major  factor  in  terms  of  abnormally  slow  growth  of  M2  in  thisperiod.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  I think that's  right.  But  I'm hearing  alsothat April  was  the lowest  M2  growth  since  1970.  That  goes  back a longway.  It  may be  strictly technical,  but  it  gives  me  pause  so  long  as  Isee  it  there.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  I agree.  But  the  runoff  of  RPs,Peter,  was  how much  in  April?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  I think  that was  the main  factor  in  theweakness  in M2  but  I don't  know how many  percentage  points.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  It  was  big  dollars.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  One  of  the  things  is  that  thrifts  are  getting tobe  a part  of these  numbers  and we  know that  FCA is  still  in trouble.And  as  a matter  of  fact  the  whole  savings  and  loan  industry  seems  tobe  much  less  aggressive  in  terms  of  expansion--I  guess  because  of  theHome  Loan Bank Board  rule  on  incremental net  capital.  So  I'mwondering  whether there might  be  something more  there.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  may well  be.  It's  probably undulyoptimistic  to  think that  they  decided  not  to  make  so  many  bad  loans.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  No,  they're  going  to  make  as  many bad  loans  butthey're  going  to  make  fewer  good  ones!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Mr.  Chairman, there  seems  to  be  somemisunderstanding  as  to  what  the  level  of borrowing  is  that  we  setforth with  respect  to  the  different  alternatives,  especially with  "B."I would  ask  Steve--and  I think the  rest  of you might  be  interested  inthe  answer--whether, as  I understood  it,  the  level  of borrowing he  wastalking  about  in the Bluebook assumed  that  all the  so-called  specialsituation borrowing with  respect  to  thrifts  would be  treated  as  otherextended  credit.  So,  that  is  not  as  fluky  a number or  asunpredictable  a number as  it  might  otherwise be.  That  is  theunderstanding, is  it  not?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  that's  how we  wrote  the Bluebook.  Ithink what's unpredictable,  essentially, is  the  relationship  [ofborrowing]  to  the  funds  rate.  There  has  been a lot  of  looseness  inthat  relationship.  And  I don't  think  any of us  can  guarantee  anyparticular  funds  rate  for  any  particular  level  of borrowing.  We  canguarantee  sort  of  an  area,  but  not  any  particular  level.5/21/85-34-

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  As  a  follow-up  on  that:  Your  $380 millionborrowing  level  that  you  averaged  out  over  the period  excludedeverything,  right?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  I excluded  it.  That's  right;  I took  out  all  ofthe  special  situation borrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Which  is  clearly  wrong  at  the  extreme,  itseems  to  me.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  In  the  same  sense  that  it  was  wrong  to  take  outall  the  borrowing  by  Continental  last  summer.  Some  fraction  probablyshould  have  been  left  in  there;  I assume  that  some  of  it  was  notextended  credit.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Small  or  large.  Well,  there's  no  greatdesire  to  change things  aggressively.  That  is  a point  with  which  Iagree,  but  let  me  just  make  a couple of  supplementary  comments.  Idon't  know where we  are  on  the  economy;  it's  not  looking  very  good.  Ido  know the  exchange  rate  is  awfully  high  and  I surely wouldn't  wantto  push it  higher.  I would  rather  do  the  reverse.  I don't  know whatis  going  on  with M1  or  M2  or  M3.  I know they  are  giving  out  differentsignals,  but  I don't  feel  very  religious  about M1  at  this  point.  Ifthe  economy  shows  further  signs  of  softening  and  the dollar  is  goinghigher  and  financial  strains  in  a number  of  directions  continue  or  getaggravated,  as  they well  might,  I think we're  running  some  financial[risks]  in  the  financial  system, clearly.  There  are  financial  strainsacross  a large  part  of  the  structure  of the  American manufacturingindustry at  least.  One  is  partly  related to  the  other.  And  I thinkwe  have to  maintain  some  flexibility on  the  easier  side,  although  Iwouldn't  [move  in  that  direction]  right  now.  I think that's  a muchmore  likely  hypothesis  than  the  opposite,  although  I don't  mindmaintaining  flexibility  on  the  opposite  side  either.  This  alternativeB/alternative  C business  never  appears  in  anything  [we  publish];  maybewe  ought  to  look  at  the  [draft]  directive  language,  which  I don't  likemuch  in  the  sense  that  it  doesn't  change  anything  from last  time.There  have  been  a number  of  comments  that  we  ought  to  mention  thediscount  rate  someplace.  I think  that  would  be  wise.  Let's  putsomething  in the  first  sentence  there.  I'm not  quite  sure  why wewould say  "uncertainties  in the  business  outlook."  It  seems  to  mewhat  we  ought  to  be  saying  is  "relatively  slow  growth."

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  We  can't  really  say  "taking  accountof  progress  against  inflation"  anymore  either.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  long  term.  Another  thing  on theinflation  front,  as  we  said  in  our  announcement  [about  the  discountrate],  is  that  the  commodity  prices  are  just  continuing  to  fall.  Theaverages  for  the  most  part,  except  for  the  very  low level  at  thebottom  of  the  recession,  are  as  low as  they  have  been  in  two  years  andthe  level  is  about where  it  was  in  '79  or  '80.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Yes.5/21/85-35-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  a real  reduction  in  commodityprices  of  30  or  40  percent,  I suppose.  And  it's  just  about  across  theboard:  in  agricultural  prices,  industrial, mining--

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  That's  another  reason why  it'sdisturbing  that  the  general  price  level  is  rising  as  much as  it  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it's  rising  and  it's  mainly  in theprices  of services.  But  there has  been  a  little bulge  in  gasolineprices  recently,  which  we may  have  for  another month  in  thestatistics,  but  that  seems  to  be  over  in  the  commodities  prices.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Car  prices.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Car  prices  went  down  last  month.

MR. MARTIN.  The  Japanese  premium ought  to  start  coming in.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I just  read  it.  Used  car  priceswere  down  slightly  and  the  new car  prices  were  unchanged.  It's  a rarething  for  used  car  prices to  come  down.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It's  all  those  trade-ins,  with this  high  levelof new  sales.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  the  easy thing  to  do,  and maybe  it'ssufficient,  is  just  to  mention  in  the  first  sentence that  the  discountrate went  down.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  there  are  three  items  mentioned--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Let  me  suggest  something  radical:  take  outall  this  business  about  progress  against  inflation,  uncertainties,  andthe  exchange  value  of the  dollar.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  they  really are  all  very difficult.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Say:  "In  the  implementation  of policy  forthe  immediate  future,  against  the  background  of the  recent  decline  inthe  discount  rate."  We  mentioned  all  these  things  [in  ourannouncement  of the  discount  rate  action.]  Put  a footnote  on  it  thatsays  "See  the  statement  on  the--"

MR.  BALLES.  How  about  "the  recent"?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  "The  recent"?  Borrowing  is  going  to  bevery high  this  week isn't  it?  How  about  "in  the  period"?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  yes,  with  this  particular week'ssituation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  [Mr.  Axilrod,]  you had  a rather  selectiverecitation,  I think,  of the  average  borrowing.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  No,  no.  It's  going  to be  high  with the--

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Just  yesterday  there were--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It  was  high  with  all  the  thrifts  in.  They  arenot  all  in  extended  credit  yet.  So  we're  running  high with them  in.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  That  would  only take  out  about  $200  millionin  the  period average.  I would  say  that  what  we'll  publish  this  weekwill  be  high because  most  of  them are  in.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  going to  be  high without  all  thethrifts,  isn't  it?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  I calculated  that  average--

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  My  feeling  is  that  without  thrifts  thisperiod's  average will  be  at  something like  $600  million.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  We  could  still  get  some  borrowing  in  New Yorktoday.high.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  For  the  period,  but  the week will  be  a little

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Did  you  say  $600  million without  the  thrifts?

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  Yes,  that's  high.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I guess  "recent"  is  better  than  "existing"in that  connection.  When  I say  it,  it  doesn't  sound  very  good;  but  Iguess  "recent"  is  better  than  "existing."

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Maybe you  could  say  "prevailed  over  recentweeks"  or  something.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "In  most  recent  weeks."

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  "Selected  recent  weeks"!

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  "As  interpreted  in  recent  weeks"?5/21/85

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know.  The  more we  try  to  explainit  the more  difficulty we  get  in.  "The  Committee  seeks  to maintainabout  the  same  degree  of  pressure  on  bank  reserve  positions."  Let'sgo  on  to the  next  sentence,  having  resolved that  one.  I think thisbracketed  suggestion may  be  better;  what  do  you  think?  M2  and  M3  areawfully  low  looking.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  4 percent  and  5-1/4  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Just  put  it  in  there baldly.  Look at  thealternative:  "This  action  is  expected  to  be  consistent  with  growth  inM1  at  an  annual  rate  of  around--."  We  can say  "6 percent  or  a  littlehigher."

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  It's  likely to  be  6-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  but  those differences  are  so  fine.I don't mean  to  sound--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's  a two-month  rate  for  the two  of  them?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No.  The  way this  is  written the M1  is  athree-month  rate.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  March to  June.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  but  the  other  two  are  two-month  rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  that's  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I guess  that's  6-1/2  to  7-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  We  could  put M1  on  a 6 to  7 percent basis  andkeep  the timeframe  the  same  for  all  the  aggregates.  It's  a littlepeculiar,  isn't  it,  to  have  one  aggregate  over  one  time  period  and  theother two  over  different  periods?  If  we  said  6 to  7 percent,  it'smuch--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  everything  is  a little  peculiarbecause  they  are  not  ordinarily that  far  off.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  6 to  7 percent  kind  of  gets  them all.  But  if  weuse  April  to  June--

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  But  is  6 to  7 percent  consistent  with  "maintainthe  existing"?  It  seems  to me  that  that  doesn't  line  up.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  It  does  April  to  June.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  April to  June  it  does.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I hate to  put  two-month  growth  rates  inthere,  but  we  could  do  that--roughly 6 to  7 percent--for  all  of themfor April  to  June.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  It  gives  us  a little  more  flexibility.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  M3  is  actually  higher  than  that  I think.5/21/85-38-

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Another  alternative,  Mr.  Chairman, would  be touse  the three months  for M2  and M3  and maybe  lower  the  number  a littlefrom the  7 to  8 percent  or  lower  it  a lot  and  indicate  the  possibilitythat  it  might be  more because  of the  shortfall  in  the--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I suppose  we  could  just  say  something morevague  such  as  "expected  to  be  consistent with  growth  of  M1  at  anannual  rate  of  around  6 percent  or  a  little higher, while  M2  and M3would  be  expected  to  increase  at  a slower  rate  of  speed  than  impliedearlier,  due  to  the  sluggish  growth  in  the--"

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That  would  do  it.  That  would  be  in  the  spiritof  the  last--

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  I think the  neatest  thing  to  do  isto  say  April to  June  rates  of  6 to  7 percent  for  all  of  them  and  justwink  at  that  7-1/2  percent  on  M3.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Yes,  I think that--

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Even  better  might  be  to  say  6 to  7 percent  forM1  and  M2 April  to  June  and  7 to  8 percent  for  M3.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  My  only  trouble with  that  is  that  I don'tlike  two-month  growth  rates  and  if M2  and  M3  turned  out  to  have  alittle  bulge  on  the  other  side--well  within  what  we  thought  earlier--it  wouldn't  bother  me.  But  I don't  know that  it  makes  a lot  ofdifference.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  You  could  say  "M2  and M3  may  grow  slower thanthe  7 to  8 percent  rates  expected  earlier  because  of..."  to  allow forthat  possibility.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't mind  that.  Let  me  try  somethinglike  that.  The  alternative,  I guess,  is  giving  a two-month  growthrate  but  say  "expected to  be  consistent with  growth  of M1  at  an  annualrate  of  around  6 percent  or  a  little  higher,  while  M2  and M3  areexpected to  grow more  slowly  over  the  quarter  than  anticipated earlierin  the  light  of  the--."  One  of  them was  actually minus wasn't  it?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  "in  light  of  that--"

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  "April  performance."

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  "In  light  of April."

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  "The  sluggish April  performance."

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  "The  sluggish April."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "Their sluggish April  performance"  or"their weakness"  maybe.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  If  we  separate M1  and M2  and  M3,  does  thatperhaps  convey  the  notion  that  only M1  is  the target  now  and  that  forM2  and M3  we have  expectations  but  not  targets?5/21/85-39-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  You used  the word  "expected"  in both  casesdidn't  you,  Paul?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  way  this  would read  is:  "This  actionis  expected to  be  consistent with  growth  in  M1  at  an  annual  rate  ofaround  6 percent  or  a little higher  while  M2  and  M3  are  expected togrow more  slowly  over  the  quarter  than  anticipated  earlier  in  thelight  of  their weakness  in  April".  The  advantage of  this  is  that  ithas  M1  a tad higher than  what  we  said  we  envisaged  before  and  it'simmediately balanced  by  saying M2  and  M3  are  considerably lower.  Thealternative  is  just  using the  two-month  growth rates.  Or  we  can  dowhat  we  have  here.  Which  do  you  prefer?  I guess  I slightly preferthis.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  It's  fine  with  me.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Me  too.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  I prefer your  recent  language.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let's  assume that  for  the moment.[The  next  sentence  is]:  "Somewhat  lesser  reserve  restraint--"

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  "Would be  acceptable."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm perfectly  happy  to  have  it  "would" inthe  first  part  and  "might" in  the  second  part.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's  a shift.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  [Unintelligible].

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  [Unintelligible.]

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's  noticeable.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Under  a magnifying  glass!

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  that's  where  [markets]  put  the  directivelanguage.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  isn't  going  to  come  out  until  twomonths  from now.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I think they have  to  be  "woulds"  in both  casesor  "mights"  in  both cases;  I don't  care which  it  is.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?)  Well,  in both  cases  it  ought  to  be  "might"  sothat we  don't  get  trapped.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I can  go  with  "might."

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  I'd  prefer  "would/might."

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  [Unintelligible]  you'd  prefer  "woulds."5/21/85

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  That's what  I prefer  too,  but  what  do  youall  want  to  do?  It  doesn't  make  that  much  difference.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  "Might"  and  "would."

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  No,  I prefer  "would/would;"  I always  prefer  thatso  that  we  don't make  a mistake.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  How many members  of  the  Committee  prefer"might/would"?  The  alternative  is  going  to  be  "might/might."

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  What  happened to  "would/might"?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  right:  "would/might."  Did  I say  itwrong?

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Yes  sir.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I thought  that's  what  I gave  first.  Whoprefers  "would/might"?  Wait  a minute;  let me  see.  How many"might/mights" do  we  have?  Five.  Somebody  didn't vote.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Probably you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I picked the  "would/might."

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  He  counted  himself.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  "Would/mights."  That  sounds  infectious!

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  You wouldn't mind  some  company.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I count  one  vote  [more]  for  "would/might"at  this  point.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  We  can have  a softball  game:  the  Mights  and  theWoulds!

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  That's what  it  sounds  like!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  What's  this  federal  funds  rate  range?  Wehave  it  at  6 to  10  percent  and  that  still  seems  to be  ample  to  coverall  contingencies.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  In  "B" it's  5-1/2  to  9 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  where do  you  want  the  federal  fundsrate?  I don't  think  it's  worth  changing to  get  it  to  5-1/2--

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  Zero  to  12  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  6 to  10-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we're  left  with this  borrowingfigure.  The  center  point  seems  to  be  $350  million.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  And  all  the  thrift  borrowing  out.5/21/85-41-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  all  the  emergency  thrift  borrowing.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Only  emergency thrift  borrowing.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  The  bulk  of it  is  now extended  credit  andperhaps  more  of  it  will  be.  But  I would  say that  Mr.  Sternlight hasmade  a mental  adjustment  even  for  some  of  it  that  might  not  yet  beclassified  as  extended  credit,  at  least  recently.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  It  would  still  be  around  $100  million  now[unintelligible]  extended  credit  when  we make  some  allowance--

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  [Unintelligible]  adjustments.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Now we're  talking!

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  I don't  like  to  get  in  a position  ofsplitting hairs  about  this  borrowing.  But  it  seems  to  me that  $350million taken  by  itself  is  kind  of a threshold  because  if  it  goes  downand  stays  down  at  $350  million or  falls  below that,  there  is  a  realdanger:  I think we'd  find  ourselves  again  in  a situation  where  itwould  start  pushing  on  the  current  level  of  the  discount  rate.  And  atthis  juncture,  I at  least would  not  want  us  to  fall  into  a situationwhere  the  behavior  of  the  federal  funds  rate  starts  to  give  rise  tomentioned  $350  to  $375  million, but  I think the  $350  million  number  atthis  point  is  more  than  symbolically  significant because  I think itdoes  get  you  into  that  range where  I would  start  to  get  veryuncomfortable.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Why  don't  we make  it  $350  to  $400  million  andallow some  discretion to  be  exercised here?  I think we  all  expressedthe  view that  we  didn't  want  it  to  threaten the  discount  rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Whether  the  discount  rate  is  threatened  ornot  will  depend  upon what  goes  on  in  the  economy  or  the  exchange  rate,I suspect.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  But  that  would  take  place  in  thenormal  course  [of  events],  and  I wouldn't  want  to  kind  of  fall  intothat  independent  of  the  economy.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  I'd  be  concerned,  Mr.  Chairman,  about  moving  upto  $400  million.  I'm  afraid that  might  push  the  funds  rate  up.  Iwould not  like  to  see  that  happen.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  that's  why it  is  discretionary.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Leaving  a little margin  here  is  fine,obviously.  We  can  leave  a  little margin by  saying  $325  to  $375million.

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  I would  support  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think nobody  is  talking about  trying toforce the  federal  funds  rate  down  at  this  point  below where  it  wouldnaturally  lie,  which  is  a little  above  the  discount  rate.5/21/85-42-

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I would  feel  much more  comfortable  if we  stayedabove  $350  million.  I like  Jerry's  formulation  of  $350  to  $375million.  It  just  seems  to  me  that  if the  funds  rate  gets  down  belowthe  7-3/4  percent  range,  then it  raises  questions  again  about  whetheror  not  we're  going  to  have  another  cut  in the  discount  rate.  We'vesent  some  very  strong  signals  to  the markets  with this  cut  in  thediscount  rate.  And  I really wouldn't  want  to  send  any  more messageslike  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I don't  know whether  we  sent  a very  strongmessage;  they were  anticipating it  for two  weeks  before  it  happened.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Well,  given what's  happened to  market interestrates  and  stock  prices,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  markets  weren'texpecting  it  all  that  confidently.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  The  bond market was  down  1/2  of  a pointthis  morning;  I don't  know where  it  is  now.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  20  points  in  the  stock market  yesterday.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  Well,  it  sent  a signal  to  the market  that  theythink that  at  this  meeting  we  are  really  going  to  go  toward  ease.That's  one  of  the  things  I think  it  conveyed  to  the  markets.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  As  a technical  point,  Mr.  Chairman--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  did  the  stock market  do  this morning?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  the  first  half-hour  it  was  down  2 points,I might  mention a technical  point:  If,[so]  it  may  be  down  [now]. because  of  a wire  failure,  a large  bank borrows  $1-1/2  billion  orsomething  like  that  on  a Friday--which  often  happens  to  us--the  levelof borrowing  can  easily  be  $600  to  $700  million  with money marketconditions very  little  different  from  a borrowing  level  of  $300  to$350  million.  So  there  has  to  be--I  hope--some  sense  from theCommittee  that  there can  be  wide  swings  here  in  borrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I think we've  learned that  fromexperience.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  $325  to  $375  million.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Mr.  Chairman, the target  that  I think  you'relooking  at  is  $350  to  $375  million.  If  I understand,  that  wouldresult  in  the  federal  funds  rate  quite  likely moving  to  the  7-3/4percent  area immediately.  Is  that  a correct  interpretation?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  you  ask this  question  every  time,Roger,  and  I'm not  a prophet.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I understand that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I would  assume  it's  somewhere  in thatneighborhood,  give  or  take  50  basis  points.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Well,  if there's  50  basis  points  down  to  7-1/4percent  then  I would  oppose  it,  obviously.  I understand you're not  a5/21/85-43-prophet;  but  I think the  staff's  projection  suggests that  it  will  bemoving immediately  to  7-3/4  percent  as  a  result  of the  discount  ratecut  with  a $350  million borrowing  level.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  There may  be  slight  differences  injudgment  among  the  staff here.  I had  $300  to  $350  million;  there  areother  people,  and  I think Mr.  Sternlight  is  one,  who  would  say  $350million  or  maybe  a  shade  above  for that.  I don't  know how  one  couldpossibly be  certain  on  this.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  That  certainly  does  seem to  suggest  $325  to  $375million then,  doesn't  it?  It  encompasses  both views.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  But  it  really  suggests  that  we  ought  to  have  anagreed  upon  target  for  the  federal  funds  rate.  I would  think that's--

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Oh,  shame  on you,  Governor  Gramley!

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Not  a written  one.  Let  Steve translate that  towhatever  borrowing  level  is  appropriate.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  The  stock market, Mr.  Chairman, is  unchanged  at1:00  p.m.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And  that means  it  kept  all  its  gain.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So  it  is  pretty  good.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  know that  we  need  to  lingerover  this  point  forever.  I assume we  will  start--and probably  miss  itby  $100  million  plus  or minus--somewhere  around  $350  million  orslightly  above  with a bit  of  flexibility  on  either  side.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  What was  that  again?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  start  at  $350  or  a little  above  andhave  some  flexibility  either way  as  we move  along.

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  I don't  see  how  anybody  could  have  a problem withthat.thought?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How  do  you  want  to  express  that  noble

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  Just the  way  you did  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Just  say  $350  for  the moment  with  anunderstanding that  there's  a  little  flexibility.  All  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  Did  you  settle the  [language]  for  this  earlierpart?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  so.  We  more or  less  settled  itbut  various  people  are  unhappy.  It  reads:  "In  the  implementation ofpolicy  for  the  immediate  future,  and  against  the  background  of  therecent  reduction in  the discount  rate,  the  Committee  seeks  to  maintainabout  the  same  degree  of  pressure  on  bank reserve  positions.  Thisaction  is  expected  to  be  consistent  with  growth  in  M1  at  an  annual5/21/85-44-rate  of  around  6 percent  or  a little higher  during the  period  fromthe  quarter than  anticipated  earlier  in  the  light  of  their weakness  inevent  of  substantially  slower  growth  of the  monetary  aggregates  whilesomewhat  greater  restraint might  be  acceptable  in  the event  ofsubstantially  higher  growth."  All the  rest  of it  is  the  same  with  6to  10  percent  [for  the  funds  rate  range].

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  We  ended  up with  "would" and  "might"on the  second page?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  By  one  vote  as  I understood it,  with oneperson  not  voting.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Where you  said  that  there would  be  less  growththan  earlier  anticipated  for  M2  and M3,  don't  you think  we  ought  toput  in  the  percentages  earlier  anticipated?  There's  no  base  thereunless  somebody  goes  back  and  looks  at--

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Yes,  that's  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Whatever they  were.  What  were  they?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  7 to  8 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  For both?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  It  was  7 percent  for  M2  and  8 percent  for  M3.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Add  "the  7 to  8 percent  range  anticipatedearlier."  Would you  want  to  say  "grow significantly  more slowly"?  Itwas  7 to  8 percent  for  both?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  No;  it  was  7 percent  for  M2  and  8 percent  forM3.  And more  slowly--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  So  it  should  say the  "7 and  8 percentanticipated,  respectively."

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  "Anticipated for  M2  and  M3,  respectively."

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  "Anticipated earlier  for M2  and  M3,respectively."

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I would  just  say  "less  rapidly"  instead  of"substantially less  rapidly" because,  as  you  say,  if we  should happento  get  a snap-back,  it  would  be  acceptable.

[SECTION]
