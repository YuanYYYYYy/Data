CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning, everyone.  First,  I wouldlike  to  acknowledge  the  fact  that  this  is  the  first meeting  for FirstVice President LeGrand Rives of  the  St.  Louis Bank,  Senior VicePresident  Robert  Eisenbeis of  the Atlanta Bank,  and Pauline  Chen ofthe New York Desk.  I would like  to welcome  all  of  you and requestthat  the  rest  of  us  approve  the minutes  of  the March 26  meeting.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  I will  call  onMessrs.  Prell  and Truman at  what has  to  be  the  earliest possible  timethat  this has  occurred.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  Except when  the Committee  started the meeting at8:00  in  the  morning.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You  always  throw a monkey wrench  intothe works!

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  People  have  said  that.  [Laughter]  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  [Statement--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  either gentleman?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mike,  the  core  rate  of  inflation in  the  forecastincreases  1/2  percentage point  between  the  first quarter of  this  yearand the  fourth quarter  of next  year.  If  one were to  assume  anunchanged policy and  to  extrapolate  that  out  into  1998,  what  do  youthink would happen  to  core  inflation  in  1998?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In 1998,  economic growth would remain essentiallyaround trend and  the unemployment  rate around  5-1/2  percent.  Ourjudgment  is  that  the  core  inflation rate  is  tending to  rise  graduallyand perhaps  it  would  continue  to  do  so  in  1998.  We  do not  think thatwe are  far beyond the NAIRU, and  that would mean a very gradual  trendin the  direction of  more  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  You have  a fairly  large  increase  forecast  for1996  and 1997.5/21/96

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  There are  some  exacerbating factors,  as  Iemphasized in my briefing, and those are  areas where the  uncertaintiesare  substantial.  But as  we  looked at  the  probability distribution  inlight of  developments since  the  last  Greenbook, we  felt  that we  oughtto  assign  a higher expected value  to  the  levels  of  grain and foodprices down  the  line.  That  is  the most  important  exacerbating  factor.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  is  the  timeframe  that  you assumeexists between the  increase in  grain prices  and its  effects  onpoultry, hog, and  cattle prices?  I will  assume  that  it  is  in  thatorder  of  lead times.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We noted in  the  Greenbook that we  do not  feelthat we  can pin that down with any certainty.  I think we  are alreadyseeing this  transmission process affecting  the  poultry area whereproducers are  cutting back on their production  levels,  and we  expectto  see  a price pass-through  there fairly promptly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can't you  tell  from  the futures prices?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We have  looked at  the  futures prices  and--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Don't  they  tell  you what average  leadtimes  are or  can be  assumed to be?

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Mr. Chairman, our  forecast  shows  anexpectation  of  higher poultry prices  showing through to  the  retaillevel more  fully by the  summer.  By late  fall  or early winter, wewould expect  to  see  the higher  hog prices  show up as  increased porkprices  in grocery  stores.  Higher  cattle prices would  show up  earlynext  year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is what  I was  going to  say--thatyou can make  an assumption.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We are making assumptions,  but  there  are noguarantees.  Certainly, it  is  our perception that  things  have startedto  turn  in  the  cattle  area.  Whereas,  a couple of months  ago,  we  sawthe risks  that herds would be cut  back, the  anecdotal  evidencesuggests  that  this process  is  now under way.  So, we  feel  more  certainthat there will  be  that pressure several  months  down the  road.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

Mr. LINDSEY.  Mike, my  first  question is,  do  we have anyevidence yet  on how households  have financed higher  gasoline prices?The increases  per month amount  to  about  $10  per car or  $20  perhousehold.  Is  that  coming out  of  savings  or  out  of  other  consumption?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I guess  our assumption  is  that  it would probablycome  out  of  savings  to  some degree  in the  short  run.  Over  time, wewould expect people to  reallocate their  spending  and to  absorb thatelsewhere.  But  in  the very short  run, there probably would be someinelasticity.  It would not be  a one-for-one substitution  for  otherexpenditures.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  The move in  oil prices  in  the  futures marketsuggests  that  the market  has changed its  expectations  toward higher5/21/96-3-prices  going quite a ways  out.  If  you just  look at  the  inventorybalances held by the  majors,  which are  now at  record lows,  why do youthink we  are  going to  see  a decline  in oil  prices?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  There  is  still  an anticipation  in the market  thatoil  prices will  decline.  What happened yesterday, though,  is  thatprices  in near-term contracts  jumped dramatically after  their initialdrop.  The market reports  talked about  the  closing  out  of  near-termcontracts,  some short  covering,  and so on.  As  we read most  of  thecommentary, though,  there  is  still  the  expectation  that the  net effectof  the  Iraqi  oil  flow will  be  to push oil  prices down a couple  dollarsper barrel  below what  they  otherwise would have been.  It  isrecognized  that  in the  near term  there  is  going  to  be  some  tendency torebuild stocks,  and that may mean  that we are not  going to  get  all  ofthis increased supply benefit passing  through to  retail  energy pricesvery promptly.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  What  is  the  average price  in your underlyingassumption?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We are  forecasting a decline  in oil  importprices  to  $17  per barrel and in WTI  spot prices  to  around  $19.50  perbarrel;  that  is  down  a couple of dollars  from current  levels.  Ourforecast did not assume  an  Iraqi  oil  decision at  this time,  but  it  didassume that  we would get essentially  the  same  amount of  oil  in  1997,so  our  forecast  had the  increased supply occurring  6 months  later.  Weactually have  the oil  price somewhat higher  than  the  futures prices  asof  last  week, so  in  some  sense  all  that  has happened is  an  adjustmentin  the  timing.  Other  than  the  short-term factors  that Mike wasreferring  to,  the one  argument  that  you might point  to  on  the  furtherout  picture is  that one might be  led  to  conclude  that this  is  "it"rather than an  assumption  that  Iraq will be  allowed to  export muchmore  in  the near  term.  So,  the prospect of  full  Iraqi productioncoming on  stream in  the next  year or  two has  gone  down.  That  is  theonly story that  I could pick up on  that.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  You are  saying  that Iraqi  oil  exports won'texceed 700,000 barrels per day in  this  period?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  That's right.  The probability that  it will be2 million barrels has gone  down even  as  the probability of  700,000barrels  has  gone up.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  In  terms  of  our  CPI  forecast,  if  we assume  thatthe  price of  oil  declines  a little  faster, the  contour of  the  forecastchanges  in  that  we have a little  less  inflation  this year  than nextyear.  But  at  this point, we need to monitor what  is  happening in  the

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mike, I want  to  go back to  grain prices.  Onetrend of  which we  are  aware  is  that  the  percentage of  processed foodcosts  that  stem  from their  grain content has  come  down--quitewhether  the  econometric models  that we use  take  that  into  account andalso  what  the  sensitivity of  food prices  is  to  changes  in  grain prices5/21/96as we  look ahead to  this period when the  grain price  increases areexpected to pass  through  to consumers?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  are well  aware  of  the  calculations  that  showhow the  grain in  a loaf  of  bread accounts  for  just  a few  cents of  itscost.  There has been  an  increase  in packaging and distribution costsso  that  there  is  less  sensitivity  to  changes  in  grain prices  than  inthe past.  The big kicker here  is  the meat price  story, and thereagain we are  less  certain  about  the  timing.  There have been changesin  the production processes, as  we have  seen  dramatically illustratedin  the poultry and pork industries.  So,  one does have  to  be  a littlecautious  in  following past patterns here,  but we  think that  ultimatelythis  grain price  increase  is  creating a lot  of pressure on margins  andwill  lead  to  reduced supply.  That  is  where the  big kicker will comeover  the  forecast period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Isn't  that  inflationary effect relatedonly to  feed grain prices?  The  amount of wheat  that  is  used for feedgrains  is  very small,  and as  we know breakfast  cereal prices  went downas  the price of  wheat went up.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Perhaps.  I think we need to  see what happenswith  cereal coupons  and all  of  that business.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Except for  its  impact  on  the exportthe  economy, whereas  corn  is  a major  input  into  the  food chain--actually, corn,  soybeans,  and  soybean meal.  Wheat used to be  a keyfactor  twenty or  thirty years  ago,  but  it  isn't  any more.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That  underscores  again that, while we  knowsomething about  a good  chunk of  this year's wheat  crop, we know verylittle  about  the  corn and  soybean crop  outlook.  We are making a bet,and the markets  are making  a bet.  We  are pretty much  in  line with  thegoing to  know the  outcome  for  another  four or  five months.  I thinkone's  optimism on  this  score  has to  be  tempered by  the  fact  thatinventories are  quite  low and demand growth  seems  to  be  robust  enoughthat one  year of  good harvests probably will  not relieve  the  pressuresentirely.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's probably good  for  the  farm incomesof  our wheat  growers when they produce a crop, but  it  isn't good  formanufacturers  of  combines!  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you.  Mike,  one  of  the  themes  that  camethrough  in the  Greenbook, and you alluded to  it  briefly  today, is  thedeterioration  in  inflationary expectations.  You  seem to  think  thatinflationary expectations  are going to  rise, and  I would like you toelaborate  a little  on  that.  It  seems  to  me  that one  could tell astory that  a lot  of  what  is happening  here stems  from one-time  supplyshocks,  and it  is  not  obvious to  me how that translates  intoinflationary expectations.  So,  I would  like to  know a little  moreabout your  thinking.  Do  you have  some  sort of  COLA mechanism  in mindor exactly what?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think that's  important whether  it's  a formalCOLA--and  COLAs are much  less  important  in the  economy today than  they5/21/96once were--or an  informal  process,  in  the  sense  that  employers  areconscious  of  what  is  happening to  the  cost of  living and have  somesort  of  behavioral norms  for adjusting wages  in  light  of changes  inthe  cost of  living.  In  any event,  there would seem  to  be  a tendencyfor  one-time shocks  to  be built  into wage  increases as  they engender  acertain elevation of  expectations  about  ongoing price increases.  Ithink there  is  little basis  for thinking  that  people will  look at  thisprice increase  as  a one-time  shock, that workers will  absorb  thatincrease, pass  the income willingly on  to  the  farmers,  and we won'thave any resulting elevation  of wage  increases with resulting  costpressures.  To date we don't have  a lot  of  evidence to  support thishypothesis, but  if  one  looks  at  the Michigan survey for early May,coming as  it  does  on  the  heels of  the April  survey, the  one-year, meaninflation expectations  measure has  gone  up  fairly substantially and itseems  quite  likely that  it  has  been affected by  the gasoline  priceincrease.  We  think that  increase will  be  reversed fairly  quickly, butas we move  out  into  the  second half  of  1996,  we are  going to  have,  inour  forecast  at  least,  food prices  increasing more  rapidly and wewould anticipate  that  the  consumer will  be quite  sensitive  to  thatchange.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  So  it  is  a sort  of  preservation of  real wagesstory?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That's the most  direct  driving  force.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I gather that you think it's  consistent withhistorical  experience;  we have  had these kinds  of  shocks  before.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  As  best one  can judge,  yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow, I'm sorry,  Iinterrupted you.  Did you have  a follow-up?

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I just wanted  to make  sure  that  the  econometricmodel did  take  into  consideration  the  reduction  in the  percentage ofprocessed food costs  that  is  accounted  for by grain  costs.

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  The model estimated with data  from  20  yearsago  showed a 30  percent  farm value  in  the CPI  for  food prices.  Thatvalue is  about  17  percent  now, so  we  have made some  allowance  in  themodel's  coefficients  for  the decline  in  the weight  of  farm grainprices.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mike,  turning  from this  supply shock  to  theunderlying demand, you did mention a number of  factors  that you putinto  your projections  that  acted to  damp  demand.  I was  struck by howstable unemployment  stays  through 1997,  granted that you  areprojecting growth  that  is  a little  higher than  in 1995.  Could youtalk a little more  about  the unemployment and  labor market  side?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I take  it  that  you are  suggesting that  we  take asgiven  the projected output path and  look beyond  that.  The year  19955/21/96is  still  something of  a mystery.  We had essentially  stable unemploy-ment  in the  face  of  very low GDP growth.  One possibility is  that  GDPgrowth was mismeasured.  One  hint  that we have,  and have mentionedpreviously, is  that  looking at  the  addition from  the  income side  onewould conclude  that GDP should have  grown about  a percentage pointfaster.  That would help  to reconcile  this  behavior.  I don't want  topush  that too  far.  We  don't  know where  the  truth  is  in  that regard,but  it  is  a possibility.  Another point  is  that  these  relationshipsare not  super  tight  in the  short  run.  There  is  considerable varia-bility in the  Okun's  law relationship.  This  means  that what  happenedlast year  could be  viewed as  just a random event  or we could have somecontinued disturbance as  we  go  forward.  Last year, we had very weakgrowth  in the  labor  force.  We  also had very small  increases  inhousehold employment.  These  tend to  correlate,  but perhaps  it  isarguable  that  somehow or  other we will  get some  rebound in  the  growthof  the  labor  force  and unemployment will  tick  up  a bit  and average outin  line with  the experience  in  earlier years.  But  there  is  nothing tosuggest  that  we  ought to  think about  it  that way, and going  forward,we have  the  labor  force  tending  to grow  slowly with a flat  labor  forceparticipation rate.  That  is  one uncertainty that we discussedpreviously, but basically we have a normal  alignment  of  output growthand unemployment  movements  in our  forecast.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Maybe  it's  just  the  tone  of  the  Greenbook, butgiven the  feel  of  the  underlying strength of  demand  in the  Greenbook Iwas  surprised to  see  this  stability.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I think  that brings you back  then  to  the  questionof whether demand really will  slacken as  quickly and as  much as wehave  in the  forecast.  I indicated that  a number  of  assumptions  aboutthe  behavior of  various  sectors underlie that  forecast.  These reallyhave  not  changed in  our view.  Our basic view has  been that  we don'tsee  underlying forces  in monetary policy,  fiscal policy,  the dollar,and so  on  that  ought  to  be  expected to  produce persistently more  rapidor  slower growth than potential  as  we move  out.  In  the  very shortrun, we can see  a flattening of  motor vehicle production.  Thearithmetic  relating  to that  helps us  to reduce growth very quickly inour  forecast  from a more rapid pace in  the  second quarter to  amoderate pace  in the  third  quarter.  We  don't  see  ongoing,  double-digit growth  in business  fixed  investment as  plausible, but werecognize  some  upside risk on  the  computer side.  On the  consumerside,  we  could now be  seeing the  wealth effects  that were notperceptible  earlier, and  if  that  continued  in  some  significantmagnitude  our  consumption  forecast might  have an upside  risk.  Inhousing, the  anecdotal  indicators  and recent  survey evidence  do notsuggest  that we  are  getting the  kind of  weakening in starts  that wehave  in our  forecast, but we  are anticipating that there  will  be  asignificant drop, maybe  fairly quickly.  So,  we can  see  these upsiderisks.  Perhaps  there  are  risks  on  the  downside as well,  but  I takeyour point,  and  I think that  I communicated the view that  the riskseems  at  least  as  great  on  the upside  at  this  point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we should  emphasize what yousaid, Mike, only  if  the  relationship between the  unemployment rate andthe  potential rate  of  operations  of  the  economy as  a whole were verytight.  The data  show that  that  is  not  the case.  That's because  themeasurement problems  that we have in all  these statistics  are fairlylarge  and even  if we had an  exact  or very tight  relationship the  data5/21/96are going  to  be wrong.  So,  we have  to  try  to  average  through  the  fog,and  I think the  latter  is  a little more dense  than  it used  to  be.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  recognize that,  because we have  a new currentpopulation survey that  has been in place for  only a short  time,  theshort-run movements are very difficult  to  assess.  The seasonalfactors  could have  changed,  and we don't have  enough evidence  on whatthey are doing.  So,  we need  to  take  these numbers with a grain  ofsalt.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  You mentioned  that GDP  on  the  income  side wasalmost  a full  percent higher.  Where do you suppose  the  big surprisecomes  from?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  I can't say  that  there  is  a surprise  that  Ican point  to.  I suppose  that  relative  to  our forecast  one  thing  thathappened last  year was  that we  got  a lot  of  growth in profits.  Wedon't  see  that  as  out  of  line with corporate profit reports, but,certainly, as  things  evolved last year  that was  one  factor that was  asurprise.  Basically, we have had a significant swing  in  statisticaldiscrepancies,  and where  that  gets  reduced, whether  it's  on  theproduct  side or  the  income side,  one  can't  know.  Historically, Ithink you  find it  somewhere  in-between and a little more  toward theincome  side on  average.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I was  thinking  about the  report  on  the  Treasurybalances  that  was mentioned earlier and why those balances are higher.Back in  the old days,  I would have  said that  the  reason is  therealization of  capital  gains  because  that  doesn't show up on  theincome  side.  So you  are saying that  there  is  something  else.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  That  is  something that  might be noted about  ourforecast.  In  essence,  disposable income  is  currently being reduced bythe  capital  gains  taxes  that  we think are probably a significantfactor  in the  heavy tax  revenues,  and yet  that does  not  show up  inincome.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  it may  suggest  is  thatmanufacturers  appear  to  keep  their books  internally  consistent  on  theincome  and the product  sides.  When we  look at  services,  however,  whatwe  see  are very considerable anomalies:  a fairly small  increase  inproductivity and reasonably slow nominal  output growth, but  asignificant  increase  in profitability and  therefore  implicitly anappreciable rise  in margins.  The notion  that  has  evolved  here  isthat,  somehow or  other, either  significant nominal  GDP  is missing fromthe  nonmanufacturing area or,  because of  the productivity data, pricelevels  are exaggerated, as  indeed they  almost  surely are.  One  sees,for  example,  that  over a protracted period  the price of medicalservices  in  the CPI  has gone  up much  faster  than average hourlyearnings  and I suspect,  though  I haven't  seen  the data, much  fasterthan  the  ECI  for medical  services.  This  suggests  that real  income hasfallen dramatically in that  area.  I shouldn't  say that;  it's  not realincome which suggests  that;  it's  the  relationship between productivityand price or  some  wage-price  that does not  seem  to  be  squaring  at all.There  seems  to  be a major anomaly in  the  structure  of  the  GDP whichfor the  first  time may be  on  the  income side.  Perhaps with additional5/21/96-8-data five years  from now we will  have a more  accurate appraisal  ofwhat has  been going on.  Ted just  nodded this way!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Truman expresses  his  opinionperfectly;  he does  it  with a nod.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I can measure  his approval  rating  in  thearc  of  his  nod!  [Laughter]  Any  further questions?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  This  may be related  to  the  line ofthunderstorms coming  from the  west and  everyone wanting  to  get  out  ofhere.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  you had said that  at  the  beginning, Iwould not  have  filibustered  as  much as  I did.  Who would like  to  startthe Committee's  discussion?  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  our monthly  indicators modelsuggests  that economic  growth in  the  current  quarter  should be closeto that  in the  first.  We believe  that  this relatively high growthrate  is  temporary because  it  reflects  the  building of  inventories bybusiness  firms.  Thus,  we see  the  economy slowing toward  its  long-rungrowth  trend of  2 percent  in  the  second half  of  the year,  assumingthat  interest rates  remain near current  levels.  We  expect 2 percentgrowth  in  1997  as  well, which is  just  slightly below the Greenbookforecast.Such a forecast  is not  as  attractive as  it  might  appear atfirst  glance.  The problem  is  that with  the  economy  operating aroundfull  employment,  it  will  be  difficult  to  make any progress  in gettingthe  inflation rate  down.  In  fact,  our structural  model  suggests  thatthere will  be  a small  amount of  upward pressure on  inflation  over  thisperiod, and  of  course  that  is what  the  Greenbook says  as well.  I findthis  forecast alarming and would like  to  be  in  a situation where  theinflation rate  is  projected to  come down gradually.Moreover,  it  seems  to  me  that  the downside  risks we wereworried about  earlier  in  the  year have dissipated and  that  the  risksare  largely  on the  upside now.  Economic  growth could  easily come  inabove our  forecast.  For  instance,  our  structural model predicts  aslowdown  in  the  second half  of  the year,  in part because  of  the  recentrise  in  long-term interest  rates.  However, given  that  the market'sexpectation  of  future  economic  activity  is  embedded in  long rates,  itindication  of  a future  robust economy.  Since we  are  already operatingat  a high  level  of resource  utilization, growth above  trend even for  afew quarters  could present  an upside  inflation risk.Turning  to  the  region, economic  expansion in  the TwelfthDistrict  is  continuing at  the  solid pace  that was  established  in  1995,which remains more  rapid than  that  for  the  rest  of  the nation.California  is making  a significant contribution to  District expansion.While  current employment  statistics  indicate  that  annualized jobgrowth in California during  the  first  four months  of  1996  was  belowthe  1995  pace,  the  recent  statistics are  likely to  be  revised upward.Other recent  indicators  such as  a declining unemployment  rate,substantial  gains  in state  tax  revenues,  and reduced  outmigrationsuggest  greater underlying strength  in  the  state economy.5/21/96After a relatively  slow  1995,  the Washington State  economyexpanded sharply in February and March, with noticeable job gains  inall major sectors.  Rapid expansion continues  in Nevada,  Utah, Oregon,and Arizona, with Arizona  accelerating since November after slowing  inthe middle of  1995.  Alaska and Hawaii  remain somewhat weak, however.Expansion  in  District employment  continues  to  be particularlystrong in  the  construction, services,  and trade  sectors.  The growthof  construction and  real  estate  loans  has  been strong  in the  District,and planned construction  remains high in  several  states.  Growth  inthe  District's boom  states  is  still being  spurred by expansion  inmanufacturing employment,  and with a shift  to  higher-paid  jobs,average manufacturing wages have  risen  substantially in  severalstates.  Consistent with the  recent  slowdown in  the  semiconductorindustry, employment  growth in  the  District computer  and electronicssector  slowed in  the  first  quarter.  However, our  industry contactsbelieve that  the  semiconductor industry  is  experiencing only atemporary glut and  that  the  computer  industry will undergo  rapidexpansion in  the  remainder of  1996,  although  at  a somewhat  less  robustpace  than in  1995.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  the  available  information on  theSeventh District  economy is  consistent  with moderate growth in  theregion.  In general, manufacturing is  still  our strongest-performingsector with growth somewhat  faster than  the  national  average.  Housingand retail  sales have  continued to  perform reasonably well  despitehigher mortgage interest  rates  and inclement  weather.  Labor marketsremain  tight with  few signs  of  significant upward pressure on wagerates.  Our purchasing managers'  surveys around the District  allsignal  expanding output  in April.  Durable  goods producers  generallyare  less  concerned than  they were  earlier  in 1996,  although they  stillexpect growth  to  slow  in  the  second half  of  this  year.  The Big Threeautomakers have raised their  1996  light  vehicle  sales  forecastsslightly.  They also  have  raised their second-quarter productionschedules,  mostly  to build inventories but  also  to  support  slightlystronger-than-expected sales  arising  from  the  incentives  that theyhave  in place.  Gross  orders  for heavy duty trucks  in March werestrong  enough so  that  some producers  have  delayed their  decisions  onmajor cutbacks  to  "build plans"  that  had been expected in  the  firstquarter.  The cutbacks  have now been delayed until  the  scheduledsummer plant  closings.  Several  other  industries  reported doing betterthan they expected earlier this  year  including producers  of  machinetools,  appliances, and small  construction  equipment.  Retailersgenerally  indicate  that  sales  in  the  District rose moderately in  Apriland early May, although inclement weather  this  spring slowed sales  ofsome  seasonal  items,  such as  lawn and garden merchandise  and motorboats.  Housing  activity still  appears to  be  fairly strong  in mostparts of  our District.  Sales  of  new and existing homes  increased insurveys  showed Midwest  home builders  to  be  the most  optimistic  of  anyin  the nation  in  both April  and May.  District respondents  to  thesenior  loan  officer survey reported strong  increases  in mortgage loandemand over  the past  three months.Labor markets  remain  tight  throughout  the District.  In  fact,economic  growth in parts  of  the  District,  such as  Indiana,  is5/21/96-10-reportedly being restrained currently by  labor shortages.  Theunemployment rate  in District  states  is  more  than  a full  percentagepoint below the national  average.  In March,  total  payrolls increasedslightly more rapidly  in  the  District than  in  the  rest of  the  nationdespite  the  relatively  larger drop  in manufacturing  employment relatedto  the  GM strike.  These workers, of  course,  are back on  the payrollnow.  Despite  the  tight  labor  markets, we  still  have few reports  ofmounting wage pressures.  In  fact,  over  the past year,  totalemployment  costs  increased  less  in the  Midwest  than nationally.  Jobsecurity concerns  are  identified as  the  key issue  that will  beemphasized  in the  upcoming labor negotiations.  In  the  steel  industry,however, management  is now offering a wage  increase  of  about  5 percentover  the  next  three  years, while  labor unions  are asking about 7-1/2percent.  Either  increase would be  the most  significant  that  theseunions have  had in  10  years but would  still  average  under 2-1/2percent  annually.  The  current  labor contract has  a no-strike  clausewith binding arbitration  so  that  the negotiations will  be  settledwithout a strike.  I spoke with  a CEO of  one  steel  company.  He  saidthat he  could  clearly offset  such wage  increases  with productivitygains.Turning to  the  agricultural  sector,  the major story for  ushas been  the  surge  in grain prices  that  others  have  mentioned.  Thesehigher prices have  led to  some  scaling back  in  livestock and poultryproduction.  With respect  to  the  spring planting season, which is  soimportant,  cool  temperatures  and wet  conditions  slowed progressconsiderably in  Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, with Illinois  closeto  average  and Iowa well  ahead of  normal.  It  is  still  too  early forus  to  know how much  food prices will rise.  That  will  depend  largelyon whether the harvest  eases  or exacerbates  the  critically tight  grainsupplies.  On the  other  hand, the higher  grain prices have acceleratedthe uptrend  in  land values and have  strengthened the balance  sheets  ofmany  farmers  in  our District.More generally, however, most reports  still  seem to  point  tolittle upward pressure on prices.  Contacts  indicate  that priceincreases  remain in  check both  on  the  input  side and  the output  side.Auto  industry suppliers  report  significant pressures  to  cut prices,and long-term purchase contracts  for  steel  are now renegotiated withsmaller price  increases.  However,  price components  in  both theChicago and  Detroit purchasing managers  surveys  did move  from  signal-ing  a decline  in prices  of parts  in  March to  an  increase  in April.Turning to  the national  picture, we  are in  general  agreementwith  the Greenbook.  The outlook  is  for  growth at or  above potentialfor  the remainder  of  this year.  The  key issue,  of  course,  is  theoutlook  for  inflation.  The Greenbook projects that  energy and  foodprice  increases are  likely to push  the  CPI  up a little  faster  than wewould  like.  At  the  same  time,  the  extent  to  which the  underlying rateof  inflation is  inching up  is  still  unclear.  Certainly,  the  risks ofhigher inflation are greater  today than  at  the  time  of  our  lastmeeting, and this  is  a matter of  concern.

MR. MCTEER.  On balance,  the Eleventh District  economy hasbeen experiencing moderate growth  and the  near-term prospects  lookreasonably good.  Employment  growth in  the  first  quarter was  about  the5/21/96-11-same  as  nationally, but  growth accelerated throughout  the  quarter.Real  estate and construction have  tended  to be  among  the  strongestsegments  of  the  District economy.  Single-family construction  is  doingparticularly well,  with  levels  of  starts  and new permits  in a few  ofour cities  reaching  levels not seen  in about  a decade.  Although thisis  still  the  exception, leasing activity in  a few of  our hottercommercial and office  markets  is being limited by a shortage  of  supplyfor  the  first  time  in  about  15  years.  Manufacturing  activity remainsstrong  overall,  corrugated box  demand is  on  the  rise,  and we haveseen  shortages and rationing  of  cement.  Even in  the  semiconductorindustry, where  inventory has been growing and prices that had beenfalling are  now flattening,  the bad news  is  that  output  growth willslow dramatically from  the  rates  of  the  last  few years.  The good newsis  that the  semiconductor demand is  likely to  grow by only 10  percentin  the year ahead.  The oil  price hike was  temporary, and oil  pricesare now back  to more  sustainable levels.  Whatever boost  the DallasDistrict gained from higher energy prices  is behind us,  and theindustry  is back on  a long-term downtrend.While I have  just emphasized areas  of  strength,  there  are  twonegatives  that  are  worth mentioning.  First,  the  impact of  droughtconditions  in much of  our District has  spread from hearing complaintsfrom ranchers  to hearing complaints also  from  farmers.  Beef  cattleprices are  at  a 20-year  low.  Grain prices are high, but  Districtfarmers  have  lost much  of their  crop  and cotton producers  are  gettinghurt  as  well.  Our agricultural  bankers  are  reporting rising debtloads  and delinquent payments.  The  second cloud on  the  horizon is  theprospect of  an  increase  in  the minimum wage  to  $5.15.  The  data fromthe  establishment survey of  wage and salary employment indicate  thatnearly one-fourth  of  Eleventh District  employment consists  of workersearning  less  than the proposed minimum wage,  compared to  about  one-sixth in  the nation as  a whole.  Using the  household survey narrowsthe gap  considerably.  Either way,  the Eleventh District  states  wouldbear a disproportionate burden of  the negative employment  impact  ofhigher minimum wages.On  the national  economy,  I am encouraged by  the  signs  ofstrength, although the uptick  in inflationary pressures, while havinga number of  transitory components,  has worsened the  inflation outlook.On the  other hand, bond and foreign  exchange markets  have  alreadytightened and will  be  countering inflationary pressures  as  we goforward.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman, economic  conditions  in NewEngland are  quite favorable,  though many of  our business contactsdescribe  the  situation as  continuing  to  be  highly competitive andtough.  Employment grew at  a rate  of  about  1-1/2  percent  last year  andin the  first  quarter  of  1996,  slightly  less  than  the pace  for  thenation but  consistent with New England's  long-term experience.  Theregional unemployment  rate was  4.7  percent  in April, with NewHampshire and Vermont  enjoying rates  below 4 percent.  We  do not  thinkthat  this  is  an indicator  that  wages are about  to  take off  in  theFirst District,  however,  since  in growth periods New England typicallyhas an  unemployment  rate below the  nation's.  Our contacts withregional businesses  are generally  reassuring on  this  score.  Wageincreases of  2 to  3 percent  are  the norm, although a few companies  are5/21/96-12-going to be more  generous.  Anecdotally, we  continue to  hear  storiesof  severe  labor  shortages, mostly for  software  specialists.  At  theBank, we have  been trying to  hire data communications people,  forexample.  It  is  not  just a question of  money.  These specialists  wouldrather work for a consultant,  or  even as  temporary employees,  to  getflexibility and  to  ensure  that  their  skills  stay on  the  cutting edge.Materials  and vendor prices  are  flat,  and retailers  are holding  theline  on customer prices.  A few manufacturers have  succeeded, however,in  raising their prices by modest amounts.The  retail  situation  in New England  is  very competitive,making  it  difficult  to  discern underlying economic  trends.  Upscalestores  are doing well,  but discounters  are  struggling.  Their  salesare down  from a year ago.  Among manufacturers,  revenues arecontinuing to  grow at  a fairly good rate.  Business  is  especially goodfor manufacturers of  capital  goods,  particularly  those producingtraditional products  such  as  industrial machinery and equipment  usedin  construction and high-tech  companies producing computer networkingand microelectronics products.  Concern was  expressed about  signs  ofslowing in  the  semiconductor business,  as  others have mentioned,although the  correction  is  expected to be temporary.  In  addition,several  of  our manufacturing contacts  think their  inventories  are  abit  on the  high side despite  generally good sales.  Retail contacts  incontrast believe that  they  have their  inventories under control.Loan growth in  the First  District continues  to  be slower  thanfor  the nation  as a whole,  and our banking contacts report  that  thecompetition to  make  loans  is  fierce.  Banks  indicate  that  they are  notlowering  standards  so much  as  they are relaxing terms--for example, bynot  requiring personal  guarantees.  I question whether  terms  andstandards really overlap and how one can distinguish between the  two.I think this  is  an  issue  for  some  of  the  lending  officer  reports  thatwe  get.On the  national  scene,  I remain convinced that  the  risks havetilted substantially to  the up  side.  As  the  Greenbook points outrather  forcefully, sources  of  economic weakness  and potentialrestraints  on  the  fairly solid pattern  of  current economic  growth  seemfew.  On  the  other hand, threats  to the  rather benign run of pricedata  that we  have  experienced  seem  significant.  I believe  these maystem more  from  inherent  demand  than  from supply shocks  in  food andenergy.  Those  shocks  could be  short-lived and  flow through  only to  amoderate extent  to  the  general price level.  However, the  impetus  fromtight  labor markets,  continued  income growth,  consumer durablespending, business investment,  housing, and  the  stock market  rallycould be  considerable.  The  issue  for me now  is  not  the  direction ofthe next  move but when we make  it.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman,  the  Southeast has  continued  to  growmoderately this  spring,  led  by strong and broad-based activity in twoof  our states,  Georgia and Florida,  where  over half  of  our District'sincome is  generated.  Employment  growth in  the  District has been at  arate  of  almost  3 percent  so  far  in  1996,  nearly double  the  nationalaverage.  But,  of  course,  we were  spared the bad weather and the  GMstrike that  affected other parts  of  the  country  earlier  in  the year.The  fastest  income growth has been  in  Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee.5/21/96-13-With  this  good income  growth has  come  excellent,  although  somewhatuneven,  consumer  spending.  There has  been particularly noticeablestrength  in  home-related goods  like furniture,  appliances, andcarpets,  and noticeably weak apparel  sales.  Housing  activity hasremained generally  good for  longer  than we  expected.  In  fact,  thereare  reports  of  shortages  in  inventories  of  single-family houses  inNashville  and Birmingham.  Multifamily building is  still  growing at arapid pace.  Construction of  commercial  buildings apparently hasaccelerated throughout  the  District,  but we don't see worrisomespeculative  kinds  of  building  in that  sector of  the  constructionindustry.Manufacturing activity  in our region has  picked up  some  inthe  last  few months,  but  the  outlook has  softened a bit  despiteincreased orders  for production.  Wage and  salary pressures  remainabout unchanged.  Recently, employers have been more concerned aboutpossible wage pressures, but at  the  same  time we  see  or  hear nosubstantial  evidence  that actual  labor costs  are accelerating.  Infact,  I have  just  completed a round of meetings with  small  groups ofbusiness  leaders  in various  cities  in our  District.  One  story  that Ibelieve got  told by someone  in  each meeting, with expressions  ofagreement  from other people  at  the meetings  in  almost  every case,  washow difficult  it  is  to  push through price  increases  in contrast  totheir past  experience.  Someone described the  situation at  one ofthose meetings  last  week as  one where almost  every customer was  actinglike Wal-Mart or  Home  Depot in  saying  to  their  suppliers, here  is whatI will  pay;  don't  tell me  about prices.Finally,  there  is  some  good news  from our Louisiana  oilpatch, which has  been  through some  really tough times  over the  lastfew years.  Drilling activity has picked up moderately.  Theimprovement  is  not  so much  in  response to  recent world price increasesbut  rather  is  attributable  to  some new technology  for  three-dimensional seismic  testing, which makes  it  easier  to pick the placesto  drill,  and to  deeper drilling  capabilities  than were available  inthe past.With  regard to  the national  outlook, while I would notdismiss  the  role  that  special  events have  played so  far  in  1996,  Iwould continue  to  argue  that  it  is  important  to  focus  on  thoseinfluences  that will  prevail  beyond the next  few months.  In doingthat,  our  outlook  is  not much  changed  since  late  1995.  We are nowforecasting GDP  growth of about  2-1/4  percent.  We anticipate  that  thesomewhat  stronger-than-expected growth in  the  first  half  of  the yearwill be  damped in  the  coming months by the  higher long-term  interestrates  that we have  already seen,  a slowdown in  housing  and relatedspending,  some deterioration  in consumer balance sheets,  and  thepersisting uneasiness among workers  that people have  talked about  fora long time.We now expect  the  CPI  to  average  about  3 percent  for  theyear.  That  is  about  1/4  percentage point  above our  forecast  of  a fewmonths  ago and reflects  all  that we now know about  oil  and grainprices.  We  expect  the  impact  of higher oil  and food prices  to bemoderate  in the near  term and  to dissipate  by later next  year.  Inparticular,  the  oil price  increase was  comparatively modest and  shouldbe reversed rather quickly.  I think it  is  very unlikely that  theprice changes  that  we have  seen will become  embedded in expectations5/21/96-14-and general price-setting behavior without  some  decision on  our partto  accommodate  it.  If  I am confident of  anything this morning,  it  isthat we will  not  do  that.Our  forecast  of  economic  growth  into next year differs  at  thesubstantial.  Those  differences  are somewhat greater near  the  end ofthe  forecast horizon where we  see  a bit  slower growth and theinflation rate  coming down somewhat more  quickly.  Thank you,  Mr.Chairman.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  the  Tenth District  economycontinues  to  grow at  a strong pace with most  indicators pointing tolittle change  since  our  last meeting.  Recent employment  reports  showthat  the  number of  jobs  in  the  District grew again  in March and thatemployment  in all  seven of  our states  is  growing at  rates  above  thenational  average.  Manufacturing and retail  trade remain principalsources  of  strength in our  region.  Our  survey of  factories  throughoutthe  region indicates  a recent rebound in production  schedules  andoptimism about  the  next six months.  In addition, building activity isrunning above a year ago and  our directors  report continued  strengthin commercial  construction.  The recent runup  in  oil prices  and  a morefavorable outlook have boosted energy activity in  the District.Drilling activity,  for example,  has  shown  steady increases  over thelast three  to  four months,  and energy employment actually rose  inWhile economic  activity is  generally solid in our District,the  agricultural  sector remains weak, and  the  District's veryimportant  cattle  industry  is  mired in  a deep  slump.  The liquidationof  cattle herds appears  to  have  begun.  One of  our  large packers  saidthat  their  average slaughter  rates  are up  12  to  14  percent  a monthover three  months ago.  Although our wheat  crop  is  now expected tocome  in  at about  half  its  normal  size,  the  rains  that we have  receivedpoint to  a more  favorable outlook  for  other crops,  corn for  example.Price pressures  are  still  stable, but  I do want  to  share someanecdotal  information.  I am  aware that  the  plural of  "anecdote" isnot  "data!"  With regard  to the  labor markets,  our discussions  suggestthat highly skilled workers  are  getting  some  fairly good wageincreases.  That would  include Boeing-type  employment in Wichita.Those  increases  are having  a ripple  effect  and are causing  some  gainsdown to  the  bottom end of  the  pay scale--such  as  increases  to  $6.00  anhour for  entry-level  clerks.  In the  crafts  area, business  agents  forworkers  in  our area  tell  us  that  they have  not  seen  such  strong demandfor  their  workers  since  the  late  1960s  and  that  their  ability tonegotiate  favorable wage  settlements  has  improved dramatically.  So,we are  seeing  some  increasing anecdotal  evidence  that  suggests  risingwage pressures  going  forward.On  the  national  level,  our  forecast  is  in  line with  that ofthe  Greenbook.  In  the very near term,  we continue  to  see  growth at  arate  above  that of  the  first  quarter.  With  the  long-term interestrate  increases  that have occurred, we  anticipate  that  the  rate  ofexpansion will  fall  back  toward the  economy's  long-term growthpotential  later  in  the year.  With  regard to  inflation, I am  less5/21/96-15-optimistic  than the  Greenbook and increasingly concerned about  theupside risk  of greater  inflation.  While  current inflation doesreflect the  effects  of  supply shocks,  I, like others  around the  table,believe  that  the  economy  is  operating  fundamentally at a level  wherethe unemployment  rate  is  around its  potential  and capacity utilizationaround  its potential.  Accordingly, I see  the upside risks  ofinflation  as  noticeably higher,  and we  should take that  into account.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic  activity inthe  Philadelphia  region is  showing signs  of  improvement across  a widerange of  sectors  including manufacturing, retailing, and construction.Growth is  uneven across  the District,  however, and  overall  the  regionlags  the  rest of  the  country.  I would still  categorize  the overallgrowth rate as  probably modest.  Some areas  in  the District  have lowunemployment rates  while others  still  have  quite high  levels  ofunemployment.  Wage pressures, while  firming  in a few areas,  generallyare  not accelerating.  General price  inflation also  is  still  subdued,but  some  commodities  like metals,  fuels,  agricultural  commodities,  andtextiles  show some  firming tendencies.The  national  economy appears  to me  to be in  reasonably goodshape.  I think  the  downside risk  of  late  last year and early thisyear has  subsided.  While we  see  clear  signs  of  firming  in thenational economy,  I really do  not see  a high probability of  a break-out  on  the up  side.  The outlook  for moderate growth is  therefore wellfounded in  my judgment.  Developments  on  the  inflation front  clearlyneed  to be  watched going  forward.  The  economy does  seem  to  besomewhat  less  inflation-prone  than  in  recent  decades, witness  theexperience since  1994 where we have  had an unemployment  rate  of  5-1/2percent and  the  inflation rate has  stayed more or  less  constant.  Towhat extent  and for how long  this  favorable experience will  last wedon't know, so we  have  to be  cautious about  what we  say concerning  thefuture.  We are,  however, better positioned now than we were  in  1994to deal  with inflationary pressures,  should they arise.  Then, we  hada clearly  stimulative monetary policy and a considerable distance  togo  just  to  get  to  a neutral policy  stance.  Today, we certainly arecloser to  a restrictive policy  stance,  should we need  to  get  there,  sowe have  more time  to engage in  watchful  waiting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At  the  Districtlevel,  the  overall picture has  not  changed a lot  since  our lastmeeting.  Our  regional  economy  is  still  growing at  a moderate  tomoderate-plus  pace, and I would say that growth  is  occurring prettyuniformly  throughout the  District.  Also, increasingly we  see  signsthat  the  level  of  activity is  high  in  relation to  capacity levels.  Inparticular,  several of  our  directors and  other business contacts havetold us  about  shortages  of  skilled  labor.  We were getting  somereports  like  this  earlier  in  the  year, but  they are  continuous now,especially with respect  to  skilled construction labor.  In thatregard, we  see considerable  strength  in both  residential  andcommercial  construction across much  of  the District,  notably  incommercial  construction along  the  lines  of  Bob McTeer's  comments.  Ithink a lot  of  the excess  commercial  space  including office  space,which was  so  apparent earlier  in  the expansion  especially in  the5/21/96-16-northern part  of  our region, has now been absorbed.  Vacancy rates  inRichmond,  for  example,  are very low in a variety of  categories  ofcommercial  space.  The  same  seems  to be  true  in  at  least  some parts ofthe Washington metropolitan  area  for  the  first  time  in  a long time.We are getting  some reports  of  speculative construction, which we  havenot  heard for a long time.  One other regional  report that  might beworth  noting is  that corporate  recruiting at  the  three  majoruniversities  in  North Carolina--UNC, Duke, and North Carolina State--was up  about  20  percent  this  year.  I guess  this  is  consistent withthe view  that  economic  activity in  our region  is  reasonably firm.At  the  national  level,  let me  first  tell  Mike  Prell  that  Ilike  the  change  in  the  format of  the  Greenbook.  I think  it  was a goodproduct before and  the  changes make  it  an even better  one.  But  thecontent  of  this month's  reported projection worries me  a good bit.The Greenbook paints  a picture--and  I think  a generally accuratepicture--of  an economy that  is  in a mature  stage  of  a businessexpansion  and growing at  a firm pace  in the  neighborhood of  capacitylevels with  all  of  the  inflationary risk  that  that entails.  Let  memake  just a couple  of  comments  on this.  First,  it  seems  clear  as  anumber  of people have  already suggested  that  aggregate  final  demand  isconsiderably stronger  currently than  one  might have anticipated a fewmonths  ago.  The  first-quarter GDP  report was very revealing.  Itshowed remarkable  strength across  the  board, and I think  that wasreally the  key  feature.  Second,  the numbers  Cathy Minehan,  Bob Parry,and a number of  other people  have  already mentioned permit  a verystrong case  to  be made now that  the  risks  in the  outlook have  shiftedGreenbook  is  now projecting  3-1/2  percent  real  GDP  growth  in  thecurrent quarter.  About a percentage point  of  that,  as  I understandit,  would be  in  productivity growth and about  2-1/2  percent  in  anincrease  in hours  worked, which is  well  above  a sustainablenoninflationary pace.  Moreover,  the  stronger projected growth  in GDPthis  quarter  is  predicated primarily on  stronger  inventory  investment.The projection for  growth in  final  demand actually shows  acurrent quarter could  turn out  to  be very robust, with the  implicationof  increasing  tightness  in  an already  tight  labor market  situation.In addition,  there  are  the  current problems  that  have already beenmentioned with respect to prospective  energy and  food prices  and thepossibility of  an  increase  in  the minimum wage.I think any one  of  these problems  could be  managed, but  whenthey are  all  put  together, that  raises  some real  questions  about  theoutlook.  The Greenbook  scenario  to  a large  extent is  counting on  therunup  in  long-term interest  rates  to  moderate the  growth  in  finaldemand as  we  move  into the  second half  of  the year.  The basis  forthis,  as  I understand  it,  is  that  real  long-term  rates are beingdriven up  by the  cyclical  strength  in  the  economy.  By pushing  reallong rates  up, market  forces  can  in  that way be  counted  on  to  containdemand and bring it  back to  trend.  What worries  me  is  that  thediscussion  in  the Greenbook gives  the  impression, maybe notintentionally, that  all  of  this  can happen without an  increase  inshort-term rates.  But  as  the  first  chart  in  the  Bluebook makes  clear,the backup  in  long-term rates  seems  at  this  stage  to  be due  to  a risein  1-year  forward rates  concentrated maybe  1 to  3 years  out.  In  otherwords,  it  looks  like  a significant part  of  the  increase  in  long-termrates  has been driven by  the  expectation in markets  that  the  Fed is5/21/96-17-going to  raise  short  rates by at  least  a moderate amount  either latethis  year or maybe  early next  year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Isn't  that more  the  result of  a shiftaway from the  expectation that  they are  going  lower?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Certainly, it  is  partly that,  but  if  you  lookat  the--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  you  look at  the  actual  pattern  offorward rates,  going  from overnight  out  to  a couple  of  years, whathappens  is  that  if  the  long-term rate  moves  the way you  said,  theother rates move back up.  According  to  the  analysis  in  the Bluebook,it  is  difficult  to  determine whether  the  term structure  at  this  stageis  reflecting anything more  than  liquidity demand.  So,  isn't what  isinvolved fundamentally  an upward  shift  in the  yield curve  as  distinctfrom a shift  up  in yields?

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Well,  I think both  elements probably areinvolved.  If  you  look at  the  first  chart  in the  Bluebook,  the middlepanel  there,  I am  trying  to  draw an  inference  from  that.  What  itsuggests  to  me at  least  is  that  expectations  for  short  rates may bepretty flat  through,  say,  the  third quarter, but  after that,  if  onelooks  at  Treasury yield curves,  I think they are  showing anexpectation  of  a  tightening of  policy late  this  year--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree with that.  I am  just  sayingthat  it  is  very difficult  to  differentiate  the  extent  of  the rise  fromwhat we  think we know about  the  liquidity premium.  It  is  probablyright  that  it  is  slightly more  than  the  latter, but the major  shifthas  to be  coming  up  from  the bottom.

MR. BROADDUS.  Well,  I would certainly agree  that  it  isalways  difficult  to  read the  term structure  and draw preciseinferences from  it.  We  tried to  look at  this pretty  carefully, and  asI look at  the  entire structure,  it  seems  to  suggest  that  generalexpectations--and I think  this  has been  confirmed in some  of  thedocumentation--are  that we  are  going to  hold policy pretty steady  atleast  through  the  third quarter and move  after  that.  The  only point  Iam trying  to make  is  that  the  behavior of  long  rates--and in  theoverall  scenario  long  rates  are  a major  factor  in  containing demand inthe  future--may be  more closely related  to  policy expectations  than  tofundamental  economic conditions.  If  that  is  the  case,  then  it  followsthat  we can't be  sure  whether  the  increase  in bond rates  that  hasoccurred will  necessarily contain  demand and  inflationary pressures  tothe  degree  that we  want.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  an  interesting  hypothesis, but  Ithink you would have  a  tough time  debating  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I have  a tough  time  in  all  debates,  but  Iwould still  be willing  to  debate  this!  [Laughter]  In any case,  Ithink it  raises  some  questions  about whether holding short-term  ratesrelatively constant  over  the  remainder of  the  year  is  going  to  get uswhere we need to  go,  or whether we need  to  consider somethingstronger.5/21/96-18-

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  The pace  of  economic  activity inthe  Eighth District appears  to  have  increased modestly since  our lastmeeting.  For  the  three months  ended in March, District  labor marketsremained tight.  The  average unemployment rate  is below  5 percent, andit  has been  that  low for  a large part  of  the  last  year  and a half.Strike activity, which had been quiescent,  is  again  a factor that mayimpact  costs  at  several  large  District manufacturing  firms.  OnSunday, a machinists'  union at  one  of  St.  Louis's  largest  employersauthorized a strike that will  affect  about  7,000  workers  directly.The contract  bargaining strategy in  the  auto  industry  is yet  to bedetermined, but negotiations  will  be  getting under way later  thisyear.  The two  largest automotive producers  in the  District plan toboost  second-quarter production by nearly  5 percent  above  their  first-quarter  levels.  Second-quarter production  is  about  1 percentage pointmore  than had been planned at  the  time of  our March meeting.Residential  construction activity in  the  first  quarter was  ata relatively high level.  By contrast,  construction contracts point  tosome prospective  weakness in  the nonresidential  sector, a pattern  thatdespite  strong overall  capital  spending  is  also  observed in  thenational  statistics.  Loan growth at  11  large District  banks  has beenoff  somewhat  in  recent months  from the  torrid pace of  a year earlier.This year such  loan growth has been dominated by real  estate  loans.Lenders are  still  very actively seeking borrowers  in  every category,including  consumer borrowers  despite  some  concerns  about  theircreditworthiness.  According  to  the  senior loan  officer survey,consumer  loan delinquencies  have picked up  somewhat more  than had beenexpected over  the  last  six months.  Nonetheless,  the rate  spreadbetween  securities  backed by  credit cards  and comparable  maturityTreasuries has  remained very low.The national  economic  outlook has  changed dramatically sinceinflation.  Imports  also have  increased  substantially, a possible  signof  excess  growth  in domestic  demand.  One  can't  dismiss the  increasein  inflation simply because  it  reflects  mainly higher prices  for  foodand energy.  I think the Greenbook  and comments  from Mike  Prellsupport  that  assessment  as well.  Low levels  of  agricultural  stocksand rising demand  for petroleum do not  suggest  an  early reversal  ofsuch price  pressures.  Furthermore,  the  broad monetary aggregates havebeen growing above  target  rates  and sweep-adjusted Ml  growth has  beenstrong.  By pegging  the  funds  rate at  5-1/4 percent  in the  face  ofrising market  interest rates--here we are back  in  the  same  debate,  Iguess--we may effectively be validating these price  increases.  Thedanger  is  that  if  price increases  are  validated by monetary policy,they  can become  embedded in  expectations,  particularly in  a tightlabor market  situation.  On  that  front,  the  Greenbook reports  that5/21/96-19-wages and  salaries  shot up  at  a 4.6  percent  annual  rate  in the  firstquarter,  the  largest  increase  in  5 years.  The  increase in  1995  was2.8 percent.  Furthermore, according to  the  Michigan survey--and Mikementioned this  as  well--households have  raised their  inflationexpectations  for  the next  12  months  from 4 percent  in  December to4-1/2 percent  in  April  to  5 percent  in May.  Looking  over  the next  5to  10  years,  average expected inflation  in  this  survey is  up  from  4.1percent  in April  to  4.8  percent  in May.  These  forecasts  can be  wrong,but  in  any event  the public perceives  that  inflation risks  haveincreased about  a full  percentage point  this  year.  That  matches  theincrease  in  long rates  since January.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you.  In  the Ninth District, while therewas  some pause in  growth earlier,  activity has  once again picked up.Most  of  the news  has  been on  the positive side,  and  I would say thatthe regional  economy  is now advancing more  strongly than  I, certainly,expected just  a few months ago.  To  give you a flavor  of  some of  this,housing activity is  strong and  as best  I can  judge will  remain so.There  is  a lot  of  activity  in major metropolitan areas  and housingshortages  in  some parts  of  the District.  Manufacturing activity isstrong and improving;  state  tax  revenues have been running aboveexpectations;  and energy exploration activity has  picked up.  Perhapsthe  one  obvious  sign of  difficulty is  in agriculture where  somelivestock producers  are having severe problems  and where  grainproducers  say they may or may not harvest  a crop.  Our problem is  notdrought;  it  is  too  much  ice and too much moisture.  Farmers have beengetting  out  into  the  fields  late,  among other problems.As  far  as  wage  increases and price pressures  are concerned,  Iwould say there has been no pronounced  change,  but there  are  scatteredindications  that  labor  is  getting a little more  aggressive and wageincreases  in  some instances  are  turning out  to  be  a little higher  thanwe were hearing  earlier.  On  the price  side,  the  anecdotal news  doesnot  indicate any pronounced change,  but  I sense  that,  if  anything,there  is perhaps  a little more  inflationary pressure than was the  casejust a few months ago.With respect to  the national  economy,  I certainly  agree  thatthere  are  increased risks of  more  inflation than  I expected earlier.We are  going  to  get more  inflation  than  I anticipated.  It  isdifficult  for me  to  assess  the  degree and duration  of  these risks.  Itwas not very many months  ago  that  the concerns  were  focused more  onthe down  side,  appropriately  in  my view.  That  was  the  case  in  late1995  and early this  year.  Those  concerns have  obviously  diminished,and diminished rather  quickly.  I can  imagine that  some of  the upsideconcerns  prevailing at  the moment could diminish quickly  as  well,  butmy sense  is  that  it would  take  a favorable combination  of  events  forthat  to  happen as  quickly as  it  did  earlier on  the down  side.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  This  is  the  first  time  that  I have  been thefirst  of  the governors  to  comment.  This  is  amazing;  maybe  I'll  masterthe  timing of  this  process  eventually!5/21/96-20-I have  been staying with  the  story of moderate growth  for  anumber of  meetings, and  I am beginning  to  bore  even myself.  But  I dothink there  is now a bit  more certainty  to  such a forecast  than therewas  earlier.  A lot  of  the  uncertainties  that we  saw  in the  fall  havedissipated.  Until  I heard Mr. Melzer,  I thought we were past  themajor  strike  activity problem, but maybe more  strikes will begenerated in  the  Midwest.  By and  large, however, some  of  the  majorstrikes  are  behind us,  and certainly the  possibility of  a Treasurydefault  that  was  a prime concern  for  this  group is  now behind us.  Thequestion of  government  shutdowns  and the  issue  of  budget deals  appearto  be  a bit more  quiescent now.  We did not  get  a long-term balancedbudget  agreement, but  it  does  appear that progress  is  being made  on ayear-by-year basis  in terms  of  holding expenditures  down andaddressing the near-term budget  deficit.  The winter weatherdisruptions  are behind us and we are  free  to  worry about  summerdrought, planting conditions,  and heat problems.The recent  statistics  display considerably more strength.The  labor market  is  still  showing reasonable  job growth, and  the  5.4percent unemployment  rate  is  impressive.  People are working and  theywill  continue  to  spend.  Housing has  remained amazingly strong becausethe  fundamentals  remain strong.  Business  capital  spending has  been amajor  factor  in  the  continuing expansion  and seems  to  be growingfurther  in the  context  of  an  apparent  commitment  to  capitalexpenditures  to  reduce  operating costs.  Computer expenditures  appearto  go  on and on,  and  I do  not  see  an end  in  sight,  especially in  lightof  the  new opportunities  stemming from  the  Internet.  But  I think  theoutlook for  expenditures  on plant  expansion  is  much more questionable.There are some  factors  favoring  the  sustainability of  thisexpansion.  Inventories  are  in much better balance now  than at  the  endof  1995.  The  financial markets  are  continuing to  supportopportunities  for  additional  investment.  In spite  of  the backup  ininterest rates,  the  term  structure  is  still  reasonably low.  The  stockit  is  still providing  a cheap  source of  equity capital.  Bank creditis  still  available.  Balance  sheets  are healthier.  As  I mentioned, wehave made  some  progress  on  the  federal deficit.  The  question now, Ibelieve, is what  kinds  of  things  can  throw the  economy off  thissustainable growth path?  In my view, unless we  resume concentratingon  deficit reduction and  start  to  address  some of  the  longer-termdeficit problems--entitlements  in particular--this  issue  is  going  tocome back  to haunt  us  and we will have higher  inflation expectationsand higher  interest  rates.  We  always  have  to  question where  we arewith respect  to  aggregate demand.  It has  been stronger  than we  hadexpected, but there  are  some signs  that suggest we  should at  leastquestion the  continuation of  growth at  the  current rate.On the  inflation  front--and this  is where  I want  to  end mycomments--it  is  possible  that  the  increases  in energy and  grain pricescan be  temporary.  But  if  they are  sustained, they will  get built  intoother price  structures  and  into  the wage  structure.  We  are gettingdiffering anecdotal  stories concerning wage pressures,  but we are  nowseeing indications  of  some  firming of wages  in  the  statistics.  Anincrease  in the minimum wage,  if  there  is  one,  would exacerbate thesituation.  I continue  to be  bothered by our  concentration  on the  CPIas  the  appropriate measure  of  cost-of-living  increases.  I appreciatedthe  inclusion of  the  GDP chain-weighted price  index  in the  Greenbook,5/21/96-21-but  it  also has problems.  Manufacturers  report  that  they can't  makeprice increases  stick, and yet we are  seeing some price  increases.Weighing all  of  these  differing reports  and anecdotal  stories,  I thinkthe  inflation risk has  increased and we  need to  be  focusing  on  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I believe  we may justnow be  entering  a very tricky and important  period.  The Greenbookshows  a very near-term  deceleration in GDP growth to  a 2 percentannual  rate.  Despite  that,  the  staff  foresees,  as  do many  othershere, an  inflationary  creep even without  a minimum wage bill.  If  weget  that bill,  I think  the  rise  in  inflation might  come  sooner  andbecome  stronger.  In my view, we have  been riding the  crest  of  areally remarkable period.  Growth has been  satisfactory.  We have  hadan  unemployment rate of  around 5-1/2  percent,  which of  course  is  seenas  being at  or below the NAIRU, for well  over six quarters  now.  GDPis  at  or near potential.  In spite  of  that,  inflation has  remainedquiescent.  We certainly do not have  the price  level  stability that  wewant  to  achieve, but  inflation nevertheless has  been  flat  andrelatively low.  So  far, no  significant  trend  is  visible  in  thestatistics.  The Greenbook  and other  forecasters project  some changein  this  starting very  soon--in  the  third quarter--and going  forwardthrough  the  forecast period and beyond.  We are  all  very jealous  ofthe  progress  that  we have made;  we  certainly want  more;  and weprobably would see  a persistent  rise  in  inflation, even  if  it  were  aslow rise,  as  very dangerous.  The question  is  whether  it will  happenand  if  so,  when.If  we look at GDP  growth in  recent quarters  and the Greenbookforecast  for  the  upcoming quarters  and include  the  3.5  percent  growthrate projected by  the  staff  for  the  current  quarter, we  find that  theaverage  for  this  quarter and  the previous  three  quarters  is  a growthrate  of 2.5  percent.  However,  GDP  growth has been  accelerating overthe  last  three  quarters.  If  one  looks  at  this  quarter  and the  nextthree as  projected  in  the  Greenbook, they  average a little more  than2.4  percent but display  a slowing  trend.  That  is  the projection.  Thebig downshift  in  GDP growth is  expected to  come  in  the periodimmediately ahead,  in  the  third quarter,  after which such growth  isprojected to  flatten and stay around 2 percent.  It  seems  to me  thatthis  outlook is  quite  credible, quite  likely.  It  seems  to  be  centeredon  sectors  like housing,  capital  investment,  net  exports, andgovernment  expenditures.  We have  seen  long rates  rise;  we have  seenthe  dollar  rise;  we have  seen  the deficit  go down,  so  this  outlook  isquite plausible.  If  we get  that  pattern, it  seems  to  me that  it  isalso plausible  that  inflation might continue  being dormant.  We mayeven find  that  the  economy's potential  is  a bit  higher, closer  to  the2.4  percent  or 2.5  percent growth  that we have been  experiencing andexpect  to  experience on  average.  With such growth rates,  inflationmight remain benign, and  that would be an  extremely positivedevelopment.  On  the  other hand, if  the  economy continues  to  bestronger  than expected, as  we have  seen  recently, and if  it  stays  thisstrong much  longer, we certainly  could  face a highly  increasinglikelihood of  greater and perhaps  somewhat more virulent  inflationthan  is  projected in  the Greenbook.5/21/96-22-I will  close where I began.  I think that  we are possibly ata very important watershed.  There are  some very important monthsimmediately  ahead.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I would like  to  comment on  two  issues central  tothe  national  economic  outlook:  first,  the possibility that  aggregatedemand growth will exceed trend  over  the  forecast period, pushing theeconomy well  beyond potential;  and, second, the  prospect that  coreinflation will  begin to  drift upward even if  the  economy continues  tooperate with  current margins  of  slack.  On  the  first  issue,  theGreenbook portrays  an  economy poised for  growth near trend by  thesecond half  of  1996.  In my assessment  of  the  outlook,  the  risk ofsustained demand growth exceeding  the growth  of  potential  is  notabsent.  Frankly, I was  surprised by  the  strength of  both consumptionand  investment  spending in  the  first quarter.  Nevertheless,  I stillconsider  the  Greenbook projection of moderate near-trend growth  overthe  forecast  horizon  to  be  sensible and most probable.  With  theinventory adjustment  process  seemingly nearing completion,  at  least  bythe  end of  this quarter,  I find  it  hard  to  identify any  fundamentalfactor or  imbalance--other  than  the  dangerously lofty  level  of  stockprices--that  I consider likely to  spur  either unsustainably rapidgrowth or  alternatively to  pose a significant  risk of  recession.  Thestock market  factor,  it  seems  to me,  could cut  either way;  it  posesboth kinds  of  risk.  Why do  I feel  that way?  For the  same  reasons  theGreenbook emphasized.  Pent-up demand for  consumer durables  seems  tobe  spent.  If  we can continue  to  rely on what  is  one  of  the mosttrustworthy relations  in  macroeconomics, namely  the  accelerator,  itseems probable to  me  that the  growth of  investment  spending will  slow.The  combination of  moderate growth  in our key  trading partners,coupled with  a dollar that  has  appreciated about  4 percent just  thisyear--the  dollar's movement  is  working as  a stabilizer, as  Ted Trumanemphasized--should contain  impetus  originating in  the  external  sector.In addition  to  the  appreciation of  the dollar,  of  course,  themost potent  force  countering any spending shock  that  may have occurredis  the  large  swing  in  financial conditions.  Now, it  is  arguable  thatsome portion of  the  roughly  80  basis  point increase  in  long-terminterest  rates since  late January reflects  higher inflationaryexpectations.  But  my own reading  of  survey measures  of  inflationexpectations  suggests  that most  of  the movement represents an  increasein  real rates.  I think  such an  increase  is  perfectly consistent  withthe  perception that  demand is  stronger  than previously thought,  thatthe  shock  to  demand is  not  transitory, and that  the  Fed  indeed willneed to  pursue  tighter policies  than had been  anticipated earlier  tokeep  inflation  in  check.  It  seems  to me  that  given the  usual  lags,this  interest  rate  swing  should begin to  exercise  a restraininginfluence by  the  second half  of  the year.  A rule  of  thumb  I sometimesuse  is  that  a one  basis point  increase  in  the  long rate  cuts  $0.6billion  off  aggregate demand, which means  that,  say,  a 70  basis pointincrease  in  real  rates would chop  $42  billion or  0.6  percent  off  GDP.This  is  sufficient  to  counter a rather sizable and permanent upward  ISshock.  So,  I see  the  interest  rate  fluctuations  that have  occurred asserving as  an  important  stabilizer.  Under present  conditions,  itseems  to  me that  the  rebound  in long-term  rates  is  an appropriateantidote  to  increased upside risk.  However--and here  I certainly5/21/96-23-agree with the  comment  that  the Chairman  interjected in response  to  AlBroaddus's  statement--it  seems  to  me  that the  6 percent  long bondyield that  we had  in January was premised on  the  assumption  that wewould have  several  further  cuts  in  the  fed  funds  rate.  I also wouldagree  that  the present  level  of  roughly  7 percent  in the  long bondrate  appears  to  be  consistent with a funds  rate  that  is  expected toremain about where  it  is  or, with  some probability, to  increaseslightly during  the remainder of  the  year.I also want  to  spend a minute,  if  I may, commenting  on  theoutlook  for core  inflation because  I think the  Greenbook  inflationforecast  is  a little  too pessimistic.  Clearly, we have  an  economyoperating at  a level  where we need to  be  nervous about  risinginflation,  even abstracting  from supply side shocks.  We  can't  dismissthe possibility that  compensation  growth will  drift upward, raisingcore  inflation and  in  turn  inflationary  expectations.  This  is  a majorrisk.  Obviously, we  need to  be  vigilant in  scrutinizing  the data  forsigns  of  rising wages  and salaries.  We  should be  concerned  if  apattern of  faster wage and  salary growth materializes,  if  thattranslates  into  faster compensation growth,  and if  in turn  the  fastercompensation growth translates  into more  rapid core  inflation.  Butthe  sentence  I just uttered contained  three  "ifs."First, we need to  see a pattern of  faster wage  and salarygrowth.  As  a number of you pointed out, we have  seen one  disturbinglylarge  reading on wages and  salaries in  the most  recent employment  costindex survey.  But  the  upward movement  there  was mysteriously rapidfor  sales workers  and one  reading does  not a trend make.  The  second"if"  in my sentence  concerned whether an increase  in wage  and  salarygrowth will  translate  into  faster compensation growth, and that  is  abig  "if."  At  this  point, the  12-month  change in  total  compensationgrowth in  the  ECI  has  remained virtually unchanged at  around 3 percentfor  five  quarters.  I would just  remind you that  standard economictheory suggests  that  both  firms  and workers  going  to  the bargainingtable  ought  to  be  concerned with  and ought  to  be bargaining over  totalcompensation, not wages  and salaries  alone.  Assuming that both  firmsand workers  recognize  the  tradeoff  they  face between benefits  andtake-home pay, slower benefits  growth  should be  reflected  in  fasterwage  and salary growth.  So,  on  its  own,  faster wage  and salary growthis not  cause  for alarm.  Now, I do not  want to  push  this hypothesistoo  far because,  although  this  is  a reasonable possibility, itcertainly  is  not  the  only possibility.  I am simply urging caution andam warning  against automatically assuming that  the  growth in  these  twocomponents  of  compensation  is  unconnected and  that  they  lead their  ownlives.My  final  "if"  concerned  the  relationship between  fastercompensation growth and product price  inflation and whether we  shouldautomatically assume  that  the  translation  there  will be one-for-one.The counter argument  is  that  for the  last  several  years product priceincreases  have  outstripped  increases  in unit  labor  costs  and that hasresulted in widening markups,  unusually strong earnings growth,  and arise  in  the profit share.  In that  sense,  core  inflation is  on thehigh  side now, given compensation growth and productivity trends.  Thestaff  documented this  situation and highlighted  its  implications  inthe January Chart  Show.  Widening profit margins  are  a developmentthat  should not be  expected to  continue  indefinitely.  Eventually,those  margins are  bound to  stabilize or  even  to  decline a bit.  That5/21/96-24-could occur  in a number of  ways:  with a decline  in the  inflation  ratecoupled with  stable  compensation growth or with an  increase  in  thepace of  compensation growth and  stable inflation.  I think  the  firstpossibility implies  some downside  risk to  the  inflation outlook, and Ido  not see  that  in the  Greenbook  forecast.  The second possibility isthat compensation growth  is  indeed poised to  rise  somewhat,  bringing ahalt  to  the  continuing widening of  profit margins.  That could occurwithout  any translation  into higher  core  inflation.  These are a bunchof  "ifs."  They are all  imponderables  and  they are  open  questions  thatwill  only be  answered with  the benefit  of  hindsight.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The broadeconomic  indicators  suggest that  the  economy in  the  Second Districtgrew at a moderate pace  in  recent weeks, which  is  an  improvement.  InNew York and 3.3  percent  in our part  of  New Jersey.  Vacancy rates  forprime commercial  office space  continued  to  inch  down in Manhattan andnorthern New Jersey, reflecting  the  improvement  in  office  leasings.Contract  awards  for nonresidential  construction, primarily additionsto  and alterations  of  commercial  space,  rose  sharply  in New Yorkcompared to  year-ago  levels.  The gain in New York was  offset  slightlyby a 1 percent  decline  in New Jersey.  In April,  retail  sales  taxcollections  rose  robustly in  New York  and moderately  in New Jersey ona 12-month basis,  implying  moderate to  strong gains  in retail  sales.Similar  12-month gains were  reported in  April personal  income  taxcollections.  Inflation moderated.  The April  consumer price index  forthe New York/northeastern New Jersey  region rose  just  2.9  percent on  a12-month basis,  following gains  of  3 to  3-1/2  percent  during  theprevious  4 months.On  the  national  level,  our  forecast  is  rather close  to  theGreenbook's.  The  differences  are  that we  show less  growth  in 1997,and we  are  below the  Board staff  in  our estimate  of  the  CPI  increasefor  1996.  On  a Q4/Q4  basis,  we have  the  CPI  at  3 percent  this  yearcompared with  the  Greenbook's  3.4 percent.  However,  we agree  on  3.2percent  in  1997.Our Bank's  forecasting record over recent  years  has beenquite good, except that we were  slow to  recognize  the wage  restraintthat is  the main reason for  continuing good inflation numbers.  We,like all  of  you,  are not  certain how long  that  can or will  continue.But  I could have  said  that  a year ago,  and the  restraint  has  in  factcontinued.  People  running businesses  still  seem  to be  reluctant  toraise prices.  When we talk  to  business people,  they  sound veryalarmist  about  their  industry  or about  the  country or  the  world  ingeneral, but  I find that  they know very  little about  those subjects.All  I am really  interested  in  is  what  they are  planning to do withtheir  own businesses.  When we ask  them  that question, we  are toldabout very severe price restraint--the inability  to pass  on  risingcosts--and the  need to  rationalize  their businesses.  So,  I do not  seegreat  risks  of  the  real  economy growing above  trend.  In  fact,  we havestrong growth  in the  first  half  of  this  year, especially in thecurrent  quarter,  and  then growth drops  slightly below trend in  thesecond half  of  the year and  in  1997.  So,  I see  the risks  as  balancedby-and-large.  Despite  all  that,  my  anxiety level  regarding pricetrends has  begun  to  gnaw.  However,  I consider the present  stance  of5/21/96-25-monetary policy  to be  just about  right  or  so  close to  it  that,  toborrow a phrase  from Ed Boehne,  "watchful waiting" is  appropriate.  Infact,  when he  mentioned that,  I remembered back about  four  decades  tomy days  as  an officer  of  the  deck on a Navy ship where the possibilityof  a storm encouraged one  to  increase the  state of  alert.  On  theother hand,  increasing the  state  of  alert  did not  in  turn  increase  theprobability of  the  storm.  [Laughter]

The  irony of  prosperityis  that  everything  is  closed for renovation  and repairs.  [Laughter]What  apparently are  not going to  be  sprouting  in the  region are  crops.In the  last  couple of  weeks we have heard a lot of  statements  that  arealarming.  They are  in sharp  contrast with what  we were being told  in--farmers,  equipment  suppliers,  seed  suppliers--that  high grain pricescaused by the drought  in other  areas would make  this  the best year  forthe  agricultural  economy  in memory  for  farmers  in our  region.  Nowthat  our  farmers  have already sold  in  the  futures markets  the  cropsthat  they have  not been  able  to plant, people  think it  will be  theworst  year  for  the  agricultural  economy in  memory.  I do not know howpervasive  the problem is,  but  I was  told  that as  of  last  Friday,  only6 percent  of  the  corn crop  was planted in Ohio.  Farmers  say  that  ifthey  do not  have  the  corn planted by mid-May, they will  switch  tobeans  or  some other  crops.  I am not  certain how reliable  thatdeadline  is.

MR. JORDAN.  Well, people are  saying that  there will  be  nocorn harvest  in  our  area, but  I am not  so  sure  about that.  Others aretelling us  that the Amish do  not have  any problem;  their horses  arenot  slowed down by  the  rain.  The  stories  also  are  very negativeregarding the nationwide wheat  and corn  crops,  and that  carries  overto  chickens, hogs,  and ultimately beef.  I am not  sure what to make  ofit  all.  Our bankers  say that  they are worried;  they  have a lot  offarmers  who were  just  too  enthusiastic  about  selling crops  for  forwarddelivery, and that  will result  in a financial problem  later  thissummer.I recently participated in  a round of  meetings with about  40people on  our  joint boards  of  directors  and  our small  business  andbank advisory councils.  One  of  the questions  I asked  them was  whetherthey were more or  less  optimistic  about  the  economy  than they had beenat  the  beginning of  the year.  Except  for one  software  company,  theywere consistently more optimistic  even  though the  almost universalbelief was  that  there will  be  an  extensive  General Motors  strike.  Theauto  supply companies  and others  are  saying that GM has  no  alternativebut  to  endure  a lengthy strike  if  that  is  needed  to  adjust  their badly5/21/96-26-misaligned cost  structure  to  everyone  else's.  With regard  to  thesoftware  industry,  there has  been an  increasingly strident  claim thatits growth  is  a bubble,  that  there  is  a severe  downside riskassociated with overpaying for  these  firms,  and  that  one of  these  dayswe will  see  a very  sharp correction  in  that industry.Let me  comment on  some  of  the  discussions  we  have heard onnational  issues.  What  the  income  side  is  telling us  about  thenational  income accounts  in  the  economy  is  an  important  issue.  It  mayexplain why sometimes when we  listen to  the  regional  reports based onanecdotal  information,  they sound like we have  achieved the  Lake  "Woe-begone"  economy where  everybody is  performing above  average.  Anexample  is  the anecdotes  that we hear about productivity.  When we  askthem, people  consistently tell  us  that  their  productivity improvementsare substantially higher than  those in  the  national  statistics.  Wehave  to  be cautious  about how we  interpret  those  reports  and how muchconfidence we can have  in them.The exchange  earlier  today, which Governor Yellen alsoreferred to,  between the  Chairman and Al  Broaddus  involves  an  issuethat we all  ought  to settle  in our own minds.  Early  this year  it wassaid that  interest rates  had dropped as  much as  they had on  theexpectation  that  the  expansion not  only was  going to be weaker  thanhad been  anticipated earlier,  but that  the  economy might  even bemoving  toward a borderline recession.  The  subsequent  runup  ininterest  rates  occurred because  the  economy  turned out to  be  strongerthan people  thought  it was  going  to be.  But  the  runup in  interestrates  also  implied that  the  expansion  eventually would slow, whichpresumably would mean  that  interest  rates would come  down, which meansthe  economy will  then  strengthen.  As  to  what  that  says about  policy,it  is pretty clear that  at  the  beginning  of  the year  and at  leastuntil  early February, intermediate-term rates  out  to  10  years  at  leastwere  based on an  expectation  of  further reductions  in  short-terminterest  rates.  My own  conclusion is  that  today's rates,  about  6.60percent  on  the  10-year maturity, are  consistent  with an unchangedlevel  of  the  funds  rate.  They  are not  based on  the  expectation  thatthe  funds  rate will  go up but  rather on a reversal of  the  priorexpectation  that  it  will  go  down.  I think everybody should try  tosettle  that  issue  in  their  own mind.With regard to  the  economic  outlook  for  the  nation, surveyssuch as  those  on  consumer  sentiment or  the  Blue  Chip don't  do much forme.  Early this  year we  saw a lot  of  stories  about  the  severe winterweather--record  snowfalls,  low temperatures, and all  the  evidence  thatwe  are  going  into a new Ice Age.  Last week we  heard evidence  that weare  in  a period of  global warming!  I hope  our  judgments  about  theeconomy are  more soundly based than  those  stories about  the weather.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I have not been here  since  the  last meeting  forall  intents  and purposes,  so  I don't really have anything  to  say aboutthe U.S.  economy.  But  I find this discussion very informative anduseful.  Where  I have  been,  I must  say, makes  me appreciate  cominghome.  It  is  very depressing to  live and work in Washington because  itmakes  one begin to  think  there  must be  something wrong with America.But  when  I go abroad I realize  that  this  is  the way  it works5/21/96-27-everywhere;  there  is  something wrong with  the world.  So,  at  least  Ifeel  relatively better.For  the  first time  in  years  I agree  completely with TedTruman on Japan,  and I think  that means,  Ted, that  we are both wrong!In Japan,  I was very much  struck by  the  fact  that  the recovery  isunder way.  They are  going  to have  a solid recovery this  year.  Solidgrowth probably will not be  sustainable next year but  is  likely toslow  somewhat.  Some of  their  larger banks have  begun  tackling  theirbanking  problems.  What  was most encouraging  in Japan was  the  end ofdenial.  I thought  they were very candid about what  their problemswere.  That  candor was  reflected also  in  a question  that  they  alwaysasked me about  our stock market.  I was  thinking very much about  whatjust came  up  in Jerry's comments  about  the bubble  in the  softwareindustry.  If you watch the  OTC,  not  the Dow, you begin to  appreciatethat a bubble might  very well  be  forming.  On one  day  last week whenthe  OTC was  recovering, all  of  the  top  10  issues  were  up at  least  9points.  There  are  IPOs  that  do not  trade  at  20  times  earnings;  theytrade  at 20  times  sales.  My  suggestion  for such  a company would be  tosell,  put  the money in  10-year notes,  and it  would be  better off  thatway.  This  is  the  silly season.  To be  sure, our  stock prices  are notat  Japanese levels,  but who knows  how much  longer  it will  take.  Theyare getting  closer.  In Japan, it  was nice  to  have  candid questions.Bill McDonough  and  I were  in Basle last  week, and I was  inFrance and  Italy and Switzerland  the  week before.  I think there  hasbeen a decline  in  candor and  an  increase  in  the  sense  of  denial.  Itreally  is  stunning  to me how everyone who even  thinks  about  the  issuewill  say:  You are  right;  what we are  doing is  not  economicallysensible,  but  it  is politically necessary.  If  they  follow that  kindof  policymaking long enough,  I don't  see how they are  going to  comeout  of  it.  They are  going  to  be announcing more  deficit reductionmeasures,  mostly on  the  spending side.  The French are  going  to  befollowing up  the cuts  in  spending they have  already made with  furthercuts  just  to  look credible.  I think  they will hit  3 percent  of  GDP.When you  have  the  kind of marginal propensity to  tax  that  thoseeconomies have,  which is  50  percent  or more, and you  begin to  havespending  contractions,  it  is  very hard to  lower  the deficit becausethe  inevitability of  G and Y and T make  the math  very, very difficult.They are chasing  themselves down.  There  is  also  a remarkable  sense  ofdenial  or willingness  to  deny  the problemsimplausible basis  on which to  run a democratic  society  for very long.I think  it  is  a good example  of  the  state  of  denial  in  France andGermany.This  seems  like  a veryI do not  share Ted's  view that we  are  going  to  have  a weakeuro.  I believe we probably are  going  to  have a strong euro  because  Ithink the  only thing  that  they will  be valuing after  convergence is5/21/96-28-credibility.  I do  think that  they  are going  to have some  credibilityproblems.  In my view  that  means their policy will have  to be  tighterthan  tight  to  begin with.  I  think  the path  of  convergence  is  going  tolead  to  a downward spiral  in Europe,  and  after  they get  there  they arestill  going  to  be  continuing with  that  sort  of policy.  So,  I cameaway from  Europe very, very  depressed,  from Japan mildly encouraged,but,  gee,  it  is  great  to  be  in America!

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That's  fine.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any questions  for  Don?  Clear  as  always.I think  this  is  indeed  a watershed period, as  Governor Kelleymentioned.  As  I listened  to  the  members'  comments  relating thecurrent  situation to  the Greenbook  forecast  and the  staff  briefings,  Icame  to  a  few conclusions  that  I hope characterize  the  substance  ofwhat we have  been discussing.  My  impression  is  that  if  I fullybelieved the  outlook  in  the Greenbook and  indeed  expected it  tomaterialize  as  projected,  I would feel  that  we  ought  to  be  tighteningpolicy  sooner  rather  than  later.  The  basic  reason  is  that  I find thefederal  funds  rate assumption  in the  Greenbook  inconsistent with  thestaff  outlook.  So,  the  key question  that  I envisage  is  essentiallywhether  the  internal  construction of  the  forecast  as  postulated by  theGreenbook is  consistent with the  world that  I believe  is  evolving  andto  which we must adjust.Let me say,  first,  that  I think the  Greenbook is  projectingrelatively modest  growth  in real  economic  activity and  that  the  risksto  that projection  are probably  on  the up  side.  I say that  becausethe  staff  is  projecting a  fairly dramatic  slowing in  the  growth  offinal  demand, and one  can scarcely conclude  that  the projectedinventory  investment is  other than  subdued.  We have  seen  rathertelling instances  in  the  past when business  firms  have  liquidatedinventories  to  the point  of  some  tightness.  As  they  endeavored torestore  some  inventory balances,  lead  times  immediately began  tostretch out  on deliveries  and desired safety  stocks  started to  expand.The  result  has been  a  fairly substantial acceleration in  inventoryinvestment  that  has  fed  back to  the  income  side and  created an5/21/96-29-economic growth rate  that  is  substantially greater than  that  in  theGreenbook  forecast.  Implicit  in  this  Greenbook forecast of  real  GDPis  a degree--I  could say a new form--of  inventory response  in theeconomy that  certainly  is much more subdued  than  that  experienced in1994.  In a certain sense,  it  is  also a good deal more  subdued thanone would anticipate on  the basis  of  historic  cyclical patterns overmuch of  the  post World War  II period  and far more  clearly before  then.The  crucial  issue  at  this  stage  is  the  evaluation of  the  realside  of  the  economy.  The real  side  is  being bolstered, as  best  anyonecan  judge at  this  stage,  by  the wealth  effect.  Not  that many monthsago,  everyone was sitting  around, here  and  elsewhere, and wonderingwhat  elements  in  the GDP were going  to  strengthen and  sustain therecovery.  We  could not  find it  in  residential  construction.  We couldnot  find it  in  capital  investment.  The consumer was  dead.  Thegovernment had gone out  of  business.  And clearly  the export  side wasnot doing anything.  We are  now sitting here  and wondering what  isgoing  to moderate this  expansion.  The change  has occurred  in only afew months and no  one  can  tell me  that  the world changes  that  rapidly.What  is  happening, and  one  sees  it  best  by looking at  the  S&P 500which has been going  straight up  in  the  charts,  is probably the  resultof  a wealth effect.  That  effect  is  lagged sometimes;  it  isindeterminate.  It  is  very difficult  to  judge,  but  one  gets  the  sensethat  this  is  where  some of  the  effect  is  probably stemming  from.Obviously, in  the capital goods  area we are  getting some  evidence  oflower capital  costs.  We  are  getting related  evidence of  increasedeffect  is  driving the  consumer.That  gets us  down to  the question  of  how long all  this willgo  on.  The stock market  as best  I can  judge  is  high;  it's  not thatthere  is  a bubble in  there;  I am not  sure we would know a bubble  if wesaw  it,  at  least  in advance.  But  one surely can't argue that  theunderpinnings  of  the  level  of  stock prices  are  all  extremely positive.It's  hard to  believe  that  if  any  series  of  adverse developments wereto  occur,  the  market would not come  down rather  substantially andreverse  the wealth  effect.  That  probably would damp economic  activityquite  substantially.  But  at  this  stage  I don't  think we  can make areasonable  judgment because  we  don't  know, frankly, how the  inventorysituation is  going  to  evolve.  We don't  know how the  accelerator  issuethat Governor  Yellen has  raised is  going  to  affect  the  capital  goodsto  balance as  one  can  imagine.  Yet,  to  quote Mike Prell,  "the smokinggun"  is missing.  We are  seeing a very pronounced set  of  pressuresthat  are  superimposed on  the pricing  structure.  Every time  I get  outin  the business  sector  I get  reports,  as a number  of you also  haveindicated you were getting,  that  no  one  can raise prices;  at  leastthat  is  the way our business  contacts put  it.  And, indeed, if  we  lookat  the basic  structure  of  industrial prices,  the  PPI,  and  the CPI,  wejust  do  not  find any significant evidence  of  cumulative pressures.  Wehave  seen very little  in  the  data  that  measure  capacity strain.  Wehave  seen very little  in  the  way of  increased delays  in  deliveriessince  that  very significant measure  of  pressures  came down.  Overtimeis  not building.  What we  are  seeing  is  a significant  increase  in therate  of  capacity expansion of  close  to  4 percent  at  an  annual  rate asprevious major investment projects are  brought  on  line  and push upcapacity.5/21/96-30-The  key to  this  outlook, as  I see  it,  is  not  an  evaluation ofthe physical  side  of  the  economy that appears  in  the  Greenbook becauseI suspect  that starting at midyear  economic  growth may well be  on  thelow side  of recent  experience.  The crucial  question is  the  linkage  toinflation.  At  this  stage  it  is  very difficult  to  take  the  existingstructure of  the NAIRUs,  capacity limits,  and the  usual potentialanalysis  that we  do  and square  it  in any measurable way with what  wesense  from anecdotal  reports.  I am not  saying that  one  cannot go  outand find pressures  on  entry-level  and  skilled wages, because we  aregetting wage  increases  of  3 percent.  If  we were not  getting any ofthose pieces  of  anecdotal  evidence,  the  number would be zero.  Thereare wage  increases  going  on and what we are not  sure  about  is  theoutlook  for unit  labor  costs.  It's  not  clear to  what  extent we  aregetting the  usual,  conventional pressures.I go back to  the  issue  that  I raised about a year ago,  namelythat  we seem  to  have created a level  of  job  insecurity that  hasoverwhelmed  the pressures  to  increase wages.  As  I made  the argumentback then,  the  state  of  technology is  creating a degree  or  sense ofjob  obsolescence and  fear that  apparently--I  use  the word  "apparently"because we  really don't  know and won't know until we  look  at  this  inretrospect--has  induced  a tremendous  shift  away from  increased wagesand  toward more job  security.  To be sure,  the  extraordinarily smallnumber of  strikes  in 1995,  a half-century low, is  not  going to  berepeated in  1996,  especially if  workers  at  General  Motors go  back onstrike.  Even  so, we are  still  seeing  a very  subdued pattern of  unionlabor contract  settlements,  granted  that  unions are  an increasinglysmaller part  of  the  private-sector workforce.  We have not yet  seenthe  "smoking gun."  I think  it  is  important  for us  to  see  some  of  thisevidence before we can be sure  that  the  translation  from  real  growthinto  inflation is  following  the historical patterns as  closely as  isimplicit  in  the Greenbook.  The Greenbook may well be right  and,indeed, to  argue that  it  is  not  is potentially  dangerous.  We  can  lullourselves  into thinking  that nirvana  is  here:  Inflation has died;  ithas been buried;  we  don't  need to  worry about  it;  and we  can go  on  ourmerry way.  That  is  a recipe for  disaster.  Nonetheless,  somethingdifferent  is  happening  that we  do  not  fully understand, and I thinkit's  important  for us  to  make certain  that we not  see  the  "smokinggun."  The  trouble, unfortunately, is  that  in monetary policy the"smoking gun" means  "we already shot  the  guy" and essentially  thatinflation  is  still  running.  But  there is  something not happening outthere.  We  are not getting  the usual pricing pressures;  we do  not  seefirms  able  to  move prices up at  these  rates  of  operation and at  theseunemployment  rates.  Something  is  going  on  that we do not  yet  fullyunderstand.How one  translates  that  into policy  requires us  to recognizean  important  factor, which Ed Boehne mentioned--namely that,  unlike1993  when  our policy was very consciously  stimulative  to  try  to undothe  credit  crunch, real  funds rates  are  not all  that  low at  thisstage.  It  is not  easy  to  determine what price  expectation variableswe  should apply to  overnight  rates, but  of  the  75  basis  point declinein the  nominal  funds  rate  that we  have  engineered,  I suspect  that  lessthan half  of  it  represents  a decline  in  the  real  funds  rate.  Indeed,depending on which measures we  use,  it  can be  significantly less  thanthat.  It  is  true,  as  Don mentioned, that  the  real  funds  rate is  inthe  lower part  of  the  range  for  the period  1979  to  date,  but weobviously are  well  above  the  average  rate over  a much  longer period of5/21/96-31-time.  Were  that  not the  case,  I think we would probably have  to makesome very key decisions  very soon  and do  so  before we have  theevidence  on how this watershed  issue  is  turning out.  I must  say thatI agree with Ed Boehne  that  the  existing rate  structure is  reasonablyhigh--probably somewhere near  average, maybe  slightly restrictive,to  wait and  indeed we should wait  for  a short while.  We probably willhave  to  make a judgment  by July.  It  is  conceivable  that  if  theinventory accumulation moves  faster  than  the Greenbook presupposes, wewould have to  move sooner.  But  my general view at  this  stage,  and Iraise  it  as  a recommendation,  is  alternative  "B,"  that  is,  to  donothing at  this  stage.  I would prefer a symmetric directive, but  thatis  a debatable  issue  and  one  can have  differing views  on  this.  ViceChairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would like  toconcentrate  on  the part  of  your presentation relating to what we don'tknow.  It  is  clear that we  don't  fully understand what  appear to  besome new relationships  in the  economy affecting  the connection betweenthe  real  economy and the  inflation rate.  And because  I think that  thepresent  stance  of monetary policy  is  close to  being correct,  if notabsolutely  so,  I feel  that  we have  the  luxury of  waiting until  ournext meeting  in  early July and  I believe we  should wait.  However, weshould be careful not  to  assume--and your  remarks did not  assume,indeed quite  to  the  contrary--that  today's  decision to  wait until  thenext  meeting has  any implication that  we will  reach  the  sameconclusion at  that  meeting.  The next  meeting will  be  a new ballgame.In my view, all we  are  discussing  is whether to  do  something  today orwait until  the July meeting to  consider what we  should do.  I verymuch believe  that we should wait.As  regards  symmetry and asymmetry, if  the  incoming datasuggest  that  it  would be  appropriate  for us  to  move before the  nextmeeting, those  data will  be  sufficiently dramatic  that  I am  sure youwould wish to  have  a conference  call.  But  I don't  see  the need  for anasymmetric  directive because  I think the  probability that  you would behighly likely or even  fairly likely  to  take action between now and thenext meeting  is  quite  low.  If we  were  to  adopt  an  asymmetricdirective at  this  meeting, then not move  to  implement  it  over  the next6 or  7 weeks  and decide  for  good and sufficient  reasons at  the  Julymeeting  that  a change  in  policy was not  appropriate,  I think  that  theminutes  of  this  meeting  to  be  released on  the  Friday following  themessage.  I do  not believe such  a message would be  in  our bestinterest.  So,  I very much believe that we  should take  alternative"B,"  and I feel perhaps  considerably more  strongly than you do,  Mr.Chairman,  that  symmetry  is  appropriate.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  I was  not very successful when Italked about  this  insurance policy concept before, but  I am going toventure  into  that  territory one  more time  and then probably leave  itat  that.  In my view, we  in  effect  took  out an  insurance policy intime  to  cancel  and avoid the  premium.  In my view, inflation andinflation expectations  have  increased.  I think the  stance  of  policyis  neutral  at best  and, more  likely, somewhat  stimulative.5/21/96-32-Accordingly, with such  a policy  stance, I think it  is  unlikely that wecan contain  inflation at  the  level where  it  has been  over  the  lastseveral years.  In  other words, we  are  likely to  lose ground.  Wecertainly are very unlikely to  make any progress  toward pricestability.  The risk of  waiting is  that  the  premium on this  insurancepolicy is  not  a fixed premium.  It  will  go up.  If  it  turns out  thatmonetary policy  is  perceived by markets  to  be out  of position in theface  of what  is happening  in  the  economy and particularly with respectto  inflation,  it  is  going to  cost  a lot  more  to  reverse  it  laterrather than  sooner.My preference would be  somewhere between  "B" and  "C."  Iwould  increase the  funds  rate  by 25  basis points  and probablyaccompany that with  an  increase  in  the  discount rate,  although that  isa separate matter,  obviously.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman, as  it  turns  out  I want  to  talkabout  insurance  policies as well.  I believe  that it  would be wise  totighten policy  at  this  time.  We  cut the  rate  in  January because anapparent  moderation in growth was  reducing inflationary pressures andbecause we wanted  insurance against  the  risk that  the  economy mightweaken  further.  Since then,  the  growth picture  of  the  economy hasbrightened considerably.  Growth  in  the  first half  of  the  year nowappears  to  be  exceeding  the  trend rate.  Since the  need to  guardagainst  a slow  economy has  evaporated,  it makes  sense  to undo  therisk we now need  to  insure  against  is  an  increase  in  inflation.  Thisview is  supported by  the  forecasts  of  both our  staff  at  the  SanFrancisco Fed and the  Greenbook.  At  a minimum,  it  is  safe  to  say  thatthere  is  little  reason to  expect  inflation  to  show  a downwardtrajectory at  current  levels  of  interest  rates.In my view, these  two  considerations  support  a 50  basis pointincrease in  the  funds  rate.  However, given that  an  increase  in  therate would represent  a change  in  the  direction of policy and would bea big surprise  to  the market,  it would seem prudent  to  me  to  go  for  a25  basis point  increase at  this  meeting.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I agree  strongly with Tom Melzer  and Bob Parryand  I am sure  that will  not surprise  anybody.  I guess  my views onpolicy  at  this  stage are  predicated on a couple  of  things,  Mr.Chairman.  First,  the  long-term goal  is price  stability.  The  staff  isnow projecting an  increase  in  the  inflation rate next  year.  I thinkit  is  a credible  forecast  and  it means  that  inflation is  moving  in  thewrong direction.  Second,  I know there  are  risks  on both  sides  of  thisforecast;  there  always  are.  But  it  seems  to me  that what we heardaround the  table  this  morning  suggests  that  the  risk definitely hasshifted, in my view at  least,  to  the  up  side  given the  strength indemand, price  shocks  in the  energy and food  sectors,  and  a possibleincrease in  the minimum wage.Despite  the  apparent divergence  in our views  about  interestrates  earlier in  the meeting, I think we would agree,  and I think mostobservers would agree,  that  the markets  are not  expecting a very5/21/96-33-pronounced  tightening  of  monetary policy, at  least  in the  near-termfuture--over the  next  two  or  three months.  I find  that  a littleintriguing because,  given all  that  is  going  on and  the  clear change  inthe  tone  of  the  economy, one  might  expect market  participants  toanticipate  somewhat more aggressive  policy moves.  There may beseveral  reasons  for  this.  One  explanation might  be  that  marketparticipants  are expecting us  to  be  somewhat more hesitant  in  thisperiod  of  the political  cycle.  Partly because  of  this,  and given  theunderlying inflation risks  and  the upside  risks  in  the outlook  foreconomic growth  that  I and others mentioned earlier,  I think we  shouldraise the  funds  rate  today.  I would prefer or  recommend a  1/4  pointincrease.  Even  though it  is  a change  in  the  direction of  policy,  itseems unlikely  to  me  that  an  increase that  modest  would do  anysignificant damage  to  real  economic  activity, although there would besome  real  cost.  I think the  increased credibility  flowing  from  suchan  action would hold down  inflationary expectations  and maybe reducethe  amount of  the  increase we would have  to  engineer  later  in thecycle  to  contain  inflation.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would prefer that  we tightennow.  I think we have  consistently underestimated the  strength of  theeconomy  over  the  last  several  months  and  earlier, going back to  lastfall.  We  are  looking  for  the  economy to  continue  to  be  strong.  Weare  no  longer  talking  about capping  inflation.  We are  talking  aboutseeing it  creep up,  or move up,  and that  is  the wrong directionbecause we want positive  economic  growth over  the  longer  term.  In myview, we may be  compromising the  sustainability of  the  expansion  if  weallow  inflation to  get  much higher  than what we  are  now projecting.At a minimum, we  should have an  asymmetric  directive  toward tightness.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I am going  to  continue  the revolt  of  thenonvoters!  [Laughter]  As  I  indicated before,  I  think we  clearly havemoved  from a period of  balanced risks  to  risks  on  the  up  side.  Therisks  of  increasing rates  of  inflation seem significant both  fromsupply  shocks  and from demand  factors.  It  may be  that  rising  long-term  interest  rates will  act  to  damp  activity  sufficiently, but  theebullience  of  the  stock market  and  the  continuing strength of  suchindicators as  housing and consumer  spending suggest  that  credit  andfunding are  both available  and not  overly costly.  In my view, theissue now  is  how forward-looking monetary policy should be.  I haveargued, and  I continue  to  believe,  that  the  costs  of  being wrong onthe up  side  and letting  inflation get out of  hand are greater  thanbeing wrong on  the down side.  We need  to  act  before we  see  the"whites of  the eyes"  of  inflation, as  you  have  argued, Mr. Chairman.I am  also worried now that  moving  later  in the  year might  be moredifficult  for  a number  of  reasons,  and  that  moving  later  than  thatmight  require  a more  significant move  than we would otherwise need.So,  for me  the  questions  are how much  to  do  and when  to  do  it.  Inthat  regard,  I want  to  piggyback on  the  insurance argument.  We did  25basis points  in January.  We thought  things were quite  slow at  thatpoint.  Hindsight now shows  that  they were not  as  slow as we  thought.I would reverse  the  insurance policy.  I would move  the  funds  rate  up25  basis points,  and  I would do  it  now.  At  a minimum,  I agree withPresident Hoenig  that  the  directive  should be  asymmetric.5/21/96-34-

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  As  I think about  the  economy and how it  is  likelyto perform  from here, my suspicion  is  that  housing  still  has somemomentum  that will  carry it  beyond  the next  quarter or  two.  Thatwould also be my judgment  about capital  spending.  As  far as  theconsumer is  concerned, I do  not doubt  the  significance  of  the wealtheffect, but we have  had sustained gains  in employment  as  well.  So,  Idon't  think that what  is  going on  in  that  sector is  entirely a wealtheffect.  That  leads  me not  to  be  terribly concerned about  the  outlookfor  the real  economy.  It  looks  satisfactory,  or maybe even betterthan  satisfactory,  to  me  going forward.  Is  this  going to  translateinto  the  kind of  inflation performance  that  is  forecast  in  theGreenbook or something  even worse?  You have pointed  out, Mr.Chairman,  that we  do  not fully understand what  is  going  on  there,whether it  is  job  insecurity or  other  things.  I agree with  that.  Ithink  it may only be with  the  benefit  of  some  considerable hindsightthat we  will  understand that  fully.From another perspective, if  I look at  real  interest  ratesand  the  real  federal  funds  rate  and ask myself  whether monetary policyis  too  stimulative  or  too restrictive  or  too whatever right  now, myjudgment  is  that  it  is not very far  from where  it  ought  to be.  I donot have  a strong conviction as  to  which direction  it may be  off.When I couple  that  consideration with what  I believe  about  the  realeconomy and what  I think I know and do  not  know about  inflation, thattells  me  that anything we do  ought  to  be  quite  cautious.  I just  donot  have  the  sense  that I know enough with enough confidence right  nowto come  out  strongly on one  side or  the  other.  So,  for  this  meeting Iam prepared to  stand pat.  But  I must  say that  I am gettingincreasingly concerned  about  the  inflation  situation.  While we canalways  explain  it  away with  special  factors--grain prices or  energyprices or whatever--it is  always  true  that  if  we  take out  the mostrapidly rising  components we  get  something  that we  like better.  Ithink we have  to  be  very careful about pursuing  that  very  far.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I think  that  if  people  outside this  room who payclose attention  to  these matters  saw  the  Greenbook  inflation  forecastfor  this year  and next year and heard some  of  the  comments  andconcerns  that people  around this  table have  expressed about  theinflation outlook, we  would be  sending a very bad message by nottaking action today.  So,  fortunately, outsiders  don't  see  or hearthose things.  [Laughter]  If  the minutes  of  this  meeting, which willcome  out  right  after the  next meeting, and comments  that people makein  the meantime convey the  idea that we  see  a worsening of  inflationand are  not doing  anything, I think  that would provide  a bad message.If  that  is  what happens,  then  I am going to  regret  that we did nottake  action.  If  I believed the  Greenbook inflation  forecast,  I wouldhave  to  say that  we  should tighten monetary policy.  I would not wantmy views  in  that case  to  be  taken as  acceptance  of  the  kind ofinflation prospects  that  we  are  being presented with.  I think  thatoutlook  is  totally unacceptable.  I didn't view the  reduction  in  the5/21/96-35-federal  funds  rate on  January 31  as  an  insurance  policy against thedownside  risks  in  the  real  economy.  The way  I thought about  it wasthat,  on the  basis of  the  information we were  getting,  the equilibriumreal  funds  rate appeared  to  have moved down  from what  I felt  was  anappropriate  level,  and  to  avoid a de  facto  tightening  of policy, thenominal  funds  rate  needed to  come down  from  the  5-1/2  percent  levelwhere  it  had been  since November 1995.  I think Don Kohn  is  correct  inhis  assessment that  more recent  developments  have reversed  thatdevelopments,  I would not have  supported the  1/4  point  reduction oneconomy is  likely to  be  enduring enough  that  we need to  move the  fundsrate back up  to where  it was  before January 31.  So,  I support  a no-change,  symmetric directive, though with considerable  concern abouthow it will  be  interpreted.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Several  issues  have been  talked about  around thetable,  and in the  end people have  to  make their own  judgments.  Withregard to  the  issue about  the  economy and the  structure of  theeconomy, most  of  the models, which  I think  the  Greenbook reflects,clearly  indicate  that  we should have  had accelerating  inflation  overthe  last  couple of  years  and are  likely to  have  accelerating inflationgoing forward.  But  the  actual  experience  in  the  last  couple of  yearshas not been particularly consistent with  forecasts based on thosemodels.  So,  our dilemma really  is  one  of  being open-minded to  thepossibility that  there  are  some structural  changes going on versusgetting  caught  up  in wishful  thinking because  tightening policy isalways more difficult  than easing.  It  is  easy  to  fall  into the  trapof  finding excuses  for  not  tightening, but my sense  is  that  there  isenough evidence over  the  last  year or so  to  cause us  to be more open-minded about  the prospect  that  the  economy may  indeed be  less prone  toinflation.  I think there  is  something to  that hypothesis, but we haveto be very careful  about  getting carried away with  it.On  the  stance  of  policy, if  the  federal  funds  rate were  acouple  of  percentage points  lower  or even  a percentage point  lower,  Iwould be more persuaded that  now is  the  time  to  act.  But  I don't  knowwhether current  policy is  a little  restrictive  or a littlestimulative.  My sense  is  that  it  is  probably broadly neutral andtherefore  that we  are  fairly close  to  wherever we need to  go.  Basedon  those  reasons,  not  out  of  any overwhelming conviction that  I amright but  after  trying  to  weigh the  evidence  and making  judgments  thatare  a matter of  both  logic  and  intuition, I come  down  on  the side  ofno change  at  this meeting, alternative B.On  the  issue  of  symmetry or no  symmetry,  I could  supporteither.  I don't  have  strong  feelings.  On  balance, I prefer symmetrymainly because  I can't  imagine that  you, Mr. Chairman, would make  awithout  a consultation with  the Committee.  Therefore,  I think theoperational value  of  asymmetry  in  these  circumstances  is  essentiallyworthless.  Looking ahead, since  we  do have a lag on  releasing theminutes,  I think asymmetry  could convey the  wrong impression of  wherewe  are when the minutes  are  made public six weeks  from now.  I wouldprefer  to  keep our  policy options  very open,  debate policy again in5/21/96-36-asymmetrical  directive at  this  meeting exert  any  influence  on  that

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would like  to  concur with what  severalof  you  said regarding  a telephone  consultation.  If  events  in  theintermeeting period differ significantly  from what we now expect,  thencertainly we ought  to  be  talking  on  the  telephone  to  see what,  ifanything, we want  to  do  then.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman, as  I said a little earlier, Ithink we are approaching but  are not  quite yet at  a watershed, and asa consequence  I don't have  a view at  this point  concerning what  waythe water  is  going  to  flow when  it  flows.  Clearly, there has  been ashifting  of  the  risks  to  the  up  side.  On  the  other hand, it  is  aclearly plausible prospect  that we will  get  a distinct slowing  in  theexpansion  rather soon.  If  we  do  get  that  slowing,  it  seems  to  me  thatthe  history of  the past two  or  three years  has  to  give us  some pauseabout just  how  "baked in  the  cake" an  inflationary rise may be.  Itcould well  turn  out  that  if  we get  a distinct  slowing,  we willcontinue  to  see a pattern of  stable inflation.  At any rate,  itdoesn't  seem  to  me  that  time  is  of  the  essence at  this point.  I think"watchful waiting" makes  good  sense.  I prefer  symmetry for preciselythe  reasons  that Ed Boehne just  stated, and  I won't repeat  them.  ButI must  say that,  for all  of  this,  I am sitting very lightly  in  thechair about  this business, and I would not  object  to  asymmetry.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Long-term rates  are up  substantially and thedollar  is  up a little,  so  we  already have  had some  tightening  in asense.  Don and,  I believe, Al  Broaddus  said  that a tightening of  thefed  funds  target right  now is  unlikely to  affect  long-term rates  theway such  a tightening  did in  early 1994.  I agree with  that,  but wedidn't  expect  the  impact  in 1994  either.  Also,  there  is  a bigdifference between  the present  5-1/4  percent  funds  rate  target  and  the3 percent  target  that  existed  then.  Our policy stance  is  not  soclearly  easy now in  my opinion.  Also,  it would bother  me somewhat  tobase a tightening move on  output and employment  growth developments.Inflation  is  up  overall,  but  its  rise has been mainly in measures thatinclude energy and not  in  core  inflation.  I think inflation  is  whatwe  ought  to  be  looking at  more  than  the  real  sector.  I agree withyour proposal  for  no  change with  a symmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  Mr.  Chairman, I support  your recommendation for"B,"  symmetric.  My preferred policy as  this  stage  is  cautiousinaction.  I guess  that's  called  "watchful waiting."  As  I indicatedin my earlier  comments,  the  current  level  of  long-bond rates  and thestronger  dollar seem  sufficient  to me  at  this  stage  to contain  theevident upside risk  to  spending.  This  level  of  long rates  does  seemconsistent  in my view with  the maintenance  of  the  funds  rate  at  itspresent  level,  at  least  for  the  time being.  The market  certainlyperceives  some chance  that  the  funds  rate will  need  to rise  thissummer and next  fall,  and  so  do  I because  I think the  risks haveshifted.  But the market  is  not  demanding or  even expecting  such amove today.  Market participants would be  surprised, and I think  itcould provoke an  excessive adjustment  in  long-term yields.5/21/96-37-I certainly understand the  reasons  for wanting to  move  inadvance  of an  increase  in  inflation.  I agree with  that  reasoning, andI definitely do not  object  to  the  reasoning  that  is  incorporated inthe Greenbook  about  the  inflationary process.  But  I share  some of  thedoubts  that  the Chairman has  expressed  so well,  and also PresidentsBoehne and Stern.  We do not  understand fully what  is  going  on  in  thelabor market as  evidenced by the  errors  in our  earlier inflationforecasts,  and I would like  to  wait  and get  a little more  information.If  the  current Greenbook forecast  is  accurate, we will  soon  see  clearevidence  of  an  increase  in  compensation growth and  an uptick  in  coreinflation.  When we  see  that,  I think we definitely will  need  torespond.  The staff's  financial  indicators package now routinelydepicts  the recommendations  of  Taylor's  rule.  This  is  a rule  of  thumbthat  I regularly consult as  a very rough guide  to  reasonable policy.I don't mean  to  say that  I think one  should follow  this  rulereligiously, but  according to  that  rule--and a number of  you have madethis  point--policy is  roughly appropriately positioned at  this  time.It  seems  appropriate given current inflation and resource  utilization.But  the  chart  also  indicates  that  it  will be  appropriate  to  tighten ifthe  Greenbook  forecast materializes,  and  I accept  that  conclusion.With respect  to  the  symmetry issue,  I prefer  symmetry for  thereasons that  have been explained by Vice  Chairman McDonough andPresident  Boehne.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I listened verycarefully  to  your argument regarding  the  downward pressure  that  is  nowbeing put  on prices.  The model  that crept  into my head was what  Iwill  call  the  secular versus  the  cyclical  factors.  There are  somesecular changes  occurring in  the  economy such as  a decline  inunionization and  the  spread of  different kinds  of  retailing.  Thesechanges have put  downward pressure on  the  capacity of  the  economy toincrease  prices.  I have  to  believe  that  the  secular trend  is probablynot  a permanent  one, and the  question  that we are  facing is  when  itwill  come  to  an  end.  I agree with the  Greenbook  and with  the majorityof  the  people at  the  table  that cyclical  pressures  are pointing towardmore  inflation.  The question  is whether  the  secular trend will  keepthe  cyclical pressures  from adding to  inflation.I have  just  one  data point,  not  enough to  base  a decision on,and  that  is  some  information Actually, this  information does  not come  from my  shopping  experience,but  from the  company  itself.  Over  the  last  two years  or  so,  they havebeen  cutting prices  on the  average  of  2 to  3 percent  a year.  That  ispartly an  effort  to  gain market  share  and partly,  I believe,  theresult of  new developments  in retailing.  That policy has  now changed.They have  stopped cutting prices  and are now starting  to  increasethem, albeit  very modestly.  While  this  is  only  one  data point,  itwhere  I shop a lot!5/21/96-38-does  suggest  to  me  that  the  secular  factors  are probably coming  to  anend.  We have  benefited from  them for  a long  time.The second issue  is  about  events.  I can't  imagine  anyforthcoming economic  event  that  is  going to  change anybody's  point  ofview.  What  future  statistic  is going  to cause us  to move?  Thereisn't  one.  So,  I am not  expecting  the need for  a telephoneconference,  and  I don't  think anyone  else  does  either because  therejust  is  no number  that would change something  fundamental  in  thisperiod.  The  reason is  that we  are not  in  an emergency kind  ofsituation.  When we  tightened policy in  1994,  I defended the move  eventhough the natural  rate was  below the  unemployment rate.  The reasonwas  that  if we  had waited  for  inflation  to  get  embedded into wagerates,  it  would already have been too  late and we would have  needed arecession  at  that  point to  get  the  inflation out  of  wage  rates.  So,  Idon't  think we  should be  driven by events.  If  we  actually are lookingfor  a reason in  the ECI  or  in wage rates,  it  will  be too  late when wesee  it.  It  is  my hunch that nobody here  knows  anyone who is  expectingto  cut  some salary.  The betting has  to be that  the  salary  is  going  togo  up.Having said all  that,  I have  one hunch and oneobservation, and that  is  not  enough for  me to  support an  increase  inrates  today.  But given that we are not  driven by events,  I am notsure  that that  is  the basis  on which we  should decide  symmetry versusasymmetry.  As  I listened to  the  comments around  the  table,  I detecteda strong undercurrent  of  unease.  So,  I am  in concert with JerryJordan's  observation  that perhaps  symmetric  is  not  the way  to go.  Weshould take note  of  what  is  happening, and even though  I favorsymmetry procedurally, I would prefer  "B,"  asymmetric  at  this  point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  It's  a very close  call,  Mr.  Chairman.  I was  inthe  group that  did not  favor  a reduction  in January, but  I don'tnecessarily conclude  that  that  means  we should reverse  that movetoday.  I think  the  risks  are clearly on  the  up side  for  outputrelative to  potential.  We  all  have  expressed concerns  about  theinflation outlook.  That outlook boils  down  in my judgment  to  twothings:  One is  food prices and the  other  is wages  and unit  laborcosts.  On  the  food-price side,  I think  the  outlook is  uncertain.  Itis  not  clear how much  of  the  increases  in grain prices will  be  movingforward  into  food prices.  I thought  the  analysis  in  the Greenbook wasparticularly helpful  in  showing  that  if  food prices do  increase,  theywill  seep  into the  overall  price level.  As  I think back, myexperience in  the  1970s  is  that  increases  in  food prices  tend to havea much  greater  impact  on  the  overall price level  than people  expect.It  just  seemed then that  everything started  to  go wrong and kept goingwrong.  If  food prices  do  increase,  I suspect that  we  will  relive  thatexperience  and have more of  a problem than people  expect.  Thatconclusion  is not  based on  any econometric model;  it's  just based onmy personal  instincts.  In  fact,  our  econometric model  at  the  ChicagoBank  is  slightly more optimistic  than  the Greenbook on  the  inflationoutlook.I think developments on  the wage and unit  labor  cost  sidewill  be  extremely  important  for policy.  It  would be helpful  to  havemore  information there,  but  I am not  sure we ever  have  enough5/21/96-39-information.  Something  obviously different  is  going on.  I thinkthere are  some  faint  indications  that wages  may be  rising morerapidly, but  as you said, Mr.  Chairman, we  clearly do not have  enoughevidence  to  reach  a  firm conclusion.  On balance,  I come  down in  favorof no  change,  but  I would prefer an  asymmetrical directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, I support  your recommendation foralternative B,  and for  the  reasons  that  Ed Boehne  articulated I,  too,would prefer  a  symmetrical directive.  Being  last  or near  last  tospeak,  I won't  repeat  all  the arguments  that  already have been made.One  of  the  things  that  got  a good bit of  discussion in  the earliergo-around was  the  run-up  in oil  and grain prices,  their  impact  on  theCPI,  and how much weight  to  give  to  that.  On  that point,  I have  hadto  remind myself over  the  last  couple of  months  about  an  importantfeature of  the  CPI--namely  that,  as  a  fixed weight  index,  it  tends  tooverstate  inflation when we  get  the kind of  relative price changesthat we  have  seen  recently.  Since  a fixed  weight  index  does notcapture  short-run substitution  effects--and someone  talked about  thatbriefly during  the  earlier  go-around--such an  index does  tend  to  showprices  going up quickly.  We  know  that what  really happens  is  thatsome  substitution  effect will  hold down  the  increase,  althoughsometimes with a  lag.  On that  point,  I would therefore  give somewhatless weight  than do  some  others  to  the  run-up  in  both oil  and gasprices.In preparation  for  this meeting we  talked  some  about what wecan learn  from  the yield curve, a  subject  that  also  came up thismorning.  There  are  a  lot  of  interesting questions  there,  but  I stillam not persuaded that  the  steepening in  the yield curve  that  we haveseen  recently provides  sufficient  evidence  that  an unchanged  fundsrate constitutes  an accommodative  shift  in our policy.  In  sum,  Iwould prefer  to  stand pat,  observe  developments very  carefully overthe period ahead, and be  ready to  move at  our next meeting  or beforeif  we begin  to  see  some  of  the  inflationary pressures  that peoplearound the  table have  noted  could happen.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We will now return  to  Don Kohn's query.Do  you  just want to  give  a short  summary so  people  can respond  to  it?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I was  thinking about  the  upcoming July meeting  andrecalling  the  Committee's  discussion  in February about paying a littlemore attention  to  its  long-run  objectives,  in particular its  inflationobjectives.  Taking  into  account speeches  such  as  the  one  that ViceChairman McDonough made  on  this  subject,  it  struck me  that  it  might beuseful  for  the  Committee members  to  discuss where  they expected to  bein  2-1/2  or 3 years  in  terms  of  those objectives.  That  would be  inaddition  to  the usual  discussion  leading to  the  selection of  monetaryaggregate ranges  that  the  Committee  is  still  required to  establishunder the  law.  The  discussion might  surface  some  of  the pros  and consof  this  longer-run  look at  policy.  So my proposal, Mr. Chairman, wasthat Committee members,  in  addition to  the  usual  1996-1997  forecaststhat  they would turn  in  for  inclusion in  the  Humphrey-Hawkins  reportand that you would discuss  in  your  testimony, also  submit  1998forecasts of  real  growth and inflation.  The purpose would not  be  topublish  those  additional  forecasts, but  rather  to  help  structure  theCommittee's discussion.  The other point I tried to  make  is  that,  ifthe  Committee members  decided  to  go  ahead with this,  it would  seem tome  that  the  1998  forecasts would  incorporate what  the  individualmembers  thought  ought  to  occur.  They would be  more  in  the nature  ofgoals necessarily than  forecasts  and would be based on  the monetarypolicy  that  the members  as  individuals  would pursue  if  they did nothave to  take  account  of  their colleagues  around the  table.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can  I just  amend that  slightly?  I thinkyou also would want  the  1997  forecast on  the  same basis.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Well,  the members  have  to  submit  1996  and 1997forecasts  in  July  1996.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  I am  trying to  get  at  is  that  Idon't  think we want a 1998  number unless  it  reflects a desired outcomeachieved through an  appropriate policy.  If  you have  a 1998  numberthat  is  the result  of  your  individual policy, it  also would be  usefulto  have a forecast of  1996,  1997,  1998  on  the  same basis.  That wouldhighlight  the difference between  the way we normally have  been doingthese  projections  and what your policy would produce.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That has  always been an  ambiguous  issue  and onethat  I think has  produced some  confusion  in  the past when  theCommittee has  discussed an  extension of  its  projections.  When you  areasked for your  1996  and  1997  forecasts, you are  asked to make your  ownassumptions about  monetary policy.5/21/96-41-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  They are assumptions  of what  the  membersthink monetary policy will  be, not what  they would  like  it  to be.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  No,  we have  asked the members  to  base  theirprojections  on what  they  think an optimal policy should be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  How would you differentiate between  thecurrent projection and  the new one?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  When you are projecting 1996  and 1997,  obviouslymuch of what  is  going  to  happen, even  if  you were to  run your  optimalmonetary policy, has  already been  "baked in the  cake,"  given theongoing  trends  in  the  economy.  It  seems  to me  that  by the  time youget  to  1998,  you have  had enough time  to  adjust your individualmonetary policies  to  look  at  1998  as  a goal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That's clear  enough.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I find  the distinction  a little  awkward myself,having dealt  with these numbers.  What I have  always  found strange wasthat  no  one  changed the  numbers after  the discussion  at  the  meeting,which may have given people  a clearer impression of  what  the  Committeewas  up  to.  But  the  numbers  stood as  they were, presumably as  numbersthat were based on your  optimal policy prescription.  To  divorce thatfrom what  is possible  in  your minds would seem pretty strained to  me.So,  I take this  as  a matter  of  emphasis  to  remind you  that,  especiallyfor  forecasts that  extend further  out  in  time,  you  should be thinkingabout what you want  to  achieve and not just producing some  forecastbased on  current  conditions, which  is  what some people have  done.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  But  how are  the  numbers characterized  in  theHumphrey-Hawkins  testimony?  My  recollection  is  that  they arecharacterized as  what  the FOMC  expects  to  happen.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Pretty much.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  indicate that  they are  consistent with themonetary ranges  that  the  Committee selected and so  on.  So,  theypresumably are based on  some policy plan.  That  is  what  the Humphrey-Hawkins Act  calls  for.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Don, when you use  the word  "forecast,"  youimmediately put me off  because  it  is  inconsistent with  saying  "goalsand objectives."  In principle,  of  course,  I think we ought  to providenumbers  to  indicate what we are  trying to  achieve  in  1998  and beyondin order  to maintain  the purchasing power of  the dollar.  It  is  simplyinconsistent  to have  the  Congressional Budget Office or theAdministration publish inflation assumptions  through the year 2002  onwhich to  base  a budget without  any information as  to  whether  or notthose  assumptions  are  acceptable  to  us  in  terms  of  the way we  gear  ourpolicies.  If  the numbers  that  go  into  that process  do not  come  fromus,  they  should at  least be  influenced by us.  I would like  to put  outnumbers  on  inflation goals  that  we  intend  to  achieve.  However, as  wehave seen  in  these discussions  before, if  the  number is  to  be  3percent  inflation  for  1998,  I don't  want  to  publish  it.  I have a realproblem with agreeing  to  publish a number if  it  is  one  that  is  going5/21/96-42-to reflect  somebody's  best  guess  as  to  what  the  dynamics of  thisCommittee  and interactions  from some models will  produce rather  than aclear  and attainable goal  for  reducing inflation.My second problem, though not a new one,  is  the  framework.If  we  supply a number  for  inflation, my own number would be 2 percentfor  1998,  and  then the  staff  puts  together a matrix  that  indicates  howmany people would have  to  be thrown out  of  work and how much outputwould have  to  be sacrificed  to  get  to  2 percent  inflation  in  thatyear,  I am not  going  to want  to publish  that either.  Perhaps  thestaff  could at  least  humor those of  us with  analytical  frameworks  thatdiffer  from  the gap or  the NAIRU approach by  including  areasonableness  check.  It  would say that  to  achieve  a goal  forinflation--I will  use  2 percent  in  1998  as  an  illustration--one wouldneed a specified growth in  productivity over  the  interval  to  1998.The  staff  also would indicate  what counterpart  reduction  in  thenatural  rate  of  unemployment would occur  and provide  some  idea of  therate  of  sustained economic  growth  that would be  consistent withreaching  the  inflation goal without  reference  to  the notion of  aPhillips  curve  tradeoff  or  sacrifice  of  output.  Then,  I and perhapsothers  could look at  that  analysis and decide whether  it  was areasonable  approximation of  what was  going  on  in  the economy in  termsof  faster growth in productivity, the  result  of  all  of  the  investmentstaking place, and  faster growth  in capacity than  allowed for  in  thestaff model.  I could decide whether  I was willing to  base policy onit.  At  least  I would have  a range in which to work.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  President Jordan,  I figured  that that  was whatyour GDP  forecast would embody.  Are you asking  the  staff  to  take eachof  the members'  forecasts  and rationalize  them  in  terms  ofproductivity?

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Not  each  one.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Each of  you would have  a different model  anddifferent  relationships.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  No,  but you could do  it  in  terms  of  a range.  Weare  not  talking about a GDP  forecast.  The question is  how much wouldproductivity and capacity have  to  increase  over  and above what youhave  in your assumption to  be  consistent with moving toward 2 percentinflation--whatever unemployment rate  falls out  of  that,  perhaps  aNAIRU of  4-1/2  percent  or whatever, I don't know what  the  number isgoing  to  be--without  sacrificing output  and without creating a gap.  Iknow your  framework  says  that given where  we are,  an  objective  of  2percent  inflation  requires us  to  raise  the unemployment rate  above  theNAIRU and to  reduce  output below potential  to  create a gap.  I don'twant to  do that.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Two points,  President Jordan.  First,  I think Itried to  emphasize  in my  earlier comments  that  your 1998  forecasts  orgoals would not be published for at  least  five years, unless youto  submit written  notes  to explain how you arrived at  a particularconfiguration of  GDP  and inflation.  The staff  would then  be more  thanhappy to  try to  present a fuller  explanation of where  the  goals  camefrom.5/21/96-43-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks, Alan.  I was amused when Don broughtthis  topic up  because  I was  going to  suggest  something like  this,  as  Iand others have  done  in  the past.  It  is  a good  suggestion  in that  itrepresents  a starting point  for a dialogue about  an  issue  that  we needto  talk about  as  a Committee.  I would view  it  just as  a startingpoint.  Ultimately, I think we ought  to  aim  for a longer-run goal withrespect to  inflation, maybe five  years  out  or something  like  that, andwe  ought  to  communicate  that  goal  to  the public.  I would not  expectus  to  get  to  that point  in  this  first  discussion, but  I regard  it  asvery constructive  to  begin the  discussion.  Jerry Jordan touched onthe  reasons why  it  is  so  important.  In my opinion,  one of  the  mostsignificant aspects  is  that,  in circumstances  like the present, wehave  inflation  expectations  that are  quite volatile.  It  seems  to methat  if  people were interpreting  incoming data  against the backdrop ofa central  bank that  had established  some  longer-term goal  for bringinginflation under control,  inflation expectations  might be  lesssensitive  to  the  incoming data.  If ultimately we got  to  the  point  ofcommunicating a reasonable  goal with  respect to  inflation over  thelong  term--I  don't mean necessarily as  a result  of  the discussion wemight  have  at  the July meeting--I  think  that would  increase ourcredibility, assuming we  acted in  the  appropriate  fashion to  deliveron  that goal.  In my view we  are  to  some  extent paying the  price rightnow  for not having such a goal.  The  opportunistic approach we  aretaking  in the  fight  against  inflation  to  achieve our ultimateobjective of  price  stability  is having  an adverse  effect on  ourcredibility.  That  is  reflected  in  expectations  of  higher inflationand interest  rates.  People  are not  certain where we are  headed, andthey are  worried right now  that the  next change  could be  moreinflation, not  less.  In  any event,  I applaud Don  for putting the  ideaon  the  table.  I would support his  proposal.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I share Don'sultimate  goal,  but  I do  not  think that his  recommendation  is  a helpfulway to  get  there.  I believe  that  the  appropriate  goal of  monetarypolicy is price  stability and price stability only.  I further believethat at  some  stage we  have to  define price  stability and  that the bestway  for people to  understand it would be  for  us  to  connect  it  with anumber.  In order  to  have  any notion  that  that  number is  somethingother than what  we  think we  are  likely to  achieve,  given what  is  goingon  in the  economy at  the moment,  we have  to  push  it  out  at  least  threeyears.  And therefore  our number  for  the  second year out  is  an uneasycompromise between what  we think  is  really going  to  happen in relationto  today and what  we are  seeking  to  achieve.  So,  two years  is  tooshort  a period  to be useful  in achieving  an  objective, and  therefore  Ithink  it  would be  counterproductive  to  establish  such an objective.  Iwould much prefer  that we have  an unfettered debate in  July.  I am5/21/96-44-very much in  favor of  a debate  on  the  issue  of where we  think we  oughtto  be  going, but  I would not  complicate  that  debate with a big rowover  who has  1998  right or wrong.  I think that would  obfuscate thereal  issue, which  is whether we  should agree on price  stability as  thegoal  and how we  should define price stability.  So,  I am  in agreementwith where  I think you want  to go  eventually,  Don, but  I  think yourspecific  recommendation is  counterproductive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are you suggesting  1996  and  1997  and2000?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  No,  I would say that,  if  we wantedto  do  this  and we had had  the  debate  beforehand, we would  say the  restof  1996,  1997,  1998,  and 1999.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  I am  trying  to  say is  that  if  youare  looking  for  an  extended period what you want  to  do  is  to eliminatepart  of  the projection.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Yes,  correct.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So  it  could be  1996,  1997,  1999  if  youwanted  to do  it  that way.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  That's  right,  exactly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don't  know how you get  from  your lastforecast  to your  ultimate goal,  but  it's  left  a blank because  that  iswhere  the most  difficult  transition questions  are,  and at  this  pointit  would obscure  the  ultimate goal  to  fill  in  that  blank.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  You  made what  I was  thinkinginfinitely more clear.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I did?  [Laughter]  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I will  repeat  a  little  of whatBill  just  said.  We have  a goal  for  inflation and maybe we  shoulddefine more  clearly what we  mean by price  stability  in the  long  term.Our discussion  so  far  today has  shown  the difficulty  of  putting thatin  1998  terms.  We would spend  a lot  of  time discussing whether wehave  a forecast  or  goal  and not  a lot  of  time  on whether  it  isconsistent with price  stability.  We would be  right  back where we  areanyway.  So,  if  we  go with the  proposal,  I think  it  will  create  moreconfusion  over time  than it  will  provide  clarity.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I think  I am  an  opportunist.  I am proud ofbeing an  opportunist, but  the  thing  I don't know  is  when  theopportunity  is  going  to  present  itself.  We are not  going  to  induce  arecession,  but we know the business  cycle  is  going  to produce  one.When  it  does,  then  inflation will  come  down.  I don't know if  thatwill  occur one  or  two business  cycles  from now.  Perhaps  the year  2000is  a good year  for  a goal;  perhaps  "ultimate" is  another  desirablegoal;  but  I would not use  1998.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.5/21/96-45-

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I agree  with Governor Lindsey.  I think this  isa discussion that we definitely need to  have to  clarify what we meanby price  stability and what  strategy we  have  in  mind to  get  there.  Iam also  concerned, especially given my interest  in an opportunisticstrategy, that  it would be  awfully hard to  fill  in the boxes  relatingto  what  I would expect  in  1998.  If  we extended  the horizon out alittle  longer to,  say,  the year 2000,  I would find it  easier  to  fillin  the boxes and participate  in  our discussion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would  like  to  associate myselfwith Governor Lindsey and Governor Yellen as  an opportunist.  I thinkthere  are a  couple of  other problems with this  exercise.  When we arelooking ahead  in  terms  of  an  expected result,  that  is  a  forecast.  Wecome  out with a point  estimate  forecast  for  that  period  in time.  Ithink  setting  a goal  is  a different  exercise.  For  one  thing, peopleset  goals  differently.  One of  the pleasures  of  my job  is  that  I getto  discuss  goals with  all  12  Reserve  Banks.  They all  have  a differentdefinition of how to  set goals,  and  I don't  know why that  should notbe  true  here.  Some people believe  in  setting a goal  that  involves alot  of  stretch, making  it  literally unachievable,  so  the  issue  is  howclose  they can come  to  it.  Others  like  to  set  goals  that  can beachieved with  just  a reasonable  degree  of  effort.  Both of  thoseapproaches are valid as  long  as  people know which one  is  which, whichone  to  follow.  If  we  tried  to  establish a goal  as  a Committee  of  19people,  I am not  sure  how we would do  it.Secondly, my working vision of  how this  opportunisticapproach works  is  to  get  ourselves,  as we have,  into  a downwardsloping channel.  We  expect  to have  a little  fluctuation inside  thatchannel  with regard  to  the performance  of various  indicators, butinflation would be  pointed downward toward price  level  stability.  Howwe articulate  exactly what  inflation will  be  as  a point estimate  at  afuture point  in  time  using  an opportunistic  strategy is  a  littledifficult  for me  to  conceive.  So,  exactly how one  sets  a goal  in  aquantitative sense  if  one  is  basically  of  an  opportunistic  inclinationis  a little difficult  for me to  see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I agree  that  we  have  to  clarify the  differencebetween a  forecast  and a goal,  and  for  that reason  I agree withGovernor Yellen  that  the  further  out  we  go  in  time, probably  thebetter because  I think  it  will  be  clearer  that we are  talking  about  agoal.  But Mike Kelley also  made the  point,  which obviously  is  a veryimportant one,  that  people  set goals  in  different ways.  That  is  oneof  the  things  that  would come out  in a discussion about  whatassumptions people  made when  they  set  the  goal,  whether  it  reallyinvolved  a stretch  or whether  it  was  something that  they felt  wasachievable.  I realize  this  could be  a difficult  exercise.  We  have19  different people  coming  at  it,  but  I believe we may learn  somethingin  the process.  I think  a discussion would be useful.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  This  is  an  idea  that we  ought  to  pursue.  I don'tknow  if  Don's  suggestion is  optimal,  but we  have  to  start  somewhere.5/21/96-46-I also  think that we need to  start  with at  least  some structure.  Inthis case  I don't  think it's  critical whether we use a 1998-type  goalor push the  goal  out a little  in  time.  We have  to  start with somestructure and some  process because many of  the  questions  that havebeen raised around the  table have  suggested, at  least  to me,  thatthere  are a lot of  very difficult  issues  involved here.  While wemight agree  that we  are all  in  favor of  price  stability, we need toget beyond  that  general  notion and decide  what price  stability meansand, practically  speaking, how we  should go  about  implementing it,over what  timeframe,  and so  forth.  Those are difficult  questions.They will  get even more difficult  as we  really start  to  contemplatethem, and  it  seems  to me  that  we  ought  to get  our  feet wet  somehow.What Don  is proposing strikes me as  a reasonable way to  get  started.We will see what  kind of  issues  surface;  we will  see what we  learnfrom  this;  and we may  see how we  can address  issues  like anopportunistic versus deliberate  approach to  disinflation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I don't have any disagreement with what  Don  isrecommending, and I think  it  can be done  in  terms  of what  one  sets asa policy objective  for  a year  like  1998.  We use  policy rules  at  theSan Francisco Bank.  We have some  idea  about what we  think pricestability means,  and I think we would be able  to  do what  Don isproposing quite easily.  In  a way it  does put  the  cart before  thehorse because  the  real  discussion is  about what we as  a Committee meanby price stability and  over what  timeframe we  should seek  to  achieveit.  Since we  haven't  been able  to  talk  about  that  for  10  or  11  years,[Laughter]  if  Don's proposal  gets  us  closer to  it,  I am all  for  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would anyone else  like  to  add to  thisdiscussion?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I agree with Gary Stern.  I think  this  is  anice  initiative.  In my view, it's  very important  to  start  somewhere,and  I am very glad that Don has  suggested this  and put  it  on  thetable.  I also agree with  some  of  the  other comments,  though,  in  thesense  that  I think  focusing  in  a fairly unstructured way on  1998  isnot  the  way to  go.  I believe we  need to  have a longer-term horizon.I would also  suggest,  Don,  that  the  staff needs  to put  some  structureon  this  kind of  policy discussion just  as  you do  on  our long-termpolicy deliberations.  The  form that  it  usually  takes  is  some  set  ofalternatives.  You do  that  with simulations  to  a degree already, but  Iam  thinking  about  something that  would be more  structured  in  terms  ofa goal.  That might  beg some questions  about what price  stability is,but  that's  okay because we  need to  confront  those  one way or  anotherin  any case.  If  I may be  a little more  specific,  it  might be  useful,say, with  a horizon that  runs  out  to  the  year 2000,  to  flesh out howyou might  interpret an opportunistic  strategy under  certain kinds  ofassumptions and what  that might mean  in terms  of  some price measurelike  the CPI.  Perhaps  as  another alternative, you might  add  somethingthat  is  a little more  like  our  traditional  inflation  targeting withmore  specific  numerical  goals,  year by year.  That  kind of  structuremight allow us  to  get  a little  more quickly to  some  of  the  questionswith which we really need to  grapple.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Minehan.5/21/96-47-

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  There was  a wonderful  quote  by Ed  Boehne in  theresearch paper that  we got  on  opportunistic strategies.  It  went  alongthese  lines:  Well, we  are where we  are;  sooner or  later we will  havea recession;  we don't want  a recession;  but  if  we can work things  in away that  takes  advantage  of  the  inroads  that we have made  againstinflation  and hold  the  line  to  the next  cycle,  then we will  achieve  apattern of  every cycle having  lower rates  of  inflation than  theprevious  cycle,  even at  the  cycle peaks.  To me  that  is  the  operativedefinition of  an  opportunistic strategy, but  it  raises  the  issue  ofwhether  or not we can  sit  down  and say,  okay, by  the year  2000  Ianticipate  that  we will  have had at  least  one recession and have madethe  same inroads  into  inflation that  we  made  in the  last recession.Therefore, my goal  for  the year 2000  is  2 percent  inflation  ratherthan 3 percent.  I find that  level  of precision  difficult  to  dealwith.  We need  to have  this  discussion about what we mean by pricestability.  Does  a price  stability goal mean holding  the  line where weare  and  taking advantage of  opportunities  to  get  inflation  lower, ordoes  it  mean some  forward-looking policy  to drive  inflation down withall  that  implies  about  how we measure  it.  There are  a lot  of  issueshaving  to do with what are we talking about when we discuss  inflationmeasures.  We know  there are  a lot  of  problems with  the CPI.  Whatnumber are we going  to  look at  when we  say we have  achieved victory?It's  only part  of  the discussion, but  I think we need to  have  it.  Idon't  know whether  all  of  us  giving you a specific numberincorporating a lot  of  different assumptions  in  "X" year has  to  be  theway we  start.  We need  to  start talking about  this,  though.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I agree  with President Minehan.  I think  itwill  be useful  to  have  the  discussion.  I generally prefer an  open-ended,  longer horizon  for  a goal, but  starting the  discussion is  whatis  important.  We need  to  have  some  kind of  discussion about  whatprice  stability means  and what  time  horizon we  are talking about,  andif  what  gets  us  started  is  thinking about  1998,  that's okay with me.My preference would be  to  base  the  discussion on  a longer-term horizonthan  1998,  but  I think getting  started  is more  important.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I hope  that we  can  have  two  discussions.  I wouldset  aside  the  question of  strategy and discuss  it  sometime  laterbecause  I think  the  two  different approaches  to  strategy raise  a lotof  other  issues.  So,  confining  the discussion  to  our  goals  andobjectives and  the  time  period  for  achieving  them would be  veryuseful.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I  think the discussion would be  quite useful.But  starting  it with a number  doesn't  strike me  as  the way  to  do  it.We ought  to  have  a broader discussion on  the  issue  of price  stability,what we mean by  it,  and how we can  get  there.  I think that  if  we havethe  substantive discussion,  then  numbers will  fall  out.  But  if  wereverse  the  order,  I think we will  end up  with a heavily philosophicaldiscussion.  So,  I support the  notion of having  a discussion andfocusing  on the  substantive question, and  I would leave  the  issue  ofnumbers  for a  later date.5/21/96-48-
