CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody  like  to  open  the  meetingby making a motion  to  approve  the minutes?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  I'll  call  on  PeterFisher  for  a report  on  foreign  currency operations.  Peter.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  [Statement--see Appendix]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Peter, you mentioned communication.  Most  ofthe  research  I've  seen  suggests  that  intervention  like  this,  if  it  hasan effect,  it's mainly by way of  communicating  future  likely policyactions.  With  that  in mind, what  do you  think  the prospects  for  thedollar would be  if we  did not  follow through  at  this  point with prettystrong policy actions?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The dollar  would trade  off.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Significant downside risk  or--

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It's very hard to  put  a number  on  that.  Let  mestart  by saying  that  if  the Committee does  something in  the range  ofwhat  the market  is  expecting,  I'm not  sure  the  dollar will move upvery abruptly.  I think  it  will  tend to  pip up  and pip  down a  littlebit  as  has happened with previous  actions  of  the  Committee.  I thinkinaction by the  Committee could have  a downside risk  to  the  dollar.The market  is  fairly neutral  at  this  point.  In  the interbank  sense,its position  is  such  that  inaction could  result  in  significant dollarsales.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  This  is  really a  follow-up question.  Acoordinated intervention  like  the  one  in  which we participated on May4 carries  with it  the message  that  there was  communication  takingplace about  fundamentals.  Everybody knows  there was  intervention withcoordination.  Can you  share with us what  the nature  of  thatcommunication was among  the central  banks and ministries  of  finance,and whether  the market  correctly perceived what  that  communication wasabout?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  I think that  the morning of  May  4 began withPresident Tietmeyer's  release  of  his  statement  that  they did not  havean interest  in  seeing  the mark overvalued  against  the  dollar.  Oneconsultation in  which  I was  engaged was  a discussion of  the nature  ofthe  dollar's  reaction  to  the  mark and that  it  seemed to  move  awfullyquickly and without  regard  to  where people  thought  interest  rates  weregoing  in  each  of  the  countries.  The  nature  of  the  disturbance  in theexchange market  was  the  focus  of  my discussions  with most  of  the  othercountries  that  I consulted with--I  consulted with my counterparts  in5/17/94the  G-7  central banks  and a few others.  When I say  "disturbed" marketconditions,  I'm referring  to  April  29  when very seasoned professionalswere unable  to  get  business  done, unable  to  get phones picked up, andwhere  the  exchange market was  not  responding to  fundamentals  in  thesense of  the  direction of  interest  rates  being pretty well  laid outfor  them  and they seemed to  get caught  in  other backwashes  in the

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  President Jordan,  just  to  amplify on  what  Petersaid, since you referred to  the  finance ministries,  the  principalconsultations  initially were between us  and the  Treasury Department,and between  the  Chairman and  President  Tietmeyer  on  the  day before hisstatement.  These  consultations  were  followed up by  some  discussionsabout whether the  Bundesbank felt  it  was  appropriate  to  join in  acoordinated operation.  It  was  only on  the morning of May 4 that  therewere  any additional  consultations with the Japanese along with theother central banks.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I assume that market participants  don't  know themagnitude  of  the  intervention.  I don't  know how well  they can guessat  those  things,  but  when  I saw the  amount  that  the Germans  did and astatement by Mr. Issing,  I read  that  as  a lack  of  enthusiasm for  thebusiness.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Well,  I guess  that's  right,  but I can tell youthat  the  Bundesbank Directorate did  discuss  this  operation.  WhetherMr.  Issing was present at  that  discussion I do not  know.  But both Mr.Tietmeyer's  statement--the  excerpts  from  his  speech, which weredeliberately released early--and the  size of  the  Bundesbank  operationwere discussed by  the Bundesbank Directorate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let  me  just add  that  I've  had a numberof  conversations with Mr.  Tietmeyer.5/17/94

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  There was  a press  commentary after  the May 4action--I  don't remember  its  precise contents--but people  in  theTreasury and in  the Administration more generally  supposedly viewedthe  action as  an alternative  to  domestic monetary policy actions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  issue never  came up,  at  least  not  inmy conversations.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Peter,  given what  the  Chairman just  said,  whichI agree with, and given what you  said--that  even if  our policy movesalong the  lines  of market  expectations,  there's not going  to  be upwardmovement  in  the  dollar--that  opens  the question as  to  what  is  next  andmeans  that we may  have  another run  on the  dollar.  How  long do youexpect the  latest  intervention  to  hold?  I suppose  the  interventionlast August  bought us  9 or  10  months.  I assume  the  secondintervention will buy  something  less  than  9 or  10  months.  Do we haveany ammunition left?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  With regard  to  the  risk  for  the  dollar goingforward, I would again  focus  on  the dollar/yen exchange  rate.  I thinkthe  operation and the  action of  the  Bundesbank last week and whateverthe  Committee does  in  the  realm of  the  expected, if  I can put  it  thatway, will  tend to  stabilize  the  dollar/mark rate.  I don't  see  any bigdownward potential  in  the  dollar/mark rate  on  its  own  terms.  The yen,though, will  be  the  locus  of  attention particularly in  the  run-up tothe G-7  Summit  this  summer.  That  puts us  back in  the politicalcontext,  and whether  the Administration maintains  its  currentformulation or  reverses  I think  is  a bigger  risk  for  the dollar.However,  if  the  dollar can get  through  the G-7  Summit  roughly  at  itscurrent  level  against  the  yen,  then  I may be  sticking my head way out5/17/94but  I would  see  slightly greater  odds  for  dollar  strength thereafterthan dollar weakness.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Does  the potential  reversion, which hopefullywe won't  have,  that  you mentioned involve  foreign policy  issues  ordoes  that  include monetary policy statements?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I'm not  quite  reading you.  The monetary policyby the  Administration or--

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Yes,  in  other words  dollar bashing beingforeign exchange  statements, how about  Fed bashing being monetarypolicy statements.  If  there  were  a recurrence  of  the  former, wouldthat be harmful?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That  will  tend to  disturb the  foreign exchangewas  that  by Mr. Altman to  the  effect  that  he had no  argument with theFed  over  interest  rates.  That  really  came  on  the  heels  of  theTietmeyer  comment;  that  was  a very useful  setting  for  the operation.So obviously, yes,  if  some of  that Administration enthusiasm for  thecurrent  Fed policy were  lost,  that would  tend  to  be  destabilizing tothe  dollar.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  How about  Congressional  statements?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think  they are more  expected by  the  foreignexchange market  than Administration statements;  they may be  in thesame vein but  I don't  think they have  the  same  effect.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Peter,  I have  a variation on Al  Broaddus'squestion.  As you  know, the  Europeans  have been somewhat concernedabout  the  effect  of  our  actions  on  their  long-term rates.  Does  theaction  today  that  it  would have an upward effect  on  European  rates  orhave  their actions  sufficiently decoupled their  rates  from ours?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  if  the  history of  the  last  three  or  fourmonths  is  my guide,  I'd have  to  say I would expect  an  impact  on  theirlong end.  It's  hard  to  imagine  there won't be  some  such  impact.  Ithink,  though,  that we have  seen more  decoupling  in this  period--between  the  last  meeting and now--than we saw  in previous periods.So,  in  that  sense  I can be  modestly hopeful  that  there would not be anegative  impact on  their  long  end.  I think  the  Bundesbank's actionslast  week are probably going  to be  the  most helpful  in  that regard.After  the moves  in mid-April  had tended to  squeeze  out  expectations  ofrate  reductions,  they have  been put  back  in with  last  week's  actionand  that  may help decouple  European rates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, any  further  questions?  If  not,would somebody  like  to  move  to ratify  the  actions  of  the  Foreign Desksince  the  last meeting?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So  move.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.5/17/94-5-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Joan Lovett.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Joan?  Jerry.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Before  February when we started  to  announce  ouractions,  it  was  standard practice  in  the  daily program  to  protest afederal  funds  rate move away  from the  intended rate,  maybe  sometimesgoing against what you  saw as  the  reserve needs  of  the  currentmaintenance period.  Since February we've  announced our decisionsthree  times,  but  in monitoring  the Call  over the  eight weeks  since theappeared that  you  still  needed  to protest  a rate  to  indicate  thatpolicy  had not  changed even  in  the absence  of  an  announcement.  Itsounded  like  the  Street still  thinks  that  there  is  a possibility thatwe  could change  the  funds  target without  announcing the  change  andtherefore your daily program still  has  to  account  for  that.  Is  thatright?  And what  would help  to  clarify  the  situation  for you?

[SECTION]

MS. LOVETT.  Well,  I think that  what  really  is  at  stake  isthat  while  we have  announced the  changes  that we have  made,  the marketstill  sees  itself  as  always  looking  for when we're going  to  make  achange  in  the  future.  On  occasions  when  they think we will  or  weshould,  they move  the  funds  rate  up  immediately in  the morning wellbefore  any kind of  an  announcement by  the Committee would be  likely.And  the rate  sits  there until  we demonstrate something  to  thecontrary.  And so  on a couple  of  occasions where  the market  thoughtthe  data were  such  that perhaps  there was  going to  be  an  action  incoming days,  they moved the  funds  rate up  to  reflect  that  possibility.Part  of  the  theory that  seems  to  be  at  work  there  is  that  if  peoplereally believe  that  the Fed will  move,  for  some  it  means buying cheapfunds  relative  to  what  they will  be  later.  Moving  the  funds  rate alsois  a way of  testing  the Fed  to  see what  its  stance  is.  And so  eventhough we  recently have announced  our policy actions,  what we  respondto  is  the  market moving  ahead  of  our  announcement  of  Fed policyactions.  I think  that's  always  going to  happen.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Are  there  still  people  out  there who  think wemight change  the  intervention  level  on  the  funds  rate  without anannouncement?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Yes,  there  are  some people  who still  thinkthat's  a possibility;  it  hasn't  been ruled out  because we  havementioned  that  these  announcements have not  necessarily been for  alltime.  I think  the  market  tends  to  set up  for  itself  a series  of  timepoints.  It  looks  for  announcements  on the  discount  rate now within  acertain  period of  time  in  the morning, policy announcements  any timeafter  that,  but  always  the possibility of  something being  signaledahead of  the  announcement.  Even  if  that  is  not  forthcoming, there  arecircumstances  when they move  the  funds  rate  ahead of  the Fed.  Forexample,  on  the  day of  the  employment data  release on  Friday, May  6,most people  didn't  think that  the Fed would  take action  that  day, butthey still  moved  the  funds  rate up  on  the  theory  that perhaps  theFederal  Reserve  would do  something  on the  following Monday.  And  thusthe  constellation of  where the  funds  rate would be  over  the  balance  ofthe  period suggested  that  it  was worth pushing the  rate up.5/17/94-6-

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  If  they've  come  to believe that  all  increases  inthe  funds  rate  will  be  accompanied by an  announcement,  then theabsence  of  an  announcement would seem  to  lessen  the need to protest.A protest  action would occur  if  you saw  a need to  drain  reserves  butyou  felt  you had to  add  reserves because  the  funds  rate  was  too high.Shouldn't  the  absence  of  an  announcement, which would indicate  thatthe  funds rate  target has  not  changed,  have the  same effect  as  yourprotest move?  When you do your protest  move you're going  to  have  towind up  taking more back out  than you otherwise  would.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Well,  I guess  it's  really their  anticipatorymoves  that we're  talking about;  it's  not  the actual  Fed moves;  it'sthe market  anticipating the  Fed moves before  they occur.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Well, what's  the  difference between  our  failureto  issue  a press  release and a protest  action by  the  Desk?

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Perhaps with  the  passage  of  time,  as  peoplebecome  accustomed to  our new disclosure  practices,  those  anticipatorymoves will  not  require  our protest  actions.  But we're  always  going tohave anticipatory moves;  I think  that's  a given.  How the market  wouldview our absence  from protesting  I think would require more  experiencewith our new disclosure practices.  I don't  think there's  enoughexperience with them now  for  the market  to be  confident  that,  had westayed out when they pushed  the  funds  rate a point  higher, we were  notpaving the way  for  the  Committee.  We're not  in the position  to pavethe  way  for  the  Committee.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The day before  the  March FOMC meeting  nobodyexpected us  to  change policy  that  day or  to announce  a  change  that  daybut  funds were  still high.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  And if we had not  gone  in,  that  would have lookedas  if  the  decision  somehow had been made ahead  of  the meeting.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Or  that  we  were  trying  to  get  the  market  readyfor  it--to pave the  way for  a decision.  I think that  there  just  hasnot been  enough experience with  the  announcements  for people  to  feelcomfortable  in  terms  of  what the  timing  of  those  announcements  is  andso  forth.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I would hope  that  over  time  one  of  the benefitsof  announcing would be  the  leeway  to  allow the  funds rate  to  move  on adaily basis  over  a little wider  range without worrying about  anincorrect perception of  current  policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That's  one of  the  advantages  ofannouncing.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Joan,  just  a  quick question.  What  is  yourestimate  of  the  Treasury balance  shortfall?5/17/94

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  Well,  relative to  our expectations  on  the Apriltax  collection  themselves, we  fell  short  by $12  billion.  And if  wetake April  and May  combined there was  a big catchup  in  early May.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MS.  LOVETT.  They only fell  short  by about  $9 billion.  Wehad  forecast  an  increase  in  the April  tax take  of  something  in  theneighborhood of  25  percent  over  the  level  a year  ago and  it  appears  tobe  coming  in  between 5 and  10  percent  above.  Everyone seems  to  havehad those  same kinds  of  overestimates,  so  people  are still  trying tofind  out  if  there will be  some  offsets  in June  or  whether in  fact  allthese  adjustments were made  last  year and people really did get  aheadof  the  change  in  their tax liabilities.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  there  are  no further  questions, wouldsomebody  like  to move to  ratify  the  actions  of  the  Desk  since  the  lastmeeting?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let's  now move on  toMessrs. Truman  and  Prell.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for either  gentleman?

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  I have  a question  about the  inflationnumbers:  Last year at  this  time we  had an unpleasant  inflationsurprise.  This  year it  seems,  if  you  look at  the  year-over-yearcomparisons  at  least,  that  the  consumer  inflation  numbers  are  comingin  somewhat  below the  forecast.  Part  of  that  is  probably due  torecent  changes  in  the  seasonal  factors  for  the CPI,  but  that probablyis  not  a complete explanation;  I don't think  it  is.  Is  there  someperspective as  far  as  that development  is  concerned that  ought  to  bebrought  into  this  discussion?  I know you cited the  6-month  inflationrates  and  they don't  look quite as  favorable.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Well,  clearly,  I was  trying  to  suggest  that  forsomeone who wanted  to  look  for evidence  that  things  were not  going  sowell.  We  do  still  regard  these  longer  trends  in  the  indexes  as  quiterelevant  to  gauging  the behavior  or  the  direction of  inflation.  Lastyear,  to  be  sure,  the  spurt  that we  saw was,  it  appears now,considerably a matter  of  seasonal  adjustment problems.  Looking  backnow, things  don't  appear quite  so  bad.  Our recent experience has  beena  shade better  than we  anticipated a  few months  ago.  The  very latestdata  aren't  any better  than  anticipated.  If  there has  been  some goodnews  recently,  it's been on  the  labor  cost  side.  The  employment  costindex  in  the  first  quarter was  considerably lower  than we  hadanticipated, and in  our view that  sets  the world  right  in  a sense.  Asyou  know, we had wondered a bit  about  why ECI  increases  had leveledout  last year  in  the  face of  unemployment  rates  considerably higherthan  they  are now, the  substantial  reduction in  the  current  inflation,and to  some  degree  in  shorter-run  inflation expectations.  So,  we  givesome  credence  to  those  numbers  and it  has  led us  to  trim  a little  off5/17/94our wage  forecast  or  our total  compensation forecast  on  the  benefitsside  going  forward.  And so we  are reasonably comfortable  that,  if  theeconomy  follows  the path we're  talking  about,  the  inflation  trend willremain  stable  to perhaps  a shade  lower.  But  I did want  to  highlightsome  risks  and certainly to underscore  our view  that  the  room tomaneuver here  in terms  of  faster  growth  than we're projecting  seems  tous  rather  limited,  if  one  really is  concerned about  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Did you  say that  the  very latest  data are  inaccord with expectations?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Current CPI.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Well,  the  thing  I'm thinking about  is  that  the2.4  percent  change  in the  total  CPI  over  the  past  12  months  and the2.7  or 2.8  percent  change  in  the  core  rate  over  the  same period are  alittle better  than expectations.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes,  for  the  total  over recent  months, we'redoing somewhat better.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mike, you indicated  that you thought  there mightbe some  significant  revision  in the  first-quarter GDP number  when weget  the  revision.  Will  that  be  at  the  end of  this  month?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Would you  share  that with us?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  I can  address  this  on  two  levels.  One issimply  the arithmetic  of  plugging  in  the  actual  data that  are nowavailable  in  place  of  the  assumptions  that  the  BEA had made.  And thisis  primarily  data  that have  changed on  inventories, retail  sales,  andconstruction.  On net,  those  numbers would  seem to  chop  a goodpercentage point  off  of  the  2.6 percent  GDP growth  rate  that wasestimated  initially.  Now, we're  anticipating that  some  of  theincoming data, particularly  on  trade, perhaps will  come  in better  thanBEA had assumed.  And ultimately, perhaps  on  the  next  round  ofrevisions when  there are  some  further  changes,  for  example,  inconstruction,  we may get  closer  to  the  2.6  percent.  So,  notionally,in  framing  this  forecast we've been  thinking that  GDP  in  the  firstquarter was  probably a little  less  than  the  2.6  percent,  probably 2percent plus  rather  than what  the  incoming data just  mechanicallywould suggest.  And  then we made  an  estimate of,  in  essence,  the  bestchange  for  the  second  quarter,  and that's  what gives us  an estimate  ofsomething  over 3 percent  for  the  first half.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Thank  you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  There has been  a  fair amount  of  discussion  aboutcapacity--how much  of  it  we have  left  before we have  inflationarypressures--and about  the  growth potential  of  the  economy.  Most  of5/17/94these estimates, particularly  the  growth potential,  can  change withseemingly small  changes  in  assumptions,  like  labor  force  participationrates,  productivity  increases,  and that sort  of  thing.  I presume  thatyou are thinking of  a capacity growth rate of  maybe 2-1/2  percent  orlikely to  be on  the  high end of  a range  like  that or  on  the  low end,given the  recent  trends  in labor participation  and what  appears  to  befairly strong  capital  spending, especially equipment  spending?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Our working  assumption is  that,  in  the near  term,potential  output growth  is  about 2-1/2  percent.  I think one mighttake a more  optimistic view of  the  underlying productivity trend--assign more of  the  increase we've seen  over  the past  few years  toperhaps  sustainable underlying trend growth,  as  opposed  to  the  normalcyclical  component.  But we think  that's going  out  on  a limb a bit atthis point.  We've already  assumed a considerable pickup  in  trendproductivity  growth from what we were  experiencing prior  to  the  1990s.On  the  labor  force side,  we haven't  seen much  lift yet  in  labor  forceparticipation and the  population trends  are  very hard to  read.  It'sconceivable  that the  trend  in  labor  force  growth isn't  even  quite  sostrong as  we've anticipated, which  is not  robust by historicalstandards.  We  feel  that  the  2-1/2 percent  potential  is  a reasonableworking assumption.  We  don't advocate  that  the  Committee  take  thatnumber as  gospel  and make  its policies  on  that  assumption  and closeits  eyes  to  the  incoming evidence.  But  we  think  that's a reasonableestimate  for  now.I must  say  that,  for  example,  in  a recent  Business  Weekarticle there  was much talk  about  how the world was  changing in  termsof  productivity growth, and I think  high-tech  investment  is  one  of  theelements  in  that story.  In  quantitative  terms,  the net  investmentfrom  that  kind of  equipment  isn't  very  large because  it's  rathershort-lived;  it  turns  over  relatively rapidly.  So  the  capital  stockin  that  sense  isn't  growing very rapidly.  But  if  you believe  that  itis  affording  firms  the  opportunity to  reorganize  in major ways  the waythey do  things  and is  really creating disproportionate  efficiences  ina sense,  then  I think you can make a case  for  stronger growth.  Theother thing  I found puzzling in  that  article was  that  it  said becauseof  all of  this,  one needn't worry so much about  inflation.  And thekey argument  it  made was  that  if  there were  pressures,  firms  wouldjust  ship production  abroad.  Well,  that's  a rather puzzling argument.It  says basically that  you  can avoid inflation by  sucking in  imports,but  that doesn't  really enhance domestic  economic growth in  the  GDPsense.  So,  I think there's  some  loose  thinking behind some  of  themore optimistic  stories.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  First,  to  follow-up  on Bob Parry's  questionabout  the  inflation statistics,  the  first  four months  of  1993  wereinitially reported as  averaging 4.3  percent.  We  use a thing  that  wecall  the median CPI  as  an  alternative to  the  CPI  less  food and energyto  try to  monitor what  these numbers are  telling us  as  the  yearunfolds.  We were  getting 3.6  percent  for  those  first  four monthsversus the  official  4.3  percent.  Now that  they've  revised theseasonals,  they're reporting  the  first  four months  of  last  year at  3.4percent;  that  brought  it  back close  to  where we were.  For  the  firstfour months  of  this  year,  we're getting 2.9  versus  the 2.3  percent.5/17/94-10-So as  an  exercise  as  to what  the  seasonals  did, I had  the  staff  applylast year's  seasonal  factors  to  the  first  four months  of  this  year,and that would have  produced a 3.1  percent rate  for  those months,  thesame  range  as where  the median  is.  That tells  me  that  .8  would haveto  be  redistributed over  the  subsequent  eight months  of  the  year if  wewere  still  operating with  the  last  year's  seasonals.  Now, I don'tknow whether the  new seasonals  are  truth or  not, but  I do  know thatother  things  the  same  in  the  raw component, the  final  eight months  ofthe year will  have a higher  inflation  rate,  and I don't  know whichmonths  the  seasonals  stole  from.  But  it  biases me  toward  saying  thatit's more  likely for higher  inflation numbers  to  get reported ratherthan  lower from  this point.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  President  Jordan,  let me just  say that wehave no  reason  to  think  that  this  hasn't  been a distinct  improvementin  the  seasonal  adjustment.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Right,  I don't  disagree;  it's  closer  to  themedian,  though.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  actually,  the median  generally has  beenrunning very close  to  the regular  core  inflation number  over  the  pastyear.  They are  almost  identical  on a 12-month basis.  But  the  keyhere  is  that  I don't  see  on  technical  grounds  a reason to  be veryconcerned at  this point  that,  in  essence, the  recent data have beenoverstating  the  degree of  deceleration  and  that we're going  to  get avast  surprise later on  simply because  the  adjustment  in  the  seasonalfactors  has been overdone.  The methods  seem to  us  to  be reasonable:We  consulted with them  during the  process  of  their  revisions,  anddon't  believe that  they  really are missing  significant  residualseasonalities.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Well,  I think  that  the median  and  the  so-called"core"  track very well, within a  couple  of  tenths,  most  of  the  timeand  furthermore over  longer periods  of  time  the median  and the  actualCPI  come  out  to  be virtually  identical,  but  the median  for  these  fourmonths  currently  is  running  2.9,  and  I have more confidence  in  thatthan  I do  in  the  2.3  that was  reported  for  the  first  four monthsbecause  the  core  is  2.7  for  those  months.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Yes,  but  that's  splitting hairs  in  terms  of  themeasurement  accuracy.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Well,  not  quite  because remember  last year  wegot  the  dip  in  the  latter months  of  year  as  initially  reported;  thosegot  revised,  too.  If  the  median is  telling  the  truth  and we have  hadfour  months  of  2.3  and  it's  really going to  average out  2.9  over theyear,  then  it's  going  to  have  to  be running a  few months up  in  therange of  3.3  to  3.4.  We  just  have  to  expect  that  that's  the way  thenumbers will work out.  This  is  not  saying what's right  or  wrong butthat  this  is  the way  the  statistics  were kept.The  other question  is  about  the  Greenbook.  I try hard toassess  what  I think about  the  economy versus what  the  Greenbook saysand use  the  latter  as  a  starting point  to  understand  the  logic  of howpolicy plays  into  the  numbers  that  you provide us with.  And  I havegotten  sort  of comfortable  with the  familiar reversion pattern  thatwhatever happens--the  surprises  in the  fourth-quarter  of  1993  and  the5/17/94-11-fourth-quarter  of  1992 were  on  the  up side but  we  had a weak  firsthalf  of  last  year--there's a  tendency for  real  output  to  revert  oversome period or horizon to  some  idea  of potential  capacity.  And thatgoes  in both directions;  it's  symmetrical.  The  CPI projections  tendto  revert  to  something under  3 percent  out  there  someplace,  so  thatgives  us nominal.  As  I read this  Greenbook  the  logic  of  the policylinkages  seemed to  be  clear,  but  I want your  response  on  two  things.One,  am  I getting it  right?  Second, where  is  the vulnerability?  Thatis,  increases  in  short-term interest  rates hold down, you  say, bondand equity prices which  in  turn  influence real  output, namelyinvestment  spending including  residential and nonresidentialinvestment  spending.  And as  people  see  the  effects  of  that  long rateon output,  that  influences  inflation expectations  as  the economyconverges on potential,  and  that  finally influences what  actual  CPIinflation  turns  out  to  be.  So  is  that  a  correct characterization ofthe  linkages  and, if  so,  where  is  it  vulnerable?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Well,  I think it's  pretty close with the minorexception  that  I would suggest  that,  in  terms  of  the  inflationforecast,  the behavior  that  we're predicting  is  not  simply a  functionof  expectations but  also  of  our  judgment  that  the  output pathproducing  the unemployment  rate and capacity utilization  rates  leavesa modest  amount  of  slack in  the system.  So  that  force  is  tending  totamp  down wage and price  increases.  In  terms  of  the  risks  in  thisoutlook,  they are  so  numerous  and disparate  that  it's  hard to  knowwhere  to begin.  That  isn't particularly different  from any otherforecast.  This may be  one  of  the  reasons  why the markets  seem sounsettled and volatile;  and like  many other  forecasters we have  a hardtime,  in  light  of  the dramatic  reversal  of  the bond market,  judgingwhere  the equilibrium may be.  The market  movements  have been veryfast  and very  large,  and judging  what  the  impact  will  be as  we moveforward  several  months  or quarters  is  a very tricky  business.As  I suggested,  there  are  considerable  differences of  opinionamong private  forecasters and we  think  they mirror  some  of  theseuncertainties.  On  the  one hand,  there  is  a view  that we  are  in  themidst  of  what  will be  a dramatic  and very well  sustained capitalspending boom  that will  interact  in  some  sense  on  the  trade  side wherewe will  be very  competitive.  In  that  view, as  these  foreign economiespick up, we  will  see  tremendous  increases  in  exports,  and this  kind oflift will  provide  the  income  to  support  a healthy rate  of  consumerspending right  on  through  1995.  On the  other side,  there  are  thosewho  are beginning  to  find  some  hints  of  weakness  here  and there;  theythink  the  higher  rates  that we  have,  assuming  they are  sustained, willhave  an even more  serious  damping  effect on  the  housing  sector  andthat  consumer demand will  be damped not  only by that  but  also  by theeffects  of  the  tax  increases  beyond what we had  anticipated.  They  seethat  saving  is  already at  a low  level,  that  we've already  seenincreases  in debt  and probably will  have more  ahead, so  consumers mayfeel more  constrained down  the  road.  And certainly even with therecent better  news  there are  those who  are  skeptical  about how quicklythe  foreign economies  will  come  on and thus  what  kind of  impetus we'llbe  getting  in  the  next  few quarters  from a diminished drag on  thetrade  side.  So  that's  sort  of  a range  of  some  of  the  thinking  that  Isee,  and  there  certainly are  elements  of  risks  in  those  directions  inour view.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  My  question has  beenanswered.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mike,  in  the  same  vein as  Jerry's  question,  itseems  to  me  that much of  the  overall  profile  of  the projection dependson  the  idea  that  the  recent  run-up  in  long  rates  is  going  to  restrainthe  economy  in the  future.  In  that  context--I  know you think  thatmost  of  the  recent  increase has been  real--I would be  interested  inknowing particularly with regard  to  the  30-year Treasury bond rate,which  is  currently about  7-1/2  percent,  roughly how much of  that  youthink  is  real.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  if  I take  the  base as  last October's  lowwhen the  rate was  about  5.8  percent,  that's  an  increase  of  some  170basis points,  if  I've  done my arithmetic correctly.  I would judgethat more than  half  of  that  is  real.  That's  a seat  of  the  pantsjudgment and  I can't point  to  any clear-cut  analytical  support  for  it.I certainly see  nothing  in  changes  in  inflation  forecasts  going outthe  short  distance  for which most professional  forecasters' resultsare  available;  and nothing in  the  household surveys  indicates  that  thelonger-range  inflation  expectations have risen  dramatically.  Lookingat  stock market  behavior  and trying  to  intuit  something  about what mayhave happened to  the  real  returns  that  are built  in there,  I see  asignificant element  that must have  been  real  as  opposed to  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I'm  just  trying  to  pin it  down a  little more.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  In  looking  at  the  behavior  in  the  housing market,as  limited as  the  evidence  is  at  this point, people  have not  on  theevidence dismissed  these higher  rates  as  being simply a  reflection  ofhigher  inflation in  terms  of  what  they might  expect  for  their wages  orfor house prices  going  forward.  We wouldn't  have  seen  as  much  effectas  we have  perhaps  if  there really had been  that  kind of  inflammationof  inflation expectations.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  But would you  say that  currently,  taking  the30-year  bond rate,  that maybe  4 percentage points  of  it  is  real?  Am Idoing my arithmetic  right?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  looking  out  over  a  5- to  10-year  span, Iguess I would be more  comfortable asserting  that market  expectationswould be  on  the  order  of  4 percent  inflation.  They could be  a  littlelower, but  that  would leave  the  real  rate  a  little  lower  than  it  hasbeen.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  backward-looking survey indicators  containedin  the  financial  indicators  package put  real  rates  at  3 to  4 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Wouldn't 4 percent be on  the  high  sidehistorically for  the  longest  real  rate?  That's  really what  I'm tryingto  get at.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes,  except  for  the  1980s;  the  rate  is  about whereit  was  for  much of  the  1950s  and  1960s.5/17/94-13-

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  But by  longer-term  standards,  it  would bequite  high I think.  I tried  to  figure  that out  in  the  current--

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Indeed,  that's  one  of  the  reasons,  given  ourassumption  that  there will  be at  least mild  fiscal restraint  and  thatinflation  expectations  will be  going down,  I think  there  is  adiscernible downside risk  to  our bond yield forecast;  we  have itreally not getting much below 7 percent  by the  latter  half  of  1995.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for  the  gentlemen?  Ifnot,  would somebody  like  to  start  the  Committee  discussion?

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our District continuesto  be healthy.  Housing has remained very strong, although many nowexpect  that  perhaps  some  slowing will  come with higher  interest rates.Manufacturing continues  to  improve.  Our auto plants  are  stillproducing at  very high  levels.  The  energy area remains  mixed butnatural  gas  activity  is  still  good.  Farm  income may be  hurt  a  littleby some  fall  in  cattle prices,  but grain prices  should be  good,  andtherefore  income  should be  reasonably good overall.  An executive withone  of  the  larger  rail  lines  in our  region  that goes  to  the  West  toldme  that activity has  never been  this  high.  Not  just  whole  shipmentsto  fill  backlogs but  intermodal  transportation volumes  are  at  recordhighs,  and shippers  are  increasing their prices  and  the  increases  aresticking.The banking  industry has not  been this  strong  in  our Districtin  three decades.  Our  classified asset  levels  are as  low as  they'vebeen  since  the data have been  collected.  We  had  the  lowest  number  ofbanks  losing money  since  the  '70s,  and  earnings  are above  1.3  percenton  assets.  Loan-to-asset  ratios  have  risen  from a  low of  about  48  toover  50  percent.  Loan demand, judging  from what  bankers  tell  us,  ispicking up.  There  is  this  issue  that  was mentioned earlier with someinterest rate  rises--the  FASB rule  and what  it  might  do  to  the banksand  their level  of  activity.  That  has  not been a major concern  todate.  Capital  ratios  at  our banks  are  averaging  over  8-1/2  percent.So  things  are  generally good in  the  region.As  far as  the  national  outlook, we have  differences with theGreenbook in  some  individual  areas,  but  overall  we are  fundamentallyin  line  with the  Greenbook growth projections.  We do have  a  littlehigher  inflation projected  than does  the Greenbook, partly because ofbasic natural  rate  of  unemployment  issues  and  those  sorts  of  things.Other  than  that we're  in  line  with the Greenbook.  That concludes  mycomments.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Keehn.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  In  terms  of  the  District,  the  underlying  level  ofactivity, which of  course has  been  strong,  just  continues  to  gainmomentum.  The  auto  industry,  for example,  which  directly andindirectly so  dominates  our  area, continues  to  exceed  our earlierexpectations.  Second-quarter production  schedules were  set  at  12percent  over  last  year, and  since retail  inventories  are  at  relativelylow levels,  even  if  there  is  a  fall-off  in  sales  this  ought  not  toaffect  the production  schedules.  The  third  quarter  at  this pointseems  a  long way off;  nonetheless,  the  early expectations  are  that  theproduction levels  will  be  up very substantially  over  last year.  And,5/17/94-14-of  course,  the  third quarter  is  normally a very slow quarter.  Whilethe April  auto  sales were  down a bit  from  the  first-quarter  level,some  of  that  reduction results  from the  shortage  of  the  better sellingmodels.  Production capacity  constraints  really are getting  to  be  anincreasing problem.  In  this  environment,  the  steel  business  continuesto be  excellent;  the  raw production  side  of  the  industry is  operatingessentially  flat  out.  And  it's more than  just autos.  The  appliancebusiness  is  also very  strong, as  is  the  demand  for  other housing-related steel  products.  There  is,  though, a little  capacity availablein the  finishing end  of  the  steel  business,  and the  majors will  beincreasing their purchases  of  semi-finished  steel products  fromforeign  sources to  fill  out  that  available  capacity.  An  activity thatI haven't  mentioned in years  because  it's  been  so  absolutely moribundis  the  rail  car manufacturing business.  There also  has  been a decidedpickup  in demand  as  the  fleet  has  gotten a lot  older.  While people  inthe  industry do  not expect  that  deliveries will  be  quite as high  assome  of  the published reports  that  you've  seen, nonetheless,  we  aretold that  shipments of  35,000  to  40,000  cars  annually over the nextfew years  seem reasonable.  Not  surprisingly, prices  of  rail  cars  arebeing  increased this  year,  and there  is  a more  substantial  priceincrease  scheduled  for  next year.The heavy-duty truck business has  been  even stronger  sincethe  last meeting.  The Class  8 sales  forecast has been  raised again,this  time  to  195,000  units,  and the  sales  level will  be  constrained bycapacity limitations  as  will  the  sales  of  medium-size  trucks.  GM, forexample, would like  to  add a third  shift  to  one  of  their medium  truckproduction  facilities,  but they  just can't  get  the  qualified workers.Offsetting  this somewhat,  retail  sales  so  far  in  May are  reported tobe  a little  slower  than  earlier  in  the year, but  I think this  is  acomparative  issue,  not one of  weakness in market  conditions.  Sales  ofsome  items,  such as  home  appliances,  continue  at  a very  fast pace.  Avery  large  retailer  told me the  other day that  their  sales  ofappliances,  for example,  in April  were  25  percent  over  the sales  levelof  last  year.In  the ag  sector,  so  far  the  planting has been going well.Corn  and soybean  acreage  is  expected to  be  up  this year,  and both  thecorn  and soybean plantings,  as  of  last week  at  least,  were  well  aheadof  the  normal  schedules.  It  is,  of  course,  a long,  long way toharvest.  Nonetheless, we are  off  to  a good start  with what  areregarded as  generally good moisture conditions.  Sales  of  ag  equipmentare  well  ahead of  last  year, with  sales  of  large  tractors  some  18percent higher  than  last  year;  and last  year was,  in  a comparativesense,  quite strong.All  of  this  strength certainly gives  a very positive tone  tothe District,  but  I do  think  there are  some worrisome  signs  on  thepricing front.  In  the  steel  business,  I've mentioned at  a pastmeeting or  two  that  there  is  a $10  a ton price  increase  scheduled  forIn  addition,  the majors  are adjusting discounts  and pricing  forextras,  which will  have  the  effect of  raising  steel  prices by aboutanother  2 percent.  Aluminum manufacturers  are reducing  theirproduction  to  firm up  the prices.  Admittedly the  latter are  at  lowlevels,  but  the  reduced production  levels nonetheless  have resulted inhigher prices,  and  I am  told  that  the  Russians  are  cooperating withthis  effort.  One very  large user  of  aluminum told  me the  other day5/17/94-15-that  they are forecasting  about  a 17  percent  increase  in  the pricethey will pay for  aluminum next year.  Many other manufacturers  reportan upward shift  in the  cost  of  their raw material  and componentpurchases.  By no  means  is  this  a dramatic  shift,  but  it  indicatesjust a  different attitude  and a different  tone  out  there  than  has beenthe  case  in  the past.  Some,  of course,  are  finding ways  to pass  theseincreases  through  in the  form of  higher prices  for  their products.For  example,  although  their heavy truck prices won't  be increased  thisyear,  one very large manufacturer  is  planning a pretty significantprice  increase next year.  Of  course,  retail  auto prices  are beingincreased as  we  go  along here.  Despite  all  this,  so  far  there doesnot  seem to  be any upward pressure  on  the wage front.  Thougheverybody we  talk to  says  there  is  a shortage  of  qualified  labor,  sofar  at  least  it  has  not  resulted in  higher wage rates;  but  I justwonder how long  that  can continue  to  hold.With  regard to  the national  economy, our  numbers  areessentially in  line  with those  of  the  Board staff.  I do  think  that  atthis  point  the  risks,  both  in terms  of  growth  and inflation,  are  onthe  up  side.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Part  of  the  TwelfthDistrict  continues  to  show very  strong growth.  Outside  of  California,the  growth  of  employment between March  1993  and March  1994  was  3.3percent.  And over  that period  three  states--Nevada,  Idaho,  and Utah--ranked first,  second, and third  in the  nation in  terms  of  job growth,and Arizona ranked  seventh.  In  the Pacific  Northwest,  we  see  economicgrowth  that  is  best  characterized as being pretty  solid, but at  a  lessspectacular pace than  in  the  other  states  that  I mentioned.  I mightnote  that  I had an  opportunity  to meet with  the head of  a majorconstruction company based  in Oregon;  he's been in  the  business  for  30years  and he  said  this  is  the  strongest period that  he  has ever  seen.His biggest  client  is  Intel,  and  they have a huge project  going on  inAlbuquerque,  another one  likely  to  start  soon  in Arizona,  and anotherone  in  Oregon  itself.  One  of  the  interesting things  is  that  theseprojects  are  not  all  for  the  Pentium chip.  As  a matter  of  fact,they're building plants  for  the  next generation--which  are  still  inthe  design phase.  But  in any case,  these  are  major projects.Hawaii's  economy remains weak and  the  job  losses  continue  inthat  state.  On  a mildly positive note,  though,  the visitor  countseems  to  be up  from what  it  was  a year ago.  California appears  tohave hit  the bottom of  its  long  down cycle, but  the current  pace  ofactivity  seems  to be  improving very slowly.  If  you look  at  theCalifornia employment  data--and they seem  to be  revised veryfrequently--they show  a trough  in December but  job growth  betweenbroad-based measures  such  as  state  tax  revenues,  retail  sales,  andpersonal  income  show basically no  trend.  I'd say  the  only area  inCalifornia where there  are  convincing signs  of  significant  improvementis  real  estate and other  construction.  Existing home  sales,  housingpermits,  and nonresidential  construction awards  all  improved verysignificantly  during  the  last  two  quarters compared with the  samelevels  in  early 1993.5/17/94-16-Turning to  the  national  economy, our policy assumptions  arevery similar  to  those  in  the  Greenbook, and we  come  to  similarconclusions  about what  is  likely  to  happen  in  the  economy.  However,we do  seem to  have a  somewhat  different view on the  responsiveness  ofthe  economy  to  interest rates.  In  our model,  that  responsivenessappears  to be  a little  larger.  Consequently we have a  little  weakereconomy  in the  second half  of  this  year,  and next year we have  alittle  stronger growth because we have  long-term  rates  coming down abit more  than  in  the Greenbook.  With regard  to  inflation, with  thesmall  amount  of  unused  capacity in  the  economy, we  do not  see theprospect  for  improvement in  inflation  from this point  on,  and wecertainly don't  rule  out  the possibility  that  the  inflation numberscould  begin to  look even worse  in  1995.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I've been reporting  for  several  meetings  thatthe  tone  in our  District  is  pretty positive and nothing  has  changed.I've been in  this  business  for  about  20  years  now, and  I would have tosay  that  I can't remember  a time  when  the anecdotal  information wehear  in our District was  any stronger  than  it  is  now.  There  are  veryfew weak spots--that we hear about  anyway.  I think  it's  fair  to  saythat  most people  that  we  talk  to  are broadly optimistic  aboutprospects  for  the near  term, at  least  for growth  of  jobs.  A  lot  ofnoteworthy things have happened but  I guess  the  single  most noteworthydevelopment  in our region  recently has  been the  enormous  improvementin commercial  real  estate  activity.  Activity  in  this  sector  appearsto  be increasing sharply.  I don't  think  there has been a great  dealof  actual  new construction yet, but  vacancy rates are  declining,prices are rising,  rents  are rising,  and markets  seem to be  tighteningin a number of  our communities.  Just  a  couple  of  examples:  TheRaleigh-Durham market  in North Carolina was  described at  our  lastboard meeting as  being as  tight  as  it  has  been in  about  a decade, andit  has been a pretty good market  through this  whole period.  We alsoare  hearing a number of  reports  that  things  are  improving  in  thissector  here around Washington.  We  get reports  that  the  northernVirginia,  D.C.,  and  the  Baltimore/Washington  corridor markets  aretightening,  rents are up,  prices are  rising at  least  to  some  extent,and  that  of  course was  one  of  the worst  situations  in  the  country.More broadly, we're told  that  there  is  substantial  domestic andinternational  investment  demand for  commercial  real  estate  propertiesin our region despite  the  recent  backup  in  long-term  rates.  So  thenews  on  the  real  estate  front  is  bullish  in our  area, and  that'srefreshing because  it wasn't very long  ago  that people were  talkingabout  a 15-year  real  estate depression  in this  part  of  the  country.Elsewhere, we  are  still  hearing,  as  I reported  earlier,  a  lotof  anecdotal  comments  suggesting increased  concern about  the  outlookfor prices  and  inflation.  I think it's  fair  to  say  that  theseconcerns  are  not restricted  to  bankers  and  financial people.  When  oursmall  business and agriculture  advisory committee met  a few weeksback, we polled them  on  their  inflation  expectations  and the  vastmajority  expect  some worsening  in  that  situation.  They  see theeconomy  strengthening;  they see  labor markets  tightening;  they didn'tuse  the  term  shortages  of  skilled  labor but  they said  there wereshortages  of  "good" labor.  And  they  talked  about  tightening  in  anumber  of  other markets.  So  a clear majority of  these people  areexpecting  inflation pressures  to  rise,  and  I think  that's  the  general5/17/94-17-attitude not  just  in  that  group but  across my region broadly.  Sothat's  the District  situation.As  far as  the  national  outlook  is  concerned, as  I understandit,  the  staff  is  now assuming  that  the  funds  rate  is  going  to  rise  toabout  the  4-1/2  percent  level  sometime around  fall,  and that  anincrease  of  that  magnitude will  be  sufficient  to  hold the  growth  ofreal  GDP  to  about  2-1/2  percent  at  an  annual  rate  in  the  second halfof  this  year  and through  1995  and also  keep  the core  rate  of  inflationat  about  3 percent  over  that  period.  Now, moderate GDP  growth  likethis  might not be  a great  outlook  in all  circumstances, but my  feelingis  that  it  wouldn't be a bad  outcome  right now, given where we  are  andwhat  is  happening.  After all,  it  would follow  a year  of  solid growthin which we have moved much closer  to  full  employment.  I think itwould lay a nice  foundation  for  sustained growth out  beyond theprojection period.  We  don't  talk about  this  too much at  non-Humphrey-Hawkins meetings,  but  there may even be  a  little  further progresstoward  our  longer-term price  stability goal.  But  I have  to  say thatI'm concerned about what  I see  as  the  generally accommodative policywe've  followed up  to  this  point.  I still  think that  may give us  morethrust  in  both real  GDP growth  and nominal  GDP growth, at  leastthrough the  end of  1994,  than  the  Greenbook envisions.  And I don'tthink it's  by any means  assured that  a 4-1/2  percent  funds  rate  isgoing to  get  us  the  relatively moderate inflation  and real  growth  thatthe  Greenbook is  projecting  for next  year.  In short,  it  seems  to  methat  there are  substantial upside  risks  in  these projections  on boththe  real  side  and the  inflation  side,  and we need  to  give  the upsiderisks  some  careful  weight  when we  discuss  policy later  in  the meeting.

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Conditions  in  theSixth District  are  also very, very good  and  the  expansion is  prettybroadly based and relatively balanced.  Let  me just  tick off  some  ofthe  sectors  of  the  economy.  In  the  retail  sector,  sales  did taper  offa little  in April  although  the  activity in  recent  months  has  exceededretailers' expectations  by a sizable  margin.  Many of  them areplanning to  add to  their  inventories.  Auto sales  are  still  quitestrong  in most parts  of  the  District.  The  interesting thing  to me  isthat  the  dealers  are  expecting continuing growth,  although at  asomewhat more moderate  rate,  in  this  area  through  the  rest  of  thisyear and into  next year.  Tourism, as  I've  reported before,  is  asource  of  considerable  strength  in  the  region.  There  has  been a  fall-off  in  European travelers  but  that's being  taken  up by domestictravelers  and also  by people  from  the  Caribbean and Latin America.  Iwon't  say  anything about  the  casino  gambling  again because  we  all  knowabout  that.  I'm going  to  bet that  it  will  continue!On  the production  side,  our  survey in  April  for  industrialproduction suggests  that  there has  been  some  leveling off  in  output.But  the  expectations  for  future  activity are above  those seen  at  thistime  last year.  There  was  some  effect  on production  from  theTeamsters  strike,  so  that  cut  down activity  a little,  and suppliers  tothe  automobile  sector  are  running  at  near capacity  in  the  District.Textiles, particularly  in  the household  area and apparel  fabrics,  alsoare  sources  of  strength.  The only weakness  on  the production  side  isin defense  and  aerospace.5/17/94-18-On the  real  estate  side,  sales  of  single-family homes  remainquite  strong  throughout  the  District.  Many realtors are  reportingthat  the  recent  increases  in mortgage  rates have  actually  spurredbuying on the part  of  people who  were sitting  on  the  fence,  as  itwere.  Inventories  of  homes  remain quite  tight  in many areas,  andrealtors  are reporting  increases  in prices  as  well.  Builders  arereporting strong  increases  in  the number  of homes  under construction,although  speculative  activity  is  practically nonexistent.  Trafficthrough the  subdivisions  is  quite heavy, and that's  in  contrast to  theassertion  in  a letter  that  I read this  morning  that you received, Mr.Chairman.On the multifamily side,  markets  continue to  improve,  too.Building permits  were up  50  percent  over  a year  ago  in  the  firstquarter.  Nonresidential  real  estate  is  also  doing better.  Commercialreal  estate  agents  are more positive  now about  future  activity thanthey have been in  a  long time.  On  the  financial  side  in  the  states,budgetary pressures  that  were  in existence  a while ago havepractically disappeared due to  the  new growth.On the price  side,  in  contrast  to  some  of  the comments  I'veheard  today, we're  finding  that price pressures  are practicallynonexistent, with the  exception of  construction  and perhaps  a littlebit  now in  textiles.  Lumber prices have  stabilized  in  the  last  fewmonths, but  the  costs  of  other building materials  have  increased andwe are  also  seeing  some wage pressures  for  skilled labor  in  theconstruction  industry.  Wage pressures are basically  fairly quiet  inother  sectors.  Retailers are  telling us  that  intense  competition iskeeping a  lid on prices.In  the banking  sector,  I would echo what  Tom Hoenig  said,  inthat banking  in  our District  is  quite  strong;  loan demand  is  up,particularly  in the  consumer  sector.  So,  Mr. Chairman, I think  thatis  probably as positive a report  as  I've been able  to  make  in quite  along  time.  It's  hard  to  find any weaknesses  in  our  area.With respect  to  the  national  economy, I must  say that  I'vebeen impressed by the  strength  of  the data we've  gotten  since we lastmet,  notwithstanding the  lower-than-expected  first  quarter.  I had atthe  last  meeting tended  to  downplay the  rather bullish  expectationsfor  growth in  our forecast,  but  I've become  a  little more  convincedthat  the  upsurge  in  the  fourth  quarter may continue to  play out  for  alittle while  longer.  So,  our  forecast  for GDP  is  somewhat  strongerfor  1994,  fourth quarter  over  fourth quarter,  although  we do  show auntil  1995.  I won't  go  into  the  various  differences  in the  forecastand  I wouldn't  want  to  make  too  much of  the  differences  because  whileour  forecast  does  differ  from the  Greenbook  in the near  term,  theforecasts  converge  in  1995.  What  I think comes  out of  both of  thoseforecasts as  far  as  I'm concerned is  that  some  additional  move  inpolicy as  contemplated in the  Greenbook probably  is  needed and  in  timewill  cause  inflation to  moderate.  Thank you.

MS.  MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Things are  clearly  inrecovery mode  in New England.  Payroll  employment has  grown  for  theregion as  a whole  in  each of  the  last  three months  and  jobs  overall5/17/94-19-are  about  2 percent  above a year ago.  This  improvement  is  broad-based.  With  the  sole  exception  of  durable  goods manufacturing, allmajor industry  categories had more  jobs  than a year  ago.  On ageographic  basis, only Connecticut  continues  to show job  losses.  TheNew England unemployment rate  declined  for  the  third straight month to5.6  percent,  well  below the  rate  for  the  nation as  a whole.  Otherindicators  are also  positive;  average weekly hours  in manufacturingreached a new post-recession high,  help wanted advertising  rose  innational pace  slightly.  All  this  good news  should not  obscure  thefact  that  the  region as  a whole  has gained back  only about a quarterto  a  third of  the  ground lost  during  the  recession, no matter whatdata are used to measure progress,  although one  could  question whetherwe want  to  go back  to  the  late  1980s  in  terms  of  how heated up  thingswere  in New England.  Companies  continue  to  report  that  competition isvery keen  and that  their  own quality and  efficiency improvements arethe primary  determinants of  survival,  not  rising  overall  demand.There's no  rising  tide  to  carry them all  to  prosperity.  On  the  otherhand,  there doesn't  seem to be  any remaining undertow  either.Several  contacts,  including  some  on our  board, complainedthat  the  Fed  is  raising  interest rates  just  as  the  economy  finallyshows  some  signs  of  life.  In  response to  our questions,  however,  anumber indicated  that  they were  seeing  attempts by suppliers  toincrease  prices, but  these  attempts were being resisted.  Retailerssaw strong  growth  in March but  a  fall-off more  recently.  Cautiousoptimism may be  the  best way to  express  the New England viewpointalmost  across  the board.On  the national  scene, we  too  believe that  growth will  besomewhat  stronger  than  projected by the  Greenbook.  We've  beenimpressed by the  degree  of  tightening  in labor  markets recently, buton  the  other hand our projections  of  the NAIRU are  at  the  low end ofthe  range  that  seems  to be  used by Board staff,  and we  are  a  littlemore  optimistic  about potential  GDP growth.  While  our sense  of  thecomponents  of  the picture varies  from those  in  the Greenbook, we  doagree with projections  of  low inflation, at  least  in  the  near  term.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  President McTeer.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The economy  in the  Eleventh District  continuesto  grow moderately,  about  in line  with  the national growth  rate,possibly a little weaker.  Our  expansion is  broadly based, with theexception of  energy and defense-related  sectors.  Construction inparticular is  very strong;  it  moves  from strong  to booming  in  someareas  that  are benefiting  from  relocations from  other parts  of  thecountry.  Median prices  of  existing houses  are up  6 to  10  percentdepending  on what  market  one  is  talking  about.  Construction is  goingon  all  around me, and my house  is  the  only one  that  I know of  that  hasnot gone  up  in  estimated value.  I just  got  that  in  the mail.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Maybe  it's  because of  the  residents!

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  It's  a big mystery.  The  gains  in  nonresidentialconstruction  are  also  significant,  matching  those  in housing.  Retail,warehouse, and industrial  buildings  are  strong throughout  theDistrict.  Even commercial property  is  beginning to  rise  in price,although there  is  still  a lot  of  excess  commercial  property  in  the5/17/94-20-major metropolitan areas,  including an  old  Reserve Bank building  inDallas  that  is  still  on  the market.As  I've indicated, we  are benefiting a  good bit  fromrelocations.  We are benefiting from being  in what we refer  to  as  thelow-wage,  low-cost  center  of  the North American  free  trade  area now.We've been asking our  directors  and Beigebook contacts  questions  aboutpressures  on prices  and wages  for  some  time.  We  are getting someindications  that price  pressures  are beginning  to  appear,  and  somewage pressures  have  been mentioned.  This  is  the  first  time  since  1985that  people  in our  area are mentioning upward pressure  on wages.I don't  really have  anything  of value  to  add about  thenational economy except  that  it  seems  a lot  stronger than  the  first-quarter GDP  numbers would  indicate,  especially the  real  final  salesnumber.  Then the  April  retail  sales number  brings  to  mind a RichardPryor  comment,  "Who are you going  to believe,  me or  your own  lyingeyes?"  There seems  to be  a conflict between  those numbers  and thefeel  of  the  economy  out  there.When  I talk  to  people about policy, there  seems  to be adifference  of  opinion  on whether we're ahead of  the  curve,  too  farahead  of  the  curve,  or behind  the  curve.  There's more  uniformity ofopinion,  though, that  we need to  do  what we're going  to  do  quickly andget  it  behind us.  I often hear  that we're  creating uncertainty withsmall  steps,  and they  urge us  to  do what  we need to  do.  As a matterof  fact,  last  week we  had a vote  in our board meeting on  a  discountrate  recommendation. dissented from  the vote, buteven he  said whatever you  do  don't do  it  piecemeal.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  The District continues  clearly to  be a part  ofthe Northeast--its growth trend  is  positive  but  somewhat  slower  thanthe nation.  Manufacturing continues  to grow, but  the pace of  growthhas  flattened out  some.  The bookings  for  the  future  also have  gone uprather substantially but  that  too  seems  to  be  flattening out.  Isuspect  it  may have  to  do  with some  capacity  constraints.  A majorrailroader  in our District  reports what  others have  said  in  therailroad business:  they're  operating  flat  out.  They can't  get carsfast  enough  to ship  the  goods.  Residential  construction has made  agood-sized  rebound, although I  think some  of  that  is  clearly seasonal.Once  that  part  is  out,  I think we will have moderate  growth.Nonresidential construction  is  mixed.  Some  areas  are  still  dead  andlikely  to  be  that way  for  some  time.  Other  areas  are  beginning toshow some  signs  that  there will  be additional  construction, probablymore so  next  year than  this  year.  Retail  sales  clearly have  pickedup.  The  automobile business  is  strong, and  it's  clearly a  seller'shave  not  seen a whole  lot  of  growth  in  commercial  lending,  are nowreporting modestly rising  demand.  Business  loans,  both to  financeinventory accumulation as  well  as  capital  equipment,  and  consumer andreal estate  lending  continue  to  pick up.  In  our labor markets  therate  of  unemployment  for  the  District as  a whole  is  about  the  same  asfor  the nation,  although it  varies  quite  widely around a relativelysmall District.  However,  the  growth  in  new jobs  has been  on  thesluggish  side despite  the  improvement  in  the  economy.  Consequently,wage pressures  are  well  contained.  On  the price  side,  there clearly5/17/94-21-is  a desire and a wish to  raise  some prices, but  I'm  still  hearingmostly that  it's  very difficult  to  make  those increases  stick.As  far  as  the  national  economy goes,  I don't have  a lot  toadd.  I think at  this point  in  an  expansion  the  risks tend  to  be  forfaster  growth rather than  slower growth.  Perhaps  it's  just my ownDistrict  and  the  influence  that  that has,  but my sense  is  that  theodds pretty  strongly favor  moderate growth and that  there  is  not  a lotmore upside risk  to  the  economy  than downside risk.On monetary policy, because  the  District  is  improving but  notas  fast  as  the  nation, the  increasing  interest rates  and our actionshave  been more  justifiable on  a national  basis  than a District  basis.I am running  into what has  just been  echoed across  the  table:  Do whatyou  have  to  do  and get  it  out  of  the way so  that  we  can get  thisuncertainty behind us.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The District  economycontinues  to  be very healthy.  The only  exception  to  that  is  theenergy sector,  which of  course  is  not very large  in  the District;otherwise,  things  continue  to  do  very well.  I think people  arebecoming increasingly optimistic, and  that's  starting  from, at  thispoint, a fairly  optimistic base.  A few anecdotes,  some of  which  I'vereported before,  which I think are  interesting and  relevant:  I'veheard a number of  reports over  the  last  several months  about  leaninventories, with  the  clear  implication that people expect  someattempt  to  step up  production and build inventories over  the nextseveral months.  I would expect  that  to  occur.  Continued  reportsabout  labor shortages, particularly of  skilled labor  in  many markets,do  not seem  to  have  translated into  a broad-based increase  in  wagepressures,  although in  the  Twin Cities market  it  does appear  that wageincreases--this  is  from  the panel  that  we work with  in  trying  to planour  own compensation--turned out  to be  larger  in  1993  than those  thathad been planned.  Exactly what was  going on  there  I don't know,although we  face a pretty  tight  labor market.On  the banking  side,  there are  reports of  increases  in loandemand and some preliminary indications  that  banks are  starting to  bida little more  aggressively for  funds  through small  time deposits--something we haven't  seen  for quite  some  time.  As  far as  pricing  andprice pressures  go,  it's  very hard to  find any broad-based indicationsof  acceleration  of  inflation, but  what  I am hearing  is  that  discountsare  diminishing and the  frequency of  sales  is  diminishing.  It's veryhard to  quantify, but  that  does seem  to  be  occurring.With  regard to  the  national  economy,  I must  say  the  logic  ofthe  Greenbook  forecast  does appeal  to me.  It  seems  to  me  that  theincrease  in  interest rates,  particularly in long rates,  may work asthat  forecast envisions,  that  is,  growth in real  GDP will  slow onceagain--whether  it  occurs  in  the  third quarter or  somewhat  laterremains  to be  seen.  That may succeed in  stabilizing the  rate ofinflation about where  it  has  been.  Although I must  observe  that  inthe  last couple  of  expansions--coming out  of  the  1980-82  recession andthe  1973-75 recession--once  the  economy built up momentum,  thoseexpansions  seemed  to go  on  longer and  to  be  stronger  than we,certainly, had  anticipated.  Now, some  of  that may be  the  fact  that,5/17/94-22-of course,  the  momentum is  not  independent  of  the  policies we pursued;and maybe we  just  reacted too  late.  But  at  least  a naive reading  ofthose  expansions  suggests  to  me that  once  the  economy starts  todevelop some momentum, that  tends  to  go  on  for  a while.Some numbers  that  I was  looking at  raise  questions  in my mindabout what  we might be  able  to  say about  the  inflation  outlook.  Thesenumbers  suggest,  though  I guess  it's a little  too  early to  even callthis  analysis,  that  the relationship between  labor market  conditionsand  the performance  of wages  or  compensation seems  to havedeteriorated in  the  early 1980s--around  1983  and 1984--and hasn't  beenreestablished.  This  suggests  that we  can't  conclude very much fromlabor market conditions  and what that might  imply  for wage  pressures.Similarly, there seems  to be deterioration  in  the  relationship betweenutilization rates  and consumer prices  that occurred about  the  sametime.  I don't  take much comfort from  that;  it  raises uncertainty inmy mind, if  nothing else,  about  the price  outlook, and it  forces me  torely a little more  on my  intuition.  My instincts  at  this point  arethat  the  risks  of  inflation  certainly are  on  the up side,  particularlybecause we're  not  indifferent  to  errors  in  that direction.  In otherwords, we're not  terribly concerned  if  we undershoot  inflation.  Wemight be  a lot more  concerned  if we  overshoot.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our  District isperforming  in a fashion much more  similar  to  the  Seventh  District thanthe Third District.  It's  a pattern of  fairly uniform strengths  thatare getting stronger.  The  ag  sector  is  looking  forward  to a thirdvery good year  overall.  It's  early  to  tell whether  they will  meetthat  expectation, but  they've had two  good years and  there certainlyis  a lot  of  optimism in the  ag  sector  and the ag  banks.  In processedfoods  especially, capacity is  up a lot.  One county  on  the westernside  of  Ohio reports  an  increase of  7 million  "layers"  in  the  pastyear--turkey processing plants.  That means  a lot  of  new capacity.Motor vehicle plants are  going  flat out,  and a lot  of  themare running  above what would be  sustainable  long-run  capacity.  But  alot  of  new capital  spending  is  occurring,  a very significant  amount bythe major manufacturers.  That  is  adding  a lot  of  optimism to people'sassessment of  the  current  situation.  Capital  goods  overall  arebooming;  and the  return of  the machine  tool  industry, notably thehigher value,  high-tech end, is  especially encouraging  to  people  insuch major communities  as  Lexington, Cincinnati,  and  Pittsburgh;  allare reporting that  the  high-tech  firms  are doing quite well.  The  onesector that  I would note where  there  is  consistent  weakness and talkabout  layoffs  or  cutting back  is  health care.  We have  some  very largehealth care  operations  in  the District,  and they  continue  to bepessimistic.I might note a couple  of  anecdotal  things  that need to bepaid attention  to  going  forward.  One  is  the  continued strike atAllegheny Ludlum Steel;  they've been  on  strike  since before Easter.This  is  a governance  kind of  issue:  Management  is  saying that  theyare going  to  see  this through  and tends  to  talk  in  terms  of  monthsrather  than days  or weeks  before  it  is  settled.  It's  importantnationally because  they provide the  stainless  components  for  theexhaust  systems  for  General Motors.  There is  no  alternative5/17/94-23-domestically at  this  time.  General Motors  has  indicated  that  they  arenow preparing  to  go  to  Japanese  stainless  steel by month  end if  theycan get  it.  The other alternative  would be  to  go  to  carbon  steelcomponents  and promise  buyers  that  they will  subsequently recall  thevehicles  and put  in  the  stainless  components.  GM says  that  they  arenot  going  to  shut  down production based on  this  labor stoppage.  Theother  thing that  stainless  steel  is  critical  for  is  transformers  andelectric power  operations.  There are  no  alternative  sources.  So,Allegheny Ludlum has--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There used  to  be  a big  stainless  highalloy  industry in  this  country, but  it  has  evaporated.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Yes,  and  it's  a  tough one  for  us,  and  it'sadding  a degree  of  pessimism to  the  Pittsburgh  area  especially.  Theother more or  less  anecdotal  report  relates  to  residential  housing.What we  are hearing  in  the  District  is  that  the problem  is  not  thecost  or  availability of  funds  but  the  cost  and availability ofbuilding materials.  The  Ohio Trade  Council  Union has become  adeveloper  of  medium- and low-income  housing andcomplains  about escalating  costs  of productionand  that  is  what  he  sees  as  the  source  of  inflation,  not  the  cost  offunds.Turning  to  the  national  economy, my reading  is  certainlyinfluenced by conditions  in  the District.  It's not  a question  ofencountering any kind  of  head winds;  rather,  it's  the  buildup of  tailwinds  that  I think  is  of  increasing concern.  I no  longer  feel  thatit's  a case  of  simply backing  further off  the accelerator  but  that wedon't  know where neutral  is,  but  I think  that  we  are well  shy of  aneutral  policy and getting  there may not be  enough.  The Greenbookprojections  depend critically in my assessment  on  the deceleration ofnominal  GDP  growth.  It's  the  nominal  spending where  I have myconcerns  rather  than the  decomposition  of  that  into  its  real  and pricecomponents.  In  1992  we had  growth of  over  6-1/2  percent  for  the  fullfour-quarter period and that was  more  than had been expected.  Therewas  some  deceleration  in  1993,  even with  the robust  fourth quarter,thanks  to  the weakness  in  the  first  half  of  the year,  but growth  forthe  year  still  was  5-1/2  percent.  Growth this  year  is  looking  likeanother  5 to  5-1/2  percent.  But  for  the  forecast  to  work,  it  isimportant  for  nominal  GDP  to  decelerate  to  under 4-1/2  percent  in  thenext  18  months.  I don't  see what  will make  that happen.  I have noconfidence that  the kind  of  policy assumptions  in  the  Greenbook or  thelinkage  of  working  through long-term bond yields  are  going to producethat  deceleration of  nominal GDP.  The way  I now  tend to  think aboutwhere  we are  is  not  that we  are  entering  the  fourth year  of  theexpansion, but rather  that we  are  someplace  in  the  first  year  of  aclassic  expansion.  As  it  looks  to  me,  the period  of  about  2 or 2-1/2years  after  the  end of  the  Gulf War was  one  of  economic  restructuringin  a lot  of  sectors  and a lot  of  regions.  The  talk about  it  being  ananemic  recovery was  because  it  wasn't  a recovery, in  a sense,  butrather  a period of  restructuring.  Some  time  during  the course  of  lastyear  we  entered  into what would be  more of  a classical  recovery fromrecession.  If  that  interpretation is  right,  then we  should bethinking  in  terms  of  a year  to  six quarters of  5 to  6 percent  real GDPgrowth.  Yet,  most  of  us  are  saying  that we  don't  see  that  the  economyhas  the capacity to  handle that  many quarters with  5 or  6 percent  real5/17/94-24-GDP  growth without  way overshooting.  If  that's  an  accurate  assessmentof where we  are,  then monetary policy  is well  behind the  curve.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  The  national economy continues  toexpand rapidly and  its momentum appears,  at  least  to me,  to bebuilding.  Industrial  production, for  example,  grew at  a  5.4  percentannual  rate  for  the  four months  ending  in April,  faster  than  the  4.6percent rise  in  1993.  Payroll  employment rose  at  a 2.7  percent  ratein the  four months  ending in April,  following  a  1.9  percent rate  ofincrease  in  1993.  The unemployment  rate fell  about  a  full  percentagepoint  over  the past  year when  comparable methods  are used  to  measureit.  Despite  efforts  by businesses  to  build inventory  in  the  firstquarter  of  this  year,  the  inventory-to-sales ratio  fell  sharply assales  boomed.In  the  Eighth District,  economic activity  has also  expandedrapidly in recent months.  Many firms  report expansions,  additions  topayrolls,  and increases  in  sales.  The  District continues  to  growfaster  than  the nation  as  a whole,  as  best we can determine.  Forexample,  during the past  quarter nonagricultural  employment  increasedin all  District  states by  a significantly larger percentage  than  thenational  average, namely by 7-1/2  percent  at an  annual  rate  versus  2.1percent  nationally.  Increases  in  employment  are  occurring in  nearlyevery major manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sector.  Districtreports  reveal  that  the  Eighth  District's  expansion  is  spreading toparts  of  the  District  such as  southern  Illinois  that  had untilrecently been  sluggish.  Particularly noteworthy developments areoccurring  in  the  transportation sector.  Increases  in  auto production,which Tom Hoenig  and Si  Keehn  have mentioned, are  expected  to  boostauto  employment  in  St.  Louis  to  the  highest  level  since 1989.Commercial  aircraft  orders also  are  rising considerably.  TheDistrict's  real  estate  sector  remains  strong  as  evidenced by double-digit  increases  in building permits  and  continuing anecdotal  reportsthat  homes  available  for  sale are  in  short  supply.  Relatively  strongloan  demand, especially by businesses,  is  also  indicative  of  thestrength of  the  Eighth District's  economy.The momentum of  the  economic expansion,  as  I mentionedbefore,  seems  to  me  to  be building.  I am not  comfortable  with theGreenbook outlook  that nominal  and  real  GDP are  poised to  slow down  inthe  second half  of  this  year.  Such  a  slowing  appears  to  be  based on  acutback  in  interest-sensitive  sectors,  especially housing.  Housingaffordability, even with today's  mortgage  rates,  in my view  is  veryfavorable.  And reports at  last week's  Business  Roundtable meetingexpressed strong  doubts  that  interest  rate  increases  are retardingspending  to  any  degree  at  all  or  are  likely to  do  so  in  the nearfuture.The continuing  strong performance of  the District  andnational  economies  reinforces my concerns  about  the  inflation outlook.In  the  Eighth District  the prospects  for  increased cost  and pricepressures  have been boosted by low-levels  of  farm  inventories  and newhouses  for  sale,  and more broadly by  substantial  job growth  andrelatively  low unemployment  rates.  Nationally, both  consumer  andproducer price increases  have  accelerated over  the past  seven monthsfrom their pace  over  the previous  five  months.  In  addition,5/17/94-25-inflationary expectations have  increased  as  well, which  is  reflectedin declines  in both bond prices  and  the  foreign exchange value  of  thedollar  since  our  last  meeting.

GOVERNOR KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I'm essentiallythe  same place  I was  in March,  so  I'll  try  to be  a little  brief  today.We have moved policy considerably,  three  times  now, which I think hasbeen  entirely appropriate.  The  reason that  I  feel particularlycomfortable with  that  comes  largely  from the  fact  that  I thinkinterest rates were  too  accommodative  for  present  conditions  andneeded to  be  changed.  And probably we haven't  completely eliminatedthat  yet and we  do have  a  little more to  go.  Consequently,  I wouldexpect  to  support  a policy move  action  in  the  second half  of  thismeeting.My comfort doesn't  primarily arise  from an  especially highlevel  of  concern  that  we  are near  full  capacity  and on  the  cusp  ofsome  type  of  an  inflationary flashpoint.  I certainly do  recognizethat  there's  considerable strength  out  there  and we  get  confirmationof  that  from the  consistent  reports--and I'm sure  they're  correct--from around the  Districts  that  there  is  a good deal  of  momentum.Consequently,  there  surely  is  the possibility that  the economy couldoverheat.  But  I think  there's  reason  for at  least a bit  of  skepticismthat  that  is  going to  happen.  A brief  recitation,  if  I may;  I didthis  the  last  time we  were here  and most  of  these  things  have beenreferred to  in one  form or other already this  morning.  I won't  talkfurther about  interest rates;  we know how much they've  gone  up.  Theirrestrictive  impact  is  just  beginning to  be  felt.  Mike Prell  madereference to  housing  in particular.  Second, one  factor  that  I thinkis  important  that  we haven't  talked  about much  is  the  impact of  unitlabor  costs.  We've  done very well  in  that  regard recently.  In fact,it  has  been getting meaningfully lower  now  for  some  four  straightyears.  Staff  tells me  that  in  the  case  of  the  unit  labor  cost  index,which  has been  decreasing  substantially and consistently, that  thatimpacts  the  economy with a six-quarter  lag.  This  means  that  we've  gota  lot  more  favorable  impact  to  come  from the  restraint  that  is  alreadyin place.On  the productivity side,  we've  recently been  looking  at  a 2percent  increase.  Staff has  raised  its  estimate of  trend to  1-1/2percent, but  if  I understand correctly, they are  only expecting  1percent  over  the  remaining part  of  the  forecast  period.  All  theprivate  sector  conversations  I've  had suggest  that  we  might continueto  do quite  well  in  that  regard  rather  than fall  back.  If  that  turnsout  to be  the  case,  it  does  two  things  for  us,  obviously.  First  ofall,  it  holds  down  cost pressures;  and  secondly,  it  extends  the  amountof  capacity  that  the  economy has  available before  it  gets  itself  intodifficulty.In  the area  of  consumer  spending, we've  talked before  aboutthe very high  level  of  debt  that  was built  up  through  the  1980s;  thatplateaued  for a while but  did not  come down,  and now it  has  begun  torise again.  This  leaves  me with a considerable  question  in  my mind asto  how long  the  legs under consumer  expenditures may be.  Indeed,  ifthey're very long,  I would worry about  that  a  lot  because we're  in  anew territory now in  terms  of  consumer debt.  Not  unrelated to  that  is5/17/94-26-the  fact  that  autos have been a part of  the push  so  far  and thatprobably has  approximately peaked.  We've  talked about  foreigneconomies;  I won't  go  into  that  any more but  their weakness  impacts  onus  here.  And then, of  course,  fiscal  policy  continues  to be  mildlycontractionary,  at  least  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast period.All  in  all,  I have  considerable  confidence  that  there's  a  lotof  underlying  strength in  the  economy, a  lot  of  good solid momentum,and  that  things  look very favorable.  I believe  that  the  economy cankeep growing  despite whatever  constraints  are  out  there and  that  ourrecent policy actions  as  well  as  those restraints  give us  goodprospects  for keeping  inflation well  in check.  Thank you.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  TheSecond District's  economy appears  to  be advancing at  a  rather nicepace  this  spring.  Preliminary March reports  indicate  thatestablishment  job growth was  strong  in most  sectors  of  the  economy.Tax  receipts  suggest  that personal  income grew  at a  reasonable pace.Retail  sales  surpassed  the  optimistic  expectations of  the  merchants,with actually some problems  in April  because  inventory  levels  arelower  than the  merchants would like  them to be.  The commercial  realestate market  is  showing considerable  signs  of  revival  except  in thelower part  of  Manhattan Island.  The anecdotal  information  for Apriland the  first part  of  May suggest  that  this  growth  is  continuing.  Andconsumer price  inflation  is  quite  subdued in  the  District.  There issomething  of  a malaise around  the  financial  services  industry becauseof  the  difficult markets  in  the  first  four months  of  the year andbecause  of  some  concerns  about  individual  firms  and problems  relatedto  them--for example,  the  case  of  Kidder  Peabody and  the  death ofLazard and then  the  New York Times  article  on  Sunday regarding whatwould appear  to  be some  questionable  relationships among  firms  in  themunicipal  finance  area.On the  national  level,  we differ  somewhat  from  the Greenbookin  having  a little  slower  growth  in  the  second quarter and a  littlehigher growth  in  the  second half  of  the  year, but  the  net  result  isthat we  are just  0.1  percent  above  for  the Q4  to  Q4  period.  We  alsohave a slowdown  in  1995  to  2.4  percent growth  in  GDP, which is  justabout where  the  Greenbook is.  However, we're not  quite  as  optimisticabout  the  CPI.  We've  got  it  up 3.1  percent whereas  the Greenbook hasit  up  2.8 percent.  I would not be  very satisfied with an  upturn  ininflation  as  something  that  we would anticipate.  So  that  raises  thequestion of  what  really  is  going  on  in  the  economy and what  ifanything  the  Federal Reserve  can do  about  it.  We think  that  growthhas  to  be slowed  down because we  think  that,  certainly by  the  end ofthe  year, potential  GDP will be fully used up.  We will be  at  or veryclose  to  the NAIRU  and at  the  use of  manufacturing capacity  that hashistorically given  rise  to  cost  and  therefore price  pressures.  One  ofthe  things  that  those who  don't want  to  find inflation, especiallyamong  journalists,  are looking  to  is  the possibility  that  the  capacityavailability outside  the  United States  will  help us  avoid inflation.We  looked at  that  quite  carefully  and  find very little  solace  there.In  the  area of  interest  rates,  one of  the  things  that's  mostdifficult  to  forecast--and it  has been discussed by Mike  Prell both inthe  Greenbook  and  in his  oral  presentation and  then  by various members5/17/94-27-of  the  Committee  this  morning--is  to  try to  figure  out  just  how muchthe policy that  we have put  in  place  so  far  and its  effect  on medium-and  longer-term interest  rates  will  slow  the  economy down.  In  thevery sensitive areas  of,  say,  the  7-  to  10-year maturities,  it'sdifficult  to  figure out  exactly what has  caused that  increase  ininterest  rates, but we've  done  a rather  large  amount  of work on  therelationship between the  Treasury market and  therefore  interest ratesin  general  and mortgage-backed securities;  Joan Lovett  referred  tothat  rather briefly  in her  presentation.  But  quite clearly, asinterest  rates  go up and  the  duration of  any mortgage  portfolioincreases,  the  hedging requirement  moves  out  the  yield curve.  And wethink  that  has a  fair  amount  to  do with  the considerable  increases  ininterest  rates  in  the  7-  to  10-year  area, especially  in  the  10-yearnote itself.  If  that  is  so,  it means  that  we've got  a closer  linkagethan we have  had historically between  short-term  interest rates  thatthe  Fed directly can  control  and  the medium- and  longer-term ratesthat  have  a rather direct  effect  on  the  interest-sensitive sectors.  Ithink  all  of  us  would have to  agree that  we are not  quite sure  exactlyhow that  will play out  in  the  future.Another area  that  we  find has  to be  looked  at very closely  isthe  attitudes  and therefore  the  likely  spending habits  of  theconsumer.  The consumer  is  a good deal  more confident  than he  or  shewas  a couple of  months  ago.  But it's  very difficult  to  find outexactly what  they are  so  confident about  except  that  the  increase  inemployment  would seem  to  have  lowered  the  anxiety level  about  losingjobs.  Still,  one hears  enough  about  layoffs  especially in  the whitecollar  sector  to  wonder how consumer  confidence  that  is  a  large partof  all  of  our  economic  forecasts, and which Governor Kelley discussedvery well  I thought,  is  going  to  affect  the  future.  So we're  in  asituation  I think where we  have policy  actions  that  need to  be  taken,but  it  seems  to  me  that  at  this particular  time  the  question marks  arerather  larger  than usual--although as  Mike  Prell pointed out,  alleconomic  forecasts  have question marks--and therefore  make decisionson policy that much more difficult.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  I've  grown considerably less  comfortable  sincethe  last  meeting with  the consensus  view that  we  have  a solid economicexpansion under way.  Not only was  the  announced GDP growth rate  inthe  first  quarter way below staff  expectations, but  staff now expectsa  further  downward revision of  the  2.6  percent  number  that wasannounced.  That,  combined with recent  statistics on  auto  sales  andproduction,  industrial  production,  retail  sales,  and a modest  reversalof  consumer  expectations,  has convinced me  that  the psychological  toneof  the economy  is  very fragile.  I attribute  that  fragility  to  jobsecurity anxiety,  fueled by continued corporate  re-engineering withthe  accompanying  layoffs  combined with worries  about  household cashflow, debt  levels,  and impending  changes  in the  health care  system andits  costs.  Nonetheless,  the  reduction  in  slack in  the economycertainly feeds  my concern  that  there remains  some prospect  for  growthwell  in excess  of potential,  and I expect  that  further absorption ofslack will  come  from  the export  sector.  As  U.S.  products  become morecompetitive because  of  dollar  rates,  technical  improvements,  higherquality, and the  recovery of  European and  Canadian  economies  as  wellas  a higher  level  of  growth  in Mexico,  the  growth  in  exports  will5/17/94-28-exceed staff  expectations  and stimulate  a higher growth  rate  than inthe Greenbook  forecast.All  in  all,  I believe  that  events  already in  train will  tendto  heal  the  fragile psychology  of  the  economy, all  of which suggeststhat  additional restraint  may be  in  order.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you.  It  appears that  the  strength ofthe  expansion  is  deeper and wider  than we have  seen previously, basedon  some  of  the  comments made  here  today.  This  is  partially due  Isuspect  to  job creation and acceptance by employees  of moves  todifferent  jobs--thus  more churning in  the  labor market.  Confidencecontinues  to  be  reasonably strong both on the  business side  and  on  theconsumer  side  even  in  the  face of  a slowdown  in  the  first-quarter GDP.Credit demand has  increased  and the  U.S.  economy appears  to beadapting better  to  changes than  our  competitors--such  changes astechnology,  labor  conditions, balance  sheet  adjustments,  and so  on.  Ifind myself with an  analysis  very similar  to Mike  Kelley's and JohnLaWare's  in that  I see  this  strength as  sustainable  and don't see  arunaway growth outlook.  We  still  have  an environment  of  re-engineering and  emphasis  on  cost  savings  and productivity.  Thisquestion of  job quality I think  is  continuing  to  put pressure onincome  levels generally.  We're also not  through  the  downsizing of  thedefense  industry.  The deficit  is  going to  continue  to  limit  fiscalpolicy initiatives.  The  low  saving rate  that we have  seen I think isgoing to  limit  long-term investment  opportunities.  The  capital  marketvolatility and stock and bond price declines  do  increase  the cost  ofcapital.  The volatility itself  raises  the  cost  of  capital,  and  thewealth  effects  that are  felt  by individuals  may start  to be  seen  inreduced consumption  and investment.On the  inflation  front,  as we've heard in  some  discussionaround  the  table,  the  recent  history  is  quite good.  I do  think thatthere are vulnerabilities,  for  example  in commodity prices  includingoil.  And although farmers  are  optimistic at  planting  time,  that'swhen  they're  the most  optimistic.  That  seems  to  be  a universal  truthin  the  ag community.  But  we do  have  low carryovers,  so  this  is  afragile  time going  into  this planting season.One  thing that hasn't been mentioned as  much was  the  fasterincreases  in  the producer price  index  in the  first quarter  of  thisyear.  Although  the April  report was better,  the  index  is  still upabout  9 percent  on an  annual basis  for  1994.  We  still have  healthcosts  as  an  uncertainty, and the  strength of  the  economy generally Ithink  is  increasing the  chances  that  inflation could start  to  heat  up.I think both the  appearance and the  actuality of  the  strongereconomy coupled with  the  realization  that there  are  checks  on thisgrowth  are  feeding  some  of  the uncertainty that  is  reflected  in  thewide  range  of  forecasts  for  GDP, inflation,  capacity constraints,  andinterest  rates.  We see  a little more  diversity of  opinion  than weordinarily do  on  the  forecast  front,  and this  is  feeding into  thecapital  markets.  They remain volatile and fragile.  I think we'restill  facing a continuation of  the  sorting out  process  that was  begunin February.  At  that  time  many people were  on  the  same  side  of  the5/17/94-29-term  interest  rates  expected to  come down, and  inflation expected tobe  under control.  So  when  the  jolts  hit  the market we  saw more  of  aneffect  than might  have been anticipated.  Those  jolts,  of  course, wereprecipitated by the  initial  Fed tightening but  also were  supported byreports  of  stronger growth more generally.  People were having  tofully assess whether  or not  real  rates  should be higher.  Then,  ofcourse, we have  domestic political  uncertainties, Japanese  tradepressures, China, Korea, one  can go  on.Traders  also have  very short  time horizons  and  they tend  tothink  in  terms  of  up or down,  and neutral was  really throwing  them acurve.  That,  I think,  enhanced the  uncertainty in  the markets.  Thisportfolio unwinding  that we've been going through  is not  aninstantaneous process  because  the portfolios  are  complex.  We  also  arefaced with  internal  firm risk management  constraints.  The markets  areefficient but  they're not  complete.  As  Bill  McDonough mentioned,there has  to  be a searching for  hedge opportunities  as  people  seek  tounwind.  We have  seen  some market liquidity  constraints as  nearsubstitutes have  been sought and  traders  are  trying to  reduceexposures.In  sum,  I don't  think  the  turmoil  is  over.  And in terms  ofthe  risks generally, while  some people  seem  to  think  that  they  aremore on  the up  side,  I see  some  countervailing forces  to  those  upsiderisks  that  are  feeding  the  fragility and  the uncertainty.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Mr. Chairman, what  struck me most  at  the  tabletoday was  the  talk of  inflation.  I've heard more  on  that  than  I'veheard in  all  the meetings  I've  attended in 2-1/2  years.  That was  asurprise  to  me.  I don't  think that  the  concern we  have  in  theanalysis  is  really on  the demand side.  I think the  staff  is  right  ontarget.  We have moderately expanding demand.  We  have what wouldotherwise be  robust demand being checked this  year by  fiscal policycontraction, by a rising yield curve,  and by a deterioratinginternational  situation.  That's moderate.  What  we  don't know,really,  is what  is  happening on  the  aggregate supply side.  GovernorKelley mentioned a very, very positive  scenario,  one  in whichproductivity is  improving  as  a result  of  substitution of  capital  forlabor  over  the past  few years.  If  he's  right,  then we  have  room for  avery extended expansion.  And, Mike,  you have  a surprising ally  in  myformer  colleague,  Jim Medoff--I don't  think we've ever  agreed in thepast--who  sent me  from the Center of  National  Policy an analysis  ofthe normalized help wanted index  against  the  unemployment  rate.  Heconcludes  that  the  NAIRU is  more  like  5-1/2  percent because  of  thechanges  you've mentioned.  I think  that  assumes  that  it  is positivetechnical  change  that has  driven the  substitution of  capital  forlabor.  If,  on  the  other  hand, what  has  caused  this  substitution  is  arise  in  the relative  cost  of  labor  to  capital because labor  is moreexpensive, perhaps  because of  government mandates  or what  have you,then  really what we've had is  a supply  shock.  And that may explainwhy I hear  so much talk  about  inflation here  in  spite  of  the  fact  thatthe  help wanted index  is  at  the same  level  as  it  was at  the  depths  ofthe  1982  recession.  That surprised me;  no  one  is demanding  labor, yetwe're hearing about  inflation all  the  time.5/17/94-30-We're  going  to  have  to  see,  and  fortunately  this  is  not  themeeting where  we are going  to  find  out whether we  have to  go  tosomething more  restrictive.  I think  that  President  Jordan was  righton  target.  The thing  that  we have  forgotten  is  that during  anexpansion  the mix  in nominal GDP  between  inflation and  real  growthtends  to worsen.  In the  Greenbook forecast,  it's  not worsening;  it'sstaying at  about  50/50.  That probably  isn't going  to  happen.  IfGovernor  Kelley is  right, maybe  it  can  last  for a while  longer;  buthistory says  otherwise and my bet  is  that  in  three months  or  sixmonths we're  not  going  to be  talking  about neutrality.  Butfortunately we  can wait  for  three  to  six months  for  that  to  change.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Don,  I just wanted  to  ask  about the  April  taxpayments and whether you  think there  is  any peculiar behavioroccurring  that  may be  depressing M1  in  the  short  run.  A year  ago wehad a  similar  experience but you didn't mention  that  in  terms  of--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It's  hard  to parse  this,  President Melzer.  Infact,  April  tax payments were up  considerably from  last  year whilelast year  they were  low relative  to  the  year before.  It  is  true  thatthis  year's payments  were  less  than we and  everyone else  had expected.So  it's  a little  difficult  to  know exactly what  seasonals were builtin.  Before we  got  this  surge  in  early May, it  looked  as  if  theshortfall was  bigger, and the  low level  of  tax payments  in April wasone of  the  factors  we were  citing  as  a reason why M1  might have beenslow in April  because people hadn't  built up  their balances  in  orderto  pay taxes.  That  explanation  didn't  seem to  have as  much weightafter the  extra billions  came  in  in  early May and  the  tax receiptsover  the April-May period looked  as  if  they were  about  10  percenthigher  than  last year.  There might  still be  something  in  there  sinceM1  growth  this year  is  still  low relative  to  its  growth before  thelast  year.  It's  very difficult  to  know what seasonals  are  implicitlycalling  for.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Don, I read the Bluebook  as  saying  a 4-1/2percent  funds  rate  is  neutral  and here's  an  attempt  to  produce  thatkind of policy stance.  All  of  your  commentary was  in terms  of  the  "C"versus  "D" alternatives, a  1/4  point  versus  a  1/2  point  increase.  Youdidn't  discuss  the  pros  and cons  of  going immediately  to  4-1/2percent, assuming  that  that  is  a neutral  policy stance, nor did youdiscuss  the  possibility that  4-1/2  percent  is  too  low rather  than  toohigh.  A  lot  of  your  remarks were  in  terms of:  "Well, we're not  sureit's  4-1/2  percent;  it  might  be 4-1/4  percent  and there's  even  apossibility  it  might be  5, 5-1/2  or  6 percent."  Even  if  we went to4-1/2  percent  immediately, or  in  the  next  six months,  and  if  therewere no  movement  at all  in  bond yields,  no  effect  at  all,  you'd still5/17/94-31-have  300  basis points  between the  funds  rate  and long  rates.  Whathistorical  experience would  lead you  to  believe  that  a  300  basispoints  upward slope  in  the  yield curve  is  a neutral  monetary policy?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Well,  a couple  of points.  First,  as  between the4 and  4-1/4 percent,  I had assumed that  those were  the  two  options  onthe  table.  To be  sure, moving  eventually by more  can't  be  ruled  out--75  basis points  or  even more.  I tried,  but perhaps  it  didn't  comethrough  in my remarks,  to  raise  the  issue that  4-1/4  percent  certainlymight not be  enough;  and  I expressed some  concern that  we  not getstuck  calling this  neutral  and therefore  find  it  hard to  rise  beyondthat.  I agree  that  the  Committee certainly  needs  to  keep  its  optionsopen--that 4,  4-1/4,  even 4-1/2  percent may not be  sufficient.As  to  the  slope  of  the yield curve,  I think that's  been asometime  thing  in predicting economic  activity.  The yield curve wasextraordinarily steeply  sloped  for  several  years  in  this  currentexpansion before  the  expansion  seemed  finally to  have  gotten  under wayin  a self-sustaining  sense.  It's  certainly  true  that  the  markets havebuilt  into  this  spread more  tightening  than  the  staff  forecast.  Ithink it's  a question  of  judgment  as  to  where the  implied economicstrength  is.  Moreover,  in  judging  the yield curve  one has  to  takeaccount  of  uncertainties  and  liquidity premiums.  With all  theuncertainty and higher volatility,  some  of  the  level  of  long-termrates  is  reflecting  liquidity premiums,  not necessarily expectedmovements  in  funds  rates.  But  I don't  disagree with  the  the overallthrust  of  your  comment, which is  that  4 or  4-1/4  or  even 4-1/2  percent

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  there  are  no  further questions, whydon't  I begin?  One  of  the interesting aspects  of  this whole periodhas  been the  extraordinarily parallel  pattern of  movement betweendollar-denominated  long-term rates  and the  deutschemark and the  wholeseries  of  other currencies, despite  the  fact  that  there  are no  verypersuasive reasons  why all  of  these  rates  should be  fundamentallycoupled.  You have  to  ask yourself under what  conditions you get  acoupling of  rates  for noneconomic reasons,  or  for  reasons  other  thanthe basic  type  we  usually see.The  answer  essentially  lies  in  the notion, at  least  in myhypothesis,  that  if  there  is  a risk premium out  there which isgeneric, its  impact will  tend  to be  relatively the  same  depending noton what  currency  is  involved but whether  there  is  uncertainty aboutlong-term commitments  in  financial markets  and price  stability  in  theincrease  in  international portfolio holdings  of  many currencies,  thenif you  get a major element  of  uncertainty--for example,  if  I'm aportfolio manager  and I have  long  commitments  in  U.S. Treasuries  onthe  expectation that  prices  are  going  to  go up, and  the markets  goagainst  me--what has  happened  is  that my whole sense  that  "I know whatit's  doing" has  collapsed.  And  the  tendency, whenever uncertainty ofthat nature  arises,  is  for human beings  to  disengage from whateverthey're doing,  to  pull back.  And pulling back in the U.S.  Treasuryend of  the market,  tilting the  yield curve back up.  But  it  alsopresupposes  that  any element  of  speculative  uncertainty which existsin  the holdings  of  long-term deutschemark relative  to  short-termdeutschemark also  induces  an  adjustment by sales  of  longer-term5/17/94-32-securities  and purchases  of  shorter-term.  This  adjustment  obviouslycan  spill  over  into  all  sorts  of portfolio  holdings, provided there'sa large  amount  of  communication.It  is  just  very difficult  to  know why  it  is  that  U.S.  dollar-denominated issues have  so  dominated the markets,  and indeed why we  atthe  central  bank, by  tightening, have  obviously dislodged a lot  ofpositions while  creating a concept  which is  analogous  to  a genericrisk premium  that  explains not  the  intercurrency movements  but  themovements  from speculative positions--that  is,  from  longer-end price-sensitive positions  back  to  the  shorter  end.  It  also  explains  in partthe  nature  of  the  financial  bubble  that  we obviously have run  into.This  is  a very interesting phenomenon because what we  see  is  a verylarge  increase  in  implied volatility in  the  long  end of  the  marketcoming off  the options,  but  only a very modest  increase  in  the  yieldspreads  of  a number  of  the  different  types  of  instruments  we  use  tomeasure  credit  risk.  We've  gotten a very small  rise  in  the  rate  onsix-month  commercial  paper over  six-month Treasury bills;  BAAcorporate  yield increases  have been very small  relative  to U.S.Treasuries  during all  of  this  period.  Junk bond yield  spreads  are notmoving up, which  is  another way of  saying  that  the  concerns  about  theeconomy as  such  are not  being undermined by  all  of  this  financialinstability.  What we come up  against  here  is  that  there  is  a greatdeal  of  uncertainty and a  lot  of  nervousness.  And indeed  some  of  itis  purposeful  on  our part because  if  we are  going  to  pierce  thebubble, the  only way we're  going to pierce  it  is  essentially to  createa degree  of uncertainty.The  issue  of  uncertainty as  being helpful  or unhelpful  isreally not  clear-cut.  We  experienced periods  of  relative  certainty inthe  latter part  of  1993  which everybody just  looked at  as  though  theyield spreads  were very marginal, and  indeed they had all  been comingdown dramatically  from the  1987  peaks  after  the  stock market  crash,and there was  an  element  of  euphoria  that really  gripped the  markets.You  could see  that  in  huge  increases  in mutual  funds, both stock andbond  funds.  In  fact,  what we were dealing with  largely was  asituation  in  which there was  very little  uncertainty.  That  clearlywas  a very unhappy state  of  affairs;  the  mere  fact  that  uncertaintydid not  exist was  not a good;  it  clearly was  a bad.  And our endeavorto break  that pattern, which we had to  do  even  though  it  turned out  tobe  a much bigger problem  than we  suspected, was  a very purposefulendeavor to  create  a degree  of  uncertainty and  readjust holdings  fromweak hands  into  firmer hands  as  far  as  speculative securities  areconcerned.  As  a consequence we have  taken a very significant amountof  air  out  of  the bubble.  We had discussions  in  this  Committee not  onthe  desirability of  raising rates  and  tightening  the markets becausethe  economy needed  it--I  think  that was  a universal view--but  therehave been  differences  here about how much the  financial  system couldtake  before  its  tensile  strength broke.  And I  think what  we havereached in  conclusion at  this particular point  is  the  defusion of  agood part  of  the bubble.  I think  there's  still  a lot  of bubblearound;  we  have  not completely  eliminated  it.  Nonetheless, we havethe  capability  I would say at  this  stage to  move more  strongly  than weusually do without  the  risk of  cracking  the  system.I think  the  economy  is  probably stronger  than we  suspect,partly for  reasons  that  I raised back  in February;  the  inventory5/17/94-33-situation just  strikes  me as  too  tranquil,  and before  this  is  all  overI think we've got  to  get  something moving  on  the  inventory  side.  Lookat  the  lead times  on deliveries  of  materials;  they've  just  moved upmodestly.  Slowdowns  in promised  deliveries have  clearly moved up andthat's  far more  than an  issue  of  the  weather  in the month  of  February.So there are  the makings  here  of  stronger  inventory changes  than  Ithink we  recognize.The most  interesting aspect  of  the  economic  outlook as  I seeit  is  that  this  far  into  the recovery--and  it's  almost  immaterialwhether or not you  take Jerry's  view that  in effect we're  only  in thefirst year  of  the  recovery--the  actual  inflation rates, wage  rates,and  the  like  are  lower  than  one would ordinarily expect.  This  raisesthe question, which  I've  raised  in earlier meetings,  as  to  whether  thelack of  financial  tinder  is  a relevant  consideration here  in holdinginflation back.  The  truth of  the matter  is  that  it  almost  doesn'tmatter, because  as  Gary Stern said--and  I think quite  legitimately--weparticular  stage, with the  relative  lack of  imbalances  that  exist  inthe  economy,  that  the  chances  of  overdoing a  tightening of monetarypolicy and  creating a cascading down in  economic activity are  reallynot very  large.  If  we overdo  it,  what we will  do  is  push economicactivity farther  out.  The chances  of  our breaking  the back of  theeconomy at  this  point--with inventory  levels  as  low as  they are,capital  goods markets  still  with  significant momentum, and  the  ordersas  strong as  they are--have  to  be pretty low.  The obvious  problem isthat  errors  on  allowing inflation to  take  hold, even  if  the  data raisequestions  as  to whether  it  will,  involve  another  type  of  riskaltogether.  As  a central  bank we  obviously can't  take  that  kind  ofrisk.The  sentiment  of  the  Board of  Governors, as  you probablyknow,  is  to  move  the discount  rate,  as  nearly  all  the Reserve  Bankshave  requested, by 50  basis points  today.  And the  implicit view ofthe Governors  is  to  request  of  the Committee  that we  allow all  of  theincrease  to pass  through.  There  is  a balance  of  concerns  as  to  how weshould state  that,  but  if we  are going  to  act,  I do  think we  shouldindicate  that we are  taking out  a  substantial part  of  the  degree  ofaccommodation  that  existed  through  the 1993  period.  But  I'd leaveopen the  issue  of  any further  moves;  while  we may pause  for markets  tointerpret  that,  we ought  to  make adequate  leeway to  move should  eventsrequire  that we  do  so.  My own  impression  is  that  we probably will  nothave  to  move  before  the  next meeting  if  we  do  50  basis  points  now.I find  it unlikely that  we  are  near the  end of  this  pattern,but  I do think we  are  now becoming more data dependent.  There  reallyare  two  credible economic  scenarios  that  we  have  to  keep  in mind.  Oneis  something  quite  similar  to  the Greenbook  forecast  and, if  thatscenario evolves,  the  inflationary pressures on  the  system will  comedown.  If  it  doesn't  evolve,  if  we  still  have momentum in  the  system,I think the pressures are  going to  pick up  on us  to  move--notimmediately, but  sooner rather  than  later.  The  crucial  issue  as  faras  I'm concerned, however, even  though it's  not  a critical matter  inthe  forecast,  is  to  watch what's  happening to  the  financial  system--what's  happening to  bank  loans,  to  credit  extensions,  to  the degree  offinancial  tinder  that  is  either not moving or moving.  We  need to  bevery careful  about  this  very large  risk premium that  exists  in  thefinancial  markets,  which basically says  that  this bubble  is  a bigger5/17/94-34-one  than we had anticipated.  We've caused  a good part  of  it  todissipate, maybe  even most  of  it,  but  it's very obvious  from  theimplied volatility numbers  we're getting out of  the  options  that  theseSo,  I merely have put  the  issue  out  on  the  table.  I have aparticular view, were we to  move  50  basis points,  on whether we  shouldgo  symmetric  or asymmetric.  My preference  is  symmetric, but  frankly Idon't think  it means  very much because  if  the  economy accelerateswe'll be holding  special Committee  discussions, with or withoutsymmetry in  the  directive  language.  My own  inclination would be  to  gosymmetric  at  this  stage, but  I don't  feel  very strongly about  it.With  that  I open  this  issue up.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman, as  you know,  I've been aproponent  of  gradualism, but  I believe we're  at  the point where weneed to  take more  aggressive actions.  I think the  gradualisticapproach may have created some uncertainty in  the market.  I've  heardsome  of  the  same comments  as  were  reported earlier.  People havesuggested that  if  we are  going  to  do  something, we  ought  to  takestrong action.  So,  I'm really supportive  of  that  action.  I thinkthere  is  considerable momentum  in  the  economy.  Our  forecast,  as  Iindicated  earlier,  is  for stronger growth  than  the  Greenbook  forecast,and even  building in  50  basis points we  see the  inflation numbers  in1995  as  unacceptable.  So,  I think  that  there ought  to  be  a 50  basispoint pass-through to  the market,  and I would prefer  a symmetricdirective  as  well.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  I, too,  would support  a 50  basis point move  and Iprefer  a symmetric  directive.  I must  admit  I'm not  convinced at  thispoint  that our gradual  approach was  the  wrong one,  and  it  still  mayserve us well  in  the  future.  But  I do  think  50  basis points  isappropriate  at  this  time.  The  other point  I'd like  to make  is  that  Ihope  any public  statement we  make doesn't  convey either the  impressionthat we  are  likely to  do anything  in  the near  term  or  that we  arelikely to  rest  on our  oars  for  a while.  I think that--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Excuse me,  I'll  just  read you  a verypreliminary draft.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Which you just happen  to have!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I just happen  to have  it  here!  Thisimplies  that we move on  both the  discount rate  and the  funds  rate."These actions,  combined with the  three adjustments  initiated earlierthis year by  the  FOMC,  substantially remove  the  degree of  monetaryaccommodation which prevailed throughout  1993.  As  always,  the  FederalReserve will  continue  to  monitor developments in  the  economy andfinancial  markets  to  judge  the  appropriate  stance of  monetary policy."I think  that  captures where  we want  to be.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Good.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.5/17/94-35-

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan,  I would endorse what you recommended.  I'dlike  to  briefly state my reasons.  First  of  all,  as  you know  I'veviewed the  stance of  monetary policy as  having been very accommodativefor  some  time,  which  I think will  lay the  basis  for  an  acceleration ininflation.  Over  the  last three years,  for  example,  our net  openbillion, which  is  a  staggering number.  This  expansion  in  base moneyhas  fostered  a tremendous  increase  in liquidity, with  the  narrow moneystock, M1,  increasing by  one  third over  this  period.  Secondly, Idon't  think we've  gained credibility in  financial  and  foreign  exchangelet  alone achieving or moving  further  toward price stability.  Withrespect  to  the risk of  overdoing  it,  I would agree with what  you  said.One  of  the  things  I  looked at  in  that  connection  is  the prevailingforward rate  structure, which is  cited in  the  Greenbook;  itanticipates about  150  basis points  of  increase  in short-term  ratesbefore  the  end of  the  year.  So,  as  I say,  I don't  think this  move isoverdoing it.  In  fact,  if  we don't  keep up with sustained  increasesin market  interest rates,  I think we  run the  risk of  a policy thatcontinues  to  be  accommodative  and will  simply  increase  theinflationary pressures  down the  road.With respect  to  the  statement  that  you read,  I would beconcerned about  anything that  was  interpreted as  our having reachedneutrality, because  I don't  think we really know.  I'm a littleconcerned that maybe  those words--I  don't have  an  alternativesuggestion--too  strongly suggest  that  we've reached a neutral  stance.I just  don't  know what  that  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Neither  do we.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Needless to  say,  I support  your proposalenthusiastically, but  I share Tom Melzer's  feelings.  When  I heard  thestatement  I had  the same  kind of  feelings  that  you had, Tom--that itneutrality.  Maybe we  can work on  it  a little bit.  Also,  along  thoselines,  I don't have  really strong  feelings  about  the language  of  thedirective, but  I think a  symmetric  directive would  tend to  create  theimpression that we  have  reached a plateau.  So,  while  I would accept asymmetric directive,  I have a preference for  an asymmetric directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I support  a 1/2  point  increase,  the  symmetricdirective, and  I like  the  draft  statement  the way  it  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  I support  the proposal  in  its  entirety.  I am alittle  concerned--somebody mentioned  this  earlier--about the  commentswe  get  from  time  to  time  that  we ought  to  take whatever  actions  we'regoing  to  take  and  then pause.  I don't  think  the  statement gives  the5/17/94-36-impression  that  we're necessarily  locking ourselves  into  that  for  anyextended period of  time.  I guess what  I'm concerned about  is  a viewin  the markets now,  and I don't  know why  it  should  arise  now, that  weare more clairvoyant  than we  are--that  we somehow  know where we'regoing and when we're  going  to  stop.  And  I think we  ought  to becareful  and try not  to  convey  that  impression.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I endorse  the  proposed moves,  both of  them.  Theeconomic  case continues  to  exist  for  this move  and I  think we do  havea window  of  opportunity for  making it.  I support  symmetric  language.I am a  little concerned  about  the  statement  giving the  impression  thatwe  are satisfied  or  that  this pause may run a while,  although  I can'tthink  of  a better way of  saying it.  That's  the  only concern  I have,Mr.  Chairman.

MR. KEEHN.  Well, Mr. Chairman,  I certainly  support  theproposal.  The  only question  I have  is  a  technical  one.  Is  this  asingle  announcement  today and  is  it  going to  be  announced by you orannounced by the  Committee  or--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's  going  to  be  announced as  a part  ofthe  discount  rate  announcement.  In  other words,  there's  no need tomake  two  separate  announcements.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's  not  by me;  it  will  be by Joe  Coyne.Governor LaWare.

[SECTION]

MR. LAWARE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I'm very pleased to  support  yourrecommendation,  and I think  the  elegance of  the  language permits  theinterpretation that  was  intended--that we may still  be probing,  thatwe are not  sure  that  we are  at  neutrality, that  we have taken  asignificant  step  forward, but we're not  at  all  committed to  standingpat.  I just  think  the  language  is  beautifully  composed.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  One  suggestion,  I'm sorry  to  butt in,  but  maybethe  phrase  "significantly reduces"  rather  than  "substantiallyremoves."  I don't  know whether  that--

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We played with that.  I think it's  atricky  issue  and  I'm  trying  to  avoid--if we ever  tried  to  write  acommunique  around this  table we would be  here  for  a good six months!President  McTeer.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I also  support  your  recommendation.  It  seemsto me  that  it  is  appropriate  to  go  ahead and make our  statement  in  theseries  of  moves  of  25  basis  points, we talked  about  the  notion that5/17/94-37-when we think  the  series  of  moves  should come  to  an  end we  should  sosignal.  I don't  think--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  was  at  the point  when we  thought  thatthe  structure  of  the  financial  markets  could  take more.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Right,  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  At  the very beginning we were  concernedthat we would be  hitting  the markets  too  hard.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I don't know whether we're  at neutrality ornot.  There  is  an  argument  that  we may well  be  at  neutrality becausewe may be getting more of  a kick  from our  tightening actions  as  aresult  of  the  increase  in  long-term rates.  So,  in any case,  I supportyour recommendation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Your  initial  remarks  I think are very important.We  can  learn a fair  amount  if we  think more  about what's  going on withrelative  yields.  Normally when we  think about  a relative  move  it'seither  by quality spreads,  by currency denomination,  or by maturity.At  one  time  I studied the behavior of  interest rates  in periods  ofcrisis  atmosphere relating  to  an  international  event:  Suez,  the  Bayof  Pigs  Cuban missile crisis,  the Yom  Kippur War,  Iraq in  1990,  and soon.  The yield curve  always  steepens very sharply as  portfoliomanagers  shorten their horizons.  As  the  uncertainty dissipates  theyield curve flattens.  That's  quite  different  from  the  cyclicalbehavior of  the  yield curve  as  an expansion matures.  I think  thatwe're  closer  to  conditions of  1978  than we  are  to  some  otherhistorical  episodes.  In  April  1978  President Carter  said  that  therewas no  danger that  excess  demand would spill  over and raise pricesjust  when  the  latter were  about  to  explode.  And  through  1974,  1975,and  1976,  as  you recall,  the economy was  fairly tranquil;  wages  werefairly well  behaved.  Some of  this  started  to  change  a little  in  1977,but  nobody saw  it  coming.  At  least  I certainly didn't.  TheAdministration had misread the  situation in  1978  because  they lookedat  things  like wages;  they looked at  a  lot  of  things  and  said therewas no problem with inflation, and they were  wrong.  They never saw itcoming.  And I'm  concerned that  we may be wrong again.  It  struck mein  the  go-around earlier  that  at  least  some  of you  looking  at  theworld  from  inside  the beltway--Governors Kelley, LaWare,  and Phillips--have  a different  feel  of  the  economy than what  I sense  from  theother  twelve  of  us.  Certainly I thought  this  was  a marked  difference,and I'm not  sure  quite what  to  make  of  that.I'm not  troubled with  the  idea  of  saying we're  at  neutral  andwe're on  hold.  If  a very powerful move had  to  be made, we would actanyway.  None  of  us  is  going  to  know in  advance whether any  25  basispoint difference  is  significant  or not, whether  it's  to  4-1/4  or  4-1/2or  4-3/4  percent.  But  to me  it's  quite  different  to  say we're  at4-1/2  percent and we  think that  it's  just  as  likely the  next move  isdown  as  up  sometime  out  in  the  future.  Being neutral  implies  an equalprobability that  the  next move will  be down  as  up;  we never  know this.If  this  group  walks  out  of here  today saying we're at  4-1/4  percentand most people's  commentary is,  as  it  has  been  after  the  last  coupleof  meetings,  that we've got more  to  go,  I would  find  that  troubling.5/17/94-38-I would much  rather  if  everybody walked out  and said we're  at  4-1/4percent  and we  don't know whether the  next move  will  be  down or up.To me  that's  a  lot different  than  the  majority  of people  responding inthe  weeks ahead, as  we  get queries  about  this,  saying:  "Well, we'renot  quite  at neutral;  we've  got more  to  go."  That adds  uncertainty tothe  bond market  that  I don't view as  constructive.  I would ratherhave  a  stronger  statement  that  we don't  know when we're going to moveagain  and if  we do,  it  might  be down or  up.  If  people are notcomfortable with  that  4-1/4  percent,  let's  go  to  4-1/2  percent  and doa  full  point  on  the  discount  rate.  I'd rather  do more  than less.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I  support  the  50  basis  pointincrease  in  the  funds  rate  and  the  symmetric  directive.  I think  it  isgoing  to be  seen as  a very powerful  action  by the  marketplace bothinside  the United States  and out.  I do  think  that we have  to  make astatement.  There will  be people whose  only view of  the  world is  basedon  their  own  trading positions  who will  be  disappointed by our  notsaying  the word of  God is  that  this  is  it  for  some  extended period  oftime.  We can't  say that  and shouldn't  say that,  but  I think we  shouldbe  aware  that  it  is  not a  sure  thing  that  this  action plus  thestatement,  which  I think makes  a great  deal  of  sense, will  necessarilystabilize  the  financial  markets.  I hope  it  does,  and  it  probably willafter  a couple  of  days,  but  it  need not  happen  in  the  hour or  two  oreven  a day  or  so after  the  meeting.  I believe  it  will be very wellreceived outside  the United  States where  attitudes  are  to  asubstantial  degree  affected  or  influenced by our  fellow  centralbankers.  The Chairman was  at  the  last  BIS meeting  and,  if  I may sayso,  did an unusually good  job of  explaining the  U.S. position,  and  Idon't  think anybody who  attended  that meeting will  have any doubt  thatthis  is  a very  firm, decisive  action.  And I  think we  will be  verymuch applauded by our  fellow central  bankers  in  many of  the  countriesaround  the world.

There's  a  level  of  uncertainty about  theeconomy  and about  the  financial  markets  that  causes me  to  express  someuncertainty about my interest rate  objective.
