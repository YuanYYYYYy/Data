CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I would like to welcome three newcomers  to theseproceedings--Jane  Little  from Boston, George  Kahn  from  Kansas City, and Steve  Cecchetti  fromNew York.  This  is their first meeting  and as I have  indicated previously  to individuals who havecome and gone,  they will  not learn  very much economics  but large amounts  of chaos theory!  Ithink that was  a welcome, but  I'm not quite sure.  [Laughter]We need the  approval  of the minutes  for the July  1-2 meeting.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Move  approval.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  I would like to move  the  electionof Steve  Cechetti as Associate  Economist for the Federal Reserve  Bank of New  York to  serve untilthe election  of his successor  at the first meeting of the  Committee after December 31,  1997.  I verymuch hope that his  successor will be himself.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Let us move on to Mr. Fisher.  Peter.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be  referring to  theseveral pages of colored charts  distributed this morning. 1In  reviewing recent market developments,  I will  try to describe what Isee  as the causes  of the recent, abrupt repricing and volatility of equity,bond, and  currency  values.1 Copies  of the charts used by Mr. Fisher are appended  to this transcript  (Appendix  1).8/19/97First, since your last meeting,  there have been noteworthy  shifts in  theinterest  rate  outlook for the United States,  Germany,  and Japan.  While eachof these movements  may  appear small, in perspective  and in conjunctionthey  can be understood  as causing a  significant increase  in risk to whichSecond,  to my way of thinking, it is  not helpful  to view the dollar'smovement--or  exchange  rate  movements  generally--as  "causing"  the  sell-off in bond and equity markets.  The  dollar's recent  movements  appear toreflect  the same  reassessment of the  outlook that has  affected  other markets.Third,  I think the  recent volatility in markets can,  in part, be attributedto the difficulty  all market participants  are  having in coming  to grips withthe  extraordinary  performance of the U.S. economy.  In this sense,  therecent volatility reflects  the contest between  "old"  and  "new"  paradigms.Looking  at the  first page  of charts, which  depicts  forward rateagreements  and Euro-deposit rates  from August  1996 for the  dollar, theindicating three-month  deposit rates,  nine months  forward--which  occurredfollowing  the  August  1st  release of the nonfarm payroll  data and the NAPMsurvey.  In the  blue lines,  you can see  the consistent  rise in  German forwardrates  from mid-July.  At the bottom, you can  see the recent,  continuedThe rally in  U.S. interest rate  markets, which  started in the  spring,continued  in the  last two weeks  of July.  That rally  was propelled by thecombination of reduced expectations  for any  near-term Committee  actionfollowing the Chairman's  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony  and expectationsfor reduced Treasury  issuance  as a consequence  of the improved  fiscaloutlook.The August  1st  release  of the nonfarm  payroll and NAPM  reportscaused  a modest  increase  in  expectations  for a tightening by the Committeebefore  year-end,  with the December Fed funds futures backing  up by  14basis points in  six days.  As you  can see in the FRA chart, late last week thebackup  in interest rates reversed  at the time of the rapid decline in equitybasis points in the  nine trading  days from July  3 1st.Looking back across  the past year, this  move  is comparable to theincreases  in the  9-by-12 that  occurred in December and February.  InAmerican  Enterprise  Institute,  the 9-by-12 backed up by  30 basis points inthirteen  trading days; in response to the Chairman's  Humphrey-Hawkins8/19/97testimony  in February, the 9-by-12 backed up by 28 basis points  in just sixtrading days.Trend  reversals  such as these, reflecting only  a modest increase  in theprobability  of a tightening  of monetary policy, also tend to  cause marketparticipants  to reassess  the likely consequences  of still  seemingly  remoteevents.  Most market participants  still think that an increase in rates by theCommittee  is not  likely to occur at this meeting  or the next.  But given thelofty levels  to which bond and  equity markets  had  traded, even a  smallincrease in the  likelihood  of an event which could have such extreme,negative  consequences  for asset values  causes  traders  to reduce theirexposures.To put the same  thought differently:  for those  still working in the "oldparadigm,"  uncertainty  premia were squeezed  awfully tight by the end ofFed funds target rate;  some backup in interest rates  and a collateral  selloffin equities  were accidents  waiting to happen.  In conjunction with thereversal  of the U.S. rate outlook,  after the mark began to weaken  sharply  inmid-July  market participants  also have had to  respond to the escalatingrhetoric  from Bundesbank officials  threatening  an increase  in rates.On July 24 th, the Bundesbank  Council met and  announced  that theirrepo  operations would continue  at the fixed rate  of 3 percent but only forthe  first two weeks of their four-week  holiday until  the next Councilmeeting.  This suggested  that the Bundesbank Directorium  would have theopportunity to  change the repo rate by either  moving to a variable  ratetender  or raising the fixed rate  last week.  However, they announced  onemore  operation  at the  fixed 3  percent  rate last week,  and this morning  theyannounced  one more operation  at 3 percent.From the Bundesbank's  perspective,  this saber rattling has had twobeneficial  effects:  It has created a much greater sense of two-way  risk in theDeutsche mark anditself in the pre-monetary  union environment.Now, the Bundesbank  faces something of a  dilemma--or a couple  ofdilemmas.  First, the German  economy is providing  mixed signals:  somemeasures of activity are picking  up and, as a consequence  of the decline  inthe mark this year, officials  expect import price inflation to begin to showup in the data.  On  the other hand, high unemployment continues;  ongoingproblems in  implementing  tax reform suggest that consumption  demandwill remain  weak, and M3  growth continues to slow.  Thus, on strictlydomestic grounds,  a decision  to increase  rates would be finely balanced.8/19/97Second, it is not clear how markets  would respond  to  a rate increase  inthe context of European monetary  union. To the extent that  an increase inrates  by the Bundesbank  were to be perceived  as hostile to the EMUprocess,  causing delay  or postponement or a narrowing of the field of likelymember countries,  it might then be  expected to cause the mark tostrengthen.However,  much of the Bundesbank's  rhetoric  of the last few  weeks  hasbeen  in service  to the idea that an  increase  in rates  would be consistent withand supportive of EMU,  suggesting that European  monetary  policy shouldnot be frozen  in place until the ECB is  created and that the convergenceprocess  could be completed by German  rates  rising to meet Italian  rates.To the  extent that  market participants  believe this,  in the event that theBundesbank  were to raise rates,  it is not clear that German  long-term rateswould move very much, or that  the mark  would appreciate  much  more thanit did last week.Japanese  forward  rates reflect the continued  unwinding of expectationsfor any near-term firming  by the Bank of Japan, particularly following  theth release  of the Bank of Japan's  Quarterly  Report and the July 30threlease  of weaker-than-expected  June  industrial production  data.  As  youcan see at the bottom of the page,  the rise in rates  that occurred in May--inresponse  to official pronouncements  that things were  not as bad as theyseemed--has  now been completely reversed as  market participants  havecome to see  the Japanese  economy to be as  weak as they originally feared.The 9-by-12 forward rate  is now returning to the levels  where it wastrading in March, at the end of the last Japanese  fiscal year when  gloomwas widespread.  On August  15th and again today,  the yield on thebenchmark  No.  182 Japanese  government  bond hit a new, historic  low of2.065 percent.Turning to the next page,  a  further jolt to the global  outlook has comein the rush of currency  devaluations  in Southeast Asia.  Over the course  ofthe spring and  summer, media attention  has shifted  back and forth betweendescribing these events  as  "speculative  attacks"  on  the one hand  and"competitive devaluations"  on the other.  Increasingly,  emphasis is nowplaced on the  latter.  While much of the focus has been  on the devaluationof these  currencies  against the dollar, shown in the top panel, their declinesagainst  the yen since May  1st have been  even more  impressive,  which is notlikely to do much to improve the  outlook for the Japanese  export sector.Turning to the third page of charts--8/19/97

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Peter, may I interrupt you  for a moment?  Wouldyou remind everybody  what a  3-by-6, a  6-by-9, and a  9-by-12  are?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It  is not a question  of "reminding!"  What are they?[Laughter]  Let me put it this way:  I have  never heard that term except  as used by  you in this room.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  All right.  As I mentioned  at the outset,  [laughter]  a 9-by-12  is the3-month rate traded 9 months  forward.  So, 9 plus  3  is  12--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Now,  stop!  [Laughter]  The arithmetic  is easy, but whydon't you use English?  This is market jargon whose use is restricted  to  a very few acressurrounding  your office in New York.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think the  new technology is spreading  it out all the way to New Jerseyand Westchester!  The 3-by-6  is the 3-month  rate  as it trades  3 months  forward.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Why didn't you say  so?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Where were  we?  [Laughter]  As I mentioned at theoutset, I do not think  it is  helpful to see exchange  rate movementsgenerally,  or the dollar's movements  in particular,  as  an exogenous  "cause"of bond and  equity market volatility.  Rather,  I think that exchange marketshave been responding to the same  shift in outlook that has influenced otherIn the first panel  you can  see the dollar's movements  against the mark,in blue,  and against the yen, in red, since May  1st. In July,  the dollar ralliedsharply  against the mark  as the idea of a broad and timely EMU processbecame generally  accepted.  The  dollar came  off against the mark in  earlymovement in German  rates;  as these risks declined, the dollar has jumpedback up a bit against the mark  in the last few days.  The dollar appreciatedmodestly  against the yen in July as the Japanese  outlook deteriorated  andrecently has been  more stable  against the yen than against the mark.Looking at the movements  in bond  and equity markets,  depicted in  thesecond  and third  panels, I see a case of correlation in their responses  tocommon  impulses, not causation.Finally, just as  members  of the Committee  have  been surprised by theperformance  of the United States  economy  in sustaining low inflation  and8/19/97relatively strong  activity,  so too have market  participants.  Surprises--evenpleasant  ones, like  the combination  of last Wednesday's  PPI and retail salesreleases--tend  to create  uncertainty,  and uncertainty needs  to be  priced intoAnother way  to view this, depicted on the  fourth page,  is as  a contestbetween the old and new  paradigms  and, specifically,  among the diverseviews now being expressed  in market behavior.  "Old paradigm  pessimists"think that inflation  is about to break out;  it has just been hiding in the lags.They  think the Fed is "behind the  curve," providing  too much liquidity.  Inresponse to last Wednesday's  data, old paradigm pessimists  would beinclined  to sell stocks  and bonds  short."Old paradigm  optimists"  think  inflation is probably coming  soon, butit's hard to tell.  They think the Fed is doing a good job and that maybe thisbenign inflation  behavior can be kept going for a few  more quarters.  Manyold paradigm optimists  are reformed  old paradigm pessimists, whosepessimism became  too expensive  a few thousand Dow points ago.  Thus,they remain cautious:  buying stocks  and bonds  on dips and  selling them onrallies."New  paradigm optimists"--who  have done rather well over the pastyear or  so--think that we have  entered a new era in which  productivitygrowth, hidden in  the macro  data, is taming inflation.  They think the Fed  isdoing  a great job and are great admirers of the  Chairman.  In response tolow inflation and  strong activity, they do what they always do:  buy  loads  ofstocks  and some bonds whenever  they can."New paradigm pessimists"  are only recently getting the attention theythink they  deserve.  The  lack of corporate  pricing power, theindustrialization  of China, the chronic  weakness  of Japan  and Europe,  thecompetitive  devaluations  of the  United Kingdom  and Italy a few years  agoand, now, of all of Southeast Asia, are signs of the coming  global capacityglut.  They think the Fed is much too tight.  They look at the PPI and retailsales data and see deflation  staring them in the  face  and the last gasp of theU.S.  consumer  before the  deflationary  reality sinks  in;  they, therefore,  sellstocks and buy Treasuries--not  corporate bonds, just Treasuries.While some  of the recent volatility can perhaps  be  attributed to thin,interaction  of these four archetypes'  diverse responses  to the same  data andof the movement of market participants  among these  four types.  Much ofthe rally  of this year can be thought of as having been  propelled by themigration of old paradigm pessimists  to old paradigm optimists  and of oldparadigm  optimists to new paradigm optimists.  Much  of the recent8/19/97retrenchment  can be thought  of as old paradigm  optimists  hedging againstthe risks of either old paradigm  pessimism or new paradigm pessimism.Turning to domestic operations,  reserve needs  were  somewhat moremoderate  than in preceding  intermeeting  periods  and  we tended to useshorter-term  operations to meet those needs.  The next page of chartscontrasts  the volatility of Fed funds trading and  operating balances  incomparable  periods  from  last summer  and this summer.  The  daily range ofFed funds trading is  shown in blue;  the one-standard  deviation  of fundstrading around  the daily effective rate  and the effective  rate are  depicted  inred;  below  each  is a bar chart showing  daily operating balances.  Atdiscernibly  lower levels of operating  balances  this year as compared  to last,we  have  actually had modestly less  volatility in the funds rate, as  measuredboth by the range and by the  standard  deviation.Mr. Chairman,  we had no foreign exchange  intervention  operationsduring  the period.  Committee  members have received  materials describinghow we  intend to manage  the diversification  of a small  portion of theSystem's Deutsche mark holdings into a sub-portfolio  of longer-datedGerman  government securities,  which the  Committee approved  in principlelast September.I would be  happy to answer any questions  about this material,  or aboutany aspect of my report this morning.  I will need  the  Committee'sratification  of the Desk's domestic  operations during  the period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  How serious is the  most recent pressure on the HongKong  dollar?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It  is certainly worthy of note.  I do not have  an exact read this morning,but the forward  exchange rates  have backed  up quite  a bit in the last  10  days.  I am told anecdotallythat the pressure is from prudent asset managers  who are hedging risks,  not speculators poised foran attack.  I don't know  how much value I  can place  on that information.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I talked  with Hong  Kong Monetary  Authority  officials last night, andthey did not seem  particularly concerned.  Their mode of operation is one that in  some sense  tendsto draw attention, because  in  essence they meet  a demand  for Hong Kong dollars  when it arises,  butthey automatically  tighten their money markets.  That's why we've seen a rise  in their short-term8/19/97rates, which they hope will be  enough to  adjust  financial market  balance.  There does  seem to me  tobe a  question  as to how long the peg of the  Hong Kong dollar against the U.S.  dollar is going  tolast.  The current mechanism  is somewhat  artificial,  and now that the artificiality  of the  other pegsin Southeast  Asia has been revealed,  there is some  sense that the  Hong Kong authorities  are  nearerthe time when  they will have  to make a decision  on  this issue.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Is that true of the other Southeast Asian  currencies  aswell?  Are they  going to let their currencies  float?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I don't think they know what they are going  to do,  quite frankly.  Infairness,  they  face a difficult problem.  President Minehan  and I were at a conference last week,  anda very bright woman  from Indonesia  asked what advice  we had for them now that they had floatedtheir currency.  Mike  Mussa of the International  Monetary Fund replied  that at a  minimum theyshould not freely  float but should have  some sort of managed  float and  should re-orient  the basketof foreign  currencies  in terms of which they had sought to maintain  their own currency's  value  sothat the basket  is less heavily weighted toward  the  dollar.  He added that  that was the end  of hisadvice.  My comment to her  was that it was very good advice, although it was only about 25percent operational  in terms  of what  they really  needed to do.  They have a relatively  small openeconomy,  so the notion that they can ride the roller coaster  of international  financial  disturbances  isvery difficult  for them to accept.  Their financial markets  do not have the depth or resiliency  that isnecessary  to allow them  to go,  for example,  to a Canadian  style  of monetary  conditions  index andexpect to have  the sort of gyroscopic  stability  that the Canadian  dollar has displayed.  It is a realproblem  for them, and  we should not underestimate  it.  Perhaps  monetary  union with the Japanese--[Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.8/19/97

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I have  a follow-up  question based  on some of the conversations  at theconference.  It was rather  striking to a  few people there,  as  it probably  is to a lot of people  in thisroom,  that as compared with our involvement  with Mexico  and in  IMF packages in  general,  therewas  no specific  U.S.  involvement in the  Thai baht situation.  I am  sure that some  people in thisroom view that  as highly positive and other  people may not.  I wonder whether there is  anyperspective on this.  Is  this a new paradigm going forward  that  we do not get involved in thesethings, or is it solely related to how much the Thai baht is going to impact the  United States?  Whatis the thinking?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  With respect to the baht?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Ted, why don't you take a minute and review  that.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think there are  two points to be made.  One--about which it wouldseem appropriate  to inform the Committee in any event--is  that the United States  government wasvery concerned  about this  from the beginning.  In fact, this  issue came up last March  and I think itis fair to say,  as Governor Meyer can attest based  on meetings  he attended,  that this  is an accidentthat did not particularly  surprise  us.  Once the pressure built in March, we were  in the awkwardposition, partly because  of U.S. political opinion,  of not wanting  to be perceived  as pushing theThai authorities into an  action that I believe  most observers  thought was inevitable.  The Thaisand they have  a very serious problem  in termsof restoring  confidence  and the stability of the baht.  The Treasury's  position basically  was toencourage  the Thais to engage  with the International  Monetary Fund, which  has a traditional  viewon these types  of things,  and to urge the Japanese  to restrain from pouring money into Thailanduntil the Thais had fully arranged their loan from the International  Monetary  Fund.  When  it came8/19/97time for the Fund to put forward  its package  with the augmentation of bilateral  assistance--a  quiteunusual feature  and one that  the Fund tried  to put together in connection with Mexico but could notfind countries  that were  willing to take  on the direct Mexican  risk in the way  the Asians areprepared to take on the  direct Thai  risk--the  Treasury had to contemplate,  in consultation  with theChairman, whether to participate  in this arrangement.  Post Mexico,  as you may remember  fromour discussion of the renewal  of the swap  lines,  the Treasury  is under much tighter constraintsabout what it does with the Exchange  Stabilization  Fund than it was in the past.  So, the Treasurywould have had  to jump a lot more hurdles  to participate,  and  they have a number of otherproposals  before  Congress that  require political  support.  The latter include the approval  of the NewArrangements  to Borrow,  which  is on the legislative  agenda,  and the potential approval  of an IMFquota increase.  So, on balance,  they  said that they would like to participate  for purely geopoliticalreasons, but for internal  political  reasons it would be risky for them to do so.  They have  said theycan anticipate  some  step-up in EX-IM Bank financing,  but that financing  is tied aid as opposed  tothe untied aid contained  in the rest of this Fund package.The one thing that we and the Treasury  have done is to put  forward a proposal,  whichhas now been accepted,  to provide some backstopping  in the form of short-term  liquidity bridgefinancing.  This was in  the works  from the beginning.  We were  sufficiently  skeptical  about theability of the Fund to raise  this medium-term money in Asia that we tried, and were  largelysuccessful,  not to put this forward as an  alternative  but rather as a supplement to the basic package.Agreement  on that package  has now been reached by the G-10 countries  and a few non G-10countries.  It is expected  to be announced  tomorrow  or Thursday after the IMF approves the Thaiprogram.  That program provides  a degree of political,  if you want to put it that way, orinternational monetary  support for the operation,  but obviously not on the  scale to which the8/19/97Japanese  and the Southeast Asian and  other Asian countries  have participated.  Some people  inAsia think that the Japanese they put up $4 billion andeverybody else put up  $6 billion,  which is  a higher fraction  than we  got with Mexico.  On the  otherhand,  as President  Minehan knows,  the Japanese  were represented  at our conference by Mr.Sakakibara, who observed thatSo, I don't think we've heard the end of this.  For your information,  thisarrangement probably  will be  announced Thursday  morning  or late tomorrow  afternoon  and willinclude a conventional  bridge loan--the  amount will not be announced--that  is intended to bridge tosome World Bank  and ADB  disbursements that  are part of the package.  The BIS will  be putting upthe bridge loan money and  will be backstopped  as an  agent by the Federal  Reserve  Bank of NewYork and ultimately  the  Exchange  Stabilization  Fund.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Ted,  have you had any discussions either with the  Peoples Bank of Chinaor the Hong Kong Monetary  Authority  about the political  commitment to  peg the Hong Kongdollar?  It would seem to me that there would  be a lot of vulnerability associated  with making  anychange very soon.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  I think everybody in the room has heard  in one  form or another thatthey have  a very  strong political commitment.  I was referring  to the future.  At this point, it seemsto me that it would be very difficult for them to abandon the  current policy.  The Hong Kong dollaronly two months after the hand-over,  no matter what one thinks about the long-term  viability  of thecurrent exchange  rate regime.  One also  could say that they ought to pick some point of relativecalm in the  next five  years and  adjust their exchange  rate regime.  They  will face  some of the same8/19/97kinds of issues as they do now concerning  which way  they should adjust, and if some of theireconomists  were to say that they have the  right answer,  I would not believe them.Let me just add the fact that Hong  Kong and  China have participated  in the Thaifinancing  arrangement  and they also  are  going to participate in the bridge financing;  there's notmuch risk associated  with the latter.  It is essentially  an operational  risk--symbolic  in my view oftheir perceiving themselves  as having  a big stake in  stabilizing this situation  for exactly the reasonthat they do not want to confront these difficult questions  concerning  the Hong  Kong dollar rightaway.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Ted, in the Mexican  bailout, we gave  them money to refinance  theirtesobonos,  their dollar-guaranteed  debt.  What is the money being loaned to Thailand to be usedfor?

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  You can use the word  "bailout,"  but I am not allowed  to.  Thefinancial situation  in Thailand is in some  respects  much more problematical  than was the case inMexico.  They  have something on the order of $38  billion in  short-term obligations.  Most  are bankobligations,  of which more than half are  to Japanese  banks.  They also have a very large forwardposition  that is  approximately  equal  to their gross  reserves.  The amount of money being put up,about $16  billion,  is relatively small.  If we net out the forward position against  the foreignexchange  reserves,  their reserves  position is no better than Mexico's  was.  In  a sense they aregetting some $16  billion in this package  against $40 billion of short-term obligations,  which aremostly private-sector  debts.  In that  sense the whole program is predicated  on the assumption ofcredibility rather than a bailout because the money  is not sufficient to allow all these short-termlines to run off.  In the Mexican  case,  we had a package  of close  to $40 billion  against essentially$40 billion of short-term bank obligations  and  tesobonos.  We tend to  forget that there were  a lot of8/19/97bank obligations in the Mexican case,  but they were  as vulnerable  as  the tesobono  problem.  In fact,in the  short run Mexico did lose some  dollars  through the banking  system, but they recovered quitequickly.  So, in  that sense  that financing package  was less problematic.Two elements  of moral  hazard are  involved in this case.  One has to do with the peopleon Peter's  acreage  who conduct their business, but do not book their positions, on that  acreage.They are on  the other  side of many, but not all, of the forward  liabilities  of the Bank of Thailand.You  could say that the system is financing the Thai central bank's ability to meet its  commitments.It would be a tricky business  if the Thais were to  start to default on their foreign  exchangecontracts.  It would change  the nature  of the business.  The second element  is a little moreconventional.  It has to do with what should be done with the obligations  of banks in Thailand.  TheThai central  bank already has expended  16  billion--that's in baht, not dollars--to  bail out domesticinstitutions  whose  operations have  now been  suspended. They have been  quite successful  insterilizing it, but it has become  in effect  an obligation  of the Thai  government  as  a whole.  It wouldbe one thing  to stiff bondholders  and  still another  to stiff commercial  banks  that might be expectedto come in and help support the  Thai financial  system as a whole.  The goal  is to keep  the centralbank's gross and  net reserve positions  from  going  to zero as they run down these forwardobligations.  I think that  is the simple  answer to your question.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Any further questions?  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Alan, I just want to make an  observation  on another issue  for Peter.  Weare a fairly substantial  holder of inflation-indexed  Treasury  securities  in our portfolio, 5  percent ofthe  outstandings or something  like that.  Looking  down the road,  as  those securities  become  moreuseful  as guides  to monetary  policy in terms of giving us insight into inflation  expectations  and realrates, I wonder whether we ought to be investing  in that market.  In other words, if the perception  is8/19/97that we  are a significant enough  player to affect  how those markets trade,  it may undermine theusefulness of the information.  I don't expect  an  answer right now.  I  assume that our purchaseshave been on the  same basis  as they are  for any other  Treasury  securities, but we  may want to thinkabout continuing  to acquire those  obligations as we go forward,  perhaps  as they become  moreuseful  to us from  an information point of view.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  That's a very good thought.  Let me  make  a few  observations  for thebenefit of the  whole Committee.  First, we are  treated  as an "add-on"  in the  Treasury's  issuance  atthe long end, so  our purchases  do not reduce what the Treasury  issues to the public.  Whether tobuy such obligations  at all was  a bit of a dilemma for us.  If the  Treasury  launches  a new programand we do not buy any of the securities,  there is a risk of a negative  inference  for the newinstrument  that the Treasury is marketing.  There  is also a risk that if the new type of securitybecomes a major vehicle for Treasury  funding  and we have  not bought any  such  securities, we willneed to buy them in order to  keep the  SOMA portfolio  invested  in the  deepest area  of theTreasury's  issuance.  On the other side of the dilemma,  obviously, the notion of central bankpurchases  of inflation-indexed  securities  has  a certain  odd ring to it.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  That occurred  to me.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  But as  I noted, we  are not  a net subtractor of market supply because  theTreasury treats  us as  an "add-on."  An  additional reason for holding  some of these  securities was tohave them available  for our securities lending program.  You inspired me to comment on thatprogram  at an earlier  meeting, and  I have told the Committee that we are  trying to come up with anew program.  I hope to come back to the Committee  during the fall with some new  ideas for that.It might well  help the inflation-indexed  market  if we were in an improved  position to lendsecurities to  that market.8/19/97contracts.

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  the Board  of Trade is considering those, but when you  said"forward"  I thought about the over-the-counter  forward  market.

MR.  KOHN.  There are  futures markets  in both the 5-year  and the  10-year issues.  Thoseissues  are eligible  to trade in  those markets,  but as  of a week  ago there had been essentially  notrades--a  few trades in the  10-year  bond--and no positions.  I believe the markets also  obtainedpermission  to trade  options on the futures  contracts,  but there had not been any  such trading as of aweek or two  ago.  So, the markets  are there but they are not being used.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Without objection.  Thank you  very much.  Mike  Prell,you are on.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman. In the opening  sentence  ofthe Greenbook,  we  characterized  the economy  as continuing  "to  hum alongin recent months."  As of last Thursday,  we  were able  to report that hiringremained  strong  and that high-spirited  consumers were  once  again spendingheavily  at auto dealers  and other retail outlets.  Now we can report thathomebuilders  are busy, too.  According to this morning's  release,  which issummarized  in the table you  received, total housing  starts were unchanged inour guess,  but permits  for such units were off 2 percent.  On the whole, thesedata, along with the upbeat report  from the homebuilders  survey for earlyquite well at this juncture.Indeed, the basic point is that the indicators now in  hand provide  fewdirect hints that economic  expansion will be limited to the relativelymoderate path that we think is ahead.  We  are predicting  that real GDPgrowth will average just 2-1/4 percent over the next few quarters--wellbelow the 3-1/4  percent rate  of the past year.  And as you know,  a slowing ofat least this degree likely is necessary,  given our assessment  of the trend ofpotential,  if we are  to avoid a further intensification  of pressures  in analready taut labor market.Unfortunately,  our near-term  growth  forecast hinges crucially  on ajudgment  about the outlook for inventories--a very  tricky element to predict.In a nutshell, we find  it difficult  to believe that the pace of accumulation  inthe second quarter  was as  high as the available  statistics indicate.  But, afterdiscounting  the data as much as we feel comfortable  doing at this point, weare still left with a rate of inventory  growth that is clearly unsustainable--around  a 6 percent annual rate.  We don't think there  were major overhangsof undesired  stocks at midyear,  but there  will be if the accumulation  doesn'tslow soon.  Our guess  is that it will, exerting  an appreciable  dampinginfluence on  GDP growth in the  second half of this year.What could go wrong with this forecast?  The possibilities  arenumerous.  One is that the rate of accumulation could  have been even lowerthan we have  assumed, so that the near-term drag on output might thereforebe less than we are  anticipating.  It's my intuition that this should be viewedas  the more likely alternative  to our Greenbook forecast than that inventoryinvestment  has been greater than we have  assumed.8/19/97But what if we have  the rate of inventory investment in  the secondquarter just right?  The possibility would still exist that businesses will wantto  maintain that brisk pace of accumulation  a  little longer because  they  arehighly  optimistic about sales prospects.  However, I don't sense such  adegree  of optimism  now;  nor am I  as concerned  as  I was earlier that  finaldemand  might seriously  overshoot  our forecast,  in turn generating  additionalinventory requirements.In particular, we have  been  noting for some time the risk that consumerdemand  might yet surge in response  to the enormous  run-up  in stock marketwealth.  Now that the national income  accounts  show the personal  savingrate  declining considerably  over the past couple  of years, the  likelihood ofsuch a spending  surge would  seem to have  diminished.  Moreover,  for whatit is worth  as we look ahead,  the flip side  of this argument is that we canperhaps  also be somewhat  more confident  that there will indeed be somedemand-damping effect if the stock market  drops, as we  are still predicting  itwill.  The wavering  of the market recently  might suggest  we are on the righttrack in  that regard,  but we have been wrong before.There are uncertainties  regarding other components  of final demand aswell, but I think our forecast  is reasonably balanced overall.  I won't take  thetime to run through  all the  sectors of demand,  but Ted and I will be happy toanswer  any questions you might have.Before concluding,  however, I would like to say a few words  about theprice outlook.  We continue to believe  that a pickup in inflation  is brewingout there in a very tight labor market, but it clearly  has not surfaced  yet.  Asyou undoubtedly noticed,  we  have lowered  our forecast  of price inflationagain--this  time by a  couple  of tenths  of a percent through  next year.The incoming wage  and price indexes  provided  only a bit  of themotivation for this adjustment:  The ECI for June  and the CPIs for June  andwe  saw other grounds  as well for some greater  optimism  about the priceoutlook.Notably,  while we think the recent run-up in the dollar is unlikely tohold up permanently,  it seems prudent to anticipate  only a gradual erosion  inits value over the  forecast period.  Consequently,  we have anticipated  a tadmore restraint  on inflation coming  through the trade  sector in comingquarters.  Certainly, the auto market is demonstrating  the efficacy  of importcompetition  as an inflation  fighter, as the Big Three  have cut prices  to saveIn  addition,  however, the prospects  of competitive pressures  dampinginflation  seem greater now because the inventory  adjustment is likely  to8/19/97contribute  to some slippage in the level of factory capacity utilization.Moreover, the revised NIPA data suggest that profits have been muchstronger and that corporations  have more cushion to absorb  some increase  inlabor costs.  Finally, there has been  increasing  evidence of a gradualdowndrift in inflation  expectations  among individuals,  for example in theMichigan  SRC survey, which  bodes well for the nominal  wage outlook.Speaking of wages,  in refining our inflation  forecast,  we  obviously  didnot give much weight to a concern  that surfaced  occasionally last  week whencommentators  were  looking for excuses  for the stock  market decline--namely,  that the UPS strike might signal  a major shift in the balance  ofpower in the labor market, with workers now being  able to dictate the termsand conditions  of employment.  In particular,  there was  a fear that theoutcome  would be an erosion  of firms'  ability to use part-time  andcontingent workers  at lower cost.  What we have heard of the settlement doessuggest that the Teamsters  won some significant pay gains for part-timersand  10,000 promised conversions of part-time jobs to  full-time  over the nextfive years.  But, pending  receipt of more information about the  agreement, itis far from obvious  that what has  happened would warrant a change  in ourforecast of only a gradual acceleration  of labor costs.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The information  that I heard on the radio this morning onthe  UPS  agreement may  or may not be correct, but it suggested  wage increases  of 5  or 6 percent.Since the firms that  compete with UPS  are,  to my understanding,  all non-union, is there apossibility  that the wage cost change could result in a competitive  situation for UPS that wouldsignificantly  erode its very  large market share of this industry  and in a sense undercut what appearsto be, at least on the immediate surface,  a victory for the union?  Is there  any evidence  that supportsor refutes that proposition?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't think we know  enough to answer  that question  at this point.  Itdoes appear that the gains  for full-time UPS workers  may not be  spectacular in terms of hourlywages.  I don't have  a very  good fix on what the part-time workers received.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I heard $4 an hour  over 5  years on an $11  base.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I saw those figures  and I'm not sure to whom they apply or whether thereference  is to the minimum wage  or some  other measure.8/19/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  think it applies  to the  average  wage.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  In that case,  it would seem that  there  have been  some significant gains.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It is interesting that the  head of the Teamsters  Union  wasacknowledging  that there  would be job losses.  The implication was  that UPS will convert  20,000part-time jobs into  10,000 full-time jobs.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The company  has been  saying that they probably  would lose  some marketshare, at least for a time, because many  firms would no longer want to rely solely on  UPS.  Thisstrike is going to be a fundamental  problem for them, at  least until they can rebuild confidenceamong their customers.  I  have not heard the assertion that they would be priced out of the marketby the  wage  agreement,  but it was not known what the wage agreement  would be when peoplewere making  these pronouncements.  The company  evidently has indicated,  and as you said theunion  has confirmed, that  there probably  will be some layoffs.  So, the situation is  ambiguous.  Idon't know  how much erosion of market share one might expect  simply on the  basis of the costfactor.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  This is a labor intensive activity is it not?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  At least at the distribution  centers.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  To  a considerable  extent,  yes, but there is  also a lot of capital  investmentinvolved, particularly  in the rapidly  growing  area of second-day  service  that UPS  has developed.That  is part  of the story behind the changing employment mix.  In order to implement this rapiddelivery service, they needed to have a lot of people in concentrated  periods  to shuffle  all the boxesand get them loaded onto airplanes.  That is where the disproportionate  rise in part-timeemployment  apparently  occurred.  So, UPS evidently  had some real problems  in accommodatingthe labor union's  desires; many of their employees  were working  two four-hour shifts with a three-8/19/97hour break.  The  unions did not want to call that an eight-hour day.  I do not know how theseworking-condition  aspects  of the negotiations  were resolved.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  a directly related  development,  atleast in the New  York area,  has been the reaction  of UPS competitors.  When some  shippers  askedthose competitors  to provide a delivery  capability,  rather than increasing  prices the competing firmsasked for  a two- or three-year  agreement  to assure  the continuation  of the new business.  So, theywere going for market share rather than short-term  price increases.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  This could turn  out to be a  quite counterproductive  laborcontract for the Teamsters  if a lot of events go in the wrong direction.  They could end up with asignificant  loss of total jobs not only  as the result of the conversion  from part-time  to  full-timework, but also through a  significant  loss of market share because of the  continuity agreementssecured by UPS  competitors and because  of the effects  of higher wages  on UPS pricing.  So, afterthe significant  glow that the union  is putting on the  settlement, things could turn in the otherdirection  and be most unhelpful  for the union as  far as  I can  see.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Unless their negotiating  success  leads to greater organizing  success insome of the non-union  companies.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  One would assume  that to be the result unless thereemerges  a perception  that works  against the union organizers  and reduces their ability to unionizemore companies.  It is in part a question  of timing as far I am  able to tell.  President Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mike, I wanted to ask you a question  about inflation  forecasts that in theview of some have become particularly  unreliable recently.  We did an exercise--an  out-of-sampleforecast--that  looked  at the  inflation forecast  in our model.  As  one would have expected, it turnedout that we were overestimating  inflation,  but the overestimate  did not exceed the 90 percent8/19/97confidence  level.  If we  look back to, say,  1994-95  the errors actually  were  greater then and in theother direction.  There were  times, one in particular,  when the 90 percent  confidence level wasexceeded  in the  sense that  inflation was so much understated.  My  question is  whether youconclude in terms of your model that  that relationship  has broken  down, or do  you find in astatistical  sense that you cannot state that conclusion?  We feel we cannot.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I do  not think, given the standard errors  across  most models, that onewould say that the price equations have  uniformly broken  down.  And I emphasize "equations."We tend to look at an array of models in our forecast  work.  Some perform  better than others.  Notsurprisingly, the  inclusion  of import prices  as  one of the variables  in the  Phillips curve modelwould have  produced much better results in  the last  year or so in terms of anticipating theWe would use them cautiously,  though, as we always have,  knowing that they are  not very precisepredictors  in any given period.  As a practical  matter, we have not found an  alternative  to thesemodels that  we can turn to in our effort to come to grips  with the problems  involved  in constructingquantitative  forecasts.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  It strikes me as  interesting that if we wanted to  make a point that  we arein some new era, we would not use these  equations to support that conclusion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERN.  Mike, I understand  that you are assuming  a significant  decline in equityvalues next year.  How important is that to your view of how things  are going to transpire?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  As  we emphasized,  applying the normal lags that we  found in estimatingconsumption functions with wealth terms, the time profile and dimension of the stock marketmovement that we have assumed  suggest that we  would not get much of a retardation  in consumer8/19/97spending from that drop  in stock prices  before  the end of 1998.  If we contrast  this  outcome  to acounterfactual  one where  the market continued  to climb at anything like the  rate  we've  seen onaverage  over the past couple of years,  I suspect that we would have a considerably  differentconsumption  forecast for the  latter part  of 1998.  Unless  there is a significantly  quicker effecttransmitted  through consumer sentiment  in some  way, which  at the fringes  is allowed  for in ourthinking, I think  the story mainly is how robustly the economy will  be moving  in  1999.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mike,  I want to ask you about spending  for durable equipment,particularly  for technologically  oriented durable  equipment.  The Greenbook  says  that this sectorhas become  less cyclical,  and I have two questions  about this.  One,  I assume  you mean it hasbecome  less cyclical  since  the last recession.  And,  second, I was  wondering  what the implicationsare  for overall  durable  equipment  spending.  Does the  growth of this  category  mean that durableequipment  spending is becoming less cyclical  more generally?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't want to  convey the notion--and  I hope  we didn't state  it quite thatway--that  we believe  the durable equipment  sector is systematically  less cyclical  than it might havebeen in the past.  Our assessment  at this juncture  is that there seem  to be in train  some changes intechnology  of a dimension  such that the demand  for those  products will  outweigh whatever  dragthere will be from the general  flattening of profits  and cash flow  and the deceleration  in output.  Wewould not see the same  kind of impetus  in some  other areas of capital spending such as basicindustrial equipment.  So,  we have a continuation  of quite rapid  growth  in real  computer outlaysand fairly substantial  growth  in telecommunications  equipment  expenditures  as measured  by thenational  income  accounts.  The effects  of this, as  I think we noted in a footnote  in the Greenbook,on the growth in spending for overall producers'  durable equipment  are  invisible in this  forecast8/19/97relative  to the previous forecast because  of the chain  weighting.  This means that the weightsdiminish as  the prices  of these goods  fall rapidly and this balances  out the higher real  growth thatwe anticipate for this component.  But at this  point we see very substantial  reductions  over the nearterm in the  cost of various components  of computers and very strong continuing  demands  forequipment  in the  networking area.  There seems to be enough  innovation  going  on here that peopleare  going to find that  their equipment is becoming  obsolescent, and  they are  going to be replacing itat a relatively  fast rate for a while longer.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  You noted the  dependence  of your forecast  on the assumption  aboutinventories.  Is there any way  of knowing how much of this inventory  accumulation  is domesticallyproduced versus  imports?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  saw considerable  strength  in imports  in the second  quarter in a numberof categories  in the  consumer goods  and machinery  areas,  and that suggests that imports may havecontributed to the  very substantial  increase  in inventories  in that period.  As we  look to the thirdquarter, we anticipate  that  some of the fallout in inventory accumulation  will be mirrored in a moremodest increase in imports in the merchandise  category.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We do estimate  a synthetic  split in inventories  betweendomestic  and imports.  My recollection,  and I may be wrong on  this, is that the inventoryaccumulation  that occurred  in the second quarter was predominantly  in domestically producedgoods.estimates.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I don't recall whether there  was any significant change in trends in those8/19/97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I don't  think it was a trend;  I think it was a  second-quarterdevelopment.  I will check on  this and report on it when I get the  information.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  We  do not yet have the June trade data.  Taking the inventory  data togive  us a hint about what is going to happen to the trade data, one would expect imports to tail off.That would occur especially in the consumer area because we saw such  a big rise in imports ofconsumer goods in April and  May.  Understanding  all  of this is  a bit puzzling.  Our forecast tendedto level off such imports  in June  and into the third quarter, but there  is a tension in the  forecast as  awhole on exactly this point  and how this should be put together.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  There is, of course, a lot of noise  in the  data when wemove  from the  trade account  to inventories.

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  There  has been some  shift in the  seasonal  factors over the years and  tosome extent  earlier this year, especially in the consumer  goods  area.  One would not expectChristmas  to come in  April, if I may put it that  way.  It is not clear  to what extent  the seasonaladjustments  may have become  unreliable,  but it would not be a surprise if the seasonal  adjustmentof imports were another  source of the noise in these  estimates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions for Mike?  If not, who would  like tostart the Committee discussion?

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mr. Chairman, the Eleventh  District  economy, like the nationaleconomy, has been exceptional.  I guess most of you  saw the  notice from the Shadow Open MarketCommittee.  For the first time since  1974, they are going to skip a meeting,  and the reason  theygave was that policy and  the results of policy have been  so good that there was nothing for them totalk about.8/19/97In our District, there is not much new  to report.  We continue  to have faster employmentgrowth than the nation.  Since the beginning of 1995,  if we use January  1995  as the  base, EleventhDistrict growth is  second only to that  of the Twelfth District.  The fall in  energy prices that we havehad  in our neck of the woods  has not been  a problem;  it was anticipated.  Drilling is beingconstrained  by an  18-month backlog  in deliveries  of drilling pipe;  energy firms  cannot get  enoughpipe to do the amount  of drilling that they would like.  Our labor markets remain tight, and the jobchurning  seems to have picked up.  It may seem tighter to me because  our Bank has beenexperiencing  some  of the turnover.  We  have lost several  key professional  people recently toexpanding firms in the Dallas  area.  But  surveys indicate that workers  are  being found somewhere,and there is no inordinate  upward pressure  on wages,  at least in the  statistics, even  thoughanecdotally  we hear  a lot of stories.  I would not be surprised under these conditions  of prolongedlabor market tightness  to see  our labor force participation  rates hit new  highs soon.Prices  appear to be constrained.  House price  inflation in our area is about a third of whatit is in the nation.  Computer chip prices have  fallen more  than the  high-tech firms had expected,and recent attempts  to raise petrochemical  prices have  failed.  An exception  to this  price picture  inour area is commercial  real estate.  Office rents in Dallas rose 9 percent  in the first half of the year,and prices  for Dallas office buildings are up about 50 percent from a year ago.  Warehouse  pricesare up about 40 percent,  but there is  a lot of building  going  on to provide new  supply.  So, we donot expect those  kinds of numbers  to last all that long.Turning  to the national  economy,  as everybody knows, the  string of consecutive  PPIdomestic purchases  in the second quarter is the  smallest  since  1961.  The core  CPI increase  at a rateof 2.4 percent in the first 7 months  of this year is the lowest  since  1965.  The 4.8 percent8/19/97unemployment  rate is  a 24-year low, and  some measures  of consumer confidence  are at about  theirhighest level since  1952.  Now that the  UPS  strike is apparently  over, there is nothing obvious  onthe horizon to spoil the party,  although I suspect  we will find that the  strike has done a  good deal ofdamage in the past couple  of weeks.  The settlement may go a long way toward undermining  thewage  flexibility that  we started to get in  labor markets  with the air traffic controllers'  strike back  inthe early  1980s.  Even before this strike, it appeared  that the  secular decline  in real wages  was over,although productivity  gains appeared  to be  sufficient to keep unit labor costs under good control.To summarize  my views,  I would  say that I consider myself a new  paradigm optimist.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  the New England economy--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  You have to label  yourself before  you  go on.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Oh, okay.  I have to think  about that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Peter has set up a little box for each  of us.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I hate to call myself old anything.  [Laughter]  I think I'll wait on that.The New England  economy continues to expand steadily.  Employment  growth  isroughly the same as that for the nation,  and it is above New  England's long-term  trend.Massachusetts  is  a star performer,  while Rhode  Island lags behind.  The retail  sector in NewEngland is experiencing fierce  competition  in addition  to somewhat  slower growth  overall than thenation.  All  our retail contacts  think that the New England  economy is quite strong.  However, in anumber of cases,  their own results do not reflect this.  In contrast, the manufacturing  sector is doingquite well.  Although increases  in  employment are minuscule,  they are there.  Employment  inmanufacturing  increased  over the past year for the  first time in  a long time.  I assume  that a lot ofthis is due to the Boeing merger with McDonnell  Douglas and  the demand for aircraft  worldwide.8/19/97The demand  for aircraft engines  that are produced  in the First District, at least  in part,  and foraircraft parts is  quite strong.  We also have  a local auto-related  manufacturing industry, anddemand  among the firms  in that industry varies depending on which  auto company  is beingsupplied.  Suppliers to Chrysler reflect  a mixed picture, and reduced production  of the  Taurusmodel  has affected  suppliers to Ford.  On the other hand,  a fabricated  metals company  reportsfantastic business because General  Motors is using its product.The regional  unemployment  rate  was 4.2 percent in July, and that rate puts  our regionback,  after several months,  below the national  average.  A number of firms  are responding  to thetight labor markets  with targeted  compensation  schemes.  We see  a lot of reports  of individualworkers'  salaries  going  up by 20 to 25  percent,  but these salary  increases  are being applied  soselectively that the overall  rise in compensation  packages  amounts  to a  small fraction of totalpayroll,  somewhere  between  2 and 3  percent.  Some firms also  are using signing  bonuses to attractworkers.  In  general, firms  seem to be contending  successfully  with these  tight labor markets,although one of the Bank's directors recently noted that  turnover had increased  so much thattraining  costs  had become an issue.  While both the  unemployment  rate and the anecdotal  evidenceindicate  that labor markets are tight, help-wanted  advertising  in the region remains  very low,suggesting that employers  may not be using traditional  means  to attract workers.Firms continue  to view increasing their prices  as  an impossibility.  One person,  who mayhave been  talking to  Peter, said in  commenting  on customers'  resistance  to higher prices  that "theparadigm  has changed."  Despite their inability  to raise  prices,  a number of firms  indicated thatOne is the rates for Boston hotel  rooms that  have risen  12  percent in  1997 in response to a banneryear for tourism.  Another exception  involves  commercial real estate in a number of cities  in the8/19/97region.  The Boston real  estate market  has been described,  as I have  mentioned before,  as  being ashot as a firecracker  and as one  of the three or four best real  estate markets  in the country.  Theoffice  market is especially  strong, with rents  up  10 percent  in the past year  and even industrial  rentsare  rising.  Other cities  are  seeing a less dramatic  improvement.  Hartford  still lags behind but isstarting  to appeal  to some  investors because  its space is so cheap.The Conference  Board's index  of consumer  confidence  provides  an interestingperspective on  the regional  economy.  The index  increased  slightly in July  from a fairly  high June.However,  the assessment of current  conditions  soared while future  expectations  plunged to levelsnot seen in two or three years.  There may be a sense  in New  England that things really  are  toogood to last.On the national  scene as  well, trends have  been  almost unbelievably  good.  We, like theGreenbook, have  begun to question  our assessment  of capacity measures,  especially  in laborwe believe there certainly  is the potential for the economy  to be stronger  and for the rate  ofinflationary  growth  to exceed  the rather mild uptick predicted in the Greenbook.  In particular,  Ithink conditions  for residential investment  seem a bit brighter than the  Greenbook  suggests,  and wewould not predict  that net exports will  have  as benign  an effect on prices  due both to dollardepreciation  and  our somewhat stronger  assessment of foreign  inflation  prospects.  On the whole,however,  we have no major differences  with the Greenbook.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR.  MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our regional  economy  continues  toexpand  at  a modest rate, though  growth  in the District seems to be slower than that for the nationdue in part to labor supply constraints.  As  I have been reporting  for some  time, our labor markets8/19/97are  very tight, with lower unemployment  rates  and higher employment-to-population  ratios than thenation's.  In fact, last year the employment-to-population  ratio for our five states averaged 3percentage  points  above the nation's 63.2 percent,  and over 70 percent of the working agepopulation  was employed in Iowa and Wisconsin.  Nonetheless,  the employment  cost index for theMidwest  has not risen  appreciably faster than the nation's, although we have  received numerousanecdotal  reports of intensifying  wage pressures  for entry-level  and certain  skilled workers.  NextMonday,  August 25,  Manpower  will release its  latest  survey on hiring  intentions,  so thisinformation  should be  treated as confidential  until then.  The survey indicates  that the demand forworkers continues to be very  strong.  In fact, the results  show the highest fourth-quarter  hiringintentions since  1978, both nationally  and in the Midwest.Manufacturing  activity in the District continues to expand  at a slower pace than in thenation.  Strong activity  continues to be reported in industries such  as cement,  gypsum board,medium- and heavy-duty  trucks,  agricultural  and other heavy equipment,  and  steel.  However,  thereare  a few hints that business is  slowing in some industries, though all of my contacts believe thatthe slowing  is temporary.  For example, noted  that for the first time in severalyears  there was some softening  in demand  at his  firm's steel distribution  subsidiary  that caters tosmall manufacturers.  Another contact reported  slower growth in orders  for a variety of productsincluding food equipment for restaurants,  hotels,  and supermarkets  as well as for decorativeceramic  tiles in the construction industry. in the trucking  industry  describedactivity  as slower than normal  for this time of year, but he said his customers expect business toimprove  significantly in the fall.Manufacturers  and retailers in our District  continue to report that competitive  pressuresinhibit their ability to  raise prices.  One report to the contrary  relates to our discussion at the last8/19/97meeting when  I indicated  that a large paper company was reducing capacity by temporarily  closingtwo plants.  In July,  that company pushed through  its first price increase  since  1995,  which otherfirms in the industry followed in August.  The firm referred  to this increase  as "price  restoration,"and it emphasized  that the increase  still left prices 30 percent below  their peak in  1995.In terms of consumer  spending trends, retailers  indicated  that sales over the past monthor so were generally  at or slightly above  expectations, helped in part by more seasonable  weatherand the use of promotions  in some cases.  Incentives  apparently also  contributed to  the sizablepickup in auto  and light truck sales  last month.  Reports  suggest that light vehicle sales  got off to  agood  start in August,  although probably not as strong as in July.  Part of the recent sales  strengthdealers  are now targeted to slow-selling  models rather than across  the board, and they were  initiatedin July of this year rather than  October, which  had been  GM's traditional policy.Turning to the national  outlook, our forecasts  of real growth  and inflation have  bothcome down  a bit since  our last meeting.  However,  the big question  is still whether we will  see theincrease in  inflation that most of us are forecasting  for  1998.  Labor market conditions  suggest thatwe may.  Of course, labor  markets have been tight for some years  now without a major pickup  inlabor costs or inflation, but they have become even tighter in the past few quarters.  Moreover, thefundamentals  appear  to be in place  for continuing real  growth  at trend rates at least.  Consequently,the labor markets  should remain  tight for the foreseeable  future.  Fortunately, we have had a  greatdeal  of investment in recent  years, and  the resulting  increase in productive  capacity should at leastlessen  inflationary pressures.  We may also  be entering  an era of significantly  faster productivitygrowth;  I guess that is part of the new paradigm.  But the most recent  official statistics  do notprovide much evidence of this.  Moreover, even if the  data become  more favorable,  it will take8/19/97quite  some time before  we know  with any certainty whether the economy has changed  in such afundamental  way.  Thus, given our current  understanding  of the economy's  growth potential,  themost reasonable  forecast is  one of rising inflation.  Of course, the upward tilt to the  inflationforecast is relatively  modest, but in my view the risks are still  clearly on the upside.

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  the Twelfth  District's rapid economic  expansion hasactually gained  momentum in recent months.  Payroll  employment  grew by 3.2 percent at an  annualrate in the second  quarter.  Growth in durable manufacturing  employment  accelerated  between thefirst and second quarters  as Boeing's expansion combined with the continued  strength in  high-techindustries and a recent resurgence in wood products industries.  Construction  employment growthalso  accelerated in the second quarter.  Districtwide, this sector expanded  nearly 9 percent  on anannual  basis during the first half of the year.  I might note parenthetically  that in  the last yearconstruction increased 9.2 percent  in California, generating  more than 46,000 jobs, and  14.9percent in Nevada.  Normally,  I would say that  a percentage  increase that large  is unsustainable,  butwhen I discuss  the Nevada  economy,  I do not use the word "unsustainable."The second-quarter  acceleration  was  evident in most District states.  Payroll employmentin each of the District's  growth leaders--Nevada,  Arizona, Utah, Washington,  and Oregon--grew  by4 percent or more  at an  annual pace.  Furthermore,  the unemployment rate  has fallen this year in allDistrict states except  Hawaii,  and labor markets in virtually  all major urban  areas  are  extremelytight.The impressive  turnaround in California's  economy has continued this year;  payrollemployment  grew  nearly  3 percent at an  annual rate during  the first seven  months of the  year.Although  the pace  slowed in recent months,  the state's unemployment  rate continued  to fall.  Other8/19/97California economic  data also point to a continued rapid expansion.  Unexpectedly  strong growth instate income  tax receipts recently led to  a substantial  upward revision in  state  government revenues.Also, the  recovery  in residential  real  estate  markets has spread to most areas of the state,  andhousing prices  statewide  are back on the rise.Turning to the national economy,  recent  data suggest that over the next year or so,  real GDPis likely to grow at a rate close to the 2-1/4  percent pace  now reported  for the second quarter.  Likethe Greenbook,  I think underlying  demand may be somewhat  stronger than this in the near term,but firms are  likely to satisfy part of the  demand  out of inventories.  While the economy  is notlikely to grow  much faster  than its trend rate over this period, conventional  measures,  as we allknow, suggest that it is already  operating at relatively  high levels  of resource utilization.  Thus,there is still  a risk that inflation may trend upward in the future.  Of course, recent data on wagesand prices  have been  highly favorable  and  now actually  show a modest downward  trend.  Whilepart of this can be explained  by factors  such as the higher  dollar, part remains  unexplained  byconventional  relationships.  Is inflation being  held down by temporary  factors  such as unusuallysmall increases  in benefit  costs or higher worker  insecurity or is  the change of a more permanentnature because it reflects  developments  such as an  increase in trend productivity?  Taking thesefactors into account,  my best judgment is that, while remaining low, underlying  inflation is likely topick up a little over the next six quarters.  For instance,  our forecast  shows measures  of coreinflation  going up between 1/4 to 1/2  percentage point between  this year and next.  Finally,  I wouldclassify myself as  an old paradigm,  newly found optimist.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  far as our District goes, not a great  dealhas changed  since our last meeting, so I will summarize  developments  and highlight a couple of8/19/97them for you.  Generally,  we have  a robust  economy that is growing  modestly;  we have  strongproduction and  increased sales  overseas.  Our manufacturing  sector is operating  at high levels ofcapacity,  including the  airline industry  with Boeing and the  auto industry  with GM  and Ford.  Theenergy companies are  continuing  to expand  in the  District  and are experiencing  some productionbackups  because of supply constraints.  Bank  lending picked up in July, with banking  contactsreporting  a fair amount of activity.  With regard to the  agricultural  sector, you may have read aboutour excellent  wheat crop.  Kansas  will  have a record  harvest of just under  500 million bushels,  andthat comes  after  a spring  forecast  of a decline in production.  There is some  pressure on the  corncrop  and current  estimates  are coming in a little lower  than earlier forecasts.  How  that will turn  outremains  to be seen.One  of the topics  about which we have talked  a lot at these  meetings  is the cost  ofworker benefits.  We had interesting conversations  with an executive  of Theyare estimating  that premiums  probably will  increase by 3 to 8 percent in  1998, partly  becausecapacity is  being wrung out of the system  and demand  continues to increase.We  are  seeing some  indications of moderating  growth in our District.  Our employmentgrowth has  fallen over  the last two months for which we have  data, the last one being June.  We donot know  if that slowing is partly due to the fact that we have  such low unemployment  rates tobegin with.  The rate is 2 percent in Nebraska and  around 4 percent in  some  areas that areexperiencing our worst unemployment.  Also, manufacturers  are  saying that while their productionis still expanding,  the  growth  is moderating.  Some of them are rethinking  their projections  and areforecasting more modest  growth going forward.  In construction, we have  seen  some moderation inour region, especially in housing.  The latter is concentrated  in the mountain  areas around  Denverand Albuquerque,  and it may be in part the  result of a slowdown in in-migration.  However,  the8/19/97moderation in those areas  is being offset  to some extent by pickups in the eastern  parts of theDistrict.  Overall,  District business activity is good, but there  are  some mixed  signals and slowingin some areas.On  the national  front,  our projections  of GDP and  inflation are similar to the projectionspresented  here by the  staff.  We do not have  any real  disagreements.  We currently  see the economyexpanding  at a pace  a bit over potential,  with only slight increases  in inflation.  I will  end with that,Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic picture  and outlook for theSoutheast also have  not changed  very much over the  last seven weeks.  We  still have a veryfavorable  and balanced  picture, mirroring  and reinforcing what we see  at the national level.  TheSoutheast is still  "humming  along,"  Mike.Picking  up on Cathy Minehan's  comments on tourism, our region's hospitality  andtourist industry, which  offers some insight into discretionary  spending,  is operating at or nearcapacity in most of our major  tourist cities.  Future bookings  are  well ahead  of a year ago.  Evenwith the new capacity that has come on line--and  more is coming--hotels  are offering  fewer off-season discounts,  and there is no noticeable  impact on  occupancy rates.  Cruise ships and  airlineflights in South  Florida are essentially fully booked, so if anyone  is planning  a speech in  SouthFlorida, make your reservations  early!We,  too, see continuing evidence  of some  slowing in residential  construction  activity, butone must look beyond very high levels of activity in cities  like Atlanta.  Expansion  of constructionactivity in  the commercial  sector, mostly office buildings and hotels, is taking up some  of the slack.8/19/97But even with  speculative  prices  still holding up, leasing  activity has  slowed somewhat  in thosesectors  and we expect  announcements  of new  projects to moderate  in the period  ahead.Manufacturing  activity  is more  difficult to read,  but it appears  to have recovered  a littlesince the last meeting.  While our latest  regional  manufacturing  survey showed  that currentproduction  had eased slightly, shipments,  new orders,  back orders, employment,  and the workweekall rose in the  last report.  Also,  picking up on Bob McTeer's  comments,  oil  and gas activitycontinues  to be  strong in Louisiana and  along the  Gulf Coast, with  the number  of working rigsremaining high.  Orders for new  ship construction  are booked  several  years  out.Labor markets  in our region also remain  tight, an old and familiar story by  now.  Pocketsof special  tightness  include information  technology  and  skilled crafts  in  areas  like marine  and oil-related work.  At the same time,  we still cannot  find any  evidence  of a systematic  run-up in  wages,and wage increases  reportedly  are continuing  to hold below  the 4 percent  level.  In fact,in the  paper industry told  me last week that his company is continuing  to get concessionsfrom its unions to protect jobs at lower productivity plants.  Employers  are telling us that they arenot spending significantly  more  to pay workers  but are  spending considerably  more to recruit,screen,  and  train new  employees.Our  surveys have turned up no  new evidence  of unusual developments  in prices.  Whileour latest manufacturing  survey indicated that prices received  increased moderately,  75 percent  ofthe respondents  in that survey  expected no  change in the period  ahead.  Prices paid eased slightly,with 70 percent reporting  no change.  Consistent  with Tom Hoenig's  comments,  we too hear withgreater  frequency  reports  of sharper increases  in health care costs.One area of special  concern  in our region  is the Florida citrus industry where  growers arebattling the  medfly for the first time in many years.  While current estimates  of damage  are only  in8/19/97the $20 to $26 million range, those  estimates  are doubling  every couple of weeks,  and  we aremindful  of the  last experience in  California where  losses hit some $200 million.  So, we  could seesome run-up in fruit  prices late in the year.Our view on the national  picture  is very similar to  that laid  out in the  Greenbook anddiscussed  by Mike Prell  this morning.  We,  too, expect a  slower second half of 1997,  with GDPgrowth  at perhaps  2-1/4 percent  and a similar pace  in  1998.  We also think it likely  that we will losesome ground  on inflation over the coming period.  My  feeling is that we need to remain  vigilant,and with the risks still skewed  somewhat to the  high side  an anticipatory  anti-inflationary  policymove in the future is still quite likely.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The  central  question on the economythat we face this morning is much the  same  as the question  we faced  at the last meeting  and atearlier meetings:  Is demand  reviving as we move into the third quarter or not?  At  our Bank, wetried to analyze  the recent information  and data that we  have received  as closely as we could in  thecontext  of that question.  Our sense is that activity  did pick up fairly markedly  in our region  in Juneand July, especially  in the retail and services  sectors.  As  some of you may know,  we conduct  acouple  of monthly  surveys,  one on the manufacturing  sector and one on services  and retail.  In July,our indexes  for service-sector  employment  and  wages both posted their strongest  gains  since  westarted putting these indexes  together about four years  ago.  The results  of the latest manufacturingsurvey were less robust overall, but there  are  some indications  in that  survey of firmer wages  atplants  and factories.  Prices  for finished goods  and  manufacturing  inputs  are up about a percentagepoint from the almost negligible increases  that had been  registered  consistently for about  18  monthsor so before this.  Overall,  we do not see  any signs  of significant  weakness in our regional8/19/97economy;  even West  Virginia is doing well.  On  the contrary, we are  impressed  by the basicallyacross-the-board  indications  of stronger activity  and at least some modest upward pressure  on bothwages  and prices.On the national  picture, the Greenbook  projection is certainly reasonable.  Like a numberof others around  the table, we  still think that the  risk of error in the projection is moderately  tilted tothe upside.  The major reports that we have  received  since early July--the jobs report, thePurchasing  Managers'  Survey, the reports  on retail  sales and automobile  sales--all  suggest,  at leastto  me, that  the economy  is poised to put some additional upward pressure  on our labor resources.I was especially interested  and happy to see that this month's Greenbook  and Bluebookboth included  for the first  time charts  comparing  the regular  10-year  Treasury rate with  the rate onthe new  inflation-indexed  note.  The first page  of the Bluebook  interprets  the  gap between  the twoyields  as  a reflection of longer-term  inflation  expectations.  I hope the staff will  continue to providethat information.  As we gain more experience  with it, I think it will  be useful in both our economicanalysis  and our policy analysis.  As many of you know, it has been used by the Bank of Englandand  included in their inflation  report for some time with good results.A couple of quick observations  on the behavior  of this indicator in  recent weeks:  I thinkthere is both good news and bad news,  or at least not-so-good  news.  The good news is that thecurrent gap indicates  an expected trend CPI inflation  rate of about 2-3/4 percent.  If we subtract the1 percent Boskin Commission  bias from that, the true expected  trend rate of inflation  is somewherebelow 2 percent.  That is very nice,  and I will eat  a little crow and say that a year or so ago I wouldnot have expected  this result.  That kind of inflation expectation  is close  to what  I think we need  tohave to be  able to say that inflation expectations  are  no longer a major factor in business  andhousehold economic  decisions,  which has been our working  definition of price  stability for some8/19/97time now.  I do not want  to understate  this outcome; it is  good news  even for inflation hawks  likeme.The bad news,  or the not-so-good news,  is that this  indicator has been  very volatilerecently.  It was at about  3 percent  in early June and  fell to about 2-3/8 percent in late July, but itrecently  has risen again to about 2-3/4  percent in the wake of stronger-than-anticipated  economicreports.  To me that kind of sharp,  short-run reaction  of inflation  expectations  to just a couple ofmonthly  economic reports indicates  that, although  we certainly  have had an encouraging  increase  inour credibility in recent months,  we  still do not have  a level  of credibility that  I would regard  asfully consistent with price  stability as we have defined  it.  Moreover,  apart from the volatility, therecent increase  in inflation  expectations  in that indicator is a signal that bears watching.  Lastmonth Bob McTeer suggested,  quite reasonably  I thought at the time, that we  are winning the waragainst inflation but having trouble accepting  our success.  I thought about that afterwards, Bob.  Itmade  a lot of sense to me  and it is obviously  a very  attractive idea.  Around July  2 8th I was  about torelax,  declare  victory, take the day off, go to  a ball  game,  and maybe even  drink a cold beer, butthen  we got these numbers  and the reaction  to them.  So, I don't think we  want to get toocomfortable  yet.As  far as  the paradigms  are  concerned, I would  characterize  myself, Mr. Chairman,  as  anold paradigm optimist because  I know that eventually we will do the  right thing, whatever  thatmight be.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Stem.

MR.  STERN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Conditions  in our District have not changedmuch in years  in the  sense that the moderate  and steady expansion that has been under waycontinues.  Employment has continued to grow and there are some  anecdotal indications that8/19/97employers  are  going to new extremes  to find workers.  Construction  activity is healthy, bothresidential  and commercial,  and certainly the  major contractors  in our District,  of whom there are aDistrict is tourism, which  is experiencing  a disappointing  season.  I don't have an explanation  forthat.  It may be partially  weather related,  but that is the one sector that jumps out as  a departurefrom a  generally healthy economy.  Wage  and price pressures  are generally  absent.  People havebeen commenting  particularly favorably  about nonlabor costs because they  are not seeing increasesin input prices.  The one exception  is in the health care area  where we have had a very competitivehealth care  industry have been  suggesting  with more force  than usual  that the  favorable trend maybe over.As far as the  national economy  is concerned,  my impression  of the Greenbook  forecast isthat  it is very  finely balanced.  It projects modest growth  and what  I would describe  as relativelylow inflation.  In my view, it would not take much to tip the economy off that  generally positivecourse one  way or another.  Abstracting from fluctuations in inventory investment over the  nextquarter or two,  my view  is that we  will see  somewhat more  growth in  the real  economy than theGreenbook  envisions and  somewhat more inflation  as  well.  But whoever  is right about that, itseems to me  that the risks in the outlook have  not changed  significantly in recent months; theycontinue  to lie on the  side  of greater inflation,  given  where we are cyclically.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The pace of economic  activity in thePhiladelphia  District is picking up somewhat in the  third quarter after moderating in the second.Labor markets  are tight, with some upward pressure  on wages.  Businesses, however, are  still8/19/97finding ways to offset higher wage costs.  Inflationary  pressures  therefore remain  muted.Manufacturers,  retailers,  and contractors are  all showing  moderate increases  in business  activity.Loan volumes are up slightly.  Firms generally  are  doing very well in maintaining  their coststructure.  All in all, my impression is that  the District economy  is growing  steadily  withoutnoticeable  excesses.  This  steady growth environment  is particularly  helpful in  alleviating  some ofthe long-standing  social problems  that one  finds  in a large northeastern  city like Philadelphia.Turning to the national  economy, there does  appear to be some  pickup in final  salesduring the  current quarter.  The amount of inventory accumulation  is uncertain  and quarter-to-quarter growth rates  are therefore uncertain  as well.  More  basically,  the economy appears  to begrowing moderately, with tight resource  usage.  Conventional  economic  models point to upwardprice pressures,  as they have for some time.  They  may be right or they may be wrong, but  in themeantime  actual  signs of an inflationary  buildup  are shadowy at best.  There still  is a strong casefor us to wait and watch.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  The Eighth District economy  is still growing at  amoderate  pace.  District firms report continued  growth in sales and employment,  although tightlabor markets throughout the  District are a limiting factor.  Average  unemployment,  at 4.4 percent,remains below the national rate.  District payroll  employment, which earlier had increased  muchfaster than nationally,  grew only  1.4 percent in the year ending in June compared  with 2.1  percentfor the  nation.  Estimates  of District automotive  production  are down  about 4-1/2 percent  for thethird quarter  and .2 percent for the fourth quarter from high levels  a year ago.  Residentialconstruction  activity also  remains below  last year's high levels,  though some bankers  have noted apickup in mortgage  demand  recently.  Commercial  and consumer  loan demands  are described  as8/19/97steady.  In agriculture,  crops  are in reasonably  good condition  despite  the hot,  dry weather that  hasprevailed in  most of the region, and an  above-average  harvest is expected  in most of the District.Regarding  the UPS strike,  concerns  have been  expressed by District  contacts  about thelong-term ramifications  of the strike for future  labor market bargaining,  including  the ongoing UPSdispute with its pilots and the Teamsters contract with less-than-truck-load  carriers,  which  expiresThe nation seems  poised for another year of above-trend  economic  growth despite thestrike and  some slowing in the second quarter.  Rising real  wages, high consumer confidence,  and  arecent surge in  consumer expenditures, especially  for housing  and big ticket items,  all suggest thatreal  GDP will  continue to grow  above trend in  the second half of 1997.  Although  labor marketshave become  extremely tight, there  is some puzzlement  as  to why the employment cost index  hasbeen  on a  downward trend.  An  alternative measure, compensation  per hour, has displayed  a moredistinct cyclical behavior,  slowing to  1.4 percent for the year ended  in the  second  quarter of 1994and rebounding to 3-1/2  percent over the last four quarters.  The compensation  per hour measurepicks  up changes  in labor costs when the composition  of the labor force changes  as well  as costincreases  due to promotions and bonuses  that can be  missed by the ECI.  We are hearing  anincreasing number of reports from  our District contacts  about the need for hiring bonuses and otherspecial compensation  arrangements to attract the talent that they require.The broad monetary  aggregates  continue  to grow at or above  the upper limits of theirranges.  M2 growth,  at an annual rate of about 5  percent and given  its recent  velocity  pattern, isroughly consistent with projected  nominal  GDP growth.  The good news  on lower inflation  in  1997is welcome, but as we  all know it is partly an  illusion.  The low CPI inflation  in  1997  reflects themoderation of energy prices after a surge in  1996.  Also, people  seem largely unaware  of the8/19/97technical BLS  adjustments that will shave  1/4 percentage  point from  the  1997 average.  If this  1/4point is  added to the last  12  months of CPI inflation,  the rate  is back around  2-3/4  percent,  which isabout the average  for CPI inflation  over the last several  years.  The continued  emphasis on the CPIless  food and energy can  be misleading in  identifying underlying  inflation  trends.  Recent  researchsuggests  that the CPI itself is actually  a better predictor of future inflation  than the ex-food-and-energy measure.  If we want to eliminate  the month-to-month  noise in  the data, rather than focusingon  the ex-food-and-energy  measures  we can simply  average  CPI inflation  over a longer period orwe can look at a measure  such as the median  CPI.  The median  CPI averaged  over three  months hasremained around  3  percent  at an  annual rate over the first seven months  of 1997,  essentially thesame pattern  as in recent  years.  I  guess the question is whether that is  good enough.  Until we canagree  on a common  yardstick, I don't know how we as a group can ever reach  agreement  as towhether we are  achieving  our objective  of price stability.  That's why I think it is so important thatwe continue  the discussion  on inflation measures  that we began  at the last meeting.Finally,  although we tend to assume  that there  is not much of a constituency  for pricestability, we should not underestimate  the cost to  our credibility  and  the potential  public backlash  ifwe permit trend inflation to rise.  In fact, we might be surprised at how much support there wouldbe for locking in the  lower inflation  we have seen this  year, in  view of how  well the economy  hasperformed under conditions  of relatively low  and stable  inflation.  Thank you.

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman,  the Second District economycontinues  to underperform  the nation's to some extent, but it has been doing somewhat better.  Theregion's labor markets  remained steady in the second quarter.  New Jersey's  unemployment  rateedged  down to 5.4 percent in July, reversing its little uptick in June, but it is down 0.7  point from a8/19/97year ago.  New  York  State's unemployment  rate  remained  fixed at 6.3  percent  for the first sixmonths  of this year.  New York City's rate  climbed to  10 percent  in June,  up from 9.6 percent  inupward trend in  labor force participation.Most major retailers  in the region  report that sales were  above plan  in July.  Compared toa year ago, same  store sales  gains for July ranged from  2 to 6 percent.  Virtually  all the retailerssurveyed report satisfactory inventory  levels,  helped in part by successful  summer clearance  sales.Our retail contacts report little  or no change  in merchandise  costs and  some deflation in  sellingprices.  Retail wage pressures  generally  remain  subdued.Residential  construction  activity retreated  modestly in the second quarter, but theregional  variations persisted,  with upstate New  York weak  and the New York  metropolitan arearelatively  strong.  The commercial  real  estate markets in  and around New  York City continued totighten  in the second quarter,  as reflected  in brisk leasing  activity  and declining office availabilityrates.  The reports from our regional  purchasing  managers  indicate some  slowing in manufacturingactivity in July,  especially in  the upstate  area  of New  York, again  the problem  part of our District.Consumer price inflation in the New  York metropolitan  area averaged 2-1/2 percent during the  12months ending in July,  up a little from the year ending in  June and just a tad above the national  rate.New  York State legislators  finally  approved the fiscal year  1998 budget.  The approval  came fourmonths later than the  deadline  under New  York State  law, a new  and not particularly enviablerecord.On the  national level,  we see  the economy rebounding in the  third quarter  and we drawsome confidence  in that forecast  from the strength  in retail  sales and in the  sales of light vehicles  in8/19/97reasonably  balanced risks to our forecast of real  economic activity,  but there  is  some downside  riskin the next few months  if the ratio of sales  to inventories,  especially  in manufactured  goods,  shouldencourage  manufacturers  to cut production back  somewhat.  That ratio is low  by historicalstandards,  but it's a bit higher than it has been in the recent past.We share  the disappointment  of many  that the recent NIPA revisions  did not demonstratea greater growth  potential for the economy.  The revisions  helped explain  the good performance  ofinflation because  of the downward  revision to unit labor costs, but  it leaves us with the largequestion of how  long the low growth rates of wages  and benefits  will continue.  There is also  aquestion  of how long the favorable  effect of a strong  dollar can continue  to be helpful  to ourinflation performance  because  of both its direct  effect  on import prices and  the discipline itprovides  to domestic  manufacturers.  So,  as regards  our inflation  forecast, we believe  that the rateof increase  in the prices  of core  goods  will remain  subdued, but we are  somewhat  more concernedabout increases  in the  prices of services  where  competition is less severe  and  more local.  We thinkit is possible  that such prices will  creep  up.  The  reason  for that is  above all because  we think theeconomy is  at present  operating about  2 percentage  points above what would appear  to be potentialGDP.  Therefore,  we have  some concern about  the possibility  of rising inflation  even though ourforecast  has the economy growing  in line with the rate of increase in its capacity.  So, we areforecasting  a rise in  inflation, but we are not terribly  certain about the timing;  the forecast  has therise taking place in the latter half of 1998 and  as we go into  1999.

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the seven  weeks since  we last met, I havebeen doing  my best to search the data and read and listen as  carefully  as I could to see if I can comeup with any  convincing information  that indicates things are beginning  to change.  Other  than8/19/97various  straws in the  wind, I just cannot find any.  There  certainly  are some  straws in the wind.  AlBroaddus  mentioned  some important ones that  would indicate  some  strengthening in economicactivity,  and others  have  as well.  But it should be  mentioned that  there also are some  straws  in thewind blowing in the other direction that would  indicate  a possible  slowing or at least not very muchacceleration  in economic  activity,  and possibly  some easing in inflationary  pressures.  The dollarhas  continued to strengthen on balance;  long-term  interest rates  have eased on balance;  the yieldcurve is flatter  and lower;  the  PPI has fallen for  seven  straight months;  inventory growth has  beentoo strong;  consumer sentiment  is still quite high but is off its  peak; gold prices--for  anyone  who isinterested--are  lower;  capacity utilization  is down  a little;  and non-oil import prices are  expected tocontinue  soft.  There are  straws  in the wind that  are swirling, I would  guess, in all directions.I have no intention whatsoever  of climbing into any of Peter Fisher's boxes,  [Laughter]but I must say that we should  be careful  about making too much fun of the so-called  new paradigmpessimists  because I don't think that  deflation is  completely impossible.  All in all, the message  tome is that  the risks are probably still moderately  to the upside,  and we should,  and will certainly,stay very alert.  But basically, it is  steady  as she goes.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I have  always been an optimist.  I think  I was  born that  way, but I findmyself stuck between the  old and the new paradigms at the moment and not helped very much bythe flow  of data.  The good features  of this economy have  been emphasized  by all of us for severalmeetings in a row.  I believe we are  now beyond the point where we  are just getting  short-run goodnews.  We have had  a solid economic  performance  for long enough  to be quite reassured in a basicsense  about the strength and competitiveness  of the U.S. economy,  and that is a good thing.  Thecontinuing tight labor markets,  without accelerating  inflation,  are  terrific.  We certainly have lots of8/19/97evidence  of the increasing  competitiveness  of U.S.  industry at home and  abroad, which isreassuring.  The fact that exports  have held up  so well in the face  of the high dollar is really a quitegood thing.  We have  had continued  and balanced  growth  across regions  and  industries.  It's gettingharder and harder to figure out with our eyes  closed who is talking around  this table because  thereports are quite  uniform.  On  top of that,  we have generally  good  news in agriculture  andcommodities,  and prospects  for growth in all our markets  abroad  should keep the favorable  exportstory going even  if the dollar fails  to reverse course.There  still seems  to be  a major mystery about what is going on, especially  aboutproductivity.  That is not helping us to decide among paradigms,  which actually,  Peter, I find youhave very usefully organized  as a set of boxes.  So, I think all of us have to conclude that the risksare more  on the high side.  I'm not so much worried  about the possibility that the economy  mayoverheat and  that we will face the  prospect of higher inflation  because  I think we know what to doabout that.  We  have a tool; it is just a question  of when to use  it.The bigger problem  for the  U.S. economy,  which was reinforced  in my mind by theHumphrey-Hawkins  experience--both  the Chairman's  and  the one I shared with Larry Meyer andBill McDonough--is  the problem of the distribution  of the gains from this very good economy.  It ishard to refute the evidence  that the  gains are  very heavily concentrated  in the top 25  percent of theincome distribution, and I  find that very worrisome.  There is  a real problem for social cohesion.There is a potential problem, at least, for economic  stability if we  get more  strikes  and labor unrest,perhaps  even as a result  of what may be perceived  as the success  of the UPS strike.  It  is a seriousproblem,  it seems  to me, for people  who talk about the economy,  including  or perhaps  especiallyrepresentatives  of the Federal Reserve.  If we talk about  all the good things that we see happeningand crow about the excellence  of the economy,  we risk sounding insensitive and out of touch with8/19/97average  people  or even  the  majority of the  population.  On  the other hand,  if we recognize  theproblem of concentration  of gains at  the top of the income  distribution,  that would lead  to thereasonable  question  regarding  what we propose to  do about  it, since we do not command the toolsthat can help.  We can talk  in general  terms  about  other kinds  of policies,  about education  andtraining, but it seems  to me that we have to be  very careful  when we talk  about this economy,  giventhe  limited tools of monetary  policy  at our disposal.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  I definitely  identify with the  old paradigm,  albeit  with  an updatedestimate  of NAIRU.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  The  first mention of NAIRU  today!

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  But I am  at  least an  old paradigm with a new NAIRU.  I recently havebecome  more  optimistic  about the near-term outlook in response  to data  indicating much largerthan expected  inventory building  in the  second quarter, continued  favorable inflation  news, and thefurther  appreciation  of the dollar.  These developments  suggest that  it is now less likely that theeconomy will  rebound to well-above-trend growth  in the  second half, and  more likely that inflationwill  remain well contained in  the near term.  I guess  that makes me,  along with Bob Parry, an  oldparadigm newly found optimist.This  more benign outlook reflects  crosscurrents  on both output growth  and inflation inthe near term, crosscurrents  that are very well captured  in the Greenbook  forecast and discussion.The  first crosscurrent  is between slowing  inventory  investment  and rebounding  demand.  While thiswas  a minor story in the  forecast at  the last meeting,  the  higher pace of second-quarter  inventoryinvestment,  especially  in light of expected  revisions  to the data, has made this a dominant  theme  of8/19/97the near-term  outlook.  As  a result,  the economy  is more likely to grow closer to trend in the  secondhalf, and therefore  there is less concern  that utilization rates will rise further.A second set of crosscurrents  affects  the inflation outlook.  I continue  to be concernedabout the risks  of higher inflation  as a result of an economy that is operating beyond its  sustainablecapacity.  The resulting upward trend  in inflation  should be reinforced for  a while to the extent thatthe  restraining effect  of favorable transitory  factors  recently in play diminish  over time.Developments  so  far this year, however,  suggest crosscurrents that  might slow this process.First, the better  than expected inflation  outcome this year, both in  terms of lower coreand especially  lower overall  inflation,  and  the modest acceleration  in compensation  per hour  willact  in the near term  to restrain  wage and price increases  going forward.  In this  case,  it is inertia thatis our friend, and the result is a  virtuous  wage/price  spiral.Second,  some of the transitory  factors  that have been restraining inflation, particularlythe effect  of the dollar on import prices,  appear to be less transitory than previously  expectedfollowing  the further  appreciation of the dollar since the last meeting.Third, the upward adjustment  of profits  in the NIPA revisions suggests  more of a cushionthat  might delay passthroughs  of any  future increases  in compensation.  While  the net effect is  stilllikely to be higher inflation  over the forecast horizon,  any increase  will begin from a slightly lowerbase,  and at least over the forecast horizon may be even  more modest than previously expected.The net effect  is the prospect of a more benign environment  going forward,  though one certainlynot without its challenges.  Looking  at the Greenbook  forecast,  it's hard not to be delighted with theprojected outcome  in  1998  unless we have become jaded by two years  of stronger-than-expectedgrowth and  lower-than-expected  inflation.8/19/97While the  near-term  outlook looks more benign,  I still  view  the risks  as  asymmetric.Consensus  forecasts for the  second half, for example,  still appear to be in the 2-1/2 to  3 percentrange, compared  to the  2-1/4 percent rate projected  in the Greenbook.  While  the slowdown  ininventories  should be  a drag in the period immediately  ahead,  I would interpret the  inventorybuilding  in the second quarter as largely  voluntary,  and therefore  a measure  of the  confidence thatbusinesses have  in the economy  going forward.  That confidence  undoubtedly reflects the  soundfundamentals  supporting demand  and is consistent  with the initial indicators of the  strength ofdemand in the third quarter.  Growth over the  second  half is therefore  more likely to be  above thanbelow trend  in my view.  As a result, it remains more likely that utilization rates will  rise furtherrather than decline,  at least for the  second half of the  year.  In addition,  even without  a further rise,prevailing utilization  rates  continue to point toward  higher inflation  over time.One of the  more intriguing  aspects of the Greenbook  forecast is the projection  ofutilization  rates.  The Greenbook projects  a nearly unchanged  unemployment rate,  but a decliningcapacity  utilization rate even after taking  account of a slowing in  the growth of investmentspending in the manufacturing  sector and  a resulting  moderation in the rate of increase in  industrialcapacity.  A decline  in the capacity utilization rate  with an unchanged  unemployment  rate  wouldfurther widen the disparity  between these two measures  of resource  utilization, already one  of theinteresting anomalies  of the  current episode.  If this divergence  is part of the explanation  for theapparent decline in NAIRU  and the surprisingly  favorable  inflation outcome, the  further wideningof this gap may further damp the responsiveness  of inflation to the already  low unemployment  rate.how the economy  will find its way back to NAIRU,  assuming  we are already  below NAIRU.  In theBlue Chip  consensus forecast, the economy slows  on its own over  1998 to  a below-trend  rate and,8/19/97as  a result,  the unemployment rate retreats  slowly toward  NAIRU, fortunately  before  inflation risesto any considerable  degree.  In this case perhaps  we can sit back  and watch.In the Greenbook  on the other hand, the  economy  grows at  trend, preserving  theprevailing utilization  rates,  and as a result, inflation rises  gradually  over  time.  This version  of thestory is  waiting for us to write the  conclusion.  The change  in the outlook since our last meetingsuggests, however,  that we may have more time to refine our forecast before we  have to pen ourconclusion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We did get  our second-quarter  slowdown,but  the signs are  now  consistent with  the continuation of the slower  growth  or the resumption  ofsomewhat above-trend  growth.  So,  it seems  to me that the  challenge  for the Committee  is to assessthe  strength  of the economy's  momentum and the related  prospects  for inflation.  The press  andother more  professional  forecasters  phrase our current  dilemma as  a dichotomy between  alengthened  or protracted business cycle  and the  so-called  new age,  new era, or new paradigmeconomy  characterized  by enhanced but unmeasured  productivity  improvement,  deepened  capitalcapacity,  and  less proclivity  for inflation.  The  truth is probably  somewhere  in the middle.  That is,while  there probably are  technology-driven  productivity improvements  at least in some  sectors,  it ishard to believe  that business  cycles have been  exterminated.At this point, there  is considerable  strength  in the  economy.  The labor market not onlylooks  strong but it may have  more flexibility than is implied by the current low unemployment  rate.That is, employed people  seem to be quite willing to change jobs.  Business is  getting  very creativein finding ways to attract  and train new workers  and to stretch  already taut  labor markets.  Wagepressures are  probably uneven  across  different  types of jobs  and skill levels.  This may help to8/19/97explain  the anecdotal  stories  we are getting  about the  lack of statistical  evidence  of widespreadwage pressures.  Whatever  the  outcome of this  analysis, the low unemployment  rate suggests  acontinuation  of consumption  growth.  Housing  and auto sales are  holding up  quite well  for thisstage of the expansion.Another source  of strength  is business  fixed  investment,  and I see no particular  reason  tobelieve that this sector will fade.  Profits continue to be surprisingly strong.  The capital  market  issupportive of further spending.  As  long as  aggregate  demand holds up, business  investment  andreinvestment  are justified.  It does seem  to me,  however, that there is a  confluence of events orfactors that have helped  to hold inflation  down in this  favorable  economic  environment.  First, ofcourse,  as has  already been noted, is the strong dollar.  Relative economic  weakness  in foreigncompetitor nations  is alleviating  supply pressures.  Various supply  factors in  the oil market  havekept world oil prices  down,  and this is a particular  vulnerability  for the United States  economy.There  has been good enough weather to prevent  major problems  in grain crops,  thereby allowingsome replenishment  of reserves and  avoiding run-ups  in food prices.  The recent pattern  ofconsumers taking  a breather  after a spending  spree has helped  to temper spiraling demand.Progress  on the deficit has been made somewhat easier by  a strong  economy and a favorableinterest rate  environment.If any of these factors change,  the balance  could be  tipped  in the other direction andreverse  the recent benign inflation  situation.  World demand could  heat up, creating  supplyproblems.  OPEC  could  get itself together  and push oil prices  higher.  The  stock market  could takea dive off its recent roller coaster ride.  The El Nino and  global warming could converge to wreakhavoc  on agriculture.  Labor unions, or employees  generally,  could become  more  successful  inpushing wages up  to a level  that could not be  absorbed by productivity  improvements or profit hits,8/19/97resulting in final  price  increases.  Consumers  could get so self-confident  that they  forget  to take  thatquarterly pause  that has refreshed  our economy.These  are  clearly upside risks for inflation, but none of them appears  imminent.  In theother direction,  we could  get a more ordinary inventory  cycle,  as  Mike Prell has  suggested, butnone of this is certain.  So, I believe  that for now we are left  to debate how  long a sustainableeconomic  growth trend  is sustainable.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  To  round us out, President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I want to mention only  a few  things fromthe District that relate to the national outlook  and to convey some  of my concerns  about where weare  or may be in  a few months.  On  the retail outlook  question discussed  earlier,the head of a major retail company,  said that the first half of this quarter  had beenexcellent,  with double-digit  rates of increase.  However,  he  is not yet confident  that the  strength canbe sustained.  He  said it would be mid-September  before  he would be able to begin to assess theextent of the pickup  in holiday season  ordering  and to reach  a judgment  on whether  the recentbounceback  in sales  was  anything  more than  a temporary  aberration  from the  softness in the spring.On  the question  of inventories,  his view was  that in the case of autos,  the buildup  was indomestically  produced vehicles, not imports.  However,  in the case of dry goods,  the rise reflectedimports, not  domestic  goods.  He  said that imported goods  accounted  for some  70 percent  of hiscompany's  stocks.Manufacturers  of communications  equipment reported  to us in the spring  that their saleshad been  disappointing.  More recently, however,  they  indicated that  there had been  a significantpickup  in new orders  and that their backlogs were  starting to build again.  One of our directors  saidthat the  whole high-tech sector has ramped  up sharply  after being soft  for several  months.8/19/97One area  that concerns  me,  as  it does  others around  the table, is real  estate.  With regardto farmland,  we are continuing  to  hear reports  of sudden  and sharp increases  in prices  that make nosense if we think  in terms of the  agricultural  use of that land.  The huge price increases  are  notlimited to  Kentucky  horse farms,  and that leads us to speculate  that those  increases may reflect  theanticipated  conversion of these  lands to  alternative  uses  at  some point in the future.  In any event,we are not  sure what  to make of these very  dramatic reports.We  are told  that construction  in the region  is being  constrained only by labor shortages.Contractors  simply are  not able to  get more construction  workers.  Projects  are being  delayed orthey are  being completed  much later than  anticipated,  and new bids  are  coming in  significantlyhigher than previously.  There  are still  some concerns  about  sluggish  sales  of higher-priced  homes,but reports  from most  of our metropolitan  areas  indicate that  there has  been a recent  pickup inexisting  home  sales after a very  slow spring.  That  is happening through  much  of the  region.  Oneisolated report, from is that there  has been  absolutely notraffic  in the  four months  that his house has been  on the market  in Columbus, Ohio.Bankers  tell us that vacancies  are  appearing  in shopping malls throughout  the region.The  new malls may  get the tenants,  but they  are  leaving  behind vacant stores  throughout theDistrict.  This  development  is still in its  early stages.  One banker claimed  that through  next year,we  are going to  see sharply rising  vacancies  in commercial  retail space.  Another banker  said  withregard to developers  that it is getting hard  to hold them back and they  are  getting  later and later intheir payments.  The community bankers  claim  that they  are making  fewer unsecured  loans,  butthey  say that the  regionals  and super regionals  continue to lower their credit standards.I have  a couple  of observations  about the labor markets that provide  a little differenttwist on productivity  and about what  we are  hearing and reading  concerning developments  in labor8/19/97who runs  a small  manufacturing  company that ismostly related  to the motor vehicle  industry and  does  a fair amount of exporting,  said that he cannothire the  same  skilled worker  at  the same rate as  he  could one or  two years ago.  However,  he is  notwilling  to raise  his workers'  wages,  and he  also does not feel  that he needs  to because  in a sense heis  dumbing  down his workforce.  He still pays  the same wage,  but because his business  makes useof computer-driven  machinery,  computerized  inventory control,  and computerized  scheduling he isable  to produce the  same output and continue to pay the same  wage.  He simply  has smarterequipment  coupled  with  less  skilled workers to get the  same output.  That will  not show up inproductivity.who is associated  with a company  thatemploys  several hundred  workers,  said that software  is available  to permit the flexible use  of aworkforce  with unusual  hours and that has greatly increased  their ability to tap into labor pools  thatwere  unavailable  to them previously.  Examples  cited include  housewives  and  formerly retiredpeople  who do not want 40-hour workweeks  but are  willing to work odd schedules.  The  availablesoftware  allows  the preferences  of these  people to be accommodated.  Another company  thatproduces  auto parts needs  a flexible  workforce  to meet  the just-in-time  demands  of its customers.A few years  ago, they could not have  handled  such  demands, but they are now  able to do sobecause  of the new  software.Finally,  a very large  company with  70,000 employees  worldwide  is now using verysophisticated,  multimedia  educational  software  to train their workers.  They have been able toreduce  their training costs  after several years  of dramatic  increases  in  such costs.  And at the sametime, they claim to have  increased the effectiveness  of their training by 80 percent.  Again,  this issomething that would not  show up in productivity  statistics.  There is  a question  as to how much8/19/97training  actually  occurs in  a three-hour training  session or  a three-week training  session.  Whenasked  how many students  were in their classes, the reply was three students;  the  others in  theclasses were just avoiding  work.Concerning  paradigms and the outlook  in the  Greenbook,  anytime  I hear that somethingis new,  whether  it is  an idea or a paradigm or whatever,  I usually react by thinking that what is newprobably is not true, and what is true is not new.  It was said in this room well over 25 years  agothat the  old laws of economics had  been repealed.  It was not true then and  it is not true now.  Theold laws of economics  still work.  Of course, 26  years ago last Friday the  U.S. government  tried torepeal the laws of economics,  but I hope that that will never happen again.  It may be that what  iscalled a new  paradigm simply involves  allowing  what we all accept  as  fundamental  economicforces  to operate  in a less fettered way  than previously.  That does lead to some optimism about  thesustainability  of the expansion.  With regard to the new paradigm of pessimism as  it relates  todeflation,  we certainly are not hearing any of that when it comes to asset  prices.When I looked  at the  Greenbook and listened  to  a number of people report  about apickup in economic  activity,  the words  "rebounding"  and "somewhat  stronger" were  used todescribe the near-term  outlook.  Yet, the Greenbook  has 2.6 percent  real GDP growth  in the secondquarter  and 2.3  percent  for the third quarter.  On  the surface,  that would lead  people to think thatthere is some weakening  or softening going on.  But what it says to  me is that the  growth reportedfor the second  quarter, assuming that the Commerce  Department numbers  are  correct, wasunsustainable.  The mix was  unsustainable  and, as one exceptionally  smart economist  once said,unsustainable  things have  a habit of ending.  When we look at that second  quarter with weaknesson the  consumer side, booming capital  spending--which  would suggest capacity  is increasing--adramatic  surge  in imports, and  inventory accumulation  that is extraordinary  for a second  quarter,8/19/97we have  to  conclude that  something is fundamentally  wrong.  If those quarterly  numbers  are right,those  conditions cannot be  sustained.  The Greenbook fixes  things by having everything shift theother way.  The consumer  comes back, which  I guess is what we  mean by a pickup or rebound eventhough real  GDP is projected  to slow.  There  is a dramatic negative  swing in inventory  spending,and net exports  also  make a negative contribution  in the forecast  for the third quarter.  I don't knowwhether  that is a correct  forecast  or not.  I certainly  hope so because if it isn't, our problems will bemuch, much greater.  We need an  outcome something  like the Greenbook's  third quarter  and alsoits fourth quarter or we will have missed  something  here in a very serious way.The  question in my mind, then, is  how to monitor whether  that is  occurring or not.  Apart of it, getting into the  monetary numbers,  is the  need to make sure  that the behavior  of thosenumbers  stays  rather tranquil,  including  slow growth in M2  which has been running at a rate justunder 5  percent and  some slowing  in the growth of MZM  from almost 7 percent in the  secondquarter to something under 5 percent.  The recent jump in the  growth of the monetary base  is alsoworrisome even though it reflects  only a few  weeks'  data; that growth  needs to slow.I am troubled, though, that as  we get out to September  30th, we are not going to know  agreat deal more than we do today  about the performance  of the economy.  It really  is going to bethat corrects  the problem  second quarter.  I would simply like to skip October because nearly  all thecorrections  take place  in October.  We ought to repeal October, jump from the end of Septemberinto November, and  then get it right.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think this is  an opportune time to break  for coffee.[Coffee break]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Mr. Kohn.8/19/97

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  As background  for theCommittee's decision  today, I will  begin by taking a few  minutes to discussreal  interest rates,  concentrating  on the real  federal  funds rate,  given itsoccasional  use as an index  for the  stance  of monetary policy.  In  the course ofmy discussion,  I will be referring  to the set of charts that has been  distributed;these update  selected charts from  the Financial  Indicators package. 2As  you can see from the panels  on the right side of the first chart, thereal  federal funds rate  has risen considerably  this year when  lagged  CPIinflation  is used  to proxy for expected  future inflation.  The increase is aproduct of the Committee's decision  to raise the nominal  funds rate  in Marchas  well as a decline  in inflation  expectations,  as estimated using these  proxies.One might  question whether inflation  expectations  actually  have decreased  asmuch as has measured  inflation--especially  total CPI inflation, which has beendriven importantly  by temporary  swings in energy prices  over the  last twoyears.  But qualitatively similar movements  are  also evident when real ratesare constructed by subtracting the  results  of surveys of inflation expectations.Moreover,  as you can  see by comparing  the  bottom to the top rows inthe lower panel,  the current level  of the real federal  funds rate is fairly highrelative to history--in the neighborhood  of a percentage  point above itsaverage  over the entire  sample, from  1965  to the present.  This sample periodwas chosen because  it has about the  same inflation rate at the beginning  andthe end.  This should  indicate that over this  interval the economy  experiencedabout the same  amount of excess demand pushing up  inflation and excesssupply pushing it down  so that,  on average,  output was  at its potential.Consequently, other things  equal,  the average real federal  funds rate from1965 to  1997  might be a reasonable  approximation  of the natural  orequilibrium federal  funds rate  consistent with holding  the economy atpotential  and keeping  inflation  steady.But, of course,  other things have  not been equal.  One set ofdevelopments  that probably  has been tending to shift up the equilibrium  realrate over the last 30 years has  been deregulation  and  innovation  in financialloan securitizations  and other means  of diversifying sources  of funds  haveremoved  or reduced important sources  of nonprice rationing  in credit markets.Greater reliance  on the price  of credit to  allocate scarce  saving  implies thathigher real  interest rates  are needed.Aside from such  structural changes, the  equilibrium real funds rate willdepend on cyclical  or one-time influences  on the economy  and financial2  Copies of the charts  used by Mr. Kohn are  appended  to this  transcript (Appendix  2).8/19/97and  mid-1980s by an expansive  fiscal policy, and reduced in  the early  1990sby the  so-called credit crunch.What  can we infer about equilibrium  rates  in recent years?  Note that,although the  actual  real rate  has risen to a fairly high level of late, it is nowonly a little above the range of the last few years.  Moreover, if the staff andCommittee  members  are right about  the slight pickup in the CPI next year,some  of the very  recent increases in the calculated  real rate will be reversed.Real funds rates near these elevated levels  over the last three years have notconnoted a restrictive  monetary  policy.  Instead, over this period,  robustgrowth has propelled the economy to a level that exceeds  many estimates ofits  long-run potential.  An important reason for this, as Committee  membershave pointed  out in past meetings,  is the strong demand for capital  goods.The profitability  of this investment means that higher-than-normal  real ratesprofitability has been  reflected in other financial  markets,  such as for equity,where high prices have  reduced the cost of capital and boosted  net worth,further damping  any restraint  from short-term real  rates.Moreover,  a somewhat  different  picture of financial  conditions  isportrayed by longer-term  real interest rates.  Much  of the run-up  in the realfederal  funds rate over this spring and summer apparently  has not beentransmitted  out along  the yield  curve.  The rise  in the real  funds rate  resultedimportantly  from the  drop in measured  inflation  expectations  against a fixednominal funds rate.  But nominal  longer-term  rates have  been free to decreasewith inflation expectations--and  they have done  so, leaving real yields  on theTreasury's  indexed debt fluctuating fairly narrowly.  The top panel  of the nextchart shows  other measures  of real long-term  Treasury yields.  Despite  a smallupward trend since  early  1996, these  rates remain  appreciably  below theirpeaks  of 1994-95.  The uptrend is even  more muted in private rates,  the lowerpanel, which  have been  held down by low  and narrowing  risk premiums.  Thebehavior of these premiums  is indicative of the  generally ready availability  offinancing for private borrowers, which  itself would boost required real rateson federal  funds or Treasury securities.The effects  of the flattening  yield curve and declining  risk premiums  onthe real  private bond  yield can be seen in chart  13,  which plots this yieldagainst the subsequent  year's change in inflation.  This technique,  like the useof historical  averages,  is limited by the implicit assumption that historyprovides  reliable guidance to future  developments--that the  equilibrium ratehas not shifted significantly  over the past  15  years.  And, as you  can see, thefit is not tight.  Nonetheless,  real long-term rates  in  1996 and  1997--plotted  inthe diamonds  marked 97 and 98 for the Greenbook projection  of the change ininflation for those  years--are  not elevated by this standard;  they  are certainlynot in the restrictive territory  implied by recent readings of the real  funds rate.8/19/97While not evident in domestic  credit and equity markets,  elevated realshort-term rates  may still  have some restraining effect.  For example,  theyforeign economies  and policies  likely have  been important.  Whatever thereason, the appreciation  of the  dollar should help to  hold down U.S.production and prices.  Moreover,  further increases  in real  short rates--throughpolicy tightening  action or declining  inflation  expectations  withoutcompensating  policy easing--would  put upward pressure  on real  intermediate-and long-term  rates.In sum, short-term real rates  are high, and  they have  risen recently.The current  real level  of the  funds rate may provide some  assurance  thatpolicy is not highly  stimulative.  But, in the absence  of policy action, the  realfunds rate is likely to begin to edge  lower  as some of the special  factorsholding down inflation  wear off and higher inflation  rates begin to affectexpectations.  Moreover, even  very high real federal  funds rates may notnecessarily  indicate  restraint or even  neutrality in  monetary policy when otherimportant  elements  in overall financial conditions are  considered, especiallytaking account  of the strong demand for capital.  Real  short-  and long-termrates  close to current levels  have apparently  allowed  output to overshootsustainable levels,  and in the staff forecast  this situation is not correctedwithout a change in policy.Still, considerable  uncertainty  persists about the level and  growth ofpotential output and the implications  for inflation  of operating  for a  time withthe current degree  of tautness in labor markets,  which may be seen  assupporting  a continuation  of the wait-and-see  posture  of alternative  B.  Thedrop in inflation expectations  provides  an additional  counterweight  to theeffects of resource pressures  on prices,  allowing the Committee to awaitfirmer signs that inflation  is likely to intensify without risking a  substantialacceleration  in prices.  And with inventory investment likely to slow, the oddson  a near-term strengthening  of production  that would increase  resourceutilization  rates have diminished.  Recently more volatile  conditions infinancial  markets  may also counsel caution.  This development  may beassociated  with some second  thoughts about just how rosy the  outlook forprices,  profits, and interest rates  may be.  If markets  become  more cautious,equity prices and  credit  spreads  would become  a little less  stimulative.If the  Committee  were to choose to keep the stance  of policyunchanged,  it would  need again to consider whether to retain the  asymmetryin  its directive.  As compared  to the  situation in early July  when theCommittee  last voted to have  an  asymmetric  directive,  the favorable  behaviorof prices  and price expectations,  along with a  slightly less  expansive  staffforecast  for growth going  forward, may be read as reducing  the urgency totake action should any  signs  of inflation pressures  emerge  over the near term.On the other hand, the basic  situation has not changed  since  early July:  The8/19/97labor market  continues to operate  at levels beyond  most estimates ofsustainable  potential,  and strength in  consumption  and investment spendingseems  to suggest  that financial conditions,  at least those prevailing  a littlewhile  ago, have not been tight enough  to prompt  a closing  of any output gap.This brings  me to the language  of the directive.  As  you suggested,  Mr.Chairman,  I polled the members  for their views on  the wording of the twosentences,  and as I suspected,  there were almost  as many  suggestions asmembers.  I tried to boil these down  to  a few  alternatives,  which were sent tothe Committee  and  are repeated beginning  on page  12  of the Bluebook.  Onthe first  sentence,  most members preferred  the alternative  sentence  in the JuneBluebook, though some  suggested relatively  minor wording  changes.President Boehne's  alternative,  labeled  "New  Alternative,"  seems to have theadvantage  of eliminating  the somewhat/slightly  distinction  from the firstsentence--employed  in the past to differentiate  50 from  25  basis point actions,but perhaps not needed  to describe actions  taken  at the meeting  now that theCommittee  is explicit  about the actual  federal  funds rate it expects.  It alsoeliminates  the tighten/maintain/ease  choice on  reserve conditions,  whichseveral  other members  also  suggested.Consensus  was less clear  on the second  sentence.  Although  quite a fewmembers  preferred  the June  Bluebook alternative,  there  were a number ofother suggestions.  The wording  given  as "New  Alternative  1" is also basedon President  Boehne's  suggestion  and would  conform the June  Bluebookalternative  for the second  sentence to his alternative  for the first sentence.  Inkeeping with a suggestion  several  of you made, it puts the  possible change  interms  of an increase  or decrease  in the federal  funds rate,  instead of reserveconditions.  However,  a few  of you also thought that the asymmetry  was  aboutpresumptions,  or inclinations,  or risks rather than weight given  to incomingdata.  This approach  may be more consistent  with the notion  that the directivetilt is  a signal  of the risks the Committee  sees, and  hence the more likelydirection  of its next  action, without any  necessary implication  for theupcoming  intermeeting  period.  In the circumstances,  the tilt implies that youwould move relatively promptly if  the data  seemed to confirm your concerns,and that you  have a hard  time imagining  moving in the other direction, thoughsuch  an  action cannot be ruled out  in very unexpected  circumstances.  I triedto capture  some  flavor of this in the second new  alternative.  However,  on re-reading  this alternative,  I'm not sure better  language  couldn't have been foundto express this view--for  example,  "In the context of ... , the Committeebelieves that  developments  are more likely over time to require a tighteningthan an easing of reserve  conditions to attain its objectives."The difficulty  of framing  a consensus  on  the second question maysuggest that leaving  the current wording  in place for this  sentence,  or tinkeringwith  it only very  slightly, ought to be seriously considered.  The  currentwording,  however awkward,  does not try to spell out what the Committee8/19/97means by asymmetry but merely  states the kind of actions  the  Committeewould, or might, find acceptable.  If the Committee  changes  the first sentencebut wants to leave the second  essentially unchanged,  it could  conform thesecond sentence  simply by substituting  "higher"  and "lower"  "federal  fundsrate"  for greater and lesser reserve  restraint, though even  this change mightnot be needed.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Let's see if we can  make some progress  on this.  I havethe general  impression  that there is a  consensus around the Boehne  alternative  for the first sentence.I will  assume that is the case unless somebody wishes to raise  an objection  here.  [Pause]  Nothearing one, I will assume  that we  will make that change,  which really  has carried  us much furtherthan anyone would have anticipated!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Should we stop?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think we have  to focus on whether we  should leave  thesecond sentence  alone,  apart from the minor adjustment that Don Kohn has  mentioned, or try to gofurther.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Leave it alone.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The major problem  I always have  had with this directivehas been in the first sentence.  I find  all the proposed variations  of the second  sentence to becircumlocutions  in one way or another.  The difficulty is that we are trying to reflect differingopinions  as to how we should view  the question  of asymmetry.  That is an issue  we never havebeen  able to resolve among  ourselves.  There  are  differences  in this Committee  and very  legitimatedifferences.  Yet, I think we all find a value in maintaining  the notion  of symmetry  and asymmetry,though  for somewhat different reasons.  There has  never been any consensus, as  I read the views ofthis Committee, to eliminate that concept.  So,  my inclination  at this  stage, given my  suspicion ofwhat would  happen if we tried to resolve  something that we have  failed to do in the past for  goodreasons--8/19/97

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  No lunch would be the consequence!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is a very thoughtful way of putting it.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Thoughtful  and practical.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  After going through  a lot of the possible variations  withDon Kohn,  it strikes  me that we  are not going to succeed in resolving this issue at this  stage, and itprobably is not worth the effort of the Committee  to try to force  something that would make  anumber of us feel uncomfortable.  I am inclined to put on the table as a potential  resolution  of thisto make just the minor change that Don Kohn  has  suggested.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Could you repeat  that, Don?  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I'm just opening the issue  up for questions.  Don, in thatcontext would you read the operational  paragraph  of the  directive  with those changes?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Okay.  I'm on page  13  of the  Bluebook and I will start with the "NewAlternative."  If you chose  Alternative  B  and translated  the July directive into this, it would read:"In  the implementation  of policy for the immediate  future the Committee seeks conditions  inreserve  markets consistent with maintaining  the federal funds rate  at an  average  of around 5-1/2percent.  In the context  of the Committee's long-run  objectives  for price  stability and sustainableeconomic  growth,  and giving  careful  consideration  to economic,  financial,  and monetarydevelopments,  a somewhat higher federal  funds rate would  or a slightly lower federal funds ratemight be acceptable  in the intermeeting  period."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That wording  is not satisfactory to everybody,  but it iseverybody's second  choice, if I may put it that way.  I would be  inclined to go with that, but Iwould like to hear the Committee's views.  Governor  Phillips.8/19/97"slightly?"

[SECTION]

MS. PHILLIPS.  What is the purpose  of differentiating between  "somewhat"  and

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It gives you the asymmetry  in effect.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  We have not worked that  out.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  We have  two methods  of establishing that;  the  other is the use of "would"and "might."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The two  methods together have  been used when wewanted to express a  strong degree of asymmetry.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  "Somewhat"  is  stronger than "slightly?"

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Well, this  has not been  clear to me in the past!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It wasn't supposed to be!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I am going to write that down  so I won't forget it next time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  Well,  Mr. Chairman,  I would say that you are  in error in one respect.  Itis not everybody's  second  choice.  It is my first choice.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I  am delighted  to be  corrected.  In a hidden  sense it ismine,  too.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, just a comment  here:  The only thing that bothers meabout making these changes--and  I think I made this comment  at the  meeting last time--is  that whatwe are  doing here is to be clearer about our operating instrument without  making correspondingchanges  with respect  to the language on our longer-term  goals.  That worries me because  I think itis going  to increase  the already intense focus  on the funds rate, and  that, I think, is one of the8/19/97principal  difficulties  we face currently in  conducting  monetary policy in the short run.  I don'tknow how  far I'll get with this, but I would like to make this suggestion  concerning the lead  clausein the  second  sentence.  There  are no suggestions  on the table now for changing  it, but it currentlyreads:  "In the context  of the Committee's  long-run objectives  for price  stability  and sustainableeconomic  growth...".  Is it possible to consider  changing that  to:  "In  the context of theCommittee's long-run  objectives, which  assign priority to price  stability as  a prerequisite  forachieving  sustainable economic  growth..."?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That  is a fundamental change.  The words have beenfudged in such a manner as to avoid stating  that.  I think you are  quite right on  the issue of givingprominence to  the funds rate, and I think we  all recognize  that were we  able to find financialaggregates  that reflect the state of the money markets  and that we could employ to gain leverage inthe system, we would find that preferable  to  targeting the funds rate.  The  latter has  all the problemsthat we have discussed  over the  years.  Having  gone in the direction of announcing  changes  in thefederal funds  rate after our meetings,  all we are doing  is moving that explicitly  into the directive.  Ifat some point we are able to shift away  from the  funds rate,  then the directive  will  get changed  andour public  statement will get changed.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I was just going to say, Mr. Chairman,  that you have made wonderfulprogress  here this morning, and I do not think we ought to jeopardize  it.  We ought to support it asa group and consider it time well spent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Why don't you make a motion?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  If I could, I would.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  He's not a voting  member.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Can we make  you an honorary  one?  [Laughter]8/19/97

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I will  make an honorary motion.

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN.  I will second the  honorary motion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Technically,  it is true if we  are  taking a vote of theCommittee  as  presently constituted.  But as  a practical matter, the vote has  to include everybodyaround  the table because  we are  making  changes that  will  involve all  of us.  So, the "votes"  of thosewho are  temporarily nonmembers  should be taken  into account.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  Can I make it legal by moving  the Boehne motion?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  You could  do so.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I second the Boehne  motion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Would you read the Boehne  motion, just to make  sure weknow what it says?

MR. BERNARD.  The first sentence,  assuming  alternative  B, would be:  "In  theimplementation  of policy for the immediate  future,  the  Committee seeks conditions  in reserve

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  And go on.

[SECTION]

MR.  BERNARD.  The next sentence,  if I have  it down correctly and using the same tiltas in the July directive  would  read:  "In the context  of the Committee's  long-run  objectives  for pricestability  and sustainable  economic  growth,  and giving  careful consideration  to economic,  financial,and monetary  developments,  a somewhat  higher federal  funds rate would  or a slightly lower federalfunds  rate might be acceptable  in the intermeeting  period."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Well,  I merely followed you two gentlemen.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I would like to add Governor Rivlin  for drawingattention to the practical  consideration that got this discussion  over with.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN. I thank everybody.  [Laughter]  Are there  any questionson the first part of Don Kohn's presentation  relating  to monetary policy?

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Don, before each FOMC  meeting we are provided  a memo  on whatvarious rules are indicating, the  Taylor rule particularly.  My recollection  is that  the equilibriumreal interest rate  constructed  in that case is for  a 2 percent real  funds rate,  using the chained  GDPdeflator.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Do you want to talk briefly  about the table at the bottom of chart  10 inyour handout  and its implications?  While  I am a strong believer in some  of the wisdom embeddedin the Taylor rule,  I have been concerned  for  a long time that we need to be more careful  about howwe set  its level  by coming up with a  more reasonable  estimate of the equilibrium real  funds rate.The 2 percent comes from Taylor's heuristic  rounding.  Do you think this table provides asomewhat  more thoughtful  estimate?8/19/97

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  I think that if we took it literally,  and I would have  to look at that, itactually would be a little  higher if we used the  GDP deflator over time,  which is what Taylor's  ruleis based  on.  These days the GDP deflator tends to run  a little below the CPI, but over time  I think itruns  a little above.  So, if we use the  deflator, the gap  between  the 2 percent and what  we mightthink  of as history  over the  1965  to  1997  period would be a little larger.  So,  we need  to think aboutthat rule in the  context of what price index we are  using, what changes have been  made to the priceindex over the years that  might have  distorted it going back in history,  and whether  it may be lessdistorted now.  I think most researchers,  as we have been told over the past few years, have  notfound a big change in the  amount of bias in  the indexes, but we  need to be careful  about that.  Ithink all these  factors are important.  I know that partly at your behest, Governor  Meyer, people onthe  staff are trying  to take  account of these various factors  and make  a more sophisticated,technically justifiable estimate  of the real funds rate  even for the very  simple Taylor rule.  The  realfunds rate in that rule is not allowed  to move around.  The other major issue, even  if we know  howto measure  the real funds  rate, is whether  it moves around from time to time.  So, we should takeaccount  of all  these  other aspects.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  Don, I have  a question  for you that comes fromdown  15 to 25 basis points,  but yields on indexed  debt were about unchanged,  suggesting that  aslight reduction"  etc.  Is part  of the reason  you use the term "suggesting"  that you believe  that thesebonds  are new enough and still not liquid enough  that they will  not tell us as much as  they might"X"  years  from now when they are  not so new and  have become  more liquid?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  That  is one of the factors, President  McDonough,  in the sense  thatrelatively  small trades  can push these  rates around because  these markets are  not liquid, and I think8/19/97we need to be careful  about interpreting  small ups and downs  in the yields.  On the  other hand,  Idon't think the lack of liquidity in the  market vitiates  their usefulness entirely.  There are  a fewfolks out there,  at least as  one talks to  people on the Street, who  are keeping  their eye on thesethings.  They are  doing a little trading.  And if there were  a sense,  for example, that the  economywas terribly  strong  and the Fed really needed to raise  real interest rates  a lot to keep inflation  downand was  going to do  so,  I think these  yields would  go up.  Now, we would  have to be careful aboutwhether we  should count  every basis point and look at that  spread for every  basis point.  I think it isuseful to look at that yield and at the spread in a  general  kind of way, but we  have to be careful  notto slice it too thinly.Another factor  here is relative  supply.  The Treasury  has cut back on its note auctions,and in particular  it has  eliminated  a  ten-year note  auction or two  and is concentrating  more of itsissuance in the indexed  area.  So there may be, particularly  with a thin market, some relative  supplyeffects that  ordinarily we  would think would wash  out very quickly in  a nominal bond market butthat may have some effect in  the indexed  market.  Nonetheless,  I think the fact  that the spread  hascome down by almost  50 basis points  over four months  suggests something.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  I think you have  it just right.  I believe  it tells ussomething, but we  have to be very careful  not to get overly caught up with it quite yet.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  The other point I would make about  the sentence that you pointed to is thatwe characterize  it as  inflation compensation.  There  is another part  to inflation compensation.  It isnot only expectations;  it is the inflation  risk premium.  One  had a sense, particularly over the springthrough the end of July, that not only were people perhaps  a little more optimistic  on inflation, butthey were a little less  uncertain  about their optimism.  So, one reason that nominal  yields mighthave  dropped relative  to the real yield is not entirely  a decline  in inflation  expectations  but a8/19/97inflation  would turn out to be a lot different  than  they expected  it to be.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The term  "inflation  compensation"  is really  a word  of artbecause  what is being projected  here is not true inflation expectations,  including the risk premium,but a forecast of the  CPI as published.  And that may or may not be exactly  equal to inflationexpectations.  But shouldn't the word "expectations"  be in this sentence--"a  slight reduction in"expected"  long-term inflation compensation"?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  It is a reduction in the  actual  compensation  that investors  are  demandingfor buying a nominal bond.  Its  size would depend on their expectations  for inflation  and  on thestandard error or standard  deviation--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  It is based on their forecast of the CPI.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Right.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  MCDONOUGH.  It is a kind of economist's  9-by-12,  I think.[Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for Don?  If not,  let me start.  I will be agood  deal briefer than I have been of late.  To be  sure, as Governor  Kelley indicated, not all thatmuch has changed  in  the period  since the last meeting,  but there  are  a few  fundamentals that I thinkrequire  a bit of evaluation.The most recent period is interesting  because it reinforces the  notion that we still may beexperiencing  disinflation.  That is, it is very clear in looking  at the price indexes--whether  we areusing the CPI, the  PPI, or the various  NIPA data on  prices--that the inflation  rate over these last sixmonths  has been coming in lower than in  1996  or at the least has been  unchanged.  This is reallyquite relevant, especially  since the data on domestic  operating profit margins  still seem to be  edging8/19/97higher.  Taken together,  these two  factors clearly imply that consolidated  unit costs  for thenonfinancial  corporate  sector  are moving up  only very modestly.  Indeed,  our latest estimate  for thefour quarters  ended in the  second quarter  of 1997  is  that consolidated  unit costs  have gone up just.4 percent.  Since net interest  payments per unit continue  to fall,  the increase in unit labor costsremains rather modest though  obviously  higher than the rise in total unit costs.  Unit labor costs  areup about  1.2 percent over the four quarters, but higher productivity  growth is  factored into that.Indeed, the productivity  increase  for the nonfinancial  corporate sector  looks something like 2-1/4percent, with average hourly compensation  moving up close to 3-1/2  percent.The  significance of all this is that we have continued to get this sort of data for quite awhile.  Indeed,  I used almost the same  set of numbers  several months ago with the sole exception ofproductivity,  which seems to be accelerating  for nonfinancial  corporations.  The  obverse of this isthat the decline  in noncorporate  business productivity,  as residually estimated,  seems also to haveaccelerated  in the most recent period.  That explains  why, when  we bring the corporate  andnoncorporate  sectors  together,  we get this modest increase in total  nonfarm productivity.  Theproblem with that number is that it cannot explain the rise in profit margins, whether we includeonly nonfinancial  corporate margins  or the broader  margins where we add in the appropriate  part ofnoncorporate  earnings or noncorporate  profitability.  Of course,  the problem in this context is ourinability to price  services appropriately;  they have  a substantial  overlap with the noncorporatesector.The question  is, which data do we believe  are the  most accurate?  The profit  figures haveto be reasonably  accurate  in the  sense that they come out the same way no matter  how we calculatethem.  The price data doubtless have biases in them, but there is no evidence  that the bias ischanging significantly.  Clearly, if prices  are  going up very modestly  and profit margins  are8/19/97increasing,  we  are  forced  algebraically  to conclude  that consolidated  unit costs are going nowhere.If that  is in fact the case,  it is inconsistent with the nonfarm  productivity data, and we have  tochoose which  data we believe are best describing the current  state of the economy.  I suspect thatwe  ought to be able to find out, hopefully within a year or two,  whether this issue is ultimatelyresolved  by the closing of the statistical  discrepancy  or by some extraordinary  discovery  of newdata that create  a more reasonable  set of real noncorporate  gross product.Despite the absence  of indications that inflation  may be accelerating,  signs  are beginningto emerge  that suggest  we may finally be running out the string.  The major sign relates tocompensation  per hour whose relatively subdued  behavior I have attributed  largely  to jobinsecurity,  a view  that is subject  to some controversy.  I recognize  that the econometric  analyses areof dubious  value on this issue, and  I am sometimes  inclined to  suggest that instead  of trying to findout what people believe by using detailed  and  indirect econometric  analysis,  we might trysomething terribly novel.  We might ask them.  When people  are  asked whether they fear that theyare  going to lose their jobs, and the same question  is asked of basically the same sample  year afteryear, we find that the proportion of people responding in  the affirmative  doubles  from the recessionperiod of 1991  to the mid-1990s, leading one to conclude  that people mean  what they say.  Butsurvey respondents  are  now saying  that they are  not as nervous  as they were  earlier; that is, thesurvey results  are  beginning to tilt in  the direction  of less concern  as tight labor markets havepersisted for  a now protracted  period of time.  Indeed, one statistical  estimate that had beensignificantly  subdued throughout this period--namely,  the measure  of the number  of people whovoluntarily leave their jobs to seek other employment--is  finally  showing  some signs of moving upthe way it did in past periods.  So, the notion that the  insecurity  issue is beginning to wane isgetting some  statistical verification.8/19/97Leaving  aside the NAIRU and  other issues involved  in evaluating unemployment  andlabor force  participation,  we still have  the problem  of determining how many  people are left in thenoninstitutional  population  who want to work.  That number is diminishing  at a very rapid pace.The number of people who say they want a job but are  not currently  seeking  one, which  bydefinition  puts them out  of the labor force,  has  gone down  1-1/2 million, as I recall,  in the last threeyears.  This implies a fairly dramatic squeeze  on the potential  labor supply in the sense that  anannual increase  of 2 percent on  average  in both payroll and  household employment  in recent yearsis matched  against growth in the working-age  population that is half that rate.  We do not have togo through  a Phillips curve analysis,  nor any other analysis, to conclude  that when we  run out of aproduct--in  this case labor--its  price goes up.  At some point something  has to give.  The processstill appears to be at a very early  stage, and  it is moving slowly.  It may well  be that the realsignificance  of the UPS  strike is that we  are beginning to see a reversal of what had been  a dramaticdevelopment:  The air traffic  controllers'  confrontation  with President Reagan  set in motion  afundamental change  in policy for this country more than  15 years  ago.  It is conceivable  that wewill look back at the  UPS strike and say that it too  signaled a significant change.  I don't knowwhether that is true or whether that impression may change when we look at the data after all thepublicity  spins stop in the next 48 to 72 hours and we begin to learn  what actually happened.  But itis clear that  something is  going on in that  area.The important  question that we have to ask ourselves  is whether the fairly significantpickup  in effective demand  in  the last six weeks or so will moderate  before  the pressures on  wagesbegin to work their way through to prices.  As Mike Prell pointed out, the  crucial  element in thenear-term outlook for economic activity is the inventory situation.  Certain  conclusions  probablyare not unreasonable.  The first is that we do not need  any liquidation of inventories  for the8/19/97economic  expansion to  slow; all we  need is slowing  in the  rate of increase.  It is  quite conceivablethat we  can  have,  as we have  had  over the last six months,  a  very dramatic  increase in inventoriesthat is wholly voluntary,  wholly the result of inventory-sales  ratios having gotten too low andbottoming  out.  Obviously,  if we have an inventory-sales  ratio that declines  and then flattens  out,inventory investment  surges at that particular point.  But there is  also a concern  that we can stillhave  very low  inventory-sales  ratios even  after the big surge.  This, indeed,  may result  in a viewthat there is no  inventory  overhang  in any meaningful  sense.  However,  as I  said, the rate  ofincrease  in inventories  merely has to moderate  to slow the economy,  meaning  that the rate ofinventory investment falls.I think the inventory  investment  forecast in the Greenbook  has an important  element ofcredibility  because at  this stage neither  the new orders  data nor any anecdotal  reports  suggestserious  inventory level problems.  But the numbers do seriously  suggest  that the inventoryinvestment  level is excessive.  To get a sense of whether there is something  illusory in  theGreenbook  forecast, I have  converted the  inventory investment  numbers  to factory  value,  as distinctfrom chain-weighted  deflated book value.  If the physical quantity  of goods  does not change butmerely moves  from the  factory level  to the  retail level,  the constant dollar  value of the inventoriesrises.  The reason is that as  goods move  from  one sector of the distribution  channel to the  next,value is  added and income is created.  For national  income  accounting purposes, it is indeed thebook value  where held, properly  deflated,  that is relevant  to the income and product accountcalculations.  But to  measure  whether inventories  are excessive  or not,  we don't care  where theunits are  held in the distribution stream.  Whether  automobiles  are in inventories  at the dealer  level,at the  factory level,  or somewhere  in the  pipeline  is  of no  significance to  the level of assemblies  butit is to  GDP.8/19/97In any event, stripping  out the markups in the distribution process,  the factory  value datafor inventory  investment for the first half of 1997  are  very significantly  above  the peak levels  of1994 and  early  1995,  whereas that is not true for the deflated  NIPA total book value data.  I don'tknow whether you can see  this chart from where  you  are sitting, but the black bars  are what theofficial NIPA data  show, and they are at about the  same level as they were  in  1994.  However, ifyou look only at factory value, it is up close to the NIPA  data in the first half of 1997,  but it wasmuch lower in  1994 because  a substantial part of those earlier data reflected  markups and  notincreased  numbers of units.Secondly,  Cathy Minehan  raised the issue  as to whether, in fact, the inventories  wereproduced by domestic  firms or were  imported.  With the caveat  that the data themselves  are  verydubious,  the staff here has tried to associate  imports with various types  of inventories  in order toestimate  separate domestic  and foreign-originated  inventories.  Overall,  the levels have  tended torun about one-fourth  imported, three-fourths  domestically  produced.  Through  April  and May, theproportion  of inventory investment that was imported was about one-fifth--or  less than normal.  Inthat sense,  we are not getting any evidence,  at least in these  data, suggesting  that all the inventorybuildup is  coming from imports, which,  if it were the case,  would mean that the impact of theiradjustment would be on foreign  producers  and not on domestic  production.  The NIPA  inventoryinvestment  data appear to derive disproportionately  from domestic production.  Hence,  the impactof the slowdown in  inventory growth on the GDP shown  in the Greenbook is credible.If we find instead that final  demand  is significantly  higher and that we  get further  stronginventory  accumulation from either a wealth effect or factors that are  related to inventoryinvestment, we will  not get a slowdown  in the growth  of GDP.  In that case, we will  face someserious policy questions.  My judgment is,  as we have discussed before, that we will have  no choice8/19/97but to tighten because if we do not, the risks will be  too high,  no matter whether  one is in box A, B,C,  or D of Peter Fisher's  little structure.  So, I think we need to recognize  at this  stage that thereLet me add something  parenthetically that was  hinted at but not put on the table.  A  verybig part of the consumer price index  is related to property  values.  You will  recall  that about  19percent of the CPI is imputed  owners'  equivalent  rent.  Rents  are tied to property  values.  Rent as aratio to the market  value of single-family  homes has  been falling  for quite a long period  of time.And the little pop that we saw  in the last CPI may be an indication  that this ratio is stabilizing  ormoving back  to a  somewhat higher path, which  suggests that the services  CPI may  look a littlestronger in the near future  than  we have seen of late.  We are going  to have to make a judgment  asto whether we  should look  at property-value-related  prices  somewhat differently  from prices  thatare related  in effect to income  flows.  I have raised this  issue before,  but we never really haveconfronted it because  the issue has never come up with respect  to a question  of monetary  policy.  Iwould not be surprised  if what  we encounter is  a CPI that looks  a lot stronger but  one where  the risein inflation  will be very narrowly  concentrated  in these property-value-priced  areas.  Commodityprices  could be going down,  other prices could be  going down, and these prices could be going  up.What  should we be looking  at?  That  may well prove to be  an interesting question.In  summary, my general  view  has not  basically changed.  As I see it, the real  federalfunds rate,  as Don Kohn  pointed out, is sufficiently  high that we need not be concerned thatmonetary policy is out  of sync  at this point or that it is  far off from where we will  want it to be inany event.  And with disinflation  probably still going on, there  is very little reason to  move today,as has been  the case for a number of meetings.  Nonetheless,  as many of you  have argued,  and Ithink quite  correctly, the risks are  on the upside  and there also is  little reason to  discard the8/19/97asymmetric  directive  toward tightening.  Nothing  out there of which  I am aware  suggests that theunderlying  pressures  are very different  from what they have been  for quite a long period  of time.President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  I can accept  your recommendation,  Alan.  I will not say much moreother than to express the wish that we had the  groundwork  in place  to lock in  these lower  inflationrates.  I do not think we have.  It would be  an excellent  time to act opportunistically,  as I have saidbefore.  I worry  a little about whether there will be a defensible  rationale that  will permit us to actbefore inflation  actually  starts to rise.  That is going to be a challenge.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  I think it is going to be difficult.  The reason is that thelonger we  are in a period  where the economy  remains  exceptionally  tight and price inflationcontinues to go down, the more  difficult  it will be for us to make a credible  case for a policytightening  move,  indeed around this table let alone how we explain  it to everybody else.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Just one last question because  you raised  the issue in yourcommentary.  We have  noticed an  uptick in housing-related  components  of the CPI.  There  also areincreases  in other asset prices that people  are  worried  about, obviously  the stock market,nonresidential  real estate,  and so forth.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Remember that  the nonresidential  real  estate  sector  showsup in the CPI for hotels, lodging,  and--8/19/97

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes, exactly.  I probably  am asking the same  question  that you  wereposing:  What do we do with monetary policy when there is no inflation but asset prices  arebooming?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  That is the question that  I raised in a speech just beforethe  sentence in which I expressed  concern  about how we  will know when we encounter irrationalexuberance.

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes, in your AEI speech.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  We  have not been able to address that issue because  Idon't think we know how to handle a problem where we have one instrument  and conflicting  goals.What do we do?  What should the Japanese  have  done when confronted  with a very benign productprice  environment  and rapidly escalating asset prices?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I will be reading  from page  13  of the Bluebook, and  then coming  backto page  12  for the last sentence.  The first  sentence, then, is under the  "New  Alternative"  headingon page  13:  "In  the implementation  of policy for the immediate  future, the Committee  seeksconditions  in reserve markets  consistent  with maintaining  the federal  funds rate  at an average  ofaround 5-1/2 percent."  Then, moving just below that  to the "Current  Wording"  section  for thesecond sentence:  "In  the context  of the Committee's long-run  objectives  for price  stability andsustainable  economic  growth, and giving careful  consideration  to  economic,  financial, andmonetary  developments,  a  somewhat higher federal  funds rate would or a  slightly lower federalfunds rate might be acceptable in  the intermeeting  period."  Finally, to catch  up with the lastsentence on page  12  under the "Standard Version"  heading:  "The contemplated reserve  conditionsare expected  to be consistent with moderate  growth of M2 and M3  over coming  months."
