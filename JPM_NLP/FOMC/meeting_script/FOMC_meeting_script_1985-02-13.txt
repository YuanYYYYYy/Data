CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If we  can  come to  order,  the first  item  ofbusiness  is  electing  the Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  after  surveying the membership  ofthis  group  and  thinking  of various  outsiders  who might[unintelligible]  a change  in  the  law,  I conclude that  I wish tonominate  Gerald  Corrigan as  the  Vice  Chairman  of the  Federal Open

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  second  came  awfully  quickly!  Arethere  any  objections?  I haven't heard  any,  so Mr.  Corrigan  is  dulyelected  and  the  Secretary will  so  record.  We  have  to  approve  theminutes.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  So  moved.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  I second that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without objection.  Why  are  the  reports onforeign currency  and  domestic  open market  operations  separated  [on  theagenda]?  We  will  go  to  foreign currency  operations  first,  anyway.Are you  prepared to  report  on  domestic  open market  operations,  Mr.Sternlight?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Yes  I am.  Sure.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  we'll  go  to Mr.  Cross  first  and  yousecond.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any discussion?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Sam,  after  listening to  the  conversations  inBasle, would  you get  the  impression  that  if  sentiment  on interventionis  moving in  any  direction  at  all,  it's  moving in  the direction ofdoing something  more drastic--perhaps without  the  United States--[say],  accumulation of  some  resources  from interest  and  hitting the

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  Well,  it's  very  difficult  to  say  what  they mightdo.  I would think that  the desire,  obviously, is  very much to  havethe  United  States:  (a) take  the  lead;  and  (b) certainly,  participate.Now, whether they will  bring  themselves  to  very  large  intervention  inour  absence--if we  are  out  of the  market  entirely--looks  prettydoubtful.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  What  kind  of money  are  they talking  about?

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  I don't  know that  anybody  is  talking  about  anyspecific  amount  of money.  I think there  is  a problem in that  the2/12-13/85operations  that  have  been undertaken during this  period--certainly  onthe  United  States  side  on the  occasions  that we  have  operated--havebeen  limited  to  fairly modest  amounts.  On  one  occasion  it  was  $40million and  on  another occasion  $48  million;  the most  we did was  closeto  $150  million.  There  certainly is  a feeling that  one  needs  to  actboth  in  greater amounts  and  also with  a greater  forcefulness,  as  itwere.  They  understand the  U.S.  view about  not  wanting,  as  I said,  tobash  the  currency;  but  they  do  feel that  something needs  to  be  done  todeal  with  these  exchange  rates  more forcefully than  has  been  done.There  was  certainly  some uncertainty in  the market  after  the  G-5announcement  about  what  it meant.  As  time  has  gone  by, that hastended to  fizzle  out  and  there has  been  the feeling  that  theintervention, while not  insignificant,  really hasn't been  of  aforceful  and  large  nature,  given  the  magnitude  of the  problem.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [Unintelligible]  go  about  intervention  inthe  least  effective  way--in fact,  I would say  a counterproductive way.You  can  follow up  on--

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  if  I may pursue this  a minute.  Didn'tyou  get  the  impression--I  did myself--that the  German intervention  ofhanded  and  clumsy at  the  time,  is  regarded  much more positively  overthere  as  having been  a really  successful  operation?  Maybe that's[why]  they  seem to  think it's  the  way  to  go--to  wait  until  the  dollaris  softening  and then push  it  down.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  Yes,  I certainly think that.  Absolutely.  As  atactical move, the  German operation  of  September  did introduce  aconsiderable amount  of two-way  risk  and  uncertainty  in the  market.  Itwas  very heavy and  it  is  seen  as  having been  a very  useful andattractive  operation.  Now, in  subsequent  times  when they have takensimilar  kinds  of  actions,  they have  not been  as  effective.  But  Idon't  disagree with you.  I think it  had  a very powerful  impact  on  thewas  going  to  be  hit  again one  of these  days.  That  certainlyintroduced  a certain  caution in  the market  and  I would  think that  thatis  a useful  thing to  do.  There  is  certainly,  on the  part  of  some  ofthe Europeans,  a strong  desire to  see  if tactics  of  that  sort  couldnot  be  used  again with the  same  impact.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  But  it  inevitably  runs  out  of  steam, doesn't  it?Where was  the mark  then?  What  was the mark/dollar  rate  when they  didall  that  intervention?

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  Yes.  It  went  up  on  the  day  that  they  hit  it[hard];  at  its  height  it  was  3.17  and  it  went  down  about  4 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  And where  is  it  today?

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  It's  at  3.29,  but  between  September  and Februaryit  went  up.  It  certainly  was  an  element  that  introduced  a great  dealof caution  into  the market  and  I think it  did have  a lasting  effectfor  some  period of  time.  On that  day  I believe  they spent  about  $400million;  we're not  talking massive amounts  in the  billions  that werespent.  I think everybody  is  fully cognizant  of  the  limitations  ofintervention;  in  fact,  maybe too  much so.  No  one  expects  it  by itselfto  solve  all  the problems  in Europe  or  here.  But  certainly  there  is  a2/12-13/85view that,  properly  and  forcefully used,  it  can  be  one  additionalweapon that  can  be  very helpful  in  keeping this  quite troublesomeexchange market  situation  perhaps  a little  less  volatile--I meanvolatile  in  the  upward  sense.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  On the  other  side  of the  coin,though, Henry,  if  nothing happens  to  the  exchange  rate,  I think it  ispretty  clear  that  there's  likely to  be more  pressure  on  interest  ratesin  a number  of  those  countries.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Yes,  that's  the  point  that  several  of themmade.

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  I think all,  or  certainly a lot,  of  the Europeansare  going  to be  under  upward pressure  on  their  interest  rates  if theirexchange  rates  continue  to  depreciate.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Governor  Wallich,  if  I may add  a  [different]and  maybe minority view on that  operation:  I would  tend  to  deny  itssuccess.  I think it  was  rather  a hit  and  run  operation  and  that  thefailure  of the  dollar  to  go  up--if that's  a failure--subsequently, hada lot  to  do  with the  drop  in  interest  rates  in  this  country throughthe  winter.  And  I think the  expectation that  that  [decline]  wascoming to  a halt was  instrumental  in  the  dollar  turning  around.  Whenit  turned  around  and  got  to  that  point  it  just went  right  through it;it  kept  going,  as  there was  no  intervention of  significant  size  anddetermination  forthcoming  at  that  time.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I'm  simply  saying that we  took  a negative viewof that  operation;  we  viewed  it  as  being  contrary  to  good practice ofnot  driving the  rate but  leaning  against  the  wind.  They  seem to  takea more  positive view  of  it.  And they  seem to be  of  a mind to  repeatit  even though they know that  they wouldn't  get  our  cooperation  on  anoperation  like that.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Looking back over  the  last  4 weeks,  if we  aregoing  to  do  something like  this,  what's  the  strategy  of doing  it  theway we  have  done  it?  If we're  going to  do  it,  we  ought  to  do  it  withsome  conviction  or  it's  hardly worth the  trouble  at  all.  It  seemsthat  we're  intervening  as  though we're kind  of being  forced  to  do  itand we  really don't want  to.  Our  intervention doesn't  strike me  asbeing very  convincing  to  anybody.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Are you  answering that  question,  Mr.Cross?

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  I don't  think anyone  will  disagree with whatyou've  said.  I think you're  right:  that  we  need  to  act  moreforcefully  if we're  going  to  go  in there,  and  show that  we meanbusiness  and  that  we  are  prepared  to  do  something  in other  than tokenamounts.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  There  are  several  cooks  in  this  broth  andsome  are  from rather  provincial provinces.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Just  to  follow that  up:  As we  talk  about  ourintervention, how much  control do  we have  over it  at  this  point?  Any2/12-13/85at  all?  Do  we  have  any say,  unilaterally, as  to  what  the  central  bankwill  do?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  We  [unintelligible]  the  central bank.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Okay.  It  may be  that  unless  others  change theirminds we  don't  have  any choice.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we  don't  operate  unilaterally.Neither  does  the  Treasury.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Is  this  episode  about  over,  Paul?  As  I recall,on  the  [FOMC  telephone  conference]  call  you  said  it  was  [to  last]  fora few weeks.  A few weeks  have  gone  by.  Has  it  terminated?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think we're  bound by  that,particularly.  Obviously, we  haven't been  acting  effectively at  all--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Not  at  all,  recently.  That's  why  I asked  thequestion.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  --in  the  burst  of the  last  couple  of  days.But  I wouldn't  say minds  couldn't  change  [if]  this  [dollar]  movementgets  pretty strong.  But  I think it  had  better  get  strong  enough  sothat--.  I personally  am  sick  and tired  of doing  ineffectual  things.I want  to be  effectual,  or  at  least have  a chance  of  being effectual.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Sam, do  you  get  the  impression that  theBritish  are  going  to  resist  pretty forcefully  allowing  sterling tocome  into  parity with the  dollar?

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  Well,  resist?  We're almost  there.  They areconcerned  about  the  exchange  rate.  They  have  raised  their  interestrates  by  an  enormous  amount  and  they  have  a very  soft  economy.  So  inthat  sense,  they  really have  moved very,  very  strongly.  They  have  notdone  an  enormous  amount  in  intervention.  They  have  done  some,  but--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  They  have  done  very  little  intervention.

[SECTION]

MR.  CROSS.  --very  little.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  At  one  point  they put  their  interest  ratesup  4 percentage  points.  Do  you consider  that  a  strong  action  in  thespace  of  about  3 days?

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  But  the  question was:  How much  further  arethey  prepared to  go?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Up  another  4 points?  They may not  beprepared.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  How  likely would  it  be  that  we  would  put  oursdown  4 points?

[SECTION]

MR. CROSS.  I think they  feel that  the  4-1/2  points  that  theyhave  done  is  really  quite  a response to  the  downward exchange  rate--2/12-13/85

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  I think there  is  something to  be  said  forwhat  we've  done  so  far.  Yes,  it  would  be  better  if we  could  operateeffectively;  but  after  a long time  of  doing virtually nothing  we'venow taken  a few  small,  modest  steps.  It  seems  to  me that  that'ssomething one  could  build  on.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I can  see  the  essay  now:  "In  Defense  ofIneffectiveness."

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  before you  become  effective you have  tobe  ineffective.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I will  accept that.  You  just  gave  therationale  for  what  we've  been  doing:  We  have  to  go  through this  periodof  ineffectiveness.  Would  you  like  to  ratify  these ineffectivetransactions?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So  moved.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Without  objection.  Mr.  Sternlight.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How much  of  [the  $6 billion  leewayauthorized  for  the  intermeeting period]  did  you use?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  At  the  maximum, $4.4  billion.  It  wound  upat  just  $4.3  billion,  but  we  had  so  much uncertainty,  particularlyabout  what  was  going  to  happen to  Continental's  borrowing,  that  Ithink  it  was useful  to  have  that  flexibility  during  the  period.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any comments?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Do  you mean  on  the  [leeway]  recommendation  [oron  his  report]?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Either  one.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I wanted  to  ask a question  of Peter.Perhaps  everybody else  in  the  room knows  this,  but  I don't.  Early  onyou were  talking  about  how you were  running  compared  with thenonborrowed  reserve  path  and  you  said  that  at  year-end  you were  $300million  above  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  But  then  later you  came  closer  to  thenonborrowed  reserve  path.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Now, does that  mean that  the path  called  for  a35%  increase?  We've  had  a very  large  increase  in  nonborrowedreserves.  Or  does  it  mean  that  you  adjust that  path week by  week?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  The  path  gets  adjusted  as  we  proceed.2/12-13/85

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  So,  unless  we  know what  the  adjustments  are,  wedon't  really  know what  [unintelligible]  an operation.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  The  guiding  principle  in  drawing  the path  isto  accommodate  required  reserves  and  the  estimated  demand  for  excessreserves  and  then the  allowance for  borrowings  that  comes  out  of theCommittee's  discussion.  And  if,  as  we  proceed  through a period,  wefind  that  required  reserves  are  growing more  substantially, we  foldthat  information--when  we  get  it--into  a revision  of  the path.  Mostof  those  revisions--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  So,  if you  have  strong monetary  growth, you'llraise the  path?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Okay.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Unless  we  increase borrowings.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I understood  him to  say  that  it  will  raisethe  path.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [Unintelligible.]

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  That  would have  been  an  alternative  andcould  come  into  the  discussion also.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I just  thought  somebody might  misinterpretit  when you  said you  came  so  close  to  path.  One  needs to  understandthat  you're  constantly  revising that  for  the  larger  growth  [inrequired  reserves],  because  otherwise  one  would  think you wereshooting  for  a very  large  rise  in  nonborrowed  reserves.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Well,  we're  shooting to  accommodate  requiredreserves--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Whatever  is  called  for.

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  --at  that  level  of borrowing.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  On the  [leeway]  recommendation:  I have noproblem with  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Any  other  comments?

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  I just  have  a question.  Hearing your  commentsafter hearing Sam's,  I wondered:  How much  coordination is  therebetween  the two--[the  foreign and  the  domestic  operations]?  I heardyou  talk about  tilting,  which  would  lead  to  a higher  fed  funds  rateetc.,  and  yet  I heard  [Sam talk]  about  the  problems  of the  dollar  andhow when  rates  ticked up  the--

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  Well,  there's  close  coordination in  theoperational  sense  of  Sam and  his  people  being aware  of what  we'redoing  each  day  and vice  versa.  And  on  something  like the  drawing  ofthe  paths--whether we're  talking about  up  to  $300  million with  a biason the  accommodative  side  or  later modifying that  bias--that  is  all2/12-13/85coordinated  through  conversations  with  senior  staff here  and  ensuingdiscussions  that  keep the  Board informed.  Certainly, we  are  keepingthe  Committee informed  in  our  reports  on the  market:  the morning calland  the  weekly  reports.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  I guess  what  I'm  saying  is:  If,  as  you  saw thefed  funds  rate  tick up  you  also  saw a  rather  immediate impact  in theforeign  exchange markets,  if we're  concerned about  a super  dollar  andwe're concerned  about  whether  or  not  we're  intervening  enough,  I justwondered if we  ever  close  the  loop  or  get  any feedback in  here?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Well,  certainly we  were  aware  of what  washappening day-to-day  on the  dollar.  And  there were  some  individualdays  when the  strength  of the  dollar had  a fair  input  into  the  timingof our  operations--the  decision of just  when to  go  in  to  put  reservesinto  the  domestic market.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  But  it  never made  you think that  it  might  beinappropriate  to  allow the  fed  funds  rate  to  continue  to move  upward?

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  No.  I think that  we  did have  some  concernabout what  was  happening when  funds were  getting  up  to  8-1/2  to  8-3/4percent,  and we  [began]  shaping  our  operations  in  a way that  I thinkhelped  to  bring  it  down  to  8-1/4  percent,  though  I wouldn't  say  thatthat  was  specifically  a target.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  is  not  a complete  answer,  but  thedomestic  operation is  very  inflexible.  They  operate--

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  I'm just  trying  to  educate  myself.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  a good  question.  But  [in  thedomestic  market,  generally]  we  operate  at  11:30  to  11:45  a.m.  Once  wehave made that  decision  [after  the morning  call],  it's  over.  It's  arevolution  if we  operate  at  2:30  in the  afternoon because  at  thatpoint  if  the market  sees  the  funds  rate  going  up,  that  raisesquestions  about  whether we're  pegging  the  funds  rate.  So,  it's  aperfectly  reasonable  question.  But  the  fact  is  that  the  opportunities--just  on  an operational  basis--during the  day to  take  account  of[exchange  market  developments]  are  limited.  If we  miss  it  becauseit.  Now, maybe that's  not  the way we  should operate,  but  that  is  theway we  do  operate.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  If  we  have  a money  supply target  and  at  any  onetime  in  any  one  day we  don't  act--in  order  not  to  drive up  the  fundsrate  because  of what  that  might  do  to  the dollar--then  that  has to  bemade  up  some  other  day.  Otherwise, we  miss  our  target  and  it  may thenmean a  larger funds  rate  increase  than  if we  had  done  it  right  away.We  can't  tell  in  advance.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We may  also  find  out  after  the fact  thatit  wasn't  necessary to  operate  that day  at  all  because  the  forecasthas  changed.  That's  not  unusual;  I suppose  there's  a 50-50  chance  ofthat.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  If  there were  any  systematic  effort,as  opposed  to  these  issues  of finesse,  to  place more direct2/12-13/85significance,  say,  to  the  exchange  rate  in  terms  of Peter's  day-to-dayoperations,  I think that's  the  Committee's  decision,  not  Peter's--withall  due  respect  to  Peter.  I think  there  is  room  for  the finessefactor  from time  to  time,  and  I think  he  uses  it.  But  I interpretyour  question  as  being  a little  more  fundamental than  that.  I thinkif it's  a more  fundamental  question  like that,  that's  a  decision wehave  to make,  not  him.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  Just  hearing  the  one  presentation  following  onthe  heels  of the  other  made me  connect  the  two.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  A  very  good  question.  Are  there  any othercomments?  If not,  do  we  have  a motion  on this  [intermeeting]  limit?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So  moved.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without  objection.  We  need  to  ratifythese  transactions.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Move  to  ratify.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No  objection.  Mr. Kichline.

[SECTION]

MESSRS.  KICHLINE, PRELL  and  TRUMAN.  [Statements--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm puzzled  here.  In  July  we  projected  areal  GNP  increase,  4th  quarter  to  4th  quarter,  of  3 to  3-1/4  percent?

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  That  is  correct--for  1985.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Oh,  for  1985!  Well,  now is  the  time tocomment  on  the  business  and  price  situation.  Governor Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  You have  a near  doubling--well,  maybe  not  quitea doubling--of unit  labor  costs  but  very  little  increase in  [the  rateof]  inflation.  Is  that the  effect  of  offsetting  factors?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Governor Wallich,  the  unit  labor  cost  increaselast  year was  2 percent  and,  as  I said,  goes  to  3-1/4  percent  and  thento  about  3-1/2  percent  next  year.  A  quick inspection of  that  chartindicates  that  there  has  been  a very  large  gap  between price  increasesand  unit  labor  cost  increases  over  the past  couple  of years.  Theincrease  in markup  that has  occurred  is  extraordinary  in historicalterms;  and  we're basically  just  seeing  a narrowing  of this  gap  in theperiod  ahead.  The  unit  labor  cost  [increases]  will  still  be  running  alittle  lower  than the  price  increases.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Let  me  ask you  a question  following  thatquestion.  In  terms  of these  projections,  we  center  on 4 percent  forprices  this  year, which  is  an  increase  in the  rate  of price  increasefrom  last year.  I get  a little  concerned  about  presenting  price[projections]  of  an  increasing rate  of price  increase--which  show agreat  faith  in  Federal  Reserve  policy--particularly when  it's  notclear  to me  why  that  should be.  You have  this  decline  in  the  dollarin your  projection--I'm not  talking  about  your  projection;  basically,2/12-13/85I'm talking  about  other  peoples'  projections--but  I don't  know whetherpeople  assumed  a decline in  the dollar.  Last  time  we  used theconvention  that  we would  not;  I think we  assumed  some  general  range  offluctuation within historical  experience,  which  seems  to  me  areasonable  convention.  It  turned out  to  be  a lot  better, because  thedollar was  up,  than  if  we'd  assumed a depreciation.  The  actual  priceresults  have  been  at  the  very  lower  edge  of  our  projections.  And  Iwonder why  we're  so  pessimistic  on  prices this  coming year  when thewage  trend  looks  good,  the  dollar  continues  to  appreciate,  the  profitrate  doesn't  go  down much.  One  can  argue  about  productivity;  thestaff doesn't have  terribly buoyant  productivity  estimates  and  maybeeverybody else  is  very  low on  productivity.  But  I would  like  to  hearwhy  [people  think]  prices  are  going  to be  worse this  year  than  lastyear.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  it's  very  little.  I have  a 4 percentprojection  and  I guess  I would  say it's  a much  better projection  thanI had  at  midyear for  this  year.  There's  only  so  far  you can  go!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Your  philosophy  is  to  catch up  to  realityslowly.

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I also would  be  inclined  to  think thatthis  rise  in unit  labor  costs  will  have more  effect  on  GDBP--pushingit  up  a little--than is  shown  in  this  chart.  I don't  think I wouldhave  allowed  for that  kind  of compression  in  the  difference betweenunit  labor  costs  and  GDBP  and  I did  have  in mind  some  kind  of  a

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Apart  from the decline  in  the  dollar,  Ipresume  over a long period  of  time unit  labor  costs  go  up  the  same  asprices.

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  I think the  relationship  is  quite  closelyconnected.  I would  say  also,  in  response to  Governor Wallich, thatour  general view in  looking  at  the  price  situation  is  that  one wouldtake  some  standard measure  of  productivity and,  in  a sense,  assume  athat the  cyclical  gains  that  you  get  early on  are  rather  quicklytranslated  into  additional  profits.  But  this  rise that  we  see  in  unitlabor  costs  we  would not  translate  immediately into  an  attempt  bycorporations to  add  on  to  that;  rather,  they would  be  taking  a longer-term view.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  At  lower  profits?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Not  a lower  profit.  There's  no  [change]in margins.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Lower than  if  they  priced higher.  We  had moreinflation with the  same  unit  labor  cost.  We  also had more  profit,  butwe  have to  stick  that  income  somewhere.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  My  own  interpretation  of the  priceforecasts,  looking at  the  range of  forecasts  as  well  as  my own,  is2/12-13/85-10-that  I consider  them basically  unchanged.  If  you look  at  the  deflatoron  a fixed-weight  basis,  excluding  food  and  energy,  for  the fourquarters  ending  in  1984  and  the four  quarters  ending  in  1985,  it'sbasically  4 percent  in  both years.  And  when you  look at  1985  asopposed  to  1984,  ending up  with the  same  rate  of  inflation  is  betterin  some  sense  because,  if the  economy  behaves  like the  forecast,  Ithink we're  going to  have  at  least  some  pressures  from commodityprices  over  the  next year.  The dollar  certainly  isn't  going tocontinue  to  go  up;  it  probably will  go  down.  But  even  if  it  stays  thesame,  people  are  not  going  to  buy as  much and  we  will  get  some  furtherpressure  on  a year-over-year basis  from unit  labor  costs.  But  Ipersonally  don't  interpret the  forecast  as  saying  that  inflation  isworse  in  1985  than  in  1984.  It  is  either  about  the  same  or  maybe alittle better.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm going  to  have  a heck of  a timeexplaining to  the  Congress  that  a number  that  goes  up  is  reallyessentially  the  same  or  a little  lower!

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Tell  them that  it  usually  goes  up  quite  a bitmore  in  the  third  year  of  an  expansion.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  In  the third  year of an  expansion  that's  reallynot  much  of  an  increase.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm not  sure  as  far  as  third  years  ofexpansions  are  concerned,  but  I don't  see  where we  get  any  increase.I don't  see  why we  don't  have  a decrease here, with  what  I see  goingon.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I support the  decrease-to-constant  hypothesis,Mr.  Chairman.  We  increased  capacity by  over  3 percent  last  year;there has  been  a surprising  rehiring  of  experienced  labor;  and  thereis  all  of  this  talk that we  heard  earlier  about  the  use  of  computersand  telecommunications  equipment  and  all  that  stuff that  made up  theinvestment  boomlet.  Surely,  these  organizations  are  going to  dosomething with  this  equipment  other  than  look  at  it  and  display it  tovisitors--which  are  two  of  the functions  of this  sort  of  newequipment.  It  seems  to me  that they will  still  have  the  pressure  fromforeign  competition  and  that  finally  someday,  somehow, sooner  orlater,  the  slimming  down  of many  organizations  that  occurred--as  thecharm  school middle managers  were  sent  on  their way  and  otheradjustments  were made  in  management  and  staff  ranks--is  going to  havesome  effect  on  labor  costs  in  a positive direction.  My  own personalprojection was  for  less  inflation--someone  has  to  be  an  outlier--in1985,  and  I would  support  your  statement  of a  constant  or  declining[rate  of  inflation].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't want  to  get  the whole  conversationgoing  on this  point.  I think you might  look  at  it  again  in  the  lightof  an unchanged  dollar  assumption.  Not  as  much  as  a lot  of  otherpeople,  but  we  have  been high  on  our  inflation  estimates  before.  Idon't know what  prices  are  going  to  be,  but  there  certainly  will be  arange  of  uncertainty.  Maybe  they will  go  up.  The  question  is  wherethe  greater  probability  lies.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Could  I ask  a question  on  that?  The  greaterprobability  is  the  number  on  a skewed  distribution.  Presumably,  the2/12-13/85-11-probability  distribution of  inflation  is  that  it  can't  go  much  belowzero but  it  can  go  up  quite  far;  it  has  a long  right  hand  tail.  Areyou thinking in  terms  of the mode--the most  likely  single  value--orthe mean,  including the tail?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  We  have  alleged  for years  that  we have  a modalforecast.  I would  say that  it's  very  difficult,  but  basically, if  weuse  the  model  and  try to  come  out  with confidence  intervals,  the modelcomes  out  with substantially  lower  rates  of  inflation.  In  fact,  ifyou  put  a 70  percent  confidence  interval  around  our  deflator  estimate,a couple  of times  we  drift  out  of  that  range  on  the  high side.  Sowith  the  same  policy assumptions  for  1985,  the model  forecast,  forwhatever it's  worth, is  a rate  of  increase  in the  deflator onepercentage  point  less  than  in  the  staff  forecast.  I view thatinformation as  saying  that the  risks  tend  to  be  skewed  on  the  downside.  We think 3-1/2  percent  is  the  most  likely  outcome;  but  if we'rewrong,  I'd  say  we're probably too high  rather than too  low.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  I have  a couple  of  questions,  Mr.  Chairman.  Twoof the most  difficult  things  to  forecast,  as  you  know, are what  willhappen with  the  Federal  deficit and  what  will  happen to  the dollar.  Iwas  just wondering  if you  did  any  sensitivity analysis  in  terms  ofalternate  forecasts,  supposing that  there's  no  depreciation of  thedollar  and  supposing that  there's no  action  to  reduce the  Federaldeficit.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Ted,  I don't  know if we  can  run  one  with theexchange  rate unchanged.  You have  some numbers  on that  there.  We  dorun  one  that  has  a fiscal  assumption  of no  fiscal  action  at  all,  sothat  would  add  $50  billion  dollars,  essentially, to  outlays:  $40billion  in  outlays  and  $10  billion of  less taxes.  In  1986,  which  isthe  relevant  year  because we  assume  these  fiscal  actions take  effectin  1986  and  beyond, we  get  something  like  1-1/4  to  1-1/2  percenthigher  real  GNP--in the  neighborhood  of 4 percent  or  a little  higher.The  deflator  in  1986  is  only  up  a tenth or  two  but the  momentum buildsas  you  get  into  1987  and  beyond.  Short-term  interest  rates  in thatscenario  are  about  a percentage  point  higher in  1986  than those  in  thestaff  forecast.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  On the  dollar,  taking  not  the  fourth-quarterlevel  but  the  estimate  for  the  first  quarter--which is  a good  deallower than  we  are  now--as  the  jumping-off  point,  we  don't  get  too  muchdirect  impact  on  either  real  GNP  or  prices  from  an unchanged  dollar,since that  [decline]  is  behind  us.  In  the 3rd  quarter,  we  get  0.2down  in  each  and  then  next year  we would  get  a larger impact  of  twicethat  magnitude--an  additional  0.4.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  I wanted to  ask  a question  about  the  debt  todisposable  income  ratio.  Your  chart  shows  that  ratio moving up  prettyrapidly;  it's  probably near  or  a bit  above  the  1979  high.  Do we  knowwhat  accounts  for  this  run-up  in  debt?  Is  it  due  to  demographicforces  or  what  really accounts  for  it?  And  if that  debt  ratio  staysat  about  the  same  level  or  goes  up,  do  you think it's  going to  put  aconstraint  on  spending  in  1985?2/12-13/85-12-

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Well,  we've  been  investing  some  special  effortlately  in trying to  explain the  behavior  of debt.  The  majoringredient  here  is  the  consumer  installment  credit;  its  growthrelative to  income has  been so  sharp  over the  past  couple  of  years.There  are  a number  of  factors  that  seem  to be  at  work.  One,  as  Imentioned,  is  that  durable  goods  spending  has  been  exceptionallystrong,  and  that  presumably is  an  area  of  spending that  is  relativelydebt  intensive.  Another  factor  is  a  rather mechanical  one:  For  a yearor  two  after  the  period  of  credit  controls,  people  seemed  to be  quitereluctant  to  use  debt.  [Credit]  extensions  during that  period  weredepressed  and  it  takes  a while  for  the higher  level  of  extensionssubsequently to  leave  its  full  imprint  on  the  repayment  flows.  Rightnow,  and  over the  past  couple  of  years,  we've had  a  relatively  lowrepayment  flow  from these  past  extensions,  though we  have a higherlevel  of  extensions  currently.  And  as  I indicated,  in  our  projectionwe're  expecting  a catch-up  as  the more  recent  debt  is  what  is  mostlyreflected  in the  repayment  flow.  There may be  some demographiccharacteristics  involved  here.  Clearly,  over the  postwar  period  asthe  population has  aged,  the younger  generations have  been moreinclined to  use  debt.  There's  some  evidence  of  that  over  time  andthere  are  a number  of  other minor  factors.  But  this mechanical matterof extensions  and  repayments  alone,  according to  some  simulations  wedid,  seems  to  explain  a great  deal  of  that  debt  growth.  We  don't  havedata  anymore  on  extensions  or  repayments,  but  our  inference  would bethat  a fairly normal  pattern  of debt  usage  relative  to  the  spendingthat  has  occurred  would have  produced  this  acceleration  and  shouldalso  produce  a marked deceleration.  As  to whether  it  imposes  aconstraint,  the  logic  would  suggest that  those  individuals  who  havedrawn  upon  their  credit  lines  and  so  on  and  built  up  some  debt  mayhave  some marginal  constraint  on  their  further  spending.  But  this  isa widely distributed  debt.  The evidence  is  that  over  the  past  severalyears  it  has  been people  in  higher income brackets  that  have  taken onmost  of  this  additional  debt.  They  presumably have  more  flexibilityand  probably have  more  assets,  so  it  should be  only a limitedconstraint.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor Martin.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I wanted  to  take exception  to  the[projections  for]  housing  starts  and  residential  construction volumefor  1985.  As  the  chart  showed,  the mortgage commitment  rate  ishovering around  13  percent  on  a 30-year  fixed-rate  loan  and  theproportion of  adjustable  rate  loans  has  dropped  significantly.  Idon't  believe,  given the  satisfaction  of  the  deferred housing  demandthat  has  occurred  to  date,  that  we  can  reach  1.75  million  [in  housingstarts]  or  $166+  billion in  residential  investment  in  1985.  It  couldhappen with  a lower  [mortgage]  rate but  the  assumption  of the  staff  isfor  somewhat  higher  rates,  particularly  toward the  end  of  the year.In  the models  I've  seen,  it  would  take  a fixed-rate  somewhere  around12-1/2  percent.  If  you add  the  servicing  on  to  that mortgagecommitment  rate  for  30-year  fixed-rate loans  you  get  about  13-1/4percent.  So  it  seems  to me  that we're  looking at  1.5  million  ratherthan  1.75  million  [on  starts].There  are  a number  of  other  institutional  changes.  We  knowthat  the  investigation  of  the  Bank of  America mortgage-backed  securityfraud  situation  is  only beginning.  There will  be  some  investorreaction  in  the  mortgage-backed  security  area.  The  thrift  institution2/12-13/85-13-regulators  are  attempting to  slow the  growth  [of  such  securities],  andto  the  extent  that  there  is  some  degree  of  success,  that would  affectavailability.  And  finally, there  is  the  so-called willingness  factorin home  buying that  is  disappearing,  in  the  sense  that  theappreciation motivation that  has  been  so  prominent  over the  lastseveral  decades  is  waning  in  several  regions  of the  country.  Themotivation to  buy  is  for  shelter and  not  for  appreciation.  Thesyndicates have  been  pushed  out  of  the market  in  the  multifamily area;the multiple unit  vacancy  rate  is  terrifically high  in  some  parts  ofthe  country.  It  isn't  enough  to  do  a macro  job  and  get  this  very  highvacancy  shown  on the  chart.  For  the  United States  there  isn't  anational  housing market;  there  is  mosaic  of sub-markets  around  thecountry;  and many  of those have  very,  very high  vacancy  rates.  So  Idon't  see  how we  can get  600,000  or  650,000  in multifamily  starts  in1985.  I suggest  that  the  forecast  is  [.25  million]  high.  Thatdoesn't  exactly throw the  forecast  out.I would  couple that  remark with a commendation  for  theanalysis  in the  rest  of the  structural  forecast  for  the next  year  interms  of  real  business  fixed  investment.  I think it's  a very  goodanalysis,  showing a very big  cutback in  structures  in  the  realbusiness  fixed investment  area.  I did  a little  work prior to  themeeting  and  then  found  that  I was  caught  in  the  sense  that  I was  onlyverifying what  the  staff has  done  here.  I think that's  quiteaccurate.

MR. KEEHN.  On  the business  fixed  investment  chart  I continueto  be  amazed  by this  very  favorable  red  trend  line  that we've  watchedthe  last  couple  of years,  which  seems  completely  out  of  context  withour  experience.  Mike,  I think you did  comment as  you went  through thecharts  that  most  of  that  line,  or  a significant  part  of  it,  is  in thecommunications/computer  area.  My  question  is:  If  you were  to  separateout  what  I would  call  for  lack  of  a better  term the  "grunt  stuff"--theheavy  capital  production type  of equipment--from  the  computer  area  andthen,  in turn, take  a look  at  the  part of  that  heavy  equipment that  isbeing  supplied  by the  international market,  wouldn't  the  line  in  factbe  very,  very  different?  And wouldn't  that  be  a way  of dramatizinghow terribly uneven  all  of  this  is,  despite the  fact  that  we  have  atrend  line that  looks  very  favorable?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well,  I confess  I have  not  done the  calculationfor the  residual  component  of producers'  durable  goods.  It's  a verylogical  concept;  I wish  I had done  it.  This  aggregate here  includesoffice and  store machinery, communication  equipment,  scientificengineering  equipment,  and  photographic  equipment.  It  is  a prettygood  piece--almost half--of producers'  durable  equipment.  My  sense  isthat  if you  looked  at  the  rest  of the  numbers,  you  would  see  a muchmore  moderate  advance.  But  as  things  progressed  last  year,  we  did  seesome  fairly  substantial  increases  in  the  heavy machinery  area  and  soon.  There  is  the  distinction  between production  and  purchase  of thisequipment.  Clearly, the  share  of  equipment  sales  that  is  going  toforeign  producers  has  increased very  considerably.  So  the  implicationfor  domestic  firms  and  the  capital  goods  industry  is  one  that  is  notquite  as  rosy  as  this  picture.

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Are you  ready  for more  general

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I am.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Let  me make  a  couple  of more  generalcomments.  Our  own  view of  the economy  for  1985  is  one  that has  realGNP  growing  about  4 percent,  with the deflator  a shade  lower thanthat.  And  at  this  juncture,  that  has  the  characteristics  of  a goodforecast  from my  perspective.  In  the  short  run  it  could  actually  be  abit  stronger.  The  impression  I get  from talking  to  business  peopleand  others  over  the  past  month or  so  is  that  most  of them have  beeninflation  projection for  the  year.  But  I think there  probably  is  aconsensus  somewhere  in  the  3-1/2  to  4 percent  range  for  both  real  GNPand  prices.On  the  point  that was  just  brought  up,  the  feeling  comes  outvery, very  forcefully  in  comments  from directors  and  business  leadersthat we  have  crossed  the Rubicon  on  this  external  stuff  and that  itFor  example, who  represents  a very,  very  largemultinational  firm heavy  in  capital  goods,  thinks  that  in  recentquarters  100  percent  of  the  increase  in  spending  on  equipment  iscoming  from  abroad.  Just  within the  past week he  made  some  commentsto  the  effect  that  he  had  seen his  order  book affected  in  a verysizable  way  just  in the  past  month because  of the  international  tradesituation.  So,  that  continues  to  be  a wild  card  and  it's  gettingwilder  by the minute.  I have  some  of  the  same  concerns  that  Pres  had2/12-13/85-15-about  the housing  sector.  It  should  be  a good  year,  but  there  aresome  things  in  there  that  I find  troubling as  well.Extracting from  the traditional  sectoral  questions  of whatthe  risks  are  to  a forecast,  it  seems  to me  that  there  are two  orthree more  generic  risks  that  are  particularly  important in  thecurrent  setting.  One  of  those  is:  What  happens  if  interest  rates  goup  in any  appreciable way?  Let me  just  define  appreciable as  morethan  a percentage  point  in  the  short  run.  Obviously, that  would be  avery  difficult  situation.  And then  you ask yourself:  What  couldproduce  that?  If the  budget  deficit  is  not  reduced, that  couldproduce  it;  and  if the  dollar  declines  in any  appreciable way, thatcould  produce  it  even  though  the  cushion  for  a dollar  decline  issomewhat larger  now than  it  was before.  That  result  could  also  comefrom the economy  growing too  fast  because,  from my  perspective  atleast,  the  balance  in  our  credit  markets  is  so  precarious,  asindicated  in  one  of Mike's  charts,  that  it  doesn't  take much to  pushus  into  a situation  in which the  economy  is  growing  too  fast.  Eventhough  that  might  not  reflect  itself  in  price  pressures,  it  couldeasily  be  reflected  in  interest  rate  pressures.  Then,  of course,there  is  always  the possibility--perhaps  remote  at  the moment--thatthe  market  could  conclude  that money  growth in  some  broad  sense  isgetting  away from us.  So,  there  is  a whole  collection  of things,  anyone  of which  I think  could  produce  pressures  on  interest  rates.  And  Ithink  it  goes  without  saying that  any  appreciable pressures  in  thatdirection would  throw any  forecast to  the wind.Another  thing  that  I am  somewhat  concerned  about  in terms  ofrisks  is  the  burden  of  all  this  debt  we're  accumulating.  I'm not  assanguine  as  I thought  you  seemed to  be,  Mike,  in  terms  of thecumulative  effect  of that  debt burden--particularly in  the  context  ofwhat  I think is  still  some  fragility  in  the  financial  system.  And  Idon't  think  all  of these  crazy new markets  and  instruments  that  arecoming  along almost  daily  are helping  that  situation.  Just  to  putthat  debt  situation  in  one  perspective:  Since  1982,  the  ratio  ofnonfinancial  debt  to  nominal  GNP  has  risen by  17  [hundredths]. almost  a vertical  line,  and  the  level  of that  debt  right  now is  so  farout  of  line  with anything we've  ever  experienced.  That's  just  anotherway  of  looking  at  it  that  is  troubling.It'sThe  last  thing  I would mention on  the  risk  side  is  the  oilprice;  that  has  been  talked  about  a little.  I was  surprised  the otherday  when a point  was made  to  me  in  a conversation with  someone  Iregard  as  a  fairly  credible  source.  The  nature  of the  comment wasthat  among  a  group  of  people  thought  to  be  experts,  a third  of themnow thought  there  was  at  least  some  possibility  that  the  oil  pricecould  fall,  say,  to  the  $16  range.  No  one  was  predicting  that  as  ahard  prediction, but  there  was  at  least  the  recognition  of that  as  apossibility by  a  fairly knowledgeable  and  sizable  group  of  so-calledexperts.  I must  say when  I stop  and try  to  think  about  theimplications  of  that,  I'm not  sure  what  they  are.  They  probably,  ormost  certainly,  are  not  good.  So,  in  general,  I come  out  with  [theview  that]  everybody is  feeling  good  about  the  situation right  now  butgetting  a little more worried  about what  the  situation implies  downthe  road.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  --more worried  as  you talked!  GovernorGramley.2/12-13/85-16-

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Well,  I think  the  forecast  in many  respects  isa  remarkably good  one  for  the  third year  of  a recovery--when  growth  inthe  first  two years  was well  above  the  average  for  the  first  two  yearsof  recovery  and  in  the third  year the  expansion  is  sustained  at  a ratewell  above  potential  growth  and  unemployment  is  reduced while  keepinga low  inflation  rate  and  relatively stable  interest  rates.  As  Irecall--and  I didn't  look  this  up--this  forecast  for  '85  is  notdramatically  different  than what  the  staff presented  for  '85  a yearago  and  I swore  then that  it  couldn't  happen.  But we're  here  now and,if you  look at  outside  forecasts,  a very large  number  of them  arecentering on  performance  very  much like  this  one.  Indeed,  when  I putin my  forecast,  I found myself  putting  in numbers  very much  like whatthe  staff has  here.In  thinking  about  uncertainties,  what  worries  me  the most  iswhat's  going to  happen  to  the  dollar.  Lots  of  people  worry aboutthat,  too.  Oddly  enough,  some  people  say  if the  dollar  goes  up,  thatwill  be bad  for  the  economy  and when  you  ask  them what  will  happen  ifthe  dollar  goes  down, they  say that  will be  bad  for  the  economy, too.There  are  some  bad  things  and  some  good  things,  but  we  need  to  keepstraight  exactly what  is  going to  happen  if  either  of those  twooutcomes  occurs.  I worry more--a  lot more--about  what's  going tohappen  when  and  if the  dollar  begins  to  fall  than if it  rises  further.If  it  rises  further,  it  will  put  some  additional  restraint  on thegrowth  of  domestic  production but  it  will  have  beneficial  effects  onthe  inflation  rate  and beneficial  effects  on  interest  rates.  And  Ithink  it  is  not  too  difficult  to  handle  the negative  aspects  ondomestic  growth by  adjustments of  monetary  policy,  even  though  I amworried  about  the  kind  of  protectionist measures  that  develop  [inthose  circumstances].  If  the  dollar  begins  to  go  down  and  go  downrapidly,  particularly  [unintelligible]  as  we're  approaching  thenatural  rate  of unemployment,  it's  going  to  stimulate the  economystrongly.  It's  going to  put  strong upward  pressures  on  prices  and,through both  of those  things,  strong  upward  pressures  on  interestrates.  And  that  we're  going  to  have  a lot  of  problems  with.  So,  Ihope the  staff is  right  and  we  begin  to  get  a modest  gradual  declineof the  dollar  beginning fairly  soon.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Sounds  like  one  of the  least  likelyforecasts--not  that  anybody has  any better  one.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  Just  to  comment  generally on  the  outlook, thestaff  forecast  is  really  quite  consistent  with ours.  Our  GNP  is  alittle  lower  and  our  inflation  is  a  little higher  but not materiallyenough  to  comment  on.  But,  as  you  can  gather by  my earlier  comments,I am  still  just  staggered by  the  continuing unevenness  of it  all.Many  of  the  industries  on  the  capital  goods  side  are very weak and  Ithink  a lot  of  them have  come  to  the  conclusion  that they  are  going tobe  left  out  and  that  this  recovery  is  going  to  completely  pass  themby.  I was  talking  with  a man  who  runs  a very  large  diversifiedcompany,  including  an  extensive foundry  operation,  and  they haveconcluded that  they had better  get  ready  for  the  next  recession  andnow  are  in the  process  of  closing  permanently  about  half  of theirfoundries.  They just  feel  that  that  business  is  never  going to  comeback.A  risk  I would  point  out--and  I would  say  it's  a local  risk,certainly  not  a macro  or  a broad  risk--is  this  agricultural  situation.2/12-13/85-17-I almost  don't  dare mention  it  because  I'm  sure  I can't  say  anythingnew or  surprising  and  you've  heard a lot  about  it.  But  it  is  veryserious  and  is  continuing to  deteriorate.  And  it  is  one that  I findvery  hard  to  get  a handle on;  I find  it  difficult to  measure  just  howdifficult  and  serious  the  problem  is  other  than  I have  a hunch  thatthe  statistics we  look  at  really don't  adequately describe  theproblem.  The  land  surveys  that  we  look  at  suggest  that  land valuesare  down  30  to  40  percent  from the  peak.  But  there  isn't much  landselling;  and  when  land does  sell,  it's  selling  at  50  to  60  percentunder the  peak.  People  purposely  are  trying to  hold  land  off theAs  the  land value  goes  down,  the debt  [unintelligible]  willget  very, very  high  at  the  agricultural banks.  Cash  flow  just  isn'tgoing to  be  adequate  to  service  the debt.  The  concern  among the  agbanks  is  getting very  high.  I went  to the  Iowa  bankers meeting inSioux  City  last  weekend  and  I was  pleased to  get  out  of town  in  onepiece!  They  are  pretty  close-mouthed about  the  problem but  they allcan  see  that  the losses  are  going  to  be  very  substantial when theytotal  the direct  loans  to  the  farmers  and  the  indirect  loans  tosuppliers  and  merchants  and the  like.  Also  in  the Midwest  there hasbeen  a lot  of this  trading  of banks  around that  is  supported  by  loanson  bank  stock, and  I have  a hunch  that that  will  be  a problem  that'sgoing  to  grow  in magnitude.  When  you add  those  together,  I think thelosses  on  the portfolios  are  going to  be very  substantial.  Anotherway  of  saying that  the  numbers  hide the  nature  of the  problem  a littleis  this:  Of  the  530  state  banks  in  Iowa  only  15  have  capital  of  7percent  or  less;  and  of those  15,  12  are between  6 and  7 percent,which would  suggest  that there  isn't  a problem  from  a capital  point  ofview.  But  when  asset  quality  problems  arise,  a bank  can  go  throughcapital  awfully darn  fast  and  all  of  a sudden there  is  an  escalatingproblem.  The  Superintendent  of  Banks  in  Iowa  suggests  that  about  140of their  530 banks  are  what  he would  call  problem banks  and  by  that  hemeans that  60  percent  of  capital  is  classified.  But  he  thinks  thatnumber  is  going  to  go  up  and  that  by  the  end  of the  year  about  half oftheir banks  will  be  in the  problem  category.  These  are  all,  I think,small  banks  and  this  is  somewhat  of  a regional  problem as  opposed  toone with broad  national  implications.  But  I do  suggest  to  you  thatthis  agricultural  problem--and,  again,  it  can't  be  news  to  you--isserious  and  is  escalating and  that  the  number of bank  failures  isgoing to  be  significantly  higher  in  the Midwest  this  year  than was  thecase  last  year.  It  is  not  at  a level  nor  of the  type  of  institutionthat  could  be  destabilizing, but  I think it  is  a risk that  meritsnotice.

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I've  been  in maybe  a dozen meetings  over  thepast  month and  I think this  is  the  gloomiest  couple of  hours  I'vespent!  Actually,  the  forecast  looks  like  a pretty good  forecast  forthe  third year  of  a recovery  and  it  seems  to  me  that  it's  a reasonableforecast.  I think you  can  argue  with  it  in  pieces  but,  at  least  in mypart  of  the  country,  I find the  mood  more upbeat  than  I sense  aroundthe  table.  There  is  a long  list  of things that  could  go  wrong;  eachone  of them,  certainly,  could  go  wrong  and  1985  could  end  up being  adisastrous  year.  But  it  seems  to  me,  if  you're  a betting  person, thatthe  outlook  is  really pretty  good;  and  I don't  see  anything wrong withaccepting a pretty  good  outlook when  it  comes  our way.  Clearly, there2/12-13/85-18-are  risks  with the  dollar  and  there  are  problems with  agriculture  andthere  are  other  areas  of  risk.  But  on the whole  I think maybe theFederal Reserve  ought  to  surprise the  country  and  not  feel  too  badabout  the  outlook in  1985.  So,  I would be  inclined  to  take  theforecast more  or  less  as  it  is,  acknowledge that  things  could  gowrong, but  still  present  an upbeat kind  of outlook.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Miss  Seger.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  First,  in  terms  of the  inflation  outlook, I cameup  with 3-1/2  percent  without taking  into  account the value  of thedollar;  then Ted  Truman convinced me  that  the  dollar is  going  todepreciate  so  eventually  I rounded my number up  to  4 percent.  If  Ihad  assumed  it  was  going  in the  other  direction,  I would have  roundedit  down  to  3 percent  because  I just  do  these  in  whole numbers;  I don'thave  the  confidence that  I can do  it  any  more  finely than that.  Interms  of  productivity--and this  is  something that  I'm very  interestedin--one factor  I think we're  soft  peddling,  if not  ignoring,  in  thiswhole  productivity discussion  is  simply the  commitment  of businessmanagers  to  be more  productive.  I deal  with  some  of the  same  kinds  ofpeople that  Si  Keehn does  out  in  the  Rust  Belt  and  they are  viewingthis  as  a very high  priority item.  It's  shape up  or  you're  going tobe dead;  it's  as  simple  as  that.  Therefore, this  has  given them astrong  incentive to  be  more productive.  I understand that,unfortunately, that  doesn't  fit  very well  into  the  econometric  models,but  that  doesn't mean  it  isn't  a factor  and that  doesn't mean it  isn'ta very  important  factor.  Furthermore,  I think this  notion ties  inwith  what  we're  seeing  in  plant  and  equipment  spending:  that  in  orderto  get  the  kinds  of  productivity  gains  they  feel  they have  to  have  tocompete with the  imports,  they have  to bring  in  state-of-the-artequipment.  I just  saw a plant  on  Friday that  had  robots  all  over  theplace  at  $90,000  per  unit.  It's  not  a small  investment  but  they haveto  do  this  to  improve  their productivity.  I think we're  going to  seemore  and  more  of this  even  in  offices;  maybe  not  in  Washington, but  inother  parts  of the  country they  are having  to be  more  productive.They  are having  to  use  word  processors;  they  are  having  to  stretchclerical  help by  giving them better tools.  I think we  have  to  paymore  attention  to  this  because,  as  Jim said,  it  is  important  withrespect  to  inflation possibilities  and  also to  our  growth potential.Finally,  [I  am concerned  about]  the continuing  strong dollar,the  agricultural  problem that  Si  has  already  referred to,  the  thirdworld  debt  situation--I went  to  a meeting  last week  at  the  StateDepartment  about  the  latter and  that  doesn't  seem to  me to  be  aproblem that  has  gone  away--and the thrifts,  which are  still  hangingon the  edge  of the  cliff.  Looking  at  all  four  of those  factors,  Ifind  it  very  difficult  to  think in terms  of  interest  rates  going anyhigher at  all,  because  I think that would  push  all  of those  problemsinto  a still  more  serious mode.  And heaven  knows  they  are  bad  enough!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Morris.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  I agree with  Ed  Boehne only more  so.  Ithink the  staff is  projecting  a smaller  real  growth  for  1985  thanwe're  going  to  realize.  I put  in  a 4 percent  number and  I thinkthat's  a minimum;  I really think we'll  probably do  better than that  onreal  growth.  It's  hard  for  me  to  document  my position very  well  onthe  basis  of the numbers  that  have  come  in  since  our  last  meeting2/12-13/85-19-because they  are  a fairly mixed  bag.  But  one  thing that  has  impressedme  in the  past  few weeks  has  been  the  extraordinary  strength  in thestock market.  Since  the  9th  of January the  stock market  has  put  on  adisplay  of business  confidence  of a sort  that  is  quite  rare  in  ourhistory.  I think that  we're  going to  be  revising  up  these  real  growthprojections  and  by midyear,  say,  I think  that  is  going  to  put  us  in  avery  difficult  position with  respect  to  the  effects  of  our  actions  oninterest  rates.  So,  it  seems  to  me that  our  problems  in  1985  aregoing  to be  the  problems  of  a very  strong economy  and  they are  goingto  be  just  as  difficult  to  deal  with,  and  perhaps  more  so,  than  theproblems we  would  face  if the  economy  came  in weaker.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Mr.  Chairman, we're  in  fairly  close  agreementwith  the  staff forecast  for  1985  but with  a couple  of  differentassumptions.  One  is  that we  [keyed]  off  the  midpoint  of the M1[objective]  and  projected  5-1/2  percent  M1  growth  rather than the6-1/2 percent  that the  staff has,  and  still  came  up  with essentiallythe  same  numbers  with the  exception of the  deflator;  we  would  besomewhere  in the  range  of  about  1/2  percent  higher  on the  deflator.The  higher  deflator  number  fell  out  of the  unit  labor  cost  componentof the  forecast,  suggesting that  unit  labor  costs would  go  up  morethan the  staff has  forecast.  But  in  all  respects,  it  would  seem to  methat  we're  going  to  get  somewhat  greater  growth  than the  staff  isforecasting  in the  first  half of the  year  and  somewhat  less  in  thesecond half,  largely because  of the  interest  rate  pressures  that  willbe  brought  to  bear  because  of that  greater  growth  [in  the first  half]and maybe  some  action  by the  Federal  Reserve  to move  against  that.I would  also  want  to  note  for the  Committee,  as  a follow-upon a comment  of  Si  Keehn,  that  the condition  of the  agriculturalsector  in  the  high  plains  of  the  Midwest  is  a very  serious  problem.It  may  not  have  the national  impact,  much  as  he  has  suggested,  butthat  does  not  mean  that there  will  not  be  great  social  and  otherdisruptions  in  that  area.  And  indeed,  it  could  get  out  of hand.  Iwould also  want  to  note  quickly,  having talked  to  the Farm  Creditpeople,  bankers,  large  input  suppliers to  the  agricultural  sector,  aswell  as  to  some  Congressmen, that  I fairly well  concluded  that  thereis  not  a great  deal  that  monetary policy  can  do  to  alleviate thatproblem,  at  least  in  the  very  near  term--I'm talking  about  1985  andquite likely  1986.  I'm not  sure  that  there  is  a role  for  thisCommittee  with  respect  to  taking  action to  try to  alleviate  theproblem that  rests  in  the  agricultural  sector.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Boykin.

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I'm  inclined  to  join  those who  areprobably a  little more  optimistic than  the Board  staff,  although  Ithink the  staff's  forecast  is  very  reasonable and  I would  be willingto  accept  it.  As  for  concern  about  all  of the  problems,  I feel  muchas  you  did,  Ed:  I felt  very good  until  I got  here.  Those problems  areall  there  and  they  are  all  very  real  possibilities.  I guess  the worstof  all  worlds would  be  if  every  one  of  them really  came  to  pass;  maybejust  one  of them will.  We  will  just  have to  wait  and  see what's  goingto  happen  on  the deficit  problem.  The  dollar  problem is  pretty muchof  an unknown,  and  depending  on  how that  develops--or  if  some  of thesethings  happen--I  think we  would  all  be  shifting  our views  entirely.2/12-13/85-20-On  agriculture,  I tend  to  agree with  Roger:  I really  don't  know whatwe,  sitting  around this  table,  can  do  there.In  the  discussion,  someone  mentioned the  oil  price  going to$16  or  $15  dollars  a barrel.  Several  months  ago,  in  discussing whatthe  effect  would be  on  our  financial  institutions  if we  got  a  prettygood  drop  in the  price  of  oil,  the  feeling was that  if  the price  gotto  $25  a barrel,  that  was  going  to  cause  some  very  serious  problems.Now  that  that  is  a very real  situation,  they  are  saying:  "Well, whenit  gets  to  $20  we're  going  to  have  some  real  problems."  So,  it's  hardto  judge  just where that  level  is.  I don't  believe  it's  quite  asdifficult at  $25  now  as  they  thought  it  was  going to  be--not  that  it'seasy;  it  isn't.  And  now they are  thinking maybe  $20  is  where  thedifficulty  is--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Is  the  price  $25  now?

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  No.  But  I think it's  becoming more  and  more  ofa reality that  it's  going  to  get  there.  Therefore,  in theconversations,  the  assumption is  that  it's  likely to  get  there  so  theyquestion where  the  next  down  point  is.  But  no,  it's not  there  yet.Overall,  looking at  the  situation today,  I would  certainly  go  forwardwith  a great  big smile  on  my  face  and  keep  my fingers  crossed  as  Ikept  going.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I didn't  comment  on  the  generalsituation  earlier  so  let me briefly  do  that  now, if  I may.  First  ofall,  I agree  with  the  staff  forecast;  we  came out  very,  very  close  toit.  The  only minor difference  I would note  is  that,  like  some  others,the  shape  of  1985  looks  a little  different to  us  than  to  the  staff:  wethink there  will  be  greater  growth  in the  first  half than  in thesecond.  But  generally  speaking,  it  is  a reasonable  forecast  and  it'sone  that  I would be  prepared  to  accept  and  one that  I would beprepared  to  base  policy on.In  talking to  people  around my  District,  I sense  that  theconfidence  level  is  very high;  there  is  a good  deal  of  optimism aboutthe  economy.  The  private  forecasters  seem to  be  coming  out  prettymuch  the  same way on  growth  and  inflation.  I, too,  came  to  themeeting  feeling pretty  good;  but  unlike  a few of my  colleagues,  I'mnot  particularly  disturbed  at  what  I'm hearing because  I think thatthese problems  are  real.  They  are  potential  problems  that  I think wehave  to  keep  very clearly  in  mind--not  that  they're  necessarily  allgoing  to  happen,  but  I think we would  [ignore]  those  problems  at  ourperil.  I think they  are very  real.  I am  beginning  to  feel  in  talkingto  some  people  that  there  is  a sense  of  euphoria  beginning to  develop.And,  at  least  in my  small  sample,  people  aren't  even talking  as  muchabout  the  deficit  anymore.  They have  had  in  1984  a very, very  goodyear  of  phenomenal  growth;  they  are  looking  at  good  growth  in  1985;and  these  the problems  of  the  dollar,  the  deficit,  oil  prices,  andagriculture  seem to  be  diminishing  in  people's  minds.  So,  I think wehave  to  be  careful  to  keep  those  problems  very much  in  mind.The  only  other  comment  I would make  is  that  I'm not  so  surethis  agricultural  situation  is  really  a parochial  one  and  not  a macroone.  We  have  it  in  our  District,  so  now we're talking  about  the2/12-13/85-21-Midwest  and  the  Southeast  and  perhaps  the  Southwest.  And  while thebanks  that might  be  affected  are  small,  the  aggregate  of  dislocationamong  the agricultural  banks  could  be  substantial.  Again,  while  I'moptimistic,  I think there  are  some  dangers that  we  have  to  keep  oureye  on;  but  generally  I would  agree with the  staff  forecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Except  in  prices,  where you're much  higheraccording to the--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  We'll  take  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  4.2  percent,  and year-over-year 3.6  percent.I had  it  right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Black.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think  the  staff's  projection  iscertainly plausible  and  we  can't  quarrel  much with  it.  I believe,like  Frank Morris  and  Ed  Boehne and  Bob  Boykin,  that the  risk is  thatthe  economy will  come  in  somewhat  stronger than  that.  Underlyingtheir  forecast  is  the  assumption that  the  income velocity  of M1  isgoing  to  grow  a little more  than  1 percent.  That may well  be  right,but  to  me  that  seems  on  the  low side  of what  is  likely  to  happen.  Iwould  think  it  is  more  likely that  we'll  have  more  growth  in nominalGNP  as  a result  of  a faster  rising velocity,  and  I think  that would  bedistributed  partly between  real  output  and  prices.  So,  we  come  out  at4.4  percent  on  those.  So  far  as  the  unemployment  rate  is  concerned,  Iwouldn't  be  surprised  to  see  that  drop  a bit  lower  than  what  weprojected originally  or  what  the  staff  is  projecting.  I think thedemographics  of the  situation  and  improving  real  family incomes mightwell  limit  the  increase  in  what the  staff is  projecting  for  laborforce  participation  rates  and bring that  down maybe  a couple  of  tenthsof  a percentage  point  below what  they  have.

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.2/12-13/85-22-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I'm inclined  to  agree with  the  optimiststoo.  I think the  short-term outlook  is  pretty  good and  the  staffforecast  is  probably  on the  low end  of what  might  occur  in  the nextyear.  It  has  been  shown  pretty clearly  now that  what  we  had  in  thefall  was  a temporary  stoppage  in  the  growth and  that  growth has  nowresumed  at  a pretty  good  rate.  I have  this  view that  the  outlook  isgood  but  the  underlying situation  is  terrible.  And  the  question  is:Do  we  live  in the  short  run  or  do  we  live  in  the  long  run when  theunderlying  situation may reveal  itself?  I suppose the  greatestproblem  that might  occur would be  a substantial  increase  in interestrates.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I think what you  really mean to  say  is  that  thereal  world  is  fine but  the  financial  world  is  terrible.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  maybe that's  what  I'm  affected by.  Iagree with  Jerry that  a sizable rise  in  interest  rates  would be  quitedifficult  for  these burdened  sectors  to  take  on.  I don't  agree withhim that  a 100  basis  points  is  a sizable  rise.  After  all,  rates  aredown  several hundred  points  over the  last  several  months,  but  I guessI would  agree  that  a 200  basis point  increase  would  be  a verydifficult  thing.  From my vantage  point  right  now,  I'm  beginning tothink our  greatest  problem may be  an  excessive  increase  in  activityhere  that  in  fact will  bring  a 200  basis  point  increase  in  interestrates  looking out  6 months  from  now.  Therefore,  I'm more  on the  sideof those  who  are  now becoming  somewhat  fearful  of  too much  of  a risein  activity  rather  than on  the  side of  those who  think it's  going  tobe  too  small  in the  period  to  come.  In  the  end  all  these  problems  andmore  that  have  been listed  by  Jim and  others  are  going to  come  out  insome  way or  other,  but  I think probably  not  in  1985.

MR. WALLICH.  I think as  one  looks  at  the  evolution  of  ourprojections,  it  has  been very  favorable.  Growth projections  have  beenupgraded  and  inflation  projections have  been  reduced.  I'm a littleuneasy about  the  inflation  projections  but there  are  reasons  for them.When  you take  the  absolute  levels,  the  rate of  growth  is  very  close  towhat  we  might  consider  potential  and  the  rate of  inflation  is  stillway  above what  it  ought  to  be.  The  staff has  it  coming  down  in  apretty  satisfactory way;  I doubt  that  [will  happen]. think there  is  much more  to  be  done  on  that  score.In  any  event,  I

We're  in the  third year  of an  expansion  and  there  isno  reason why expansions  should  come  to  an  end  after  3 years.  Butneither  do  I believe  what  the  [Administration's]  economic  report  says:that  there  is  no  relationship  between the  age  of an  expansion  and  thechances  of  it  coming to  an  end.  So  I think  the  risks,  as  others have2/12-13/85 -23-pointed  out,  are  that  something untoward may  happen  and  may  interferewith  this  reasonably  good  evolution.  We  have  no  serious  imbalancesother  than,  of course,  the  terrible  one--the  budget  deficit.  But  wehave a number  of  danger  points,  mainly  financial.  So,  again,  thereare  potential  sources  of the  evolution being  disturbed.  To  me  thissuggests  that  the  risks  are  more  on the  side  of  excessive  expansionthan  of  going  down  unexpectedly,  and  our  policy  ought  to be[formulated]  accordingly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mrs.  Horn.

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  I think the  staff  forecast  is  a reasonable  one.  Iam impressed with the  year-end  business  statistics,  and  for  thatreason  I agree  with those  around  the  table who  are  optimists  and  whofeel  the odds  favor  a stronger  recovery than the  one  that's  built  intothe  forecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  are  those year-end  figures?

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  Well, we  could start  with the 4th  quarter  GNPnumbers  and  the  auto  numbers  coming in  strong.  One  of the  things  Iwas  worried  about  at  year-end was  the  buildup  in  inventories;  I thinkthat  is  not  so  severe,  based  on  the  variety  of  numbers  that  I see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  On the  other  hand,  I raised  the  questionbecause  new  orders  are  down  and  housing  is  going  no  place  on thelatest  numbers,  and  there  are  real  questions  about  the  commercialconstruction  area.  Who  knows?  The  auto  figure  looked  good,  as  didthe  inventory  reduction.

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  The  whole  personal  consumption  expenditures,  orthe  consumer  side,  [looked  good]  and  I tend  to  I focus  on  that.  Inany  case,  looking at  some  of the  assumptions  that  underlie myforecast--and  I think  a lot  of the  others  around the  table--one  couldbuild  a case  for  consumer  and  business  outlays  becoming  stronger.  Ifyou assume  an  expansive  fiscal  policy,  no  sharp  changes  in  theexchange  rates,  no  abrupt  rise  in  interest  rates,  low  farm prices,even  lower  oil  prices,  and  so  forth,  I think you  can build  a case  fora stronger  recovery  than the  one  that  the  staff is  forecasting,  and  Ithink that's  pretty  close  to  my  forecast.  If the  recovery  isstronger,  then the  question  about  inflation  comes  up.  I would  see  itnot  spilling  into  the  '85  numbers  but  be  a danger  in  '86.  And  that,of  course,  requires  either  fiscal  or  monetary  policy, or  both, to  dealwith  it.In  the Fourth  District,  the  pattern  of  business  activity  issluggish with no  particularly  clear  direction.  But  I can  even  put  anoptimistic  light  on the  Fourth  District  outlook  in that  there  isreally  a distinct  change  in mood,  though  it's  probably short  of  Bob'sterm  "euphoria."  The  impressionistic  evidence  we're  getting  hasreally  quite  a different  tone  to  it.  Of  course,  a  lot  of what  we  hearcomes  from the  strong  auto  numbers  in  both December  and  January, butwe're  getting  a lot  of  other  stories.  We've  had  no  disappointment  inretail  sales  in  January,  for  example.  We've  had unexpected  strengthin  chemical  orders  and,  to  a lesser  degree,  in  both heavy trucks  andsteel  orders  as  well.  This  is  all  recent  and  impressionistic  ratherthan  in  the  numbers.  To  keep  from having  a wholly  optimistic  reportto  the  Committee,  though,  I will  say  that  the talk about  protectionism2/12-13/85 -24-has  increased--if  that's  possible--in the Midwest.  You  can't  get  twobusiness  people  in  the Midwest  together  without that  being  thesubject,  and  I think that's  a terribly  serious  danger  as  we  goforward.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  When  do  the  retail  sales  figures  come  outfor  January?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  8:30  a.m. tomorrow.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You  could  make  a bold  comment  about them.Mr. Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Well,  I want  to  make a  comment  on  the  generaloutlook.  We're  essentially  in  agreement  with the  staff  forecast.  Infact,  our  numbers  are  very  close  except  that  we're  a  little  lower  oninflation.  We  have  3.7  percent,  mainly  because we  only  expect  a 4percent  decline  in  the  dollar  rather  than 8 percent,  but  we  would  onlybe  half as  wrong.  I think  the  staff forecast  is  quite  plausible  and  Ihave  no  quarrel  with  it.  I do  want  to  say,  though, that  I think ChuckPartee  put  his  finger  right  on it:  The  aggregate  statistics  look  greatbut  an  awful  lot  of  the economy  looks  sour.  I don't  ever  recall  aperiod  in which  there  was  such imbalance  in  the  economy  as  we'rewitnessing  right  now.  We  really have  two  economies  going here;  itdepends  on what  business  you're  in.  None  of  our  directors  buys  andsells  GNP;  they buy  and  sell  other things.  And  if they  are  in  thedefense  business,  or  aerospace,  or  electronics,  or  in  some  capitalgoods  industries,  they  are  doing  great.  But  if they  are  in mining,agriculture,  forest  products,  and  so  forth,  they're  doing  lousy.  Toadd  to  what  Bob  Forrestal  and  somebody  else  mentioned--that  theMidwest  is  not  the  only place  where  agriculture  is  in  trouble--two  ofour  biggest  banks  are  having  problems  right  now  and  are  undersurveillance,  in  large  part  because  of  bum agricultural  loans.  Justso  you  don't  get  the wrong  idea  on that,  it's  not  only bum  real  estateloans.  There are  bum  farm  loans  and  big chunks  of very  bad  realestate  loans;  even  the  agri-business  [unintelligible].  At  big banksin  California agriculture  is  a problem.  I agree  with  Bob  that  it  isnot  a local  problem.It's  time  to  be  optimistic  as  we  look  at  the  aggregatestatistics  and  I feel  optimistic  in  that  sense.  But  only  at  ourperil,  I think,  should we  ignore  some  of these  other  factors,  whichsooner  or  later  are  going  to  come  home  to  roost.  Going back toHenry's  remarks  about  there being  no  relation  between the  age  and  thehealth  of  an  expansion,  I would  simply  add  that  most  expansions  in  myrecollection have  come  about  because  of  a combination  of  inflationarypressures  and  rising  interest  rates.  And those  are  the things  thatright  now  certainly  could  trigger what  looks  to  be  a  soundexpansionary trend  and  [turn  out  to]  be  unsustainable developmentsthat  could  quickly  come  to  an  end.  I feel  good  about  the  generalprospects  for  1985  and  I'm  beginning  to wonder  how much  longer we'lllive  with these  big  problems  hanging  over  us.  One  or  more  of thoseproblems  could  push  us  over the  cliff before  1985  is  over,  but  I don'tthink that  will  happen.  That's more  likely  to  occur in  1986.

[SECTION]

MR. GAINOR.  We've  come  down  on  the  optimistic  side  of  thestaff  forecast:  a little higher  on  GNP  and  a  little  lower  on thedeflator.  But  those who  have  talked  about  the  agricultural  sector  are2/12-13/85-25-certainly  reflecting  our  views.  There  are  serious  debt  problems;collateral  value  is  falling;  and  it  has  become  a fairly  hot  politicalissue  in  our District  and  elsewhere,  as  you  can  imagine.  There  arebills  in  every  one  of  our  [state]  legislatures  to  try  to  provide  somerelief  for the  agricultural  sector.  Most  deal with ways  to  moderatethe  impact  of debt  service  for  the farmers.  And,  of  course,  one  ofthe  objectives  is  to  provide  some  liquidity  for  spring  planting--cashfor  seed--which is  a very  serious  issue.  While  we  don't  think it  ismonetary policy's  role  to  deal with this,  monetary policy is  not  goingto  be  immune  in  that  there  is  a great  deal  of  sensitivity to  interestrates.  And  if  rates  start  to  rise,  I think  perhaps  some  politicalpressure  that  currently  is  not  on  the  Fed  will  gravitate toward us.So  we  are  concerned about  rates  in that  context.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  nobody  else has  anything  to  say,  maybewe  ought  to  have  Mr. Axilrod  say  something  about  these  targets  fornext  year.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  went  over the  question  of whether torebase  last  month.  You're  aware  that  that  is  one  of theAdministration's  helpful  proposals  in  its  economic  report  andelsewhere.  I detected  very  little  or  no--I  don't  remember  [any]--sentiment  for  rebasing  last  time.  You've  had  another month  or  more tothink  about  it.  Maybe we  can  dispose  of that  issue  quickly,  if  youhaven't  changed your  opinion.  And if  you have,  let  me  know.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I think the  Chairman's memory  serves  him well.I don't  believe there was  any  overt  support  for  rebasing.  To  startfrom  some  theoretical  level  being  captured by  a range we  set  some  timeback  has  very  little to  recommend  it,  it  seems  to me.  I would  opposeany  rebasing now, with  all  due  respect  to  Bill  Poole and  his  goodlanguage  in  the  CEA report.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Also,  Mr. Chairman,  with the  revised  numbersthat  we  soon will  be  putting  out,  the  deviation  from the midpoint  isdown  to  three-tenths  of  1 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  no.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  No,  it's  more than  that.

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  It's  eight-tenths--5.2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  No,  this  change  in--

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS(?).  [The  midpoint]  was  5-1/2  percent,  wasn't  it?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  6 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS(?).  The  range was  4 to  8 percent,  that's  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  Aside  from the  numbers,  I think Pres  has  madethe  basic  case  and  I would  agree  with  him 100  percent on  this  issue.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman,  I always  have  had  problems  withtelling  someone we're  aiming  for  a percentage  rate  of  growth  from  some2/12-13/85-26-point  we haven't  reached,  but  I always  have  had  sympathy  for  thesemoving  lines  around  the midpoint  rather  than  the moving  megaphone.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let  me  get  to  that  as--

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Well,  that's  part  of  the--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm  going  to  get  to  that  issue too.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Okay.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  They're  somewhat  related,  but  let  me  see

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I'd  be  opposed  to  rebasing.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  I am, too,  as  you currently  define  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  hear  any  sentiment  for  rebasingwhat--here.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  May  I just  ask  a question?  I haven't  seen whatit  would  do  to  the  numbers  to  have  an  average  of the months  for thepreceding year  used as  the  base.  I think that  was  one  of theproposals  that--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  No,  I thought  they  based  it  on the  fourth-quarter  average.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  I think they  have  it  two ways.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  they  used  the  fourth-quarteraverage.  But  another  question, which  I have  looked  at  myself  at  timesin  the  past,  is  why  we  put  all  this  emphasis  on  the  fourth  quarterinstead  of  on  a yearly  average  target.  That's  another way  to  do  it.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well,  the  growth  for  1984  year-over-year was6.9  percent;  fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter  it  was  5.2  percent,rounded.  I could  get  you the  level,  but  these  things  just  tend tooffset  each  other;  as  you  go  back  over  the years  they tend  to  averageout.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles,  did  you have  some  comment  onthis  point?

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Well,  mine  is  the  same  as  Bob  Black's.  I thinka good  alternative  to  rebasing, which  has  its  problems,  is  theflexibility  [unintelligible]  the  parallel  line  idea  that  we've  seen inthe  Bluebook.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let  me  get  to  that  in  a minute.  Itake  it  there  is  no  sentiment  to  rebase.  In  fact,  I don't  think thatthis  is  an  intellectually  stupid way  to  approach  it.  It's  a perfectlyreasonable  thing  to  do,  but  I don't  think  there's  any more  reason  torebase  than  not  to  rebase.  It  depends  upon  whether,  on  the  basis  ofthe  year's  events,  we're  happier to  start  out  one way  rather than  theother  way,  depending upon  some  kind  of an  analysis.  And  that's  theway  I would  explain  it.  But  the  convention  is  not  to  rebase,  so  the2/12-13/85-27-burden  of proof  is  on  changing  it.  In this  particular year,  if werebased  M1  up  I don't  know what we'd  do  about  M3.  We'd  have  to  rebaseit  way  down  and have  a  peculiar  explanation.  The  same  is  true  forcredit,  I suppose,  if we  took that  seriously.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  I did  have  one  comment,  Mr.  Chairman.  You  saidyou'd  get  around  to the  idea  of the  parallel  lines  rather than thecone.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm  getting  around  to  it  right  now.  If  Iview the consensus  accurately  on  the  cones  [it  is  not  to]  rebase.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  But  my  point  is  that  if we  don't  rebase,  weshould do  something  else  or  I think we'll  have  a big problem with M1appearing to  be  over  its  range  for  a good  part  of--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  on  this  issue  of  how we  draw thepicture  I will  declare my  position:  I have  never  liked  cones.  I wenton  a little  campaign  a couple  of  years  ago  when the  staff had  palsy inthat  they  couldn't write  these things  without making  a cone.  But,  onepart  of the  substance,  anyway--in fairness,  I don't  think  it's  allthat  the Council  [of Economic  Advisers]  had  in  mind--is whether we  aredisturbed that  we  are  above  the  cone  now.  Now, this  gets  into  theshort-run  policy  decision  a little  as  well  as  the  longer-run.  But  Ithink--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Growth  has  been  pretty  fast,  if that's  whatyou're  asking.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I'm not  quite  asking that.  I'masking:  Are you  so  unhappy  that  it's  not  so  slow,  having  started  inwas  important  to  get  it  back in  the  cone  in  January  or  February?  Now,I would  just  assert  "no."  But  that's  certainly  an  interpretation;  Idon't  know what  the  Committee thinks.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I for  one  would agree withyou;  I'm not  worried.  I would  be  worried,  except  for the  expectationof  the  Board's  staff--with which  our  staff agrees--that  the  velocityof M1  will  probably be  down  in  this  current  quarter  and  maybe  for  thefirst half  of the year,  and  that  it  will  be  up  in the  neighborhood  of1 percent  for  the  year  as  a whole.  That's  an  excellent  reason  to  runabove  path  right  now  and maybe  for  a good  part  of the year.  It  isgoing to make  us  look a little  silly  every Friday  in that  chartshowing  the  level  of M1  in  relation to  the cone  for  the  year  that  TheWall  Street  Journal  prints.  The  same  thing  is  in the  San  FranciscoExaminer and  heaven  knows  where  else  around  the  country.  Those whodon't  look at  it  carefully or  don't  remember  all  of your  finetestimony,  say:  "Aha! The  Fed  is  off  the  money  [target]  and  isovershooting again."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Technically, it  is  literally  true  that  theway  The  Wall  Street  Journal  depicts  the  picture, they  can write thatfor  the week of  December 31st  we were  below the  midpoint  of  the moneysupply  target  and  that  for  the week of  January  7th--without  any  changein the  money  supply--we  were  above target.  I don't  think that  makes  alot  of  sense,  but--2/12-13/85-28-

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Paul,  when we  use  the  parallel  line,  I think weought  to  be  clear  what  the  meaning is.  If we  are  well  above where  thecone  would  be  in the  early  part  of  it  but  below the top  parallel  line,I believe  that  means  that  the  growth  rate  from there  on  until  the  endof the  area  covered  by  the  parallel  line has  to  be  less  than themidpoint  of the  cone.  Isn't  that  right?

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  So,  it's  really  just  cosmetic.  It  means  that  wehave  to  get  a lower  growth  rate  if  we're  above  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  is  literally  drawing  pictures,  butpictures  affect  things.  I don't  know how we  want  to  draw this.  Oneway  that  appeals  to  me, but  it's  a  really  special  case  because  I thinkit's  more  substantive--.  If we  just  draw parallel  lines,  we have toask  ourselves  the  question:  Would we  be  particularly  happy--right nowstarting  off in  the upper  part  of  the  parallel  lines--to  go  down  tothe  bottom part,  which  is  way below the  cone?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's  a precipitous  drop.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  would  be  quite  a precipitous  drop.  AndI would  argue--I  think  as  a matter  of  substance,  recognizing that  allpictures  aren't  perfect--that  we  could  just  draw  parallel  lines  andsay  this  is  the  way  it  looks  with  parallel  lines.  We  could  drawparallel  lines  and  a cone.  That's  one  way  of  handling this;  we'vedone  that  once.  We also  drew a  skewed  one  once.  I think  it  has  somemeaning  to  say  that  we  have  the points  in the  fourth  quarter of  thisyear,  which  are  established  by the  basic  target,  whatever  that  is.  Westarted  out  above  the  cone  because  it  was  coming  up,  largely  inwouldn't be  really  happy based upon  anything  we  know now--going belowthat  lower  line  in  the cone.  And we  could  draw  a line  up  from thatpoint  in  the fourth  quarter  back to  the upper  part  of  the  range  in thefourth  quarter  of this  year.  The  result  would be  a truncated  cone;  Ithink  that would  be  the mathematical  expression.  And  it  would be,  Ithink,  a substantive  portrayal  of the  area  in which  we  might  like tobe.  But  it's  just  one  way  of drawing  the  picture.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Would  you describe  that  again?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Just  fill  in the  top  of  those  lines?

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  It  looks  a bit  like  a whale,  I think.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Draw a  line  from the  fourth-quarter targetof this  year  to  the  fourth-quarter target  of next  year.  That's  aline.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Oh,  I see.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  And  then  draw a  cone  off  of the  fourth-quarteraverage?  Would  that  be  the point?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  [Unintelligible]  look  at  it  in these  terms.2/12-13/85-29-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  If  you do  it  that  way, the bottom  linesare the  same  as  the  cone.  Well,  look  at  M2  here.  It  does  not  lookvery  different  from that;  that  top  dotted  line there  would  be  a littlehigher.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  would be  a little higher  at  the beginning.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  At  the  beginning,  yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Isn't  that  essentially  rebasing?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You're  ending  up  in  the  fourth  quarterjust  where  you would  end  up  anyway.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  You would  start  the top  parallel  line  where  the8 percent  is?  Is  that  how you would  do  it?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  not  at  the  end  of the  year.  I wouldstart  it  in  November.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  All  right,  at  the  end  of  November.  And  you'regoing to  call  this  a truncated  cone?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I'm not  going to  call  it  anything.  Iwould  describe  it  to  the  [Congressional]  Committee  as  a reasonablepicture  of the  general  zone  in which we'd  like to  be  as  the  yearprogresses.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman,  are  you  aware  that there's  a brandof  golf balls  that has  truncated-cone dimples?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Actually,  I think  I drew a picture  likethis  once  without  consulting  this  Committee.  I was  probably using  itin testimony.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  So,  this  is  sort  of half  rebasing  and  half not.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I don't  think it's--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  No,  it's  not  really  rebasing.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  It's  not  rebasing.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  makes  a lot  of  sense,  actually.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think  it  recognizes that  we  wouldn'tdraw  it  that way unless  we  wanted to  convey  a notion that  we wererelaxed  about  being  above  this  cone  for  a few months,  or  for  the  firsthalf  of the  year  or  something.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Under  other  circumstances  one might  draw thegeometry the  other way.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  other  way.  I think  it  depends  uponthe  substantive  decision  as  to  what  kind  of  policy  we want  to--2/12-13/85-30-

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  It  conveys  it  a lot  better than a geometricallyneutral  form, if you would.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Are you  talking  about  that  for  all  the Ms  oronly  for  M1?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  For M2  we  might  just  draw the  parallellines,  I suppose.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  They're  definitely pretty  close.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It's  so  close  it  makes  practically  nodifference.  For M3,  I don't  know what  you want  to  do.  We  can  drawparallel  lines,  I guess,  and  a cone.  Mr.  Sternlight,  I have  a noteindicating  that  you wanted  to  talk.

[SECTION]

MR. STERNLIGHT.  No  sir.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think we  have  to  decide  just  atthe moment,  but  we  have  to  talk  about  it  and  decide  when we  come tothe  decision on  what  the targets  should be  precisely  and  what  to  sayin  the  directive.  We  can  just  do  it.  One way  of  finessing this,which we  did  once,  is  to  draw the  parallel  lines  and  the  cone--whichis  what  the  staff has  there.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Have  both.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.  Well,  we  could  just  draw theparallel  lines.

[SECTION]

If  we draw thisstrange  looking picture,  you're  going  to  spend  about  6 pages  of  yourtestimony trying  to  explain to  Congress  what  that  crazy  thing is.

MR. MARTIN.  The  Volckergram!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  There's  also  the  question  of what  weightto  put  on M1.  But  it's  getting  late.  I don't  know whether  there  issome  spontaneous  consensus  on  the  range  itself.  We  can  decide  ittomorrow morning unless  a spontaneous  consensus  emerges.  If  I recall[our  discussion at  the December meeting]  correctly--though  nobody  isbound,  obviously,  by what  he  or  she  said  last  time--in  a vague  way  thepredominant  support  was  for  alternative  II  but  there  was  some  supportfor  something that would  look  at  least  partly  like  alternative  I.  Idon't  think  anybody  was  arguing for  alternative  III,  although  somebodydon't  remember that  closely.  Nobody  is  bound  by  that  anyway.  We'llnarrow it  down  anyway.  Is  something less  than  alternative  II  in theballpark?

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  I join  President  Balles  in the  caveat  that,  tothe  extent  that  alternative  II  is  beginning  to  emerge  as  a  consensus,I think we may  have  pragmatic  difficulties  with the  upper bound  of  M1.Given the  staff  forecast  of  income  and  interest  rates,  their warningthat  the  projections  on velocity have  some  confidence  limits  aroundthem, and  given the  lagged  effect  of the  interest  rate  drop  that  we'vehad,  V1  could  even be  a little  negative  next  year.  If we're  going  foralternative  II--as  I hear  you,  John--it  seems  that  we  ought  to  dosomething  about  the  upper  boundary  for M1;  7 percent  may  be too  low.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I wouldn't--

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  I don't  see  the  setting  of these targetsas  a means  of accommodating  the economy.  We're  setting  the  targets  soas  to  shape  the  economy.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  I'd  like  to  see  us  shape the  economy  with  a 4percent  real  growth  rate,  Henry.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Well,  that's  not  my objective.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  If you  look  at  where  our  projections were  lastmedian  forecast  for  real  GNP  looks  like  it  might  be  half a percent  orso  higher  than it  was  then.  For  the  GNP  deflator  it  looks  like  themedian  forecast  is  going to  be  about  1-1/4  to  1-1/2  percent  lower.So,  we  have  more real  money  balances  assumed  and  a  larger  real  GNPgrowth  and  it  seems to  me  that we  would  have  a heck of  a timeexplaining to  anybody why  we  raised  the  targets  for money  growth.  Ithink we  could  sit  with  these.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  Lyle,  we're not  raising  the targets;  we'relowering  them by 1/2  a point  for M1.  I would  suggest  7-1/2  percent  togo  along with  the  8-1/2  percent  on M2.  That  would  be  taking the upperlimit  1/2  point  [above  the  tentative  target]  and  a  1/2  point  [below2/12-13/85-32-the  target]  the year  before.  It  gives  us  a little  room.  We'retalking  about  being  around  the upper  limit  of  each  of those  ranges.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  It's  room  I don't  think we  need.  And  I thinkwe  send  the wrong  kind  of  signal  when,  after  having  set  these  targetsinitially, we're  forecasting  more  real  growth  and  higher  growth  ofmoney balances  with the  lower  GNP  deflator.  I don't  see that  we  needthat  additional  freedom.  And  I would  prefer  to  send  a  signal  whichsays:  "Look, we're  still  concerned with bringing  down  growth  of moneyand  credit  over  the  long  run  to  bring down  inflation."

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I think there's  a  good  argument  for  not  changinganything  in  that we  don't  have  the  faintest  idea  what  the  velocitiesare  going  to be  anyway.  Therefore, why  not--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  But  we're  going  to  shape  the  economyanyway.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  And  I don't  see  any  point  in  changing  the  debtrange  because,  historically,  an  8 to  11  percent  range  for  debt  gives  alot  of  room for  8 percent  nominal  GNP  growth.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  It  just  hasn't  in the  last  few years.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  this may  be  a little  side  issue.  Itdidn't  last  year  and  maybe the  year before;  I don't  remember.  But  Iwas  a little  struck too when  somebody--Mr.  Axilrod,  I guess--saidthat,  obviously, we  can't  lower  that  unless  we're  going to  saysomething about  all  these  mergers  and  so  forth.  Why  is  the  analysisso  certain that  what  we  have  for  nominal  GNP  growth--7  or  8 percent  orwhatever--is  going  to  produce  11  or  12  percent  debt  growth when  that'sout  of  keeping with  90  percent  of history?  It  is  not  last  year'shistory,  I agree;  but  what  is  the  analytic  background?  Is  it  thedeficit?  Is  it  a high  deficit  that  produces  that?  I don't  know.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  No,  because  if  it  were  8 percentnominal  GNP  growth,  particularly in  a more mature  stage  of  thebusiness  recovery,  normally the  deficit  financing this  percentage  ofGNP  would be  down.  I think that's  why the  predicament  of this  overallcredit  market  situation  is  so  hard  to--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What  you're  saying may  be true;  I'm notsure what  it  is--that  the  dollar  of  government  deficit  produces  moredebt  than  the  dollar  of  private  deficit?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  No,  I'm saying--

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  If  there  is  a difference from the  historical[experience],  it's  the  fact  that  our  total  expenditures  are  runningsubstantially  above the  GNP.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  one  reason.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Therefore,  you  could  argue  that  you  need  moredebt.  But  don't  you  also  need more  money?  Why  do  you need  more debtand  not  more money  to  finance  a greater  level  of  expenditures?  It'snot  immediately  apparent  to  me.2/12-13/85-33-

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  Velocity is  down.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we're  throwing out  two  questions  tothe  staff now.  We'll  get  a response  and  go  home.  Maybe  it's--

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Well,  maybe  part  of  it--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  The  staff was  tempted  to  suggest  throwing awaythe  debt  variable  as  not  being useful.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  I second that.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  President  Morris  mentioned  one thing.  In  someresearch we've  done,  the debt  does  seem  to  run  a little  betterrelative to  total  spending than it  does  to  GNP.  So  that  gives  you  apercentage  point.  Last  year  we  thought  the mergers  and  acquisitionsadded  about  a point.  I threw  in  a quarter  of a  point  for  theacceleration  of  state  and  local  government borrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  2-1/4  points.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  I think you  can  throw in  another  tenth or  twofor  those HUD notes  that  came  at  the  end  of  the  year.  I didn't  throwthat  in  there.  I personally believe  that the  government  deficit  doesget  you  greater  credit  growth  relative  to  GNP,  though  it's  a littlehard  to  find  it  in  the  data.  Of  course,  we  haven't  had  so  many yearswith  these  big deficits.  You  can  base  it  partly  on the  grounds  thatthe  government does  [not]  really have  the  option  to  finance  itself  by(a) issuing  equity  or  (b) drawing down  assets.  Now, the private[sector]  can't  draw down  assets  forever,  but  they  have  that  [option]as  well.  So,  we  really have  reduced  the  credit  growth by  roughly  thesame  amount  as  we  reduced  nominal  GNP.  When we  worked  through thewhole  flow of  funds,  we  had  a hard time  getting  any  less  credit  growththan  that,  going through  it  sector-by-sector  and  taking  all  thesethings  I've  mentioned  into  account.  I think we  have  about  1/2  pointor  so  in  there  for mergers  and  acquisitions.  That  would  be myresponse.  I don't  know whether Mike  or  Jim  has  anything to  add  tothat.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We  had  some  discomfort  about  the overall  debtgrowth  relative  to  GNP.  But  we  also  know, as  President  Corriganpointed  out,  that  we  have  had  this  very  strong trend  over the  past  twoyears.  In  arithmetic  terms  it  seems  to  have  been related  to  thisunusual  Federal  borrowing,  and  that  will  continue.  We  just  couldn'treally  find  the  basis--in  terms  of  a set  of  credit  flows  consistentwith  our  sectoral  picture  and the  GNP  forecast--for  squeezing out  muchmore  debt  in  the household  sector  and  the business  sector.  I mustunderscore  that  the  assumption we made  about  mergers  and  acquisitionsand  so  on  is  rather  arbitrary.  We  don't  see  the  pattern clearly yet,and  it's  not  inconceivable  that we  could  get  a  larger amount.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Just  to  clarify  it  in my mind:  What  wouldyour  straightforward  projection  of debt  be  consistent  with your  wholemodel  and whatever  mergers  and  acquisitions  you  allowed  for?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  11.7  percent.2/12-13/85-34-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  11.7  percent, which  includes  1/2  point  formergers  and  acquisitions.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Roughly.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  There's  no  model;  this  is  purely  judgmental.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  And that's  2 percentage  points  less  than ayear  ago.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  But  with  a lower  GNP.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  It  was  13.6  percent  in  1984.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And  2 points  less  in the  GNP  growth.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  It's  a comparable  excess  over  GNP  growth.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Let  me make  one  comment  on the  Federal  side.I was  looking at  the numbers  back  in  the  1975  through  1978  period;  in1978  Federal  debt  was  growing  at  under  10  percent--more  like  9percent.  This  time, in  1985,  we  are  still  facing  15  percent  rates  ofincrease.  We  have come  down  from  19  percent  to  17-1/2  percent  to  15percent.  Those  are very  large  numbers  to  deal  with  and  see  the total

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Yes.  And  even  in  1975,  on thatchart  we had  earlier,  the big  spike  in  government  borrowing wasaccompanied by  a corresponding downward  spike  in  private  borrowing.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  what  you'd  think might  happennormally.  Well,  let's  stop  for the  evening  unless  somebody  hassomething  further they  want  to  say.

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  Have  you  heard  anything about  transportation tothe  Embassy  tonight?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  were  in the midst  of  discussing theselong-range targets,  but maybe  we  can  interrupt  that  for  Mr.  Kichline'sreport  on the  only new  economic news  we  got  overnight.  Why  don't  youinsert that  at  this  stage?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  We  have  the  advance  retail  sales  number  forwere  downward  revisions  for  both  November and  December.  The  group,the  so-called  retail  control--excluding  autos  and  gasoline  stationsand  nonconsumer  sorts  of things--was  down  0.4  percent  in  January.More  importantly, December  was  revised  down  to minus  0.2  percent;  ithad  been  plus  0.6  percent.  And  there  was  also  a downward revision  inaround  0.5  percent  in  the  first  quarter.  That  would  have  put  thethe  fourth-quarter  average.  Taking  these numbers  as  they now stand,these numbers  are  appreciably weaker.  Who  knows  what  they will  be  3or  4 months  from now when  they're  revised?  But  this  is  certainly  nota bullish  report.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Was  the  November  revision  significant too,  Jim?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Yes.  For  total  sales  they had been  showing  a2.0  percent  increase;  it's  now  1.5  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I see.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  For  this  retail  control,  it  was  up  1.6  percentand  it's  now up  1.3  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  So,  it  really has  drifted  quite  a lot  lower.

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Correct.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We were  discussing what  the  long-rangetargets  should be.  I think  the conclusion  has  been  reached  not  torebase,  though  some  imagination in  drawing  lines may  be  desirable.  Wewere  on  the  subject  of what  the targets  should be.  There  was  someexpression that  they ought  to  be  the  way they are  in  alternative  IIand  some  expression  that  at  least  M1  ought  to  be  a  1/2  percentagepoint  higher  on  the upper  end.  There  was  one  expression  of that  view.Does  anybody  else  have  anything to  say?  Mr.  Rice.

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  Mr.  Chairman, given  the  forecasts  that  we've made--noting  that  nobody  expects  real  growth less  than  3 percent  or  inexcess  of  4-1/2  percent--I  think  alternative  II  looks  very  good.  Itseems  to me  that  the  ranges  proposed  for  M1  and  M2 would  accommodategrowth  within the  range  of  3 to  4-1/2  percent.  I'm  quite  comfortablewith  a range  for  M1  of  4 to  7 percent  and  for M2  of  6 to  8-1/2percent.  I could  live  with the  proposed  ranges  for  M3  and  totalcredit,  but  I would  prefer  to  see  M3  raised  1/2  of  a percentage pointto  6-1/2 to  9-1/2  percent  and  credit  at  9 to  12  percent.  We  expect M1to  come  in  near  the upper  reaches  of the  range.  And while  we  hopethat  M3  will  also  be  in the upper  part  of the  range  established, wehave  this  experience  of M3  running very high.  And  I don't  see why  we2/12-13/85-36-should  not  set  the  ranges  so  that  M3  will  be  at  least  closer,  if notwithin, the  range.  The  main  objection to  that  seems  to  be  that  thiswould  transmit  a signal to  the  public  that we  are not  beingsufficiently vigilant  or,  in  the  case  of total  credit,  that we'retrying to  accommodate  the  deficit.  I myself  am not  impressed  withthat  argument.  It  seems  to me that  the  public  cares  most  of  all  aboutM1  and,  to  some  extent,  M2.  But  I don't  believe  the  public would  bealarmed if we  recognize that  M3  is  tending to  run very  high relativeto  its  range  as  it  has  in  recent  months  and  that  we  allowed  for thatby  increasing the  band  to  6-1/2  to  9-1/2  percent.  I would  favor  alsoa range  for  total  credit  of  9 to  12  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Refresh my memory, Mr.  Axilrod.  Do  yourtechnical  gnomes  think that M3  is  [more]  likely  to  run  high  relativeto  its  range  than  M2?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  I think the  difference  in  our  point  estimatesis  trivial.  Our  point  estimate  for  M2  is  around  8 percent  and  ourpoint  estimate  for M3  is  close to  8-3/4  percent.  I would  say  that  thebest  way to  think  of  it  is  that M3  looks  a shade  closer  to  the  upperend  than M2,  but  I would  have  some  doubts  that  M2 will  run  quite  thatlow--

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  But,  Steve, doesn't  that  depend  in  part  on  theassumption  of higher  interest  rates  as  the  year  goes  on?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  That's  right.  We  have  a slight  drift  up  ininterest  rates,  which was--

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  But  your  assumption that  M3  will  stay within therange  is  based  on your  expectations  that  interest  rates  will--

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  I would  say  that's  equally  important  toM2.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  It  may  not  happen.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Corrigan.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Well,  I would  prefer  the  rangesactually  adopted  in mid-1984,  although  I'm a little  agnostic  on  someshading of  those targets  insofar  as  they  pertain to  M3  and  totalcredit.  But,  in  particular,  I would  not  want  to  see  the M1  range  for1985  different  from the  4 to  7 percent.  If  M1  were  at  the  top  of thatrange,  at  7 percent,  that  would permit  an  8 percent  rise  in nominalGNP  with only  a 1 percent  increase  in  velocity.  And  that's notunusual,  even  for  the  third  year  of  economic  expansion.  On  the  otherhand,  if  inflation  could  actually  be  lower than  4 percent  or  so--assome  people  suggest--then  that  kind  of  a result  could  occur with  evenless  than  a 1 percent  increase  in velocity.  More  importantly,  if  itworked  out  during the year  that  velocity wasn't  growing  at  all  but  wasthat  direction--even if  it  meant  being  above  the  range,  which  I thinkis  unlikely--than to  have  to  adjust  the other  way.  [By  other way,  Imean]  having money  growth  at  7-1/2  or  8 percent,  which would still  bein  the  target  range  but  in  a context  in which it  turns  out  thatvelocity  is  increasing and  nominal  GNP  is  growing too  fast.  So,  Ifeel  somewhat  strongly  about  that  one  in  particular.  In  general,  I2/12-13/85-37-prefer  something like  alternative  II  or  the  ranges  we  adoptedtentatively  in  July--again with  some  agnosticism  on  credit  and  M3.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Martin.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I would  echo  Governor  Rice'scomments  with regard  to the  understandable  shift  in  our  views  towardthe  probability  of  a bit  stronger  growth.  It  seems  to  me  that  in  ourdiscussion  yesterday,  something like  half of us  were  talking  aboutgrowth of  4 percent,  or  at  least  higher  growth than the  staffforecast.  It's  obvious  also  in  the tabulation done  for  the  July[Humphrey-Hawkins]  Report  to  the  Congress  vis-a-vis  our most  recenttabulation that  there has  been  a shift  of  1/2  or  1/4  percentage  point,or  something  of  that magnitude.  That  says  to me  that  there  is  astronger possibility than  existed  before  that  M1  growth  for  1985  willnot  only  run  above  the  6-1/2  percent  but  that  it  could  easily  run  7 or7-1/2  percent.  We  still  don't  know what  the  lagged  effect  will  be  ofthe  drop  in  short-term rates  which, after  all,  was  a very substantialdrop.  It  hasn't  worked  its way  through  and we  don't  know what  thatwill  do  to  velocity.  And we  can't  escape the  din of  news with  regardto  the  strength  of the  dollar  and  the  [unintelligible]  that's  in  thatnews  from time-to-time  of  almost  a scramble  for  dollars  in  this  orthat  market.  It  seems  to  me  that  we  easily  could  have  a 7-1/2  percentrate  of  growth in  M1,  which would  be  consonant  with  a favorableinflation  outlook and  export  performance.  Regardless  of the  geometrythat  we're  presenting  on  this  and  that  The  Wall  Street  Journal  ispicking up,  the  implication  at  least  is  that  M1  will  be  running abovethe  7-1/2  percent  level  and that  there will  be implicit  or  explicitpressure  on  us  to  adjust.I favor  [an  upper  limit  of]  7-1/2  percent with  some  commentswith  regard  to  some  of these matters  that  have  developed  since  July.Goodness  knows,  there  have  been  enough  developments  of  substance  sincewe  reported to  the  Congress  in July  to  risk breaking  a precedent!  Myunderstanding  is  that  we  don't  change  these  outer  boundaries  of  rangesof monetary aggregates  once they  are  set;  I don't  see  why we  should beconfined to  that  kind  of  a pattern.  I suggest  that  we  use  7-1/2percent  [as  the  upper  limit]  for  M1.  I think  some  of the  samecomments  could  extend  to  M2.  It  may  run  at  or  above  the  upper  limitthat  we  set  in  July.  The  8-1/2  percent doesn't  seem to  be  asimportant  in  the way  the market  looks  at  the monetary aggregates.  Wehave to  think of  how they--the  traders,  the  market makers--think.  Iwould  extend that  even more  so  to  M3  and  to  total  credit.  I'm notready to  jettison  total  credit  as  was  suggested  yesterday.  Obviously,we  don't  seem to  be  gigged  in  the  market  and  in  the  market  commentswhen  we  exceed  the  latter  two  broader measures.  So,  I would  opt  foran  upper  limit  of  7-1/2  percent  for M1  and  leave  the  other  threeranges  where  they  are.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know what  historians  we have  here.How much have  we  changed these  ranges?  Do  we  never  change  them?  We[unintelligible]--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Partee.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I think  there's  a lot  to  be  said  for  the  4 to  8percent  range  on M1.  My particular  point  estimate  is  8 percent  onnominal  GNP,  and  if we  have  the  1 percent  increase  in velocity  thatthe  staff is  predicting,  that will  result  in  a 7 percent  [Ml]  growthrate,  which  would  be  consistent  with that.  That's  at  the  very upperend  of  our  4 to  7 percent  range  and  a 4 to  8 percent  range  gives  us  alittle  room.  And  it  seems  to  me  that  it's  more  likely  to  fit  suitablyin  a year  which--if it  comes  out  as  we are  projecting it--producessuitable  results  of 4  percent  or  thereabouts  on  real  growth  and  4percent  or  maybe  a little  less  than that  on  inflation.  I don't  seewhy  in  advance  we  should show  some  inclination  to try  to  screw down  onthe  economy  with this  kind  of  a prospect.  I also  think  it  would  lookgood  from the  standpoint  of the  public  because we're  saying:  "Look,inflation  has  developed  quite  a bit  better than we  expected."Although it's  not  zero,  as  Henry  keeps  pointing  out,  it  looks  likeit's  going to  be  a quiet  period  and  we  don't  want  to  stop  the  economyfrom  having  reasonable  growth.  Therefore,  since  the  problems  haven'tmaterialized that  we were beginning  to  anticipate when we  cut  thatrange back  in July,  I think there's  a lot  to  be  said  for putting itback  where  it  was  before,  at  4 to  8 percent.  It  could  be  played  verywell.  Therefore,  I think  that's  what  we  ought  to  do.I don't  think we  ought to  get  into  some  kind  of  a box  onthese  other Ms  because we're  trying  to  be  tight  about  everything.  So,taking  4 to  8 percent  for  an M1  range,  I also  would  take  the  rest  ofalternative  I for  M2  and M3.  Maybe  total  credit  ought  to  be  9 to  12percent  rather  than 9-1/2  to  12-1/2  percent,  but  I see  nothing wrongwith  that  in the  context  we're  talking about.  Now,  if  our  forecastturns  out  to be  seriously  in  error,  that  upper  limit  will  give  us  aconstraint.  If more inflation  begins  to  develop,  we'll  start  to  popover  the  upper  limit  and  that  will  be  the basis  for  snugging up  in  thegoes  up  2 percent  or  3  percent  rather than  1 percent,  there's  noreason  we  can't  fall  below  the  7 percent  normative  number  that  I havenow  in  my forecast  and  take  6 or  5-1/2  percent.  That's  within therange we're  talking about.  So,  I think the  4 to  8 percent  range  fitsvery  nicely  with the  economic  circumstances  that  we're  talking  aboutfor  this  particular  year,  and  I would  support  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Velocity went  up  4 percent  last  year.  Mr.Black.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman,  I come  out  in  a different  placethan most  of the  others.  I think we've  done  remarkably well withmonetary  policy  the  last  year  and  a half,  so  far  as  M1  is  concerned  inparticular.  We've  about  hit  our  targets  right  on the button;  we  werea little  off  last  year,  but  not  a great  deal.  Accordingly,  I thinkit's  important  that  we  continue this  progress  that  we've made  and  Iwould  go  with alternative  II.  I accept  the  staff's  suggestion that  weincrease  the monitoring range  [for  total  credit].  But  I wouldstrongly  prefer  that we  omit  any  reference to  coming  in  at  the toppart  of that  [M1]  range.  If  we hit  the  5-1/2  percent  midpoint,  that'sa little  pickup  from what  we  had  this  past  year:  and with  the  economystill  apparently strong,  I just  don't  think  any  useful  purpose  would2/12-13/85-39-be  accomplished  by  suggesting  that  we were  aiming  for  the top  portionof the  range.  I think  it  might  undermine  some  of the  progress  we  havemade  in  increasing  our  credibility  in  the last  year  and  a half.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr. Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I too  would  prefer  to  see  M1remain in  the  4 to  7 percent  range  for  the  reasons  that  have  alreadybeen  expressed.  And  I would  add  just  two.  First,  I think  thatinflation  expectations  are  better  than they  have  been in the  lastcouple  of months  and,  therefore, we'll  have more  rapid  growth  in  realbalances  that will  give  us  a  little more  leeway  at  the  top  end  of therange.  Also, to  raise the  M1  range  to  4 to  8 percent  at  this  timewould  express  more  concern  about  the  economy  than  our  projectionswould  seem  to  indicate.  I just  have  a feeling that  moving  it  to  4 to8 percent  at  this  point  could  very well  send  the  wrong  signal  to  thewith  the  expectation that  we  probably  would  come  in at  the  top  of therange  in  any  event.  I think  M2  also  should  follow  the  specificationsof alternative  II.  With  respect  to M3,  I have  a  slight  preference  formoving the  range  up  to  reflect  the  reality  of the  situation  that we'vehad  over  the  past  several  months,  and  I would  suggest  a  range  of  6 to10  percent  or  perhaps  5-1/2  to  9-1/2  percent  for  M3.  I think  totalcredit  perhaps  should be  widened  also,  say,  to  8 to  12  percent,although the  8 percent  is  probably not  a very  significant number.  ButI think we  need  to move the  top  end,  again to  reflect what  actuallyhas  been  going  on.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Anybody  else  have  any  comments?

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I also  support  alternative  II  andthe  4 to  7 percent  range  for  M1.  There may  be  reasons--Chuck and  Preshave  talked  about  some  of them--why  M1  indeed  probably would  come  intoward  the top  part  of  the  range.  Nonetheless,  with the uncertaintiesthat  we  face--[the  age  of]  the  recovery,  velocity, exchange  rates,  andso  forth--I'd  like  to  see  discussion in  the  presentation  of theseranges  that  is  a little  more  symmetrical.  While  it  certainly wouldrefer  to  the top  half of the  range,  I'd  favor  some  discussion  aboutthe  uncertainties  and  what  kinds  of things might  have  us  choose  tocome  in  at  the midpoint  or  even  lower  as  the  year  progresses.  Theother  reason that  I favor  the  4 to  7 percent  range  is  that  I think thestatements  about  our  long-term disinflationary  goal  sometimes  getburied  as  we talk  about  some  of  the more  immediate  kinds  of  problemswe  have.  And  I think  it  would  be  a good  place and  a good  way  torestate  the long-term  goal  that we  have.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  As  far  as  M1  is  concerned,  I'd  be  inclined tosplit the  difference between  alternative  I and  alternative  II.  Ithink we  do  have  a  reasonably  favorable outlook  for  1985  in terms  ofreal  growth  and  inflation.  And  I think  we  ought  to  take  favorablethings  as  they  come  along  and  not  clamp  down.  Alternative  II  is  justtoo  snug a  fit  as  far  as  accommodating  what  seems  to  me  a pretty  goodoutlook;  we  need  a little  breathing  room  at  the  top.  Also,  I wouldremind the  Committee that  7-1/2  percent  is  not  an  increase;  it's  ato  the  long-run  goal  of  ratcheting these numbers  down.  But  our  goal2/12-13/85-40-was  4 to  8 percent  last  year;  it  was  not  something  less  than that.So,  it  seems  to  me  that  splitting the  difference  gives  us  theadvantage  of  paying  some  allegiance  to  our  longer-run  goal  ofratcheting  these numbers  down while  at  the  same  time  providing  somebreathing  room to  accommodate what  I think  is  a fairly  favorableoutlook.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  As  it  turns  out,  Mr.  Chairman,  it's  more  usualto  change  the tentative  ranges  than  to  adopt  them.  Of  the  fourrelevant years--1981  through  1984--only  in  1982  were  the tentativeranges  agreed  on  [in  July]  adopted  [the  following  February].  In  1981,1983,  and  1984  they were changed  in varying ways.  In  1983  there  was  asubstantial  change  in  M1:  that's when  it  was  reduced  to  a monitoringrange  and  was  raised  to  4 to  8 percent  as  compared to  the  2-1/2  to  5-1/2  percent  tentative  range.  In  other  [years]  the  changes  were  in M2or  other broad  aggregates.

MR.  KEEHN.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I would  be  with those  whoIt  seems  to  me  that  the  reasons  are  veryendorse  alternative  II. compelling  to  utilize  that  alternative,  and  I'm  not  sure  I'm impressedby  any  compelling  reasons  to  make  a change  at  this  point.  Theeconomic  outlook  as  we  discussed  it  around  the table  seems  prettysolid.  The  inflation  outlook  is  not  unreasonable,  although  itcertainly  continues to  be  an  area  that we  need  to  focus  on.  And thevelocity  patterns  seem to  be more  predictable  than has  been  the  case.So,  I would be  in  favor  of  alternative  II. that  raising the M3  and  credit  aggregate  ranges  would  be  appropriate.And  I think we  should begin  to  place  much  greater  emphasis  on M1  andthat  that  should be  clear  in  the  message  that you  will  be  giving.  Iwould  think that  the  longer-run  objective  for  the year  ought  to  betoward  the  middle  part  and  I would  prefer  that  we  not  necessarilyspecify  that  we  would be  in the upper  or  lower  part  of the  range.  Iwould  be bilateral  on  that,  depending  on  how the  velocity  outlookdevelops  during  the year.  Our  objective  should  be  toward  the middle;by  so  doing,  we  continue  to  give  emphasis  and  credibility  to  theobjective  of  returning to  reasonable  price  stability.I certainly  would  think

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Wallich.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  I continue  to  think  we  ought  to  have  ourmonetary targets  and  try to make  the  economy,  and  mostly  inflation,conform to  them.  I think  we  are  in  some  danger  of  adapting thetargets  to  what  we  think  is  ahead  in  the  economy.  The  only  reason  fordoing the  latter,  it  seems  to  me,  is  a concern  about  high  interestrate  problems  for  farmers,  developing  countries,  or  the  dollar.  Thoseare  important.  But  somehow it  seems  to  me  that  if we  now raise  our2/12-13/85-41-targets,  we're  in  effect  saying that  we're  going  to  maximize  as  bestwe  can  the  expansion of  the  economy  and  maintain  interest  rates  as  lowas  is  consistent  with continued  rapid  growth  rather than focus  on  theobjective of  inflation.  I think  inflation is  the  least  achieved  ofall  of  our  objectives  even  though  it  has  been  better  than  we  expected.But  the  same  is  true  of  unemployment  and  growth;  we  have  done  betteron  each  front  than we  expected.  But  in  absolute  terms we  are  fartherfrom  a good  condition  on  inflation than  we  are,  say,  on  unemploymentand the  use  of  the  economy's  potential.  So,  I would  stay withalternative  II,  and  where  there  seems  to  be  a misfit  such as  on M3  andtotal  credit,  I would  nevertheless  stay with  these  ranges.  I thinkthey  are  telling  us  something;  they  are  not  just  something  that needsto  be  made  to  fit  what  the  economy  does.  If  they  don't  fit,  they'retelling  us  that  credit  is  expanding at  a  rapid  rate  which  at  some  timein  the  future will  cause  us  trouble.  And we  should  recognize  that.Neither,  therefore,  would  I aim at  the  upper  [end  of  the]  range.  Iwould  say that  7 percent  plus  1 or  2 percent  velocity  gives  us  plentyof  room.  I would,  therefore,  accept  alternative  II  exactly  as  it  is.Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I also  would  choose alternative  II  for  a coupleof  reasons.  One,  if we  raise  the  range  even  to  7-1/2  percent--which  Irecognize  is  a move  down  from the  4 to  8 percent--or  if we  move to  an8 percent  limit  on  the  high  side,  as  has  been  suggested,  I believewe're  really  saying  that we've  done  our  job  on  inflation  and  we'rewilling  to  accept  inflation  at  roughly  a 4 percent  level  or  perhaps  alittle  above.  And  that's  a view that  I would not  want  the  Committeeto  give  to  the  public;  I would  not want  to  permit  that  kind  ofinterpretation.  Secondly,  as  to  the  ranges  themselves,  it  seemsfairly  clear  from the  discussion yesterday and  from  the  projectionsthat  4 to  7 percent  will  accommodate the  growth  in  nominal  GNP  thatwe're  looking  for  with the  level  of inflation  we're  expecting.  And  ifit  doesn't,  as  we  have  done  in  the  past,  we  can  talk about  the  upperpart  of the  range.  I would  emphasize  looking for  growth near  themidpoint, but  I'd  be willing to  go  to  the  upper part  of  the  rangeproviding velocity  doesn't  perform  as  we  are  projecting.  As  a result,it  seems  to  me  that  these  ranges  accommodate what  we're  looking  for.I would  like  to  have  the top  at  7 percent,  therefore  providing  somerestraint  in the  event  that  the projections  don't  come  through.Lastly,  I'm not  very  concerned  about  M3  or  credit;  so  the  ranges,whatever they may  be,  are  perfectly all  right  with me.  For  M1  and  M2I would  prefer those  in  alternative  II.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  as  we  all  know,  these  rangesserve many masters.  One  of the masters  is  the  general  impression  ofthe  public  as  to  our  long-run  game  plan--which  has  been  expressed  sowell  by  you over  the  years--to  reduce  gradually  over  time the  rate  ofmonetary  growth  and  get  it  down  to  noninflationary  levels.  For thatreason  I think  it  is  important,  if only  symbolic,  to  lower  the  upperend  of that  range  a touch.  Going  down to  4 to  7 percent,  however,brings  up  the  problems  that  I talked  about  yesterday  and  thatGovernors Martin  and  Partee  ran  off very well  today,  so  I won't  repeatwhat  those  problems  are.  As  I mentioned  yesterday, our  staff forecastshows  money  running  considerably  over  the upper  end  of  the  4 to  72/12-13/85-42-percent  range  for  a good  part  of  the first  half  of this  year based  onthe  present  level  of interest  rates.  To  keep  that  from happening,  ourstaff thinks  we  would have  to  get  a very  considerable  increase ininterest  rates.  That  is  on the assumption that  the  velocity  of moneyis  going to  be  declining during  the  first  half of the  year.  Puttingall  that together,  I would  come  out  in favor  of  a 4 to  7-1/2  percentrange.  Although  a case  could  certainly  be made  for  4 to  8  percent,  Iwould  prefer  the  4 to  7-1/2  percent  simply because  of the  publicperception  that  we  are  gradually making  some  progress  in  reducing  theupper  end  of  that  M1  range.  And  it  is my  understanding that  thefinancial  community  certainly pays  a lot  more  attention to  M1  thanthey  do  any  of the  other  Ms.  I share  President Guffey's  views  on  M3and  total  credit:  it  probably  doesn't  make much  difference.  But  Iwould  adopt  the M2,  M3,  and total  credit  ranges  of  alternative  I,simply to  get  back to  reality  a little.  That  would  be  the totalpicture  I would  recommend,  Mr.  Chairman.

MR.  GARBARINI.  Mr.  Chairman,  the heart  of  the Midwestcontinues  to  dance to  a rhythm that  I believe  the  Chairman has  playedover  the years,  which  leads  us  down  a road  called  "reduced  inflation."We would  support  alternative  II  and  hope  that  we would  not  signal thatwe will  be  in  the  higher  end  of  the  range.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Miss  Seger.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  I support  alternative  I.  I'll  just  say  "ditto"to  Governor Partee's  comments  plus  add  another  observation about  M1.And  that  is:  In  1984,  using the  revised  numbers, M1  growth  was  5.2percent,  which  was  0.8  below the  midpoint  of  last  year's  goal,  if  Idid  the  arithmetic  correctly.  I know we  decided  not  rebase.  Still,if the targets  for  last  year  were  appropriate  and  if that's  the  wayM1's  actual  performance  came  in,  then  I don't  think we  should  ignorethat  when we  set  the targets  for this  year.  Therefore,  I would  liketo  add  that  to  all  the  other  reasons  for  having  the  M1  range  at  4  to  8percent.  Also,  as  I listen to  comments--and  I also  went  back and  re-read  materials  for the  last  two  years--I'm not  convinced  that  wereally have  identified  in  any  exact  way the  relationship  between moneygrowth  and  the  economy.  I don't  think we  always  know what's  going tohappen  to  velocity;  we  may  think we  do,  or  would  like  to,  but  I don'tthink  it  works  out  that  way.  So,  maybe  it's  more honest  to  send  asignal that  we  don't  have  these  precise measures  and,  therefore, wewill  go  with  broader bands.

I really have  no  additionaljustification  for that  other  than  I think it  allows  for  adequate moneygrowth.  I do  think that  the perception  is  always  important  and it  iscertainly important  right  now.  I think that  would  convey  theperception  that  I'd  like  to  see  us  convey.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Governor  Gramley.2/12-13/85-43-

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  I tend  to  think  of these  longer-run  ranges  theway  Karen Horn does.  They  tend  to  send  a message  about  what  ourstrategy  for monetary  policy  is  over  a longer  period.  And  I reallythink there's  a complacency developing  in  our  country  about  thisinflation problem.  I just  don't  think we  can  afford  to  decide,  evenimplicitly  if not  explicitly, that  we  don't  need  to  be  concerned  aboutthis  inflation  problem  anymore.  I'm  a bit  puzzled  when  people  say  7percent  growth  in  M1  is  a constraining  influence on  the  economy.  Ifour  forecast  for  prices  is  half-way  honest,  we're talking  about  a 4percent  increase  or  less,  and  a 7 percent  increase  in  nominal  M1provides  for  a 3 percent  increase  in  real money  balances.  If you  lookover  the trend  of the  past  20  to  25  years,  you'll  find that  the  growthrate  of  real  M1  has  a trend  of  less  than  1 percent  a year.  So,  Iwould like  to  stay  with these  targets.  If the  economy turns  outnowhere  near  the  lines  of  the  staff  forecast  and  it's  much weaker,  Iwould be  prepared  later  on  to  see  growth of  M1  exceed that  upperlimit;  but  I don't  want  to  send  that  kind  of message  now.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Morris.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  I agree  with Governor  Gramley.  From thestandpoint  of the  effect  on  expectations,  I think  it  is  wise  normallynot  to  change the  guidelines  unless  there  is  a compelling  reason,  andI don't  see  a  compelling reason to  change the  guidelines.  If we  gettrend  velocity we  can  finance  an  8 percent  nominal  GNP  rise  verycomfortably within  the  alternative  II  guidelines.  I don't  knowwhether we're  going to  get  trend velocity or  not.  If  we  don't--if weget  an  aberrant  velocity behavior--we may  have  to  change theguidelines within  the  year.  But  I don't  think we  ought  to  assumeanything other  than trend  velocity at  this  point  in  time.  And  I thinkalternative  II  would meet  our  economic  objectives  very  easily  giventhat  assumption.

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  There's  a tremendous  unanimity  amongnonmembers.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  That  augurs  well  for next  year!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think we  get  into  this  problem partlybecause  I suspect  the  inflation  forecast  is  too  high--not to  beat  adead  horse  anymore.  There's  room  for  real  growth  under  any  of thealternatives  in  here  [if we  had]  more  modest  inflation  assumptions.The  choice  boils  down  to  this.  I'm not  going to  make everybody  happy;we  have  four  targets  here  and  12  members  and  the  permutations  andcombinations  of that  grouping  are  enormous.  The  only proposal  I canmake  is  to  stick with  something like  alternative  II;  I don't  know howmany people  that would make  directly happy.  Most  people  have  beenfocusing on  M1,  so  we  can  talk about  modifying some  of those  otherranges  if that's  important.  But  I would  also  say that  we  ought  togive  the message--we  do that  in the  short-term targets,  I suppose--that  we  don't mind  being above  that  cone  for the  time  being.  I wouldbe  inclined,  in  the interest  of  reconciliation if nothing else,  and  it2/12-13/85-44-we  wouldn't necessarily be  unhappy  if  growth were  in the  upper  part  ofthe  range.  I don't  like  the  sentence  that's  there now;  and  I don'tknow why we  should  single  out  M1  given  all  the  comments  either.  I'dhave  a sentence  to the  effect  that:  "The  Committee  agreed that  growthin  the monetary  aggregates  more  generally in  the  upper  parts  of theirranges  for  1985  may  be  appropriate,  depending upon"  something.  Oneapproach would  be  to  use  "provided inflationary  tendencies  remainsubdued."  But  I might  say  something  about business  too.  I don't  knowquite  what  we  should  say.  I don't  think we  want  to  say  "would beappropriate  provided  business  is  weak."  That  sounds  a little  odd.It's  the  fact  of the matter, but  it  might  suggest  we're  anticipatingsomething in  that  connection.Let  me  just  try  this.  We  have  a majority  that  wantssomething like  alternative  II;  it's  not  a very  large  majority but  someof those  said  they  didn't want  to  put  in  anything  about  being  in  theupper  part  of the  range.  The  obvious  accommodation  is  something  likealternative  II  but  some  acknowledgment that  growth  in  the  upper  partof the  range might  be  possible.  I wouldn't  put  it  as  an  aim;  I'd  sayit  might  be  appropriate  under  certain  conditions.  An alternative,  ashas  been  expressed,  is  to  go  to  something  like  4 to  7-1/2  percent  andnot  say  anything  about  being  in  the upper  part.  Let  me  try  broadlythose  two  alternatives.  We'll  return  to  fine  tuning M3  and  creditlater.  Looking  at  M1:  Who  would  have  a preference  for  leaving  it  at  4to  7 percent  but  with  some  acknowledgment--the  precise  language to  bedetermined--first  of  all,  that  running  above  the  range  now  isn'thorribly prejudging  the  short-term decision;  and  secondly,  that  wewouldn't  be  amazed  and may  well  find  it  desirable to  be  in the  upperpart  of  the  range,  depending  on  how things  develop?  To  have  aspecific  acknowledgement  of  that  is  one  alternative.  The  otheralternative would  be  just  to  go  to  4 to  7-1/2  percent  and  leave  it  atthat.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  With  respect  to  the  first  alternative,  are  youcontemplating putting  it  in writing  or  doing  it  in your  testimony?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Right  now  I'm  contemplating  putting itinto  writing.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Well,  you're  going to  testify within--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  could  be  done  in the  testimony,  butwhat  I'm  proposing  at  the  moment  is  that  some  sense  of  that  be writteninto  the  directive.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I'd  prefer  not  to  go  that  way.  I'd  rather  go  tothe  7-1/2  percent,  if  those  are  the only  alternatives  you  aresuggesting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I guess  I want  to  concentrate  on themembers  at  the  moment.  Who would  prefer  what?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  I have  a strong  preference  for  thefirst.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I have  a  strong  preference  for  the  second.2/12-13/85-45-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  let's  raise  hands.  How many  have  apreference  for the  first?  Five.  How many have  a preference  for  thesecond?  Five.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I don't  need  to  have  a preference  for  either,do  I?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Two  things were  presented to  you.  I don'tknow what  you  like  and  [unintelligible].  If  you have  anotherpreference  that  commands more  support,  that's--

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Without  committing, if  I had  to  choose  betweenthe  two,  then  I would  take  the  first.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  let  me  go  to  the  fine  tuning.  Whatdo  people  feel  about  M2  or  M3  and  total  credit?  I don't  know that  wereally want  to  raise  the  range  for  total  credit;  it's  already awfullyhigh.  It  may  be  exceeded.  I don't  know what  kind  of messages wewould  be  sending  by  raising  the  total  credit  figures  at  this  point.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I think  it's  a  recognition of  the  unexpectedsize  of  the  inflow of  capital  from abroad.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Are  people  talking  about  9 to  12percent?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Pardon?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Were  you  suggesting  raising  that?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  To  9 to  12  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  I thought  you were  talking  about  9-1/2  to  12-1/2percent,  as  in  alternative  I.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I said  that  seemed  a little  steep.  But  I wasnot  speaking  of  the numbers;  I was  speaking  of the  reason why  we  wouldrecognize that  they were  high  numbers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I'm  not  sure  of  that  reason,  but  he has  meconfused  on  it.  Does  anybody want  to  raise  that  from 9 to  12  percent?

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  Does  anyone want  to  raise  it?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Above  9 to  12  percent?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Above  9 to  12  percent.  All  right,  that's9 to  12  percent.  On M3  you  expressed that  opinion.  Do  other  peoplewant  to  raise the M3  range?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  I wouldn't  be  bothered by  1/2  point[higher]  on  that  just  because  I'm  not  sure  what's  going  to  happen  toit.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Everybody  knows  we  studiously  ignore M3  anyway,so  whether we  have  6 to  9 percent  or  6 to  33  percent  or  whatever--

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Since  it  doesn't  matter,  why not  raise  it?2/12-13/85-46-

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Then,  nobody  is  bothered by  raising  it  to9-1/2  percent?

SEVERAL.  No.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  Did you  say  6-1/2  to  9-1/2  percent?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.  Well,  6-1/2 to  9-1/2  percent  or  6 to9-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  That's what  I want;  I want  the  9-1/2  percent  highend.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  Why  don't  we make  it  6 percent  to whatever?

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  6 percent  or  more.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  M2?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I think we're  going to  have  trouble withthat  at  6 to  8-1/2  percent.  I would  prefer  6 to  9 percent.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I would  too.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  I would  too.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  I would  too.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  I definitely would  not.  I simply  don'tunderstand why we  have  to  raise  all  the  ranges,  or  almost  all  of them,when we've  had  lower  inflation than expected.  It  seems  to  me  adevastating  signal.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  provides  for  a  little more  room  for  realgrowth.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Sure.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I don't  see  anything wrong with  that  myself.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  You want  to  maximize  growth  and  take  theinflation that  that  eventually would  provide?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  The  problem is  that  if  you  allow  forreal  growth  of more than  4 percent,  I think  you have to  forget  aboutthe  targets  in  one  sense  and  ask yourself the  question:  What's  likelyto  be  going  on  in  the  economy  over  some  period  of time?  I'm nottalking  about  a quarter,  but  if  over  a period  of  time  the  economy  isgrowing  by  more  than 4 percent,  it  seems  to me  that  in thecircumstances  we're  faced  with right  now--leaving  aside  the magic  ofthese targets--the  outcome  may well  be  one  that  is  going to  put  morepressure  on  financial markets  and  interest  rates.  And  it's  going tosubvert  our  effort  to  try and  create  a policy  environment  in which wecan  keep  the  economy  growing  at  4 percent  for  a  long time.  That's  oneof  the things  that worries  me,  Chuck.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  to me  4 percent  is  desirable  and  4-1/2percent  is  acceptable.  We're  starting  off with an  unemployment  rate2/12-13/85-47-of  7.4  percent.  There was  talk about  that  being the  full  employmentlevel;  I certainly  don't  agree  with that.  I think  we have  room to  godown;  I don't  think we  know;  we  have to  probe  and  see.  I think weprobably  could  have  4-1/2  percent  growth  for  this  year withoutdifficulty.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Again,  that's  another  possibility.The  problem  I have  is  that  the higher  we  set  the  targets  the moredifficult it  will  be to  react  in  some  coherent  way  if things  break  onthe  up  side.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  But  if they  break  on  the up  side,  we're  going togo  right  through  the upper  ends  of these  ranges.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  we  had  5.6  percent  real  growth  lastyear  and  inflation  at  3.5  percent  with  5.2  percent  M1  growth.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  A very unusual  year.  I don't  think  it  will  berepeated.Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  That's  because  velocity went  up  4 percent,  Mr.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I know it  did.  That's  why--

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  If  you  believe  it's  only  going up  1 percent  thisyear,  then  you have  to  allow  for  more  growth  of money.  I think it's--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Who  said  it's  going to  go  up  1 percentthis  year?

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  I said  if  you think it  might.  That's  what  I'massuming  ranges  are  for:  to  allow  for  realistic  possibilities.  We'renot  committed to  go  to  the  upper  end  by  setting  it  1/2  percentagepoint  higher, but  it  allows  us  to  in  case  that  develops,  as  our  staffand the  Board  staff  seem to  think  is  likely.  If  it  doesn't,  so  muchthe  better.  We're  not  committed  to  going  to  7 or  7-1/2  percent.Governor  Wallich  raised the  question:  Why  are  we  increasing  ourranges?  My  answer to  that,  Henry,  would  be  that  it  appears  to  us  thatthe  demand  for  money  is  increasing  and  one  should  allow for  that  inthe  determination  of the  ranges.  If we  don't,  I think we'll  get  thekind  of  results  we  did  in  the  first  half  of  1982  when we  tightened  upat  a time  that,  in  my  opinion, we  should  not  have  and we  drove  theeconomy  into  a deeper  recession than might  otherwise have  been thecase.  And  it  was  because,  in  my  case  at  least,  of  a belatedrecognition that  the  velocity  of money was  declining.  I don't  want  tomake  that  mistake  again.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  It  wasn't  declining  last  year;  and  7 percent  M1growth was  associated  during  the  '70s  with  rapidly  acceleratinginflation.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Well,  the  faster the  rate  of  growth  in  money thelower  the  velocity  is  going to  be,  necessarily;  it's  just  anarithmetic  truth.  If  we hit  the  top  part  of  the  target  we're  going  tohave  lower  velocity.  If we  hit  the midpoint,  we're  going to  havehigher  velocity.  I think  either way we  can  finance  it.  But  if we  hitthe  top  part,  then  somewhere  along the way  velocity  is  going to  return2/12-13/85-48-to  a somewhat  normal  pace,  I would  assume.  And  that's  where thetrouble  comes  in.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  I think  we  ought  to  have  a lot  of  humilityaround this  table  in  forecasting  velocity.  It  seems  to me  that  all  wecan do  is  assume that  we're  going  to  get  trend velocity;  anything elseis  pure  speculation.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  trouble  is  we  don't  even know what  thetrend  is.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Well,  I would think the more  the humility youhave  the wider the  range  you would want.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Why  should we  be  more  humble now  than we wereat midyear?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I'm  going  to  defer  this  vote  untilwe  do  the  short  run.  Maybe  that  will  put  some  light  on what  we shoulddo.  Will  you introduce the  short  run,  Mr. Axilrod?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Well, Mr.  Chairman,  I will  be  referring,  ofcourse,  to  the  table  on  page  10  [of the  Bluebook].  Most  of thesealternatives, depending  on  what  you  perceive  the  Committee  is  willingto  do  for  the  rest  of the  year,  would  be  consistent  in  the  long  runwith  the  range  of  alternatives  that  the  Committee is  now discussing.In  a sense,  I suppose  alternative B would be  viewed  as  most  consistentsince that  alternative  assumes,  if we're  right  about  our  estimates  ofM1  relationships  to  reserve  conditions,  very  little  change  inunderlying  short-term  interest  rates  and  reserve  conditions,  typifiedby  a level  of borrowing  in  the  neighborhood of  $300  million  over thenext  several  weeks.  We  expect  that that  would be  doable with  an  8percent  growth  in  M1.  I might  add,  although  I don't  know if  thechicken's  entrails  are  [of  interest]  to  the  Committee,  that  ourmonthly model  would  suggest  somewhat  higher  growth  of M1  over  thebalance  of  this  period--perhaps  a couple  of  points  higher.  On theother hand,  the  quarterly model,  left  to  its  own  devices,  wouldsuggest  that  growth  over the  quarter  would  be  a lot  less  than  we'reestimating here.  The  growth  implied here  would  give you a negativevelocity--on the  order  of  [minus]  1-1/4  percent--assuming GNP  is  aboutas  we have  projected  now for  the  first  quarter.  That would  be,  in  asense,  a partial  offset to  the  positive  velocity  on  the  order  of  3percent  in  the  fourth  quarter  and would  be,  on  average,  obviouslyclose  to  1 percent.  We  expect  also  a substantial  slowdown in  M2  andM3  growth  in February  and  March  largely  for the  reason  given  earlier:that  the  drop  in  offering  rates  on MMDAs  and  money market  funds  iscatching  up  with the  drop  in  market  rates.  Indeed,  market  rates  haverisen  about  25  basis  points  recently  so  they  are  accelerating thatcatch-up.  So,  we  would  expect  M2  and  M3  growth to  slow  substantially.All  this  is  assuming  funds  are  trading  around  8-1/4  percent  and  notthe  average  of  about  8-1/2  percent  of  the  last  two  weeks.  But  thoserelationships,  as  the  Committee  knows,  are  rather  loose  and  dependvery much  on how the market  perceives  money supply  and businessconditions  and how  that might  feed back  and  be  affecting  Fed  policyover  the  very  short  run.  Mr.  Chairman, that  very briefly  sums  up  theessential  points  contained  in  [the  Bluebook].2/12-13/85-49-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Apart  from the  numerology here,  I think  asusual  the decision  at  the  moment  is:  Do  we want  to  tighten  up,  easeup,  or  leave policy  unchanged  in  the  immediate  future?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  In  terms  of  the  level  of borrowing,  this  issurely  a policy  that  can  hardly  be  eased  any  further.  The  borrowingfigure  is  very  low.  In terms  of  the  funds  rate  to  which thisborrowing  relates,  I think  it's  true  that  that's  still  a rather highnumber  relative  to  the  rate  of  inflation.  I see  no  reason  to  want  toraise the  funds  rate  at  this  time,  but  neither would  I want  it  to  godown;  nor would  I want  to  do  something with the  discount  rate.  So,I'd  come  out  with  "B."

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I would  agree  with  "B"  also;  I would  agree withwhat  Henry  said--that the  current  situation  is  adequate.  It  looks  asif we're  getting  a pretty  good  recovery,  somewhat  shaded by  thatretail  sales  report  this morning.  But  the  rate  of  growth still  seemsadequate.  I would  point  out  that  we've  been bordering  on  the highside  of monetary  growth  and,  when  I say  "remain unchanged,"  I have  inmind  a moving down  in  the  rates  of monetary  growth  of the  sort  thatthe  staff  is  projecting  for the  quarter.  If  that  didn't  occur,  Ithink it  would  give  us  trouble.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr. Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I ditto  what  Chuck just  said.

[SECTION]

MR.  RICE.  So  do  I.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  So  do  I.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I go  along  with  "B,"  Mr.  Chairman.  My  onlyreservation with  regard to  "B" is  what  the band  of  confidence  isaround  the  8 percent  December-to-March  number  for  M1.  It  seems  to  methat  the  odds  are  that  M1  will  exceed  8 percent.  My only  discomfortis  that  8-1/4  percent  may not  be the  correct  fed  funds  rate  for  theshort  run;  maybe  it  should  be  8-1/2  percent.  But  I take  it  that thereis  enough flexibility  built  into  our  procedures  [to  allow for]  an8-1/2  percent  rate  if we  need  it  to  get  8 percent  [M1  growth]  orwhatever that  is--less  than the  10  percent  and  12  percent  that  we'vebeen  experiencing  in  recent  months.  Given that  assumption,  I would  goalong with  "B."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Boykin.

[SECTION]

MR. BOYKIN.  I would  go  with  "B" also.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Black.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think  it  is  desirable  for us  totry  to  end  the  year  at  the  midpoint  of  alternative  II,  so  I tend toBy  the  same  token,  I have  somefavor  the  short-run M1 path  of  "C." leanings toward  "B"  too,  because  I don't  believe  it  would be  desirablenecessarily  to  move  to  the  kind  of borrowing  target  that  "C"contemplates  in  the  Bluebook.  Edging  on  up  toward  the  $400  millionborrowing  level  would  be  as  much as  I'd  want  to  do.  Perhaps  moreimportant  than that,  I'd  want  those words  on  lines  93  and  99--where wehave  the  choice between  "would" and  "might"--to be  "would" in  both2/12-13/85-50-cases.  I don't  think we  know which way  it's  going to  be  and  I'd  liketo  see  us  be  prepared  to  move  in  either  direction,  if the  aggregatesare  not  staying on  the target.  I think  the  phrase  at  the  beginningshould be  "increase  slightly;"  that  would  be  preferable  to what  isshown  in  "C." I'm  not  thinking  about  very much  action  at  this  point  and that  oughtto  be  fully  adequate  to  encompass  anything I have  in mind.And  I would  go  with the  funds  rate  range  of  "B" because

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  "Increase  slightly" for  pressure on  reservepositions?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Balles.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  same  factors  thatinfluenced me  on my views  on the  long-term ranges  are  coming  intoplay,  particularly in  the  short  term here.  My  view, and  I hope  it  iscorrect,  is  that  we're  experiencing  an increase  in  the  demand  formoney  as  a direct  reflection  and  delayed  reaction to  the  drop  ininterest  rates  in  the  latter part  of last  year.  To  slow money downfrom  the  rapid  growth  rates  of December  and  January  would  require  aconsiderable  increase  in  interest  rates,  which  I don't  want  to  see,particularly  in view  of the precarious  situation of  agriculturalloans,  international  loans--the whole  shooting match.  Therefore,  forthis  period  and  this  period  alone,  I would  come  out  in  favor  ofalternative  A  for  the  short-term specifications.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Mr.  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR.  FORRESTAL.  Mr.  Chairman,  of  the three  alternatives  thatyou presented--tightening,  loosening,  or  staying  the  same--I  think theproper  course  for  policy  at  the moment  is  steady  as  we  go.  We  haveanother  meeting  of this  Committee  within a  relatively short  time,  atthe  end  of March.  I think  there  is  enough  time  to  allow  the  situationto  unfold  and  to  wait  and  see what  happens.  If  I have  a bias,  itwould  be  for  eliminating the  tilt  toward  accommodation.  And  if we  got[money  growth]  at  the  upper  end  of the  range,  I would  hope that  wewould  be  prepared to  move more  promptly  against  that  rather  than theother  way.  But  I think  it  is  important  that  we  stay  steady  for  thetime  being,  and  I guess  that's  associated with  alternative  B  and  itsspecifications.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Like  Chuck,  I'm worried  about  how fast  money isgrowing now  and  I hope  we're  going  to  get that  slowed  down.  I'm notat  all  certain  that  I know what  level  of  the  Federal  funds  rate  isgoing to  do  that.  I'm  reluctant  to  see  policy  shift  from onedirection to  another  abruptly,  and  I can  go  along with  "B" with theunderstanding that  if,  in  fact,  we  get money  growth  above thosenumbers,  we  begin to  snug up  a bit.I would  like  to  call  the  Committee's  attention  to  thelanguage  of  the  operational paragraph  with  respect  to  what  it  saysabout  economic  activity.  I think we  need  a change  there.  What  wehave  there talks  about  an  easier policy  in  the  context  of  sluggishgrowth  in  economic  activity and  greater  restraint  if  indications  ofsignificant  strengthening  of  economic  activity  occurred.  If we  leavethat wording,  it  seems  to  be  saying  that we  still  think  the  economy  is2/12-13/85-51-sluggish  and  I don't  think  that's what  we  ought  to  say;  we  ought  tohave  a more  neutral  set  of  phrases  than  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Anybody  else  have  anything to  say?

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  I favor  alternative  B.  I do  share  concerns withsome  of  the  people  around  the  table that  we  have  had  3 months  ofstrong M1  growth  and  that  by the  end  of March  it  could  be  more like  5months.  And  at  that  point  my concerns  would  be  greater  about  thedirection  of M1  growth.  But  for  the  time  being  I favor  "B."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Garbarini.

[SECTION]

MR. GARBARINI.  I would  also  favor  "B,"  and  I would  prettymuch  echo  Bob  Black's  comments:  I also  have  a  little more concernabout  the  accommodation  and,  therefore,  lean  a little more toward  "C."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Miss  Seger.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  I can  handle  no  change  from  the present  [stance],if that's  what  alternative B  is.  I would be  concerned,  though,  if nochange  brought  about  a substantial  rise  in the  fed  funds  rate  becauseof how  that  is  interpreted in  the  markets  as  a signal  of what  we'redoing and  also  because  of  the  very  severe  problem with the  superdollar  and  some  of  the  other  special  factors  that  I've  mentionedbefore.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr.  Guffey.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  I'd  also  choose  alternative  B.  The  onlyquestion  that  I would  have  with respect  to  alternative  B is  the  $300million  borrowing  level  that  the  staff  associates with  an  8-1/4percent  funds  rate.  I would  just  point  out  the  pattern  of  seasonalborrowing between  now and  the  next  meeting.  If  you just  take  1984,for  example,  seasonal  borrowing went  to  a very  low level  of  roughly$150  million by the  end  of the period.  If we're  at  or  near  africtional  level  of  borrowing  now and  we  get  $150  million  of  seasonalborrowing, then that  suggests  to  me  that  the  funds  rate  might welldrop  below the  [8-1/4]  percent.  We would  have  a hard  time  holding  itthere without  some  additional--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  What  is  seasonal  borrowing  now--$60  or  $70million?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  level  of  seasonal borrowing  has  been about  $60million  over  the  past  4 or  5 weeks.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  Yes,  in  January;  and  then  historically it  beginsto  move  up.  For  example,  at  the  end  of March  in  1984  it  was  $150million  after  starting  the  year  at  or  about  the  same  level  [as  thisyear]. borrowing  alone,  which  may  complicate  Desk operations  if  [adjustment]borrowings  are  at  or  near  a frictional  level  now.So  there's  an  increase  of  about  $100  million  in  seasonal

MR. KEEHN.  Well,  I was  in  favor of  alternative  II  before  andalternative  B here  seems  to  fit  that  pattern  appropriately.  So,  forthe  reasons  I've  stated,  I'd  be  in  favor  of alternative  B.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Anybody  else?  Mr.  Gainor.

[SECTION]

MR.  GAINOR.  We  too  would  favor  alternative  B.  If  we  weregoing  to  fine tune  it,  however,  we  would  move  to  the direction  of  "C,"probably to  7-3/4  percent  or  something like  that  [for  M1].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Mr. Morris,  we're  left  without  a commentfrom  you.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Well,  I would  buy  alternative  B.  I think Rogerhas  made a very  good  point  that the  borrowing  target  ought  to  behigher  than  $300  million--more  like  $400  million.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  I think we  need  to  develop  fairly  promptlya view as  to  the  kind  of weight  we  give  to  seasonal borrowing.  It'snot  zero  and  it's  not  a hundred;  it's  something  in  between.  Ofcourse,  we  could  have  an  unusual  increase  in  seasonal  borrowing----and  we  need  to  know how to  evaluate  that  if  it  occurs.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [Unintelligible]  we've  really  had  adifferent  program for  seasonal  borrowing, we'd have  to  take  account  ofit.  It's  going to  develop  in  the  next  five  weeks.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  What  we  present,  of course,  always  assumes  anormal  seasonal  in  a sense.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes.  Well,  this  just  reminds  me  that  it'ssomething we  ought  to be  looking  at.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  in  this  case,  we  seem  to  have  agreat  degree  of  unanimity  about  alternative  B,  whatever  that  means.Let  me  interpret  alternative  B.  Borrowing  is  roughly  around  $300million.  It  has  been  running  a little  above  $300  million,  actually,so  I would  think  alternative B  is  consistent  with  something  like  $300to  $400  million,  depending  upon  the tone  and  feel  of  the markets,including the  exchange market.  If  the  evidence  accumulated  in thenext  few weeks  that  we're  distinctly  above  it,  the  tendency would  beto  tighten a bit.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Above  on  the  aggregates?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  above  these  numbers  for  theaggregates.  But  probably we  would  not  move very  aggressively at  thispoint.  It  sounds  fine  in  concept.  If  this  happened  coinciding withweak business  news  and  a strong  dollar,  I would  have  some  questionabout  it.  At  least  at  this  point  I would  interpret  this  as  notabsolutely automatic  if those  two  condition  arose.  But  thepresumption would  be  in that  direction.  The  prospects  of  easing,  Ithink,  are  substantially  less  in  the  sense that  we  would  have  to  haveslower  growth  in the  aggregates  than  suggested in  alternative  B  plusgreater  concerns  about  the  business  picture  than  have  been  expressedaround this  table.  That's  what  I would  interpret  alternative  B  tomean.  Does  that  differ  widely  from what  anybody  else  thinks?  I2/12-13/85-53-attempted  to  incorporate this  into  a  somewhat  rewritten directive  butI don't  have  any copies  of  that.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  we  have  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You might  take  a look  at  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I think Lyle's  point  was  good  about  thosemodifiers  on the  business  situation.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I have  a  suggestion for  a way  of  dealing withthat  that's  fairly  neutral,  and  that  is--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I rewrote  the  whole thing.  I gaggeda little  at  saying  "maintain" the  degree  of  reserve  pressure  when  it'ssomething  of  a euphemism to  say  we have  any  reserve  pressure  at  themoment.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  It  should  read:  "the absence  of  reserve[pressures]."

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  "The  same  reserve  posture."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  I made  it  "maintain reserveconditions."  Presumably,  this  would  be--what  do  we  have  there:  8percent  and  10-1/2  percent  and  9-3/4  percent?  Those  are  awfullyprecise  fractions.  I doubt  whether we  generally  put  "3/4s"  in  there,do  we?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Not  really.  We  get  hung  up  with  maintainingdifferences  among  the  alternatives  consistent with what  our modeltells  us.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  [Unintelligible]  number  of  models  you  look  at.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I would  be  sorely tempted  to  say  10percent  for both  of them,  just  to  round  them off.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Wouldn't  it  require  quite  a substantial  slowingof  M2  growth to  get  10  percent,  Steve?

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  it  slows  to  9 percent  and  then  to  7-3/4percent  to  get  10-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  January was  pretty high?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  January was  14-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  14-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Technically, we  could  separate  out  the  M1,M2,  and  M3  and  say  something  like:  "Growth of M1  would  be  at  an  annualrate  of  around  8 percent,  and  growth  of  M2  and  M3"  etc.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  The  only word  I stumble  over  a bitis  "limited."  Could  that  be  made  "gradual"  or  "moderate" or--2/12-13/85-54-

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I do  too.  Maybe  "some."  And then  for  theeasing  sentence  [rather  than]  "might be  acceptable,"  I think we oughtto  say  "would be  acceptable"  under those  conditions  you  havespecified.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  this  is  [unintelligible]  the  fact  that  Ithink of  it  in  a deliberately  asymmetrical manner.  Wouldn't  "might"and  also  the word  "substantially"--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  I thought  "substantially"--

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I think  it  should be  symmetrical  given theunknowns  we're mulling over  here.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  I favor  symmetry  but if we  must be  asymmetrical,I think this  is  the  right  direction.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I didn't  mind the  "substantially slowergrowth"  but  then might  "be  acceptable  in  the  event  of  substantiallyslower  growth  in the monetary aggregates,  sluggish  growth  in  economicactivity, and  continued  strength  of the  dollar"?  I thought  "might"was  perhaps  a little  reserved.  Lyle,  I think that  does take  care  ofyour  problem.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  Yes.  Where  the term  "sluggish growth"  fallsnow, since  it's  second,  it  doesn't  seem  to  say  that  we've  failed tonotice  what  has  happened  so  far.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  could  put  in  a sentence  on  theaggregates  and  say  something  like  this:  "Should  growth  in M1  appear tobe  exceeding  an  annual  rate  of  around  8 percent  and  M2  and  M3  a rateof  around  10 to  11  percent."

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  12  percent  down  from 14--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  10  to  11  percent  is  okay.  I think that  isreasonably  stated.  We're  going  to  get  a slowing in M2  growth;  there'sno  doubt  about  that.  But  I think it  will  be hard  to  get  it  within  thequarter  when  one month  is  14-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  know how we  should  describe thisincrease  in  reserve  pressures.  I was  looking for  a word  that  said  weweren't  going to  be  terribly aggressive  about  it  in  the next  fiveweeks.  Given  the  conditions,  a "modest  increase"--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  "Some  increase"  is  pretty  indefinite.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "Some"  isn't  necessarily  "modest."  Whatword  do  we  typically use?  It's  probably  "some,"  isn't  it?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  I think it  is  "some."

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  How about  "some  limited"?2/12-13/85-55-

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I think  "limited"  captures  the  spirit  of whatwe've  been  talking about.  If  we  did  anything terribly  aggressive,  Iwould  think that we'd  want  a consultation.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Maybe  it's  a matter  of  semantics.["Limited"  sounds  as]  if there  is  a predetermined  point  beyond  whichwe  would not  go  in  any  circumstance.  It's  partly the  semantics  of itthat  I'm reacting to.  I am  not  talking  about  being  aggressive  oranything like  that,  but  I think a word  like  "gradual"  or  "some"  isjust  more  in  [tune]  with the  kind  of approach  we  take to  these  things.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I think  the  message  is  that  we're  giving  this  alittle  tap;  we're  not  letting  the  10  to  12  percent  run  but  we're  notreversing  course.  Isn't  that what  we're  trying  to  get  at?  That'swhat  "some"  says.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  in  a sense.  But  I think  "some"  isprobably what  we  use  all  the time  when we've  made big  changes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  says  "pressures."  We  could  change  it  to"conditions"  as  it  has  previously been.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  can't  say  "increases in  conditions."

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  I was  going  to  add--you may  not  care  forthis--that  we  could  say  "some  snugging up."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You're  right.  I don't  care  for  that.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  It  sounds  a little  obscene.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it  has  been pointed  out  to me thatthe  typical  version  uses  "somewhat  greater  or  somewhat  lesser."

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Well,  so  long  as  we  all  understand what's  goingto  happen.  This  language  is  going to  come  out  after the fact  anyway.I think the  point  to  be  made is  the one  that  Jerry made:  that  if wesay  "limited,"  the  public  may  say  that  we  had  a certain  degreespecified  and  would  go  no  further  beyond  that.  We  still  want  tomaintain the  idea  that  we  have  the  ability to  respond  to  what  ishappening.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  It's  conveying that  sense  offluidity,  even  if  we  don't--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Actually, the  suggestion  "some  limited"  israther  better  with respect  to  that.  "Some  limited  increase  in  reservepressures" doesn't  have  the precision.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  could  go  with  "modest" or  "somemodest."

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  We  would have  to  say  "some  modest."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's more than  "modest."

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  What  about  saying  "reserve pressures  would beincreased  somewhat,  particularly  if business  activity"--2/12-13/85-56-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that  sounds  like  more  to me.  Iunderstand  it  won't  be  published until  later,  but  that's  what  wealways  say.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I think  the  word  "modest"--.  Say  "modestincreases  would  be  sought."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  if  this  is  where  we  are,  do  we makethat  sentence  "Should  growth  in M1  appear  to be  exceeding  an  annualrate  of  around  8 percent  and  M2  and  M3  a  rate  of  around  10  to  11percent  during  the  period  from December  to  March,  modest  increases  inreserve  pressures  will  be  sought,  particularly"  etc.?  And  then  say"lesser  restraint  on  reserve  positions  would be  acceptable"  and  keepthe  federal  funds  range  at  6 to  10  percent.  Is  that  where  we  are?This  does  imply,  unless  I'm wrong,  that  we  will  remain  above  thiscone.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Oh yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  And  in  all  cases,  I guess.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  If  the  cone  is  4 to  7 percent,  it  comes  out  asa projection that  by March  the  level  is  something  like  $3-1/2  billionabove  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Mr.  Chairman,  would  you consider  adding  somewords  to  the  directive,  such  as  you talked  about  a  little  earlier,  toindicate that  conditions might  arise where  we  wish to  be  above thatlimit?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think this  implies  that we  would  beabove the  upper  limit.  But  I will  return  to  that  in the  longer-termexpect  to  be  above  the  upper  limit  of the  cone  in the  early  part  ofthe  year.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  That  would take  away a  lot  of  the  uncertaintyand  speculation  and  guesswork in  the  market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think we  should  say  it,  if we  havethis  kind  of  short-term directive.  I think  I'd  probably  say  it  intestimony.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  It's  much better  to  say  it  in the testimonybecause  that way  the message  gets  to  the  public  and  you want  it  to.Otherwise,  it's  too  late.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I think we  should  say  it  in both  places.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I worry about  this  in  the  testimony:I don't  know how  to  word  it.  We  haven't  exactly  tightened  but  in theprocess  of  stopping  the  ease  we're  a little  snugger  than we  were.  Idon't  know quite  what  word  to  use  to  convey  the  nuance.  It's  hardly  asnug.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  If  you want  to  get  a chuckle,  say  it  just  thatway.2/12-13/85-57-

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I thought  the term of  art  this  season was"tilt."  We  have  removed  the tilt.

[SECTION]

MR. KEEHN.  If  we're  contemplating  a shift  to  parallel  lines,do  you  have to  spend  a lot  of  time talking  about  where we  are  inrelationship  to  the  cone?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  I think we  have  to  leave  the  cone.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  it's  implied.  I take  it  we're  readyto  vote  on  this.  Then we'll  have  coffee.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.Chairman  Volcker Vice  Chairman  Corrigan President  Balles President  Boehne President Boykin Governor  Gramley President Horn Governor  Martin Governor  Partee Governor  Rice Governor  Seger Governor  Wallich YesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYes

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I must  say  just  for  the  record,  and  I'msure  it's  apparent to  all  of you,  that  the  exchange  market has  moreprominence  in  this  directive than  it  has  ever had.  It  has  beenmentioned  in recent  [announcements  of]  discount  rate  changes,  but--.Let's  have  coffee.[Coffee  break]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Somehow I didn't  get  a great  message  fromouter  space  as  to  how to  resolve  this  long-range  target  while  eatingdoughnuts.  I continue  to  believe  that what  comes  the closest  tocapturing the central  tendency is  leaving the  4 to  7 percent.  Wecould  raise  M2  and  M3--at least  the  upper  ends--by  a 1/2  point,  ifthat  makes  people  feel  happier.  We would make  some  note that  growthis  going to  be  running  above  the  cone.  I don't  think  we have  to  saythat  in  the  directive;  I could  say  in  the  testimony  that we're  runningahead  of the  cone  in  the  early part  of the year  and we  expect  that.  Ithink that's  normal  and  reasonable  under  all  conditions.  And we  wouldhave  some  reference,  probably,  in  the  directive that  it might  beacceptable to  be  in the  upper part  of  the  range,  but  make it  short  ofsaying we're  aiming for that.  I don't  think we  have  to  say  what  we'reaiming for,  conclusively,  9 months  from  now.  We  review it  again  atmidyear.  If  we  really  find  that  velocity is  not  right,  then we  mayhave  to  change  the  target  in  the  middle  of  the year;  we've  had  someexperience  in  doing that.  But, meanwhile,  we  give  a reasonablesignal.  And it  all  comes  against  the  background that  I would  like  togive  a little more  confident  view  as  to  the  inflation  outlook,  which  Iwill  for myself  [in  my  testimony].  Therefore,  it  makes  all  thesenumbers  fit  better.So,  I will  try  again:  something like  4 to  7 percent,  with amodifier  in  the  directive, which we  don't  have  precise  language  for2/12-13/85-58-yet;  I'm fairly  indifferent  on M2  and M3  but  if  it  really makes  peoplefeel  better  to  add  another  1/2  point,  I don't  think  that  does  us  anygrave  damage  one  way  or  the  other;  total  credit  looks  awfully  high tome,  but  I guess  we  could  leave  it  where  it  is.  Let's  see whether  wecan  proceed  on that  basis.  Let me  ask a  preliminary  question.  Anumber  of people  said  they  would  rather  have  4 to  7-1/2  percent  or  4to  8 percent  but they may  or  may  not  have  wanted  another  1/2  point  onM2  and  M3.  Does  it  make any  of those  people  happier  to  have  another1/2  on M2  and  M3?

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  I'd  much  prefer  it  on  M1,  Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That's  not  what  I asked.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  We  could  have  it  on M1  and  drop  it  from M2  andM3.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  I could  go  along with that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  I think the trouble  with that  isthat  it's  probably  contrary to  where  the  probabilities  lie.  Theprobabilities  are  that M2  and M3  are more  likely  to  exceed  [the  upperends  of the  ranges]  than M1.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  But  I would  like  to  point  out  to  you, Paul,  thatthe  staff's  M1  projection under  alternative  B is  for  growth  for thefirst  quarter  over  the  fourth  quarter  of  9.2  percent.  If  that's  atall  right,  the  7 percent  is  a considerable  constraint  for  theremainder  of the  year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  know what  it  means  for  themiddle  of  the year  mathematically.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  for three  more  quarters  it  means  about  6percent.percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  There's  no  question  it  means  less  than  7

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  About  6 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  About  6 percent?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  About  6 percent  or  [just]  below that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Sure,  it  takes  all three--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  Mr.  Chairman,  one  thing  that might  help--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  more,  I would  point  out,  than wehad  all  of  last  year  when the  GNP was  rising by  5-1/2  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  could  happen.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  Mr.  Chairman,  one  thing that  might  help  allthose who  are  worried  about  the  7 percent  ceiling would  be what  you2/12-13/85-59-propose  on  the  matter  of the  so-called  parallel  lines  or the bands.My  concern,  specifically--because  we  have  a money market model  whichgives  results very  similar  to  those of  the Board  staff's monthlymodel--is that  the  model  shows  money growth  for  some months  ahead  atdouble-digit  rates.  To  keep  from getting that,  we  estimate we  have  toput  short-term  rates  up  at  least  200  basis  points  or  thereabouts.  Butif we  were  to  adopt  the bands,  that would  take  care  of the  problemearly  in  the year--in the  sense  that we  would be  above  the  cone  butnot  above  that  parallel  line.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I certainly think we  should be  above  thecone  in  these  early months.  Now, just how do  we  draw  it?  We  can  drawparallel  lines;  we  can  draw solid-line  parallel  lines  and  dotted-linecones;  we  can  draw dotted-line  or  solid  cones  and  dotted-line  bands.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  We  could  even use  colors!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  can  draw the  kind  of  thing that  I drew,which is  the way  I tend  to  think  of  it.  It  doesn't make muchdifference  in  where the  line  actually  falls.  I'm  open  to  any  of thosevariants.  I'd  draw the  parallel  lines  without  the  cone,  if that's--

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  I think the discussion  shows  the  danger  of  theband.  The  band  allows  you to  go  at  any  rate  of  speed  during the  earlymonths.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  And  they have to  slow down  later.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  While  I would  ordinarily  say  it  doesn't matterbecause  you know what  you're  doing, here  we're talking  about  it  asthough it  really made  a difference.  We  give  ourselves  more  leeway;  weuse  it  right  away.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  For  a good  reason, though,  I would  say.In  this  particular  case,  we  ended  up  with  a slowdown in  M1  growth  lastyear,  so  it's  quite  natural--it's  a characteristic  of the band--thatwe would  also  be happy  with an  extremely low  growth  in  the  firstquarter,  if  you took it  literally.  We're  not  going  to  get  that,  butwith  just  the  band  itself M1  growth would  still  be  within the  band  ifwe had  zero  growth,  I suppose--or  close to  it--for  this  quarter.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  The  reverse  is  also true,  though.If,  as  John  says,  we  had  double-digit  M1  growth for  several moremonths  running,  you  can  draw your  lines  any way  you want  and  you  haveone  heck of  a problem.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  None  of this  changes  the  fact  that  whatwe're  fixing  is  where  we'd  like  to  be  at  the  end  of the  year.  Indeed,I don't  think  it makes  an  enormous  difference whether  it  is  1/2percentage  point  higher at  the top;  it's  visual.  We're  talking about$2-1/2  billion  of money  supply,  right?

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  The  band  is  a better way to  communicate.  Itessentially  expresses  what we  do.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I have  no  problem with  a band.  I assumethat  at  the  least  we  would  draw a band  along with the cone.2/12-13/85-60-

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Right.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Since  there has  been  discussion  about  it,just  for  the  purpose  of  elucidating how the  two  things  look,  at  aminimum we  would  draw them both.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  And that  would help.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Well,  we  had the  same  problem  at  this  time  lastyear:  January  had  growth  in  the  double-digit  range  and  we  were  abovethe  cone  until  the  end  of the  first  quarter  as  I recall.  I don't knowhow you  explained  it  then  but  it  didn't  seem to  create  great  problems.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  does  anybody  have  some  strikingsuggestion  as  to  how to  draw the  picture  that  they  urgently want  tobring to  our  attention?  Left  to  my own  devices,  I will  draw  some kindof  a band--a  lopsided  band  or  something--along with the  cone.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  It  will  become  known  as  the  Volckergram.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  With a truncated  band.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  If  you  connect  the  extreme  points  of  lastyear's  cone  and  this  year's  cone  and make that  the  band,  you'll  findthat  you  have  a very low  rate  of  growth  in that  connecting  line.  Youwould  be  going  from  something that  rose  8 percent  to  the next  cone,which  would  be  rising  7 percent.  And  the  connecting line,  if  that'sthe  top  of  the  band,  will  be  a lot  flatter than  the  upper  side  ofeither  cone.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  A  little  flatter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  will  be  a little  flatter  than aparallel  line,  but  hardly  enough  to  be  discernable.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Probably  1 percent  flatter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  would be  1 percent  flatter;  well,  itwould  be  3/4  of a  percent  flatter.  And  since we're  not  up  there  atthe  beginning anyway,  it  wouldn't  make much  difference.  The  simplestthing  to  do  is  probably a compromise  between  them.  I might  draw atruncated  line--draw the  cone  with just  a top  parallel  line.

[SECTION]

MR.  BALLES.  I'd  settle  for that.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Where  are  you thinking  about  beginning the  line?You  explained  that  yesterday  and  I thought  I understood  but  I wasn'tquite  certain.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I'm not  saying that  now.  We  wouldjust  make  it  3/4  of  a percent  different.  If  you  draw parallel  lines,they  would  both  rise  at  a 5-1/2  percent  rate  of speed.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Right.2/12-13/85-61-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  The  bottom part  of that  would  be  out  ofsight;  nobody  wants to  go  there initially.  The  only modification  Ihad  was  that  instead  of  a parallel  line,  I'd  draw it  back to  thefourth  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Target.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  [The  fourth-quarter]  target,  which wouldbe  3/4  of  a point  higher  because we  ended  up  below the  midpoint.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Yes,  that's what  I understood you to  say.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  And  that's  all.  The  only  rationale  isthat  I find  it  easy to  explain.  I say  that that  was  last  year'starget  and  we  presumed we  would  have  been  satisfied  to  be  there.Assuming we were  satisfied  to  be  there,  we  want  to  have  somecontinuity  to  the  next  year.  We  know where we  want  to  be  at  the  endof  this  year, we  decided where  we  wanted  to  be  at  the  end  of  lastyear,  and  that's  just  a line  that  happens  to  connect  those two  targetsthat  we  happened  to  agree  upon.  It's  no  big deal,  and maybe  it  does--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It  creates  lots  of  room, all  right.

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  It  sure  does.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You're  looking  at  these  early months

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes,  and  we're well  within  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  we're  not  all  that  much within  it,since--are  we?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  if  I understand the  way  you're  going  todraw  it,  we're  a good  deal  more within  it  than with  parallel  lines.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  it's  more  than  with  parallel  lines.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  would  be  3/4  of  a percentage  point morewithin  it  than--

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Well,  that  is  just  connecting the  points  here.When  I look  at  the--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You're  unquestionably  right  in  direction;I just  don't  know how  far  it  will  go.  I'd  have  to  look  at  it.  Whereare  these  great  pictures  [in  the  Bluebook]?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  M1  is  right  after  the  full  page  of tables.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  Two  pages  beyond  page  10.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  That's the way  I drew it  before;  that'sright.  In  the  fourth  quarter we're  going to  be  3/4  of a percentagepoint  above  the  parallel  line  and  it  would  get  progressively  less.  Idon't  know what  it  would be  in the  first  quarter;  I suppose  5/8ths  ofa percentage  point  or  so.2/12-13/85-62-

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Well,  it'll  be more  comfortable throughout  theyear  as  far  as  how  high up  we  can  go.  As  far  as  the  rate  of  growth wecan  have,  once we  reach  it,  it'll be  less.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  It  won't  be more  comfortable  in  the  fourthquarter.

[SECTION]

MR.  WALLICH.  There  is  more  room to  go  up.  There  isn't  moreroom  once  you're  at  the top.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  You  can  always  turn  the  picture  sideways,though, Henry!

[SECTION]

MR.  BLACK.  Or upside  down!

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  But  only  if you have  a  semi-log  scale.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You  come  out  the  same  place  in  the fourthquarter.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Mr.  Chairman,  I think Governor Wallich  issaying that  if you  reach  the top  of the  parallel  line you have  to  grow5-1/2  percent,  no  more  than that;  if  you  reach the  top  of  the  higherline  you have  to  grow 4-1/4  percent  or  something.  These  are  roughnumbers.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  That  is  correct.  It's  4-3/4  percent--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Say  we've had  a couple  of  quarters  of  9 percentgrowth;  the  arithmetic  implication is  that  it  is  going  to  have  to  dropto  5 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I think  all  these  implications  are  thesame.  Wherever you  are  in  the  first  quarter,  to  meet  the target  atthe  end  of the  year  growth has  to  slow down.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  Unless we  rebase.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Now, there might  lie  the basis  for  somecompromise.  We  can go  with the  4 to  7 percent  on  the understandingthat  we're  going  to  increase  it  later.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think clearly  [unintelligible].

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I don't  recall  that  we  ever have,  but  I may bewrong  about  that.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes,  we  did.

[SECTION]

MR. MORRIS.  We  did.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Oh yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  We  rebased, but  did we  ever  raise  it?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Yes,  we  did  both.

[SECTION]

MR.  MORRIS.  We  eliminated  it  for  one year.2/12-13/85-63-

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  In  mid-1983  we--

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  We  rebased  and  raised  [the  M1

MR. GRAMLEY.  We  rebased  and  raised the  target  from 5 to  9range].percent.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  We  rebased  on  the second  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  And  accepted the  overrun  in  the  first  half.

[SECTION]

MS.  HORN.  We  rebased  and we  respecified.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  We  made  a tremendous  change  in mid-1983.

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  The  base  became  the  second  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  And then  we  used  it  as  a monitoring--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  That's  right,  we  did;  rebasing made  a bigdifference.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I think we  always  reserve  this  right  andwe  have  done  it.  Suppose  it  ended  up  that  business  is  sluggish,inflation is  doing  fine,  and  the  dollar  is  very strong,  but  liquiditypreferences  are  high  and  money growth  is  running  high.  We  said moneygrowth  is  expected  to  run  high  in  the  first  quarter  of the  year;  if  atthe middle  of  the year  we  say we  don't  think  it's  reasonable  for  it  togo  down,  we  have  to  raise  the  target.  What  I would  hope would  happenis  that  inflation will  be  less,  we  will  get  nice  orderly  growth,  thatthis  trend  appears  in  M1--which  it  may  or  may  not--and that  everythingworks  out  just  copacetic.  Who  knows?  How much do  you think theconsumer price  index is  going  to  be  affected  by this  orange  andvegetable  situation?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  I think  we  have  4-3/4  to  5 percent  for  foodprices  in the  first  quarter.  Our  CPI  projection,  let's  see--

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  While the  staff  is  looking that  up,I would  just  note  that  one  of  the  things  that  could  really help  theprice  outlook  is  some  relaxation  in  these  Japanese  automobiles  quotasbecause  one  of the troubling  things  about  prices  even now  is  the waythe  auto manufacturers  are  sneaking in  all  these  price  increases.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Just  as  a matter  of curiosity, the  samething occurred  to  me--

[SECTION]

MR.  KICHLINE.  We  are  expecting a CPI  of  3-1/2  to  4 percentin  the  first  quarter.  Offsetting the  food  price  rise  is  an  expectedprice  decline  in energy  of  4 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How much  of  a bulge  do  you  have  in  thefood  prices?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  How much  of  a rise  in  food?  Food  prices  rose2-3/4  percent  in the  fourth  quarter  and  we  have them up  to  4-3/4percent,  so  that's  a 2 percentage  point  increase.  Energy  prices  were2/12-13/85-64-about  flat--up  a percent--and we  have  them down  4 percent,  so  theyought  to  be  offsetting  factors  in  the  first  quarter.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Are  Japanese  cars  in  the  consumer  priceindex?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  Conceptually,  yes.  They  expanded  the modelssome  years  ago  and  I used  to  know that  and  I don't  remember.  But  yes,conceptually.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  I wouldn't  look  for much  price  relief  fromraising  the  quotas.  The  quota  increase  probably  will  be  quite  small.And  the  excess  demand  for  Japanese  cars  is  so  great  that  I think  atexisting  prices  they  could  just  ship  a  few more  and  that's  about  it.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  That's  probably true.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I suspect  that's  right.  But  suppose  theytake  the  quota  off?

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Well,  my  sense  is  that  the  Japanese would  be  soreluctant  to  risk the  possibility  of  a  reimposition of  quotas  thatthey  would  increase  their  shipments  to  the United  States  in  quitemodest  amounts.  I would  doubt  seriously,  if we  had  a removal  of thequotas,  that  we would  see  an  increase  in  Japanese  shipments  of morethan,  say,  10  percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  But  don't  forget  that  the  South  Koreans  are  nowcoming  onto  the market.  [Unintelligible]  and  some  of these  othercompanies  are  coming  on  strong.  And  the  [cars  are  priced]  at  $6,000and under.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Yes,  I know.  I was  just--

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Favorable  prices.

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  --making  the comment  solely  with  respect  toJapanese  quotas.  The  shipments  from  South Korea  and  so  on  are  goingto  increase  anyway.  But  the  shipments  from Japan  I don't  think aregoing to  increase  very much.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  How  big a car  do  they  put  in the  consumerprice  index?

[SECTION]

MR. KICHLINE.  I have  somebody  on the  staff who  could  giveyou the  [specifics]  in  all  sorts  of ways,  but  I'm not  the  person.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You're  not  the man.  But  they don't  pricethe  expensive  ones,  do  they?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Not  the  really  [expensive  ones].

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't know what  they  call  expensive.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Cadillacs.2/12-13/85-65-

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  I think we  could  guarantee  that whatthey  would  call  expensive  would be  different  from what  you'd  callexpensive.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Actually, you'll  find  that  any car  is  expensive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I'm afraid  so.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  $10,000  or  more.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  I don't  hear  any bright  ideas  abouthow to  draw  these parallel  lines.  If  I don't  hear  any  stronger  ideasright  now,  I will  reserve that  prerogative unto  myself with theunderstanding that  there's  going  to  be  some  kind  of  parallel  linepicture.  But  I will  go  back  and  ask  two  questions.  Are those  whowant  higher  ranges  at  all  consoled by  making M2  and  M3  higher?  Andare  those who  don't  want  higher  numbers  distressed  by making M2  and M3higher?

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  It  depends  on  whether  we  can  agree  with  regardto  language.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  let's  look at  the  language.  Stevehas  given  me  a modified  sentence.  I don't  know whether  you'll  likeit:  "The  Committee  agreed that  growth in"--

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  They  ignore  the  separate--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  It  continues  the  first  page.  Change  the"M1"  to  "monetary aggregates"  and  otherwise  the  first  part  remains  thesame:  "The  Committee  agreed that  growth  of the monetary  aggregates  inthe  upper part  of  their  ranges  for  1985  may  be appropriate,  providedthat  inflationary  pressures  remain  subdued  and  depending  on  velocitytrends."  If  we use  that  kind  of  language,  it  just  reads  a  little moresmoothly  to  me  to  say  "may be  appropriate depending  on  velocity trendsand  provided  that..."

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  It's  important  to  make  that  comment  with  regardto  velocity.  That's  been a  good  deal  of the  substance  of  ourdiscussion.  And  John  Balles  has  been  [suggesting]  language withregard  to  the  lagged  effects  of the  interest  rate  drop  in the  lastyear.  Whether  that's  appropriate--.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I think  that's  broadly  encompassedin  this  term "velocity trends."  It  may  not  be  a trend,  but  in thiscontext  we're  not  really talking  about  it  depending  on  long-termvelocity trends;  what  we  mean  is  depending  upon  velocity this  year.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  We're  talking  about  short-termvelocity  rather  than  long-term.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  One  could  say  "depending on  velocitydevelopments."

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  "Developments" is  a better  word.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  And  if we  generalize  it  to  say  "monetaryaggregates"  that may  be  appropriate.2/12-13/85-66-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  It  picks  up M2.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  "Depending on developments  with  respect tovelocity and  provided  that  inflationary pressures  remain subdued."How do  you  like  that  language?

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  Poetry.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Sorry, Mr.  Chairman,  but  are  there  some words  inthat--we  don't  have  it  in  front  of  us--that  say  something  about  beingabove  the  cone  or  whatever?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  I wouldn't  say  that  in  thedirective.  But  it  would  be  said;  it's  implicit  in the  decision wehave  just  made.  We're  talking  about  a fourth-quarter target  here  andit  sounds  a little  awkward--I  don't  object to  it,  but it  seems  to metotally  unnecessary--to  say here  that  consistent  with that  fourth-quarter  target  we  intend  to be  above  the  cone  in  the  first  quarter.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  Oh,  I see  now.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I think that  point  should  be made;  I justdon't  see  that  it's  necessary  here.  I have  no  objections to  saying ithere,  but  it  just  seems  rather  complicated to me.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  You wouldn't be  prepared to  say monetaryaggregates  in the  upper part  of  their  ranges  or  above?  Well, thereare  two  great  provisos.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  No,  but  I think  I could  say  somethingabout  that  in the testimony.  I don't  think we  should  set  a range  andsay  we might  be  above  it.  We  might.  We  haven't  been within theranges  all  that  consistently, but  it's  rather  peculiar to  say  that  inthe  directive.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  That's why  7-1/2--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I have  no  problem with  saying:  "Obviously,we'll  look  at  these  at  midyear;  we  expect  to  be  above  in the  firsthalf  of the  year  and  if  velocity were  really  slow we'd have  to  look atthis  range  again  at  midyear."  I think we  probably ought  to  say that.What  about  M2  and  M3?  Let  me  examine the  proposition this  way.  I amassuming this  language  and--.  Where  are we  on  these  three  ranges?  Ifound myself testifying the other  day unable to  remember  what  theranges  were.  At  least  psychologically that  tells  you something.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Page  5.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  What's  the preference  for  [upper  limitsof]:  (a) 7, 8-1/2,  and  9 percent,  which is  exactly the  same  asalternative  II,  as  opposed to  (b) 7, 9, and  9-1/2  percent?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Opposed.

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Or  whatever it--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Well,  I didn't  get  around to  asking the

MR. MARTIN.  Oh,  I thought  you  said--

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  You  got  a little  overanxious  overquestion!there!

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  No,  we're  just  quicker!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  I'm  going  to  ask both.  Option  (a) isalternative  II  as  shown  [in  the Bluebook];  (b) is  1/2  percentage  pointhigher  for M2  and M3.  How many  prefer  (a)?

[SECTION]

MR.  GRAMLEY.  What  are you  talking  about  now?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Option  (a) is  alternative  II.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Yes.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  As  is.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  As  is.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  All  of this  has  the  language  in thedirective.

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  There is  only  one  hand  up,  Mr.  Boykin's.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Now,  (b) with a  1/2  percentage  pointhigher  on  the upper  end  of M2  and M3.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  Well,  I'm not  [for]  M2.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  I could live with  your  (b).

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  the  in-between  course  is  raising  M3.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I think  M2  is  likely to  give  us  trouble  and  Iwould want  that  upper  end  up  a little.  I don't  care  what  we  do  to  M3because  we  don't  pay any  attention  to  it.

[SECTION]

MR. RICE.  No;  that's  why  it's  harmless--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I don't  think that's  100  percent  true.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  99  percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  So,  we  use 7,  9,  and  9-1/2  percent  [asupper limits]  and  9 to  12  percent  [for  credit],  I guess.  Does  thathave the  largest  amount  of  support?  It  does  raise  a  question  in mymind:  If we  raise  those M2  and  M3  limits,  maybe  we  should  go  back tojust  talking  about  M1  in  that  sentence we  just  wrote.

[SECTION]

MR. MARTIN.  We might  still  have  a problem with M2.2/12-13/85-68-

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Yes,  we  could but  it--

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Why  don't  you  see  who  could  acceptyour  (b) but not  necessarily  prefer  it.

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  Yes,  who  can  live  with it?

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Our  point  estimate  of  M2,  which  may  be  a littlelow, would  only  be  a half point  above  the midpoint  of that  6 to  9percent.  It  could  well  be  8-1/4  percent  or  higher.

[SECTION]

MR. GUFFEY.  But  it's  still  well  within  the  range.

[SECTION]

MR. AXILROD.  Yes.  As  I say,  it's  only  a half  point  abovethe midpoint.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Well,  your  point  estimate  is  already  in  theupper part  of  the  range.  That's  another  way  of  putting  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  Well,  yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Your  point  estimate  is  what?

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  8 percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  AXILROD.  8 percent  at  the  moment.  That  requires  quite  aslowdown  in  the  subsequent  quarters.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.  Keep  in mind  that  that  moment  is11:50  a.m.  By  12:00  noon  it  may  be  something  else!

[SECTION]

MR.  MARTIN.  10  percent!

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  We  count  [deposits  at]  nonbank banks  in  themonetary  aggregates,  don't  we?

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  Those  that  have  checking.

MR.  BLACK.  Chuck,  only  those that  take  demand  deposits.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  What?

[SECTION]

MR. BLACK.  Ones  that  aren't  supposed  to  take  deposits--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  This  actually makes  M2  and M3  higher  thanwe  had  them last  year.  What  were  [the  ranges  for]  last  year?  I don'tguess  there's  any--

[SECTION]

MR.  STERNLIGHT.  Both were  6 to  9 percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  6 to  9 percent  for  both  of  them?  So  wecan make M2  the  same  and M3  a little  higher.

MS.  SEGER.  Just  to  educate  me,  if we  go  with the  4 to  7percent  for  M1,  can you  tell me  why we  can't  tie  it  to  the  midpoint  ofthe  fourth  quarter--that  is,  the  range  for  last  year  that  we  shot  for?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  we  can,  but  we  decided  not  to.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  It's  just  that  it  produces  so  much  rigidity  tohave  that  as  a precedent  for  doing it  in  the  future.  It's  like  havinga monetary  rule.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  Making that  up  was  one  of  the  reasons  why  Iwanted  to  have  a wider  band.  So,  I can  go  with the  narrower band  ifit's  calculated  from a higher  level.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Well,  that  is  the  reason  in my mind  forindicating that  we might  be  happy  in  the  upper  part  of the  range,based upon  what  we  know now.  All  right.  Do  you  know what  you'revoting  on?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Not  now.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  I think  so.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  7,  9,  and  9-1/2  percent  upper limits  [forM1,  M2,  and  M3,  respectively],  9 to  12  percent  [for  credit],  and  thesentence  as  we talked  about  it  in  the  directive.  There's  nothing  elsein the  language  that  raises  a  question is  there?

[SECTION]

MR. BALLES.  And with  a Volckergram.

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLEY.  He's  liable.  We  have  already  given him  theauthority to  make his  pictures  anyway he  wants to  including colors,dots--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  On the  understanding  that  there will  besomething  like  a parallel  line  on  the  [unintelligible].

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  Your  reference  is  to  all  the  aggregates  and  notjust  M1  in  this  sentence?

[SECTION]

MR. PARTEE.  I think  it  ought  to  say  aggregates;  it  ought  tobe  generalized.  If  they  don't  happen  to  be  there--well, they won't  bethere.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  Could  you  put  in  that  "reluctantly"?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN  CORRIGAN.  Somewhat  reluctantly?

[SECTION]

MR. WALLICH.  Limitedly.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.Governor Rice Governor  Seger Governor Wallich YesYesNo

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  VOLCKER.  All  right.  I guess  we  have  nothing  elseto  do.  The  Secretary  points  out  to  me  that we  had  better  modify thatsentence  about  retail  sales  registering  a large  increase  in  Novemberand  remaining at  a higher  level  in December  since  it's  no  longer  true.The  language  he  suggests  is:  "Total retail  sales  rose  moderately in[unintelligible].

[SECTION]

MR.  PARTEE.  [Unintelligible.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  You have  a chance  to  go  back  and  redo  your[Humphrey-Hawkins]  projections  if you  do  that within  a day  or  two.  Iwon't  register  my  concern about  the  price numbers,  except  that  I'mreminding you that  I registered  it.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  Are we  supposed  to  make  a  certain  assumptionabout  the value  of  the  dollar  to  be  consistent?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Yes,  I think the assumption would  bestated  as:  the value  of the  dollar  will  not  be  substantially changed.I think  what  we  said  last  time was  that  its  value  would  not  be  outsidethe  range-of trading in  recent months  or  something  like  that.  Wecould have  an  8 percent  decline  and  not  be  outside  that  range.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  The  assumption  for  the money  growth  is  at  themidpoint  or--?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  I really don't  know.  The  assumption  formoney at  wherever  you want  to  make it  within  that  range,  I guess.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  It  makes  quite  a difference.

[SECTION]

MS.  SEGER.  The staff  have  [M1]  at  6-1/2  percent  in  theirassumptions.

[SECTION]

MR.  GUFFEY.  Well,  that's  the point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  We  can proceed to  other things  [andadjourn  now].
