CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning,  everyone.  This  is  TomDavis's  last  meeting.  He  has been  coming  to  these meetings  for  20years,  and  I suspect  that  by now he  knows what  they  are  all  about,  andjust  as  he  finally  gets  it,  he  has  to  leave.  I think he has made  anextraordinary niche  in  the System,  and  if  there  is  ever  a plaque  inJackson Hole,  his name will  be  on  it.  One  thing that  you  can  sayabout  the Jackson  Hole  symposium, which  of  course Tom  struggledmightily to  help bring  into  existence,  is  that we  all put  thesymposium  on  our calendar  each year and  then adjust  everything else.Tom, we certainly  are  going  to  miss you.  [Applause]

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I hope  this  does not  mean the  end of  the  JacksonHole  conferences.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If  it  means  the  end of  Jackson  Hole,  Tomis  coming  back no matter where  he  is!  [Laughter]Shall  we  start  off?  Would somebody like  to  move  approval  ofthe minutes  for  the meeting of  November  13?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  So  moved.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman,  I have  a minor  suggestion  on oneof  the  changes  from  the preliminary draft  of  the minutes  that wereceived  just  last night.  It's  in paragraph 13,  and I talked  to  MikePrell  about  this.  I think  that  the  suggested rewording gives  theimpression  that  inflation is  projected to  come down  in  a meaningfulway, but when we  allow for  the methodological  changes  that  the  BLS  isputting  into  effect,  the  changed wording may give  a somewhatmisleading  impression.  This  is  probably a  technical  matter  that  wecould work out  after  the meeting  if  the  Committee  is  willing to  giveus  that  privilege.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don't  you  do  that.  The problem hereis  that  minutes  are  supposed to  interpret what  the  FOMC  members  said,even  when they  are  wrong.  So,  you  can't  argue  that  the minutes  arewrong when they  record what was  said;  you can only argue  that  they  arewrong when the  Secretariat  inappropriately summarized what  individualmembers  said.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Mr.  Chairman,  in this  case  the  reference  is  tothe  staff  forecast,  and  the question  is  how to portray  the movement  ofinflation  in 1996,  1997,  and 1998  and its  relationship  to--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Does  the  statement refer  to what  yousaid  or  to  what  one  of  your colleagues  said?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  In  essence,  it  refers  to  the Greenbook  forecast.We  could go back to  the  original wording  in  the  preliminary draft  ofthe  minutes or we  could put  in  something  that  says  the price  forecastis  adjusted for  technical  changes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I presume, as  President Moskow says,that  this  is  a solvable problem and not  something  that we  have  to12/17/96discuss  here  at  length.  Let  us  get  it  done.  Without objection, wewill  give you all  of  our  proxies.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

MR. FISHER.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mentioned that  the  dollar  is  holdingup  remarkably well  considering the  degree  of  downward pressure  ondollar-denominated asset markets.  A  while  ago,  we  discussed whetherin  fact  one  could ferret  out  the  apparent  intermediate-  to  longer-termeffect  on  the dollar  from  rising dollar interest  rates,  thepresumption being that  as  U.S.  interest  rates  rise, other  thingsequal,  the dollar will  rise.  The  experience you are noting and  theexperience  that  we have discussed  previously is  that  in periods  ofsignificant  worldwide  sales  of  dollar-denominated assets  and risingU.S.  interest rates,  our  exchange  rate  falls  or  tends  to.  Wepresumably were going  to  be  looking  at  whether there  is  any systematicanalysis  we can do  to  differentiate  those  contradictory phenomena.Have you made any progress  on  that?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Members  of  Ted's  staff  and my  staff  have beenworking  on  this,  and  I am afraid  there is  nothing  that we  can  comeforward with  that  is  conclusive  or very satisfactory.  Staff  arearguing back and  forth,  and  I do  not  think there  is  anything  that  wecan put  our  fingers on  that  provides  a systematic  explanation.  Thework is  going along.  I think what  is most  on market  participants'minds  is  the  abrupt  decline  that  the  dollar  suffered in  July when  ourequity markets  experienced  a reversal.  The dollar-mark lost  3pfennigs  very rapidly and  the  dollar-yen  also  came under  pressure.  Iam very  cognizant of  the  fact  that  markets  are  driven  to  a greatextent by habit.  They look  at  the most  recent  episode  to  see  whatother things might  happen and  to  give  them a  clue  as  to  how theyshould behave.  In July, we had pressure  in equity markets,  and  ittranslated immediately  into  a weakening dollar.  Many people  wereexpecting  that  to  happen  again as  they  looked  for pressures  in  ourasset markets.  So,  I am  just  reflecting on market participants'observations  that  that  did not  happen when  they expected  it  to.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The presumption, of  course,  is  that  if  asignificant  part of  dollar  asset  sales  occurs  on  foreign  accounts andthe  proceeds  are exchanged  into  other currencies  that  would explainthe  decline  in  the  dollar.  Obviously,  sales  of  dollar-denominatedassets  in which there  is  no exchange  into  foreign  currencies  bydefinition do  not have  that  effect.  In  this  regard, I  take  it  thatyou do  not have  any information  on  sales  of dollar-denominatedsecurities  or  purchases  by foreign accounts  that  is  usable  on  asufficiently short-term basis.  You  only have  it  on a quarterly basis,not  a monthly basis.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  that  is  right.  The  lags  are  a bit  long  inthat  regard.  I would also  note  that  in  addition to the mechanism thatyou  are  referring  to,  there  is  another mechanism.  If  risk appetitesare  large  at  the  end  of  the  cycle and  these happen  to  be  expressed  inlong dollar positions,  people might  collapse  dollar positions  in  aperiod where  risk aversion comes  to  the  fore  because of  uncertainty12/17/96and might  do  so  independently  of  whether they actually are  liquidatingdollar assets.  That  is,  there may not be  a direct  pass-through  fromthe  closing of  a stock position  to  the  sale of  dollars.  There mayalso  be some  management  of  foreign  exchange  market  exposures  thatsimply  implies  just  a  reduction  in risks  and  a reduction  in positions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You  talk  like  an  economist!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I have  been  exposed to  them  for  a while!

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Peter,  I have  a  couple of  questions  on yourplanned changes  for Desk Operations.  As  I understand  this,  you  haveoperations  for  customer  accounts  and you have  operations  for  Systemaccount.  Is  my understanding correct  that  on  System  operations youare  now going  to  announce  the  amount  after the  bids  have beenaccepted?  You  already announce the  size  of  customer transactions,  buton  that  side do  I understand correctly  that  you  announce  the  amount  ofbids  that you  are looking  for  and not  the amount  accepted?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.  That  is  the  historic  practice we  havecontinued.  Now, I may have gone  too  far  in explaining  this,  but  Ithink  that  in  all  likelihood customer  operations  may die  on  the  vine.I do not want  to  announce  that we will  never  do  another customeroperation, but  I am hard pressed  to  see  circumstances when  I would betempted  to  do  it.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  My question does  not  focus  primarily on  thecustomer  side.  Are  there  any advantages  or  disadvantages  when you  aredoing  System  operations  to  announcing the  amount  of  bids  that  you  arelooking  for?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  I think there  are  some  pros and  cons  toannouncing  the  quantity in  advance.  The pro  is  that  telling  thebe  helpful.  The con is  that  we  like  to  look at  dealer  appetites asone  indicator of  funding needs,  so  I am rather  uncomfortable  insituations  where we  announce  we  are  doing a  $1 billion customeroperation  and we  get  so  many bids  that  we  do  $2 billion, which  israther  typical.  I am not  saying  that  the  amount  of  the bids  is  alwaysdouble, but  that  is  rather  common.  The amount  of  dealer bids  forfinancing  is  actually a very helpful  piece  of  information  in  assessingthe  amount  of  reserves we  think we may need to  inject.  As  we havefocused  increasingly on  day-to-day operations  because  of  the muchreduced  operating balances  and related uncertainty, the  size  of  dealerbids  has  become a variable  of growing  importance.  I accept  inprinciple  that  it  would be  better  to  announce  the  size of  intendedSystem  operations, but  that  makes me  somewhat uncomfortable because  Ilike  to  see  the  dealers' appetite  as  an  indicator  that  may lead me toshade  the  size  of  the  operation one  way or another.  In my view,announcing the  size  of  the  contemplated operation becomes problematic.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  That  seems  like  a reasonable tradeoff.  If  youare planning  to  go  in  earlier,  and I presume  this  is  just  a waystation  to  entering  the market  still  earlier  as more  informationbecomes available,  that  opens  up the possibility, or maybe  thelikelihood,  that  you can come  into  the  market more  than  once  duringthe  day.12/17/96

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  As  I explained in  the memo.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  Yes.  What  are  the  kinds  of  things  that you lookfor--you have talked about  this  some, but  could you elaborate--inreserves;  do  you  look at  the  funds  rate;  do you  look at  both;  or  doyou in  a sense put your hands  over  the market  to  get  its  feel?  Whathappens?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  it  has  been a while since  the  Desk had anykind of  habit  of  going  into  the market  multiple times  a day--I guesstwenty years or  so.  I certainly have no  hands-on experience with suchmultiple  daily operations.  Among the  things we would look for  wouldbe an unexpected shift  in  the Treasury balance that  could be a bigfactor  that we would become aware  of  later  in  the  day.  The drain  ofreserves  from a rise  in  the  Treasury balance  is  information  that  isavailable  to  us,  as  would be  an unexpected  shift  of  funds  and drainstemming  from our customer  operations.  These are  the  first order  offlows  about which we would become  aware with  some  degree of  certainty.Another  reserve  factor about which we are  certain  relates  to  thoseoccasions, which I am hoping  avoid, where we do  not  get  to  add as  muchin reserves  as  we wanted to.  Then,  it would be  nice,  if  we did notshock  the market  in  the process, to  be  able  to  come back and conductfurther  operations because  we did not get  enough bids  the  first  time.That  is  another sort  of  fact,  certainly.The harder  issues  are  those where the  funds  rate  just  staysfirm and,  in  the  current environment  where we  operate  once a day, weare  left  to  wonder  in  the  early afternoon whether we made  a mistake.We talk  to  brokers  and funding  desks  to  find out  where  something  isgoing wrong;  sometimes  we  can  determine  the reason,  such  as  fundsgetting  trapped in  a bank  that  is  having wire  transfer problems.  Thebank may  continue to  have  a wire  transfer problem throughout  the  day,and adding a little  reserves  could be  helpful  in  that  situation.  Ithink that  is  the  sort  of  issue  that we  have  to  look  at.  Don Kohn andI have  talked about  this  at  some  length over  the  last  couple  of years.What we  are really  rather hopeful  for, but  is  still  even  further off,is  some way to be  able  to  operate  truly late  in  the  day,  that  is,  at3:00 p.m. or  4:00  p.m.--which would require  a change  in Fedwire  rulesand perhaps the  window--or even later  at  6:00  p.m. would have more  information  then about  a number of  factors and wouldknow whether  there  is  a reserve miss  or not  and could try  to  respondto  it.We  certainly

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We  would have  a better sense  of  the  demand  forreserves  late  in  the day.  I think  that  one of  the phenomena  of  thislow reserve  balance situation,  at  least  a couple  of  years  ago, wasthat  things  could  shift  rather dramatically in  terms  of  demands  forexcess  reserves very late  in  the  day.  I think many other  centralbanks  operate more  than once  a day, and particularly  if  there  is  aninterest rate  target,  it  would be nice  to  have  that  flexibility.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  So,  in  terms  of  the new framework  for conductingoperations,  I think multiple operations  on one day would be  usedinfrequently but  would be  available  to  us.  So,  whether we operated at9:30  a.m. or  at  10:30  a.m.,  we  would have the  option of  coming back at11:30  a.m. if  we became aware  of  something very  tangible about  theTreasury balance or  other developments unexpectedly affecting12/17/96reserves.  But  I am also  trying to  set  the dealers  up  for  the  timesome  months  or  years hence where  we  might  try  to  create  a window  forthe  Desk  late  in  the  day if  the  combination of  low operating  balancesand volatility  late  in the  day really becomes  an  issue.  We  do  notknow that  that will  happen, but  in  case  it  does,  I want  to  alert  themto  that  possibility.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  In  that  vein and before  multiple  interventionson the  same  day become commonplace,  I think  it  would be helpful  to  theCommittee  to  see  some  analysis  of  that.  I have not  thought  about  it  alot,  but  one  of  the  things  that  worries me  a little  is  the  presumptionamong market  participants that  we  are  going  to be  there,  and  thatcreates  a disincentive  for  them  to maintain  proper operating balances.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I would like  to  echo  that  concern.  I agree withyou and  I would want  the Committee  to  have  that  discussion.  I also  amquite worried that  if  we jump  too quickly into multiple dailyoperations, we will  actually reduce  the  incentive  for  intermediationin  the  fed  funds market.  Clearly, these  incentives have beentaken hold,  there  has been  less  juice  in  the  system  for an  individualbank desk  or  treasurer to  intermediate  in  the market,  so  theirincentives  to  do  so  have been  coming  down.  We  have  to  be  careful  notto  reduce  those  incentives  further by our behavior.  That  meansintervening only when we  think  the market really  is  not working, whensomething  looks  as  if  it  is  broken.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Overall,  I think what  you  are doing  isresponsive  to  developments  in  the marketplace,  and  I applaud  the  stepsyou  are  taking.  So,  I am supportive  of  that.  One  other  suggestion  Iwould make,  Peter,  is  that  when you talk  to  the dealers  about movingto  an  earlier  time  for Desk operations, you might  want  to  telegraphthat when  our statistical  system will  support  it,  you are  going  towant  to  go  to  a still  earlier  time.  That will  give  them  an  idea  ofwhere you ultimately want  to  get  in  terms  of  the  timing of  the  firstintervention  in the  day.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Peter, you  talked  about  the  expected performancegains.  Can you  say anything more  about  the magnitude  of  those  gainsby going  in  earlier?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  In  terms  of  bids?

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Do  you have  any quantitative  sense  about that?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Well,  in  the  last  couple  of  weeks,  as  you willhave  observed, we have  operated a number  of  times at  10:30  a.m.,  inpart  responding  to  firm conditions  in  the  funds  market  and the  largeneed that  I was worried that  we  might not  have  enough bids  to  cover.I should have  this  statistic  on  the  tip  of  my  tongue, but  I don't--Ithink we  almost routinely  saw something  like  a  doubling  in the  amountof  propositions  from  the dealers  when we have  operated  at  10:30  a.m.12/17/96rather  than  at  the normal  time  of  11:30  a.m.  Now, whether  that  is  afunction  of  the  surprise value of  our being in  the market  and  theirknowing that we were  looking  to  fill  big needs,  I could not  sort  out.But,  clearly, we have  seen  a substantial  improvement  in  the  amount  ofpropositions by  going in  one  hour  earlier.

[SECTION]

MR. CHAIRMAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I also  applaud  these  moves  in  the  direction  ofgreater  transparency.  I think  these  are  the kinds  of  things we  shouldbe  doing.  But you also  are  taking  away one piece of  information,  forbetter  or worse,  stemming  from the  use  of  customer RPs.  The way  thatwas  used  in  the  past by  the Desk was  to  help estimate  the reserveneed.  So  that got me  to  wondering, why not  go a step  further?  Whatare  the  pros  and  cons  of  actually telling  the markets  what yourrolling projections of  the  reserve needs  for  the period are?  Is  theresome  reason why you think  that would  create adverse  incentives  on  thepart  of  the banks?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I have  thought quite  a bit  about the  pros  andcons  of  providing some  sense  of  our reserve  forecast.  Clearly in  onesense,  that  would provide  some modicum of  certainty, but  as  soon  as  Ihave  that  thought  I realize  that  it  does  not provide  a modicum ofcertainty.  Our  forecasts  are  really quite movable  feasts,  and I willstart  at  the  end of  my own analysis  of  it.  One  of  the  things  that  Ihave  come  to  realize  is  that  the  forecasters who  work for  Don and meare  actually most valuable  in  telling me what  the probabilitydistribution is  of  their  forecast  error.  That  is,  on  which side  dothey  think their errors  are  most  likely to  be?  That  actually is  themost useful bit  of  information  for me  in  the  whole exercise.  That  isbecause we  can then  think  through which way we  want  to  lean  on  thebasis  of  our  own utility function.  Now, that would be  impossible  tocommunicate to  the  market unless we  sort  of  did it  by shading  theforecast.That  leads me back to  the  start  of  my own analysis.  When  Ilook at  the whole  issue  of  transparency, whether  it  is  the  Committee'stransparency on  policy or  our  transparency in  operating  in  the market,I think those  are  two  things  about which we need to  be clear.  In mycase  the  objective  is  simple:  You have  told me  that the  target  rate  is5.25  percent.  It  is  in  our operations  where we have not  been astransparent.  The process  that  drives  our  decision-making  is  a littlefuzzier  and a little  harder  to  communicate,  particularly while we  aregoing  through a shift  in market behavior  associated with  low operatingbalances and  a heightened degree of  uncertainty.  If  I had muchgreater  confidence  in  the  accuracy of  our  forecasts  and  in  turn  in  therelevance  of  our  two-week  forecasts  to  the day-to-day volatility inthe market  than  I have  today,  I would be  leaning more on  the  side  ofreporting  our  forecasts.  But  given where I am now in my ownuncertainty about  the  relationship between  our two-week  forecasts andday-to-day demand  for  reserves,  I really am quite  squeamish  about  it.So,  I think there  are definitely pluses  and minuses, pros  and cons,but  it  is--

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I understand that  the  errors  in  the  dailyforecasts  stem principally from unexpected changes  in  the  Treasurybalance,  but  other  factors  such  as  float  get  in  the  way of accurateforecasts.  Of  course,  that kind of  uncertainty exists now  in  the  way12/17/96that what you  announce  to  customers  is  interpreted,  so I don't  seewhere  that  changes  anything.  All  of  the  analysts  on  the  outsideunderstand  that.  Most  of  them  worked at  the  Desk!  [Laughter]  Infact,  isn't  it  the  case  that  the  Bank of  England, which may intervenea number  of  times  in a day, puts out  a number  on  the  amount  they havein mind?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  they do,  and I  think that  raises  aninteresting question.  They have a one-day maintenance period.  If  theus  to  conclude  that  a  two-week maintenance  period was becomingirrelevant--it does  not  look  like  that  is  going  to  happen but we  areon that  trend even  though  there  is  no  certainty about  it--then  I thinkwe would  have  to  come  back and  think very hard about operating  on ade  facto  one-day maintenance  period basis.  We would have  to  decidehow much money the  banking system needs  each day.  The Bank of  Englandwith its  one-day maintenance period has  3 or 4 windows  every dayduring which  they may operate.  They announce what  their  forecastshortage will  be  for  the day,  decide whether to  provide  some money ornot,  and whether  to  enter  the market  immediately  or  later  in  the day.With  the  one-day horizon,  there  is  not much intermediation acrosstime,  which  is  something  I think we would want  to  encourage  our banksto  do.  If  we get  to  that point,  we will  have  to  rethink  quite anumber  of  things.  A  one-day horizon gives  rise  to  questions  of  whatthe  target  should be,  the  forecast  itself,  and whether,  given  theimplications  for  incentives  as  President Melzer pointed out,  we  shouldbe  operating multiple  times  a day  on an  ongoing basis.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I presume  that  that  would  take  away theintra-period gaming  that we  see  going on.  I agree completely with  TomMelzer on  the need  for  that  kind of  discussion,  and  I would suggestthat when we  have  it  that  we  include  consideration  of a more  flexibleuse of  the window.  I am not  against activity  later  in  the  day, but  Ialso  think that  we may need  to  rethink  the  role  of  the window in  anenvironment where we make adjustments  to  unexpected  reserve needs  latein  the day.  That applies  not  only to what we do  on  our  side  inmanaging  the window, but  also  to  how we  should  influence perceptionson  the other  side about  the  availability of  the window  foradjustments.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Absolutely.  Don Kohn and I had  the  benefit  ofbeing  on a conference  call  with  all  the discount  officers  from  theReserve Banks,  and we  gently urged  them  to  encourage  greaterflexibility in  thinking about  the  use of  the  discount  window.  I thinkthat  group  is  very helpfully working  on a number  of  issues,  includingthe  consistency of  collateral  management  across  different Districtsand the  implicit  messages  that  are  sent  to banks  about  the  use of  thediscount window.  Quite  frankly,  one  of  the  issues  that  we have now--and  I don't have  a sense  of  which Districts are  relevant--relates  tothe  fact  that,  as  discount  officers  have noted, major  banks  in  someDistricts  just  never want  to  come  to  the discount window.  Now, thattranslates very rapidly back  to  us  at  the  Desk with  regard todevelopments  in  the  fed funds market.  That  is  because  certainregional banks  are not  going to  the discount  window but  they arecoming  into  the  funds  market when they have a miss or  an unexpectedheightened demand  for  funds  late  in  the  day.  That  is  one  source ofpressure  in  the  funds  market.  So,  I agree  completely with  thedesirability of  discussing the  role  of  the  discount window.12/17/96

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Peter,  just  to  get  a  little better  handle onthe  magnitude of  the  benefits, do  you have any  sense as  to whether  thevariance per  day  around the  average  effective  fed funds  target  rate  isgreater  in  recent years?  Are you  having more  trouble  hitting yourtarget  in  some  sense?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We have not had more  trouble.  At  some point,  Iwould  like  to  bring  an  analysis  forward  to  the  Committee;  it  is  notfinished yet.  We have  begun using  internally a standard deviation  ofthe  prior day's  effective  federal  funds  rate  in volume-weighted  terms.We have  the  raw data that  are used  to  calculate  the  effective  rate,and we  currently look  each day at a  standard deviation of  that.  Therehas  been considerable volatility this  year,  concentrated roughlyspeaking in  the middle half  of  the  year as  I recall.  But  it  does notappear  to  be  anywhere near  the kind of  volatility that  we  experiencedin  1991.  Interestingly, even though  it  has  been high  for  the  year asa whole,  there  are  some  months  this  year  in  which it  has  been  lowerthan  in some  months  in  1994  or  1995.  So,  we  are nowhere near  a crisisin our ability  to  manage  the  fed funds  rate, but  volatility has  beenmoving up.  Some  of  the  fed funds watchers  have printed charts  thatshow volatility, but  they only cover  the  last  two  years.  From alonger  perspective, the  volatility this  year  is  still  well below  thatexperienced in both  1991  and  the  early  1980s.  One would  expect  thatfor  the  early 1980s,  of  course,  and  it  is  more relevant  to  look  at  thebroad  sweep.  So,  we are observing  developments,  and  I would like  tobring  that  analysis  forward to  the  Committee  at  some point.  Thepeople who work  for me wonder  whether we  shouldn't publish  the dailystandard deviation along with  the  effective  rate.  That  is  an  issue wewill  be  thinking about,  and we will  bring it  back  to  the  Committee.

MR.  KOHN.  Peter,  I now have  a table  in  front  of me thatshows  this.  The  standard deviation  of  the  daily  federal  funds  ratefrom  the FOMC's  targets  this  year is  a little  higher  than  in  1993,1994,  or  1995  and about  the  same as  in  1992.  So,  it  really has  beenin  about the  same  range  for  several years.  I think an  interestingaspect,  though,  is  that  the  intra-day variations  have been  a littlehigher this  year.  There has  been  a tendency,  as  Peter reportedbefore,  for  spikes  to  occur  late  in  the  day.  If  one  looks  at  thehighs  relative  to  the  average and  at  some of  those  types  of  volatilitymeasures,  they  are  a bit  higher.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Right.  That  applies  to  the  rates at  which  fundshave  traded without  taking  volume  into  account.  For  example,  it  doesnot  tell  us  how much trading  there  was  at  the  higher  rates during  theday.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  high-low range,  for example,  is  wider thisyear  than  it  has  been  for  a couple  of years.

MS.  MINEHAN.  I want to  add my approval;  I welcome  thechanges.  I think  they will  be helpful  to you  in getting a betterrange  of  bids.12/17/96-9-I did want  to  comment  a little  on your  thoughts  for makingour operations  more  transparent,  granted that  there  is  a  range ofuncertainty, particularly about  the projected need for  reserves  over  aperiod of  time.  We  have been  hearing from  some  of  the  fund managersin Boston  about  the  interpretation of  a  lack of  a coupon  pass  inforth.  The temporary nature  of  the  System's  operations at  a  time whennormally more permanent,  outright operations  were  expected wasinterpreted  as  a  subtle way of  keeping things  tighter than  theyotherwise would have  been.  Of  course,  there was  no way to  reply tothis,  knowing  that  the  information you  share with us  is  not  to  beshared with  other people.  But perhaps  some of  that  might  havedissipated a little  and maybe  it  would have had  some  effect  on  thestock market  volatility.  Of  course,  these  fund managers  were  in  thestock market  more  than  in  any  other market.  In any  event,  the  effecton market  expectations was very marginal.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I think  the  shift  in expected  interest  ratesthat  occurred  in  the  first week  of December can hardly be  attributedto  the  presence or  absence of  the Federal  Reserve  in  the  couponand whether or not we  bought  $4 billion  would hardly seem to  matter.It  is  true  that many people  talked about  the  absence  of  a  coupon pass,but how that  could have affected  the  March futures  contracts  haschallenged me a  little.  It  is  awkward--I  will be  blunt  about  this--that  the  last  remaining business  for  the  Fed watchers  is  predictingwhen we will  do  coupon passes.  That  is  what  the  franchise has beenreduced  to  since we  adopted the  current  practice  of  announcing policychanges.  So,  that  is  about  the  last  thing  that  the  people who  writethe weekly  reports  and  screens  have  to  offer  to  their  subscribers.  Toleave  that  thought with you, we  have  a certain  feedback problem.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  Yes,  I realize  that.  The more  transparent youget,  the  more everybody wants.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  He  is  creating unemployment!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Some  analysts  who write  these  screens  got  itright.  There was  one  who was  absolutely on  the money when heexplained  that  the Desk probably was  concerned about  having to  drainreserves  in  January.  That  is  exactly what  I told you,  and  I couldhave read his  analysis here  instead of  my own.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Mike, what  is  the  change  in  the Decemberindustrial production  index that  is  implicit  in your  fourth-quarteraverage?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  As  I recall,  it  is  up about  3/10  of  a percent.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  weekly data,  for what  they  areworth, are  suggesting that  it  is  flat  to  down.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  They account  for  a very small portion,  as  youknow, of  the  overall  index.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So,  I gather  they will  affect  thequarter by only  .1 or  .2 percent.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  You mean the  quarterly average?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  The  total  percentage  change  from  thethird to  the  fourth quarters  if  you are  only affecting  the  Decemberindex.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Exactly, it's  a very small  weight  in  the  outcomefor  the  quarter, but we have  been looking  at  the  other  evidence  suchas  trends  in orders,  and we are  comfortable  in anticipating  a moderateincrease.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mike,  I have  two  questions.  The  first  deals withthe  PCE in  the fourth  quarter.  Based upon the  data  that we have,which  of  course  include  the PCE  for October,  retail  sales  for  Octoberand November, and what we are  hearing about  retail  sales  for  theChristmas  season, do you  feel  that  this  is  consistent with a  PCEgrowth  rate  in  excess  of  3 percent  in  the  fourth quarter?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We  feel  comfortable with  that  at  this  point.  Weare anticipating that,  in part  because  of  the  effects  of  the  coldweather  that  showed up  in  the utilities  component of  IP  in November,the  energy  component  of  PCE services  would be quite robust  inChristmas  sales  activities, but  I will note  for what  it  is  worth--andit  may not be very much,  for even  though it  has  gained  someprominence,  it  is  a very small  sample--that  the Mitsubishi  chain  storereport  that  came  out  this  morning  showed a quite  sharp  furtherincrease  in  the  latest week.  So,  we have had a couple  of  weeks  ofdistinct upward movement  there.  We have  heard other  good things  aboutretail  sales.  So  we  are  reasonably  comfortable, especially giventhat--going back to  the  Chairman's  arithmetic point--a deviation of afew tenths  in  the  outcome  for  December will  have  only a modest  effecton annualized  growth rates.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  The  second  question relates  to  what  I heard yousay about  the  distribution around GDP  numbers  for  the  fourth quarter.Based  on  the  data you have  seen, particularly  the more  recent  data,would you, if  you were  to  give us  a new estimate,  revise  that  estimateas  well?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Not materially.12/17/96-11-

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  But probably  up?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  More  likely up than  down given,  for  example,  thestronger  industrial production  data.  Also,  the  single-family  housingstarts  will  feed through  rather directly  in  the  calculation  ofresidential  construction activity in  the  current  quarter  and add  asmidge.  So,  the  adjustment  might be  in an upward  direction butnothing of  great significance.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Who would like  to  start  the  roundtable?President  Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  I will  keep my comments briefbecause  economic  conditions  in  the  Kansas  City District have  notchanged a great  deal  since  the  last  time we met.  Our  regional  economyhas  continued to  grow consistently, although  at a moderate pace.  Onthe  anecdotal  side,  our  directors  and other  business  contacts  reportsolid economic  growth  throughout  our District.  Retail  sales  have beenrobust  during  the  first  two weeks  of  the  holiday season.Manufacturing remains  healthy.  Homebuilding has been  strong.  Of  themajor  sectors,  I think the  only moderately weak area has  beennonresidential  construction.  Estimated  employment, reinforcing  theseother reports,  actually  increased in October  after remaining  flat  formost  of  the year.  Our  farm and energy sectors  continue  to  improve.Our grain  sector reported  excellent  crops  and  is  doing quite well  atcurrent prices.  We  are  again  seeing  some of  that  translate  intopurchases  of  equipment  as  farmers  take  some  of  their  sales proceedsand reinvest  them.  Our cattle  industry  is  profitable  on  the  feedside,  although  ranchers  are  still  losing money.  In  our  energy sector,current  prices  have  encouraged small  but persistent  increases  indrilling activity.  Wholesale  and  consumer prices  appear  to be  risingslowly but  consistently throughout the  District.  Our  labor markets,as  I have said  before, continue  to be  tight,  and we  are  hearing morereports  of  wage pressures.On  the  national level,  I do not have  a lot  to  add  to what  Ihave  heard  from Mike  Prell  today.  We  are in  general  agreement  withhis  forecast.  I would note,  and again raise  some concerns  about,  thefact  that  both we  and  the  Board  staff  are projecting  rising  coreinflation, even allowing  for  the  technical  adjustments.  The higherinflation would be  even more  apparent  without  these  technicaladjustments.  That  concludes  my comments.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  relatively fast  economic  growthcontinued  in  the  Twelfth District  in  recent months, making  this  a verygood year  in  the  West.  Almost  1/3  of  the jobs  added across  the  50states  over the  last year have  been in  the  Twelfth District  states.As  a matter of  fact,  the percentage  growth  in  employment  in ourDistrict  states has  been twice  that  of  the  other  states.  In  terms  ofyear-over-year employment growth,  the  District's  inter-mountain statesof  Nevada, Utah, Arizona,  and Idaho have  been  the  four  fastest growingstates  in the  country.  The  12-month pace of  job  gains  in  the  inter-mountain West  exceeded  4-1/2  percent.  Although  employment growth hasslowed a bit  in  recent months,  it  has maintained a healthy pace.  The12/17/96Pacific  Northwest  is  the next  fastest growing  region  in  the  country.After  the  four  inter-mountain states,  Washington  and Oregon rank  fifthand  sixth in  terms  of  the  underlying pace  of  job  growth, which hasbeen  about 4 percent.  Employment  growth recently picked up  to  thisfast pace  in Washington  largely  owing  to  the  rebound at Boeing,although companies  such  as  Microsoft  are contributing as well.The  sizable  California economy  is  growing  faster  than  thenational pace,  with employment  in  the  state recently  growing at  a rateof  about  3 percent.  Not  all  sectors  have  shared  equally in  the  long-delayed California  recovery, but we  now see  a pickup  in some  of  thelagging  sectors.  The  state government  budget  situation  finally hasimproved  enough  to  allow the  hiring of  many needed public  schoolteachers,  and much additional  hiring  is  expected next year.  In theresidential  real  estate  sector,  sales,  prices,  and  new constructionwere weak  throughout  the  first half  of  the  '90s but began  to  increasein  1996  in  some areas  of  the  state.  As  a matter of  fact,  the  SiliconValley area  surrounding San  Jose is  actually booming.Turning  to  the  national  economy,  if  the  current  stance  ofpolicy were maintained, I would envision  the  economy  for  1997  as  awhole  growing at  its  trend rate  as  a result  of  several  roughlyoffsetting positive and negative  factors.  On  the positive  side,  itdoes  seem  that  exports  should be  boosted by  the healthy growth  of  ourtrading partners,  and  spending on  computers  and  related products mostlikely will  continue  to  grow rapidly.  On the  negative  side,  itappears  that  strong  increases  in  consumer spending on  real  assets  likehousing and durables  to  satisfy pent-up demands  has  largely run  itscourse.  Of  course,  fiscal policy will  continue  to  be  on  therestrictive  side.  With  the  economy  slowing  in  the  current  quarter andthen  advancing at  around its  trend rate  next  year, we have  scaled  backour estimate  of  the  level  of  resource  utilization  for  1997.  Ofcourse,  judging  resource utilization  is  particularly  difficult  rightnow,  especially in labor  markets.  My best  estimate  is  that  thereprobably will  still  be  a  slight degree  of  excess  demand  in  the  economynext  year,  which suggests  that  there will  be  only a very gradualupward  trend  in  underlying  inflation.  Our  forecast  shows  core CPIrising  from under  2-3/4  percent  this  year to  close  to  3 percent  in1998.  In  the  longer-term  context,  our model  simulations  suggest  thatit  actually would take  a slight  tightening of  the  stance  of  policynext year  to  make the  inflation rate  settle  in  at around  3 percent  infuture years.  However,  it  appears  unlikely that  a downward  tilt  toinflation, which  I think would be  desirable, would be  forthcomingunless policy were  tightened more substantially next year.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  overall  conditions  in  the SeventhDistrict  economy are little  changed since  our last  meeting.  Ourregional  economy continues to  operate  at  a high  level,  withunemployment rates  in  each  of  our five  states  still  below  the nationalaverage  and most  of  our key manufacturing  industries producing at  ornear  capacity.  Although  some  increase  in  compensation rates has  beenreported for  selected labor market  areas,  there does  not  appear  to  beany spillover  into prices.  The one major  change  in  the  Districteconomy  is  that  the  recent  evidence  shows  a definite slowing  inhousing activity  similar  to what was  reported for  the  nation  earlier.Purchasing Manager  surveys  from around  the  District  still  indicate12/17/96-13-healthy expansion  in the  manufacturing  sector.  The December ChicagoPurchasing Managers'  report, which will  not be  publicly availableuntil  the  end of  this  month, indicates  a  slight  slowing  from  thedeliveries component moved up by  .6 percent  to  49.9  percent  in50.7 percent  in November.Retailers  generally report  that  holiday  sales have beensomewhat  better  than  expected.  One  major national retailer  expressedconcern  that  their  recent  sales  have been  so  strong that  they  could beborrowing  sales  from  early  1997.  Some  weakness  has been  reported insales  of  appliances, but  that  may reflect  the  housing slowdown  morethan  the holidays.Turning  to  the  steel  industry,  concern was  raised at  our lastmeeting about  possible weakness  in  the  early part of  1997,  and we havemade  some  special  efforts  to  check with  our  contacts  in  the  SeventhDistrict.  They suggest  that  the demand  for  steel  remains  quitestrong.  Order books  are  full  through  the  first  quarter and  into  thesecond quarter  of  next year.  Mills  in  the Midwest  are  reported  to beoperating at  higher  levels  than  elsewhere  in  the  country, likelybecause  of  heavy orders  from the  automobile  industry, but  our  contactsalso report  strong  orders  from a broad  spectrum of  customers.  Theoutlook  for steel  prices  is  uncertain.  One  contact  expects  prices  torise early next year  as  a result  of  continued  firmness  in  demand butnot  enough  to  reach  the  early  1996 price  levels.  Another  indicatedthat  steel  prices would  remain  stable  because of  increasing  imports  aswell  as  additional mini-mill  capacity  coming  on  stream  in  1997  andinto  1998.In  the  automobile  industry, light  vehicle sales  came  in  at14.8  million units  in  both October  and November,  and early reportsindicate  that  sales  are  continuing at  about  the  same pace  in  December.We  expect sales  in 1997  to  decline  somewhat  from  the  15  million unitsof  this year,  given  the  slower economic  growth  expected next year,fewer price  incentives,  and a record  number of  cars  coming  off  leasein  1997.  On  the production side,  we  all  know  that  the production  of alarge number  of  new models  introduced by General Motors  has  beenconstrained by  strikes.  Our  latest  information  is  that  GM modelchangeovers now  are proceeding  somewhat better  than GM officials  hadanticipated, but  strike-related production  losses will  not becompletely recouped until  early next  year.  One problem in  making uplost  production is  the  availability of  parts  for  light  trucks.Several  suppliers  reported that  they will  be  working over  the holidaysto catch up  on orders,  which  is  unusual  for  these  suppliers.Turning to  the  national  economy,  the  outlook has  not  changedmuch since  our  last meeting.  Growth  in  the  economy has  deceleratedsubstantially since  the  first half  of  the  year,  and we  see  outputgrowing  at  or  slightly above potential  in  1997,  similar  to  theGreenbook forecast.  Earlier  this  month, we  hosted our  annual  economicoutlook  symposium for  business  contacts  and economists  from around  theDistrict.  The consensus  of  around 30  forecasts  submitted  for  thismeeting was  for  real  GDP  growth  of  about  2 percent  in  1997  and CPIinflation  running a  little under  3 percent  next  year.  My  own view ofthe  risks  to  our  forecast  is  that  they are  slightly tilted  to  the upside.  The Greenbook  forecast  for  core CPI  inflation  remains below 312/17/96percent but  only because  of  the  BLS methodological  improvements,  asTom  Hoenig mentioned.  At  previous meetings,  we have  talked a lotabout  the  value of  low inflation, and although we may have disagreedslightly over  the  timing  and  the  approach to  achieving pricestability,  I believe  that  there was  broad agreement  that we  should  atleast  cap  inflation at  current  levels.  The question  is,  what  arecurrent  levels?  This  is  reminiscent  of  our problem in  interpretingthe  change  to  a chain-weighted GDP methodology a year  ago when we allhad to  recalibrate  our assessment  of potential  output  growth.  Now, weneed to  stop  thinking about  targets  like  3 percent  for  core  inflation,if  we  are  to maintain  our progress  in reducing  the  core  inflationrate.  I think this  will  be an  issue  of  increasing  importance  nextyear.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mike,  our  reports  fromsomewhat  softer  than what you are  reporting.  They have  solid ordersthrough  January,  softening  in February, and there  is  no  indication offirming  into  the  second  quarter.  Did you  check with them as  well?

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  We did,  though  they  are not  located in  ourDistrict.  We  primarily contacted  firms  in  our District,  but  we made  aspecial  effort  to  contact and we did  not get  anysense  that  there was  any  slowdown.  But  I think we  only asked themabout  the  first  quarter,  if  I recall  correctly.  The  firms  that  Italked to personally were  talking  about  the whole year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Their  cold-rolled  sheet  demand  comingfrom  autos  is  pretty good, but  their pipe demand  is poor.  As  Irecall,  they had not yet  filled  their  first-quarter  order  books.  Themini-mills,  I suspect,  are  doing  a good deal better,  so  your  sample

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Well,  we  specifically checked because  thisquestion had  come up  at  the  last  meeting,  and the  word that  I got  fromthat  orders  for  oil-related and  tubular  steel  goodswere very  strong.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  true.  President  Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  The New England  economy  is  humming  along,though  there  is  some  bounciness  in  the data.  Unemployment  ratesremain  low;  job growth  is  solid  and on  trend from  an  historicalperspective.  Net  out-migration  of  the  labor  force  is  less  than  it  wasin  the  early  '90s.  Consumer confidence  is  better than  it was  a yearago.  Real  estate  markets  are  in  particularly good  shape,  especiallyin  Massachusetts, and both manufacturers  and  retailers  see  prospectsfor  a solid  Christmas  and a good beginning  of  1997.On  the  negative side,  while  anecdotal  reports  continue  tostress  the  inability of  individual  firms  to  raise prices  and  theaverage  rate  of  growth  of  wages  in New England  remains  slower  than forthe  country  as  a whole,  the  Boston  CPI  has  experienced a couple  ofmonths  of  increases  that  are  sharper  than  for  the nation,  largelybecause  of  medical,  shelter,  and  fuel  costs.  Moreover, anecdotesabout wage pressures  in selected occupations  and areas  have begun  toflourish  once  again.  A mutual  fund company,  for  example,  justinstituted an  across-the-board salary  increase of between  5 and  10percent  on  top of  a merit  increase of  5 percent because of  intense12/17/96demand  for  system  and  service  professionals and  sales  people.  A  high-tech manufacturer reported  that  the  lid  has  blown  on  salaries  ofengineers  and software  specialists  in  the  Boston area  where  suchprofessionals  command  salaries  over  $100,000.  Given our  inability  tohire  such people at  the Boston  Fed, I think  this  is  probably  accurate.Another high-tech  firm is  offering stock  options  and  starting pay 20%above a year ago  to  attract  new technical  talent.  Thus,  while  thissort  of  competition  has not  found its  way into  average wage numbers,we do  see  some pressure on  overall  costs  from other  than wagecomponents, and  it  may be  only a matter  of  time  before  general  wagelevels rebound as  well.As  we all  do,  I meet periodically with various  groups.  InBoston, we  focus  on  investment  professionals  in  the  mutual  fundindustry and  on a panel  of  academic  advisers.  A  couple  of  similartrends were  evident  in our meetings  this  time,  and  I thought  I wouldgive you  some perspective  on  that.  Several  of  the  market  types  andsome  of  our  directors  as well  reported extreme competition  for yieldamong  the mutual  funds--which  I suppose  is  not news  to  anyone--andliquidity  of  the mutual  funds,  particularly the  equity mutual  funds,and more generally  about  the higher  and higher degree  of  leverage  infinancial markets.  Our  contacts  are worried that  this  degree  ofleverage  could make  stock market  adjustments more painful  thanotherwise  and, in  contrast  to  1987,  they perceive  that  the  economy  isgrowing more slowly  now so  that  its  resilience  in  the  face  of  a marketdownturn might  be  less.There was  some discussion  of  what,  if  anything,  the  Fed coulddo aside  from  the  occasional  speech  to  let  the air  slowly  out  of  anasset price  bubble,  assuming one  exists.  There  seemed  to  be  generalagreement  that  raising margin  requirements,  while  not particularlyeffective  in  substance, might  send  a message  to  the markets.  Butthere  really was no  great  enthusiasm  for  an  increase.  There wasconcern  that  more  proactive actions,  such as  raising the  funds  rate,might  not be  a good  idea unless  one were  sure  that  there would be  anorderly regrouping  after the  market  adjustment.  One person on  theacademic panel  commented that  it  was probably unlikely  that  we had anyfirm sense  of,  or  control  over,  what  would happen after  a marketadjustment,  and that  playing with avalanches  was  always  risky.Finally,  the  academics  saw wage  inflation as  the  dominant  risk  on  thehorizon, but most  of  them  thought  preemptive policy was notappropriate  at  this  point.  One participant  referred to  the  lack  ofevidence  on  the relationship between unemployment  and prices  at  lowlevels  of  inflation  and noted that uncertainty made  it  difficult  formonetary policy  to  be  extremely  forward-looking.  There were also  somecomments  to  the effect  that  there  is  not  a sharp distinction betweenbeing reactive  and being  forward-looking.  A  central  bank  that  isnervously reactive may  be  as  close  to  forward-looking  as  it  can get.[Laughter]On  the national  scene, we have  no  serious  questions  about  theGreenbook  forecast.  We  think  the  staff may be  overly optimistic  aboutinflation and  that  the  elements  of  strong growth  that  are present--jobgrowth,  rising  real  wages,  good disposable  income,  buoyant  financialpressure next  year  than  expected.  However,  we  think  the  staff maycontinue  to  be  slightly  overly optimistic  about  foreign growth  as12/17/96-16-well,  and who knows  whether  the Grinch will  actually steal  Christmasor  even  if  that  would be  an  adverse  development,  given  the  level  ofconsumer debt.  In  sum, we  are pretty much  in  agreement with  theGreenbook  forecast.

PRESIDENT GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Reports  that  weget  from around  the Atlanta District  indicate  that  growth hasmoderated somewhat  since  the  summer,  and  the  slowdown seems  to  becontinuing  into  the  fourth  quarter.  The  signs  of  that  slowdown  aremost  apparent  in  residential  construction and homes  sales,  but  theyalso  show  up  in  consumer and  commercial  loan demand.  Manufacturingactivity remains  subdued,  but businesses  are optimistic about  thenear-term outlook.  We are  seeing  for  the  first  time  some  speculativeoffice building  in Atlanta  and  in  some  cities  in  Florida, but  suchbuilding  is  not  at  a  level  that  is  worrisome at  the moment.  Aparticularly robust  tourist  season  is  helping the  economy  throughoutFlorida and  in  Nashville, but  the gaming  industry, which has  become  abig business  in  the  South,  is  going  through  some  restructuring andsome  shakeout  and  is  doing particularly poorly  in  the city of NewOrleans.Job creation  in  our  District,  which we  have reported meetingafter meeting  as  stronger  than  the  national  average,  now lags behindthe  nation  as  a whole.  Labor markets  remain tight  in many areas.  Asis  the  case nationwide,  these  labor  shortages have yet  to  manifestthemselves  in  significant wage pressures.  Finally, retailers  in  theDistrict  report  that  they have gotten  off  to  a strong  holiday seasonin  November.  I am reluctant to  make  any predictions based on  thatlimited  information, but  they  are still  cautiously  optimistic  aboutthe month of  December.The  financial  crisis  in  the  city of  Miami  is  creating  quite astir, with  considerable negative publicity.  Our  reading  is  that  thesituation, while  serious,  does  not  involve  a large  amount  of  dollarssince  the  city  of  Miami  is  a  relatively small  and poor core  of  a muchlarger and healthier metropolitan Dade  County area.  Interestingly,one  of  our Atlanta Bank  directors  has been named by the  Governor  ofthe  State  of  Florida as  one of  the  five  oversight committee  members.At  the  national  level,  the  economy does  appear  to  be  showingsome  signs  of  slowing.  For me,  the major  uncertainties  continue  to bewhether  labor shortages will  eventually begin  to  be  reflected  ininflationary wage pressures, whether  consumer  demand will  slow, andwhat will  happen with  government  expenditures.  So  far,  there  is  noindication that  labor  shortages  have been  severe  enough  to  causerising wage  inflation.  We have  talked a great deal  in  the past  aboutthe  influence of  job uncertainty  on workers, and  the  threat  or  actualinfluence of  competition, both domestic  and foreign,  that  still  seemto  be  keeping wage pressures  in  check.  Our  forecast  suggests  thatconsumer  spending will  be maintained  despite a decline  in  the  growthof  personal  income.  In  line  with the  assessment  in  the  Greenbook, wedo  not  feel  that  current  consumer spending has been buoyedsignificantly by  the  run-up  in  stock market  prices.  Finally, a pointthat remain moderate  in  the near  future.  Federal  spending has been  on adownward  track and  the  recent  announcement by  the  President  thatBob  Parry made,  it  is  likely  that  government demand will12/17/96obtaining a balanced budget would be  a  top priority would  suggest  thatthis  trend will  continue.  Similarly, while  states  may feel  the  needto  initiate many  expensive  infrastructure projects,  majoruncertainties  concerning welfare  and other  federal  programs  that  mayget pushed  down  to  the  states  for  funding will  probably  act  to  dampstate  spending  in  the  near term.All  things  considered,  I expect  economic  growth  to  slowsomewhat  in  the period  immediately  ahead, perhaps  to  a rate  of  around2 percent,  and to  pick up  somewhat  later  in  1997  and into  1998.Inflation and unemployment  are likely  to  hold at  the  levels  that  wehave  been seeing  recently.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

MR. MCTEER.  The  Eleventh District  economy has  continued  itsreduced, modest pace  of  expansion  over  the  recent period.  The  typicalsituation  in  our  District  is  for  employment  growth  to be higher  thanthe  national  average,  but with  the  unemployment  rate higher  as  wellbecause  of  net  in-migration.  That  pattern was  reversed in  the  courseof  1996,  with employment  growth  slowing but  the unemployment  rate  alsofalling.  The latter  fell  to  slightly below  the national  average,  itslowest  level  in  fifteen years.  The unemployment  rate  in Texas  is  5.2percent,  and  if we  took  away  the  counties  along  the Mexican border  itwould be  4.7  percent.  Of  course, on  the basis  of  the commentaries  sofar  this morning,  at  least  before Jack Guynn  spoke,  it  appears  that  weall  have  unemployment  rates below  the national  average,  [laughter]suggesting a Lake Wobegon  economy.  The  recovery in  the Mexican andCalifornian  economies  has  apparently  slowed our  labor  force  growth  andthe  growth  of  anecdotal evidence  of  tight  labor  markets, but  theupward pressure  on wages has  not  abated.  The slow  expansion  ofemployable  labor  apparently  is  constraining output  growth.Factors  contributing  to  strength  in  our area  are  higher oilprices, which are  stimulating  our shrunken energy  sector,  capacitylimits,  which are  limiting  the  rig count  right  now, and the  rebound inthe Mexican economy.  In  the  first  half  of  1996,  Texas  exports  toMexico  increased 17  percent--that  is,  at  a 34  percent  annual rate--andsuch  exports  have  now  surpassed  their pre  peso devaluation  levels.Based on  the period  since  1986,  Texas  exports  to  Mexico  normally wouldgrow at  a rate of  about  14  percent  compared to  a  34  percent  rate  thisyear.  Our construction  sector,  both residential  and commercial,  alsohas been  a strong factor  for  us  in  1996.  Home  prices  are rising  againafter a  long dry period, as  are  office  rents,  and announcements  of  newcommercial projects  are  increasing.  Contributing to  weakness  in  Texasthis  year are  the  drought,  the  downturn  in  the  semiconductor  industryworldwide,  and the  slower  labor  force growth.On  the national  economy we  have no major  quarrel  with theGreenbook.  Our estimate  of  real  GDP growth  in  the  fourth quarter  issomewhat below the Greenbook  estimate of  2.3  percent,  although ourestimate  was made before  the  strong industrial production  number camein for November.  I am not  sure what  to  make  of  it,  but  I am  struck bythe  fact  that  in  both  1995  and 1996  we  have  had  only one  strongquarter  in  each of  those years,  with growth  in  the  other  six  quartersbeing very unimpressive.  I am  sorry  to  see  the  overall  CPI  in  1996break  the  string of  years below  3 percent, but  the  reason  is  primarilyenergy-related.  The opposite  occurred  in  1986 when  sharply declining12/17/96-18-energy prices brought  the  overall  CPI  well  below the core  CPI.  Itseems  to me  that  the  price  of  the dollar  in foreign  exchange markets,the price  of  gold,  commodity prices,  and the  growth  of  the monetaryaggregates  are all  fairly  reassuring  on  the  inflation  front.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman, economic  conditions  in  ourDistrict  have not  not  changed very much  in  the period  since  our  lastmeeting.  Growth overall  remained relatively moderate  compared  toearlier  in  the year.  Most  of  the  anecdotal  information  that  we getfrom our directors  and  others  suggests  a more moderate  tone  thanearlier.  We  see  sluggish conditions  in  some  sectors.  As  Jack Guynnreported  for  the  Atlanta District,  housing  in our  region  clearly hasbeen more  sluggish  lately and  that  is  fairly recent  information.  So,it  is  a  little  out  of  line with  the published data  for November  thatyou mentioned earlier,  Mike.  At  the  same  time,  labor markets  remainexceptionally tight  in  our  region.  We hear  that  from virtuallyeveryone--directors,  other business  contacts,  just  about anybody wetalk  to.  It  appears  that  the  tightness  is  perhaps  greatest right herein the Washington metro  area.  We  are told that  the  inflow of  newworkers  into  the  labor  force here  has  slowed  significantly.  Businessat  temp  agencies  for both skilled  and unskilled labor  in  this  area  isbooming, and  again we  are told  that  the  supply of  new workers has beenconstrained.  We  see  evidence  of  tight  labor markets  just  abouteverywhere.  Yesterday, when Marvin Goodfriend and  I were  driving upInterstate  95  from  Richmond, my eyes  happened  to  fall  on a mudflap  ofan  18-wheeler  ahead of  me,  and  they were advertising  for  truckdrivers.  I have  the number  if  anybody would like  it!  [Laughter]At  the national  level,  we have  no  strong  reason to  disagreewith  the Greenbook's  forecast  that  real  GDP  will  grow at  a ratesomewhere  near  its  longer-term trend  and  that  CPI  inflation willremain moderate at  a  little under  3 percent,  at  least with  the  help ofthe  recent  technical  adjustments  to  that  index.  In  the  Greenbookscenario,  the unemployment  rate  stays  near  5-1/4 percent, with  thecontinuation of  only a gradual  rise  in hourly workers'  compensationalong the  lines  of  what  we have  seen  recently.  Not very  long ago,  anunemployment  rate  this  low would have been accompanied by expectationsof  greater upward pressures  on both wages  and prices,  and I have  toconfess  to  a  little nervousness  on  this  score.  But  I think  the  staffis  right  in pointing  in particular  to  the  considerable capacity  thatexists  in  a number of  manufacturing  industries.  We  see  that  intextiles  and  furniture  in  our  District.  And while  I am not  ready touncross my  fingers  yet,  I think  the near-term risks  in the  Greenbookprojections  are  more balanced  than  they were 3 months or  so  ago,especially on  the  inflation side.  Some  of  the  points  that Bob  Parrymade  are  very relevant  here.  In  a sense,  the picture  might  even  bebrighter  in  view of  the  emerging  consensus  that  the  CPI  overstatesactual  inflation by something  like  a percentage point.  With both  theoverall  CPI  and  the  core CPI  projected by  the  Greenbook  to  remainbelow 3 percent  in  1997  and  1998,  this  would  imply that  the  underlyingtrue  inflation  rate  is  in  some  sense closer  to  2 percent, which wouldmean  that  we  may be  closing in  on price  stability at  least  after  helpfrom those  technical  adjustments.Having  said all  of  that  and before  anyone  concludes  that  Ihave  become complacent about  inflation--[Laughter]12/17/96-19-

[SECTION]

SPEAKER  (?). You  are  ready  to  declare victory?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I am  not ready  to  do  that.  In a veryimportant sense,  and  this  is  really the  main point I want  to  make, Ithink we  still have  some  distance to  go before we  can be  comfortablethat we  have  achieved price  stability  in the  way we  have  defined it.The  old Neal  Resolution  language, which we endorsed,  defines  pricestability as  a condition where  expectations  of  future  inflation do notplay a significant  role  in  economic decision-making.  I think  one  ofthe best  indicators  of  inflation expectations  is  the  long-term bondrate.  That  rate  averaged around  3-1/2  percent  in the  late  1950s  andabout  4 percent  in the  early  1960s when  the CPI  inflation  rate  was  ina  range of  1/2  percent  to  1-1/2  percent  at  an  annual rate.  Today thelong-term bond rate  is  at  6-1/2  percent,  about  the midpoint of  itsrecent  range  between a  little below 6 percent  and a little  over  7percent.  There  is  not  a  lot  of  reason  to  think  that  the  real  long-term bond rate  is  much different now than  it  was  in  the  earlier periodwhen  it  appeared to  average  around 3 percent.  That  seems  to  begenerally  consistent with the  surveys  depicted  in  the Bluebook, whichsuggest  that  long-term inflation  expectations are  still  on  the  orderof  3-1/2  percent  today.  Alternatively, if  we compare  nominal  rates  inthe  earlier period with nominal  rates  today and attribute most  of  thedifference  to  inflation expectations  between  the  two periods,  theimplication would be  that  inflation expectations  are  anywhere  from 2-1/2  to  3 percentage points  higher today  than  they were  in  the  late1950s  and early 1960s.  Beyond  that,  the  volatility of  bond  rates  is  alot  greater  than  it  was  in the  earlier period and  that volatilityalmost  certainly reflects,  at  least  to  some  extent, more volatileinflation  expectations.So,  Mr.  Chairman,  I would conclude  that  we  are  still  somedistance  from achieving price  stability  in  the Neal  Resolution sense,and I think we  need  to  remain  vigilant going  forward.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR.  BOEHNE.  I am  reassured  that  President Broaddus  isstanding  firm  in his  commitment  to  price stability.  I was gettingworried about  that!The  Philadelphia region  continues  on a modest  growth  trend,with most  sectors reflecting  this  trend.  Attitudes  are positive andthe  outlook  is  generally positive as  well.  Labor markets  aregenerally  snug, although places  like  the  southern-most part  of  NewJersey and parts  of  Pennsylvania  still  have relatively highunemployment  rates.  Getting  "qualified workers"  is  becoming anincreasingly familiar  refrain among business people.  It  is  somethingthat  one  hears  almost  regularly.  Average wage  increases, however,still  remain in  the  3 to  4 percent  area,  although I think theyprobably are  concentrated more  in  the  3-1/2  to  4 percent  range.Almost  everyone  trying to  sell  something,  from  large businesses  tostreet vendors,  still  reports  stiff  competition, which  tempers  thetendency  to  raise  prices  in  this  kind of  environment.There is  not much to  be  added on  the national  economy.  Ithink  the key points  are  that  the  economy appears  to  have  successfullymade  the  adjustment downward  from unsustainable  growth  rates earlier;it  appears  to  be on a more  sustainable  track,  and I think  that  is  the12/17/96-20-outlook.  On  inflation, we  are still  operating in  a cautionary zone.Performance  is  better,  actually remarkably  better, than  one might haveexpected on  the  basis  of  historical  experience.  So,  we are doingreasonably well  there  and  are generally  looking at  a positive,  evenenviable, position  to  be  in.  As  has been pointed out,  there  areworries  and potential  problems,  and we need  to  stay alert.  But we canalso  continue  to  be  patient.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Ninth Districteconomy is  still  characterized by  favorable business  conditions  almostthroughout.  Perhaps  the most noteworthy  thing to  report  relates  to  arecent meeting that  we had with about  30  business  leaders.  The moststriking thing they  had to  report  is  something  I have  commented  onhere  but  they  certainly emphasized  it,  namely, how  tight  labor marketsare and how difficult  it  is  to  find both  skilled  and unskilledworkers.  This  is  translating  into  higher wages.  The wage pressuresare by no  means pervasive, but  I think  it  is  fair  to  say  that  largerwage  increases  are  becoming more common.  The business  leaders  talkedabout new hires  being increasingly expensive, both  because  of  theskills  or  lack of  skills  they bring  and because they  are  finding thatat  least  in  some  cases  they have  to  offer more generous  benefitpackages,  especially  to  attract  part-timers.  Those  conditions  havebeen  in evidence  for  some  time  and I think  they probably haveintensified a bit.As  far  as  the national  economy  is  concerned,  I am generallycomfortable with  the path  of  the Greenbook  forecast.  I am hardpressed  to  think of  something that  would materially  change  thatpattern going  forward,  at  least  through  1997.  To  be  sure,  there  arerisks  that  aggregate  demand could either  fall  short  or  turn out  to  besomewhat  stronger  than  envisioned in  the  forecast,  but  it  is  hard  forme  to  assess  those  risks  with  any degree  of  confidence.  Without beingvery rigorous  about  this,  the  risk  that  I, at  least,  can identify mostclearly  is  on the  supply  side.  With  labor markets  in  the  shape  theyare  in  and with what we  are  seeing  in  wages  and  are starting  to  hearabout  compensation more  generally, there  is  clearly a risk that  thosepressures  are going  to  build.  We  need  to  keep  our eye  on  theimplications  for  inflation going  forward,  at  least  in  the  short  term.

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  The Eighth  District  economycontinues  to  grow at  a  steady pace.  District  retailers  report  thatearlier,  and most  are  expecting a  strong holiday season.  Sales  theweekend after  Thanksgiving were especially robust.  Despite  a  somewhatlackluster autumn, most  Eighth  District  contacts were  optimistic  aboutincreased their planned production  slightly  for  the  fourth quarter  of1996  and  the  first  quarter  of  1997,  so  District  production  is  runningabove year-earlier  levels  in  autos.  Payroll  employment in  the  EighthDistrict  rose  at  an  annualized rate of  1.9  percent  from July toThe  local  employment effects  resulting  from Monsanto's  division intotwo  companies  are highly uncertain.  Monsanto  plans  to  eliminate  1,500to  2,500  of  its  28,000  jobs  worldwide.  About  4,600  of  its  employees12/17/96-21-work at  company headquarters  in  St.  Louis.  The  employment effectsresulting  from  the Boeing merger with McDonnell Douglas,  which  is  thelargest  employer  in St.  Louis,  are  also uncertain.  Labor marketsremain  tight  around  the  District.  Hiring  and keeping  qualifiedworkers,  as  a number  of  others  have mentioned,  is  still  a big  concernfor  District  companies.  Materials  prices  are  generally  stable  toslightly higher.  Real  estate markets  are  strong  in  the  District,  withyear-to-date permits  levels  above  1995  levels.  Loan demand,particularly for  business  loans,  remains  robust,  and District bankscontinue  to  record high profits  with  only a  slight  increase  innonperforming  loans.  Farmers  have had  an excellent  year,  with yieldsgenerally above  average  and crop prices  comparatively high.At  the  national  level,  relatively  low inflation  in recentyears  has been  good for  investment  and growth.  Tight  labor marketsare reflected in unemployment  rates  that  remain  low by historicalstandards.  Although  real  growth has  slowed  from  the  rapid  second-quarter pace,  it  remains  near  our estimate  of  the  sustainable  trend--in  the  2 to  2-1/2  percent  range.  This pattern  is  observed  in thelabor market  as  well.  The  average net  increase  in payroll  employment,which was 240,000  per  month over  the  first  eight months  of  the year,slowed  to  113,000  over  the  three  months  through  November.  Thataverage  increase  is  close  to  the  sustainable  growth  in  the  laborforce.On a  fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis,  CPI  inflationis  forecast  to  be  3.2  percent  in 1996  compared with 2.7  percent  in  theprior year.  Although  the  1997  staff  forecast has  a return  to  the  2.7percent  level,  more  than half  of  that  improvement  is  due  to  technicalchanges  in  the  way the  BLS  computes  the  CPI.  Furthermore,  risingaverage  hourly  earnings, weak productivity growth,  and  firm  energyprices  suggest  that  there  are upside  risks  to  this  forecast.  In  anyevent,  the  fact  of  a  1/2-point  rise  in  1996  inflation may harm ourcredibility  in ways  that  cannot be  repaired by  the  staff'sconfidential  forecast  of  a 1997  inflation decline.Our policy report  to  Congress  last  February  suggested  that wewould resist pressures  that might  push  inflation above  recent  trends.Economic  forecasters  have  often  interpreted our policy as  a  3 percentcap  on CPI  inflation.  Events  in  1996 put  us  at  considerable  risk oflosing credibility  for  even  that  modest  goal.  In my view, we  shouldreaffirm our  commitment  to  resist  inflation  above  3 percent.  At  thesame  time,  we  should  continue  to  emphasize that  all  we  influence  inthe  long  run  is  inflation.  I personally believe  we  should go  furtherand  announce targets  for bringing  inflation down over  time, but  anannouncement  in  February  of  an  intended cap  at  3 percent  for  inflationwould be  a good start.  Thank you.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman, economic  conditionsin  the  Second District  have  been mixed, but  on balance  they have  beenpositive  since  our  last meeting.  Private-sector job  growth, which hadbeen  above trend earlier  this  year, has  slowed, but unemployment  ratesare  still  rather  good.  The 5.9  percent  rate  in New York  State  isholding at  a 6-year  low, and  the  6.2  percent  rate  in New Jersey  isstill  relatively good for  that  state  as  well.  Retail  sales  generallyhave  been running on  or  above plan  throughout  November  according to12/17/96-22-our sources,  and  the  traditional holiday  shopping  season  seems  to  beoff  to  a good start.  Rising consumer  confidence  and  record bonuses,including virtually astronomical bonuses  on Wall  Street,  also bodewell  for  consumer  spending.  In New York, we are  getting an  incrediblewave  of  tourism,  in  fact  to  a point  where hotel  rates  are up  about  15percent and hotel  occupancy  is  very high.  New York  State'sresidential  real  estate markets picked up  in  October,  and Manhattan'scommercial  real  estate  markets  remain  strong.  The  regional  surveys  ofpurchasing managers  indicate persistent  strength  in  the manufacturingsector  and some  easing of price  pressures  in  that  sector  as  well.Consumer price  inflation  in  the New York and northeastern New Jerseyarea held  steady  at  2.8  percent  in November, so we  are  looking goodcompared  to  the  rest  of  the  country.On  the national  level,  we  are basically  in line with theGreenbook forecast.  Our  forecast  for  real  growth  is  just  a bit  lower,so  it  is  a  little more  comfortable  in relation  to  growth withincapacity.  But we  share  the  concern  that  others  have  expressed thatthe  risks are  slightly on  the  high side  as  regards  price pressures.However,  I believe  that  the  risk the  Committee  has  taken in  the  courseof  this  year by assuming  that  the  economy was  in  fact  behavingsomewhat  differently has  turned  out  to  be a risk  extremely well  takenand  that  the present  stance  of  monetary policy  is  correct.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I do not  know whether  we have  been smart  orlucky,  but we do  seem  to  be  blessed with a nearly ideal  economy thatis  growing at  a rate  very close  to  potential.  I have no  reason  toquarrel  with  the Greenbook  forecast.  Certainly, there  is  reason  forconcern about  future  inflation, given the  tight  labor markets  and  thebeginnings  of  accelerating wage  increases.  But  I think we  ought  toremember  that  if  we  can  keep  labor  markets  tight,  in  the  long  run weinflation.  If  tight  labor  markets  encourage  training,  give  more jobexperience  to  workers  who would not  otherwise have  had it,  encourageinvestment  in  efficient  equipment and productivity-enhancing processes--and  there  is  a good deal  of  evidence  to  think that  this  does  happen--then we  are  improving  our potential  for  economic  growth withoutinflation in  the  future.  The wage  increases  that  we  are beginning tosee  at  the  low end of  the  wage  scale  also  augur well  in  the  sense thatthey will  encourage  the  transition from welfare  to  work, whichhopefully will  be made  over  the  next several  years,  and will  give ussome  new workers with  job  experience.  Clearly,  the  most worrisomeproblem  on  the  horizon is  the  stock market,  but  I am not  sure how thatwill work  out.  It  could  contribute  to  an  upward bounce  in  consumerspending, which was  suggested by  some  of  you,  or  to  a  significantcorrection  that  will  reduce  confidence and  cut  spending  in  the  future.I share  the  staff's  optimism  about  the prospects  for  a budgetagreement,  and  I want  to  underline  that  because  I have been fussing  atthem  for  about  six  months  for being  too pessimistic.  They havefinally gotten a little  more optimistic  about  the budget  outlook,which I think  is  right.  I believe  the  Congress  and  the  President willget  together  over  the  next  few months  and work out  a deal  that  willkeep  the  deficit  from rising  in  1997  and bring it  down moresignificantly  in  1998.12/17/96-23-The main  element has  to be  a Medicare agreement  on reducedreimbursement  rates, possibly a means  testing of  the  Part  B premium,and  some more aggressive action on Medicare  fraud;  such  action alreadyseems  to  be paying  off  quite well.  The  Congress  and the  Administra-tion  could get  hung up on what  to  do  about  Medicaid, but  I sense  lessintensity  in  the Congressional  Republicans'  demands  for block grantsas  the  states begin  to  realize  that  they have  taken  on a lot  already.We may actually see  some  softening of  the harsh  treatment  of  legalimmigrants  under welfare reform, but  I do not  expect  that  that willmean  a lot more spending,  although some  easing for  disabled legalimmigrants  seems  likely.  We  also may see  more near-term cuts  indiscretionary spending, creating  a more  realistic  track over  time  forspending.  The previous  spending agreements had unrealistictrajectories  in  that  they had precipitous  declines  in  discretionaryspending in  the period  close  to  the year  2002.I think  that there  is  even a chance  that  the  President  andthe  Congress might  tackle  the  longer-run  Social  Security problem bytaking advantage of  the  Boskin Report  and  solving what  is  a relativelyeasy long-run Social  Security problem with  some downward shift  in theCPI  adjustment, probably not  1.1  percent but maybe half  of  that,  andsome  future benefit  cuts  in  the  form of  a higher retirement age.  Ifthat  were  to  happen, and  I admit  that  is  pretty optimistic,  it  is notclear what  the  near-term effect would be.  Spending would be reducedsome as  the benefits  were pared back  slightly, but  it might  have  apositive effect  on confidence.  If  it  is  true  that consumers  arespending  less  and  saving more because  they  are worried about  SocialSecurity and their  long-term retirement  incomes,  we  might  actually seea positive effect on  consumption.

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  I had  a joint meeting of  all  threeof  our  boards of  directors  last  week and  it  included a go-around  ofthe directors.  The  most commonly used word  to  describe  their businessactivity was  "flat"--flat at  currently  high levels  of  activity withexpectations  that  activity  in 1997  will  be  about  the  same overall  asin 1996.  In  the motor vehicles  area,  there  is  an  expectation--fromthe  suppliers' side  at  least--that production next year will  be  downabout  1 percent  or so.  Because motor vehicles--both autos  and  trucks--are  extremely  important  to  our region, developments  in  that  industrynot only  affect  the  reality but  also  the perceptions  of what  ishappening.  There  is  also  an  expectation  among the  suppliers  that  theprices of  materials  are going to  be  down  in  1997,  so  they expect  theirWith regard to  the  steel  industry, we  did get  informationthat was  a little different.  Most of  it  was  on  the  outlook for  steelprices.  In  that  industry, mini-mills  that  have  been underconstruction  for  some  time will  be coming  on  stream next  year andadding to  capacity.  Moreover, the  growing efficiency of  theintegrated companies  and expanding  capacity abroad--we are  seeing moresources  of  steel  supplies  from around the world--suggest  that  steelprices will  be  flat  at  best.  In  fact,  one  of  our directors who  isvery much  involved  in  steel  feels  that  steel prices  at  the  end of  1997are  likely to  be below where  they  are  today, and as  Mike  Prell  notedthey  currently are below where they were  at  the beginning  of  thisyear.12/17/96-24-There  are  growing concerns  about  the  outlook for  residentialand nonresidential  construction.  The  feeling is  that  the  residentialprojects that  are  now being completed  are not being replaced  in theconstruction pipeline,  so  that  as  they  are  finished next yearresidential  construction activity will be  coming down.  On thecommercial  side,  there  is  a special  concern about  too many shoppingcenters--too much retail  space.  The bankers  say  that  they aretightening up on  credit  for  this  type  of  lending.  They feel  that  theyhave been  extending  too much credit  for  the construction  of retailspace  on  terms  with which  they  are no  longer  comfortable.Employment  is  generally characterized as  flat  at very  lowlevels  of  unemployment.  We  simply do  not  have very much population orlabor  force  growth in  the region  anymore.  I think people  are goingback to  California!  That  population trend  is  expected to  continue.One of  the  remarks  that Governor Rivlin just  made about  theway the  causality  runs  in  labor markets  is  reinforced by viewsexpressed by some  of  our directors.  One  of  our directors,  who  is  nowleaving  the board,  said that  when he arrived  inflation psychology wasan  issue.  He does  not believe  that anymore.  He  thinks  it  has beenreplaced by what  he  calls  a productivity psychology.  He notes  that  inmanagement retreats  and in  meetings of  boards  of  directors,  people donot  talk  about  inflation.  They talk  about  efficiency and aboutproductivity and  they  lay  their plans  for  the next  year and set  theirlonger-run strategies with  the  objective  of  accomplishing greaterproductivity.  The director believes  that  the productivity psychologyis  pervading business  organizations  and  that  employees  understand verywell  that  that  is  what  is  driving  their companies.On  the  stock market,  one  director made a comment  that  Ithought was  intriguing, so  I tested it  with a few other  individuals--Ihad a sort  of  aggregation problem.  The  comment was  that  the  shares  ofan  individual's  firm were fairly priced  in  the market  or maybe  alittle undervalued, but  the  stock  of other business  firms wasovervalued.  [Laughter]On  the  national  economy,  I do  not pay very much attention  towhat  the  Commerce Department  reports  on  real  output  and even  less  towhat  the  Board staff projects  for  real  output.  [Laughter]  What  MikePrell  does  with the  real  growth measure makes  sense,  but  I believe  itis  increasingly  flawed conceptually.  We don't  know how  to  defineoutput  and we have all  the  related problems and concerns  aboutproductivity  that  we  have discussed a number  of  times.  The numberssimply are  not  squaring up with  what I, at  least--and  I think a lot  ofyou, too--hear  and see  is  going  on  in  the  economy.  In  any event,  I donot  think that  the  growth measure  has much  to  do with  the purchasingpower of  the  dollar.  I find  the uncertainties  about  the  linkagebetween measures  of  inflation and of  real  output  and productivity  tobe  something more  than I can deal  with when  I am  so  unsure  about howto  estimate output  and productivity.I do  spend a fair  amount  of  time  looking at  the pricestatistics.  Of  course,  there  is  a danger  in  that we  can fall  into  thetrap of  thinking that  inflation  is  caused by rising prices,  but  it  isnot.  [Laughter]  I do  look at  the  numbers  for prices  and I look atthe numbers  for wages.  Now, even  in  theory the only way we  can havewage-push inflation  is  for  firms  to  pay people more  than the  value of12/17/96-25-their  marginal product.  We do not  find a  lot  of  businesses  that  claimto  be paying  their workers  more  than  they are  worth.  However,  when  Ilook  at  the Greenbook  projections  of  the deflators--the  chain-weighteddeflator or  the  gross  domestic  purchases  deflator--out  to  1998  and  seethat  uptick  out  there  in 1998,  that  certainly gives me  reason  topause.  When we  come back  together in  February, I am going  to  be  veryinterested in  seeing what  the numbers  look  like  going out  for  fiveyears.  I think  a crucial  issue  for  this  Committee at  this  point isthe  inflation  forecast beyond  1998.  Nothing that  we could  conceive  ofdoing  today or  in  the  early part of  1997  is  going  to  have much effecton  reported rates  of  inflation in  1997.  The  implications  of  currentpolicy  for  the year  1998  are  a matter  of  interest,  but much more  so  iswhat  the  inflation trend will  be beyond  1998.  Implicit  in  theGreenbook's  1998 numbers  is  an  inflation  trend  that  is  rising beyond1998.  And yet  I am very puzzled because when  I look at  the  Greenbookprojections  of  nominal  GDP  for  1997,  those  in  the  current  Greenbookare  the  lowest  that  we have  seen  since  the Greenbook began  to  includeprojections  for  1997.  About  one year  ago,  at  the  time  of  the Januarymeeting,  the  country was  in  a funk, with  the  economy perceived as  badand getting worse.  That  sentiment  changed by  spring, and  going  intothe  summer  the  economy was  seen as  booming and  getting stronger.  Now,the psychology may be back almost  to  where  it  was one  year  ago.  Thenumbers  are  softer  in  terms  of  nominal  spending growth  in  1997  and wehave  had three  Greenbooks now with projections  of  1998  nominal GDP,and each  of  those projections  has been  lower  than  the prior one.  So,the  trend for nominal  income  growth  is  going  in  one  direction, yet  Iam  expecting staff  to  say  that  after  1998 nominal  GDP  is  going  to  growat  a faster  rate and produce  higher  inflation.  What  I would  like  thestaff  to  do,  at  least  to  humor  me,  is  to  show  us  what policy  and theenvironment would look  like  if  we  set  an objective  of  stable  prices  atthe  end of  five  years.  We  have  a pretty good  idea  of what  it  wouldmean  in  terms  of  nominal  income.  We  even have  a pretty good  idea ofwhat  it might  mean  in  terms  of  nominal  interest  rates--they would belower  than  they are  today.  What kind  of heroic  assumptions  would onehave  to  make  in  your analytical  framework, as  it  relates  to  growth  inoutput  and productivity, that  would be  consistent  with that  objectivewithout  first widening  the  output  gap  or pushing up  the unemploymentrate?  I think  it  is  possible  to  put  that  scenario  together  in  somealternative  framework other  than  a gap analysis.

MR. KELLEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I have  very little  to  add  thismorning, and  I will  be  very brief.  As  we  know,  this  was a very  shortintermeeting  interval,  and  it  seems  to  me  that  the  incoming data  havehad very  little  significance  for  policy in  the  short  run.  So,  Ibelieve  that  on balance  the  economic  situation very much calls  for  thestatus  quo.  The Greenbook  always makes  for  fascinating reading, but  Ihave  to  say that  the current  edition  is  as  bland  as  any I have  seensince  I have  been here, which  I do  not mean as  a  complaint or  acriticism.  That  is  the way  things are.  We  continue  to  be  in  a periodof  watchful waiting;  that  is  what  seems  to be  appropriate  in my view.This period is  not going  to  go  on  forever, but  it  does  seem  tocontinue  at  least  for now.  I would like  to  add that  I think  that  therisks  continue  to  become  a  little more  symmetric,  but  I am  in no  rushto  change  the direction  of  the  intermeeting bias.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.12/17/96-26-

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank  you, Mr.  Chairman.  The economicexpansion still  seems  to  be  holding in  a sustainable  zone.  We havefurther  confirmation of  the  slowdown  in  the  third quarter that  we wereanticipating.  The  fourth-quarter results  have been mixed but  seem  topoint  to  a marginally  stronger  economy as  we  reach  the year-end.  Thequestion  for  us now  is  how much  momentum the  economy will  carry into1997.  I have been  impressed by  the mixture of  the  reports  around thetable  today.  There  are  some  areas  of  strength in  the  economy:  astrong  labor market,  low unemployment,  shortages  of  certain types  ofworkers,  fewer layoffs  this  year  than  in recent  years,  increased wagesand  income,  and reasonably  strong  consumer  confidence that  is  perhapsrelated to  the strength  in  the  labor markets  and  to  some wealtheffects  from  the  stock market  gains,  at  least until  a  few weeks  ago.Housing markets  could be  getting  a boost  from lower  mortgage rates,and we have  some  evidence  of  that  in  the  data for November  that wereceived  this  morning.  There could  even be  some  increased consumerspending  capacity  if  a mini  mortgage  refinancing wave gets  going.  Onthe  business  side,  commercial  construction has strengthened  as  thecurrent  business  cycle has  lengthened and put pressure  on  capacity.We  are even  getting reports  that  available  commercial  rental  space  isnow becoming  scarce  in  some areas.  I never  thought  that  I would behearing  such reports  at  this  juncture.  Industrial production bouncedback  strongly in November.In  support  of  this  increased activity,  the  external  financingcost  of  capital  has  been relatively  low.  Profit  levels  and  cash  flowalso have permitted internal  funding.  In  this  financing  environment,business  fixed investment has  consistently outpaced the  Greenbookprojections.  Inventories  seem  to  be  reasonably balanced as we  goforward,  so  we should  not  face  a workout  from an  inventory overhangnor  a slowdown  because  of  shortages.Even  in  this  environment,  I think  there are  some potentialproblems  for  the  economy.  One  I would point  to  is  consumer  spending.While  such  spending is  unlikely  to  fade  given  the  strong  labor marketand high confidence  levels,  it  is  not  likely  to  grow much  faster  thanthe  rate  of  increase  in  incomes.  Consumer debt  levels  continue  to bea  constraint.  We have  worked  through all  of  the pent-up demand.There  is  also  the whole  question of  labor market  uncertainty.  Duringmy  first  two years  on  this  Committee,  I  talked a  lot  about  thissubject.  I got tired  of  talking about  it  so  it  dropped off my  list  ofthings  to  mention,  but  the  issue  does  remain.Another potential  uncertainty  is  the  stock market  situation,which was highlighted by Mike Prell  in  the Greenbook.  It  may well bethat  the  cold  shower  that  was given  to  the markets  by  the Chairman  mayhave  done  the  trick.  In  any case,  market participants are  taking  asecond serious  look  at  their valuations.  In  fact,  somebody  that  Italk to  fairly  regularly  tells me  that  traders  continue  to  be  obsessedby the  Chairman's  remarks.I will  turn  to  another  problem that  I place  in  the potentialrisk  category.  I hope  that  Governor Rivlin  is  right  in her  optimismregarding  the  federal budget  outlook.  But  if  some kind  of  budget  dealis  not worked out,  I  think the markets  will  likely extract  a premiumvia higher  interest  rates,  and that  could have  a retarding effect  onthe  economy.12/17/96-27-Another risk  that  has  been mentioned today  is  inflation.  Itseems  that  "benign" and  "tamed" are  the more recent  adjectives  ofchoice.  That  certainly  seems  fair  for  the  major core  indexes,  thedeflators,  and commodities  including  gold.  But  energy  and  food arestill  experiencing price  increases.  If,  as  expected, those  increasestail  off  or decline  as  supply  pressures  ease,  we  could see  someto  the  economy, particularly  to  the  fairly  fragile  consumer  spendingsituation.  Wages  are  another potential  pressure point  for  inflationand the  economy.  Maybe we  are  experiencing enough  productivityimprovement  in enough  industries  to  keep  the pressure  off prices,  andthere  still  is  the  safety valve  of profits.  But  either prices  orprofits  are going  to  have  to  change  in the  future  if  labor marketsremain  tight.In  sum, I think  that  the  outlook  for  sustainable  growth  lookseven better  from the  December vantage point  than  it  did  in Septemberor November, perhaps  with a bit more  strength going  into  1997  than wehad  earlier  thought.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. The  limited amount  of  data that  we now haveavailable since  the  last  meeting does not  alter  the picture  of  theeconomy, and that  picture  is  a remarkably good one.  Economic  growthhas  now slowed  to  trend.  I read core measures  of  inflation as  stableto  still  declining.  The unemployment  rate  remains  locked  in  a low butnarrow band.  Still,  I think we all  appreciate that  good monetarypolicy  is  forward-looking.  So,  the  relevant  question is,  what  changecan we look  forward  to with  enough  confidence  to  justify a  change  inpolicy today?Given  that we  are beginning  from  full  employment, onejustification  for  a policy change would be  a  strong conviction  thatgrowth  over  the  forecast horizon will  be persistently above  or  belowtrend.  But  the  risks  related  to  growth  have  really become morebalanced  over  the  last  several months.  The  Greenbook  forecastindicates  trend growth  immediately ahead.  The discussion around  thetable  suggests  that  few of  us  have a conviction  that  would justify avery different  forecast.  I compared  the Greenbook  forecast  to  five  ofmy favorite  private-sector forecasts,  and  the range  is  remarkablytight.  On  a  fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis,  the range  fornext year  is  from a  low of  2.0  percent  to  a high of  2.4 percent.  Thisis  a very narrow range.  Unemployment  rates  tend  to  be  slightly higherthan  in  the  staff  forecast;  they  jump off  from  about  5.4  percent,which  is  the  current  rate,  rather  than  the  lower  5.2  percent  rate  inthe Greenbook, but again  these  forecasts  are  in  a very narrow rangethat  pretty much encompasses the  estimates of  trend growth.When we begin  from  trend  growth,  I think  one  thing that  wemight  also  recognize  is  that  slight  differences  in  the  forecast  forGDP growth, differences  that  are much  smaller  than  the margin  offorecast  error, produce qualitatively different  forecasts.  A  forecastof  slightly slower GDP  growth  at  the  lower  limit of  that  range,  like  2percent, produces  rising  unemployment rates,  as  in  the  consensus  BlueChip  forecast, whereas  a slightly higher  forecast  of  GDP growthproduces  a degree of  further  tightness  in  the  economy and  furtherrisks  of  rising  inflation  that  none of us  views  as  acceptable.12/17/96-28-A  second justification  for policy  change would be  theconviction that we  are already below NAIRU  and not  likely  to move backto  it  quickly enough to  prevent  an uptick  in inflation.  This  isbasically the  staff  forecast,  and my view has been and  continues  to  bethat  this  is  the  most  serious  risk  factor  in  the  outlook.  Yet, we getstuck in  place  because we  continue  to  be  confronted by the  reality  ofstable  to  declining  core  inflation  in  the  face  of  this  prevailing  lowunemployment  rate.  So,  we wait  for  additional  data  to  resolve  ourdoubts.  The  risk  of waiting,  judging  from the modest  rise  ininflation  in  the  staff  forecast,  is  not  very great.  Still,  it  isprobably worthwhile noting  that  in all  of  the  five private-sectorforecasts  that  I  looked  at,  there  are  increases  in core  inflation  overthe next  year or  two.  That  is  a pervasive  tendency that  just  abouteverybody  is  worried about.  I think we need  to  keep  that  in  mind.Just a  little historical  perspective:  I think the  majorthreat  to  an  expansion  comes  from an ultimate  overshooting of  demandrelative  to  productive  capacity and  from  the  resulting  acceleration  ofinflation.  I do  not believe  that  business  cycles  are  dead.  Rather, Ithink there  has been a  coincidence  of  events  that  so  far  havepermitted us  to  avoid  pervasive excess  demand  and rising pricepressures.  I want  to  suggest  a  few of  them that  we have not  discussedvery much.  Demand  is  always  chasing supply during  the  expansion, butI think supply  has been more elusive  than  normal  in  this  particularcycle.  Effective  labor  supply has  been  increased by an apparentfalling NAIRU.  In addition, we have had very strong  capital  spendingin  this  expansion, and  as  a result  we have  seen very rapid growth  inindustrial  capacity.  So,  if  we  look  at  the  price pressures  in  theproduct  markets,  they  seem even better  contained  than  the pricepressures  in  the  labor markets.  I think  that  is  an  importantdistinction.  One reason why this  absence  of  pricing leverage  makessense  is  a lack  of  excess  demand pressure  in  the product  markets  thatmakes  firms more  cautious  about  raising wages  in  response  to  laborincreases  that  do  occur.  Other  factors  that  have  inhibited  the  normalbuoyancy  in  demand at  this  stage  in  the  cycle  have been  the  continuingfiscal  restraint and  the  persistent  drag  from net exports.  So,  supplyhas  been increasing more rapidly perhaps  than normal,  demand has beenless  buoyant,  and that  is  what has  created the  current  environment.But  as  I said,  the business  cycle  is  not dead;  historysuggests  that  the  risks  are tilted  in favor  of  demand ultimatelyovershooting productive  capacity and causing  higher  inflation.  Whilethis  should not prevent  us  from enjoying  the  current  balancedprosperity and good performance,  it  does  suggest  vigilance rather  thancomplacency as  we move  into  1997.

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor  Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I think  that  in  spiteof  your best  efforts,  1997  is  going  to  be  a very good year  forirrational  exuberance.  [Laughter]  I take  the  Greenbook as  ExhibitOne.  In mid-1993  I got  into  a little  trouble  because  the wireservices quoted a quip  I made at  the beginning of  a  speech  to  theeffect  that  monetary policy had been  reduced to  the  number  3 or  3something:  3 percent  inflation,  3 percent  growth, 3 percent  fed fundsrate.  Now, I have  to  change  it  to  2 something because  what  I see  in12/17/96-29-the  Greenbook  forecast  is  quarterly GDP  growth rates  of  2.1,  2.3,  2.3,2.2,  2.1,  and  1.9  percent;  and  for  the  implicit  deflator  from thesecond quarter  of  1997  it  goes  2.1,  2.0,  2.0,  2.3,  2.2,  2.2  and 2.3percent.  I suppose  the  real  fed funds  rate  is  "2 something" percent,too.  So  there we are.  That  is  known  on Wall  Street as  the  Goldilockseconomy, and  that  perception is  exactly what  is  causing the  stocknot  read  it  to  my kids.  I can cite Green Eggs  and Ham by heart, whichI will  spare  you,  [laughter]  but  I cannot  remember  too much aboutGoldilocks  except  that  there  were three bears.  So,  here are  the  threebears  that  I think are  going  to  give us  a little  further  irrationalexuberance  in  1997,  and when we write  the history of  1997,  we will  askourselves why we didn't realize  it  at  the  time.The  first relates  to  the budget  deal  cited by GovernorRivlin.  I share  her  optimism that a deal  will  be  reached, but  I alsohave  a substantial  amount  more cynicism than  she  was willing  toexpress.  I think the  core  of  the budget deal  will  be,  as  it  is withmost political  deals,  to  make  things  sound a lot better  than  they are.If  we  look at  the  Greenbook we note,  for example,  that  the  highemployment budget  deficit actually rises  in  the next  year  in  spite  ofall  the  talk around town  and during the  campaign about  record lowdeficits.  Basically FY97  is  locked in.  So,  we might  think  of  1997,at  least  from  the point  of  view of  perceptions,  as  the  "all  gain, nopain" year.  I also  agree  that  there probably will  be  a Medicare deal,which will make us  all  feel  better.  My  suspicion  is  that  the  rhetoricwill  focus  on  a line that  the  President  used, namely, that we willhave  extended  the  life of  Medicare by  10  years.  Now, I actuallychased this  quotation  down with some  CEA staff  when  I was  in Paris.The  President  said  it  first  in  1995  and  the  10  years  he had  in mindwere  through 2005,  which really is  an  extension  of  4 years.  But sinceeveryone will  be  signing on,  everyone will be  saying that we  extendedMedicare by 10  years.  The  examples  that you gave--a  little  squeeze  onthe  reimbursement rates  for doctors  and a tad of  means  testing are notgoing  to  hurt anybody--will make  it  sound as  if  the  Medicare problemhas  been put  off  for  10  years.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  His  10  years  did not  include  the means testing.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Did not  include means  testing--so maybe itsinclusion will  get  us  to  11  or  12  years,  but  it  still will  not be  thatfar  into  the  future.  In  addition,  I think both OMB  and CBO  havebecome a little  too  optimistic with regard  to  tax  receipts.  Theydiscovered that  the  increased tax  receipts  were not  from capitalgains, which should make us  all  pause  a little because  that means  thatthose  gains are  not being realized and are  not  in the  spending streamboosting consumption right  now.  Instead,  the  discovery was  that  theextra tax receipts  were coming  from higher  small  business  receipts.That was  certainly true  for  1994  and  1995.  People who were  downsizedformed their  own  businesses  and started paying the  very high tax ratesthat  small  business  people pay basically because  their  fringe benefitsare  not deductible.  But  as  our  staff  discovered, small  businessprofit margins  are  now starting  to  be squeezed.  I think  that  thesmall  business  and not  from capital  gains--will  in  retrospect prove  tobe  false.  We will  look back and  find that,  in  fact,  our deficits havebeen larger  than either  the  Congress or  the Administration now believethey will  be.  For the  short  term,  the  news will  be  great.  We will12/17/96-30-have  a fiscal  deal,  but  in  fact,  we will not  have solved our budgetproblems.  The bond market will  think  that we have and will  help fuelirrational  exuberance.I think  the  second bit  of  fuel  for  irrational  exuberanceduring 1997  is  going  to  be  the  credit  situation.  I noticed  thattoday's  Wall  Street  Journal was  carrying  a  story  that  the  nextCongress was going  to  be considering  bankruptcy reform.  I can thinkof  few worse  ideas,  frankly.  First  are  the politics  that  areinvolved.  Here we  have  a group of  bankers  saying  that  Congress has  totighten up  on bankruptcies,  and on  the  other  side we have  bankruptpeople,  some  of  whom have  sick  children,  some  of whom were unemployedfor  very good reason, and  some  of  whom have  gone  through divorces,although they  do not  generate enough  sympathy to  serve  on  the  panel.If  we have  to  satisfy those  two  constituencies and we  open up  thebankruptcy  laws,  those  laws  will  only get  worse.  Unfortunately, thereason I think the  exuberance will  be  irrational  is  that  the  lendershave now switched  from  saying  that  they  were not making  a mistakelending  to  these  people because  their models were  so  sophisticated  tonow saying  the problem  is  that  the bankruptcy  laws  are too  easy.  Ifwe actually ask  lenders  what  they are doing, we  find  that  they areturning around and making  loans  to  people who  just declaredbankruptcy.  The  easiest  solution  to  this  problem in my mind is  forbanks  and  other lenders  just  to  say  they will not  lend  to  anyone whohas  declared bankruptcy within  the past  three years.  The  lenders  arenot  ready  to  do  that.  Instead,  they are going  to  push for  newbankruptcy laws.  That  will  create  the  illusion  that  something  isbeing done when  that  really is  not  the  case.  So,  I think we  haveprobably another year to  go  on  the  excessive  credit  expansion.The  third bear is  going to  be  the  dollar.  I think Ted Trumanhas  underestimated how much the dollar  is  going  to  appreciate thisyear.  In both Japan and Europe,  there  is  now one clear recipe  forgetting out  of  their  mess.  That  is  export  growth,  and there  is  onlyone place  to  export  to  and  that  is  the  United States.  The way toincrease  exports  quickly is  to  devalue.  The  Japanese,  I am  told,Europeans  are  now deciding whether it  is  better  to  devalue before orafter  convergence.  I think in  the  end,  they will  go  for  it  before.That  is  going to be  good news,  and it  is  going  to  feed irrationalexuberance  in this  country as  well  because  it  is  going  to  keepinflation artificially low  for  a little while  longer.  We  are  going tobe  able  to  continue  to  sustain demand  in  the  context  of  downward pricepressures  on domestic  producers  because  of  relatively cheaper  imports.All  in  all,  I think  there will  be  good news  in  1997  on  thefiscal  front,  the  credit  front,  and  the  international  front.  But  ineach  case  it  is  going  to  be creating bigger problems  for  us  to  solvedown the  road.  So,  1998  looks  like  the year  in  which  irrationalexuberance will meet  its  match.

Thelimited new data  that  are  available  since  our  last  meeting support  thestaff's  prediction  that  the  lull  in  consumer  spending over  the  summerwas  likely a  temporary aberration and not  the  onset  of  any period ofsignificant retrenchment  due to  tightening consumer credit  orescalating debt  burdens.  Indeed, I have been fighting  the  crowds andsearching  in  frustration  for parking  spots  at  local  malls  in  recentdays  only, I assure you,  to  provide some  firsthand  independentresearch concerning the  strength of  Christmas  spending.  [Laughter]Frankly, my concern with  the possibility that  consumer  spending may betoo  robust rather  than  too weak has  increased.  At  a minimum, therisks with respect  to  consumption now  seem to me  to  be  quite balanced.However,  moderation  in government  spending and  residential  investmentcombined with the  significant drag  from net  exports--and that  drag hasbeen revised upward  in the  latest Greenbook  due  to  the  stronger  dollaras  Ted Truman mentioned--those  sources  of  drag,  I think,  should  offsetabove-trend  growth  in  consumption  and  investment  spending  over  theforecast  period.  If we  add to  that  the  fact  that  inventories  areseemingly  at  reasonable  levels  in  relation  to  sales,  the Greenbookforecast of  overall  growth  in demand seems  perfectly plausible withthe  risks  looking  quite balanced, as  Governor Meyer  stated  a minuteago.  Meanwhile,  the news  on  the  inflation  front  does  suggestcontinued moderation  in  core  inflation, with relief  on  the horizonmost  likely with respect  to  energy prices.To my mind,  labor markets  are  undeniably  tight.  You  remarkedlast  time, Mr.  Chairman,  that  we  should be  careful not  to  lullourselves  into  a  false  sense  of  security about  incipient  wagepressures by reading  too much  into  that  suspiciously low  third-quarterECI,  and I agree with that.  So,  I still  feel  that  we  need to  avoidcomplacency about  the potential  for  inflationary pressures  to  emergefrom  the  labor market  down the  road.  But while I  think we  cannot  ruleout  the possibility  that  this  long  expansion  is  about to  end with  aperiod  of  stagflation  and  that  that  is  a  significant  risk over  theterm of  this  forecast,  that  outcome  is  by no means  a  certainty.Capacity utilization, as  a number of  you  have mentioned,  is  notstrained at  this  point.  Incoming data  do  suggest  that  earnings  andprofitability remain  strong,  so  I do  not  see any  squeeze  on  corporateprofits  at  this  stage.  In  fact,  this  stunning combination  of  strongcorporate profits,  a healthy but  sustainable pace of  real  growth,  lowand maybe  even declining  inflation,  and  lower  real  interest  rates  dueto  enhanced prospects  of  a balanced budget  is  a mix  that may  indeedcontinue  to  support  a  level  of  stock prices  that  the  Greenbook--Iliked the  staff's  term  for  this--called  aggressive.  I thought,  ifanything, that  that was  an  accurate  statement and, given  the  carefulanalysis done here  at  the Board,  that  it  was perhaps  anunderstatement.  Like  Governor Lindsey and  some  of  the  rest of  you,  Iconsider  the  stock market a  significant continuing risk  to  theoutlook.  So,  I do worry that  this  confluence  of  favorable events  hasfostered what you  describe, Mr. Chairman--I  think appropriately--asirrational  exuberance  in  asset  markets.  I think your recent  remarksalluding to  the potential  for  large  asset price movements  that  arelikely to  have  adverse  impacts  on  economic activity wasextraordinarily useful  in prompting at  least  some  introspection andsome second  thoughts  by market participants  about  the  rationalityunderlying  the current  evaluation of  equity prices.  Maybe  your speechalso  served  to  heighten just  a  little  the  appreciation by the market12/17/96-32-that  there do  remain real  risks  around what  is  admittedly a very rosyforecast.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I was  wondering if  applause  is  inorder.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The Vice  Chairman  is  suggesting applausebut  don't.  [Laughter]If  there  are no  questions,  let me  get  started  on policy  andthe  directive.  As  many of  you have  mentioned, no  really  significantchanges  have  occurred  since  the  last  meeting.  The numbers  go  up  anddown, all  sorts  of  adjustments  take  place, and  one can  easily getmesmerized by small  changes,  but  the  evidence  suggests  that  there  justhas  not been much  change  in  the  economy since  our  last  meeting.  Ibelieve  it  is  correct  to  say that  the  expansion  is moving  along at  areasonably good pace;  its  underpinnings  are  fairly  solid.  There  is  nocredible  evidence  of  cumulative deterioration.  Goldilocks may not bethe  type  of  story  that  Governor Lindsey  feels  appropriate  for hischildren, but  the principle of  Goldilocks probably will  live  on  for  atleast  a short  period of  time,  though  my  fear  is  that  her  locks  aregoing  to  get  clipped at  some  point  reasonably  soon.Personal  consumption expenditures appear  to be  running  at  amoderate pace.  The Christmas  data  are always  very difficult  to  read.I would suggest  to  Governor Yellen that  her survey has  a problem  inthat  there are  five  fewer  shopping days  than usual  before  Christmas--

MS. YELLEN.  I forgot  that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  --so  there  are more cars per squareminute  [laughter]  than we normally would expect.  Nonetheless,  as  MikePrell points  out,  the weekly  seasonally adjusted data on  chain  storesales  do show  some  significant  strength.  I presume  that  our X-llseasonal  adjustment  program is  not mesmerized by the  shorter  sellingseason  phenomenon.I thought  that,  to  date, the  slightly disappointing Decembermotor vehicle  sales  number was perhaps  just  as  important  as  thesomewhat  firmer  Christmas  season  sales  in the  usual GAF  goodscategories.  Given  shortfalls  in  the  last  month or  two  in motorvehicle  sales  owing to  the  strike,  one would have  expected  these datato  start  coming back  this  month.  But,  to  date,  the  surveys  that  MikeMoskow  has made  and  that  we are making  ourselves  do not  show anysignificant  improvement  in  motor vehicle sales.  It  is  conceivable,since  we  are  only  halfway through  the  month, that  we could get  a  lot12/17/96-33-of  action  over  the  rest  of  the month  in  both  regular  Christmas buyingand motor vehicle  sales.  I would say  that  for  the moment  it  is  notself-evident  that  we will  have  very strong  growth  in personalconsumption  expenditures  in  the  fourth quarter, but  clearly growthwill be  markedly above  the pace  in  the  third quarter.  I  thinkconsumer  spending  in  that  quarter was  artificially reduced, in part byDepartment  of  Commerce adjustments  for  the hurricane  and that  sort  ofthing.One  interesting  aspect  of  consumer markets  can  be  seen  from adisaggregation we  have made  of  consumer  credit  into  gross  extensions,repayments,  and net change,  the  latter being our published number.This  statistical  construction has  much  the same  form as  was  used anumber of  years  ago  in publishing  installment credit  extensions  andrepayments.  What  it  shows  is  a very significant  increase  in  the  lastyear  or  two  in  the ratio  of nonautomotive  gross  extensions  tononautomotive  retail  sales.  That was  the  case until  the  last  coupleof  observations,  for  October and November, when  all  of  a sudden  itlooked as  though consumer  credit had hit  a ceiling.  After rising  likethis,  it  went  flat.  This  is  consistent  with the  general  notion  thatconsumers as  a group may be running up  against  some  credit  limit.To  test  this  hypothesis,  I asked  the  staff  to  try to  use ourSurvey of  Consumer  Finances,  which we  conduct  every  three  years,  inconjunction with the  data on  income quintiles  and  the  flow-of-fundsaggregates  to  estimate  the  different  types  of  household assets  byincome groups.  Those  statistics were  employed to  make judgments  as  tohow the  household balance  sheet  would look on  a disaggregated basis  aswe moved well  into  1996.  Granted  that  there  is  a lot  of weakness  inall  of  these  data,  there  is  a certain  robustness  to  the result  becausewe  do have,  in  addition to  income,  controlling aggregates  of  consumercredit  and  stock market  wealth  including  equity mutual  funds.  Eventhough  a  lot  of  statistical manipulations  are  involved, the  robustnessof  the  results  is  really quite  remarkable when we  have  very strongtrends.  The  numbers  that we  endeavor  to  adjust  in  a matrix  withcontrolled  rows  and columns  and nonnegative  components  are  constrainedby algebra.  The matrix  algebra  severely  limits  how much  leeway wehave  in the  various  cells,  provided  they are  all  nonnegative  or  zero,which they are.The  end result  of  all  of  this  confirms  the  fact  thatconsumers  at  the  lower  end of  the  income  distribution indeed  have moresignificant consumer debts  than  equity assets,  which  are  the  two  bigsurging  items  that  have  been moving  household balance  sheets  of  late.This  is  consistent with  the notion of  some  constraint  on consumerspending,  although  the detail  that  we have  and  the  limited breakdownof  only five  quintiles  are not  in  and of  themselves all  that  conclu-sive.  All  one  can say  is  that  there are  not  enough  assets,  specifi-cally  equity assets,  on  the  balance  sheets  of  those with  constrainingconsumer debt  to  overwhelm  the  debt  argument.  That  is,  the datasuggest  that  there  is  a  fairly  large number  of  individual householdsthat have  a lot  of  consumer  debt  and very little  equity assets  orindeed much of anything  else.  This,  in  a  sense,  confirms  the  factthat  there  is  some  debt  limit  against  which we  are running,  althoughone can argue  it  is  not  all  that  much of  a constraint.  It  is  aconstraint against  an  acceleration  in  spending but  clearly not  onethat  suggests  a pulling back.  It  may well  be part  of  the  explanationas  to  why the wealth effect  on  consumer  spending  seems  to  be  falling12/17/96-34-somewhat  short  of  econometric  estimates  that  we  obtain  from  theaggregate  data when we  try  to  filter  out  the  impact  of  changes  in  thevalue of  equity market holdings  on personal  consumption  expenditures.I hope  to be  able  to  get  something more  out  of  this  data  system, butit  is  hard  to  know because a  lot  of  guesswork  is  going into  ourequations,  and we  are  not  quite  sure whether what we  are getting  outis  the  guesswork we  put  in!  [Laughter]On  the residential building  issue,  a quick appraisal  of  thesharp rise  in starts  reported  this  morning suggests  that  it  is  goingto  be partly retraced  in  December.  The reason  is  that  the  best  short-term  forecasting  system  that  I have seen  on housing  starts  is  one  thattries  to  track  the pace of  net permits  through  to  the  starts  figures.the  level  of  net permits,  meaning permits  adjusted  to  the  level  ofstarts  less  cancellations,  is  significantly below the  current  level  ofstarts whereas  they were  above  in  October.  One  of  the  ways  of  lookingat  the  November figure  is  in  terms  of  the  pipeline  effect, which  is  infact  the  question  that  Jerry Jordan was  raising.  There  is  someevidence  that what  is  in  the pipeline  at  this  stage  is well  under  thelevel  of  single-family  starts.  My  guess  is  that  we will  get  someretrenchment.  Indeed,  whenever  the  permits  backlog declines,  theprobability of a retrenchment  in  starts  the  next month  is  a good dealbetter  than  50/50.  Having said  that,  all  the  other  evidence,including  that  sharp  rise  in mortgage  loan  applications  for  the weekended December  6 shown  in  the  mortgage  bankers' weekly  release, hasbeen  rather  startling.  I do not  know whether I should believe  theseasonal,  but  if  one  looks  at  the  data,  it  goes  like  this  and  thenthere  is  a  spike.  Usually  that  means  that  something  is  happening eventhough  it may be  exaggerated  in  the  data.  So,  I  think there  is  goodevidence  that  while December  starts may be  down,  the  residential  realestate market  is  probably  in  the process  of  stabilizing.The  inventory data, as  a number  of  you have mentioned,  arereally quite  benign, and  it  is  hard  to  find any  significant  changes  ininventory  investment  in  either  direction.  The October  figures  inconstant dollars  were  running  at  the pace  of  the  third  quarter.  Thereis  no  reason to believe  that  anything  of  great  significance is  goingto  occur.  The  only point  that  may be  worth making  is  that  there  weresomewhat  more  imported  inventories  implicit  in  the  third-quarter datathan  is  normal,  so  it  may be  that  the  size  of  the  adjustment  if we  goto  a  slower  inventory  investment  level will  be  somewhat  less.  The  onecaveat  there  is  that  theoretically one  should  see  those  importedinventories  reflected  on  the  import  side  of  the GDP  accounts.  As  hardas  Ted Truman's  people  have worked  on  finding it,  it  is  not  there,which  I would guess  is  a  statistical discrepancy rather  than  reality.But  no matter how one  cuts  it,  there does  not  seem to  be  anything ofimportance  in the  inventory data.Wages  do appear  to be  accelerating very modestly, but  let mecaution you on  the  .8 percent  increase in  the November  figure  foraverage hourly earnings.  The  fixed-weight numbers  are  lower;  thefixed-weight  plus adjustment  for  the  overtime number  that we  calculatebrings  the  increase down  to  about  .4 percent  from  .8 percent.Nonetheless,  even with all  of  these  adjustments,  we are  still  gettinga mild degree  of  acceleration, which has  not ceased.  As  a consequenceof  that,  I have also  asked the  staff  to  work a  little more  on  gettinga better  sense  numerically of  this  tradeoff  question between job12/17/96-35-security and wage  gains.  At  my suggestion,  they put  together a veryinteresting model  that provides clear  evidence that  the  trend of  jobleavers has been very  flat  in  the  context  of  a falling unemploymentrate.  At  least historically,  that  is  not  the  way labor markets  aresupposed to  function.  The  staff  has very cleverly been  able  toextract  the average duration of  unemployment  for  job leaversconsistent with  that overall  statistic.  One would presume, and indeedthe  data  do  show, that  the number  of  job leavers  is  a function of  theaverage period  of unemployment--that  is,  a proxy for  the  cost  ofbecoming unemployed.  The  longer  the  duration is,  the  greater thepossibility that becoming unemployed  is  going  to be  very costly to  aworker, and hence the  worker will  be  increasingly disinclined toleave.  These data  do  in  fact,  with one caveat,  suggest  that  a goodlypart  of  the  shortfall  in  the  ability of  our  regular wage  equation toproject what actually has been happening is  correlated with thisstatistic.  The  caveat  is  that,  as you  all  know, we had adiscontinuity in  the household series  as  of  January 1994,  and the  jobleaver series has  gone  a little  off  kilter.  I am not  sure  it  meansall  that much, but until we ascertain  that  the  discontinuity is  notcreating a lot  of  this correlation  with the  residuals  from  ourPhillips wage  equations,  it  would not be  that convincing  to use  thistype  of model  as  a numerical measure of  the  job  insecurity/wage  gaintradeoff.I might  add that  the  type  of  residuals  that we are  talkingabout,  if  translated  into  a system in which everything is  exactly ontrack but where  the NAIRU  is  the  residual  unknown variable, wouldimply  a NAIRU well  under  5 percent  to  bring all  this  together.  So,  weare  getting  a gradual increase  in  labor  costs  in  a data  system  that  isexplaining a phenomenon known in principle  to  be  transitional.  Theonly issue  is when  the  transition period will  end and we will  get  anormal  reacceleration of  wages  at  lower unemployment levels  than  theyhave been historically but where the  rate  of  change  in wages  and  itseffect  on prices revert  to  historical patterns.Remember  that  this  wage shortfall  also mirrors  the  opening upof  operating profits.  What  one must  assume  about  all  of  this  is  thatwe are getting  such a benign price pattern  in this  environment becausethese very  large  operating margins  are  creating a rate  of  return onequity that is  higher  than normal.  This  is  another way of  sayingthat,  if  any competitor  tries  to  move prices up  in  that  environment,the profit margins  of  other  competitors  are  such as  to  enable  them tocompete  at  a lower price  and still  be  above  their hurdle  rate  ofreturn on  equity.  We  do not  have  to  bring into  the  equation all  sortsof  noneconomic  forces  to  explain  these price phenomena.  It  is  the  oldbasic  rate of  return on  capital  that  is  keeping  the  cap  on  the pricelevel.  What  is  keeping the  return on  capital up  is  the  subnormal  rateof  wage  increases.  When  one element goes,  the whole  thing starts  tounravel.  There  is  no  evidence  at  this  stage  that  that  is  occurring,but  it  is going  to  happen at  some point.  When it  happens,  we aregoing  to  find that  we are  back on  the  old track.I guess  the key question is  the  same  issue  that we raisedlast  time.  Will  the economy  soften sufficiently quickly to  take  thepressure off  the wage  structure before  the  transition occurs?  I wouldsay at  this  stage  that  there  is  as  yet no  evidence  to  suggest any suchsoftening:  Order patterns  still  look reasonably solid;  the  levels  ofconsumer confidence  are beyond  belief  at  this  stage;  there  are  very12/17/96-36-few  imbalances  of  the  kind  that  usually have  led  to problemshistorically;  profit  margins  apparently have  flattened out,  but  theysurely have not  turned down.  As  a  consequence, we  are  still  facedwith pressures  in  the  labor  market  such  that,  if  the  latter  everreverts  to  a normal pattern,  a whole  new set  of  inflationary forceswill  be created.  Therefore, while  I think we can  stay at  "B"  for  awhile  as  we assess  whether  diminished demand pressures  in  the  economywill  reduce  pressures  in  the  labor markets before  this  transitionalprocess  is  over,  I believe  we confront  a far  greater  likelihood  thatthe next  move will be  up  rather  than down.  So,  I would hope  that  wecan  stay asymmetric  today  and still  remain at  "B."  Vice  Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr.  Chairman,  for  all  the  reasonsyou  suggested, I believe that  maintaining official  interest  rates  attheir  present  levels  is  appropriate  and therefore  "B" is  appropriate.I agree  that  it  is  very  likely that  our next  move will be up  and  thatasymmetry  should be used to  indicate  that  there  is  a strong  consensusamong Committee  members  that  the  risks  to  the  forecast  are  on the  upside.  That  is  how  I would interpret  asymmetry rather  than  asreflecting a high  likelihood that  we would move  to  change  ratesbetween  now and  into  the  new year.  So,  I believe  "B" asymmetric  isclearly the  right  conclusion  for  today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I accept  your definition  of  asymmetry.Governor  Rivlin.

[SECTION]

MS.  RIVLIN.  I agree  and especially with the Vice  Chair'sformulation of  it.  I do not  see  any  reason  for a move at  the moment.We  are  doing  fine,  but  the  risks are  clearly on  the up  side,  thoughthey may be less  so  than we  thought  when we  launched  into  theasymmetric pattern.  They are  not  enough  less  to  convince  me that weshould revert  to  symmetry, although  I must  say that  I find  the meaningof  these  asymmetries  a  little mysterious.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr. Chairman,  our  forecast suggests  that  it  maybe necessary  sometime next  year  to  tighten the  stance of policy  toimpart  some  downward momentum  to the  underlying  rate  of  inflation.However,  there would  seem  to be  little  or no  reason  to  take  actionnow.  At  our Bank,  we  consult  two monetary policy rules  as  a  startingpoint  for  thinking about  the  appropriate stance  of  policy:  anestimated version  of  Taylor's  rule and  a nominal  income growth raterule.  Even if  we assume  a 2 percent  target  for  core CPI  inflation,both rules  suggest  that  the  funds rate  should be  left  at  about  5-1/4percent at  the  present  time,  although when applied to  our  forecastthey do  suggest higher rates  will  be needed  in  the  future.  Inaddition,  it  appears  to  us  at  least  that  there  is  considerableuncertainty at  this  time  about  the prospective  strength of  economicactivity.  Therefore,  I support  the Bluebook  alternative  B, with a5-1/4  percent  funds  rate and asymmetric  language  on the  side  oftightening.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman,  as  I said  earlier  I think  therisks  are more balanced now.  Because  of  that  I do not believe  theneed  to  tighten  our  short-term policy stance  is  as  urgent  as  it  wasearlier and I would accept  your recommendation,  although if  you hadrecommended a  slight  snugging, my opposition would have been  less  thanheated.  [Laughter]I would  like  to make  one  other quick comment  that  is  verymuch in  the  spirit  of what  Tom Melzer  and Jerry Jordan  said during  theeconomic  go-around.  Our next  meeting is  a Humphrey-Hawkins meetingwhere we  once  again have  an opportunity  to  look  at  our  longer-termstrategy.  I hope we will  take  that  oppportunity to  sharpen  ourstrategy perhaps  a little  and communicate  it  even more concretely  thanwe have.  This,  it  seems  to me,  is  an appropriate  time  to  do  thatsince,  with  the Boskin  Committee report,  there  now is  an  emergingconsensus  on  the  magnitude of  the bias  in  the  CPI.  It  has  alwaysstruck me as  a  little  ironic or  at  least  curious  that  at  theseHumphrey-Hawkins  meetings we all  submit  a forecast  for  inflation  forone  year  out  and  then just  stop  there.  Obviously,  the Fed  can controlthe  inflation rate over  a reasonable  time period, so  we cannot  helpbut  ask ourselves why we do  not just  set  out  a multiyear  path  to  fullprice  stability  that  we expect  to  follow  over  some sensible  timeperiod, state  it  publicly, and then pursue  it.  Or  at  a minimum alongthe  lines  of  Tom Melzer's  comment  earlier,  we could  state  explicitlythat we will  not  tolerate  a backup  in  the  inflation rate  to  a  levelover  3 percent.  If  I am  not mistaken, we briefly discussed thepossibility of  doing  something  like  that  at  our last  Humphrey-Hawkinsmeeting, and  I would hope  that  we would  consider  it  again at  the nextmeeting in  February.  I think this  is  the  time  to  do  it  while  thecurrent  inflation rate  is  relatively  low.  If  we  lock  in  the  currentlylow level  of  the  inflation rate,  I think  that will  position us  to makesome  further progress  on  the  expectations  side, which  seems  to  me tobe  the  big  thing now.

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  I am in  full  agreement with yourrecommendation  for  "B" asymmetric.  I also  believe  that  Vice ChairmanMcDonough's definition  of  the various  aspects  of  symmetry  is  quite  inline with mine.  I think  that  our  indicating  symmetry or  asymmetry  inour directive really  does  communicate  the  direction  to  our thinkingand does  not  have  any  impact  on what  the process  will be  in  terms  ofhow that will  be  implemented.  I would like  to  see  that  understood byeverybody because  the  notion of  symmetry in  our directive  isconfusing.  I think we  can make  it  less  so.

MR. BOEHNE.  I support  your  recommendation.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR.  MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  This  is  for  Ed Boehne  and  others.I do not want  them to  get  too  nervous  about Al  Broaddus  and me both"selling out"  on  an  earlier view.  CPI  inflation  is  up  1/2  percentagepoint  this  year over  last  year, and  I think  the  risks  are  that  itcould rise  further.  Personally, as  I view the  incoming informationand  listen  to  the  comments  today,  I see  the  risks  of  rising  inflationas  somewhat greater  now than  they were at  the  time  of  the  lastmeeting, not  less.  So,  I would  favor a modest  increase  in  the  degreeof reserve  restraint.Now, such  an  increase  clearly would  catch markets  off  guardand  if  we acted, which  of course  is  not going  to  happen  today, wewould have  to  put  that  action  in  the  context  of  a  long-run  inflationobjective.  At  this  stage  I would put  it  in  the  context  of  trying  tocap  inflation at  3 percent.  In  some sense we  should not have  toexplain  that.  I think markets  should have  a better  idea  of  what  ourobjectives  are.  The  fact  that  we  have  not been more  explicit  aboutour  objectives, I  think,  is probably  the  most  significant  risk to  ourindependence  in  comparison  to  other  things we worry about.  I think weare  perceived to  have  much more  influence  than we really do,  and wecould deflect  that  perception  if  we  explained  that what we are  reallyfocused  on  is  the  inflation rate  in  the  long  run and  that  is  all  weinfluence.So,  I would support what  Al  has  said here with respect  to  adiscussion in  February.  We  really need  to  zero  in on  this  issue  andbe more  explicit about  our  long-term  intentions  with respect  toinflation.  Personally, as  I think you all know,  I would be  in  favorof  laying out  a path  like Al  described, but whatever  we can get  interms  of  being  more explicit would be better  than  the  situation  thatwe are  in now.  I do  not  think we  can wait  for  legislative resultsthat  might  clarify that.  I think we have  a job to  do  to  educate  thepublic  about  what  our  intentions are,  and  a good starting point  is  bybeing more  explicit  about our objectives.  Setting  our  inflationobjectives  is  something we would have  to  ease  into,  but  I think  thatit  is  very  important.  I would like  to  encourage  a discussion  inpossibilities  with respect  to  things we might  do  that  would take  us  inthat  direction.

MS.  PHILLIPS.  I also  support  "B" asymmetric  in view of  therenewed  strength of  the  economy  in  the current  quarter.  It  seems  tome  that  the  balance  of  risks has  shifted  to  the  up side,  implying thenecessity of  vigilance  on  inflation developments.

MS.  YELLEN.  I support  your recommendation.  I see policy asappropriately positioned now and agree  with  President Parry  that  thatbecomes  apparent  from  the  observation  of rules  or  from  the  Greenbookforecast.  But  to my mind the  risks  are asymmetric.  I appreciate  theclarification  of  the meaning  of  that  term,  and with  that  clarificationI certainly am happy to  support continued  asymmetry today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  I agree with  the  recommendation  to  leave  thefunds rate  unchanged at  this meeting,  but  I am  troubled by  this  issueof  the meaning of  asymmetry,  not  only among  ourselves but  also what wecommunicate  to  others.  In  one  sense,  a central  bank should  always beasymmetric  toward  firming with regard  to  the  issue  of  inflation.  Inanother sense,  I cannot  imagine  the  circumstances under  which therewould be  any new information  that  would cause  an action  in  the  nearterm--between now and  the  next  meeting.  So what  asymmetry means  isthat  if  the  consensus  of  this  group  is  that  the next  action  is  morelikely up  than  down,  it  is  because  of  rising  inflation well  out  therein  the  future,  given  the  long and variable  lags  that  exist.  In myview, we  have  done  a much better  job  recently of  avoidingcommunicating  that we  are  concerned  as  such  about  too much  growth  ortoo many people working or not  enough unemployed people  and other  idleresources.  We  do not want  to  fall  back into  those kinds  ofcommunications.  So,  how are  we going  to  communicate  the need  to  movethe  funds  rate up  when we  face  it,  because  of  our  concern  aboutinflation in  1998  and beyond,  if  we  do  not  set  out  explicit multiyearobjectives  and  couch any action  we have  to  take  in  that  context?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  I support  your  recommendation.  I was  justthinking about  what  Jerry Jordan  said.  I like  the  line--I  am  sorry  Iforgot  who said  it--that nervous  reactiveness may be  the  best we  canhope  for.  When we  look at  the  loss  function and  the  amount  ofuncertainty  out  there,  I think prompt  action when we  first  get  asignal  in  this  environment  is  a reasonable  conclusion.  I would saythat  that  is  very much  along  the  lines  of  an  asymmetric  directive.  Icould  imagine  asymmetry going  the  other way as well;  in  fact,  we wereasymmetric  going  the other way  through much  of  1991  and  1992.  So,  Ithink it  is  the  right  recommendation and that  it  is  consistent withthe way President McDonough  defined  it.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Finally, Governor Meyer.

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr.  Chairman, I support your  recommendation.  Asthe  risks have  become more balanced  over  the  last  few months,  it  hasclearly become  a  closer call  as  to  whether  the  directive  should besymmetric  or asymmetric.  Nevertheless,  the  major  risk seems  to be  a12/17/96-40-rise  in  the  inflation  rate  and I  therefore concur  with that  asymmetricdirective.Let  me  just preview our next  discussion  since we  seem  to  befocusing  in  advance  on  the  February meeting and  the potentialdiscussion of  longer-term  targets  and  strategies.  I would certainlyrespond well  to  some notion  of  a cap  like  3 percent  on  inflation, butI am going  to be very  troubled  from my opportunistic  perspective  aboutlaying  out  a  specific year-to-year path.  I would not want  to  feelcommitted to  a  specific path.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  The consensus  appears  to  be"B" asymmetric.  Would you  read the  directive  that  would accomplishthat?

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  It  is  on page  13  of  the Bluebook:  "In  theimplementation of  policy for  the  immediate  future,  the Committee  seeksto maintain  the  existing degree  of  pressure  on reserve  positions.  Inthe  context  of  the  Committee's  long-run objectives  for price  stabilityand  sustainable economic  growth,  and giving  careful  consideration toeconomic,  financial,  and monetary  developments,  somewhat  greaterreserve  restraint would or  slightly lesser  reserve  restraint  might beacceptable  in  the  intermeeting period.  The contemplated  reserveconditions  are  expected to  be  consistent  with relatively  strongexpansion  in M2  and M3  over  coming months."
