CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Good morning, everyone.  Regrettably,this  is  Bob Forrestal's  last  outing.  I would be  inclined  to  give  himfive  or six  votes  for  this  meeting, but  I don't  think  thatauthorization  is  statutorily available.  But  spiritually we  would liketo  do  so.  We'll  be  saying more to  Bob  at  lunch,  and we  look  forwardto  seeing him  there.  In  the  interim, would somebody like  to moveapproval  of  the  minutes  of  the  meeting on  September 26?

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  So  move.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  Peter  Fisher, youhave  the  floor  for  a while.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  As  you  can see  on  the agenda  andalso on  an outline  of  my remarks  that  has  been circulated with  someattached charts,  I am  going to  take  up  four  topics  separately.  I willbe  asking  for  the  Committee's questions  and relevant vote  at  the  endof  each of  the  first  three  topics  so  that  we  can  get  through  thisrather meaty portion of  the  agenda  in  an  orderly  fashion.  I will  turnfirst  to  the  report  on  foreign  exchange market  developments  and  Deskoperations.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?  I guess  yourreport  sounded pretty  complete as  anticipated.  Why  don't you  go  on?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The  Committee needs  to  ratify  the Mexican swaprenewal.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The Mexicans paid down part  of  their  swap  linedrawings,  and I rolled  over  the  remaining portion on October  30  forthe  third  time.  I am requesting Committee  ratification.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  Committee will  remember that we willbe  covered either  by Mexico  or  the U.S.  Treasury--by February, Ibelieve.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  at  the  end of  January.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So,  this  is  a relatively safe  activityunless,  of  course,  you know who  or  what doesn't  pay!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  has  been moved.  Is  it  seconded?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All  in  favor  say  "aye."

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  "Aye."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  "ayes" have  it.  Peter,  continue.11/15/95

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  [Statement  continued--see Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for  Peter?

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  I just  want  to  get  something  clear.  Do  any  ofthese  reciprocal  arrangements  with other central  banks potentiallyinvolve  warehousing funds  for  the  Treasury,  should  the Treasury wantto  engage  in  foreign  exchange transactions?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No,  I don't  see  how.  At  the very bottom  of  thelist  of  our swap  lines  that  I have  given you,  you can  see  that  theTreasury has  two  swap  lines  of  its  own with Mexico  and the  Bundesbank.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  They are  separate.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  They are  entirely separate.  So,  I cannot  seeany way that  a drawing  on  the System  swap  lines would have anynecessary connection with System warehousing  for  the  Treasury.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further  questions  for  Peter?  If  not,  isthere  a motion  to  renew the swap  agreements  that  mature  in  December?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So  move.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Second?

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  "Aye."

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The  "ayes"  have  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Thank you.  Before  turning  to my  report  on  thedomestic  markets  and operations,  I would  like  to  give  the Committee  abit more background on  the Desk's  cooperation with  the  Japanesemonetary  authorities  in  managing the  liquidity  of  their portfolio  ofU.S.  government  securities  as  part of  their broader effort  to  aid  thedollar  liquidity of  the  Japanese  banks.  [Statement  continued--seeAppendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  is  the  market  saying  now, ifanything, about  a possible  spike  in  the  funds  rate  at  year-end?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  A  spike  in  year-end  rates  is  always  there.  Idon't  think  it's  out  of  line with--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  The market  has  built  in a  spike  of  about  1 or  2percentage points  as  best we  can  guess.  We have  to make  an  assumptionabout  what  the  market  is  thinking  the  federal  funds  rate will  be  andthen  subtract  that  to  estimate  the  spike.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  But  it's  entirely in  line  with the  normal  end-of-year pressures.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Yes.  If  anything  it  may be  a little  less.11/15/95

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So,  you can't  really  disassociate ouractions  from  the  spike.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right.  It's  a highly conditional  forecast.  But,if  anything,  it  appears  that  the  markets are  expecting slightly  lessof  a  spike  at year-end  this year than  they have at  this  point  inrecent  years.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  But  the problem there,  just  to  go  into  detail,is  that  we  have  to  look  at  the  futures  contract  for December,  takeaccount  of  the  limited probability of  a  Committee action to  ease  innormally does  some  smoothing  in  its  pricing of  the  futures  contracts.If  there  is  an assumption  of  an aggressive  easing  in policy threemonths  out,  the  end contracts  tend  to  edge  down a little  and  toprovide  a bit  of  trend line  toward  that  lower  funds  rate.  That makesit  hard  to  judge  futures prices.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I assume  that  to  a  large  extent  theJapanese  have been a  factor  in the  year-end spike  over  the years.Does  that  propensity exist  in  other currencies where  the Japanese areheavily  involved?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  In  some degree,  it  has occurred  in the  yen

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The year-end spike?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well,  their  fiscal  year-end  is  March 31st,  andthere  is  some pressure  in  their funds  market  then.  There areoccasions when the  deutschemark money market  experiences  rather  sharpspikes.  These  stem both  from the  German banking  system and  fromforeign demand of  which  the Japanese may be  a part,  but  I don't  thinkquite as  significant a part  as  in  our market.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That  is  a year-end, December 31st  spike?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can we  infer what  the market  forces  areabstracting  from our  actions  by looking  at  the potential  spikecharacteristics  in other  currencies where  Japanese banks  areoperating, like  in  London?

[SECTION]

MR.  TRUMAN.  That would be  a  little difficult.  One of  theproblems  is  that  two  things  are  going on with Japanese banks  at  thispoint.  One  is  the  Japanese year-end premium.  The  other  is  thegeneral  Japanese  risk premium.  I think  it's  a  little difficult,  forsome  of  the  reasons  that  Peter  just  pointed out with respect  to  thefunds  futures,  to  separate  which of  the  two you  are dealing with.  Youcan make  an  assumption, such  as  attributing  it  all  to  the year-endpressures,  but there  is  some  leakage  in  this  process.  And you have  aphenomenon that  whatever  the  pressures  are,  they  are in both  the yenof  it  is.  There may be  a  little  in  the  sterling markets.11/15/95

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  I don't want  to  press  that;  Idon't  think it's  a big deal.  I am just  curious.  Other  questions  forPeter?  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  I have  a  couple  of questions.  On the  Japanesefunding  situation,  I know  that  all  this  planning is  being done  withinthe  normal  framework of  Desk operations.  I don't  know  about the  restof you, but  the headlines  in  The New York Times  about  this  specialfunding  arrangement hit me  as  a  surprise when  I read them  at  7:30  onemorning.  If  there  is  going to  be  a briefing  of  Congress,  I wonderwhether the  Committee also  could be  briefed.  It's  not  that  we aregoing  to  say anything necessarily;  it's  just  to make us  feel  a littlebit  in  the  loop when  these  things come  out  in  the press.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  My recollection  is  that we  thought  thearrangement was  so  routine  and so  inconsequential  that  it  did notenter anybody's  mind to  raise  it.  And,  indeed,  the way  it  came  outwas  so distorted that  I got  numerous  telephone  calls  as  a  result  of  acomment  by Ralph Nader on  the  radio  that  we were bailing  out  theJapanese and  that  his  listeners  should  call  the  Federal  Reserve  tocomplain.  When  I finally talked  to  Senator D'Amato, who  had raisedall  sorts  of  questions,  he  said he  wished he had  heard thatexplanation earlier.  It  would have  averted the  excessive  criticismthat  was voiced.  The problem existed because  there  was  a mis-communication between us  and Jim Leach;  he didn't  realize  that heshould not  talk about  this  because  that made  it  sound  like  a muchbigger deal  than  it  was.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Do we  have  these  informal  understandings  withother  central banks,  other  than the  Bank  of  Japan,  that  if  they runinto  dollar  or  liquidity problems  (a) their banks are not  to  come  tous  and  (b) there may be  some  way in which we  can,  within the  normalprocedures,  help  them with  their funding?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  answer  is  no.  Some  central  banks  realizethat  if  they are  talking  about  $500  million or  $1 billion,  they cansell  bills  to  the  Desk and we will  execute  such  transactions  for  themrelatively effectively.  There  are  some  less  subtle  or more  anxiouscentral  bankers  who approach  the  Desk to  ask if  we can  guarantee  thatwe will do  a  $5 billion repo with them  if  they  need some  liquiditysuddenly.  What  they want  to  avoid is  having  to  sell  the  securitiesoutright  and having  to  take  a gain  or a  loss.  We  explain to  themthat,  no,  we don't  provide  guarantees.  So,  the  question  frequentlycomes  up  conversationally  in  that  way.  As  I say, the  subtler  centralbankers  understand  that when  relatively  small  amounts  of Treasurysecurities  are  involved we  can help  them by either  selling  thesecurities  in  the market  or  taking  them  into  our portfolio.  Thelarger amounts  are  not  in  the nature  of  what  we  do  routinely and  thatwas  the  tenor of  our  conversations  with  the  Japanese when largeramounts  were  clearly what  they were  interested in.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  President Minehan,  I think  one dimension  of  thisthat  Peter  did  not  include  in his  report,  because he  gave  a  lot  ofbackground  and  the report  was  already long  enough,  is  that  there  is  aparticular  problem, which  I am  sure you will  appreciate,  in  terms  ofthe  payments  system.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Oh yes.11/15/95

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  We have  staff who  have worried about  thisgeneral  problem of  foreign-held dollars  in the payments  system  for  atleast  a decade  to my knowledge.  In  some  sense, because  of  the  size  ofthe  Japanese banks  and their  role  in  the  international  financialsystem,  they are  a particular problem and this  arrangement  orprocedure  is  designed to  deal  with that  problem.  One dimension wouldhave  almost a pure payments  system  set  of  consequences,  but  I think weall  recognize  that  it  is  a general  dollar payments problem  and that  itis  not unique  to  Japanese banks.  In principle,  U.S.  banks  could havethe  same  problem elsewhere.  Although  this  arrangement was  set  upbecause  of  the  current  situation with respect  to  the  Japanese banks,it  is  part  of  a general problem and I don't  think we  have  a standardset  of  procedures  to  deal  with  it.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I  totally agree  and  I certainly understand whatyou  are  talking about.  The  implication  that we would do  things  afterhours,  after  the  securities wire closes  and  all  of  that,  did  seem tome to  be  a move  that  it  would have  been  interesting at  least  to  knowabout.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  Certainly.  As  the  Chairman explained, it  gotpublicity when  it  was not  intended and  the  latter was  somewhatpremature  in  any  case.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  The  second question  that  I had was  on  the newprocedure  relating to  your operations  in  coupon  issues.  Peter,  is  ityour  intention over  this  three-  or  four-day period,  for however  longyou might  spread your  coupon pass,  to  pick certain portions  of  theyield curve  on  any given day as  opposed to  preselecting from a numberof points  on  the  yield curve?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.  We  would try to  choose  an area  of  theyield curve,  say,  the  two-  to  three-year  area  or  the  five-year area,define  it  for  the dealers,  and  then take propositions  only in  thatportion of  the  curve.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  And you  don't  think that  will  have  anydisruptive  effects  on  that  given day?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It  might  the  first  few times  that  we use  theprocedure.  But my hope  is  that  things  would smooth  out  over  time,  asthe dealers  got used to  it  and  they saw  that  we  are  like  any bigcustomer who might  come  along  and buy up  a certain maturity.  I alsowant  to  be  clear.  I don't  think we would necessarily be mechanicalabout day  one,  day two,  day  three,  day  four  and conduct  thesetransactions  on consecutive days.  We might  do  it  that  way;  we  mightbreak it  up  and have  a day fall  in  between depending on what otherthings  are  going  on--a bill  auction,  for  example.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Is  it  part  of  your plan  to  discuss  this  withmajor market participants  outside  of  New York?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  community to  talk  to  first  and  foremost isthe dealers,  wherever  they are  located,  since  they  are  the  ones  whohave  to  do  the  bidding and put  in  the  propositions.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.11/15/95

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Obviously, once we begin  it  we'll  have to  haveguidance  for  Peter Bakstansky  in  our press  office  and  figure out  whatwe  are going  to  say more generally  so  that  the  Fed-watching  communitydoesn't  jump  on  it  and misinterpret  it.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It might be useful  to  talk to  Fidelity amongothers.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  Peter, your description  of  the  arrangements withJapan and  the very unfortunate press  reports  and confusing  storiesrelating to  all  that  and now  this  discussion  following Cathy'squestion just  emphasizes  in my view how obsolete  swap agreements  arein  this  environment.  In  the  case where a  country has  very substantialamounts  of  dollar-denominated assets  that  they want  to  convert  intodollar balances,  frankly,  this  "ain't"  the mechanism to  use.  Swapswere  set up in  a period when we  needed to  get  access  to  some  foreigncurrencies  that  we did not have  or when our  foreign  central bankcounterparts  needed  to  get  access  to  dollars  that  they  did not  have.But  in  today's  world we  need a mechanism for  them to  be  able  toconvert  dollar-denominated assets  into dollar  balances.  I looked downyour  list  of  foreign central  banks  in  our  swap network and  I seefairly small  swap  lines:  Norway,  $250  million;  and Denmark,  $250million.  What  is  the probability  that  we would draw on  these  swaplines  or  that  they would be  in  a situation where  they needed to drawon  them  to  get  dollars?  If  I recall  correctly,with  the original  intent  of  the  swap  line network a central  bank wantsaccess  to  dollars  because  they don't  have any, we don't want  to  giveit  to  them.  Therefore, when and how  is  there  an  appropriate use  ofswap  agreements  today, holding  the Mexico  discussion  for a  latermeeting?So,  if  in keeping

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  You  are  raising  a good point.  I think we  havealways  thought  of  swaps  as  a bit  of  a hybrid.  Given our  focus  onhaving a short-term means  of  repayment, we have  tried to  think  of  theswap  lines,  or  I try  to  think of  them,  as merely a  liquidityarrangement with  a central  bank  like  the  Bundesbank, notwithstandingthe  fact  that  they hold a  lot  of  U.S. government  securities.Conceptually,  I think  the  swap line  can  still  be  used, but  obviouslyits  use  is  problematic given  our concern about  the  short-term means  ofrepayment  if  a borrower  really  runs  through  every asset  in  sight.  Inthe  episode  to  which you  refer,  there  certainly was  a  sense,  andrelated anxiety, on  our  part  that  they did not  merely want  to  draw onthe  swap  line  as  they ran  out  of  assets but  that  they  already had gonedeeply into  debt.  We  weren't going  to  be  the  first  creditor  in  line.Returning  to  the  Bundesbank  example, what  has  clearly  eclipsed allthis  is  an  increasing  sophistication  in  the  liquidity management  ofthe portfolio  of  the  Bundesbank.  As  I have  described to  the  Committeein  the past,  they maintain  a  large  amount  of  immediately availableliquidity  in  case  they need dollars  for  intervention purposes  and  theystructure  their portfolio  accordingly.  So,  the  likelihood  that  theBundesbank  is  going  to  look to  the  swap  line  for  liquidity purposes  isquite low.  As  the  Chairman said  a year ago,  we realize  that  the  swap11/15/95lines  are  somewhat anachronistic,  but  getting rid  of  them could bemore painful  than  carrying them  forward.  I think we  might all  benefitby rethinking the  nature of  our central  bank cooperation.  Maybe whenwe are  through with  this  exercise  with the  Japanese  and have beenrepaid on  the Mexican  swap  line,  it  might  be  useful  for  the  Committeeto  review  the purpose  of  these  cooperative  facilities.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Peter,  it  strikes me  that  these  swapline renewals,  for which  there basically  is  no  longer  any financial  oreconomic  purpose,  have become  exchanges  of  Christmas  cards  that  serveto maintain  our  relationships with various  central  banks.  Even  at  a  3percent  inflation rate,  these  lines  are  gradually becoming de minimis.If we wanted  to  get rid of  them,  there  is  a very simple way of  doingit:  We would talk  to  the Germans  and say  "look, this  makes no  sense,let's  cancel  it."  Once  we cancel  the  Bundesbank arrangement,  the  restof  them will  just  go  away because  it will  be  perceived that  if  we dothat  to  the Bundesbank  then doing  that  to  Norway,  for example,  willnot be  considered a withdrawal  of  Christmas  card privileges.  So,  Ithink it  may be appropriate  to  do  something at  some  time.  It's  justnot  credible  under any reasonable  circumstances  that  these  swap  lineswill  be activated.  It's  probably best not  to  have  something on  ourbooks  that  has  no  operational  significance.  I think we  might consideracting  on your  suggestion  of  looking  at  this  after  the Mexican  swapissue  is  settled.  It's  conceivable that  we  ought  to  review this  thenand decide what we  wish  to  do.  We  may just  decide  to  leave  the  swapline  network  alone  and  let  it  wither  on the  vine.

[SECTION]

MR. TRUMAN.  My assumption--it's a very safe  assumption, Mr.Chairman--is  that  in  the  case  of  the Bundesbank and  the  Bank of  Japanyou would be  giving  a  signal by cancelling the  swap  lines.  For  thereasons  you  cited, some people would not  want  to  do  that  and wetherefore  have  a problem with respect  to  the  Norwegians,  which  is  aparticularly bad example.  My perspective  on  this  has been,  as  I mayhave  said before when we have had  these discussions,  that  the  time  torationalize  these arrangements  is  in  the  context  of  European monetaryunion,  if  they get  to  the  third  stage of  having a European  centralbank.  In  that  case  most  of  these countries would have  an  arrangementwith  the  European central  bank.  Since Norway  is  outside  the union,you  would have  a slightly complicated  situation, but  a number  of  theseswap  lines  would be  captured  in  that  arrangement.  Now,  if  we want  todo  away with them completely,  that  is  a  different proposition.  Ithink  it  is  also  worthwhile  to  think  about  whether we  could imagineusing swap  arrangements  in  the  context  of  payments  system problems.In  that  case,  as  President Jordan  suggested, we obviously would needmore  than  $250  million.  It  would be  a very  different operation.Because  these  arrangements  always  have  the  characteristics  of  lender-of-last-resort  arrangements  as  well  as  helping through what  could bejust glitches  in  the payments  system,  they are not  easy  toorchestrate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I have  the  view that  thesearrangements  have  long outlived  their usefulness.  I have  been inPeter's  position and  largely have  argued  that  we may as  well  renewthem because  not  doing  so  would be  a newsworthy event.  Each yearthere usually was  something happening  so  that  we  didn't  want  thatnewsworthy  event  to  occur.  It  would  seem  to  me  that,  without11/15/95-8-mandating  that  a year  from now Peter and Ted  come back with a proposalnot  to  renew the  swap  lines,  we  should become  reasonably  active  in  aneffort  to  work out  a more meaningful  alternative  that  probably wouldinclude  ending  the  swap  lines.  Whether  or not  one needs  to  substitutefor  them  some  notion of  how we  would cope  at  a time  of  some realliquidity need,  I think terminating  the  swap arrangements would be  astep very much in  the  right direction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are  you suggesting  some  formal  orinformal  agreements--bilateral  agreements  in  a sense?

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I don't  think  that  we would needeven  an  informal  agreement,  as  our discussions with the  Bank of  Japanhave suggested.  If  a need comes  along and we  have  the  kinds ofrelationships  that  we  now enjoy with the  other  central banks,  at  thattime  we can  sit down and  figure out  what  if  anything has  to be done.If  the approval  of  the  FOMC were needed, we would ask  for  it.  I thinkI would prefer  that  approach.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Peter,  you mentioned that  on Thursday andFriday,  some  of  the  Treasury securities  maturing  on November 15started to  sell  at  some discount.  How much was  it?  I was  on  anairplane  at  that  time,  and  I didn't  see  the market  quotations.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Those  securities had  already been  selling  off  abit,  and  that's  rather  awkward  for  a security with  a short  remainingmaturity.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  That's why  I was  asking.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The  amount  is  small  in  absolute  terms,  but  it  isnoticeable  that  dealers  are  turning  them down.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I meant  the yield  to maturity, not  the prices.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don't know it  off  the  top  of  my head,  I'mafraid.  I think we discussed  it  in  the  document we  submitted as  aspecial  report.  Sandy--please  go ahead.

[SECTION]

MS.  KRIEGER.  Because  those  November  15th  coupons are  soclose  to  maturity,  the  smallest  increment  in price  that  you can  see  onthe  screen  is  70  basis  points  of  yield.  If  I tell  you that  it  tradedwith  a 1/256  change  in price,  I am  telling you  70  basis  points,  whichis  incredibly dramatic.  But  I can't  observe  anything  that  is  smallerthan  that  on  the  screen.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I see.

[SECTION]

MS.  KRIEGER.  A better  comparison would be  the  bills  thatmature  on  the  16th, which also  were of  somewhat  uncertain value  then,but  unfortunately I don't know  the  change  in  yield.  That  is  an  easiercomparison because  it's  a  shorter  instrument.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Did  those  come back  after  theannouncement?11/15/95-9-

[SECTION]

MS.  KRIEGER.  Yes.  There does  not  seem  to  be  a distortion  inthe November  30  coupons.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further  questions  for Peter  on  this?President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman,  I just want  to  comment  on  thebackground of  the  informal  arrangement with the Japanese.  The memothat we  got was very helpful.  In  the phone  calls  that  I received,there were  two  issues  that  warranted some explanation.  One was  thatthe arrrangement  was  a bailout,  and  I think  that notion  followed uponthe Mexican deal.  The other was  that  the  discount window was  somehowinvolved and that  we would be  lending  at  the basic  discount  rate  tosubsidize  the Japanese.  Dispelling  those  distortions became  the  dutyof  the day.  I think  these  issues are  still  a matter  of  concern  amongsome  individuals  in  the market  or  in  the banking  industry, or whereverelse  the distortions persist.  I think  it was  good that  we got  thememo and  as  much information as  we  did because we received a  lot  ofphone  calls  related  to  this  fear  of  subsidizing the  Japanese.

In  fact,  the  purpose  of  our discussionwith  the Japanese was  mainly  to  dispel  any notion of  subsidization.If  it  were  not  for  the  fact  that  they are  such a  large presence  inthis  banking  system,  there  really would not be  an  issue.  But  if  theywere to  run into  trouble, we  could be  dealing with very large  numbers.

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I think the  individuals  I spoke  to  realizedthat.  That's  why they were  saying  that  if  a problem were  to  occur, wemight get  involved  in  a discount  window loan;  and lending  at  the  basicdiscount  rate would mean  a big  subsidy.  The  issue was why would weallow  that,  and on and  on  it  went.  Because  they had  this piece  ofmisinformation, their  concerns  multiplied very quickly.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  happens.  Further questions  forPeter?  Train wreck?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We  need a vote  to  ratify  the  domesticoperations.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I missed three  out  of  three!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Move  approval.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is  there  a second?

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection.  I hope  there  isnothing to  ratify  in  the next  segment!

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No, no,  I'm not  seeking  another  vote.[Statement  continued--see Appendix.]Mr. Chairman,  I would be  happy to  answer  any questions  fromthe Committee  on  this  final  part  of  my report.  But  maybe you are  alltired  of  listening  to my voice,  and I wouldn't mind if  you pass.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Never!  President Melzer.11/15/95-10-

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Peter,  I would  just  like  to  say  that  I endorsethe position you  just  expressed.  I think  there  are  a lot  of  risksassociated with  that.  We  have  to  evaluate  things  as  they develop, butI wholeheartedly support  what you  are  saying.  Ultimately,  I think  itruns  to  even broader  issues  like  the  independence  of  the central  bankand our  commitment  to  long-term price  stability and those  sorts  ofthings.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I agree  very much with Tom  and I certainlyendorse  that  position.  I wonder  if  I may  ask a related question, Mr.Chairman.  Is  it  possible that  in  some  of  our operations  other  thanDesk operations,  things  like  Fedwire, we might  wind up  inadvertentlymaking loans  to  the Treasury?  Has  that  kind of possibility beenconsidered?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  An  inadvertent  overdraft?

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Yes.  In  our Fedwire  rules,  as  I understandit,  we  guarantee  final  payment  at  the  end  of  the  day.  If  on  the  daythe Treasury defaulted we  guaranteed  some  of  these payments,  could webe  caught  at  the  end of  the day  in  an overdraft  position?  It  seems  tome  it  is  the  same  kind of  issue.  I guess  there  is  an  array ofpossibilities.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It's  illegal  for us  to  grant  anoverdraft  to  the Treasury.  The  only condition under which  it  existsis  inadvertence.  I assume  I have  that  right.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Correct.  Reserve  Bank  and Board staff  have  beentalking  to  Treasury people about  procedures  to  follow  to  avoid  theconcern that  President Broaddus  just  expressed,  so  that  wires  wouldn'tbe  sent  if  funds were not going  to  be  available.  We want  to  ensurethat  Treasury staff  sending those wires  understand  that  and  simplywould not  send  them.  Those  are  among  the  procedures  that  have beenunder discussion between the  technical  staffs  at  the Treasury  and theFederal Reserve.  The  Treasury is  fully aware  of  the position  thatChairman Greenspan just  stated--that we  cannot  lend to  them directly.If  they got  into  an overdraft position, it  would have  to  be  entirelyinadvertent.  Therefore,  in their  financing  operations,  they have beentalking  about  keeping  their  cash balance  fairly  high to  avoid  thepossibility that  funds  would  clear that  would put  them  in  overdraftinadvertently.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  In recent  months  and years, we  collectively havebeen targeting  a balance  of  about  $5 billion  for  them.  But we  allrecognize that  forecasting  the  Treasury balance  is  in part  an  art,  nota science,  and the  risks  exist.  But  it's  in  the  nature  of  a  forecastthat  we  are  always  forecasting  tonight what  the  cash balance will bewhen we wake up  tomorrow morning and  then  tomorrow what  it  will  bewhen we make payments  on  the  Treasury's behalf.  We  at  the  Desk werevery pleased  that  the  Treasury made  their  announcement as  early aspossible  this  week because  of  the  various uncertainties we  would facein our  forecasts  of  their balances  if  we waited until  the  1lth  hour toworry about  default  and  the market  did  the  same,  and  given  thecomputer  systems  that  release payments  early in  the morning.  So,  the11/15/95 -11-Monday morning announcement was very much what  we  had urged  on  them  interms  of  the  number of  days  that  we needed  for  guidance.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  This  is  admittedly a very  airy-fairycontingency  if  we  don't  think this  default  is  going  to  happen.  Butlet me  go back  into  the  mindset  that  you were in  a minute  ago.  Howmany government  securities  issues are  there,  something  like  300?

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  260  something.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  How many of  those  do we own  a piece  of?  Almostall?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Virtually all.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  How many of  them do we  actually buy  and sell?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  On  any one  day?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  No.  If  I watched you  for  a whole quarter,  howmany issues  might  you have  dealt  in  either doing  repos  or  buyingoutright  or anything?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Most  of  them.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Right.  Therefore, what kind of  signal  wouldyou send  if  you  told  the market  that  these  55  issues  are being  shunnedby  the  Federal  Reserve,  that we  are  not  accepting  them.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  It  would send  a very negative message.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Isn't  that  what  you are  suggesting?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No,  I  said nothing  in  my remarks  that  suggestedthat.  I said the  Desk was  eager  to  find a way  to  demonstrate  thatthey would be  accepted as  collateral  in  temporary operations.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  But we wouldn't  do  open market  operations?  Ithought  that's what you  said.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Temporary operations  are open  market  operations.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  What were you  suggesting?  I missed  it.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  My point was  that  I did not  think that  anintentional  preemptive  strike  to buy  the  particular  defaultedsecurities  outright would be  an appropriate  action  in  thecircumstances  that  I mentioned.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I thought we  were  talking about  purchases  inthe  market.

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  Yes,  we  are.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  I guess  I am  confused.11/15/95-12-

[SECTION]

MR.  FISHER.  We  do  outright purchases  relatively  infrequently--to  wit my discussion  about  coupon passes--a handful  of  times  a year.I am suggesting that  we  raise  that  to  three  or  four handfuls  a yearfor  reasons  of  operational simplicity without  changing the  amount  wewould buy over  the  course  of  the year relative  to  reserve  demands.The  question  is  whether we take  defaulted  securities  in  temporaryoperations.  In  repo  operations, we  take whatever  securities  thedealers  offer.  We  are  not  going to  announce  in  advance  that  we aregoing  to  turn  down any particular Treasury  security in repooperations.  The  idea  that  I urge  the  Committee  to  put  on  the backburner  for much later  consideration  is  the  question of whether wewould buy  outright preemptively  those particular  issues  that  theTreasury had defaulted upon.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  That  is,  a special  open market  operation and notthe  normal  course  of  business.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chairman.

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I think  the question has  twoaspects, Mr.  Chairman.  One  is  the purely practical  view of  peoplewhose expertise  is  in  markets,  as  mine used to  be,  as  to  what  is  thebest  thing  to  do  to  maintain  an orderly market  in  the  event  of  adefault.  I am  in  complete agreement with  Peter's  and  Sandy's  andDon's view that  the best  thing  to  do  is  to  take  these  in  repooperations because  that  would maintain  their  status  as  securities  andkeep  them alive.  That's  by far  the best  thing  to  do.  Then you  canget  into  a question of  high purpose.  Is  it  in  the best  interest ofthe  central  bank to  do  it?  That's  the  second question.  I happen  toagree with Peter on  that  one,  too.  This  is  one  case  where purepragmatism  says  we should  do what  they  suggest,  and  I think highprinciple  leads  us  to  the  same  conclusion.  But  we don't  even  need toget  into  the  high principle.  Pure pragmatism  is  such  an  absolute no-brainer  that  that's  what we ought  to  do  in  any event.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I am going  to  follow up  on what  GovernorBlinder  said.  If  you  are  taking whatever  is  offered on  the  opendefault  or potential  default  that  people  might have questions  about?If  you  are willing to  take  whatever  is  offered  and you are not willingto  discriminate  against  defaulted  securities, won't you  end up  takinga disproportionate number  of  them?

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  If  they were presented  to  us  as  propositions  fortemporary overnight  or  four-day System  operations,  and  they were atthe better  end  of  the prices,  we would  look at  what  are  the  bestprices  and draw a  line  at  an  amount  that  meets  our  objective.  Mydesire  would be  for  the  Desk to  be  indifferent  to what  the CUSIPs  are,whether  the  CUSIP underneath  is  one that  has missed a payment  or not.Now, maybe  these  securities  will end up  among the  better prices;that's a  likely hypothesis  if  the  dealers  are  on  their  toes.  Theymight be  a  large portion  of  what we  did  or  they might be  only a  smallpart of  our  overall  operation given  the  uncertainties  about  the  volumewe would be  doing.  So,  yes,  there  is  a certain  likelihood that wewould  take  in  some,  or many, or  all  of  them  in  temporary operations11/15/95-13-where  the  legal  risks  of an  extended duration of  a Treasury defaultremain with  the dealer.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Implicit  in your question  is  that  whenwe conduct  our operations,  a  certain number of  securities  are  offeredin  the market  and we choose  to buy or not  to  buy.  As  a practicalmatter, all  securities  are  offered  in  the market  at  all  times.  Thereare  active prices  on  all  of  them.  Thus,  it's not  as  though  there  is  alimited block of  securities  out  there  that  would disproportionatelyinclude  defaulted securities.  As  a practical  matter, all  securitiesin the  market  are  offered  in  indeterminate  amounts  and  that  wouldpresumably include  all  of  these  defaulted securities.  I think thecritical  issue  implied  in your question  is  that,  if  these  defaultedsecurities  are being priced at  significant discounts and we buy them,we  get  criticized for  buying U.S. Treasuries  at  a discount.  If  wedon't buy  them, we  get  criticized  for  not buying  them at a discount.It's  an  impossible situation.  But  I  suspect  that  should  this  occur,it's  going  to  be  very fuzzy as  to  what  is  in  the market,  at whatprice,  and who  is  selling what.  The question we  have  always had onthe  table  implicitly  is  not  whether or not we  should do  overnight RPsor  something of  that  nature.  It  is  whether we  should make  directpurchases  and  inventory the  securities  in  the  System portfolio.  Theimplication of  not  doing it  is  that  we would resell  them in  theof whether we  do  a pass  on  defaulted securities.  I suspect  that  has  alot  of  implications  that  raise  some  technical  questions,  as  Peter  issuggesting.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Beyond the  technical  issues,  aren't we  dealingwith a moral hazard  situation  in  the  sense  that  if  we  show ourselvesready to  close  all  the  gaps when  these  situations  occur,  the  chance  oftheir happening with  greater  frequency increases?  I think it'sentirely appropriate  to  come  at  it  from  the point  of  view of  financialstability.  The only question  I have  is  whether being  willing to  usematured  securities as  collateral  and to  do  repo  operations  in  maturedsecurities  says  that  we are  willing to  accept  the moral  hazard up  to  acertain point where we,  arguably, need to  do  that  for  the  sake  ofstability in  the markets  and  financial  stability  for  the  country as  awhole, but  beyond that  we  will  not go.  I think that's  a perfectlyappropriate message  to  send and position  to  take,  but  I think thatit's  not  just  on  the  outright  operations  that we  run the  risk ofrunning counter  to  a high principle.  We run  that  risk  doing anythingwith  these matured securities.  I think what  Peter has  proposed  isdefensible, but  I don't  think we  take  ourselves  out  of  the  arena ofthe problems  that  he mentioned simply by drawing  a line  and not  doingcoupon passes  in  matured securities.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further  questions  for  Peter  on  thisissue?  If  not,  let's  move  to Mike  Prell  and  the  staff  report  on  theeconomy.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Mike?  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mike,  in  Part  II  of  the  Greenbook, there  is  areference  to  the prospect  that  manufacturing  capacity growth  is  goingto be  revised up  in  light  of  some  surveys  in  1993  and 1994  and  also11/15/95-14-the new  investment  that  has  occurred  in  1995.  I wonder  how much  of  aneffect  these  pending  revisions will  have  in terms  of  the  staff'sassessment  of  price pressures  in  various product  markets  and also  whatimpact  it  might have  on  either  the  level  or  growth of  potential?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  At  this  point  we  don't  see  anything in  the  cardsthat  is  going  to  change  the picture materially.  We have  hadrelatively rapid  expansion of  capacity  in  our  forecast,  and  theincoming data  in  the updated survey  on  investment have  supported  that.We will  be  revising our numbers  on production and capacityutilization, but my sense  from  talking to  people  who  are  engaged  inthat work  is  that  this  isn't  going  to  change  the picture materially.Basically, we  think we have  something  that's pretty much parallel  toour  assessment  of  the  labor  market.  We are  a little  on  the  tight  sideof  what  would be  "nonaccelerating" inflation over  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On the  CPI,  what  do  the  numbers  looklike  with an  additional  decimal point?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't  know that.  I just  looked at  the  roundeddata here which  show a core  CPI  increase  last  month of  exactly  .3percent,  but  I don't have  the  data with  the Board  staff's  estimate.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  They are  short  on  staff  up  there;  they can'tgive  you  two  decimal  places!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Mike,  I have  a couple  of  largely unrelatedquestions.  I will  take  them  one  at  a time.  Your projections  in  theGreenbook  of  nominal  GDP  for  1996  and  1997  have  been revised up  fromthe previous Greenbook.  Nevertheless,  nominal  spending  growth, afteraccelerating  a bit  to  a little  over  5 percent  in the  third quarter,is  on  a downward trend to  under  4 percent  in  the  second  half of  1997.That was  true  before and  it  is  still  true  in  the  latest Greenbookwhere  it  is  down  to  the  3.8  to  3.9  percent  range  for  the  second  halfof  1997.  Your  forecast now  also  assumes  a 5-3/4  percent  fed  fundsrate--and  I will make  some  remarks  about  that  not  appearing  to  be asrestrictive as  previously envisaged--and the  bond market  has ralliedbecause markets  thought  that  we would  lower the  funds  rate.  If  youtake  that  away,  it  says  bond yields  are now expected to  go  back upfrom current  levels while  both nominal  growth and real  growth aregoing  down.  I am  trying  to  imagine  how those  work out,  especially howthey would play out  in  the marketplace  if  people  actually  saw thingsthat were  reported along  the  lines  of  the  Greenbook projection.  Whatthat means  is  that  in  the  latter part  of  the projection period, youwould have  nominal  interest  rates  running 2-1/4,  2-1/2  percentagepoints  or more  above nominal  GDP growth.  What  kind of  stories wouldyou  tell  about  the  anticipated  inflation  component of  nominal  interestrates  versus  the  reported  inflation rates  that you project,  or  theanticipated or  ex  ante  real  rates  as  opposed  to  the  real  growth  ratesin your  GDP projections?  I have  trouble  reconciling what you  sayabout  financial  markets,  nominal  interest  rates,  and your projectionsfor  the  economy.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  have  discussed  this  in  the past,  and  as  Isaid, we  pondered this  question of  whether having nominal  interestrates  running higher  than nominal  GDP  growth over  time  is  an unnatural11/15/95-15-relationship.  It  strikes  one  as  being  something  that  isunsustainable.  We  think of  this,  in  terms  of  government budgetpositions  and  so  on, as  a relationship  that's  unsustainable.  But  overlimited periods  of  time,  this  relationship  clearly has variedtremendously,  and  there  isn't  a very compelling  short-run macro  storythat  pushes you  toward  equilibrating  these  things or  having  thenominal GDP  growth rate  higher  than  the nominal  interest rate.Certainly, our view in  formulating this  revised  forecast  is  that,given real  interest rates  in  the current  environment--one  in which weare  experiencing ample  availability of  credit,  and we  looked at  allthe  other parameters  of  financial  conditions  at  this  point--these realinterest  rates  are  not  creating quite  the  damping effect  on aggregatedemand that  we anticipated  earlier.  But we do  expect  that  they willcreate  some  drag on  final  demand and  that we will  have  this  taperingoff  in  the  growth of  consumer  and business  expenditures.  We thinkthere  is  a coherent  story here.  But  it  does  in  essence  have  implicitin  it,  if  you  like that  model,  a relatively high natural  real  rate  ofinterest  for  the  forecast  period.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Right.  It  implies  de  facto a progressively morerestrictive policy  stance.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We  have  intermediate-  and  long-term rates  risingin nominal  terms,  but we  see no  reason  to  think that  inflationexpectations  for  the  intermediate to  long  run will  change materially.The  3 percent  inflation that  we are  forecasting  is  very much in  linewith what private  forecasters  are  expecting.  I think  the  surveyevidence  suggests  that  expectations  for  inflation over  theintermediate  run probably run in  the  3 to  4 percent  range.  I don'tthink  that  would change  a great  deal.  You  are  correct  in  noting  thatthe uptick  in real  interest  rates has  a damping effect  in  theforecast.  It's  one  of  the  things  that  contributes  to  the  decelerationof  fixed investment,  residential and nonresidential,  and gives us  thismoderation  in  growth going  forward.

[SECTION]

MR.  JORDAN.  My other question relates  to  productivity.  Ivery much welcome  the  discussion of  higher productivity growth  thatwas  in  the Greenbook--a  sort  of  level  effect  and  rate of  changeeffect,  the  way I read it--as  far  as  it went.  But  it  didn't  go  so  faras  to  change  the perceived output  capacity situation versus  theinflation rate.  We have  this  3 percent  inflation rate;  we  just  sortof  drove  to  it.  Once  here,  it  seems  we  can't  get  away from  it.  Iwant  to  offer  an  alternative way of  reading  the  numbers and  get yourreaction  to  it.  I read a little  of  this  in  the  Greenbook, but  it  justdidn't  go  as  far  as  I thought  it  might.  We  not  only have  had  a lot  ofinvestment  in business  fixed  investment,  to  which Bob  Parry wasreferring, but  also a very  substantial  increase  in business  spendingon  training, both  internal  and  external.  The  response  to  theperceived tightness  of  the  labor market--the Chairman  commented at  anearlier meeting  about  the  insecurity  of  capital  over  the  life  of  agiven  technology--has  led  companies  to  increase  markedly  the amountthat  they are  spending  to  train  their  workers.  Resorting  forefficiency  reasons  to  economic  jargon,  that  says  to  me  that  thehorizontal  axis  does  not measure  the  supply and  demand for  labor  inhomogeneous  units because  the quality  of  the  labor  force  is  changing,perhaps  especially at  the  entry  level.  That  says  to  me  that  theinflation potential  that  you would have  thought  associated with  agiven physical  capacity has  to  be  different.  It's  not  a one-time11/15/95-16-level  effect  to  the extent  that  there  is  this persistent  investment  inhuman capital  going on  coupled with the  changes  in  technology.Whatever  you previously  thought would be  the  inflation  rate  associatedwith  some  output potential,  it  has got  to  be  lower.  I don't  see,  inthe  Greenbook discussion or  the projections,  any allowance  for  thosekinds  of  dynamics  to  lead  to  a  lower rate  of  inflation  than  historicalexperience would suggest.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Let  me make  several  comments.  I probably won'tbe  able  to  achieve  absolute  coherence here.  In a  sense, we  haveintroduced a supply  shock into  this  forecast  to  the  extent  that  wehave  lowered our NAIRU and  in  essence  have  raised  the potential  outputceiling.  On  the  trend of  potential  output  growth,  the analysis  thatwe have  offered is  that  when one  looks  at  data--not  on a  1987  fixed-price basis,  but  on a more recent  base year  or chain-weighted basis--recent  evidence  of  surprises  in productivity growth disappears.  Weseem to be  running on a  trend that  has  been  in place  for well  over  aIt  doesn't  suggest  that  we had a big  surprise  in  the  last  couple  ofquarters.  It  doesn't  suggest  that  there has  been a radical  revolutionover this  decade relative  to where  we were  running before.  Now, thatearlier.  There may be  components  that  could be added  in and  so  on,but  those  add to  both potential  and actual measured GDP  and don'talter  the  output gap.  So  that  doesn't  imply anything  different  aboutthe pressures  on  the  inflation  side.Training is  an  interesting question.  I would remind you  thattraining costs  money.  It's  a  cost,  as  you've  characterized  it,  ofproduction.  It  would have  to  be  made up  on  the  price  side.  So  it'snot  a  free  good.  Second,  I am not  sure  how clear  the  data are.  Ithink  there may be  bits  and pieces  around  about how much  expenditureson  training have  increased.  I  am not well  versed in  that,  but  I havecertainly seen anecdotal  reports  of  it  here and  there.  Some  of  thestories  I have  seen over  the  years have  suggested that  a  lot  of  thistraining goes  to  managers--upper  level  people.  They are getting  allkinds  of  training that  may not have particularly  obvious payoffs  inproduction.  I could cite  the  training here at  the  Federal  Reserve.[Laughter]  It  will  be  five  years  before my colleagues  in HRM hearthat  and  in the  interim you  are all  sworn  to  secrecy!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But  they  aren't  the  only ones who  care![Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Furthermore,  a lot  of  this  training  is  remedial.Many of  you have  reported what  directors  and other  contacts  have  toldyou about  how it's  really hard  to  find workers  who  are  literate  ornumerate.  A  question might be  raised as  to whether  they have  to  spendmore  and more money just  to  maintain  the  quality of  labor  input  thatthey  are accustomed  to.  In  a  sense,  one  of  the  reasons  for  some  ofthis  investment  in computerization--I  have  speculated about  this  withmy  colleagues, who  would rather  I not  say this--may  be  to  make up  forsome  of  the deficiencies  of  the  work force.  A  simple  example  issomething  like  fast  food outlets  where workers  are  able  to  tell youwhat you  owe  them without having  to  enter  in  any numbers.  They justpunch a button that  has a picture of  a  "Whopper" or whatever  it  is.  Ithink we  need  to  be  a  little cautious  here  in  thinking  that  there  is  arevolution  in  progress  leading  to  an  improvement  of  the  labor  force.11/15/95-17-We all  recognize  that  achieving  the  gains  in productivity  that  mightpotentially result  from the  investment  in high-tech  informationprocessing  equipment  will  only  be achieved when people  know how to  usethe  equipment,  reorganize production processes  accordingly, and thewhole  infrastructure  is  developed.  Maybe  it's  still  ahead and maybewe  are not  optimistic  enough  going  forward.  But  from what we  can seeto  date,  we feel  pretty  comfortable with our  assessment  of  the  trendsin potential  output.

MR. JORDAN.  Just  one  follow-up  thought:  You remarked  thattraining  is  a cost  that  needs  to  be passed  through  to prices.  This  isnot  the  case  if  it  really  is  improving the value  of what  workers  do.Even if  it  is  remedial,  to  the  extent  that  the value  of  the marginalproduct  of  the  work--that's what  I meant  about  the  horizontal  axisunits are not homogeneous--you are  in effect  shifting  the  labor  supplyfunction.  Then,  for  the  same  ECI,  you would not  expect  to  see  thesame  associated consumer price  index that  you previously would haveassociated with  it.  I don't  know how big  that  is,  just  its  direction.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Actually  I have  two questions  about  this  path,particularly of  household durables  spending.  The fourth  quarter  of1995  number  seems  high.  Is  that  a growth  rate of  11.3  percent?  Isthat  a misprint?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Isn't  it  mainly  computers?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  This  is  consumer durables  spending excludingmotor vehicles  in  our  forecast,  As  we have  suggested, we  think  therewill probably be  some  improvement  in  sales  of  appliances  and homefurnishings  in connection with  the  surge  in  home  sales  that  we  sawover  the  summer;  reports  seem  reasonably  favorable  into  early  fall.Second, we  anticipate  that  there  will  be  some  considerable strength  inhome  electronics,  computers,  and  other such  items--hardware andsoftware.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Is  it  basically a Christmas phenomenon  and thenit  falls  off  next year?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Obviously,  the housing  element  flattens  out.  Wehave  a weaker motor vehicle  contribution  in  the  first quarter.  Yes,this  is  a big  Christmas  for  computer  buying in  our  thinking.  I don'twant  to  get  too  fancy  about  this.  Obviously, whether  the  sales  occurin December  or  in  January isn't  of  great  moment  for  the GDP  forecast--and certainly not  for monetary policy--because  the production mightoccur anyway on  this  schedule.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Incidentally, is  computer  software  aconsumer durable  good?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Yes,  and  I think it  gets  counted with books  andother things  and in  many cases probably  is  bought  at  the  same outlets.That's  one  of  the  real  problems  in  gauging  the  actual  level  ofexpenditures.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What  actually is  being sold  is  a disk orsomething  that  is  hard.11/15/95-18-

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The question  is  whether it  lasts  very  long  orwhether you  have  to  go  out  and buy a new one  next  year when you buyyour  replacement  computer.  That  is  where  it's  counted.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Second part  of  the  question.  You've got  PCEgrowing  fast.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Let  me just  say  this.  The  incoming data havebeen weaker and  that  would be  a component  of  this  downgrading of  thePCE that  I suggested would be  appropriate  at  this point.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I have  been  trying  to  eyeball  it.  Is  PCEgenerally growing a  little more quickly than  income?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  As  you  know,  the personal  saving  rate  is  4.4percent  in  the  forecast and  it  has  been  4.4 percent.  So,  nominalexpenditures  are  roughly keeping pace with nominal  income.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Then why does  the  forecast  go off  the  cliff  inthe  third quarter of  1997?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Probably inadvertence  in  the  forecasting process.Let's  take  a  look  again.  The  latter part  of  the year  is  weaker  in1997.  The  saving rate  is  down  because  of  the  intra-yearly  tax patternthat  we  have  and our assumptions about  how people will  spend their  taxcuts.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  But  you have  consumption  down and,  inparticular,  durable  purchases  are  down  in  the  third quarter of  1997.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We  do  have a deceleration going on  at  the  end  of1997  in general.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I see.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Mike, what you  are  saying  about productivityprompted a  question that  I didn't  think  of  before.  If  you  feedthrough the  investment burst,  so  to  speak, of  the  last  three yearsinto  the  capital  stock and  into  a production  function  and  it  doesnothing  to  total  factory productivity, what  should  it  do  to  laborproductivity?  How much  of  a  fillip  to  labor productivity  ought we  tohave  gotten  from  this?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  As  you may recall,  it  wasn't  until  quite  recentlythat  levels  of  investment  got  to  the  point where  we were  really addingrapidly to  the  capital  stock.  My  sense  is  that  those  people who  wouldtry to  approach  estimation of what  labor productivity  should bethrough  a production  function  find some  pretty substantial  rates  ofincrease  in  labor productivity  in  1987  dollars.  My  recollection  is1-3/4  percent.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I would  take your previous  criticism as  beingvalid.  We  probably ought  to  view those  in  1994  dollars  or  chainweighted.  Otherwise, we  could get  excited  about  something  that  is  notthere.11/15/95-19-

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Indeed, how  strong  investment  has  been isobviously important  to  the  story.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  These numbers  aren't  in  my head.  But  eventhough  some  of  the  chain-weighted numbers have  been  low, it  is  stillthe  case  that  "K" has been growing significantly  faster  than  "L."Labor productivity is  still  growing at  1 percent  a year,  right?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  Yes.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  "L" has  been rising  for  three  years, but  Idon't  have  the  number  in my head.  Do you know how much it  hasincreased?

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I don't have  the number  in my head for what youwould derive  from a production  function  approach.  But  I know  fromtalking  to  people  like  Larry Meyer  and  from our  own quarterly modelwork  that  one  could  argue for  a somewhat  higher number  than we haveembedded in our  forecast.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Net?

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Yes, net.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That has been  going up.

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  That's  all  a matter  of  model  estimation.  Thereis  still  the  question  of what  the  actual  experience  has  been.  Thesimplest way  of  looking  at  this  is,  if  you believe  in  Okun's  law and,admittedly, it  is  not  a precise  relationship  in  every time  period,that  there  is  nothing  in  the behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  thatwould suggest  that  we  have been grossly  underestimating the  growthpotential  of  output.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I agree with  that.  Suppose  you did thiscalculation and it  came  out--I'll make up a number, because  I don'tknow what  it  is--that  it  should add  .4 percent  on  first  principle  tolabor productivity.  That  means  total  factor productivity deceleratedbecause  the  evidence  is  as  you  said;  I'm not  disputing that  at  all.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  For some  time  now,  I have  been asking people  inBoston  if  we  can  learn  anything about  the  current  situation or bebetter  informed about  the current  situation by looking  at  the  late1980s  experience  and seeing how  long we  were below our  estimate  of  theNAIRU at  that  point  before  inflation  started to  accelerate.  They keeptelling me  that we  are nowhere  near  as  far below  the NAIRU now  as  wewere  then,  and we were  that  way  for  a longer  period of  time  in  thatperiod.  Given  the  recent  small  uptick  in hourly compensation andwhere we  are  with  the  unemployment rate,  I don't debate  your choice  ofa new NAIRU.  I  think  it's  closer  to  what we had been thinking  it  was.But  I just  wonder whether prospectively we  are  starting  to  seesomething  like what  we saw  in  the  late  '80s.  Or  are you  reallythinking of  this  as  just  minor  noise here?

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  I think  some  would argue  that  what we  are  seeingthat  is  reminiscent of  the  late  1980s  is  this  undaunted optimism on my11/15/95-20-part.  [Laughter]  There  is  a distinct  chance  that  this  will  begreater  degree  of  optimism on  how  low the NAIRU might  be  just whenthings were  starting  to  turn.

[SECTION]

MS.  MINEHAN.  You have!

[SECTION]

MR.  PRELL.  We were  somewhat  seduced  at  that  time  by the  runof  good experience after we had hit  what we  thought was probable  NAIRUterritory.  As we  saw  the unemployment rate  moving  in  the  5 to  5-1/2percent  zone,  we  got  a  little more optimistic  than  in  retrospect weshould have  and  there  is  the  risk  that  that  is  also  the  case  at  thispoint.  In  terms  of  sheer econometric  tests,  you  can't  say  that  theexperience  that  we  have  had over  the past year,  a relatively briefperiod, deviates  in a  statistically  significant way  from what modelpredictions would have been based on  a NAIRU as  high as  the  roughly5.9  percent  that  we  had before  we made  this  change,  or  even numbers  inthe  low  sixes.  Compensation per hour  numbers have  begun to  push  theenvelope  a bit.  But  if  you  look  at  reduced  form models  with prices,there  is  certainly no  inconsistency with a higher NAIRU.  I think wehave  cautioned,  at  least  implicitly  in what we've  said,  that  we  aremaking an  assessment  of  what  we  see  going  on now and what  is  likely tobe  going on  in  the  near  term in  light  of  all  the  factors  affecting  theeconomic  environment.  It  is  not necessarily  the  case  that  we canexpect  the  NAIRU  to  be  permanently  lower  than what we have previouslythought  it  to  be.  There may have been  some  short-run  favorable  supplyside  effects,  so  to  speak,  that helped push  the  short-run NAIRU belowwhere we  thought  it  was,  and it  may pop  back up.  We need  to  be  verycautious  and continue  to watch  this.  Some  people point  to  the  othercompensation-per-hour numbers  that  come out  in  the productivity  costrelease,  and conclude  that  that has  turned  up--Larry Meyer,  forexample, and  that's  perhaps because  it  fits  his  model.  It  is  truethat  there  certainly has been no  deceleration in  core CPI  this  year.The  latest  data  are a  little worse  than  they have been for  the  lastfew months.  But given  the  average  hourly  earnings  and  the  slightuptick  in  the  core  CPI,  I would rather  have had  the numbers  go  theother way  than have had my neck stuck  out  this  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN  GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder  raised the  questionbefore  the meeting as  to  which week  the unemployment  rate  survey willbe  taking place.  Since  the  12th  is  on  a  Sunday, do  they  look at  theprevious week  or  this  week?

[SECTION]

MR.  STOCKTON.  My understanding, Mr.  Chairman, is  that  if  thegovernment shutdown extends  beyond  this week,  they will  not  be  in  thefield next week with  the  household  survey.  This  week  is  the  referenceweek  and next  week they will  be  out  in  the  field actually  doing  thesurvey.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  There  is  also  possible  irreparable  damage  to  thefield all  month  getting quotes.  Those people presumably  are not  outin  the  field now.  If  they get  back soon,  this  may not  lead to  anymajor miscues  in  the  estimates,  but  there  is  still  a potential problemfor  the  estimates.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any  further  questions  from  anyone?  Ifnot, who would  like  to  start  the  roundtable?  President  Hoenig.11/15/95-21-

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Tenth Federal  Reserve Districtcontinues to  be  relatively strong.  Since  the  last  meeting,  forexample, payroll  employment  in our  District  continued  to  grow fasterthan  the national  average.  District manufacturers  continue  to  operateat  or near  full  capacity.  In  recent  surveys, many of  them suggestthat  their  operations have pretty much rebounded  from the  summerslowdowns.  In addition,  retail  sales  have  been solid throughout  theDistrict  and most  of  the retailers we  have  talked to  expect  a goodholiday season.  Our directors  are  reporting that  commercialconstruction  activity continues  to be  fairly brisk, offsetting a bitof  a  slowdown  in home  building.  Reflecting the  generally healthy toneof  the  economy in  our District,  growth  in bank credit  has picked uprecently, supported by gains  in consumer  and real  estate  lending.While  our  economy  is  generally stronger,  there  are a couple  of  areasthat  have  shown some  weakness:  energy  and agriculture.  Low oil  pricescontinue  to  hold down activity  in  the  District's  energy  industry, andfinancial  losses  in  the  District's  cattle  industry are  likely to  limitthe  improvement in  farm  incomes,  which  some  of  us  were expecting.Wage  and price pressures  remain  relatively subdued despite  the  overallstrength of  our regional  economy and despite  some  spotty reports  ofwage pressures  at  the  lower  end of  the wage  scale.On  the national  level,  the  outlook in  my opinion  remainsfavorable.  By that  I mean  that,  on  the  real  side,  I am  looking forgrowth  to  be  about  2-1/4  percent  over  the next  several quarters.While  I note the  strength  in  the  third  quarter,  I see  economicactivity returning  to  this  more moderate pace  as  we move  through  thisquarter  into  next  year.  But  even with  this  slowing,  the  economyremains  fundamentally  strong  in my view,  except  for  governmentspending and  inventory investment.  I expect most  other sectors  tocontribute  to  growth  over  the  next  several  quarters.  A  growth rate  ina 2  to  2-1/4  percent  range  is  entirely appropriate, I think.  This  isespecially true with  the  economy continuing  to  operate a bit beyondcapacity, by most measures  at  least.  With regard  to  inflation,  Ibelieve  that  we need  to  continue  to  be  cautious.  I'm pleased withsome  of  the more  favorable  inflation numbers.  But  despite  thismorning's  report,  I think  it  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  core  CPIinflation  is  likely to  rise  this  year  over  last,  and with resource usestill  at  fairly  high  levels,  wherever one  believes  the NAIRU is,  weare  not  likely to  see  a real  easing  in  inflation below that  3 percentproceed  from here.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Conditions  in  theSoutheast,  in  the  Sixth District, have  not  changed very much  since  thelast  meeting.  We  continue  to  enjoy moderate  economic  growth  in mostsectors  and relatively  low inflation.  It  is  interesting  to  note  thatthe  economy  in  the  Southeast,  and I think this  is  generally  true  ofthe  nation, has  made a  successful  transition  from  the  rapid growth  inthe  first  three years  of  the  current  expansion to  the more moderategrowth  that  we have  experienced  this  year.Looking at  some  particular  sectors,  we  have  seen a rebound  inhousehold spending  in  early November  after some  special  factors,including Hurricane  Opal,  had  depressed retail  sales  in  October.  Inspite of  this  rebound,  extensive holiday  sales promotions  have  already11/15/95-22-begun  that  will  extend  the holiday  shopping  season by at  least  severalweeks.  I have  seen  some reports  in  the  last  few  days  indicating  thatretailers  in  the Southeast  are  expecting  sales  to  be 7 percent abovelast  year's,  which I think  is  a  little better  than what  is  reportedgenerally  in  the nation.  In  the Atlanta  area,  they are  expectingabout an  8 percent  increase,  which is  really  quite  good.  It  remainsto  be  seen whether  they will  achieve  those  or not.  Sales  of  consumerdurables  other than  autos  have  strengthened recently along with thesecond wave  of  home building.  In  the  real  estate  area,  activity  inresidential markets  has  been stimulated by recent declines  in mortgagerates.  Nashville  and Atlanta remain  the  strongest markets, but  otherSoutheast metropolitan areas  also have had quite  good growth relativeto  last  year.  In  the multifamily  sector, demand is  really strong,  andit  is  not uncommon to  see  ninety percent  occupancy  rates  in  thatDistrict  and speculative office  and  retail developments  are regularlyreported now.  In manufacturing, our regional  manufacturers'  surveyindicates  that  the pace  of  growth  in the  Southeast  has  slowed somewhatsince  July, and  that  survey  includes  housing-related manufacturing  andauto  production, which had  been strong previously.  The  same  surveycontinues  to  show quite modest  pressures  on prices  at  both the  inputand  final  product  levels,  and the  expectations are  for  little  changein such prices.  The  Southeast,  and especially Atlanta,  areexperiencing  growth  in  tourism  in both  traffic  and revenue.  TheOlympics  are  guaranteeing a draw of  about  2 to  3 million visitors  nextsummer, which  is  expected to  spill  over  into  each  of  the  Districtstates  in  one  form or another.  So,  the  outlook  for  the  Southeastcontinues  to  be  quite good  on both  the  output  side  and  in  terms  ofprices.With  respect  to  the  national economy,  for  the  first  time  thatI can  remember, our  forecast  and  the Greenbook  forecast  are about  thesame.  Both forecasts  agree  that  the  4.2  percent  real  growth  of  thethird quarter is  unsustainable.  Our  forecast  shows  real  growth  in  the2-1/4  to  3 percent  range  quarterly through  1997  and  inflation  in  the2-1/2  to  3 percent  range  quarterly.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  economic  growth  in  the  TwelfthFederal  Reserve  District  has  accelerated  through  September.  RecentCalifornia employment  growth  has been  significantly  faster  than  forthe  United States  as  a whole.  Very  rapid growth  has continued  in Utahand Oregon.  Although Nevada and Arizona  show  signs  of  cooling,  theyare  growing very  rapidly.  Idaho  and Washington  also  are  growing morerapidly than  the United  States as  a whole, but with  some  areas  ofweakness.  The  limited information  that  we  have  on activity  in Octobersuggests  less  robust  economic  expansion.  The  official  Californiaemployment and unemployment  figures  for  October  suggest  some  slowing,although other  state  data  indicate that  the  recovery  is  still  ontrack.  Boeing's  23,000  machinists  located in  the  state  of Washingtonare continuing  a strike  that  was  begun  in early  October;  the  strike  islikely  to  pull  down overall  economic  activity  in  that  state  in  thefourth  quarter.  I might  note parenthetically, as  you may have  seen,that  Boeing received an  incredibly  large  order  from Singapore Airlinesfor  their new 777.  In  California,  there  is  an ongoing debate  overcreation of  higher paying  jobs  versus  lower  paying  jobs  during  thestate's  prolonged recession.  During  this  period,  the  shift  from11/15/95-23-higher to  lower wage  industries  has  been more rapid  in  California thanin  the nation as  a whole  due primarily to  large reductions  in defense-related employment.  More  recently, we believe  that  this  trend hasbeen reversed,  due largely  to  job creation  in  high-tech-relatedsectors  since  those  sectors have  been growing very  rapidly in  the  lastyear or  so.Turning  to  the national  outlook,  our forecast  shows  real  GDPgrowth averaging  about  2-1/2  percent  or  somewhat more  through  the  endof  next year.  In  our  view this  would  leave  the  economy with  someresource constraints  in  labor  and product markets  even  if  the  NAIRUhas  fallen a bit.  Recent  inflation news,  as  we  all  know, has  beenfavorable.  Although  I hope  it  continues  in  this  vein,  it  seems  to  methere are  some reasons  to worry about whether  that  will happen.First,  there  will be  upward pressure  on  inflation to  the extent  thatthe economy  is  pressing on  full  employment.  Second,  I believe thereare  reasons  to  be  skeptical  of  arguments  that  the moderation  inemployment  cost  inflation over  the past year will  be  a major  factorholding down price  inflation for  long.  As  was mentioned by Mike,  mostof  the  slowdown  in the  employment  cost  index since  1993  has  been  inbenefits,  especially health care  costs.  This  has  caused  employmentcosts  to  decelerate  since mid-1994.  However,  in  the  long  run  thisshould  affect only  the  level  of  benefit  costs  with presumably nopermanent  effect  on  compensation  inflation.  Second, research at  ourBank and  in  the  academic  literature--and  I would cite  here work  doneby Robert  Gordon and also Yash Mehra from  the  Richmond Bank--questionsthe direction  of  causation between  wages  and prices.  We don't  talkabout  that  very much.  This work  suggests  that  more often  than  not,these  two variables  are  brought  into  alignment  by wages  adjusting toprices  rather  than  the  other way around.  So,  despite  the  favorableCPI  numbers  in recent months,  the unusual  decline  of  labor  costinflation relative  to price  inflation during  the past  year  or  morecould be  resolved in  large part  by somewhat  faster wage  inflation  inthe  future.  In  this  regard,  I found the  Greenbook projection  ofrising  labor  costs  in  1996  and  1997  certainly plausible.  Taking thesefactors into  account,  I end up  concluding, as  did Tom Hoenig,  that  Idon't see  us making any progress  in  1996  and  1997  in  reducinginflation below this  year's  rate.  Under  the  assumption  of  a roughlyconstant  funds  rate,  our  forecast  shows  the  CPI  at  around  3 percent  in1996  and 1997,  a little  above  this  year's  2-3/4  percent  rate.  Thankyou.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Sometimes  the  District  reports  make  me  thinkabout  12  pistons  in  a  reciprocating engine,  with some  rising and  somefalling.  It's  hard to  cut  through  it  and know whether  the engine  iswell  tuned  and humming along  or  not.  The  Fourth  District  isdefinitely a piston  that  is  coming  down.  I've  been struck by howconsistently the  reports  from our  Bank's  business  advisory council,our  directors,  and the  other people  that we have  talked to  have  beenin  the negative direction  since our meeting  in  September.  People arepulling down  their  expectations,  not  only  to  finish out  this  year butalso  for  the  first  half  of  next  year.  It  may simply be  because  theDistrict  is  so  heavily  influenced by automobiles.  Our manufacturingemployment  as  a share  of  total  employment  is  running about  twice  thenational  average  so  that  when autos  and  trucks and  even agriculturalequipment  soften--and they are  distinctly  softening--everything  else11/15/95-24-and everyone's  attitudes also  downshift.  That's  pretty uniformthroughout  the  District with the  exception  of  the  area  aroundLexington and  the Georgetown automobile  facility  that  is  stillexpanding.  Everyone  else  is  reporting  that  it  is  much  easier  to  hirethan before.  Their  order books  are  softening;  their backlogs  aredown.  There  are almost no  reports  of  the  type  we were hearing  for  awhile about  commodity prices  of  various  types  being  the  source  of  newinflation.  Other  than some  pickup  in  residential  construction aroundthe District--and people  say they  think that  is  related to  lowermortgage  rates--we  see people  mostly pulling back  on  the previousoptimism.I worry about  these  kinds  of  anecdotal  reports  adding up  overtime  to  the mirror  image  of  two years ago when we  started to  sensethat  the  head winds were dissipating.  In  terms  of  the  things  that weare concerned  about,  that  kind  of  information we  have  about realeconomic  activity translated  for me  into  saying  in the  context  of  twoyears  ago  that  the  real  equilibrium  interest  rate was  starting  toshift up.  If  we don't make some  adjustment, we will wind up with a defacto  easing  of  policy  relative  to where  we  think it  ought  to be.If  I am right  about  things  going  in  the  opposite  direction  oftwo  years ago,  we  should  start  to  see  a pattern of  people  beingsurprised  that  the  economic  indicators are  coming  in weaker  than theypreviously had  expected.  We are  hearing  it  not only  in  consumer goodsbut  also  in  capital  spending.  I would call  that  a downward revisionin  the equilibrium  real  rate.  We would be  in a posture  of  winding upwith a more  restrictive policy  relative  to  what  is  going on  in  theeconomy  than we  may later  consider  to  have been appropriate.  I don'tmake  forecasts  anymore,  but  I do  listen  to  the  forecasts  of my  staff.They  tell me  with a  fair  degree  of  confidence  that  real  GDP  growththis  quarter will  come  in somewhere  between minus  1 and plus  5percent.  [Laughter]  I'm  not  sure what  to  make of  it,  wherever  itfalls  in  that  range.  But  looking  to  next year,  I am very troubled bythat  persistent 3 percent  inflation  rate  shown  in  the Greenbook.  Ifthat's  the most  likely outcome,  in  the  sense  of  being consistent withthe  forecast  of  economic  activity and  the  assumed  stance  of  policy,then  it's  unacceptable.  But  I don't  have any basis  for  saying  thatit's  wrong and  that  it's  too  high.  If  I were  still  in  the game  ofmaking  forecasts,  I would tell  people  that  it  is  more  likely  to  comein below those  numbers  than  above  those  numbers.

Manufacturing continues  to  grow, although  thepace appears  to  be waning.  Retailers  are disappointed with sales  andconcerned about  the  outlook  for holiday  sales.  Even  discount  storesare  now seeing smaller  increases  than earlier  in  the  year.  Auto  saleshave  eased with  the  end  of  incentive  programs  on  '95  models  and  slowdeliveries  of  '96  models.  Real  estate  activity has  been running  at anearly  level  rate.  Office vacancy rates  are  coming down  only slowlyif  at all,  and residential  sales  are  flat.  Commercial  and industriallending  is  moving up some,  with a slowing  of  credit  card lending.Employment  gains  are  anemic but  still  better  than  earlier  in  the  year,and wage  gains  continue  to  be  in  the  3 to  4 percent  range.  Attitudesappear  to  be  more cautious  than upbeat.11/15/95Turning  to  the national  economy,  it  just  does  not have  thefeel  of  a  4 to  5 percent  growth  rate.  The  statistics  appear  to  betelling us  a relatively  fast  growth  story,  and the  anecdotalinformation  indicates  a more moderate growth  story.  I'm inclined  togive  more weight  to  the  anecdotal  evidence.  Consumer  spending  appearsmore consistent  with  the more moderate growth path,  as  doesmanufacturing.  I would view the  4 to  5 percent  growth  that we  seem  tohave had as  more  of  a statistical  aberration than a basic underlyingtrend.  The outlook  for  inflation  is  probably  in  the  3 percent  rangefor next  year.  While  I believe we  are  all  committed over  time  to  astable price  environment, I think we have  to  be  realistic  about  this.We  are in  a very mature phase  of  the  business  cycle and  it would be  amajor accomplishment by  historical  standards  just  to  keep  inflationfrom rising  at  this  point  in  the  cycle.  I think  there will  beopportunities  to  have  further  disinflation, but my expectation  is  thatwe  will  have  to wait  for  a more  conducive phase  of  the business  cyclefor  that  to be  achieved.

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr.  Chairman,  on balance,  the  Seventh District'seconomy  is  performing  at  a very high  level,  generally  stronger  thanthe national  economy and with some  sectors  or  industries  at  or  nearcapacity.  The  District's manufacturing  sector expanded  in  October,while manufacturing  contracted nationally.  The purchasing  managers'surveys  from across  the District  in  Chicago, Milwaukee,  Detroit  andwestern Michigan all  indicated  expansion in  October,  while  thenational  figure dropped below 50.  However,  there  are  some  areas  inmanufacturing where  I think caution seems  to  be  called for.  I saythis  recognizing  that  our manufacturing firms  are now operating  atvery high  levels.  In my view our  situation  is  not  the  same  as  the  oneJerry Jordan described  for  the  Cleveland District,  where he  said  thatgrowth  actually is  starting to  decline, but  there are  areas  in  ourDistrict  that  we  have  to  watch  carefully.One  area  is  light motor vehicles.  October  sales  of  suchvehicles  were below September's,  and our  contacts  indicate  that  salesin early November have  not  shown any significant  improvement  so  far.Of  course,  this  is  the  early part of  the month,  but without  a pickupfrom  the recent  sales pace,  it's  highly  likely  that  production planswill  be trimmed  further  this  quarter.  Medium-  and heavy-duty trucksis  another  area where  caution seems  appropriate.  Net  orders haveproduction  this  quarter  as  much as  might be  expected.  Althoughinventories will  be  increasing, several  manufacturers  indicate  theywill  wait  for  the  new year before reassessing  their production plans.Finally,  the  steel  industry  needs careful  monitoring.  Steelproduction  in  our  District  has  been  at  very high  levels,  but  spotprices  for  steel  have  been dropping  sharply.District  retailers  generally were pleasantly  surprised withthe  early November  sales  gains,  particularly after  October'slackluster performance.  However, retailers  are  still  in  a gloomymood,  in  part  because  of  weak catalogue  sales,  and they  are  boostingsales  promotions.  Retailers with a national  presence  noted  that  salesat  stores  located  in  our District  generally were  stronger  thannationally.  A note  of  caution,  however:  A  large  national  truckingfirm reported  that  large  discounters  were  significantly  slower  in11/15/95-26-taking  holiday  shipments  this  year as  compared with previous  years.The housing sector  in our  District  is  very  strong.  New and used homesales  in  the Midwest  led  the United  States  in September  and October.Builders  in Chicago  and western Michigan are  struggling to  keep upwith  demand.Labor markets  remain  tight.  Unemployment  rates  in ourDistrict  range between  3.3  and  4.8  percent.  We  are  now receiving morereports  of  rising wage pressures,  especially  for  low skill  entry-leveljobs.  But  these  increases  do not  yet appear  in  the  data,  as  a  third-quarter  employment  cost  index for  the Midwest  was  roughly  in  line  withthe nation.  We have  received an advanced  copy of  ManpowerIncorporated's  first-quarter  1996  hiring plans  survey  results,  whichwill  not be publicly available  until  early December.  The nationalresults  indicate  that  business  hiring plans  for  the  first  quarter  of1996  will  remain  at  the  high levels  reported for  both the  thirdquarter and  the  fourth quarter  of  this  year.  Hiring plans  for Midwestfirms  continue to  be  stronger  than the  national  survey  results.  Ourcontacts  at that  they  feel  the  first-quarter resultsgenerally  tend to  be  a good indicator  for  the  full  year.  They alsoindicated  that wage  pressures were  very low, but  firms  they serviceare  expecting  increases  to  become  larger next  year.One  of  the major  developments  in the  agricultural  area,  ofcourse,  has  been the  sharp  increase  in grain prices:  Wheat  prices  arethe highest  in  twenty-one years  and corn  prices  are  the  highest  ineleven years;  a year  ago,  corn  prices  hit  a seven-year  low.  While  itis  not entirely  clear how much  food prices  will  be  affected, the  farmprice  increases  this  year  have  been bullish for  suppliers  of  farmequipment.  More  generally, price  patterns  in our  District  do not  seemto  have  changed much  since  our  last  meeting.  Nonagriculturalcommodity prices  continue  to  be soft.  Paper  board, gypsum, and  steelscrap prices  have  all  edged down.Turning  to  the national picture,  our  outlook  is  broadly  inline with  the  Greenbook.  We  generally agree  with  the Greenbook'sassessment  for  fourth-quarter  GDP growth  in  inventories,  although theanecdotal  information we  are receiving  points  to  further  inventorycorrection early next  year.  Our  overall  forecast  is  for  a bit  moreeconomic  growth  next year  than  the  Greenbook, and we  are  slightly moreoptimistic  on  inflation,  but  the  differences  are  not really  large.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

MR. STERN.  Thank you.  We  recently have had meetings withour  directors  and our  advisory council,  and  several  themes  emergedfrom those  discussions.  Many of  them are  not new, but  I think  theyare  worth  emphasizing because  they were universal.  The  first  of  thesethemes  was  that  labor markets  are very, very tight  across  the  Districtand across  skill  and experience  levels--everything  from unskilled,inexperienced workers  to  college  graduates, MBAs,  and  so  on.  Whilethat was  reported by virtually everybody who  commented  on  it,  theyalso  commented  that  despite  the  fact  that  those  labor  markets havebeen  tight  for  quite  some  time,  there  is  no  real  sign  of  anyacceleration  in  wage  increases  or price  increases  across  the  District.Also,  credit  is  readily  available.  There  has  been a  striking  lack ofreports  of  difficulty  in  finding  credit.  Real  estate  construction11/15/95-27-manufacturing sector,  in  contrast,  is  pretty sluggish outside  of  thepaper  industry.  If  there  is  one  group that  is  concerned about  currentindustry conditions  and where  the  economy  is  likely  to  be  going,  Iwould have  to  say  it  is  the manufacturers.  Those we  have  talked  towho do business  internationally say that  outside  of  Japan  they areseeing  improved business.  Japan  appears  to  be,  as  we  know,  largely acase unto  itself at  the  moment.  Finally,  those who  commented  on  thisissue  indicated that  capital  spending today  is  being  driven  bytechnological  change rather  than  interest rates.  They would not  arguethat  interest rates  are  altogether  inconsequential, but  they  seem tofeel  that  they really  have  to  continue  to  introduce  new technology inorder to  remain  competitive.With regard  to  the  outlook  for  the  national  economy, I  sharethe view evidenced  in  the Greenbook  that  we will  see  a continuation ofrespectable  real  growth  from here.  It  will  not be  at  the pace  of  thethird quarter, but  I don't see  any reason  to  doubt  that  the  economywill  continue to  grow at  a pace  in  the neighborhood of  2 or  3 percenton  average over  the  next  several  quarters.  With regard  to  theinflation outlook,  I must  admit  to  a fair  amount of  uncertainty.  If  Ihad  to write  down  a number,  I would probably write down something  likethe  3 percent  in  the  Greenbook.  But  if  there  is  one  thing that  reallyhas  surprised me  in  the past year or maybe two,  it  has  been  the  factthat  despite  tight  labor markets,  rapid growth  in demand,  and  tightproduct markets we  have  not  seen any acceleration  of  inflation.  Ihave  a tinge  of  optimism  regarding  the  inflation outlook,  and  if  Iwere  to  err  I would guess  that  we  might  do  a bit better  on  theinflation side  than that  number  I would write  down.

MS.  MINEHAN.  Mr. Chairman,  New England  continues  its  gradualexpansion  from the  trough of  the  recession, but recent  data  suggestthat  even  the moderate growth  pace of  earlier  this year has  slowed  abit.  As  usual  there  is  good news  and bad news--or at  least  downbeatnews.  Let  me  cover  the  downbeat  first and  finish on  a more hopefulnote.During  the  first  eight  months  of  1995,  New England added  jobsat  only about  a third  the pace of  the prior  two years.  National  jobgrowth has  slowed  in  recent months, but  New England's  decline has  beensharper.  The  region had been adding  jobs  at  about  two-thirds  thenational pace  since  the  recession  ended, but  recent  data  show  that  ourjob  growth  has  slowed  to  about  half  the pace  for  the  nation as  awhole.  Among  the  states,  Rhode  Island maintains  its  ranking  as  thebasket  case,  with employment  continuing  to be  below  that  of  the yearbefore.  Connecticut  is  barely growing  at  all,  while  the  remainingstates  have  had, at  least  in New England terms,  relatively healthy  jobgrowth.  Manufacturing  employment  continues  to  shrink, but  the  pace ofcontraction  has  slowed  a bit.  The  cause of  the  recent  regionalemployment  slowdown therefore  lies  outside manufacturing;  employmentgrowth  in  finance,  government, and  transportation has  come  to  arelative  standstill.  I should note  that  despite  the  trend to  smallergovernment,  the  share  of  government  in the  employment  pie  in  NewEngland  is  expected  to  grow.  This  is  because  the  Bureau  of  LaborStatistics  now classifies  Indian-run  casinos  as  "other localgovernment."  [Laughter]  One wonders  about  this!  Without  casino-related  job  growth, Connecticut  clearly would have  continued  to  be  our11/15/95-28-basket  case,  because  that  is  where most of  Connecticut's  job growthhas  come  from.  Despite  this,  unemployment  remains  relatively  low inNew England  at  least  in part  because  of  weak labor  force  growth andoutmigration.  Recent  estimates  show that  the  labor  force  actually hasshrunk by about  200,000  since  the  recession  ended while  the  number  ofestablishment  jobs  has  expanded by about  325,000.  We  maintain  ashrinking.  Adding  to  the  downbeat news  from  local  labor markets  isconsiderable  softness  in  retail  sales.  This  undoubtedly reflects weakconsumer  confidence,  which  is  below year-earlier  levels.Now to  turn  to  a little  hope:  There are  bright  spots  in NewEngland.  High-tech businesses are booming, at  least  certain  kinds  ofhigh-tech businesses.  So  much so  that  one  contact  said  his  companywas  constrained not  by demand but by  a relative  shortage  of  siliconwafers  and glass  yarn.  Software designers  are  in  short  supply,  andthe  industry  itself  is  beginning  to  regard 25  to  30  percent growthrates  as  disappointing.  A  contact  at  a major software  company  locatedboth  in  California  and New England  said he  will  be moving  some  jobs  toMassachusetts  because  shortages are  even worse  in California.  Wagesfor  these  workers  have risen only a modest  4  to  5 percent,  however,due  in  large  part  to  the value  of  stock  incentive programs  that  arebeing used increasingly to  reward highly paid workers.  Tourism  hasbeen  another bright  spot,  with significant  gains  over  even  last  year'sstrong performance.Finally,  I don't know  if  this  is  hopeful  or not,  but  loangrowth at  large  District banks  has  slowed  considerably from  itsearlier pace.  It  had been slower  than  for  the nation  as  a wholethroughout  the  recovery.  Most  of  this  weakness  lies  in  commercial  andindustrial  loans,  and some  of  this  is  due  to  uneasiness  about  largebank mergers,  which we  think  have redirected  some  business  to  smallerbanks  in  the District.Turning  to  the  national  scene,  we had  a rather  healthyinternal  debate  among  the  economists  on my  staff.  It's  a  seriousdebate  because  I gather money has been wagered  on what  the  directionof  the  Committee's  next move  ought  to  be,  up  or  down.  The  fact  thatwe can make  good  arguments  for  both positions,  I think,  underscoresthe  Bank's general  agreement with the  Greenbook  forecast.  As  I seeit,  that  forecast  shows  a  fairly good  outcome with relatively balancedrisks.  Actually,  it  was  a bit  more upbeat  than  I had expected,possibly because  the  third-quarter  numbers  have  been  such  a  surprise.In  that  regard,  I think that  the  foreign growth  numbers  projected bythe  staff  may be  overly optimistic,  and  I really don't  know what  tobelieve  about  the  numbers  associated with the  federal  budget  crisis.Your  crystal  ball  is  probably as  good as  any on  that  one.  On theother hand,  I really do  think  that  the  impetus  provided by  lowinterest  rates  and booming financial  markets,  combined with where weare  in  terms  of  the unemployment  rate,  does play  out  in  the  directionof  an  upside  risk,  and  I would buy  into  a  few  of  the  concerns  thatPresident  Parry mentioned  in  his comments.  I am  concerned  that we  maynot  continue  to  be successful  in  keeping  inflation  at  the  projected 3percent  rate.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Mr.  Chairman, may  I interrupt  a second?  SecretaryRubin announced  a  little  less  than  a half  hour  ago  that  he  isdisinvesting  trust  funds,  in  particular  the  Civil  Service  Retirement11/15/95-29-Fund as  well  as  the  G-fund, by enough  to  permit  the  Treasury to  raisesome  $60  billion  in  the  market.  This  now gets  them  up  to  the  lastbusiness  day of  December.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Did he  say that  or  is  it  our  estimate?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  I believe  he  said  the  $60  billion would  get  theTreasury through  December 30.  He did  it  by using  the  $21-1/2  billionin the  G-fund as  everybody  expected.  But  apparently he must have madea  finding  that  this  crisis,  or  this  debt  limitation problem, could  goon  long  enough to  enable  him  to  disinvest about  $39  billion  of  theCivil  Service  retirement  fund.  This  suggests  that  he  found  it  mightgo  for  about  a year  or  so.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Couldn't  that  announcement  in  itself  have  theimpact  of  slowing  down progress  in  resolving  the  budget problem?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  In  the  last  few  days,  attention  appears  to  haveshifted to  the  appropriations  process and  the  debt  ceiling  issue  hascome off  the  table.  There was  some  presumption  that  the  Secretary hadenough  tricks  in  his  bag  to  keep  it  off  the  table  for  a while.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr.  Chairman, Part  II  of  the  Greenbook  startsout  with  the  statement  that  the  recent news  on  the national  economy  isunusually  "conflictive."  I wasn't  sure  that  was  a word, so  I lookedit  up and  as  always  the  staff was  right.  It  is  a word and it  is  agood word!  [Laughter]  It  is  a good word to  describe conditions  inour  District  as  well  as  in  the  country as  a whole.  I will  cite  acouple  of examples.  Furniture,  as  most  of  you  probably know,  is  amajor  industry in  our  region,  and each  fall  there  is  a so-called"furniture market"  in  High Point,  North  Carolina where  all  the majormanufacturers  and a number  of  major  retailers  come  together.  Thatfive  years.  In  sharp  contrast,  the CEO  of  a sizable  chain of  retailfurniture  stores  said  that  his  business had picked up  significantly inrecent weeks.  Elsewhere,  textile  and apparel  manufacturers  tell  usthat  conditions  in  their  industries have  softened a great  deal  lately.At  the  same  time,  there  are pockets  of  substantial  strength  throughoutthe  District  in  such diverse  activities  as  chemical manufacturing  inWest  Virginia,  the  expansion of  high-tech  facilities  in  Virginia andNorth Carolina,  and tourism  in  South  Carolina.  Commercialconstruction is  said  to  be  quite  strong throughout  the  District.  Autosales  have  softened in  some places  but are much  stronger  in  otherplaces.  So  again,  "conflictive" seems  to  be  a good word  to describethe  kind of  reports  and  information we  have been  getting recently.Boiling  it  all  down, my  sense  is  that  in  the  aggregateconditions  in  our  District  have not  really changed a great  deal  sincethe  last  FOMC meeting.  I think steady growth  at  a moderate pacecontinues  to  characterize  our  regional  economy.  However,  as  LarryLindsey reminded me  at  breakfast  this  morning, our District  is  more atrisk  than other  parts  of  the country  to  any  near-term shock  stemmingfrom the  current  fiscal  situation;  our  region would bear  adisproportionate  share  of  such  a shock.  One  other point  that might  beworth mentioning about  our  region--it  might  extend beyond the  region--was brought  up  at  a  joint meeting of  all  three  of  our boards  last11/15/95-30-week.  Chairman Greenspan was  there.  At  that meeting,  several  bankersexpressed  the view  that  loan  quality was  deteriorating  in  our regionand around the  country and  that  loan margins  generally had narrowedand competitive pressures  had  intensified.  Six  or  seven bankers madethat  sort of  comment  and  only one  took  exception  to  it.With respect  to  the national  economy, I have  to  admit  that  Iwas  a bit  surprised by the  magnitude  of  the  upward revision  in  theforecast.  I have  been reading  these  Greenbooks  for a  long  time,  andthis was  a significant  upward revision,  especially if  a  comparison  ismade with  the previous  forecast  in  some  of  the out-quarters.  I thinkthe  level  of  real  GDP at  the  end  of  1996  is  about  a percent  higherthan  it  was  in  the September  Greenbook.  I recognize  that  with  themore  recent retail  sales  figures  you may revise your  forecast  down  abit,  Mike, but  I take  it  that on  net  it  is  going  to be  generally thesame  picture.  The Greenbook makes  a good case  for  that  revision.Aggregate  demand does  appear  to  be  significantly  stronger  than wethought  it  was  not too  many weeks  ago.  Business  investment,especially in  computing  equipment but  in a lot  of  other  things  aswell,  is  still  quite robust.  There  is  still  a lot  of  thrust  inhousing, and we  certainly see  that  in much of  our  District.  Thelatest  labor market  reports,  as  the  Greenbook mentions,  suggest  thatincome will  be  growing rapidly  enough  to  sustain  at  least  moderategrowth  in  consumer  spending  in  the  period ahead.  Clearly, none ofthis  negates  the  downside  risks  that  are  still  there,  and  I think  theretail  sales  report yesterday was  a good reminder  of  that.  But  itdoes  suggest  that  the  risks  on  the  up  side  are  also  there  and theyshould not be  ignored.This  brings  me to  what  seems  to  be  the main  implication ofthe  revision.  It  moves  the projected path of  the  economy away  fromone  that  might  have  seemed  to  be  a bit below  the  economy's potentialto a path that may be very  close  to potential  and conceivably even  alittle above  it.  This  obviously has  implications  for  the  inflationoutlook, and  I think  they  show up  in  the projections.  They are  notdramatic,  but  they are  there  if  you  look at  the  numbers  closely.  Inparticular,  as  I recall,  the  September  Greenbook  showed  the  core CPIinflation rate  gradually declining over  the  course  of  the  projectionperiod.  In this  Greenbook,  it  stays  almost  exactly  constant at  3percent.  Some  people might  look  on  that  as  an  optimistic  forecast,but  I think  it  is  a move  in a direction  that we  don't want  to  see.Tom Hoenig  and Bob  Parry have made  this  point before.  I  think weshould be  concerned  if  we  see no  further progress  toward  pricestability until  1998  at  the  earliest.  And,  obviously, with  therevision in  the projection, there  is  some  risk  that  we  could get  intoa situation where  the  inflation  rate  begins  to  drift  slowly upward.That  prospect  should  be  a concern  and  it  is  what  struck me most  in  theprojections.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Mike,  I was  interested in your comment  that  thecurrent  situation reminded  you most  of developments  in  the  late  1980s.I wasn't here  then.  What  I remember about  1988-89  is  the  cover  ofBusiness Week  that  asked  "Have we  repealed the  business  cycle?"  If  Iwere  to  put  a cover  on  this  Greenbook,  I too would  say  "Have werepealed the  business  cycle?"  At  the  least,  your  forecast puts  offany perceptible  slowing  for  another  six  quarters--until  mid-1997.  I'm11/15/95-31-suspicious  of  that.  I hope  I'm wrong, but  I have a number  ofquibbles,  particularly on  the  international  side,  and  one majorconcern that  has  to  do with  the  consumer  debt  situation.  We  continueto  have  a robust  forecast  and robust debt  growth.  The  Greenbookrightly notes  that  consumer debt  levels  have moved up.  In  the  last2-1/2  years,  consumer debt  as  a percent  of  disposable  personal  incomehas  risen 2-1/2  percentage points  from  about  16  percent  to  about18-1/2 percent.  One  way  of  looking  at  that  is  that  40  percent  ofgrowth  in  PCE  in  the  last  2-1/2  years  has  been  financed by higher non-housing consumer  debt.  The reason  I am more  concerned  about  that  thanthe  Greenbook and the  reason  that  we  are  going  to  have  some  problemsis  two-fold:  first,  I think that  the  quality of  income  that  consumersare  receiving makes  that  debt  level  worse  than  what  it  is  perceived tobe;  and, second,  there  is  the view  that  the  stock market  can be  apanacea  for  the deterioration  on  the  liability  side.  I don't believethat  is  accurate.Let me  start  with  the  income  situation.  Although personalincome has been rising  at  a respectable rate,  not  all personal  incomeflows  through to  spendable  income  for  the consumer.  Although  that  istrue  for wages,  that  is  not  true  for  substantial portions  of  interestand dividends.  One  check on  that  is  simply  to  look at  income  taxdata.  Now, if  you receive  more  than  ten dollars  a year  in  eitherinterest  or  dividend payments,  that  income  is  reported to  the  IRS.So,  it  is  not  a question  of  evasion;  any received  interest  or  dividendincome by a taxable  entity  is  going  to  show up  in  the income  tax data.Yet,  only 30  percent of  personal  interest  income  is  reported on  incometax  returns.  That  includes  nontaxed  interest.  The same  thing  is  truefor  50  percent  of  dividends and  65  percent  of  business  income.  If  youdefine  spendable  income,  you  can either  include  transfers  or  notinclude  transfers.  The numbers  I have don't  include  transfers,  butthat  doesn't  change  the  story.  What  you  get  is  a picture  of  theincome  situation  that  suggests  there  is  a lot  less  spendable  incomeout  there  than what  we have perceived.  By itself  that  is  not  adisturbing  fact.  What  is  disturbing  is  that  over  time  therelationship between  spendable  income and disposable  personal  incomehas  been deteriorating.  For example,  spendable  income  in  1988,  as  Ijust  defined  it  adjusting  for what  actually flows  through  to  householdchecking accounts,  amounted to  about  61  percent  of  disposable personalincome.  In  1995,  that  fell  to  57.4  percent.  So  we  have had  roughly  a6 percent  decline  in  the  base,  what  I would call  the denominator,which we  should be using  to  measure  debt  service  burdens.  That meansthat  the  18-1/2  percent  that  we  scored  in  the  second quarter  of  thisyear has  a  ratio  of  debt  to  disposable personal  income  that,  afteradjusting  for  the  deterioration  in  the  composition  of  income,  wouldreally be  a number  like  19.7  percent.  That would be  a record highsubstantially above  anything  that we  have  seen.  Obviously, with theaverage  of  spendable  income  to  disposable personal  income  falling,  itis  even worse  at  the margin, and  the  last  year  has  been  the worst yearto  date.The  second  issue  is  whether  the  very substantial  stock marketgains  could  in  fact  offset  this  deterioration on  the householdliability  side.  It  is  an  obvious  statement  to  say that  people  who  ownstocks  are  the  same  people with  credit  card  debt.  But  if  you  take  acareful  look  at  the distribution of  stock market  wealth,  it  becomesincreasingly implausible  to  believe  that  a rise  in  stock market  wealthcould  actually be  the cause  of  any  kind of  sustained  expansion  in11/15/95consumer  spending.  For example,  31  percent of  dividends go  to  the  .8percent  of  households  at  the  top  of  the  income distribution and halfof  all  dividends  go  to  people  over  65.  Actually, among  the non  rich,substantially more than  half  of  all  dividends  go  to  people over  65.  Idon't  know if  we have  any detailed  studies  of  the marginal propensityto  consume,  but if  you  are  counting on  stock market  wealth, which  I'musing dividends  to  apportion, dividends  would be a  rough signal  that  alot  of  that  increase  in  stock market  wealth  is--I'm  going  to  use  theword--"wasted" on people  who are  unlikely  to  spend a large portion  ofit  and  certainly unlikely to  be  the  people who  are  running up  thisconsumer  debt.  To  try and probe  that  a little  further,  if  in  factstock market  wealth  is  going to  be  the  leading  cause  of  consumptionexpansion, we would expect  it  to permeate  down at  least  into  the$75,000  to  $100,000  income  class.  There  are  about  4 million house-holds  in  this  income range;  there  are about  4 million households  thatare  richer  than that.  We  are  talking  here about  the  92nd  to  96thpercentiles  of  household income.  If  we are  expecting a wealth-ledincrease in  consumption, they clearly  should benefit.  Yet half  of  allhouseholds  in  this  income  class  receive  no  dividends  at all,suggesting  that  they have  no  stock market  wealth.  And 71  percent  ofhouseholds  in  this  category under age  65  receive no  dividends  at  all,suggesting  that  they have  no  stock market  wealth.  Of  the  remaining 29percent  in  this  category--about  1 million households  that  receiveddividends--the  average  dividend  is  about  $3,000.  The median dividendis  about  $600.  If  you  figure  that  there was  a  40:1 price  to  dividendratio,  that  would mean  that  even  among  the  30  percent  of  thisrelatively wealthy class  that  got  dividends  and owned stock,  theirportfolio  is  only  about  $25,000.  The  gain in  their portfolio  was  onthe  order of  $6,000.  To  expect  that  small  a group  and that  small  again  to  somehow  sustain  consumption  spending  seems  implausible  to  me.So,  I have  to  believe  that  the problems  that  we  all  acknowledge  on  theliability side  of  the  household balance  sheet  are  real  and can't  beoffset by  improvements on  the  asset  side  of  the  household balancesheet.  I think this  is  going to  show up,  for  example,  in  continuingrecession, but  I  do  know that  this  type  of  increased risk  in  householdbalance  sheets  will mean  that whenever  there  is  a misstep--a  shock  ifyou will--in  some  other portion of  the  economy,  it  is  going  to  spillover  into  the  consumer  sector with magnified effects.  I think  thatmeans we have  substantially heightened risks  on  the down  side.  Thatis  my quarrel  with  the Greenbook.I would  like  to  say  one  other  thing  about  the  economy andthat  has  to  do  with  the  current budget  negotiations.  We  have  800,000federal  employees who  are  furloughed and  close  to  1-1/2  million whoare  not receiving paychecks.  Now,  that  is  a  lot  on  the  spending side.If  these people  are  actually  liquidity constrained,  it  is  in  effect  asudden  1-1/2  percent  rise  in  the unemployment  rate,  which would amendforecasts  about  what  is  going to  happen  to  consumer  spending,particularly  in the  fourth quarter.  Staff has  estimated  that  eachweek  that  we  continue  to  have  an  impasse  takes  .3 point  off  thefourth-quarter growth  rate.  Well,  it  looks  as  if  we  have one week  forsure  according  to  this  morning's papers  and, as  I read  the  rhetoric,  Idon't  see where  this  is  going to  end any  time  soon.  As  we  startadding up  the weeks  people  are  not  getting paychecks, we begin  to  geta  little nervous  about how  this might  spill  over.  Secondly,  if  it  isresolved,  the  direction  in which  it  most  likely will  be  resolved wouldbe  a compromise  on  the Medicare  side.  I  think that  would be11/15/95-33-unfortunate and  I believe  the bond markets  particularly would view itas  unfortunate.  It  would mean  that we would get  the  short-run cuts  onthe  discretionary  side,  that  is,  the  layoffs  in  the  government  sector.But  it  also  would signal  to  the bond markets  that  we are  not going  tobe  getting  our arms  around government consumption  over  the  long  haul.The  effect  of  that  would be  that yields  on  intermediate-  and  long-termsecurities would tend  to  rise.  The  big  rally in  securities marketshas not  come  from proposed cuts  in  funding  for  the National  Endowmentfor  the  Arts but  from proposed  cuts  in Medicare  and  long-termgovernment  consumption on  the order  of  a trillion  dollars.  So,  I amafraid  that  the  kind of  compromise  that  we most  likely  are headed  forwill  give us  the worst  of  both worlds--short-run  contraction in  1996due  to  layoffs  plus  a run-up  in  intermediate-  and long-term rates  thatwill  adversely affect  the  auto  industry and housing starts.  I amsubstantially more pessimistic  than  I was,  and I am much morepessimistic  than  the  Greenbook.

MR.  MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  The good news  is  that  this  year'sCPI  inflation  likely will  be  less  than  the members of  the  FOMCforecast  in  July.  The  acceleration  that was  widely expected at  thebeginning  of  the  year has not materialized.  Although  the  staffanalysis  cites  temporary decreases  in  energy  prices  and a decelerationin medical  care costs,  it  says  little about  the  contribution ofmonetary  factors.  Last  year's  slow growth  of  the  narrow and broadmonetary  aggregates  likely moderated  this  year's  inflation.  On  theother hand,  I don't  consider  the  current  stance  of  monetary policy  asbeing  unduly restrictive.  Growth  of  both  the  broad monetaryaggregates and bank  credit has  accelerated this  year.  If  we  adjustfor  sweep  accounts,  there  has  been  some  growth  in M1  as  well.  Inaddition,  firms  have  turned  to  the  capital  markets  for  financing  aslong-term market  yields  have  fallen  and stock prices  have  risen.The  bad news  is  that  neither  the  staff nor  the publicapparently sees  any deceleration of  inflation  in  sight.  Respondentsto  the  Philadelphia Fed  survey  expect  CPI  inflation to  accelerate  to3-1/2  percent  in  the  first  half  of  1996,  roughly  comparable  to  thestaff's projection  of  3.3  percent.  Households  in  the Michigan  surveyon average  expect  inflation  to  accelerate  to  about a  4 percent pacenext  year.  We  should be  concerned, I think, when  the public  expectsinflation to  accelerate  and not  to  fall  further  after  it  has  been heldbelow 3 percent  for  several years  in  a row.  It  is  true  thatexpectations  have  inched  down a bit;  we  can  see  that  in  long rates  andin some  of  the  surveys.  But  no  one  expects  inflation  to  fall  to  2percent  or  below anytime  soon.  We  simply do  not have  the  credibilitythat  at  least  I think  we  would like.  It  is  important  to protectrecent  gains  and  to make  further  progress  toward price  stability.  Atsome point,  a statement  in  that  regard with respect  to  our  intentionswould help.  It  is  a topic we have  talked about before.The  Eighth District economy,  like  the  nation's,  continues  tooperate  at  a high  level,  as  growth  slows  to  a sustainable rate.Transportation equipment  has been exceptionally strong.  Orders  forboth military  and civilian aircraft  have  increased.  District autoproduction  was up  34  percent  year-over-year during the  third  quarter,and  it  is  expected to  be  up  45  percent  during  the  fourth quarter.  Theexceptional  strength  in  St.  Louis  auto  production, as  I have mentioned11/15/95-34-before,  is  due  to  the particular  models  built  there,  mainly lighttrucks  and sports  utility vehicles.  In Arkansas,  Tennessee,  andKentucky,  the poultry industry  continues  to  expand  aggressively.Throughout  the  District, residential  construction  is  picking  up  andoffice vacancy rates  continue  to  decline.  There  are  some  signs  ofcyclical weakness,  however.  District  unemployment  rates,  althoughstill  low by historical  standards  and below national  averages,  haverisen  about  1/2  percentage point  on  average  over  the  last  year.Layoffs  at  large  corporations,  such as  General  Electric,  areattributed  to weak  domestic demand  for  appliances.  On  the  other  hand,announcements  of  plant  closings by  Brown Shoe  and Fruit of  the Loom,for  example, more  likely represent  structural adjustments  than  signsof  an  impending downturn.  In  the banking area,  "unchanged" is  the  keyword in  an Eighth  District  survey  of  senior  loan officers.  Loandemand has  leveled  off  after rising  sharply all  year.  In  fact,  atlarge  reporting banks,  loans  have  risen about  11  percent  over  the  lastyear.  Although  there has  been some  increase  in  the  consumer  loandelinquency rate,  it  remains  well  below the  level  attained  before  thelast  recession.  The poor weather  conditions  this  year have reducedcrops  and have  led  to  low agricultural  stocks,  a comment  that  Mike  inparticular made,  which may well  result  in markedly  higher  food pricesnext year.Nationally,  the economy  continues  to  operate  at  a high  level,with growth  slowing  to  its  10-year  average  rate.  It  is  important  notto  repeat  the mistakes  of  the past.  It  now seems  likely that  we  willget  through  this  business  cycle  with a peak of  inflation well  belowthe  6 percent  rate  that  occurred in  1990.  But,  frankly,  that  is  apretty  low  standard to  set  for  ourselves.  The  mistake made  inprevious business  cycles was  to  inflate  the money supply  in amisguided attempt  to  stimulate  growth.  In  every case,  fighting  thesubsequent  inflation contributed to  recession.  The  outlook for  thereal  economy  is  optimistic  today because  inflation has notaccelerated.  The worst  thing  we could do  is  to  repeat  the mistakes  ofhistory, most recently  in  1986.  That  is,  we  should not  allow anacceleration  of  inflation that  would require  a sharp reversal  inpolicy  later  on.  What we  should be  doing  is  looking  to  move  theinflation  trend  lower.

MR. MCTEER.  Not very much  has  changed  in  the  EleventhDistrict  since  the  last  FOMC meeting.  Employment  growth remainsstrong;  it  is  weaker  than  it  was  in  1994,  but  it  is  stronger  than  thatof  the  nation.  At  the margin, the  expansion of  high-tech  industriesis  accounting  for a  large portion  of  our  employment  growth.  To  giveyou  some  longer-term statistics,  over  the  last  six years  high-techemployment  has  grown  four  times  as  fast  as  total  non-agriculturalemployment  in Texas  and more  than  twice  as  fast  as  high-techemployment  in the  nation.  The  growth of  high-tech  industries  has  beentightening  the market  for  office  space  and other  nonresidential realestate  in  our major  cities.  This  is  primarily  in  the  outer  edges  ofthe  cities,  though,  rather  than  the  inner  cities.  Single-family homeconstruction has picked up.  Single-family permits rose  at  a  10percent  annual  rate  in  the  third  quarter,  and many homebuilders  areraising  their  forecasts  for  1995.  This  strength  has been  driven atleast  as  much by business  relocations  as  it  has  by  lower mortgagerates.  Many Austin  and Dallas  firms  are  recruiting  heavily  from  out-11/15/95-35-of-state  because  of  tight  labor  markets  for  certain skilled workers,engineers  and programmers primarily.  The Mexican border area remainsa weak  spot.  At  our  board of  directors  meeting last  Thursday, all  ofour  directors'  reports  were up  except  for  El  Paso and Brownsville.Earlier  in  the year,  we  kept hearing  reports  that  businesses have beenthrough and have  survived  other peso crises.  But  there  seems  to  be  alot  less bravado  these  days  than  there  was  in  the  early months  of  thatcrisis.  Retail merchants  continue  to  shut  down.  The  limit  on howmuch Mexican citizens  can buy in  the United  States without paying aduty when  they cross  the  bridge back  into  Mexico has  been raised backup  from  $50  to  $400  on November  1st.  But given  the  cut  of  about  50percent  in  the purchasing power of  the peso  on the  other  side  of  theborder,  it  is  probably going to  be  irrelevant  at  this  point.On  the national  economy, I am pleased to  see  the  less  bindingview of  supply-side  constraints  in  the potential  rate  of  growthcontained  in  the  staff  forecast.  This  accords  well  with my own viewsand  recent  economic  results.  The broad outlines  of  the  Greenbookforecast seem  to me  to  be  about right  and reflect  the  fact  that  growthmomentum  has  been  stronger  than we  suspected  and inflationarypressures  a touch weaker  than we had thought  earlier.  I differ  fromthe  Greenbook  in  that  I think the  rates  of  real  growth  forecast  for1996  and 1997  do  not  appear  to  call  for  an upward revision to  theinflation  forecast  in  those years.  Mike  started off  his briefing  bytalking  about  retail  sales.  I might  just  mention that  althoughhad  a terrible  October,  they report  that  nationally  the  firsttwo  weeks of  November have  been very strong.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Theprivate  sector  economy of  the Second  District  grew moderately  inrecent weeks.  In  September, private  payroll  employment  rose  at  anannual  rate  of  1.2  percent  in New York and  0.9  percent  in New Jersey.In  October,  the unemployment  rate  fell  from 6.8  to  6.3  percent  in NewYork State  and was  unchanged at  5.8  percent  in New Jersey.  Loanofficers  are  reporting  that  demand  for most  types  of  consumer  andnonresidential  loans  at  small  and medium-sized banks was  higher  thanit  was  two months  ago.  Consumer confidence  also  improved  in October,rising  12  points  in  the mid-Atlantic  states.  That  still  leaves  theindex at  the  lowest  level  of  the nine  regions  reported by theConference  Board.  Consistent with that  low level  of  confidence,  thelevels  of  retail  sales  and  existing home  sales  have  fallen  sharplyover  the  last  four  to  six weeks.  The  major problem  in  the Districtcontinues  to  be  the  lack of  business  confidence  in the  economicclimate, which  stems  especially  from the  attitude  of  government  in  thecity and state  of  New York.  The problem,  I think,  is  actually gettingmore  severe.  We  had a seminar  last  week co-sponsored with  the Academyof  Sciences  on regional  economic  development  in  the  tri-state area:New York, Connecticut,  and New Jersey.  It  provided an  opportunity  forthe  private  and public  sectors  to  talk  to  each  other, which they  don'tdo  as  often as  one might  like.  Rather  dramatic  were  the  two  seniorbusinessmen who  spoke,  the CEOs  of  American  International  Group andPfizer, both  of  whom are  board members  of  the  Reserve  Bank.  Theytalked  about why  it  would make  sense  to  reduce  substantially  thenumber  of  employees  in New York City.  The  following morning  the Mayorwas  talking  about  how he  was  trying  to  improve  the business  climate  inNew York City, and I suggested  to  him  that  he  better  increase his11/15/95-36-pace.  We  actually put him  together with  the  two  business  executivesat a meeting yesterday.On  the national  level,  we  have been  concerned, as  all  of  youhave,  about  the  explanation  for  the  rather  benign performance  ofinflation in  the  last  couple of  years.  Rick Mishkin and  the  staffhave  been pulling apart  everything  that  they can  think  of  that  wouldbe normal  causes  both  on the  demand-pull  and  cost-push sides  ofinflation.  Essentially, the  only thing we  can  find that  is  notperforming pretty much  as  it  has  over  the  last  10  years  or  so  is  laborcompensation, which is  considerably lower  than  any model  results basedon performance  before  the  last  couple  of years.  I think  the  onlyproblem  is  that  nobody,  including us,  is  very  certain  of  exactly whythat  benign  inflation has been happening.  There are  various  bits  ofpsychology, sociology, and political  science  that  people  areattributing  to  it.  But  I think the  real  fact  is  that  nobody  knows  oris  absolutely sure why  it  is  happening.  Therefore,  it  is  rather  riskyto  predict  that  it  will  continue  to  happen.  On  the other  hand, wedon't  know whether that  is  certain,  either.  It  makes us  ratherconcerned about  our  forecast  in  general.  The reason we have been  soanxious  to  try  to  figure  this  out  is  that  the  Bank has  been very goodin  its  growth  forecast  over  the  last  couple  of  years  and until  veryrecently was  overestimating CPI  growth.  Now we  know why we wereoverestimating  it,  but  that  does  not  give a pure  sign of  where  to  goin  the  future.We  do,  however,  find ourselves unusually  at  variance  with  theGreenbook, not  on the  CPI  forecast where  we were  bickering with them  ayear ago but  rather  on  real  growth.  For example,  in  looking at  realGDP based  on  current  policy, whereas  the  Greenbook has  2-1/2  percentgrowth  in  1996,  we have  2.1  percent.  For  1997  the Greenbook has  2.3percent;  we have  1.9  percent.  There  are  three major sources  of  thisdifference.  We  find the  expansion  rather long-in-the-tooth, andtherefore we  are  less  confident  about  the  growth  of  business  fixedinvestment than  the  Greenbook  is.  We  are somewhat weaker  on netexports,  and we  are a  fair bit  weaker  on housing.  For example,  theGreenbook has  1.45  million  housing starts  for  next year;  we have 1.4million.  Actually,  that makes  both  the  Greenbook and  the New YorkReserve  Bank higher  than  the  consensus.  We  are  about  equal  with  theGreenbook on  the  forecast  of  the  CPI.  Therefore, we  are  looking at  asituation  in which a maintenance  of  current policy may  in  fact  not beappropriate.  So,  we have been doing  some modeling  based on what wouldhappen  if  the  funds  rate were  to  drop  by  1/4  percentage  point  sometimelate  this  quarter  and by another  1/4  percentage point  early next  year.That  gives  us  a somewhat  better mix.  It  does  very  little  to  the  CPIforecast  even  though we  are not  assuming  that  the  current wagerestraint  will  necessarily  continue.  But  it  does  crank up GDP  growthby  .2 percent  from  2.1  to  2.3  percent  in  1996  and from  1.9  to  2.2percent  in  1997,  not highly robust  growth because we  do  continue  tohave  the view that monetary  policy  should be  somewhat restrictive  tocontinue  to  work for  stable prices.  What we  are  concerned about  iswhether it  is  somewhat  too  restrictive  at  the  present  time.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I must  say that  Iwelcome  the more  optimistic  projection  in  the  Greenbook  this  time.For what  it  is  worth, my  judgment would be  right with  the  staff.11/15/95-37-Despite  the  long-in-the-tooth expansion  that  we  have had,  I havebelieved  and continue  to  believe  that  there  is  more  potential  forupside  surprise  than  downside.  I am  sure  it  is  not an  immutable  lawof  economics,  but  it  seems  to  me  that  the U.S.  economy has  a naturaltendency  to  rise unless  something pushes  it  down.  On  balance,  I don'tsee  anything  right now  that  looks  to  be  sufficiently strong  to producethat  result.  If  you  look  down  the  list  of  the  different  elements  ofGDP, and Al  Broaddus  ran  through  that  list  to  some  extent  a while  ago,on balance  it  looks  moderately positive with  some  components beingstronger  than  others,  as  one would expect.  That  is  what  the Greenbooksays;  that  is  where  they are.That  said  on  the  optimistic  side,  I must  say that  I do  wantto  identify with Governor Lindsey  on his remarks  about  consumer debt.He has  done  a lot more  serious  work  on it  than  I.  But  I have  been,and  I think Larry has  been,  crying  "wolf" on  this  subject  for  somemonths  now.  Obviously, we  have  been premature  so  far,  but  I thinksome day we  are  going  to  have  a reckoning  on  this.  I don't  know whenthat  might be  or  how it  might play  out when  it  comes.  Perhaps  becauseI feel  a  little  bit bruised about  having been  Chicken Little  so  far,my best  guess  is  that  it  is  probably going  to  be  out beyond  ourpresent  forecast  period.  If  we  are  going  to  get  a shock,  I think  thatcould be  where  it  will  come  from.  It  does  seem  to  me  that  it  is  goingto  take  a shock  to  push  this  economy  into unacceptable  economicsluggishness.  We  live  in  a dangerous world, of  course,  and  thepotential  shocks  are  out  there.  Consumer debt  is  one  of  them.  We  caneasily  identify  others.  One is  what  is  going  on politically rightnow,  and what  impact  that  might have.  One  can envision  a shock  fromfiscal  drag,  although I certainly  cannot  see  that  happening  in  1996  atthis  point.  Net  exports  could be disappointing;  I hope not.  At  anyrate,  if  we  get  a shock,  it  is  difficult  to  anticipate where  or whenit  might come.  If  we  get  a  shock, we  will  just have  to  deal  withthat.  Other  than  that  I have  to  say I am pretty optimistic.On  the  inflation side, with  the  very high utilization  ratesof  our  human and physical  resources,  I  think we have been  gettingremarkably good results.  It  is  a  little difficult  for me  to  see  howthe  inflation picture  is  going  to  improve, although  I guess  in  recentmonths  it  has  had  a slight  tendency  to  improve.  Maybe  today's  newswill  be  a straw in  the  wind in  the  other direction.  But  so  far,  it  isvery difficult  to  see  much by way of upside push  there.  I do  thinkthat  given our  high utilization level,  an upside  risk potential  couldbecome  apparent  as  time  goes  on,  and we will  have  to  be very carefulabout  that  going  forward.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor  Phillips.

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  At  our  last meetingwe said  that  we would know more at  this  meeting,  and now we  are allscratching our heads.  We  do know more,  but  now we are  trying tofigure out  what  it  means.  We may well  be  in  another  fourth-downsituation.  I agree with Mike Prell  that  forecasting  is  a trulyhumbling profession.  We  have all  had  the  opportunity  to  reevaluatesome  things  since  the  last  meeting.  As  Mike  chronicled for us,  anumber  of  the  statistics  have come  in  stronger  than were anticipatedat  that  meeting:  GDP,  industrial production,  and  consumer spending.The  export situation  seems  to  be  improving as  the  economies  of  ourtrading partners  appear  to  be  on  the mend or  strengthening.  At 5.511/15/95-38-percent  unemployment,  the  labor market  appears  to  be  a bit better  thanexpected.  Except  for  today's  CPI  news,  the  recent  inflation news  hasbeen better than  expected.  Evidence appears  to  be  gathering  that  theNAIRU may be  lower  than  6 percent.  Business  fixed  investmentprojections  look  a bit  better  than  we had earlier  thought.  The recentproductivity numbers  are  above  trend, unless  one  has  made  the mentalconversion already  to  chain weights.What  are  the  implications  of  this  reevaluation?  Takentogether,  all  this  information may indicate  that  labor  and productwould suggest.  Monetary  policy may not  be  as  restrictive  as  we hadearlier  thought.  I think that  the  financial markets  are  consistentwith that  observation.  Stock prices  are up;  bond prices  are up;  theyield  curve  has  flattened during  the  intermeeting period;  the  dollarhas been  steadier.  The  cost  of  capital  still  favors business  spendingon  investment.  Credit market  demands  have  flattened  a bit  in  the  mostrecent  data, but  they are  still  indicative  of a propensity to  spend.Perhaps  the  folks who  have  suggested  that  the  risks  are  on the  up  sideare right;  maybe  we  have missed  the  soft  landing and are  ready  foranother  takeoff.  Alternatively, it  may be  time  to  adjust  our  thinkingto  chain-weighted statistics.  The  data  seem  a bit  more consistent,  orat  least more  explainable, using  these  statistics.In  spite  of  the  "conflictive" evidence,  I continue  tobelieve,  similar  to  Mike  Prell,  that  the  best outlook  is  for moderategrowth.  In  coming to  this  somewhat unexciting  conclusion,  I continueto  look at  the  labor  markets  as  a key.  People,  except  for  Federalgovernment people,  are  working.  Employment  growth has  slowed,  though,to  the point where  we  are  just  dealing with demographic  increases.People are  still mobile.  I think  the reengineering  that  we have  gonethrough continues  to  create  some  uncertainty.  All  of  this  is,  Ithink,  showing  up  in  the wage situation.  We  are  not  seeing  increasedwage pressures,  though perhaps we  will.  Perhaps  at  some point  workerswill  be  able  to  exert  enough  influence  to  move wages  and  real  incometo  higher levels,  but we  don't  appear  to  be  at  that  point  yet.  Thatindicates  to  me  that  spending  is  going to  be  cautious.  We also  haveto  consider the  fiscal  budget  situation.  The  longer  this  debate  dragson,  I think the  more uncertain  the  effects  are going  to  be.Otherwise,  and aside  from the  budget  situation,  there do  not appear  tobe  major  imbalances  in  the real  economy  or  the  financial  markets.In  sum,  I am  sticking  to  the  story of  moderate  growth,  and Iwill  go  even  a bit  further  in  view of  the  strong  third-quarter dataand  the  financial  market  signals.  It  is  possible  that  the probabilitydistribution around  a mean  of potential  growth has narrowed  a bit.

MR.  BLINDER.  I am not  going to  say anything  about myDistrict  economy because  you  do not  want  to  hear  about  it!  My  oneanecdote would be  that  the  traffic  was unusually light  driving  in  thismorning.  I will  leave  it  at  that.I was very  comfortable with  the  September  Greenbook forecast.Like  Al  Broaddus,  I was  struck by the  large  size  of  the  revision  inthe  latest  Greenbook.  It  was  a considerably larger  revision  than  Imade  mentally based on  the  third-quarter  GDP report.  Specifically,11/15/95-39-the  shock to  the  staff,  and  I guess  to  me, of  about  1/2  percentagepoint  on  the  level  of GDP--that  is  2 percentage points  on  the  growthrate  for  a single  quarter--led the  staff  as  Al  noted to  raise  thelevel  of  GDP  in  the middle  of  1997  by about  2-1/2  times  that  much, byabout  1-1/4  percentage point.  We discussed  this  yesterday at  theBoard meeting.  I personally would have been  inclined, and  still  am,to  be  suspicious  about  the  third-quarter  GDP report--in  twodimensions.  One  is  that  there  were  certain flukish  aspects, which  isnot  atypical.  The  other  involves  the deflator.  I keep  staring at  thetranslation of  the  nominal GDP  into  real  GDP by using a  0.6  percentdeflator.  Fortunately, we  are  behind  closed doors  here.  I neverpredict  data  revisions  in public  because  it  is  a  stupid  thing to  do.But  in  the quiet  of  my own  study,  I expect  that  to  be  revised.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  Yes.  [Laughter]  I know  it  is  on  thetranscript, but  fortunately no  one will  know I said  that  for  fiveyears.  I don't have  to  say  it  publicly.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  In  fact,  we may not publish  another number  in1987  dollars!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MS.  PHILLIPS.  You  are  saved!

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That  is  a very good point.  I would have  beeninclined  to  boost the  forecast between  September and now by  less.Now,  I don't  want  to  overstate  that point.  Adding  .7 percentage  pointto  GDP  in a two-year period is  well below  the ability of anybody  toforecast, but  one does  have  to make  a point  estimate  somewhere.  So,I'm not  saying  that  the  staff's  judgment  is  wild.  It  just  seemed  abit  sporty  to me.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I'm a  sporty kind of  guy!

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Yes,  that's  right.  They are prone  to  thingslike  that.  That  is  what happens  if  you work  at  the  Federal  Reserve  along time!  [Laughter]  I had  two  things  on my desk  that  I couldeasily pick up  to  compare.  The Blue  Chip  forecasters--now, that  is  aconsensus,  of  course,  so  their  forecast  is  going  to  move  less--changed  their  1996  and  1997  cumulated  growth  rate by  zero  between amonth ago  and now.  Larry Meyer  changed his  forecast by  .1 percentagepoint  in each year;  so  he moved up  1997  by  .2 point.  Those aresamples  that  happened to  be  on my  desk and  that  I looked at  thismorning before  I walked in.  A  notable  feature  of  the  new  forecast,  towhich Al  Broaddus  and Jerry Jordan made reference,  is  that  theimplicit equilibrium real  funds  rate  in  the  forecast now  is  2.75percent,  which  it  was  not  the  last  time.  You  can just  see  that  by thebehavior of  the  economy with a constant  unemployment rate  and aconstant  inflation rate.  That  happens despite  a budget  deficit, whichis  now  down to  about  2 percent  of  GDP and  falling  and, moreimportantly I believe,  is  projected to  fall.  It  ought  to  be  expectedthat  government budget  deficits  move  ex ante  real  interest  rates.11/15/95-40-That  seems  rather  high to  me  based on past experience when we  have  haddeficits  of  that  size  in  this  economy.  Again,  it's not wildly high,just  a bit on  the  high side.  One reason,  though  not  the  only  reason,for  the  staff's  upgrading  of  the  GDP  forecast  is  that  long  rates  are30  basis points  lower now,  give  or  take  a little,  than  they were  atthe  time  of  the  September FOMC meeting.  I pointed  out  the  followingto  Mike Prell  yesterday, and  I will  just  point it  out  to  everybodyhere  today.  The  reasons  given  in  the market  for  the  further  notchdown of  long  rates  are  the  following  four--I  think  this  is  the  wholelist:  increased expectations  of  Fed  easing, lower  reported actualinflation and  implicitly expected  inflation, more  optimism  aboutdeficit  reduction, and perceptions  of  a weakening expansion  ofeconomic  activity.  The changes  in  the  staff  forecast  between  the  lastGreenbook  and the  current  Greenbook, which no  longer  assumes  any Fedeasing,  include  a  little more  pessimism about  inflation,  less  deficitreduction, and  stronger GDP growth.  Now, I don't mean to  imply  that  Ithink  the  staff  is  wrong.  The bond market  is  a lousy  forecaster.  Ibelieve  our  staff  can probably educe  evidence  that  they  forecast  GDPbetter  than does  the bond market;  I am sure  they can.  But  I bringthat  up because  I do  worry about  the  internal  consistency  of  theforecast.  If  the  strength  in  the  forecast  is  largely predicated onlower  real  interest  rates, but  the  reasons  in  the  market  for  the  lowerreal  interest  rates  contradict  those  in  the  staff  forecast,  it willnot  come  true.  More  specifically,  it  suggests  to me  that  if  the  staffforecast  starts  coming  true, bond  rates will  rise  substantially and  Iwould suppose  more  than  is  built  into  the  forecast.One  final  point:  At  the  last  meeting many of  uscharacterized the Greenbook as  too  good to  be true.  I believe  I wasone,  but  I didn't go  back and  check  the  transcript.  That was  the  lastGreenbook.  This  one  is  better.  The  risk to  me  in  this  Greenbookforecast  looks  disproportionately on  the  down  side.  Some  of  you mayremember  that  for a  long  time  the biggest  risk  to me  in  the  staffforecast  has  been  the  so-called  train wreck.  Nine  months  ago  it  waswell  into  the  future;  two months  ago  it  was  getting close;  and now weare  in  it.  The  government  lockout  is  a vastly greater  event  than  theBoeing  strike by a  factor of  40  or  something  like  that.  In  the  firstplace,  this  is  going  to  have,  as  Governor  Lindsey and  someone  elsesaid, a  sort  of  standard Keynesian  effect  on  aggregate demand.  Thereare  fewer people working;  they don't  have as  much money to  spend.  Italso has  the potential  to  scare people  and shatter  confidence  just  ata time  when  the  economy  is  teetering  as  to  where  it  should be.Further,  it  has  the  potential--knock on wood that  it  won't  happen--torattle  financial  markets,  as  we  are  all  well  aware.  I think  that  is  adanger.The second  downside risk  to  me  is  the  weakening economicoutlook  in  all  the G-7  countries.  I don't want  to  exaggerate  thatrisk.  I don't  think this  is  a huge difference,  and developments  inMexico may be  a bigger deal  for us  potentially than  the G-7.  Finally,with  about  1/8  the weight  that  Governor  Lindsey put on  it  and  1/4  theweight  that  Governor Kelley put  on  it,  I would  list  consumer debtproblems  as  the  third  set  of  downside  risks.  I have  a hard timethinking  of  upside  risks  that  are  of  comparable  likelihood.  Thankyou.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Yellen.11/15/95-41-

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  I will  just  conclude  the  roundtable by  echoingmy agreement with  a number  of  the points  that  already have  surfaced inthis  discussion.  Certainly,  from my perspective  the  incoming dataflow  since  our  last meeting  has  contained  surprises  and the  surprisesdo  necessitate  some  rethinking of  the  underlying momentum  in  aggregatedemand and also  the  inflation  risk.  The  staff's view  is  that  the newspoints  to  significantly greater  underlying strength  in  aggregatedemand  and a modest  reduction in  inflation risk.  I certainly agreewith both of  those  assessments  in  a qualitative  sense, but  likeGovernor Blinder  and a number  of other members  I guess  I questionwhether or not  the  new forecast  does  represent  something of  anoverreaction  to  one  month of  really rather  perplexing economic  news.In  the  September Greenbook,  the  staff  forecast an  unemployment rate  of6.2  percent  in  the  fourth quarter  of  1997  accompanied by a realfederal  funds  rate  of  2.8  percent.  The  current  forecast  envisions  anunemployment rate  of  5.7  percent  in  the  fourth quarter  of  1997,  namely1/2  point  lower  or as  Governor  Blinder put  it  1-1/4  points  higher  onreal  GDP,  along with an unchanged  federal  funds  rate  of  about  2.8percent  in  real  terms.  The  staff,  I would  guess,  has  concluded  thatthe  recent news  has  not  just  a  transitory effect--it's not  just  astatistical  aberration  as  Ed Boehne put  it--but has  permanentsignificance.A  look at  a method  that  I thought  was useful  for  summarizinghow much  the  staff's  forecast  has  changed would be  to  measure  this  interms  of  the  equilibrium  real  federal  funds  rate.  One  can infer  fromthe alternative  simulations  presented in  the Greenbook  that  theequilibrium  real  federal  funds  rate,  which  I am now defining as  thereal  federal  funds  rate  in  1997  that would be  consistent with  a givenfixed unemployment  rate, has  been  revised upward by about  130  basispoints  since  our  last meeting.  In  other words,  the  IS  curve  hasshifted up by  about  130  basis points  over  the  last  month  according  tothe  staff.  I think the  staff procedure  for  generating the  currentforecast  is  easily defended on  statistical  grounds  because  surprisesin demand  do  appear  to  have persistence.  Nevertheless,  I hesitate  toaccept  the  conclusion  at  this  point  that  one  month's  confusing datashould  occasion such a  large revision  in  our assessment  of  theeconomic outlook,  especially when there  is  a variety of  indicatorspointing  to  greater  softness  in  the  economy.  These would  include--andall  of  these  have been mentioned--anecdotal  reports  from industrycontacts, yesterday's  weak retail  sales  reading,  sluggish auto  demand,evidence  of  rising  consumer  debt  problems  that  Governors  Lindsey andKelley have  emphasized,  today's  IP  number,  softness  in  the purchasingmanagers'  survey, a rising moving average  of  initial  claims  forunemployment  insurance,  and signs  of  softer  growth  in  Europeaneconomies.  All  this  is  coupled with  impressive  commitments  to  fiscalconsolidation.  And finally, of  course,  we  have  the  current  trainwreck, which could  impair household  finances  and  spirits  going  intothe  Christmas  season.  Rather  than  quibble  with the  details  of  thestaff's point  forecast,  I would prefer  to  reserve  judgment  for  a whileand await  further  clarification  from incoming  data,  assuming  that  thegovernment  shutdown doesn't  actually end up  eliminating  the  continuingdata  flow.On  the  inflation  front  the  news  since  our  last  meeting,  itseems  to  me,  has been  on balance  favorable.  I was particularlyimpressed by the  reading  on  the  core  PPI  which has  remained unchangedand the  fact  that  intermediate  goods  inflation has  registered its11/15/95-42-second monthly negative.  But  most  important,  as  a number  of  you haveemphasized,  is  that  total  hourly compensation grew at  a mere  2.3percent  in  the  third quarter,  and  I guess  it  is  that  continuingrestraint  in  the employment  cost  index  that  justifies  the  downwardrevision of  the NAIRU and  the  improvement  in the  inflation  forecast.I think the  revisions  in  the  staff's  natural  rate  assumption and  inaggregate demand reflect  a response  to  data  surprises  that  we  don'tfully  understand.  But  in  this  instance  I would emphasize  that  thereaction  is  based on  a lot  more  than  a  single month's  data.  Icertainly would agree with Bill  McDonough's  assessment  of  the  evidencehere.  We now  have  had about  six quarters  in  which the  rate  of  growthin nonfarm compensation,  as  measured by  the  ECI,  has  been  falling  inspite  of  continued  low measured  levels  of  labor market  slack.  It  doesseem  from my standpoint,  and I assume  from the  staff's  and Bill's  aswell,  that most  of  the models  we monitor  have been  consistentlysurprised.  The  surprise has  persisted;  it  is  substantial.  Our modelsare  overforecasting,  if  I understand  the  evidence properly,  on  theorder of  .7 percent  in  the annual  growth  rate per  quarter,  andcumulatively this  certainly  is  a statistically significant  surprise.Of  course,  I also agree  that  we  need to  be  careful  here  and notoverreact  to  the  information.  I think  the  staff  has  been cautious.They  have not yet  concluded  that  we are  witnessing  a permanentstructural  shift.  I agree  this may  end up being  a  transitory supplyshock.  I do remain  perplexed that  the  moderation in compensation andunit  labor  costs  has  not yet  translated  into  a reduction  in  coreinflation.  I would also  agree  that  price-price  Phillips  curvepredictions, while  slightly  off  the  mark, remain  essentially  on  track.At  our last  meeting  I argued  that  the  economy  suffers  fromwhat  I called  a  "termites in  the basement" problem.  It  is  a biastoward below  trend growth  the  further  out one  goes  in  the  forecast.It  stems  from insufficient momentum  in private spending  to  compensatefor growing  fiscal  drag and  the  real  federal  funds  rate  remaining  atits  current  level.  As  I try to  move  away  from the  data  and  simplyfocus  on economic  fundamentals,  I find  it  difficult  to  understand whatcomponents  of  demand can  be  expected to  replace  lost  governmentspending on  a persisting basis  over  the  longer  term unless  there  iscontinuing  impetus  from  interest and  exchange  rates.  I think thatfinancial  markets  share  this  view.  Indeed,  the  Greenbook acknowledgesthat  the present  level  of  real  long-term  interest  rates  is  conditionedon both  the  expectation  that  there will  be deficit  reduction  and  theexpectation  that  short-term rates  eventually  will  fall  gradually.  Ithink  the  expectation  of  a cut  in  the  funds  rate  in  the not  toodistant  future,  as  Peter  Fisher  emphasized, is  built  into  the  currentstructure  of  fed  funds  futures  so  that  a failure  to  validate  thatexpectation  is  most  likely  to  lead to  a backup  in  long rates.  Whilethe  current  Greenbook  forecast  calls  the markets'  views  as  well  as  myown  into  question and  indeed  the Greenbook may  turn out  to  be  right--Ihave  an  open mind on  this--from my perspective  the  level  ofuncertainty has  increased.  I would like  to  wait  and  see what  theChristmas  season  and the  budget  negotiations hold  in  store,  but  Iconsider  the  preponderance  of  risks  at  this  point  to  be  on  the  downside  of  the Greenbook  scenario.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will  be referencing,by the way, the  last  chart  in  the  Financial  Indicators package.  Ifyou don't  have  that  with you,  I think Carol  Low has  some  extras.  Iwould  like  to  begin by discussing  a new chart  that  appears  at  the  endof  that  package and  use  that  as  a transition  into  a discussion  of  thecurrent  stance  of  policy.  [Statement--see  Appendix.]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What happens  to your  Taylor  chart  if  youextend  it  back before  1987?

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It  doesn't  look very  good, but  I don't know what"very good" means.  That  is,  the Taylor  rule  does  not  track whatactually happened, particularly over the  previous  seven or eight  yearsin  the Volcker era.  Real  funds  rates were  considerably higher  thanthe Taylor  chart would have  suggested.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  How does  it  look before  the  1980s?

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Perhaps  Governor  Yellen or  Governor  Blinder willremember better  than  I, but  it  seems  to  me  that  the  federal  fundsrates were  too  low.  That would  confirm  the  notion that  policy waseasier  than  it  should  have been  to  achieve price  stability.  Do youremember?

[SECTION]

MS.  YELLEN.  For  the  late  1960s  and early  1970s  I thinkthat's  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  It  clearly doesn't  fit  the ups  and downs  inthat period.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  No,  it  doesn't  do  a very  good job.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  It  was developed  for you, Mr.  Chairman, not  forPaul  Volcker!  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR.  KELLEY.  It  looks  the  way it  should!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  John used  to  work for me  in  the privatesector and maybe  he  read my mind better  than  I do.  Questions  for  Don?

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  John's  choice  of  .5 for  each coefficient  isconvenient pedagogically.  Have  you ever  looked  at  estimating  it?  Thetwo  coefficients  are  quite  different  if  you  use estimates.  As you  cansee,  they produce much higher  federal  funds  rates.  I think  in  themost  recent period the  coefficient on  the  income  variable  is  closer  to.8 and the  coefficient on  the  price variable  is  about  .3.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Yes.  I  think  it  matters  a lot  over what periodone  is  estimating  it.  Of  course,  I think John picked  those  in partout  of  some  experience  with  large-scale modeling  exercises,  such aswere  carried  out  under  the  aegis  of  the Brookings  Conference  a coupleof years ago.  I think  they also were  picked because  they  lookedreasonable.  The bottom panel  is  a statistical  exercise  and that  doesshow pretty high weights  on  the unemployment  gap,  the  resource gap--

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes.11/15/95-44-

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Some  of  these  estimates  don't  show  the  FOMC payingmuch  attention  to  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  It's  a closer  representation of  what  the Fedactually did  than  just  the  selection of  the  .5 and  .5.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  It's  fitted to  be  a close  representation of  whatwe  did.

[SECTION]

MR.  PARRY.  Okay.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I just  want  to  make the  point with  regard  tothe  last  argument  that  you mentioned,  Don,  in your prepared remarks.Since  the gap  is  a  forecast of  inflation, you  could read  that  as  theexpected change  in  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Sure.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  I would not quite  translate getting  a zero  onthe  second coefficient  as  an  indication  that  the  Committee  did notcare  about  inflation.  One  can reinterpret  this  as  indicating that  theonly  thing  the Committee  cares  about  is  the  level  and rate of  changeof  inflation.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Right.

[SECTION]

MR.  BLINDER.  It  admits  of  that  interpretation.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Yes,  although  I would have  to  think  about that  alittle.  The  fact  that  everything goes  to  the  output  gap  suggests  thatyou  are  not particularly sensitive  to what  the  inflation  rate  is  whenyou  close  the gap.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That's  right.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  You need something  on  that  inflation  target  toprovide  you with a nominal  anchor  it  seems  to  me.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  That's  correct.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  The  other  thing  that's  interesting  is  that  theconstant  is  about  2.7  as  opposed  to  2.0  and,  of  course,  that's  thereal  rate.

[SECTION]

MR.  KOHN.  Yes.  I am not  sure  what John Judd did at  the  SanFrancisco Bank, but  when we  fit  this  the  constant  actually  embodiesboth  the  equilibrium real  rate and  the  Committee's  inflation  target.So,  you have  to  make  an  assumption about  one  to  separate  out  theother.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions  for  Don?  If  not,  letme  start  off.  Frankly,  I didn't  find  the  roundtable particularlysurprising.  It  had pretty much the  mixed flavor  of  what  is  going  onin  the  country District by District.  In retrospect,  the  strength  inthe  third quarter  was not  all  that  surprising considering  that  theeconomy was  coming  off  a very weak  set  of  developments  after  the  earlyweeks  of  this  year.  As you  will  recall,  we  had particularly seriousconcerns  about  the  adjustments  that  were going  on  in  inventories  that11/15/95-45-we  felt  could-conceivably  tilt  the  economy into  a decline.  Indeed,there  was one meeting which  I found  somewhat distressing back  in  Julywhere  the  general  tone  of  our  discussion was  that  all  the  risks  wereon  the down side  even  though virtually everyone was projectingmoderate growth.  One got  the  impression that  if  we  had a choice  of  asecond  opinion  on  the economy,  it  clearly would have  been down.  Thatwas  a time  when,  as  I recall,  we were  getting very  severe contractionsin  steel  markets,  industrial prices  were weakening,  inventories  werebacking up  in  a number  of  areas  of  the  economy, and  it  was  only as  weworked our  way through  the probabilities  that  we  concluded  that  wewere moving beyond  the point  of  the maximum risk  of  a recession.Under  those  conditions,  I think we would expect  to  get  a  "pop" in  theeconomy when  the downside pressures begin  to  ease.  This  occurs  in  thethink  that  surge  should be  viewed  as  a  change  in  trend, and  indeed  themore recent  indications,  as  a number of  members  have noted,  are  thatthe  economy at  this  stage  can best  be described,  at  least  temporarily,in  terms  of  its  sogginess.  The economy  is  not  deteriorating, but  itclearly has  lost  a good deal  of  the  momentum that  it  had  during  thesummer.  It  is,  however,  difficult  to  make very much  of  that becauseas best  I can see  the  evidence  does  suggest  that  the  economy is  stillundergoing  some  inventory correction.  It  is  still  coming off  a fairlyweak motor vehicles  sales pattern.  A crucial  issue  at  this  stagerelates  to  what  is  going to  be  happening  to  Christmas  sales  in termsof  setting  the  tone,  if  I may put  it  that  way, for  the  trend in  retailexpenditures.  Such expenditures  in  the  fourth quarter are not  asimple average  of  seasonally adjusted October, November, and  Decemberbecause  the monthly seasonals  for  those  months  differ  so  dramatically.Certain  items  obviously will  account  for  a very  substantial part  ofthe quarterly  total  in  a  several-week period  just  before  Christmas.  Idon't  want  to  overemphasize  that, but  I think the point  that  isimplicit  in  the Greenbook--that  there  is  a likelihood of  a  significantrecovery  in November and December--is  still  on  the  table.  Indeed, theearly data  are  at  least  suggesting that  Christmas  sales  are  doing alittle better.The major problem that  we  have  so  far  as  policy  is  concernedis  that  while  the  economy  seems  to  be  as  close  to  middle  ground  as  oneever  sees  it,  it's  not  clear which way it  is  going.  In  that  regard,no  change  today strikes me  as  the most  appropriate response,  and Iwill  get  to  the  "train wreck" issue  in  a minute.  What  I think isunclear  at  this  stage  is  what we will be  wishing  to  do at  the Decembermeeting if  this  economy continues  to  be  as  soft  as  it  is.  As  Iindicated previously, I  think  that  at  some  point  we  should be  lookingtoward a  somewhat  lower  real  funds  rate  in  1996.  Whether  we will  getthere  in  part  in  December  or  wait  until  later,  I don't  have  anyparticular notion.  But  I do  agree with  the Greenbook  that,  if  theeconomy  is  coming back and we  are  getting  anywhere near  the  numbers  inthe Greenbook  forecast,  at  that  level  of  activity we  probably ought  tobe quite cautious  in  how we move.There  is  one  important  issue  with respect  to  the  budgetnegotiations  that  I think we  have  to  keep  in mind.  If  we  lockourselves  into  a  "no change" position pending what  happens  in  thosenegotiations, we  could find  ourselves  sitting  and doing nothing as  theeconomy  is  changing  and  the markets  are  changing while  the  Congress11/15/95-46-and  the  President  continue  to  diddle  on  this  issue.  We have  argued inthe past,  and I think  quite correctly,  that  it  has  never beenappropriate  for  the  Federal  Reserve  to  "make a deal"  with the  Congressor  the Administration  to  take  some  action  if  a budget  is  produced andirrespective  of  whether  it  is  credible  or  not  credible.  I think weall  have  agreed, as  best  I can  judge,  that  the  response  that  we makeis  to  the  markets.  If  the markets  believe  that  the  budget  deal  iscredible,  long-term rates  will  come  down and we  will  get  anabnormality in  the  term structure  of rates  if  short-term rates  remainunchanged.  So  the  pressures  on us  to  ease policy would come  from theis  what would induce  us  to  move.  Conversely, if  the  economy issoftening, or  indeed  strengthening, the  mere fact  that  thenegotiations are  under way  should not be  all  that  relevant  other thanwhat  conceivably could happen  should be  part  of  our  outlook.  The merefact  of negotiations  should not  induce us  to  take  action because  Ithink  that  could  turn  out  to  be very unfortunate monetary  policy.I would therefore  suggest  that  while  it  is  terribly importantto  have  the members'  judgments  about what  the negotiations  are  goingto  produce,  I don't  think that  should be  an overriding  issue withrespect  to what  we  do  or what  we do not  do.  Incidently, with  theoutlook as  mixed as  it  is,  I would not  rule out  a  surprisingacceleration in  this  expansion.  There  is  nothing  in  this  outlook  thatis  undermining the  structure  of  the  economy.  So  it  would not besurprising, as  Governor Kelley  indicated,  that  if  no  adverse  eventsoccur this  expansion could  suddenly take  off.  Profit margins  stillseem  to  be  reasonably stable.  The order pattern and  some of  the  high-tech  industries are  really quite  impressive.  We  do  not  yet know howlong  this  malaise,  if  you will  excuse  the  expression, in  theindustrial  area  is  going  to  continue.  In  the  steel  industry,  despitethe  significant declines  in  steel  sheet  prices,  the  order patterns  arelooking  better.  Fairly  recently, U.S.  Steel has  been reporting  a muchbetter  outlook.  So,  I think this  is  a two-sided  issue.  We  really  arenot  going  to  get  a good fix  on  the  industrial  sector  for  a while.  AndI am not  certain  that  it  matters  all  that  much because  the  economydoes not  appear  to  be  threatened at  this  stage,  and  the urgency  ofmoving  quickly one  way or  the  other  is  not  there.  I suspect  that  thelatest  CPI  is  probably an  aberration.  We  don't know that  for  sure,but  the  evidence  of  restrained unit  costs  and the  existing high profitVice  Chairman  says,  the  fact  that  the  expansion  is  "long  in  the  tooth"and what we  ordinarily would expect  of  an  aging expansion.  Thiseconomy does  not have  the geriatric  characteristics  that  one  wouldexpect  of  an  economy that  is  six or  seven months  beyond  the  averagelength  of  the post-World War  II  expansions.  It  doesn't  look  that wayand  it  doesn't  feel  that  way.  Nonetheless,  I think  what we have  to  beaware  of  is  that  if  this  economy  fails  to  pick up  and continues  to  besoggy  into  the next  meeting,  the  evidence  in  favor  of  a move  at  thattime  would probably become  more compelling  than  it  is  today.At  this  point,  I would recommend  that  we  do nothing  and hopethat  an unchanged policy turns  out  to  be  where we  can be  for  quite  awhile,  as  the  Greenbook  assumes.  I am agnostic,  frankly,  on  whetherwe  should  have a  symmetric  or  an  asymmetric directive,  and  I wouldvery much appreciate  that  those  of  you  who  agree  with  "B"  alsostipulate where you  think  the  intermeeting  symmetry  ought  to  be.Those who  lean  toward  a change  at  some  point would,  of  course,  favor11/15/95-47-asymmetry in  one direction  or  the  other.  So,  that  is  myrecommendation  for  this meeting.  Who would like  to  comment?President  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

MR. FORRESTAL.  Mr. Chairman,  first  of  all  I would like  toassociate myself with  the  remarks  that  Governors Yellen  and Blindermade  with respect  to  the  risks  to  the  economy.  Secondly, as  I arguedlast  time,  it  seems  to  me  that  interest  rates  are  on  the high  siderelative to  inflation and  to  history.  No matter  how we  think  aboutthe Greenbook  or  the  revisions  there,  I think that  we  are  in  a periodwhere economic  activity  is  best  characterized as  moderate,  and  in boththe Greenbook  forecast  and our own  forecast, moderation  is  the  keyword throughout  the  forecast  horizon.  At  the same  time, we  haverelatively low  inflation and, given  the  federal  funds  rate  of  5-3/4percent, we have a real  interest rate  of  around 3 percent.  Over timein my view  such a  rate  is  going  to  inhibit  investment,  job  creation,and economic  growth.  That  is  not going  to  happen now, to  be  sure,  andI don't  think  it's  critical  that we  move  today, but  there are  a  lot  oflong-term  and short-term arguments  that,  on  balance,  lead me  to  theconclusion  that  the  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  too  high, thatit  will  have  to  be  reduced eventually,  and that  any reduction will  nothave much  of  an  impact  on  inflation.  I would therefore  be  inclined  tomove right  now.  So,  if  you were  to  give me  those  three  or  four  votes,Mr. Chairman,  I would  cast  all  of  them  in  that  direction.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr.  Chairman,  for  the  reasons  that  you outlinedI agree  with your  analysis  and I support  your recommendation of  "nochange."  Because  I don't  think we  should  be  trying  to  guess  which waythe economy  is  going at  this  stage,  I feel  that  a  symmetric  directiveis  quite  appropriate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman,  I certainly  agree with yourrecommendation for  "no change."  I am not  agnostic  on  the  symmetry;  Ithink we  should have  a  symmetric  directive.  The  staff  forecast  andthe  revision  in  that  forecast  have made me more aware  of  and moresensitive  to  the  upside  risks  in  the  outlook  than perhaps  I wasbefore.  I think  it's premature  to  take  a position even  through  thesymmetry of  the directive  as  to  what  our  next  move  might be.  I  thinkwe gained  a huge amount  of  credibility  in  1994  by preventing  thestrength  in  the economy  that  emerged really  quite quickly  in  late  1993and early  1994  from becoming  a boom, and  I would hate  to  do  somethingnow that  might  diminish  that  credibility  or put  it  at  risk.11/15/95-48-

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I,  too,  agree  with your overall  policyposition, Mr. Chairman.  I also  agree with  the  concept  of  keeping  thedirective  symmetric.  I do  see  the  risks  as  being  reasonably balanced,not  so  tilted to the  down  side  as  some  believe.  I agree  that  weshould  not have  our hands  tied by  the  current  and prospective  debtimpasse  on  the part  of  the  federal  government,  although  I wonder howthis  will play  out  going  into  the  future.  If  even by  the  next  meetingwe  were  to  see--and  that may be  unlikely--an unexpected accelerationof growth,  something  that  might make us  want  to  change  interest  ratesby raising  them  rather  than  lowering  them, I wonder  how an  asymmetricdirective  toward ease  would play out  in  that  environment.  Whether  ornot  that  scenario  turns  out  to  be  the  case,  I wonder  if we  will  findthat monetary policy will  be  somewhat hampered  if  the budgetnegotiations  drag  on  for  a period of  time.  I hope  they won't.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Blinder.

[SECTION]

MR. BLINDER.  Mr. Chairman,  I find myself  very much  of  a mindwith Bob Forrestal.  If  the  third quarter  had come  in weak,  say under2 percent,  I am sure  I would be  arguing  strongly for  a cut  today basedon  four  arguments:  (1) the weakness  in  the  economy;  (2) the  very goodinflation performance;  (3) the high,  by almost  any  standard, realfederal  funds  rate--all  of  those  are  familiar reasons;  and,  (4) issomething  that  you  alluded  to  and Cathy Minehan  just  alluded  to  in  adifferent way.  I am  becoming  increasingly uneasy about  the  FederalReserve being  cast  in a role  that  we  don't want  as  the rewarding  orpunishing  father who  looks  at  the  President  and Congress  and  says  "Youdid well  so  I am cutting  interest  rates,"  or  "You did poorly so  I amraising  interest  rates."  We  really  do not want  to  be  in  thatposition, which  is  another virtue  of  making  a small  rate  cutdisassociated  from a budget  agreement.  I think this  is  a  factor  thatwe  should think about  because we  are  very much  in  danger  of  beingpigeonholed  into  that  posture.  But,  of  course,  the  third quarter of1995  did not  come  in weak;  it  came  in  quite  strong.  I already saidthat  I don't buy the  staff's  extrapolation of  that  upward revisioninto  1996  and  1997.  Nonetheless,  the  third quarter  is  what  it  was  andit  brings  us  into  1996  at  a higher  base  level  of  resource  utilization,and that  certainly  seems  to  be  reality or  a reasonable  guess  aboutreality.  And as  noted, the  staff  also  claims  that  the  equilibriumreal  funds  rate  is  about  2-3/4  percent despite  the  heavy deficitreduction.  Again,  I was  skeptical  about  that.  I want  to  point out,though,  that  if  the  staff's  forecast and  estimate  of  the  equilibriumreal  funds  rate  are  correct,  I definitely agree,  as  Don said,  that  weshould not be  cutting  interest  rates.  If  I bought  into  that  entirely,these  arguments  would  evaporate.  It's  possible  that  the  staff  is11/15/95-49-right,  but I don't  think so.  And  it  still  leaves  intact  two  of  thefour  reasons.  The  reason  I said  I was  very much  of  a mind with Bob  isthat  the  strength  of  the economy  in  the  third quarter really destroysany argument  that  there  is  an urgency to  this,  that  we  can't  wait  fiveweeks.  I couldn't possibly  argue  for  that  proposition.  Thus,  while  Icould  support  a  small  cut  now if  the  Committee were going  in  thatdirection,  I could also  support  waiting until  the  19th  of  December,but  I would very much  favor  an asymmetric  directive  toward ease.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Boehne.

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE.  I support  the  "no change"  in  "B." I think thereis  enough uncertainty  in  the  economy,  and  it  is  on a moderate  growth,low  inflation kind of  track.  My sense,  and it's  entirely judgmental,is  that  the  federal  funds  rate  is  on  the  high  side  of  where  we willwant  it  going  forward  and  that we  will  need to  adjust  it  downwardwithin  the  next  several months.  However,  at  this  point,  given  theuncertainties  about  the  outlook,  I would be  inclined not  to prejudgepolicy in any way and,  therefore,  I would  go  for  a symmetricaldirective.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Parry.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I agree  with your  recommendationand  I also would prefer  symmetry.  It  seems  to me  that  we have  had amodest  temporary increase  in  the real  funds  rate, but  I think we  oughtto be  willing to  accept  that.  Our  forecast  and  that  in  the  Greenbookexpect  some pickup  in  inflation.  That  suggests  that  the  increase  inreal  rates  is  temporary,  and until  we  see  that  that  is  an  incorrectforecast,  I can't  see  a good reason  to  move  today.  So, my preferenceclearly would be  to  leave  the  nominal  federal  funds  rate  constant  atthis  point.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President  Stern.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I favor  "B" symmetric  at  this  meeting.  I mightsay a word or  two about what  we might consider going  forward fromhere.  It  seems  to me  that  the  degree  of  sogginess  in  the  economy  inthe meeting  five weeks  from now will be  one  issue,  but  I think  anequally  important  issue will  be  the path we want  to  put  inflation  on.One way  of  looking  at  the work  on  the Taylor  rule  is,  of  course,  thatpolicy  is  overly  restrictive.  Another way of  looking  at  it  is  thatit's  appropriately  restrictive because we  want  to  bend inflation downfurther  from here.  Where  that  leads  me  is  that we need  to  have  adiscussion  and try  to  get  agreement  at  some  point  on whether we wantto  try  to  move  toward  lower  inflation deliberately as  opposed  toopportunistically.  I think  that's  a key  issue  and  I don't  have  a wayof  judging what  we ought  to  do  in  December  without  coming  to  someunderstanding about  that.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman,  our  inflation  forecast remainsencouraging.  We  expect  inflation  over  the period to  be a  little  lowerthan  that  forecast  in  the Greenbook.  But  despite  appearing benign  atthis  point,  I think the  inflation picture  requires  careful  andcontinuing monitoring.  I certainly don't want  the  Committee  to  giveup  the  gains  that  we  have  made  against  inflation  in  previous years.11/15/95-50-However,  if  there are  further  improvements  in  inflation  that  exceedour  expectations,  I think a modest  reduction  in  the  federal  funds  ratewould be  called  for.  But  given  the  rapid growth  of  GDP  in  the  thirdquarter,  it  would be very premature  to  reduce  the  funds rate  at  thismeeting;  I don't  think  there  is  any  urgency.  Thus,  it  seemsappropriate  for  the  Committee  to  take  no policy  action  at  this  time,and  I agree with your  recommendation of  "no change"  in  the  funds rate.With  respect  to  the  directive,  although  I personally agree  the  riskson  the  outlook are  on  the  down  side  at  this point,  I would stillsupport  a  symmetric directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  Mr. Chairman,  I can  see  the  argument  that  thereal  fed  funds  rate may be  a tad on  the  high  side, but  I have  to  saythat  so  far it's  hard to  see where  it  has  put much  of  damper  on  creditextensions  or  the  stock market  or  the  housing market.  I can  easilyenvision  the possibility that  events may unfold, conceivably fairlyquickly,  that will  make a policy change  desirable, but  I certainlyfavor  "no change"  for  now.  There  are  two broad reasons  in my mind  forhaving an  asymmetric directive,  the  second  building on  the  first.  Thefirst  is  to  send a signal  about  some  imminent perceived risk.  Thesecond  is  to  facilitate an  imminent policy move.  I just  don't  seeeither  of  those  as  germane right  now, and  consequently I wouldstrongly prefer  a symmetric  directive.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Lindsey.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  On  the Taylor  rule,  Ithink  that  even  if  we were  to  take  it  at  face  value,  it  impliesdownward pressure  on  inflation.  It  has  an  implied  inflation  target  of2 percent.  Current  monetary policy appears  to  be  tight  on  that  rule,but even  if  it  were  on  the money  it  would be putting  downward pressureon  inflation.  So,  on  the basis  of  the  Taylor  rule,  current monetarypolicy  is  tighter  than simply  putting downward pressure  on  inflation.My  second  thought  is  on  the  yield curve.  Governor Blinder  mentionedthe  four  reasons  why we  had a bond market  rally.  One  is  not  only  ato  drop.  I suppose Jerry would  agree  that  either  the  staff  is  rightor  the bond market  is  right.  The bond market  also  sees  an  increasedchance  of  federal  deficit  reduction.  It  sees  a weakening expansion.And here  I suppose  the  length  of  the  tooth becomes  important.Although  there  are not  the  excesses  in  the  economy  that  suggestextreme  risks  to  the  expansion, what  happens  as  the  tooth  lengthens--is  that  the way to  say it?  Help  me  out.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  It  lengthens.

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  It  lengthens!  My  teeth are  going  the  otherway!  [Laughter]  Well,  as  the  tooth  lengthens,  increased  risks beginto  appear  and we  may already have  detected  some.  I think  the  consumeris  one  of  those  risks.  The  international  picture  is  another, be  itinstability  in Japan  and Europe, which  I don't  see  as  growing,  or  inMexico.  The risk  of  a fiscal  misstep  is  still  another  that  could tipthe  economy  over.  So,  I see  the yield  curve as  signalling  that  infact  we  should be  reducing  rates  today.  I also want  to  associatemyself  with Governor  Blinder  in  the  "let's not  get  caught  flatfooted"waiting  for  the  Congress  and  the  President  to  act.  It  is  conceivable11/15/95-51-that  they will  not produce  a  fiscal  agreement  for  fiscal  1996.  Thegovernment  could be  operating  on a continuing resolution forever.  So,we  certainly don't want  to  wait  that  long.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Less  than  forever  is  better.

[SECTION]

MR.  LINDSEY.  Less  than  forever  is  better, yes.  I thinktoday actually would be  a very opportune  time to  move  for  exactly thatreason.  The public  disenchantment  with the budget  process  is  high andgoing to  get  higher.  That  in  itself  is  a shock.  But  I think the  Fedwould be  sending a very appropriate  signal  that we  are  above theprocess  in  all  meanings  of  the word  "above."  So  I would support  areduction  in  the  funds  rate  today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Melzer.

[SECTION]

MR. MELZER.  Thanks,  Alan.  I favor  alternative  B.  I believeit  maintains  a stance  of policy that  is  somewhat restrictive.  It  isvery difficult  to  define  exactly how restrictive, but  I think  that'squite  appropriate given  the  inflation outlook.  I would say thatlooking  forward we  need  to be particularly vigilant with  respect  tothe possibility of  rising  inflation expectations  and  inflation.  Forthat  reason,  I strongly prefer a symmetric  directive.  As Al  Broaddusand some  others have  mentioned, asymmetry  at  this  point would signalthat we  are  quite happy with  3 percent  inflation and we  implicitlydefine  that  as  our view of  price stability.  I also agree with whatGary Stern said about  the  importance  of  how we  make decisions  goingforward and having  that  discussion with respect  to  whether we want  toreduce  inflation systematically or  simply act  opportunistically.Finally,  I think that  trying  to  coordinate  our  actions  withdifferent possibilities  on the  fiscal  front based on how  an  actionmight be  perceived later  is  the  wrong way to  think about  the  issue.We  have  to  make the  best  call  we  can today based on  the  fundamentalsas  we  see  them.  If  the  fundamentals  argue that  we  should act  later,we  should worry about  managing perceptions  at  that  time.  I don't hearanybody making  that  case,  but we  have  to be  very careful  that  we don'tjustify an  action  that  is  not  supported by the  fundamentals  and  isbased  instead on  the view  that  the perception  of  what we  did wasbetter  than  if  we  did  act  on  the  fundamentals.

[SECTION]

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I will  reverse  the  trend toward  thelack  of  loquaciousness,  whatever  that  is.  I am somewhat  surprised bythe commentary  today because  I thought  one  of  the  things  that wemanaged  to  do  at  the  February 1994  meeting was  to move  away  from  fine-11/15/95-52-tuning  the  economy from one  quarter  to  the next  and  toward  ananticipatory monetary policy.  If  that's  so, we ought  to  be moreworried about what  happens  a year from  now or two  years  from now  thanwe are  about  what  happens next  week, about which we  can do  nothing.Based  on my own Bank's  view of  the  economy  in  late  1996  and  1997,  Ithink the  appropriate  thing  to  do  today would be  to  ease.  At  the sametime,  the  confusion  created by  the very  strong  third quarter  and whatit  may tell  us  about  the  economy going  forward  is  sufficient  to  moveme  to  the point  of being  comfortable with doing nothing at  thismeeting.  But  I am sufficiently convinced  of  the  likelihood  thatmonetary policy is  too  tight  and therefore has  to  be  adjusted  that  Iwould prefer  an  asymmetric  directive toward  easing.  It's  alwaysdifficult  for me  to  get  overly  excited about  symmetry or  lack  ofsymmetry, but  I think  the latter would make more sense  in  terms  ofbeing  consistent with  an anticipatory monetary policy.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan.

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  We  moved to  the  6 percent  level  on  the  fundsrate  at  the beginning  of  this year  in  the  context  of  coming off  a yearof  over  4 percent  real  growth.  The  final  quarter of  last  year  saw 5percent real  growth.  Not only  the central  tendency of  the  inflationforecasts  of  this  group  for  1995  but  also  the  forecasts  of a  largemajority of  business  economists,  the  Blue  Chip  list,  The Wall  StreetJournal  list,  and  so  on  had inflation accelerating considerably  in1995.  Now,  if  6 percent  was  the  correct  level  in retrospect  to  haveprevented the  overshooting and spillover  of  excess  demand and  rise  inprices  that  some people were worried  about and we  have  now downshiftedinto  a period  of  slower  real  growth  and maybe  less  adverse  inflationconsequences,  then  clearly  the nominal  6 percent  federal  funds  ratewas  too high  or  too  high  to be  sustained.  It  was  the  right  level  tofoster the  downshift, but  it  has  become  increasingly restrictive  asthe economy  has  decelerated toward growth  in  the  area  of 2 percent.So,  I thought  the  fed  funds  rate  decline  of  1/4 percentage  point  inwere  less  concerned about  future  inflation.When  I look at  the  Greenbook  forecast  and  the  assumption  of  a5-3/4 percent  funds  rate  for  the next  two  years,  I say these  don'tcompute.  Either  the  nominal  GDP  forecast  in  the  Greenbook--and somesplit between output  and prices--is wrong, or  that  5-3/4 percent  fundsrate  is  too high.  So,  I would  like  to  be  able  to  decide  when theright  time  to  lower  the  funds  rate may be--not  to  ease  policy, not  tomake  it  more  stimulative, but when to  avoid having it  becomeinadvertently more restrictive  than  it  should be  to  get  to  ourobjective.  My problem  is  that  the Greenbook's  projection  of  inflationat  a 3 percent  rate  forever  doesn't  give  us  a good basis  for  loweringthe  funds  rate.  For  us  to  lower  the  funds  rate when  the  Greenbookprojection  is  at  3 percent  inflation--and  it  seems  that  a majority  ofthis  group  thinks  that's  about  right--would be  to  send  the  wrongmessage  even  if  we  are  trying  to  maintain  the  same  thrust  of  policy bylowering  the  funds  rate.  So,  either  I have  to  argue  that  I amconvinced  that  inflation  is  going  to  be  lower  than  the  Greenbookprojection  and try  to  be  persuasive--which  I am  not prepared  to do--orelse  I have  to  acquiesce  and say that  a  3 percent  inflation  rate  isacceptable--and I am not prepared  to  do  that  either.  So,  while  Iwould like  to  be  arguing  in  favor of  lowering  the  funds  rate  I don't11/15/95-53-have  a criterion for  doing  so  and  I am stuck with saying  leave  italone until we  come up with  a good rationale  for  lowering  it.

MS. YELLEN.  I would associate myself with  the  analysispresented by  Presidents Forrestal  and McDonough  and Governor  Blinder,although, Mr.  Chairman, at  the  end of  the  day  I support your policysuggestion  for  "no change"  at  today's  meeting.  I continue  to  think,for  reasons  I have  given before,  that  the  real  funds  rate  remains  onthe high  side,  especially  from  the  longer-term perspective  ofsupporting growth  toward  the  end of  the  forecast  period.  I certainlywould admit  that  the  staff  analysis  this  time  around has  created  somedoubts  in  my mind and  I would value having additional  information toresolve  some  of  those doubts.  At  the  end of  the  day, therefore,  I cancertainly support  your suggestion of  "B."  On the  symmetry  issue,because  I see  the  risk as  being on  the  down  side  from  that  longer-termperspective,  I would prefer an  asymmetric directive  although  I do  notthink that  we will  need  to  move during  the  intermeeting period  in  theabsence  of  a  significant  shock.  So,  symmetry could certainly be  anacceptable  outcome.  I am worried about  becoming  frozen by  the budgetnegotiations  and  also  appearing  at  the  end of  the  day to  be  ratifyingsome Congressional  actions.  I think  that  concern  does  tend to  supportGovernor Lindsey's  suggestion of  a move  today.  However,  in the  endthere  are  enough uncertainties  in my mind about  the  forecast  that  onthose  grounds  I would not  favor  a move  today.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  As  I read  it,  the  modal value  of  thisgroup's  preferences  is  marginally  "B" symmetric.  That's where  I senseit  to  be  and I will  propose  that  sort  of  directive  for  a vote.

MR.  BERNARD.  The  draft  of  the  operational paragraph  is  onimmediate  future,  the  Committee  seeks  to maintain  the  existing  degreeof  pressure on  reserve positions.  In  the  context  of  the Committee'slong-run objectives  for price  stability and  sustainable economicgrowth, and giving  careful  consideration  to  economic,  financial,  andmonetary developments,  slightly greater  reserve  restraint  or  slightlylesser  reserve  restraint would be  acceptable  in  the  intermeetingperiod.  The  contemplated reserve  conditions  are  expected to  beconsistent with moderate  growth  in  M2  and M3  over  coming months."
