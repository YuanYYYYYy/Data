Monetary Policy, Stability and Structural Change    Speech given by  Paul Tucker, Executive Director for Markets and Member of the Monetary Policy  Committee, Bank of England    At the Confederation of British Industry, Guildford  1 March 2005          1    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspxMonetary policy, stability and structural change In this speech,(1) Paul Tucker,(2) Executive Director for Markets and a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, discusses structural changes affecting the UK economy and confronting policymakers.  That pervasive change has occurred is evident in, for example, lower variability in output growth and inflation;  less inertia in inflation;  and uncertainty about the extent to which demand pressures feed through into wages and prices.  The underlying forces affecting firms’ price and wage-setting behaviour include more flexible labour markets, more complete capital markets, globalisation, the IT revolution — and also monetary regime change itself, which makes it easier for businesses and consumers to distinguish relative price changes from more generalised price inflation.  Disentangling the effects of such structural shifts from cyclical influences on the economy is a major challenge, which highlights the uncertainty facing policymakers.  Against that background, Mr Tucker points out that debates about cyclical conditions often lie well within the margins of error of any sensible estimate of underlying trends; and that a sense of perspective is needed about month-to-month deviations from the inflation target. Over the medium term, well-anchored inflation expectations are vital to the regime.  But policy credibility cannot be assumed.  It has to be achieved, and continually re-achieved, by policymakers — through actions, and reasoned explanations of those actions. Judging by the macroeconomic data, either there have Chart1 been some fairly profound changes in our economy or Absolute changesin quarterlyinflation Percentage points we have been blessed by extraordinary good luck over 6.0 the past decade or so.  GDP has grown without interruption for 50 quarters.  Unemployment has fallen RPI 5.0 from around 101/2% in 1992 to 61/2% in 1997, and just Consumption deflator 4.0 over 41/ % on the latest reading.  Inflation fell through 2 the first half of the 1990s, and since 1997 has, on 3.0 average, been close to the Government’s target.  All that is, of course, well known.   2.0 But it may be less familiar that quarter-to-quarter 1.0 changes in output growth and inflation have over recent 0.0 years exhibited a strikingly different pattern from those 1960 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 2000 of previous decades.

Namely, that firms charge a mark up, or profit margin, over the marginal costs of One of the most encouraging features of the post-1997 their various inputs — labour, capital, raw and landscape has been that, as well as inflation tracking the intermediate materials, etc — with both the mark up target fairly well, expectations of inflation have been well and costs varying according to current and prospective anchored to the target (Chart 4).  Uncertainty about demand conditions.  This is represented schematically, future inflation has also fallen(1)(Chart 5).  It was indeed crudely, in Diagram 1.  The key feature is that different in the past.  A characteristic shared by the when demand rises and firms utilise their capacity more fully and add to their labour force, their costs and  Chart4 prices tend to rise.  That might involve old-fashioned RPI inflation expectations(a) ‘cost-push’ inflation, with firms raising prices to maintain Per cent 8 margins in the face of increased (marginal) costs.  Or firms might initially be able temporarily to raise margins, with labour and other costs later ‘catching up’.  In either 6 Index-linked gilts case, firms and wage bargainers will be influenced by what they think is going to happen to inflation in the 4 future.

Instead, the apparently flat relationship, illustrated in Chart 3, Labour market between unemployment and wage inflation is, at least in For most businesses, their workforce accounts for the part, most probably a symptom of the sustainable level of major part of their input costs (Chart 6).

However, the 25 available data do not really enable us to get beyond anecdote and speculation. 20 Financing Another important input for firms is finance — for 15 working capital and investment.

That can be illustrated by the current conjuncture.  Over the past few years, there have been at least two other One characterisation of the past would be that firms and influences at work.  First, for some years we enjoyed an households depended on bank loans for external improvement in our ‘terms of trade’.  That meant, simply finance;  and that banks loosened or tightened credit put, that the aggregate price of the goods and services conditions sharply in the different phases of a business we produce and export rose relative to the aggregate cycle, reining back when the economy suffered a prices of our imports.  This increased the purchasing downturn and arrears and losses mounted.

To the extent that this explanation should be given any weight, it would tend to be a temporary factor, Although the stability of output growth over the recent pointing to an upside risk to earnings growth looking past happily deprives us of a proper test, there are ahead. reasons to think that cyclical swings in the availability of finance may now be somewhat less marked than in the A second apparent feature of our environment works the past.  In the first place, the greater stability brought by other way round.  Anecdotally, the role of migrant labour the new monetary regime may make a difference.

There is 40 perhaps some circumstantial evidence of that in, for example, the decline in margins on personal loans  20 (Chart 10).  That would tend to reduce the credit constraints facing households.

A topical example is the risk premium priced into financial instruments.  To pick  4 just one indicator, corporate credit spreads have been falling for a few years, to levels that last prevailed in the 2 mid-1990s (Chart 12).
