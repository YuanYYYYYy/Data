Macro, Asset Price and Financial System Uncertainties     Roy Bridge Memorial Lecture given by  Paul Tucker, Executive Director for Markets and Monetary Policy Committee member,  Bank of England    11 December 2006            1    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx122 Quarterly Bulletin  2007 Q1 Macro, asset price, and financial system uncertainties In this lecture,(1)Paul Tucker,(2)Executive Director for Markets and Monetary Policy Committee member, discusses three related ‘arenas’ of uncertainty concerning the impact of structural changes in the economy and financial system.  Beginning with the macroeconomy and against the background of his vote at the Monetary Policy Committee’s November meeting, he looks at the challenges confronting policymakers from supply-side changes in the United Kingdom such as migration and globalisation, and stresses that the response of policymakers depends crucially on whether medium-term inflation expectations are well anchored.  After exploring possible explanations for the volatility of financial-asset returns having fallen by rather less than macroeconomic volatility, he considers the limited degree of forward-looking uncertainty about asset prices implied by financial option prices.  Noting that part of the explanation may lie in developments in the structure of the financial system, and in particular the process of disintermediation of the banking system, he examines the implications for assessments of money and credit conditions and of the resilience of the financial system as a whole.  Bringing those uncertainties together raises questions about how markets and the system would respond if some of the risks to the outlook were to crystallise.  Though the answers are unknowable, he emphasises that central bankers must strive to maintain the medium-term credibility of monetary policy;  and must understand today’s global banking system and capital markets well enough to tell the difference between a problem requiring solely a macroeconomic response and a more complex financial stability problem. It is a great privilege to give this lecture, named in honour of efficiency brought by recent changes in the structure of the Roy Bridge, for many years a very distinguished head of foreign financial system, they also issue warnings about associated exchange at the Bank of England and the first President of your threats to systemic stability. association, the ACI.

First, while monetary authorities are commonly given some of the credit for the return of macroeconomic stability, central bankers themselves devote a great deal of effort to conveying what they see as risks to the outlook.  Second, while some (1) Given at the Roy Bridge Memorial Lecture delivered on 11 December 2006 at the ACI distinguished commentators see a puzzle in lower macro — Financial Markets Association Annual Conference, Honorary Royal Artillery volatility not having been matched by an equally large decline Company, London.

And, most potently, if more workers were to be attracted in to the country as aggregate demand expands, the uncertainties economy’s productive capacity would expand as well.  In that case, it would probably be harder for firms to raise prices, The characteristics of the Great Stability, as some economists although they may still be able to restore margins by bearing call it,(1)are by now familiar.  Essentially, low inflation on down on costs, especially labour costs.

Yet policymakers also stress a wide range of uncertainties, Indeed, under the Alternative Story, there could well be threatening at least interruptions to the benign conditions of challenges for monetary policy, which in its modern mode the past decade or so.  This is not just an occupational operates essentially by using Bank Rate to regulate aggregate disposition of central bankers.  To varying degrees, these demand relative to aggregate supply, exploiting a short-run uncertainties do feature in real-world policy debates.  I have trade-off between growth and inflation so long as inflation argued previously(3)that some risks — such as those posed by expectations are well anchored.  If aggregate supply were to global current account imbalances — could not sensibly be become endogenous in the way I have described, the short-run factored in to policy settings ahead of their crystallising.  But trade-off might well be less pronounced for a while.  That uncertainties about the structure of the economy and how would make it harder to judge inflationary pressures from monetary policy works do somehow have to feature in our gauging the amount of slack in the economy;  and harder for policy judgements, as I can illustrate with the thinking behind the Bank to achieve our 2% inflation target by broadly steering my vote at the MPC’s November meeting.(4) Essentially, I demand conditions.  In that scenario, it would matter balanced two quite different, but quite likely, views of the enormously that wage and price-setters continued to act on outlook, which I shall label Orthodox and Alternative. the basis that CPI inflation would remain in line with the 2% target over the medium term. Under both stories, private sector demand growth has been reasonably robust and looks, according to surveys and the For me, both the Orthodox and Alternative Stories are Bank’s regional Agents, to continue to be robust for a little plausible.  In that sense, I think the outlook is ‘bimodal’ — in while at least.  Notwithstanding the US slowdown, world terms of there being two main stories.  The Orthodox Story, to growth weighted for its significance to UK trade has which I gave most weight in my November vote, required a remainedsolid, due largely to recovery in the euro area. small tightening.  The implications of the Alternative Story for Business investment appears to be recovering.  And policy were less clear.  I concluded that it was essential for the consumption, although in the near term subject to upside MPC to act in a way that was most likely to keep inflation risksfrom the housing market but downside risks from expectations anchored.

At least for the UK market, it does not obviously lend support to the volatile than in the past, so it is not obvious that equity suggestion in some earlier papers that there may have been an underlying increase in volatility would otherwise have remained higher than idiosyncratic volatility.

For equities, fluctuations in equity risk premia The market’s assessment of such risks can perhaps be gauged may have been a factor, driven by the dotcom/telecom fad and by looking at how much of the current option-implied shifts in global investor preferences.
