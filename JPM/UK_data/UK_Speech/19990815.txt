The Asian Crisis: lessons for crisis management and  prevention    Speech given by  Professor Brealey, special advisor to the Governor on financial stability    15 August 1999              1    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspxThe Asian crisis: lessons for crisis management and prevention In this speech,(1) Professor Brealey, special adviser to the Governor on financial stability issues,(2) discusses the succession of financial crises that swept through Asia, Russia and Latin America in 1997 and 1998, and the resulting considerable debate about both the role of the IMF and possible actions to limit further crises.  Some have argued that international financial markets do not function well and are subject to periodic contagious panics that can be stemmed by an international lender of last resort. Professor Brealey argues that the IMF has neither the resources nor the superior information to fulfil such a role.  However, there may be a need for an international financial institution that can use its leverage to secure policy changes in the affected countries.  Professor Brealey also takes issue with the view that the IMF is simply bailing out imprudent international banks and that measures are needed to bail them back in again.  He argues that the source of the Asian crisis lay in the real economy, but the effect of the crisis was greatly exacerbated by the financial structure of the affected countries.  In particular, much of the risk was borne by domestic banks which borrowed dollars in the short-term interbank market and made longer-term loans in the local currency.  Public policy needs to be directed to ensuring that the risks in emerging markets are distributed efficiently across foreign and domestic investors.  That involves greater use of equity finance and structured debt. Introduction The fact that IMF support has been a response to the withdrawal of funds by international banks (and capital Woody Allen in a graduation day speech remarked: flight by domestic investors) has led to concern that the IMF is simply bailing out the banks,and thus to calls for a ‘More than any other time in history,mankind faces a redistribution of the burden.  This view seems to be crossroads.  One path leads to despair and utter coloured by the assumption that international banking is not hopelessness.  The other to total extinction.  Let us pray we a competitive activity,so that the banks are able to collect have the wisdom to choose correctly’. economic rents from the IMF’s assistance.  Proposals for burden-sharing also assume that the form of private sector The international financial institutions must have felt that lending would be unaffected by attempts to ‘bail in’the they confronted a similar predicament when faced by the private sector.  A related concern is that the prospect of IMF successive financial crises in Asia,Russia and Brazil.  These assistance to troubled countries leads to a moral hazard events have prompted renewed debate about crisis problem on the part of both lenders and borrowers.  This prevention and resolution.  In particular,it has been argued moral hazard argument does not sit well with the huge that the IMF should serve as an international equivalent of losses that have been made by foreign investors in the the domestic lender of last resort that can assist countries hit affected countries,nor with the extreme reluctance on the by a creditor panic or currency flight.  The difficulties for part of borrowers to seek IMF assistance. the IMF in fulfilling this role are its relative lack of resources and the problem of distinguishing between the The strong limitations on the international community to illiquid and the insolvent borrower.  Moreover,as is shown resolve a major international financial crisis suggest that the later,the response of asset prices to the announcement of focus of public policy should be on crisis prevention rather IMF assistance provides little encouragement for the view than resolution.  It is foolish to look for a single panacea. that the IMF’s intervention helps countries to resolve a Debate has focused inter aliaon alternative exchange rate problem of financial panics.  An alternative role for the IMF systems,the structure of banking and bank supervision in is to use its leverage to enforce policy changes on affected emerging markets,and on the systems of corporate countries.  This role does not assume that a country’s governance and control (‘crony capitalism’).  Rather less creditors are subject to contagious panics,and the form and attention has been paid to the issues of capital structure.

IMF ‘bail-out.’ Thus the case for an international lender of last resort One of the roles envisaged for the IMF,and suggested in depends heavily on the lender’s access to superior Stanley Fischer’s 1999 paper,is as an international information on the solvency of the country’s banking equivalent of the domestic lender of last resort.(1) The system.  function of the domestic lender of last resort is to prevent destabilising runs on the banking system.  One way that this Unlike a domestic lender of last resort,the IMF’s ability to could arise is from a liquidity mismatch.  For example,a respond to a liquidity run is limited by its lack of resources. bank may be solvent as long as all depositors agree to For example,between 1992 and 1996 the net amount maintain their investment,but subject to a run if each disbursed by the IMF under the Standby Arrangements and depositor is concerned that others are about to withdraw Extended Fund Facilities was about $18 billion.

Here also withdrawn from emerging markets. (1) See also Sachs (1995). (2) The role of a lender of last resort in preventing liquidity runs was first suggested by Thornton (1802) and developed by Bagehot (1873).  A formal model of bank runs is provided by Diamond and Dybvig (1983). (3) For early models of rational cascades,see Banerjee (1992) and Welch (1992). (4) It is also sometimes argued that an international lender of last resort is needed to counter attempts at market manipulation,or irrational speculation that leads to excess volatility in asset prices. 288The Asian crisis: lessons for crisis management and prevention This lack of resources may be less crucial in the case of a focus on changes in asset values at the time of the solvency run.

An alternative rationale for the IMF is that while private If these results stand up to further analysis,then it is sector lenders may wish to impose conditions on the local difficult to argue that the IMF decision to provide assistance government,they find it difficult to do so.

However,the gains in this case may be linked only weakly with the extent of the support.  It seems unlikely that IMF aid simply goes into the pockets of the international lending banks.  International banking is These two models of the IMF’s role do not sit happily a highly competitive activity and the prospect that IMF together and have different implications for the form of its support may be available in the event of difficulties is likely assistance.  For example,there is little place for staged to be reflected in the interest rates that banks charge.

In practice,there do not appear to be any abnormal in the absence of support.  An alternative approach is to returns in equity prices of international banks,which may (1) The IMF’s experience in dealing with crisis situations may also give it an important consultancy role in determining the appropriate policy response.

The results of the exercise are similar regardless of whether the announcement date is defined either by a news or press release by the IMF,or by press comment that may precede such a release. 289Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: August 1999 suggest either that the IMF assistance is regarded as an heavy losses that investors have taken on their emerging automatic response to a balance of payments crisis and is market books,their caution was right.(1) therefore fully anticipated,or (more likely) that the news of IMF assistance percolates slowly and the amount of the Nor is it clear that the debtors take much comfort in the subsidy is too small to observe. prospect of IMF assistance.  Not only are governments generally reluctant to call on IMF help,but the financial If IMF support does result in an increase in the value of crises in these markets typically impose considerable costs private sector debt,the IMF could try to recapture some of on all the country’s citizens.  In almost all cases,the appeal these value enhancements by arranging,for example,a for IMF assistance has led to considerable domestic unrest, moratorium on private sector debt.

It is difficult therefore to believe that where they have a common interest in renewing their lines. politicians and business people are tempted to pursue This is the crisis manager role that has been described by reckless policies in the belief that they will not suffer the Stanley Fischer (1999).  However,the suggestion of consequences. compulsion would not sit well with the arguments that have been made for an international lender of last resort.  If The role of the IMF in crisis prevention  private sector lenders are reluctant to continue to lend even when the IMF has offered assistance,there is a message that Financial crises have resulted in large wealth losses,but one would do well to heed. there is relatively little that the IMF can do to replace this lost wealth.  Despite the popular image of huge bailouts,the subsidy provided by the IMF (or ‘burden’,in the eyes of its If some form of enforced ‘burden-sharing’was anticipated, critics) is negligible compared with the wealth losses that it would be reflected in higher interest rates on developing the borrowing countries have experienced.  This suggests country debt.  It is also dangerous to assume that the that prevention of international crises should take structure of private sector lending would be independent of precedence over cure. attempts to recapture any value enhancement.  In particular, lenders would have an incentive to structure the debt to make it easier to exit before the imposition of a moratorium. An interesting issue is how far the IMF can play a role This is exactly the opposite of the financial structures that beyond that of an experienced consultant.  One problem for one would like to see in developing countries. the IMF has been that countries are reluctant to seek assistance and do so only as a last resort.  This shows up in the preceding asset returns.  For example,over the two years How serious is the problem of moral hazard? before a country seeks IMF support,equity prices on Critics of the IMF’s role commonly contend that the average experience a relative decline of 35%.  In the case of prospect of IMF assistance leads to a moral hazard problem. bank stocks the relative decline is about 40%.  It is possible, International banks,it is suggested,are tempted to lend therefore,that the need for IMF assistance would be reduced recklessly to emerging markets,and the governments and if countries could be encouraged to make earlier policy banks in these countries are tempted to borrow excessively. changes.  This seems to be the motive behind President The first point to make is that this does not necessarily Clinton’s proposal for contingent credit lines. reduce social welfare;  it is arguable that,given the underdeveloped equity markets in developing economies, Unfortunately,it has proved difficult to devise a scheme that these countries have suffered from a shortage of risk capital maximises the Fund’s ability to influence economic policies rather than an excess.

Two features of the financial structure in the Unlike equity,debt brings with it the risk of default,but debt affected Asian countries were a particular source of instruments may differ in a number of ways that affect the difficulty: allocation of risk: l Many of the banks borrowed dollars and reinvested in l Currency. The recent financial crises have highlighted domestic currency loans.  Their willingness to do so the risks for governments,banks and industrial (1) If financial crises are a consequence of fixed exchange rates,then it is arguable that the IMF should abandon its traditional role of providing funds to countries to defend a currency peg.  This view was expressed forcefully by Robert Rubin (1999). (2) For a discussion of the role of capital controls see,for example,Dooley (1996) and Eichengreen,Mussa,et al(1998). (3) For discussion of these issues,see Myers (1998) and Rajan and Zingales (1998). (4) Institute of International Finance (1999b). (5) While foreign direct investment accounted for about half of private capital inflows into all emerging Asian markets before the crisis,it accounted for only about one sixth of the private flows to the affected countries.  This difference between the liquidity of direct and portfolio investment may go some way towards explaining why some countries were relatively insulated from the shocks that affected other parts of the region.  For example, while China shared the problems of a chronically weak banking system,an ovegeared corporate sector,excess capacity in many industries,and a sharp expansion of domestic credit,the ratio of foreign direct investment to financial investment in China was substantially higher than in the most affected countries (Lardy 1999).  As a result,China did not experience the capital outflows of its neighbours. 291Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: August 1999 companies of unmatched foreign currency borrowing. of the government’s activities,so that the bondholders Clearly,loans between different currency zones must may need to take on part of that risk.

There are some encouraging indications that an increasing proportion of foreign capital in emerging markets is of a While there are dangers in abrupt increases in competition, long-term nature.  For example,foreign direct investment in there is a strong case in many developing economies for emerging markets has increased by 30% a year since 1990, reducing barriers to entry by foreign banks,which would and by 1997 had reached nearly 50% of private capital facilitate direct loans from these banks to corporates,rather inflows to emerging markets (though it remained relatively than by way of the interbank market.

Since 1980 an increasing fraction of the indirect investment Thus a relatively small decline in economic activity led to in emerging markets has been securitised,with the result widespread defaults,the cost of which was borne by the that both equity and bond investment have grown at the banking system. This suggests three further policy aims. (1) As a result of the capital outflow in 1998 from crisis countries,direct investment rose in that year to 84% of net private flows to emerging markets (Institute of International Finance,1999a). (2) This proportion was increased progressively to 50% in December 1997.  Restrictions on foreign investment in long-term Korean corporate bonds have been even more severe.  (3) Between 1990 and 1995 the number of US country funds increased about fivefold and the assets under management increased from $13 billion to $109 billion (Serra (1999)).  For evidence that country funds economise on information costs,see J A Frankel and S L Schmukler,(1997). 293Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: August 1999 The first is to promote greater use of equity finance. certainly misplaced.  International banking is a competitive Deregulation of the underwriting market can help to reduce activity and there is no reason to suppose that the banks the costs of issuing equity,while the supply of equity have been able to appropriate to themselves the (very small) finance can be enhanced by encouraging foreign equity subsidy in IMF loans.

The problem therefore was not that the rather than resolution.  The Asian crisis was prompted by means for hedging were absent,but that Asian corporations huge industrial overcapacity and increasing costs,which led and banks were confident that the currency pegs would be to a sharp fall in profitability.

But currency fluctuations are not the large capital outflows and considerable strains on the only macro risks that threaten corporations and governments domestic banking system.

Where capital consisted of foreign direct investment or equity portfolio investment,capital flows were much more stable and the risk was efficiently pooled with foreign Conclusion investors.
