The effectiveness of vaccination  against long COVID    A rapid evidence briefingKey messages  •  Fifteen studies were identified that reported on the effectiveness of vaccination against  long COVID (search up to 12 January 2022): 7 studies examined whether vaccination  before infection reduced the symptoms or incidence of long COVID, 7 studies examined  whether vaccination in people with long COVID reduced or cleared the symptoms of long  COVID, and 1 study examined both.  •  Six of the 8 studies assessing the effectiveness of vaccination before COVID-19 infection  suggested that vaccinated cases (1 or 2 doses) were less likely to develop symptoms of  long COVID following infection, in the short term (4 weeks after infection), medium term  (12 to 20 weeks after infection) and long term (6 months after infection). As all 8 studies  included only participants who had COVID-19, the effect of vaccination on reduced  incidence of COVID-19 is not accounted for. This means these studies do not give a total  population estimate for the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent long COVID, but rather  underestimate it.  •  From 2 studies that measured individual long COVID symptoms, fully vaccinated cases  were less likely to have the following symptoms in the medium or long term than  unvaccinated cases: fatigue, headache, weakness in arms and legs, persistent muscle  pain, hair loss, dizziness, shortness of breath, anosmia, interstitial lung disease, myalgia,  and other pain.  •  In studies examining the effect of vaccination among people with long COVID, 3 of 4  studies comparing long COVID symptoms before and after vaccination suggested that  more cases reported an improvement in symptoms after vaccination, either immediately  or over several weeks. There were, however, some cases in all studies who reported a  worsening in symptoms after vaccination.   •  Three studies of people with long COVID who were unvaccinated when they were initially  infected, compared people who were subsequently vaccinated and people who remained  unvaccinated. All these studies suggested that people with long-COVID were less likely  to report long COVID symptoms shortly after vaccination, and over longer periods, than  people with long COVID who were not subsequently vaccinated. One study looked at the  timing of vaccination after COVID-19 diagnosis, and suggested that cases who were  vaccinated sooner rather than later after diagnosis were much less likely to report  symptoms of long COVID than cases who remained unvaccinated.   •  In 3 of the 5 studies reporting on symptom changes following vaccination of  people with long COVID, there was a higher proportion of people with long  COVID who reported unchanged symptoms following vaccination (up to 70%)  than people whose symptoms improved or worsened.   •  All studies were observational, so the results may be from differences other than  vaccination, and there was large heterogeneity between studies in the definition of long  COVID.        2Background  Long COVID, also known as post acute sequalae of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and post  COVID-19 syndrome, has several definitions, but typically includes having persistent  symptoms of COVID-19, usually for weeks but potentially for months or years (1, 2).  Symptoms commonly include fatigue, shortness of breath and a persistent cough, although  many other symptoms have been reported (3). As of 6 December 2021, 1.3 million people  in the UK (2% of the population) reported experiencing long COVID symptoms for more  than 4 weeks after the initial infection (4). Vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the risk of  symptomatic COVID-19 infection (5), though vaccination may additionally reduce the risk of  long COVID if a vaccinated person is infected with COVID-19 (1, 2). While there is no  recommendation against vaccination in people with long COVID (6), it is unclear whether  vaccination of previously unvaccinated people with long COVID is more likely to improve or  worsen long COVID symptoms (7, 8).  The purpose of this rapid evidence briefing is to provide evidence relating to the  effectiveness of vaccination against long COVID, both for vaccinations given before  infection with COVID-19 (effectiveness against incidence of long COVID), and for  vaccinations given after infection with COVID-19 and development of long COVID  symptoms (effectiveness for reducing or eliminating symptoms of long COVID).    Methods  A rapid search was undertaken on 12 January 2022 to identify primary studies related to  the effectiveness of vaccination against long COVID. We searched a number of specialist  COVID-19 review repositories and ran a broad search using Medline, Embase, NLM  COVID portfolio (for preprints), WHO COVID Database and Google. As this work was  conducted at pace, data was extracted directly into a narrative summary. The quality criteria  checklist (QCC) tool was used to rate the quality of included studies as low, medium, or  high quality. Full details of the methods are available in Appendix A.    Evidence  Fifteen studies reported on the effectiveness of vaccination against long COVID. Four  studies were conducted in the UK (7-10), 4 studies in the US (11-14), 1 study in France  (15), 2 studies in India (16, 17), 1 study in Indonesia (18), 1 study in Israel (19), and 2  studies were conducted online with participants from multiple countries (20-22). Seven  studies examined whether vaccination before infection reduced the symptoms or incidence  of long COVID (9, 11, 12, 16-19), 7 studies examined whether vaccination in people with  long COVID reduced or cleared the symptoms of long COVID (7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 20-22), and  1 study examined both (13). Table 1 shows the characteristics of each included study.  Most studies used different definitions of long COVID, as such these definitions are given in  the summaries below. In all studies, fully vaccinated is defined as 2 doses of any 2 dose  vaccine or 1 dose of a single dose vaccine, and partially vaccinated is defined as a single  dose of a 2 dose vaccine. Where the vaccine brand (e.g. Pfizer, AstraZeneca) is available,  this is reported.  3Vaccination before infection  Note that all 8 studies included in this section only include participants who had COVID-19,  so the effect of vaccination to reduce incidence of COVID-19 is not accounted for. This  means all studies will likely underestimate the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent long  COVID.  A nested case-control study by Antonelli et al (2022, rated as medium quality) examined  whether vaccination for COVID-19 before infection was associated with long duration  symptoms of COVID-19 (≥28 days) in adults who reported testing positive on RT-PCR or  LFD for COVID-19 on the COVID symptom study phone app (ZOE) between 8 December  2020 and 4 July 2021 in the UK (9). In total, 6,030 participants reported a positive test at  least 14 days after their first vaccination but before their second (partially vaccinated, tested  a median of 67 days after vaccination), and 2,370 at least 7 days after their second vaccine  (fully vaccinated, tested a median of 44 days after vaccination). The same number of  unvaccinated participants who tested positive were matched with those who were partially  and fully vaccinated, accounting for date of positive test, healthcare worker status, sex,  body mass index, and age.   •  Fully vaccinated participants were about half as likely to have symptoms lasting  ≥28 days than unvaccinated participants (odds ratio [OR] = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.32 to  0.82, p=0.005), whereas partially vaccinated participants were about as likely to  have symptoms lasting ≥28 days than unvaccinated participants (OR = 1.04, 95%  CI: 0.86 to 1.25, p=0.69).  •  Fully vaccinated younger adults (18 to 59 years) were much less likely to have  symptoms lasting ≥28 days than younger unvaccinated adults (OR = 0.21, 95%  CI: 0.08 to 0.59, p=0.003).    A retrospective cohort study by Al-Aly et al (2021, preprint, rated as medium quality)  examined whether vaccination for COVID-19 before infection was associated with post- acute sequelae of COVID-19 (symptoms of COVID-19 at 6 months) in adults who had a  positive test for COVID-19 in the United States Veterans Health Administration electronic  health databases between 1 February and 31 August 2021 in the US (12). Vaccinated  cases (n=16,035, mean age of 67 years, 71% White race, 91% male) were matched (and  weighted) with unvaccinated cases (n=48,536, mean age of 56 years, 71% white, 86%  male), accounting for age, race, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking status, health  conditions and information, data of test and hospital information. Post-acute sequalae of  COVID-19 included cardiovascular disorders, coagulation, fatigue, gastrointestinal  disorders, kidney disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, musculoskeletal  disorders, neurologic disorders, and pulmonary disorders.  •  Vaccinated cases were less likely to have at least 1 post-acute sequalae of  COVID-19 at 6 months compared with unvaccinated cases (hazard ratio [HR] =  0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83 to 0.92).     4A retrospective cohort study by Arjun et al (2022, preprint, rated as medium quality)  examined whether vaccination for COVID-19 before infection (confirmed with RT-PCR) was  associated with self-reported long COVID symptoms (including fatigue, cough, loss of taste  and smell and cognitive dysfunction 4 weeks from the date of diagnosis) in adults (≥18  years) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between April and September 2021 in India  (16). In total, 487 participants who tested positive for COVID-19 in a single hospital  responded, with a mean age of 39 years, 41% female, and 59% of participants had 2 doses  of a COVID-19 vaccine (the majority had Covaxin), 17% had 1 dose, and 25% were  unvaccinated. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, occupation, body mass index,  substance use, past COVID-19 infection, comorbidities, number of COVID-19 symptoms  and severity of COVID-19 disease.  •  Fully vaccinated participants were more likely to have long COVID symptoms 4  weeks from the date of diagnosis than unvaccinated participants (OR = 2.32,  95% CI: 1.17 to 4.58, p=0.01).  •  Note that these results are in the opposite direction to all other studies, i.e. that  cases who were fully vaccinated had a greater chance of subsequently  developing long COVID symptoms, and more analysis is needed to understand  why this may be the case.    A retrospective cohort study (POST-COVID) by Herman et al (2022, preprint, rated as  medium quality) examined whether vaccination for COVID-19 before infection with COVID- 19 (confirmed by RT-PCR, Nucleic Acid Amplification Test [NAAT] or rapid antigen test)  was associated with olfactory dysfunction (anosmia or hyposmia) 2 and 4 weeks after the  end of infection in cases recruited up to December 2021 in Indonesia (18). Fully vaccinated  participants (2 doses, n=221, mean age of 32 years, 50% female) more than 14 days  before infection were matched with participants who were not fully vaccinated more than 14  days before infection (including unvaccinated and partially vaccinated cases, n=221, mean  age of 32 years, 50% female), accounting for occupation, education, island, type of living  area, living companion, age and hypertension status.   •  While fully vaccinated participants were less likely to develop olfactory  dysfunction after infection than unvaccinated participants (OR = 0.31, 95% CI:  0.10 to 0.94), there was little evidence for an association between full vaccination  and olfactory dysfunction 4 weeks after the end of infection (p=0.59)    A cross-sectional study nested in a prospective cohort study by Kuodi et al (2022, preprint,  rated as medium quality) examined whether vaccination for COVID-19 before infection was  associated with long-term physical, mental, and psychosocial consequences of COVID-19  in adults who tested positive for COVID-19 (RT-PCR) between 15 March 2020 and 15 June  2021 in Israel (19). Study participants (n=951, 294 fully vaccinated [2 doses], 340 partially  vaccinated [1 dose], 317 unvaccinated), who tested positive for COVID-19 in 1 of 3  government hospitals, completed a survey between 16 July and 18 November 2021  detailing their COVID-19 test results, vaccination status, number of doses, type of vaccine  and date of administration, and symptoms experienced at the time of filling out the survey.  5In total, 337 of 951 participants (35%) reported not fully recovering from the initial COVID- 19 symptoms at follow-up.   •  The study suggested that, compared with unvaccinated participants, participants  with 2 or 3 doses of vaccine were 54% to 83% less likely to report 7 of the 10  most commonly reported symptoms (see below).   •  For most symptoms, the vaccine effectiveness against symptoms reported at  follow-up was highest for older participants (>60 years) and lowest for younger  participants (19 to 35 years), with the exceptions of hair loss (highest in 36 to 60  year olds), persistent cough (similar in all age groups) and feeling fully recovered  from COVID-19 (highest in 19 to 35 year olds).   •  The relative risks (RR) of each symptom, comparing participants who received 2  or 3 doses of vaccine with unvaccinated participants (relative risks <1 indicate  that fewer vaccinated compared with unvaccinated participants had the symptom  at follow-up) were:  o  Fatigue: RR = 0.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.19 to 0.71, p=0.003)  o  Headache: RR = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.26 to 0.83, p=0.01)  o  Weakness in arms and legs: RR = 0.43 (95% CI: 0.20 to 0.94, p=0.03)  o  Persistent muscle pain: RR = 0.32 (95% CI: 0.11 to 0.88, p=0.03)  o  Loss of concentration: RR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.17 to 2.06, p=0.41)  o  Hair loss: RR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.60, p=0.005)  o  Sleeping problems: RR = 0.53 (95% CI: 0.18 to 1.61, p=0.26)  o  Dizziness: RR = 0.26 (95% CI: 0.09 to 1.79, p=0.02)  o  Persistent cough: RR = 0.72 (95% CI: 0.28 to 1.83, p=0.48)  o  Shortness of breath: RR = 0.23 (95% CI: 0.07 to 0.84, p=0.03)  o  Feeling fully recovered from COVID-19: RR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.80 to 1.21, p=0.86)    A cross-sectional study by Senjam et al (2021, preprint, rated as medium quality) examined  whether vaccination for COVID-19 before infection was associated with symptoms of long  COVID (symptoms present between 4 and 12 weeks [short-term] or beyond 12 weeks  [long-term] after a positive RT-PCR or cartridge based NAAT) in adults (≥18 years) who  tested positive for COVID-19 between 1 January and 30 April 2021 in India (17). A total of  773 participants, who tested positive in a single hospital, completed a survey between June  and July 2021 (median age of 34 years, 56% male, 33% with short-term long COVID  symptoms, 13% with long-term long COVID symptoms, 53% unvaccinated, 25% fully  vaccinated [2 doses]). The most commonly reported long COVID symptoms were fatigue,  pain in the joints and muscle, hair loss, headache, cough, breathlessness, sleep disorders,  sore throat and decrease of smell and taste.  •  Fully vaccinated (2 doses) participants were less likely to have long COVID  symptoms (not stated if these were short-term, long-term or both) than  unvaccinated participants (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.85)    6A retrospective cohort study by Simon et al (2021, preprint, rated as high quality) examined  whether vaccination for COVID-19 before or after infection was associated with long COVID  (COVID-19 symptoms present between 12 and 20 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis) in  cases who were diagnosed with, or tested positive for (NAAT or antigen test), COVID-19  between 1 January 2020 and 31 May 2021 in the US (13). In total, 240,648 cases were  included, 220,460 (92%) cases were unvaccinated by 12 weeks after their COVID-19  diagnosis, 2,392 (1.0%) cases received 1 dose of vaccine before their diagnosis, and  17,796 (7.4%) cases received 1 dose of vaccine within 12 weeks of their diagnosis. COVID- 19 symptoms included: chest pain, palpitations, altered mental state, anorexia, chills,  fatigue, fever, malaise, loss of sense of smell, loss of sense of taste, nasal congestion, sore  throat, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, digestive changes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, muscle  weakness, general weakness, myalgia, headache, cough and dyspnoea.  •  Cases who were vaccinated before diagnosis were much less likely to have any  symptoms of long COVID between 12 and 20 weeks after diagnosis than cases  who were unvaccinated up to 12 weeks after their diagnosis (OR = 0.22, 95% CI:  0.20 to 0.25, p<0.005), and even less likely to have more than 1 symptom of long  COVID (OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.14, p<0.005)    A matched case-control study by Taquet et al (2021, preprint, rated as high quality)  examined whether vaccination for COVID-19 before infection (confirmed diagnosis or  positive RT-PCR test) was associated with documented consequences of COVID-19 in  people in the 6 months after an infection, with infection occurring between 1 January and 31  August 2021, primarily in the US (11). Data was obtained from TriNetX Analytics, which  contains data from 59 healthcare organisations and 81 million patients. In total, 9,479  vaccinated cases (n=2,996 with 1 dose and n=6,957 with 2 doses of any vaccine received  at least 14 days before infection during the study) were matched with the same number of  unvaccinated cases (who had received an influenza vaccine), accounting for age, sex,  ethnicity, obesity, socioeconomic deprivation and specific health conditions, as well as date  of infection. The mean age of participants was 57 years, 59% were female, and of those  who were vaccinated, 65% had the Pfizer vaccine, 9% the Moderna vaccine, 1.6% the  Janssen vaccine, and 24% had an unspecified vaccine. A composite long COVID outcome  was defined as having a diagnosis of any of the following symptoms in the 6 months after  infection: abdominal symptoms, abnormal bleeding, anxiety/depression, chest/throat pain,  cognitive symptoms, fatigue, headache, myalgia and other pain, as well as death (to  account for differences in survival between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants).  •  The study suggested there was no association between vaccination (comparing  participants with 2 doses of vaccine with unvaccinated participants) and the  composite long COVID outcome in the 6 months after infection: hazard ratio (HR)  = 1.00 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.06); 64.9% and 65.6% of vaccinated and unvaccinated  participants had a long COVID symptom respectively.  •  However, participants with 2 doses of vaccine, when compared with unvaccinated  participants, were less likely to be diagnosed with:  o  Anosmia: HR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.84, p=0.0004)  o  Fatigue: HR = 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77 to 0.96, p=0.005)   7o  Hair loss: HR = 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54 to 0.81, p<0.0001)  o  Interstitial lung disease: HR = 0.74 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.88, p=0.0006)   o  Myalgia: HR = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.84, p<0.0001)  o  Other pain: HR = 0.85 (95% CI: 0.76 to 0.96, p=0.007)    Vaccination after infection  A prospective cohort by Arnold et al (2021, preprint, rated as medium quality) examined the  effect of vaccination (with Pfizer or AstraZeneca) on long COVID symptoms in previously  unvaccinated participants who were hospitalised with COVID-19 in April and May 2020 and  either remained unvaccinated or were vaccinated (Pfizer or AstraZeneca) in January or  February 2021 in the UK (7). Vaccinated participants (n=44, median age 64 years, 64%  male, 82% symptomatic 8 months after infection) were matched with unvaccinated  participants (n=22, median age 55 years, 59% male, 82% symptomatic 8 months after  infection), accounting for symptomatology and quality of life at 8 months after infection, and  all participants were asked about whether they had symptoms, and whether they had  improved, stayed the same, or worsened following vaccination.   •  At 1 month after vaccination (or a matched time for unvaccinated cases), more  vaccinated participants reported their symptoms improved than unvaccinated  participants (23.2% versus 15.4%), and fewer vaccinated participants reported  their symptoms worsened than unvaccinated participants (25.6% versus 14.3%,  p=0.035 for all differences). A similar percentage of vaccinated and unvaccinated  participants had unchanged symptoms (71.1% versus 70.3%).    A prospective cohort (the Office of National Statistics COVID-19 infection survey [CIS])  study by Ayoubkhani et al (2021, preprint, rated as high quality) examined the effect of  vaccination on long COVID symptoms in previously unvaccinated adults (18 to 69 years)  between 3 February and 5 September 2021 in the UK (8). Participants in the CIS were  randomly sampled from UK households, and were visited monthly to both provide a swab  for RT-PCR testing and to be asked if they would describe themselves are currently  experiencing long COVID (in this analysis, symptoms persisting at least 12 weeks from a  confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection that could not be explained by another health  condition). All participants had their first vaccine dose by 5 September 2021 (n=28,356),  45.7% after 3 February 2021, and 83.8% had their second vaccine dose by 5 September  2021 (n=23,753). There were 6,729 participants (23.7%) that reported they had long COVID  symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle ache, weakness or tiredness, nausea or  vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, loss of taste, loss of smell, sore  throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, vertigo or dizziness, worry or  anxiety, low mood or not enjoying anything, trouble sleeping, memory loss or confusion, or  difficulty concentrating.   •  Both the first and second vaccine doses were associated with reduced odds of  reporting long COVID symptoms shortly after vaccination:  o  First vaccine dose: OR = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81 to 0.93, p<0.001)  o  Second vaccine dose: OR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86 to 0.97, p=0.003)  8o  The second vaccine dose was also associated with a long-term decrease  in the odds of reporting long COVID symptoms (p=0.03)  •  The results were similar for activity limiting long COVID (n=4,747 reported activity  limiting long COVID):  o  First vaccine dose: OR = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81 to 0.96, p=0.003)  o  Second vaccine dose: OR = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84 to 0.98, p=0.01)  o  The second vaccine dose was also associated with a long-term decrease  in the odds of reporting long COVID symptoms (p=0.03)  •  There was little evidence for differences in results between mRNA and adenovirus  vaccine types, and the results suggested that the odds of experiencing most  symptoms of long COVID decreased with the first and second doses of vaccine,  though these results were relatively imprecise.    A prospective cohort study by Gaber et al (2021, rated as medium quality) asked health  care workers in the UK with long COVID whether vaccination between December 2020 and  January 2021 changed their long COVID symptoms (10). Of 67 healthcare workers with  long COVID receiving the vaccine, 75% had fatigue, 53% had shortness of breath, and 18%  had anxiety.   •  Several weeks after vaccination, 14 (21%) participants reported an improvement  in 1 or more of their symptoms, 8 (12%) participants reported a worsening in  symptoms, and 45 (67%) participants reported no change in their symptoms.    An online survey (LongCovidSOS) by Strain et al (2021, preprint, rated as medium quality)  asked people in the UK and elsewhere with long COVID (positive RT-PCR or antigen test  not required) whether their symptoms improved or worsened following vaccination (21, 22).  The survey was completed by 812 respondents (96% above 30 years old, 80% women) in  March and April 2021, 41% of participants had a confirmed COVID-19 infection, 50% had  the AstraZeneca vaccine, 40% the Pfizer vaccine, 8.6% the Moderna vaccine, 14% had 2  doses of any vaccine, and 40% of participants had at least 30 days between their last  vaccine and completing the survey. Long COVID symptoms included fatigue, brain fog,  myalgia, shortness of breath, insomnia, chest pain or palpitations, gastrointestinal  symptoms, anosmia, autonomic dysfunction, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome,  persistent cough, fever, rash (including COVID toes) and vascular complications.  •  57% of participants reported an improvement in symptoms after vaccination, 25%  of participants reported no change in symptoms, while 19% of participants  reported a worsening of symptoms, with Moderna having the most participants  report an improvement and least report a deterioration.   •  When responses to individual symptoms were grouped together, more  participants had all or some of their symptoms improve than worsen:   o  All improved: 11%  o  Some improved: 16%  o  Mixture: 24%  o  No change: 42%  9o  Some got worse: 3.8%  o  All got worse: 2.9%    An online survey by Scherlinger et al (2022, rated as medium quality) asked French- speaking adults with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, persistent symptoms lasting  >4 weeks after probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection and no alternative diagnosis to  explain the symptoms) whether their symptoms improved or worsened following vaccination  (Pfizer [78%], Moderna [16%], AstraZeneca [4%]) (20). The survey was completed by 567  respondents (median age 44 years, 83% women) in August 2021, 64% of participants had  a confirmed COVID-19 infection, 25% had one vaccine dose and 45% had 2 vaccine doses.  Symptoms of PASC included fever or chills, fatigue, brain fog, headaches, changing mood  or impact on morale, sleeping issues, costal pain, dyspnoea, cough, palpitations, muscle  aches, joint pain, paraesthesia or tingling, anosmia or ageusia, diarrhoea or vomiting,  spontaneous bruises, and pruritus.  •  Of the 380 participants who reported long COVID at the time of vaccination, 117  (31%) reported a global worsening of symptoms (including fever/chills [74%],  gastro-intestinal symptoms [70%], paraesthesia [64%] and arthralgia [63%]),  whereas 83 (21.8%) reported a global improvement in symptoms (including  anosmia [62%] and brain fog [51%]), and 179 (47%) reported no change in  symptoms following vaccination.  •  The symptoms thought to be affected by vaccination persisted for more than 2  weeks after vaccination in 64% of participants reporting a worsening in  symptoms, and in 73% of participants reporting an improvement.   •  There was little evidence of differences in results between vaccine types (p=0.60)    A retrospective cohort study by Simon et al (2021, preprint, rated as high quality), detailed  above, examined whether vaccination for COVID-19 before or after infection was  associated with long COVID (COVID-19 symptoms present between 12 and 20 weeks after  COVID-19 diagnosis) in cases who were diagnosed with, or tested positive for (NAAT or  antigen test), COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 and 31 May 2021 in the US (13).  •  Cases who were vaccinated 0 to 4 weeks after diagnosis were much less likely to  have any symptoms of long COVID between 12 and 20 weeks after diagnosis  than cases who were unvaccinated up to 12 weeks after their diagnosis (OR =  0.38, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.41, p<0.005), and even less likely to have more than 1  symptom of long COVID (OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.22, p<0.005)  •  Cases who were vaccinated 4 to 8 weeks after diagnosis were less likely to have  any symptoms of long COVID between 12 and 20 weeks after diagnosis than  cases who were unvaccinated up to 12 weeks after their diagnosis (OR = 0.54,  95% CI: 0.51 to 0.57, p<0.005), and much less likely to have more than 1  symptom of long COVID (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.35, p<0.005)  •  Cases who were vaccinated 8 to 12 weeks after diagnosis were less likely to  have any symptoms of long COVID between 12 and 20 weeks after diagnosis  10than cases who were unvaccinated up to 12 weeks after their diagnosis (OR =  0.75, 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.78, p<0.005), and much less likely to have more than 1  symptom of long COVID (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.49, p<0.005)    A prospective cohort (ComPaRe long COVID cohort) study by Tran et al (2021, preprint,  rated as high quality) examined the effect of vaccination on long COVID symptoms in adults  (≥18 years old) who had a COVID-19 infection (confirmed or suspected) and subsequent  long COVID symptoms (symptoms persisting >3 weeks past initial infection) between  November 2020 and May 2021 in France (15). Participants (n=910, median age of 47  years, 80.5% female, median of 10.7 months of symptoms) were contacted every 60 days  and asked about 53 COVID-19 symptoms (to form a COVID ST score, from 0 to 53,  representing the number of different symptoms), and every 45 days and asked about  vaccination status. Vaccinated (n=455) and unvaccinated (n=455) participants were  matched on sex, age, education, comorbidities, confirmed COVID-19 infection,  hospitalisation for COVID-19, time from COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 symptoms.   •  Long COVID symptoms were less severe in vaccinated compared with  unvaccinated participants 120 days after recruitment (mean difference in COVID  ST score = -1.8, 95% CI: -2.5 to -1.0), and more vaccinated than unvaccinated  participants had remission of all long COVID symptoms (16.6% versus 7.5%, HR  = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.23 to 3.15)  •  The impact of long COVID on the lives of vaccinated participants was also less than  unvaccinated participants (mean difference in COVID impact score = -3.3, 95% CI:  -6.2 to -0.5), and fewer vaccinated participants found their symptoms unacceptable  (38.9% versus 46.4%, risk difference = -7.5%, 95% CI: -14.4% to -0.5%)    An online survey conducted by Wanga et al (2021, rated as medium quality) compared  long-term symptom changes after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination in adults with and  without a previous COVID-19 infection in the US (14). The survey was completed in April  2021 (n=100 COVID-19 cases, n=285 adults who had always received a negative COVID- 19 test result), and long-term symptoms were defined as symptoms lasting longer than 4  weeks after a positive test for COVID-19 cases, and symptoms lasting longer than 4 weeks  after they first started for adults who never had COVID-19. The analysis accounted for sex,  age, region, race and ethnicity and education. Long-term symptoms included change in  mood, change in smell or taste, chest pain or pressure, cough, diarrhoea, difficulty thinking  clearly, concentrating, forgetfulness, memory loss or “brain fog”, fatigue, tired, or weakness,  fever or chills, hair loss, headache, joint or muscle pain, nausea or vomiting, palpitations  (heart racing or pounding), post-exertional malaise (worsening of symptoms after even  minor physical, mental, or emotional exertion), problems sleeping, shortness of breath or  breathlessness, sore throat, stomach pain, or other symptoms.  •  COVID-19 cases were more likely to report that the vaccine improved their long- term symptoms than adults who never tested positive for COVID-19 (28.7%  versus 15.7%, p=0.023)  •  However COVID-19 cases were also more likely to report that their symptoms  worsened following the vaccination (although this was not statistically significant,  1116.1% versus 11.2%, p=0.27), and that their symptoms were gone before  receiving the vaccine (28.4% versus 13.1%, p=0.007)  •  Fewer COVID-19 cases reported that the vaccine did not affect their symptoms at  all (26.4% versus 59.2%)        Research in progress  Four additional studies were identified that are still in progress:  •  An NIHR funded study by Prieto-Alhambra et al will examine the effect of different  COVID-19 vaccines on long COVID in the UK (23).  •  A study by Massey et al (Project COVID Recovery: Vaccination Study) will measure the  changes in participants’ moderate to severe PASC symptoms at 6, 12 and 15 weeks  after vaccination in the US (24).  •  A study by Premkumar et al (EvaLongCovid, NCT05107271) will measure long haul  COVID-19 related symptoms in adults with chronic liver disease in India (25).  •  A randomised controlled trial by the Área de Ensayos Clínicos (EUCTR2021-003331-28- ES) will randomise adults with COVID symptoms persisting 3 weeks after the acute  phase of COVID-19 in Spain to either the Pfizer vaccine or placebo, and measure the  change in frequency and intensity of symptoms (26).       12Research Limitations  Most studies included in this report compared people with COVID-19 or long COVID who  were vaccinated with people who were not vaccinated. As there are many differences  between people who are and are not vaccinated, there is a risk in all these studies that  factors other than vaccination status may have influenced the results (in any direction),  although some studies accounted for this well (8, 11-13, 15). The selection of participants  may also have affected the results, especially for the online surveys, as people may have  chosen to take part because they had either good or poor experiences with long COVID  and vaccination, and for studies that recruited from hospitals, where participants may have  had more severe disease or comorbidities. In studies where participants report on symptom  change shortly after vaccination, the results may reflect short-term reactions to vaccination  in addition to changes in long-term symptoms.  Long COVID was defined inconsistently across studies, both in terms of the symptoms that  would comprise long COVID, but also the time frame in which the symptoms needed to be  present (long COVID, or post-COVID syndrome, in the UK is typically defined as COVID-19  symptoms beyond 12 weeks). This is particularly true of the studies were long COVID was  defined as a composite of several different symptoms. This increased the heterogeneity  between studies, though as the results were still relatively consistent, this may also be  considered a strength. The studies were also conducted at different points in the pandemic  and in different countries, and notably no studies accounted for, or reported on, the COVID- 19 variant in their analyses.  The studies where vaccination occurred before infection only included people who were  infected with COVID-19, meaning no effect of vaccination on preventing COVID-19 infection  in the first place was included in the results. As such, the total effect of vaccination on  prevention of long COVID will have been underestimated.    Review limitations  This summary was produced at pace over several days so formal data extraction was not  conducted. Most of the work was completed by one reviewer, although all narrative  summaries were checked by a second reviewer.        13Conclusion  There is evidence that vaccinated people who are subsequently infected with COVID-19  are less likely to report symptoms of long COVID than unvaccinated people, in the short  term (4 weeks after infection), medium term (12 to 20 weeks after infection) and long term  (6 months after infection). This is in addition to any benefit of vaccination in preventing  COVID-19 infection (5). There is also evidence that unvaccinated people with long COVID  who were subsequently vaccinated had, on average, reduced long COVID symptoms  (though some people reported worsened symptoms after vaccination). Additionally, there  was evidence that unvaccinated people with long COVID who were subsequently  vaccinated reported fewer long COVID symptoms than those who remained unvaccinated.  However, there is a risk of bias across all studies due to differences in people who were  vaccinated and unvaccinated, the measurement of outcomes, and in the selection of  participants.

Our rapid review approach follows streamlined systematic methodologies (27). In particular,  title and abstract screening was completed by 1 reviewer, and full text screening and  summarisation of the studies were performed by one reviewer and checked by another.  Risk of bias was assessed by 1 reviewer, using the quality criteria checklist (QCC) tool (28).   We searched a number of specialist COVID-19 review repositories and ran a broad search  using Medline, Embase, NLM COVID portfolio (for preprints), WHO COVID Database and  Google. Searches were conducted for papers published between 1 January 2020 and 12  January 2022. Search terms covered key aspects of the review question.

Full text screening and study  summaries were completed by one reviewer and checked by a second. Only results directly  relevant to the review questions were summarised.   Studies were assessed by 1 reviewer, using the QCC for primary research (28). This risk of  bias tool can be applied to most study designs (observational and interventional) and is  therefore suitable for rapid reviews of mixed type of evidence. It is composed of 10 validity  questions based on the criteria and domains identified by the Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality to assess the methodological quality of a study (that is, the extent to  which a study has minimised selection, measurement and confounding biases) (29). In the  QCC tool, 4 questions are considered critical (on selection bias, group  comparability/confounding, interventions/exposure and outcome). A study will be rated as  high quality if the answers to the 4 critical questions are ‘yes’ (and at least one additional  ‘yes’). The study will be rated as low quality if 2 or more of the critical questions are  answered ‘no’ and/or if ≥50% of the remaining questions are answered ‘no’. Otherwise, the  study will be rated as medium quality. Judgments were made on case by case for questions  answered as ‘unclear’. To note that we report these ratings as ‘quality’ ratings for  consistency with the name of the tool, although here quality needs to be understood as  ‘methodological quality’ as part of a risk of bias assessment.
