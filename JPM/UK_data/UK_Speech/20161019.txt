Average of results of four different identification schemes is shown.The individual schemes are: zero restrictions; sign restrictions;  a combination of zero and sign restrictions; sign variance decomposition restrictions. 49Some QE Programmes Work Better Than Others QE1: April 2001 – July 2008 QE2: August 2008 – February 2015 Note: As explained in the appendix of Haldane et at (2016), the impulse responses shown above are from a VAR model estimated on the series of actual JGB asset  purchases by the Bank of Japan, identified with a Choleskidecomposition. The left hand chart suggests that QE1 in Japan did not have an impact on prices, which is  roughly in line with the survey in Ugai(2007). The multipliers in the second panel suggest, once the total size of purchases is taken in account, a similar total impact as  found in Bank of Japan (2015).   50Liquidity Frictions UK Market Liquidity Measure and Regime US Market Liquidity Measure and Regime 1.2 0.20 1.2 0.25 Regime(LHS) 0.18 1.0 Regime(LHS) 0.16 1.0 0.20 GovernmentBond 0.14 MarketIlliquidity 0.8 0.8 GovernmentBond Measure(RHS) 0.12 0.15 MarketIlliquidity 0.6 0.10 0.6 Measure(RHS) 0.08 0.10 0.4 0.4 0.06 0.04 0.05 0.2 0.2 0.02 0.0 0.00 0.0 0.00 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 51State-dependence of QE Peakimpactofacentralbankbalancesheet expansionof1%ofnominalGDP Country/Regime Real GDP CPI US / High financial frictions regime 0.60 0.73 US / Low financial frictions regime 0.32 0.485 UK / High financial frictions regime 0.24 0.645 UK / Low financial frictions regime 0.14 0.48 Source: Bank calculations.
