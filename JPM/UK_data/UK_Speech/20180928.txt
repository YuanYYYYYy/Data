But it doesn’t guarantee financial stability … A financial system that can serve  households and businesses in bad  times as well as good … so we must be vigilant.And vigilant we are. To firesale risks especially. Firesale risk: The risk that non-banks are forced into selling assets quickly, driving prices down and volatility up … Sudden cash calls, for example when: Lower prices Derivative exposures  Volatile  change markets Higher  Investors redeem their  borrowing costs money at short notice Restricted  credit supply … and harming households and businessesOur approach to monitoring the risk:  Don’t wait, simulate. Not: what has gone wrong before? Instead: given how non-banks have changed, how  could they harm the economy in the future?Simulation 1: Cash calls on derivative positions.  How big might be the calls non-banks face for margin to square off derivative  positions after markets move? Do they have the cash or liquid assets to meet those calls? Or might they be forced into firesales?Simulation 1: Cash calls on derivative positions.

Safer non-banks have taken the place of dangerous shadow banks. This diversity can be a source of strength, but we have to be vigilant about firesale risks. These risks need monitoring. Not by asking whether they have appeared, but by  asking whether they could. Don’t wait. Simulate.
