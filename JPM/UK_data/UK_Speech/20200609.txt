LEADERS’ STATEMENT  THE PITTSBURGH SUMMIT  SEPTEMBER 24 – 25 2009    PREAMBLE    1.  We meet in the midst of a critical transition from crisis to recovery to turn the page on  an era of irresponsibility and to adopt a set of policies, regulations and reforms to  meet the needs of the 21st century global economy.      2.  When we last gathered in April, we confronted the greatest challenge to the world  economy in our generation.      3.  Global output was contracting at pace not seen since the 1930s.  Trade was  plummeting. Jobs were disappearing rapidly.  Our people worried that the world was  on the edge of a depression.      4.  At that time, our countries agreed to do everything necessary to ensure recovery, to  repair our financial systems and to maintain the global flow of capital.       5.  It worked.      6.  Our forceful response helped stop the dangerous, sharp decline in global activity and  stabilize financial markets.  Industrial output is now rising in nearly all our  economies.  International trade is starting to recover.  Our financial institutions are  raising needed capital, financial markets are showing a willingness to invest and lend,  and confidence has improved.      7.  Today, we reviewed the progress we have made since the London Summit in April.  Our national commitments to restore growth resulted in the largest and most  coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus ever undertaken.  We acted together to  increase dramatically the resources necessary to stop the crisis from spreading around  the world.  We took steps to fix the broken regulatory system and started to  implement sweeping reforms to reduce the risk that financial excesses will again  destabilize the global economy.      8.  A sense of normalcy should not lead to complacency.       9.  The process of recovery and repair remains incomplete.  In many countries,  unemployment remains unacceptably high.  The conditions for a recovery of private  demand are not yet fully in place.  We cannot rest until the global economy is  restored to full health, and hard-working families the world over can find decent jobs.       10. We pledge today to sustain our strong policy response until a durable recovery is  secured.  We will act to ensure that when growth returns, jobs do too.  We will avoid    1any premature withdrawal of stimulus.  At the same time, we will prepare our exit  strategies and, when the time is right, withdraw our extraordinary policy support in a  cooperative and coordinated way, maintaining our commitment to fiscal  responsibility.     11. Even as the work of recovery continues, we pledge to adopt the policies needed to lay  the foundation for strong, sustained and balanced growth in the 21st century.  We  recognize that we have to act forcefully to overcome the legacy of the recent, severe  global economic crisis and to help people cope with the consequences of this crisis.   We want growth without cycles of boom and bust and markets that foster  responsibility not recklessness.       12. Today we agreed:    13. To launch a framework that lays out the policies and the way we act together to  generate strong, sustainable and balanced global growth.  We need a durable  recovery that creates the good jobs our people need.    14.  We need to shift from public to private sources of demand, establish a pattern of  growth across countries that is more sustainable and balanced, and reduce  development imbalances. We pledge to avoid destabilizing booms and busts in  asset and credit prices and adopt macroeconomic policies, consistent with price  stability, that promote adequate and balanced global demand.  We will also make  decisive progress on structural reforms that foster private demand and strengthen  long-run growth potential.      15.  Our Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth is a compact that  commits us to work together to assess how our policies fit together, to evaluate  whether they are collectively consistent with more sustainable and balanced  growth, and to act as necessary to meet our common objectives.    16. To make sure our regulatory system for banks and other financial firms reins in the  excesses that led to the crisis.  Where reckless behavior and a lack of responsibility  led to crisis, we will not allow a return to banking as usual.     17.  We committed to act together to raise capital standards, to implement strong  international compensation standards aimed at ending practices that lead to  excessive risk-taking, to improve the over-the-counter derivatives market and to  create more powerful tools to hold large global firms to account for the risks they  take.  Standards for large global financial firms should be commensurate with the  cost of their failure.  For all these reforms, we have set for ourselves strict and  precise timetables.        18. To reform the global architecture to meet the needs of the 21st century.  After this  crisis, critical players need to be at the table and fully vested in our institutions to    2allow us to cooperate to lay the foundation for strong, sustainable and balanced  growth.       19.  We designated the G-20 to be the premier forum for our international economic  cooperation.  We established the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to include major  emerging economies and welcome its efforts to coordinate and monitor progress  in strengthening financial regulation.      20.  We are committed to a shift in International Monetary Fund (IMF) quota share to  dynamic emerging markets and developing countries of at least 5% from over- represented countries to under-represented countries using the current quota  formula as the basis to work from.  Today we have delivered on our promise to  contribute over $500 billion to a renewed and expanded IMF New Arrangements  to Borrow (NAB).      21.  We stressed the importance of adopting a dynamic formula at the World Bank  which primarily reflects countries’ evolving economic weight and the World  Bank’s development mission, and that generates an increase of at least 3% of  voting power for developing and transition countries, to the benefit of under- represented countries.  While recognizing that over-represented countries will  make a contribution, it will be important to protect the voting power of the  smallest poor countries.  We called on the World Bank to play a leading role in  responding to problems whose nature requires globally coordinated action, such  as climate change and food security, and agreed that the World Bank and the  regional development banks should have sufficient resources to address these  challenges and fulfill their mandates.    22. To take new steps to increase access to food, fuel and finance among the world’s  poorest while clamping down on illicit outflows.  Steps to reduce the development gap  can be a potent driver of global growth.       23.  Over four billion people remain undereducated, ill-equipped with capital and  technology, and insufficiently integrated into the global economy.  We need to  work together to make the policy and institutional changes needed to accelerate  the convergence of living standards and productivity in developing and emerging  economies to the levels of the advanced economies.  To start, we call on the  World Bank to develop a new trust fund to support the new Food Security  Initiative for low-income countries announced last summer.  We will increase, on  a voluntary basis, funding for programs to bring clean affordable energy to the  poorest, such as the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program.      24. To phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies  while providing targeted support for the poorest.  Inefficient fossil fuel subsidies  encourage wasteful consumption, reduce our energy security, impede investment in  clean energy sources and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change.          325.  We call on our Energy and Finance Ministers to report to us their implementation  strategies and timeline for acting to meet this critical commitment at our next  meeting.     26.  We will promote energy market transparency and market stability as part of our  broader effort to avoid excessive volatility.      27. To maintain our openness and move toward greener, more sustainable growth.       28.  We will fight protectionism.  We are committed to bringing the Doha Round to a  successful conclusion in 2010.      29.  We will spare no effort to reach agreement in Copenhagen through the United  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations.      30. We warmly welcome the report by the Chair of the London Summit commissioned at  our last meeting and published today.    31. Finally, we agreed to meet in Canada in June 2010 and in Korea in November 2010.   We expect to meet annually thereafter and will meet in France in 2011.          *      *        *   41.  We assessed the progress we have made together in addressing the global crisis and  agreed to maintain our steps to support economic activity until recovery is assured.    We further committed to additional steps to ensure strong, sustainable, and balanced  growth, to build a stronger international financial system, to reduce development  imbalances, and to modernize our architecture for international economic  cooperation.    A Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth    2.  The growth of the global economy and the success of our coordinated effort to  respond to the recent crisis have increased the case for more sustained and systematic  international cooperation.  In the short-run, we must continue to implement our  stimulus programs to support economic activity until recovery clearly has taken hold.   We also need to develop a transparent and credible process for withdrawing our  extraordinary fiscal, monetary and financial sector support, to be implemented when  recovery becomes fully secured.  We task our Finance Ministers, working with input  from the IMF and FSB, at their November meeting to continue developing  cooperative and coordinated exit strategies recognizing that the scale, timing, and  sequencing of this process will vary across countries or regions and across the type of  policy measures.  Credible exit strategies should be designed and communicated  clearly to anchor expectations and reinforce confidence.      3.  The IMF estimates that world growth will resume this year and rise by nearly 3% by  the end of 2010.  Subsequently, our objective is to return the world to high,  sustainable, and balanced growth, while maintaining our commitment to fiscal  responsibility and sustainability, with reforms to increase our growth potential and  capacity to generate jobs and policies designed to avoid both the re-creation of asset  bubbles and the re-emergence of unsustainable global financial flows.  We commit to  put in place the necessary policy measures to achieve these outcomes.    4.  We will need to work together as we manage the transition to a more balanced pattern  of global growth.  The crisis and our initial policy responses have already produced  significant shifts in the pattern and level of growth across countries.  Many countries  have already taken important steps to expand domestic demand, bolstering global  activity and reducing imbalances.  In some countries, the rise in private saving now  underway will, in time, need to be augmented by a rise in public saving.  Ensuring a  strong recovery will necessitate adjustments across different parts of the global  economy, while requiring macroeconomic policies that promote adequate and  balanced global demand as well as decisive progress on structural reforms that foster  private domestic demand, narrow the global development gap, and strengthen long- run growth potential.  The IMF estimates that only with such adjustments and  realignments, will global growth reach a strong, sustainable, and balanced pattern.   While governments have started moving in the right direction, a shared understanding  and deepened dialogue will help build a more stable, lasting, and sustainable pattern  of growth.  Raising living standards in the emerging markets and developing    5countries is also a critical element in achieving sustainable growth in the global  economy.    5.  Today we are launching a Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth.   To put in place this framework, we commit to develop a process whereby we set out  our objectives, put forward policies to achieve these objectives, and together assess  our progress.  We will ask the IMF to help us with its analysis of how our respective  national or regional policy frameworks fit together.  We will ask the World Bank to  advise us on progress in promoting development and poverty reduction as part of the  rebalancing of global growth.  We will work together to ensure that our fiscal,  monetary, trade, and structural policies are collectively consistent with more  sustainable and balanced trajectories of growth.  We will undertake macro prudential  and regulatory policies to help prevent credit and asset price cycles from becoming  forces of destabilization.  As we commit to implement a new, sustainable growth  model, we should encourage work on measurement methods so as to better take into  account the social and environmental dimensions of economic development.      6.  We call on our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors to launch the new  Framework by November by initiating a cooperative process of mutual assessment of  our policy frameworks and the implications of those frameworks for the pattern and  sustainability of global growth.  We believe that regular consultations, strengthened  cooperation on macroeconomic policies, the exchange of experiences on structural  policies, and ongoing assessment will promote the adoption of sound policies and  secure a healthy global economy.  Our compact is that:    •  G-20 members will agree on shared policy objectives.  These objectives should be  updated as conditions evolve.  •  G-20 members will set out our medium-term policy frameworks and will work  together to assess the collective implications of our national policy frameworks  for the level and pattern of global growth and to identify potential risks to  financial stability.   •  G-20 Leaders will consider, based on the results of the mutual assessment, and  agree any actions to meet our common objectives.       7.  This process will only be successful if it is supported by candid, even-handed, and  balanced analysis of our policies.  We ask the IMF to assist our Finance Ministers and  Central Bank Governors in this process of mutual assessment by developing a  forward-looking analysis of whether policies pursued by individual G-20 countries  are collectively consistent with more sustainable and balanced trajectories for the  global economy, and to report regularly to both the G-20 and the International  Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), building on the IMF’s existing bilateral  and multilateral surveillance analysis, on global economic developments, patterns of  growth and suggested policy adjustments.  Our Finance Ministers and Central Bank  Governors will elaborate this process at their November meeting and we will review  the results of the first mutual assessment at our next summit.       68.  These policies will help us to meet our responsibility to the community of nations to  build a more resilient international financial system and to reduce development  imbalances.    9.  Building on Chancellor Merkel’s proposed Charter, on which we will continue to  work, we adopted today Core Values for Sustainable Economic Activity, which will  include those of propriety, integrity, and transparency, and which will underpin the  Framework.    Strengthening the International Financial Regulatory System     10. Major failures of regulation and supervision, plus reckless and irresponsible risk  taking by banks and other financial institutions, created dangerous financial fragilities  that contributed significantly to the current crisis.  A return to the excessive risk  taking prevalent in some countries before the crisis is not an option.      11. Since the onset of the global crisis, we have developed and begun implementing  sweeping reforms to tackle the root causes of the crisis and transform the system for  global financial regulation.  Substantial progress has been made in strengthening  prudential oversight, improving risk management, strengthening transparency,  promoting market integrity, establishing supervisory colleges, and reinforcing  international cooperation.  We have enhanced and expanded the scope of regulation  and oversight, with tougher regulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives,  securitization markets, credit rating agencies, and hedge funds.  We endorse the  institutional strengthening of the FSB through its Charter, following its establishment  in London, and welcome its reports to Leaders and Ministers.  The FSB’s ongoing  efforts to monitor progress will be essential to the full and consistent implementation  of needed reforms.  We call on the FSB to report on progress to the G-20 Finance  Ministers and Central Bank Governors in advance of the next Leaders summit.      12. Yet our work is not done.  Far more needs to be done to protect consumers,  depositors, and investors against abusive market practices, promote high quality  standards, and help ensure the world does not face a crisis of the scope we have seen.   We are committed to take action at the national and international level to raise  standards together so that our national authorities implement global standards  consistently in a way that ensures a level playing field and avoids fragmentation of  markets, protectionism, and regulatory arbitrage.  Our efforts to deal with impaired  assets and to encourage the raising of additional capital must continue, where needed.   We commit to conduct robust, transparent stress tests as needed.  We call on banks to  retain a greater proportion of current profits to build capital, where needed, to support  lending. Securitization sponsors or originators should retain a part of the risk of the  underlying assets, thus encouraging them to act prudently.  It is important to ensure  an adequate balance between macroprudential and microprudential regulation to  control risks, and to develop the tools necessary to monitor and assess the buildup of  macroprudential risks in the financial system.  In addition, we have agreed to improve    7the regulation, functioning, and transparency of financial and commodity markets to  address excessive commodity price volatility.    13. As we encourage the resumption of lending to households and businesses, we must  take care not to spur a return of the practices that led to the crisis.  The steps we are  taking here, when fully implemented, will result in a fundamentally stronger financial  system than existed prior to the crisis.  If we all act together, financial institutions will  have stricter rules for risk-taking, governance that aligns compensation with long- term performance, and greater transparency in their operations.  All firms whose  failure could pose a risk to financial stability must be subject to consistent,  consolidated supervision and regulation with high standards.  Our reform is multi- faceted but at its core must be stronger capital standards, complemented by clear  incentives to mitigate excessive risk-taking practices.  Capital allows banks to  withstand those losses that inevitably will come.  It, together with more powerful  tools for governments to wind down firms that fail, helps us hold firms accountable  for the risks that they take.  Building on their Declaration on Further Steps to  Strengthen the International Financial System, we call on our Finance Ministers and  Central Bank Governors to reach agreement on an international framework of reform  in the following critical areas:    •  Building high quality capital and mitigating pro-cyclicality:  We commit to  developing by end-2010 internationally agreed rules to improve both the quantity  and quality of bank capital and to discourage excessive leverage.  These rules will  be phased in as financial conditions improve and economic recovery is assured,  with the aim of implementation by end-2012. The national implementation of  higher level and better quality capital requirements, counter-cyclical capital  buffers, higher capital requirements for risky products and off-balance sheet  activities, as elements of the Basel II Capital Framework, together with  strengthened liquidity risk requirements and forward-looking provisioning, will  reduce incentives for banks to take excessive risks and create a financial system  better prepared to withstand adverse shocks.  We welcome the key measures  recently agreed by the oversight body of the Basel Committee to strengthen the  supervision and regulation of the banking sector.  We support the introduction of  a leverage ratio as a supplementary measure to the Basel II risk-based framework  with a view to migrating to a Pillar 1 treatment based on appropriate review and  calibration.  To ensure comparability, the details of the leverage ratio will be  harmonized internationally, fully adjusting for differences in accounting.  All  major G-20 financial centers commit to have adopted the Basel II Capital  Framework by 2011.    •  Reforming compensation practices to support financial stability:  Excessive  compensation in the financial sector has both reflected and encouraged excessive  risk taking.  Reforming compensation policies and practices is an essential part of  our effort to increase financial stability.  We fully endorse the implementation  standards of the FSB aimed at  aligning compensation with long-term value  creation, not excessive risk-taking, including by (i) avoiding multi-year    8guaranteed bonuses; (ii) requiring a significant portion of variable compensation  to be deferred, tied to performance and subject to appropriate clawback and to be  vested in the form of stock or stock-like instruments, as long as these create  incentives aligned with long-term value creation and the time horizon of risk; (iii)  ensuring that compensation for senior executives and other employees having a  material impact on the firm’s risk exposure align with performance and risk; (iv)  making firms’ compensation policies and structures transparent through  disclosure requirements; (v) limiting variable compensation as a percentage of  total net revenues when it is inconsistent with the maintenance of a sound capital  base; and (vi) ensuring that compensation committees overseeing compensation  policies are able to act independently.  Supervisors should have the responsibility  to review firms’ compensation policies and structures with institutional and  systemic risk in mind and, if necessary to offset additional risks, apply corrective  measures, such as higher capital requirements, to those firms that fail to  implement sound compensation policies and practices.  Supervisors should have  the ability to modify compensation structures in the case of firms that fail or  require extraordinary public intervention.  We call on firms to implement these  sound compensation practices immediately.  We task the FSB to monitor the  implementation of FSB standards and propose additional measures as required by  March 2010.       •  Improving over-the-counter derivatives markets:  All standardized OTC  derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading  platforms, where appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties by end- 2012 at the latest.  OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade  repositories.  Non-centrally cleared contracts should be subject to higher capital  requirements.  We ask the FSB and its relevant members to assess regularly  implementation and whether it is sufficient to improve transparency in the  derivatives markets, mitigate systemic risk, and protect against market abuse.      •  Addressing cross-border resolutions and systemically important financial  institutions by end-2010:  Systemically important financial firms should develop  internationally-consistent firm-specific contingency and resolution plans.  Our  authorities should establish crisis management groups for the major cross-border  firms and a legal framework for crisis intervention as well as improve information  sharing in times of stress.  We should develop resolution tools and frameworks for  the effective resolution of financial groups to help mitigate the disruption of  financial institution failures and reduce moral hazard in the future.  Our prudential  standards for systemically important institutions should be commensurate with the  costs of their failure.  The FSB should propose by the end of October 2010  possible measures including more intensive supervision and specific additional  capital, liquidity, and other prudential requirements.    14. We call on our international accounting bodies to redouble their efforts to achieve a  single set of high quality, global accounting standards within the context of their  independent standard setting process, and complete their convergence project by June    92011.  The International Accounting Standards Board’s (IASB) institutional  framework should further enhance the involvement of various stakeholders.     15. Our commitment to fight non-cooperative jurisdictions (NCJs) has produced  impressive results.  We are committed to maintain the momentum in dealing with tax  havens, money laundering, proceeds of corruption, terrorist financing, and prudential  standards.  We welcome the expansion of the Global Forum on Transparency and  Exchange of Information, including the participation of developing countries, and  welcome the agreement to deliver an effective program of peer review.  The main  focus of the Forum’s work will be to improve tax transparency and exchange of  information so that countries can fully enforce their tax laws to protect their tax base.   We stand ready to use countermeasures against tax havens from March 2010.  We  welcome the progress made by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the fight  against money laundering and terrorist financing and call upon the FATF to issue a  public list of high risk jurisdictions by February 2010.  We call on the FSB to report  progress to address NCJs with regards to international cooperation and information  exchange in November 2009 and to initiate a peer review process by February 2010.    16. We task the IMF to prepare a report for our next meeting with regard to the range of  options countries have adopted or are considering as to how the financial sector could  make a fair and substantial contribution toward paying for any burdens associated  with government interventions to repair the banking system.    Modernizing our Global Institutions to Reflect Today’s Global Economy     17. Modernizing the international financial institutions and global development  architecture is essential to our efforts to promote global financial stability, foster  sustainable development, and lift the lives of the poorest.  We warmly welcome  Prime Minister Brown’s report on his review of the responsiveness and adaptability  of the international financial institutions (IFIs) and ask our Finance Ministers to  consider its conclusions.     Reforming the Mandate, Mission and Governance of the IMF     18. Our commitment to increase the funds available to the IMF allowed it to stem the  spread of the crisis to emerging markets and developing countries.  This commitment  and the innovative steps the IMF has taken to create the facilities needed for its  resources to be used efficiently and flexibly have reduced global risks.  Capital again  is flowing to emerging economies.     19. We have delivered on our promise to treble the resources available to the IMF.  We  are contributing over $500 billion to a renewed and expanded IMF New  Arrangements to Borrow (NAB).  The IMF has made Special Drawing Rights (SDR)  allocations of $283 billion in total, more than $100 billion of which will supplement  emerging market and developing countries’ existing reserve assets.  Resources from  the agreed sale of IMF gold, consistent with the IMF’s new income model, and funds    10from internal and other sources will more than double the Fund’s medium-term  concessional lending capacity.      20. Our collective response to the crisis has highlighted both the benefits of international  cooperation and the need for a more legitimate and effective IMF.  The Fund must  play a critical role in promoting global financial stability and rebalancing growth.  We  welcome the reform of IMF’s lending facilities, including the creation of the  innovative Flexible Credit Line.  The IMF should continue to strengthen its capacity  to help its members cope with financial volatility, reducing the economic disruption  from sudden swings in capital flows and the perceived need for excessive reserve  accumulation.  As recovery takes hold, we will work together to strengthen the  Fund’s ability to provide even-handed, candid and independent surveillance of the  risks facing the global economy and the international financial system.  We ask the  IMF to support our effort under the Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced  Growth through its surveillance of our countries’ policy frameworks and their  collective implications for financial stability and the level and pattern of global  growth.      21. Modernizing the IMF’s governance is a core element of our effort to improve the  IMF’s credibility, legitimacy, and effectiveness.  We recognize that the IMF should  remain a quota-based organization and that the distribution of quotas should reflect  the relative weights of its members in the world economy, which have changed  substantially in view of the strong growth in dynamic emerging market and  developing countries. To this end, we are committed to a shift in quota share to  dynamic emerging market and developing countries of at least five percent from over- represented to under-represented countries using the current IMF quota formula as the  basis to work from. We are also committed to protecting the voting share of the  poorest in the IMF.  On this basis and as part of the IMF’s quota review, to be  completed by January 2011, we urge an acceleration of work toward bringing the  review to a successful conclusion.  As part of that review, we agree that a number of  other critical issues will need to be addressed, including: the size of any increase in  IMF quotas, which will have a bearing on the ability to facilitate change in quota  shares; the size and composition of the Executive Board; ways of enhancing the  Board’s effectiveness; and the Fund Governors’ involvement in the strategic  oversight of the IMF.  Staff diversity should be enhanced.  As part of a  comprehensive reform package, we agree that the heads and senior leadership of all  international institutions should be appointed through an open, transparent and merit- based process.  We must urgently implement the package of IMF quota and voice  reforms agreed in April 2008.      Reforming the Mission, Mandate and Governance of Our Development banks    22. The Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) responded to our April call to  accelerate and expand lending to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the world’s  poorest with streamlined facilities, new tools and facilities, and a rapid increase in  their lending.  They are on track to deliver the promised $100 billion in additional    11lending.  We welcome and encourage the MDBs to continue making full use of their  balance sheets.  We also welcome additional measures such as the temporary use of  callable capital contributions from a select group of donors as was done at the  InterAmerican Development Bank (IaDB).  Our Finance Ministers should consider  how mechanisms such as temporary callable and contingent capital could be used in  the future to increase MDB lending at times of crisis.  We reaffirm our commitment  to ensure that the Multilateral Development Banks and their concessional lending  facilities, especially the International Development Agency (IDA) and the African  Development Fund, are appropriately funded.     23. Even as we work to mitigate the impact of the crisis, we must strengthen and reform  the global development architecture for responding to the world’s long-term  challenges.         24. We agree that development and reducing global poverty are central to the  development banks’ core mission.  The World Bank and other multilateral  development banks are also critical to our ability to act together to address challenges,  such as climate change and food security, which are global in nature and require  globally coordinated action.  The World Bank, working with the regional  development banks and other international organizations, should strengthen:    •  its focus on food security through enhancements in agricultural productivity and  access to technology, and improving access to food, in close cooperation with  relevant specialized agencies;  •  its focus on human development and security in the poorest and most challenging  environments;  •  support for private-sector led growth and infrastructure to enhance opportunities  for the poorest, social and economic inclusion, and economic growth; and  •  contributions to financing the transition to a green economy through investment in  sustainable clean energy generation and use, energy efficiency and climate  resilience; this includes responding to countries needs to integrate climate change  concerns into their core development strategies, improved domestic policies, and  to access new sources of climate finance.        25. To enhance their effectiveness, the World Bank and the regional development banks  should strengthen their coordination, when appropriate, with other bilateral and  multilateral institutions.  They should also strengthen recipient country ownership of  strategies and programs and allow adequate policy space.     26. We will help ensure the World Bank and the regional development banks have  sufficient resources to fulfill these four challenges and their development mandate,  including through a review of their general capital increase needs to be completed by  the first half of 2010.  Additional resources must be joined to key institutional  reforms to ensure effectiveness: greater coordination and a clearer division of labor;  an increased commitment to transparency, accountability, and good corporate    12governance; an increased capacity to innovate and achieve demonstrable results; and  greater attention to the needs of the poorest populations.    27. We commit to pursue governance and operational effectiveness reform in conjunction  with voting reform to ensure that the World Bank is relevant, effective, and  legitimate.  We stress the importance of moving towards equitable voting power in  the World Bank over time through the adoption of a dynamic formula which  primarily reflects countries’ evolving economic weight and the World Bank’s  development mission, and that generates in the next shareholding review a significant  increase of at least 3% of voting power for developing and transition countries, in  addition to the 1.46% increase under the first phase of this important adjustment, to  the benefit of under-represented countries.  While recognizing that over-represented  countries will make a contribution, it will be important to protect the voting power of  the smallest poor countries.  We recommit to reaching agreement by the 2010 Spring  Meetings.    Energy Security and Climate Change    28. Access to diverse, reliable, affordable and clean energy is critical for sustainable  growth.  Inefficient markets and excessive volatility negatively affect both producers  and consumers.  Noting the St. Petersburg Principles on Global Energy Security,  which recognize the shared interest of energy producing, consuming and transiting  countries in promoting global energy security, we individually and collectively  commit to:    •  Increase energy market transparency and market stability by publishing complete,  accurate, and timely data on oil production, consumption, refining and stock  levels, as appropriate, on a regular basis, ideally monthly, beginning by January  2010.  We note the Joint Oil Data Initiative as managed by the International  Energy Forum (IEF) and welcome their efforts to examine the expansion of their  data collection to natural gas.  We will improve our domestic capabilities to  collect energy data and improve energy demand and supply forecasting and ask  the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries (OPEC) to ramp up their efforts to assist interested countries  in developing those capabilities.  We will strengthen the producer-consumer  dialogue to improve our understanding of market fundamentals, including supply  and demand trends, and price volatility, and note the work of the IEF experts  group.    •  Improve regulatory oversight of energy markets by implementing the  International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recommendations  on commodity futures markets and calling on relevant regulators to collect data on  large concentrations of trader positions on oil in our national commodities futures  markets.  We ask our relevant regulators to report back at our next meeting on  progress towards implementation.  We will direct relevant regulators to also  collect related data on over-the-counter oil markets and to take steps to combat    13market manipulation leading to excessive price volatility.  We call for further  refinement and improvement of commodity market information, including  through the publication of more detailed and disaggregated data, coordinated as  far as possible internationally.  We ask IOSCO to help national governments  design and implement these policies, conduct further analysis including with  regard with to excessive volatility, make specific recommendations, and to report  regularly on our progress.    29. Enhancing our energy efficiency can play an important, positive role in promoting  energy security and fighting climate change.  Inefficient fossil fuel subsidies  encourage wasteful consumption, distort markets, impede investment in clean energy  sources and undermine efforts to deal with climate change.  The Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the IEA have found that  eliminating fossil fuel subsidies by 2020 would reduce global greenhouse gas  emissions in 2050 by ten percent.  Many countries are reducing fossil fuel subsidies  while preventing adverse impact on the poorest.  Building on these efforts and  recognizing the challenges of populations suffering from energy poverty, we commit  to:     •  Rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies  that encourage wasteful consumption.  As we do that, we recognize the  importance of providing those in need with essential energy services, including  through the use of targeted cash transfers and other appropriate mechanisms.  This  reform will not apply to our support for clean energy, renewables, and  technologies that dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  We will have  our Energy and Finance Ministers, based on their national circumstances, develop  implementation strategies and timeframes, and report back to Leaders at the next  Summit.  We ask the international financial institutions to offer support to  countries in this process.  We call on all nations to adopt policies that will phase  out such subsidies worldwide.    30. We request relevant institutions, such as the IEA, OPEC, OECD, and World Bank,  provide an analysis of the scope of energy subsidies and suggestions for the  implementation of this initiative and report back at the next summit.      31. Increasing clean and renewable energy supplies, improving energy efficiency, and  promoting conservation are critical steps to protect our environment, promote  sustainable growth and address the threat of climate change.  Accelerated adoption of  economically sound clean and renewable energy technology and energy efficiency  measures diversifies our energy supplies and strengthens our energy security.  We  commit to:     •  Stimulate investment in clean energy, renewables, and energy efficiency and  provide financial and technical support for such projects in developing countries.        14•  Take steps to facilitate the diffusion or transfer of clean energy technology  including by conducting joint research and building capacity.  The reduction or  elimination of barriers to trade and investment in this area are being discussed and  should be pursued on a voluntary basis and in appropriate fora.    32. As leaders of the world’s major economies, we are working for a resilient,  sustainable, and green recovery.  We underscore anew our resolve to take strong  action to address the threat of dangerous climate change.  We reaffirm the objective,  provisions, and principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change (UNFCCC), including common but differentiated responsibilities.  We note  the principles endorsed by Leaders at the Major Economies Forum in L’Aquila, Italy.   We will intensify our efforts, in cooperation with other parties, to reach agreement in  Copenhagen through the UNFCCC negotiation.  An agreement must include  mitigation, adaptation, technology, and financing.    33. We welcome the work of the Finance Ministers and direct them to report back at their  next meeting with a range of possible options for climate change financing to be  provided as a resource to be considered in the UNFCCC negotiations at Copenhagen.     Strengthening Support for the Most Vulnerable    34. Many emerging and developing economies have made great strides in raising living  standards as their economies converge toward the productivity levels and living  standards of advanced economies.  This process was interrupted by the crisis and is  still far from complete.  The poorest countries have little economic cushion to protect  vulnerable populations from calamity, particularly as the financial crisis followed  close on the heels of a global spike in food prices.  We note with concern the adverse  impact of the global crisis on low income countries’ (LICs) capacity to protect critical  core spending in areas such as health, education, safety nets, and infrastructure.  The  UN's new Global Impact Vulnerability Alert System will help our efforts to monitor  the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable.  We share a collective responsibility  to mitigate the social impact of the crisis and to assure that all parts of the globe  participate in the recovery.       35. The MDBs play a key role in the fight against poverty.  We recognize the need for  accelerated and additional concessional financial support to LICs to cushion the  impact of the crisis on the poorest, welcome the increase in MDB lending during the  crisis and support the MDBs having the resources needed to avoid a disruption of  concessional financing to the most vulnerable countries.  The IMF also has increased  its concessional lending to LICs during the crisis.  Resources from the sale of IMF  gold, consistent with the new income model, and funds from internal and other  sources will double the Fund’s medium-term concessional lending capacity.    36. Several countries are considering creating, on a voluntary basis, mechanisms that  could allow, consistent with their national circumstances, the mobilization of existing  SDR resources to support the IMF’s lending to the poorest countries.  Even as we    15work to mitigate the impact of the crisis, we must strengthen and reform the global  development architecture for responding to the world’s long-term challenges.  We ask  our relevant ministers to explore the benefits of a new crisis support facility in IDA to  protect LICs from future crises and the enhanced use of financial instruments in  protecting the investment plans of middle income countries from interruption in times  of crisis, including greater use of guarantees.     37. We reaffirm our historic commitment to meet the Millennium Development Goals  and our respective Official Development Assistance (ODA) pledges, including  commitments on Aid for Trade, debt relief, and those made at Gleneagles, especially  to sub-Saharan Africa, to 2010 and beyond.    38. Even before the crisis, too many still suffered from hunger and poverty and even  more people lack access to energy and finance.  Recognizing that the crisis has  exacerbated this situation, we pledge cooperation to improve access to food, fuel, and  finance for the poor.      39. Sustained funding and targeted investments are urgently needed to improve long-term  food security.  We welcome and support the food security initiative announced in  L’Aquila and efforts to further implement the Global Partnership for Agriculture and  Food Security and to address excessive price volatility.  We call on the World Bank  to work with interested donors and organizations to develop a multilateral trust fund  to scale-up agricultural assistance to low-income countries.  This will help support  innovative bilateral and multilateral efforts to improve global nutrition and build  sustainable agricultural systems, including programs like those developed through the  Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP).  It should be  designed to ensure country ownership and rapid disbursement of funds, fully  respecting the aid effectiveness principles agreed in Accra, and facilitate the  participation of private foundations, businesses, and non-governmental organizations  (NGOs) in this historic effort.  These efforts should complement the UN  Comprehensive Framework for Agriculture.  We ask the World Bank, the African  Development Bank, UN, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International  Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Food Programme (WFP) and  other stakeholders to coordinate their efforts, including through country-led  mechanisms, in order to complement and reinforce other existing multilateral and  bilateral efforts to tackle food insecurity.      40. To increase access to energy, we will promote the deployment of clean, affordable  energy resources to the developing world.  We commit, on a voluntary basis, to  funding programs that achieve this objective, such as the Scaling Up Renewable  Energy Program and the Energy for the Poor Initiative, and to increasing and more  closely harmonizing our bilateral efforts.    41. We commit to improving access to financial services for the poor.  We have agreed to  support the safe and sound spread of new modes of financial service delivery capable  of reaching the poor and, building on the example of micro finance, will scale up the    16successful models of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing.  Working  with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), the International Finance  Corporation (IFC) and other international organizations, we will launch a G-20  Financial Inclusion Experts Group.  This group will identify lessons learned on  innovative approaches to providing financial services to these groups, promote  successful regulatory and policy approaches and elaborate standards on financial  access, financial literacy, and consumer protection.  We commit to launch a G-20  SME Finance Challenge, a call to the private sector to put forward its best proposals  for how public finance can maximize the deployment of private finance on a  sustainable and scalable basis.      42. As we increase the flow of capital to developing countries, we also need to prevent its  illicit outflow.  We will work with the World Bank’s Stolen Assets Recovery (StAR)  program to secure the return of stolen assets to developing countries, and support  other efforts to stem illicit outflows.  We ask the FATF to help detect and deter the  proceeds of corruption by prioritizing work to strengthen standards on customer due  diligence, beneficial ownership and transparency.  We note the principles of the Paris  Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action and will work to  increase the transparency of international aid flows by 2010.  We call for the adoption  and enforcement of laws against transnational bribery, such as the OECD Anti- Bribery Convention, and the ratification by the G-20 of the UN Convention against  Corruption (UNCAC) and the adoption during the third Conference of the Parties in  Doha of an effective, transparent, and inclusive mechanism for the review of its  implementation.  We support voluntary participation in the Extractive Industries  Transparency Initiative, which calls for regular public disclosure of payments by  extractive industries to governments and reconciliation against recorded receipt of  those funds by governments.        Putting Quality Jobs at the Heart of the Recovery    43. The prompt, vigorous and sustained response of our countries has saved or created  millions of jobs.  Based on International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates, our  efforts will have created or saved at least 7 – 11 million jobs by the end of this year.   Without sustained action, unemployment is likely to continue rising in many of our  countries even after economies stabilize, with a disproportionate impact on the most  vulnerable segments of our population.  As growth returns, every country must act to  ensure that employment recovers quickly.  We commit to implementing recovery  plans that support decent work, help preserve employment, and prioritize job growth.   In addition, we will continue to provide income, social protection, and training  support for the unemployed and those most at risk of unemployment.  We agree that  the current challenges do not provide an excuse to disregard or weaken internationally  recognized labor standards.  To assure that global growth is broadly beneficial, we  should implement policies consistent with ILO fundamental principles and rights at  work.      1744. Our new Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth requires structural  reforms to create more inclusive labor markets, active labor market policies, and  quality education and training programs.  Each of our countries will need, through its  own national policies, to strengthen the ability of our workers to adapt to changing  market demands and to benefit from innovation and investments in new technologies,  clean energy, environment, health, and infrastructure.  It is no longer sufficient to  train workers to meet their specific current needs; we should ensure access to training  programs that support lifelong skills development and focus on future market needs.   Developed countries should support developing countries to build and strengthen  their capacities in this area.  These steps will help to assure that the gains from new  inventions and lifting existing impediments to growth are broadly shared.       45. We pledge to support robust training efforts in our growth strategies and investments.   We recognize successful employment and training programs are often designed  together with employers and workers, and we call on the ILO, in partnership with  other organizations, to convene its constituents and NGOs to develop a training  strategy for our consideration.     46. We agree on the importance of building an employment-oriented framework for  future economic growth.  In this context, we reaffirm the importance of the London  Jobs Conference and Rome Social Summit.  We also welcome the recently-adopted  ILO Resolution on Recovering from the Crisis: A Global Jobs Pact, and we commit  our nations to adopt key elements of its general framework to advance the social  dimension of globalization.  The international institutions should consider ILO  standards and the goals of the Jobs Pact in their crisis and post-crisis analysis and  policy-making activities.       47. To ensure our continued focus on employment policies, the Chair of the Pittsburgh  Summit has asked his Secretary of Labor to invite our Employment and Labor  Ministers to meet as a group in early 2010 consulting with labor and business and  building on the upcoming OECD Labour and Employment Ministerial meeting on the  jobs crisis.  We direct our Ministers to assess the evolving employment situation,  review reports from the ILO and other organizations on the impact of policies we  have adopted, report on whether further measures are desirable, and consider  medium-term employment and skills development policies, social protection  programs, and best practices to ensure workers are prepared to take advantage of  advances in science and technology.     An Open Global Economy    48. Continuing the revival in world trade and investment is essential to restoring global  growth.  It is imperative we stand together to fight against protectionism.  We  welcome the swift implementation of the $250 billion trade finance initiative.  We  will keep markets open and free and reaffirm the commitments made in Washington  and London:  to refrain from raising barriers or imposing new barriers to investment  or to trade in goods and services, imposing new export restrictions or implementing    18World Trade Organization (WTO) inconsistent measures to stimulate exports and  commit to rectify such measures as they arise.  We will minimize any negative impact  on trade and investment of our domestic policy actions, including fiscal policy and  action to support the financial sector.  We will not retreat into financial protectionism,  particularly measures that constrain worldwide capital flows, especially to developing  countries.  We will notify promptly the WTO of any relevant trade measures.  We  welcome the latest joint report from the WTO, OECD, IMF, and United Nations  Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and ask them to continue to  monitor the situation within their respective mandates, reporting publicly on these  commitments on a quarterly basis.    49. We remain committed to further trade liberalization.  We are determined to seek an  ambitious and balanced conclusion to the Doha Development Round in 2010,  consistent with its mandate, based on the progress already made, including with  regard to modalities. We understand the need for countries to directly engage with  each other, within the WTO bearing in mind the centrality of the multilateral process,  in order to evaluate and close the remaining gaps.  We note that in order to conclude  the negotiations in 2010, closing those gaps should proceed as quickly as possible.   We ask our ministers to take stock of the situation no later than early 2010, taking  into account the results of the work program agreed to in Geneva following the Delhi  Ministerial, and seek progress on Agriculture, Non-Agricultural Market Access, as  well as Services, Rules, Trade Facilitation and all other remaining issues.  We will  remain engaged and review the progress of the negotiations at our next meeting.    The Path from Pittsburgh    50. Today, we designated the G-20 as the premier forum for our international economic  cooperation. We have asked our representatives to report back at the next meeting  with recommendations on how to maximize the effectiveness of our cooperation.  We  agreed to have a G-20 Summit in Canada in June 2010, and in Korea in November  2010.  We expect to meet annually thereafter, and will meet in France in 2011.    19ANNEX:  Core Values for Sustainable Economic Activity    1.  The economic crisis demonstrates the importance of ushering in a new era of  sustainable global economic activity grounded in responsibility.  The current crisis  has once again confirmed the fundamental recognition that our growth and prosperity  are interconnected, and that no region of the globe can wall itself off in a globalized  world economy.      2.  We, the Leaders of the countries gathered for the Pittsburgh Summit, recognize that  concerted action is needed to help our economies get back to stable ground and  prosper tomorrow.  We commit to taking responsible actions to ensure that every  stakeholder – consumers, workers, investors, entrepreneurs – can participate in a  balanced, equitable, and inclusive global economy.      3.  We share the overarching goal to promote a broader prosperity for our people through  balanced growth within and across nations; through coherent economic, social, and  environmental strategies; and through robust financial systems and effective  international collaboration.        4.  We recognize that there are different approaches to economic development and  prosperity, and that strategies to achieve these goals may vary according to countries’  circumstances.      5.  We also agree that certain key principles are fundamental, and in this spirit we  commit to respect the following core values:    •  We have a responsibility to ensure sound macroeconomic policies that serve long- term economic objectives and help avoid unsustainable global imbalances.     •  We have a responsibility to reject protectionism in all its forms, support open  markets, foster fair and transparent competition, and promote entrepreneurship  and innovation across countries.     •  We have a responsibility to ensure, through appropriate rules and incentives, that  financial and other markets function based on propriety, integrity and  transparency and to encourage businesses to support the efficient allocation of  resources for sustainable economic performance.    •  We have a responsibility to provide for financial markets that serve the needs of  households, businesses and productive investment by strengthening oversight,  transparency, and accountability.    •  We have a responsibility to secure our future through sustainable consumption,  production and use of resources that conserve our environment and address the  challenge of climate change.      20•  We have a responsibility to invest in people by providing education, job training,  decent work conditions, health care and social safety net support, and to fight  poverty, discrimination, and all forms of social exclusion.     •  We have a responsibility to recognize that all economies, rich and poor, are  partners in building a sustainable and balanced global economy in which the  benefits of economic growth are broadly and equitably shared.  We also have a  responsibility to achieve the internationally agreed development goals.     •  We have a responsibility to ensure an international economic and financial  architecture that reflects changes in the world economy and the new challenges of  globalization.      21G-20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth    1.  Our countries have a shared responsibility to adopt policies to achieve strong,  sustainable and balanced growth, to promote a resilient international financial system,  and to reap the benefits of an open global economy.  To this end, we recognize that  our strategies will vary across countries.  In our Framework for Strong, Sustainable  and Balanced Growth, we will:     •  implement responsible fiscal policies, attentive to short-term flexibility  considerations and longer-run sustainability requirements.  •  strengthen financial supervision to prevent the re-emergence in the financial  system of excess credit growth and excess leverage and undertake macro  prudential and regulatory policies to help prevent credit and asset price cycles  from becoming forces of destabilization.    •  promote more balanced current accounts and support open trade and investment  to advance global prosperity and growth sustainability, while actively rejecting  protectionist measures.   •  undertake monetary policies consistent with price stability in the context of  market oriented exchange rates that reflect underlying economic fundamentals.  •  undertake structural reforms to increase our potential growth rates and, where  needed, improve social safety nets.   •  promote balanced and sustainable economic development in order to narrow   development imbalances and reduce poverty.    2.  We recognize that the process to ensure more balanced global growth must be  undertaken in an orderly manner.  All G-20 members agree to address the respective  weaknesses of their economies.    •  G-20 members with sustained, significant external deficits pledge to undertake  policies to support private savings and undertake fiscal consolidation while  maintaining open markets and strengthening export sectors.  •  G-20 members with sustained, significant external surpluses pledge to strengthen  domestic sources of growth.  According to national circumstances this could  include increasing investment, reducing financial markets distortions, boosting  productivity in service sectors, improving social safety nets, and lifting constraints  on demand growth.    3.  Each G-20 member bears primary responsibility for the sound management of its  economy.  The G-20 members also have a responsibility to the community of nations  to assure the overall health of the global economy.  Regular consultations,  strengthened cooperation on macroeconomic policies, the exchange of experiences on  structural policies, and ongoing assessment can strengthen our cooperation and  promote the adoption of sound policies.  As part of our process of mutual assessment:    •  G-20 members will agree on shared policy objectives.  These objectives should be  updated as conditions evolve.    22•  G-20 members will set out their medium-term policy frameworks and will work  together to assess the collective implications of our national policy frameworks  for the level and pattern of global growth, and to identify potential risks to  financial stability.   •  G-20 leaders will consider, based on the results of the mutual assessment, and  agree any actions to meet our common objectives.      4.  We call on our Finance Ministers to develop our process of mutual assessment to  evaluate the collective implications of national policies for the world economy. To  accomplish this, our Finance Ministers should, with the assistance of the IMF:    •  Develop a forward looking assessment of G-20 economic developments to help  analyze whether patterns of demand and supply, credit, debt and reserves growth  are supportive of strong, sustainable and balanced growth.  •  Assess the implications and consistency of fiscal and monetary policies, credit  growth and asset markets, foreign exchange developments, commodity and  energy prices, and current account imbalances.  •  Report regularly to both the G-20 and the IMFC on global economic  developments, key risks, and concerns with respect to patterns of growth and  suggested G-20 policy adjustments, individually and collectively.      23
