Self-employment as a proportion of total  employment is high by international standards in the United Kingdom, but the  share has fluctuated over time.  We examine the time series movements in  self-employment, which are principally driven by financial liberalisation and  changes in taxation rules, especially as they relate to the construction sector  which is the dominant sector.  We document that the median earnings of the  self-employed is less than for employees.  We show that in comparison with  employees the self-employed are more likely to be male; immigrants; work in  construction or financial activities; hold an apprenticeship; work in London;  work  long  hours;  have  high  levels  of  job  satisfaction  and  happiness.   Consistent with the existence of capital constraints on potential and actual  entrepreneurs, the estimates imply that the probability of self-employment  depends positively upon whether the individual ever received an inheritance  or gift.  Evidence is also found that rising house prices have increased the self- employment rate.  There appears to be no evidence that changes in self- employment are correlated with changes in real GDP, nor national happiness.This  paper  examines  the  causes  and  consequences  of  changes  in  the  incidence  of  entrepreneurship in the United Kingdom.  But an initial question must be:  how many entrepreneurs  are there?  The answer is not straightforward.  There are several ways of counting them. The  simplest is to count the number of self-employed workers, but even that is difficult.  We could  count those that self report their employment status, such as in the Labour Force Survey (LFS).1   Or we could count the number of individuals who declare self-employment income for taxation  purposes.  It would be useful to do both and see if the numbers equate.  They do not.  In fact, the  number of people who declare taxable income from self-employment in the United Kingdom is  roughly 50% greater than the number that say they are self-employed. Her Majesty’s Revenue and  Customs (HMRC) records just over 4.5 million individuals declaring some income from self- employment in 2003/4, but the LFS records just over 3 million self-employed workers.  This is not  that surprising.      It is clear that many individuals have more than one job, so the number of individuals  reporting self-employed earnings for taxation purposes should be expected to be higher than the  number that say they are self-employed.  It is also likely that in some instances individuals will  struggle to identify whether they are principally an employee or self-employed. They could base  their  decision  on hours  worked or  income  earned.    Or it  could  reflect  the  timing of  survey  responses.  A classic example is that of a free-lancing actor.  Fifty-one weeks of the year they work  for a wage waiting tables in a restaurant.  But by the survey reference week they have quit their job                                                    1 The definition of self-employment in the Labour Force Survey is left entirely to the respondent, and with no guidance  or prompt. This could result in a lack of coherence with other measures of the self-employed, such as the Inland  Revenue’s Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) or with measures of jobs based largely on employer surveys, such as  workforce jobs. There is currently a consistency check to the LFS, carried out by the ONS, which recodes some  respondents’ employment status to employee if the occupation they claim to do is inconsistent with self-employment  (for example, self-employed policeman).as a waiter and they star in a film for which they are paid one hundred times the wages they earned  as a waiter over the previous fifty one weeks.  Are they self-employed or employed?      In this paper we focus primarily on the characteristics of the self-employed and how self- employment  has  changed  over  time,  principally  in  the  United  Kingdom,  using  the  LFS.   Unfortunately these data do not record self-employed earnings.  Consequently, we also make use of  the  HMRC  data  as  well  as  information  from  various  Family  Resources  Surveys  to  compare  earnings of the self-employed with the wages and salaries earned by employees.    The most entrepreneurial individuals in the UK, such  as Lakshmi Mittal,  Sir Richard  Branson and Sir Alan Sugar, are generally not included in our surveys.  A very small number of the  most entrepreneurial individuals are very important both in terms of wealth and job creation.  What  distinguishes them from everyone else?  As far as we can, with the limited data available, we  examine their characteristics too.   In what follows we first consider time series trends in self-employment in the UK and  elsewhere.  Second, we compare the earnings of the self-employed with those of wage and salary  workers.  Third, we examine the characteristics of the self-employed.  Fourth we perform a series  of econometric analyses of the determinants of self-employment and draw comparisons with the  United States and the EU.  Fifth we consider the importance of liquidity constraints and the role of  inheritances and gifts and rising house prices in overcoming these credit constraints.  Sixth, we  examine macro-economic consequences and correlates of self-employment and draw a series of  conclusions.  The aim of this paper is thus to identify the characteristics of the self-employed and  try to explain how and why their numbers have changed over time.        21.  Time series trends    Self-employment as a proportion of total UK employment is especially high in comparison  with other OECD countries (Blanchflower, 2000, 2005).2   Table 1 reports data on the change in the  proportion of all workers who were self-employed in the decades since the 1960s for the OECD  countries  (Australia,  Austria,  Belgium,  Canada,  Czech  Republic,  Denmark,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Hungary,  Iceland,  Ireland,  Italy,  Japan,  Korea,  Luxembourg,  Mexico,  the  Netherlands,  New  Zealand,  Norway,  Poland,  Portugal,  Slovakia,  Spain,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Turkey, UK, USA).  Data are taken from the OECD Labour Force Statistics.  In the 1960s, the  highest proportions were found in Italy (36.4%), Korea (35.0%), Poland (34.5%), Ireland (30.1%)  and Austria (28.3%).  The proportion of self-employed workers has subsequently fallen sharply in  all these countries, and most others.  The only countries to have recorded increases in their self- employment rates between the 1960s and 2000s (for which data are available) have been the United  Kingdom and New Zealand.3  The increase in the United Kingdom was +5.2pp while the increase  in New Zealand was 4.7pp.    A  similar  result  holds  in  Table  2  for  non-agricultural  self-employment  in  these  two  countries.  However, there are now several additional countries for which the trend has been  upwards over the past 4 decades (or 3 where data for the 1960s is not available): Australia, Canada,  Finland,  Germany,  Iceland,  Ireland,  Mexico,  the  Netherlands,  Poland,  Portugal,  and  Sweden.   Within these other countries it would appear that declines in agricultural self-employment have  shrouded  an  upward  trend  in  self-employment  across  other  sectors.    Moreover,  the  self- employment rate falls by less (or increases in the case of those countries previously mentioned)                                                    2 Alternatively, the total workforce can be used as the denominator, as in Weir (2003) or Taylor (2004).  Movements in  the two series appear very similar over time.      3 The Norwegian rate did increase by 0.7pp, but has actually been falling since the 1970s.    3across 24 of the 25 countries for which data are available when only those employed in non- agricultural activities are considered; the exception being Mexico.  The difference is most apparent  in Poland, where the average non-agricultural self-employment rate was +9.0pp higher in the 2000s  than the average of the 1960s, compared with a -12.6pp fall when all workers are considered.  The  change in the UK self-employment rate excluding agricultural workers is little different from that  including those workers.  But the change in the New Zealand rate is nearly twice as large (+7.7pp  versus +4.7pp) when only those employed in non-agricultural activities are considered.    Table 3 sets out a time series of self-employment rates for the United Kingdom, based on  data published in various issues of the Employment Gazette between 1962 and 1991 (collected by  the Department of Employment and Productivity (1962-1970); and the Department of Employment  (1971-1991)), and subsequently data from the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS).  In 2006, out of  28,959,000 workers, 3,753,000 or 13.0% of the labour force were classified as self-employed.  This  figure has increased markedly in recent years, up from 11.9% in 2001.  Between 2001 and 2006,  the number of employees increased by 3.5%, while the number of self-employed workers increased  by 13.7%.  The self-employment rate has been higher than this, however.   The rate peaked at just  over 14% in 1991, and remained around 13.5% during much of the early 1990s, before gradually  declining from 1997.  But prior to the 1990s, the rate had been much lower.  Using OECD data, the  average self-employment rate in the United Kingdom during the 1960s was 7.1%; the 1970s, 8.0%;  the 1980s, 10.8%; the 1990s, 13.3%; and the 2000s, 12.3%.  These averages clearly indicate that  the period of most rapid growth in UK self-employment was during the 1980s.  As a validation of  the changes in self-employment it is appropriate to look at VAT registrations published by the  Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).4  VAT registrations and deregistrations, according to the                                                    4 The VAT data were also examined by Black, De Meza and Jeffreys (1996),    4DTI, are “the best official guide to the pattern of business start-ups and closures”.5  The VAT  figures do not, however, give the complete picture of start-up and closure activity in the economy.  Some VAT exempt sectors and businesses operating below the threshold for VAT registration are  not covered.  At the start of 2005, the VAT threshold was an annual turnover of £58,000, and only  1.8 million of the estimated 4.3 million enterprises in the UK were VAT-registered.   However,  some businesses do voluntarily register for VAT even though their turnover is below the threshold.   Data for 2005 shows that around a fifth of all registrations had turnover below the VAT threshold.   In 2005  there  were  177,900 registrations  and  152,900  de-registrations, resulting in  an  increase of 25,000 (1.4%) in the stock of VAT registered enterprises.  As can be seen below there  have been increases in the stock of VAT registrations in every year from 1995.

However, the two series move in opposite directions between  1995 and 2002.  The decline in the self-employment rate is primarily related to changes in the rules  of the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS), which is the Inland Revenue’s taxation system for the  construction industry.  Freedman (2001) noted that between 1995 and 1997, 200,000 construction  workers reclassified themselves as employees as a result of changes to the CIS.  We discuss the  impact of changes in the CIS in more detail below.  It is also apparent that there have been significant changes in the size distribution of firms  registered for VAT.  The table below shows that the number of firms increased by nearly 620,000  between 2000 and 2005, of which just over 570,000 (92.1%) were firms with no employees.        2005           2000  All enterprises  4,342,045  3,722,610       With no employees  3,162,600  2,591,775 All employers  1,179,445  1,130,835    1-4    778,700  738,685    5-9    207,225  206,090    10-19    106,020  108,075    20-49    54,955  46,155    50-99    17,160  15,700    100-199    7,835  7,820    200-249    1,575  1,565    250-499    3,030  3,260    500 or more  2,940  3,485   Source: DTI  http://www.dtistats.net/smes/sme/                                                         6 Note that increases in the VAT registration threshold in 1991 and 1993 mean the estimates are only broadly  comparable over the period 1980-2005.    6Table 4 reports survival rates of VAT registered enterprises for up to 10 years for the UK  from 1995-2005.  The probability of a firm surviving 10 years is approximately one third.  Over  time the probability of survival has increased.  The late 1980s account for most of the increase in the number of entrepreneurs in the UK  economy  –  whether  we  define  entrepreneurship  using  self-employment  numbers  or  VAT  registrations.  The number of self-employed workers rose by more than two hundred and thirty  thousand in each of the years 1986-1987, 1988-1989 and 1989-1990, while the 1987-1988 increase  was a still healthy, one hundred and fifty thousand.  So between 1986 and 1990 the number of self- employed grew by over eight hundred and fifty thousand, from 2.91 million to 3.76 million, while  the rate grew from 11.8% to 14.0%.  It is apparent that 1984 was also an important year for growth,  with the largest (+266k) annual increase on record.  Sharp falls in both self-employment and VAT registrations followed in the early 1990s,  contemporaneous with the UK recession.  The number of self-employed workers fell by -91k in  1991-1992, -208k in 1992-1993 and -58k in 1993-1994.  It is notable, however, that the self- employment rate did not start to fall until 1992, while the unemployment rate started to rise in late  1990.  This indicates that employees felt the effects of the downturn in demand earlier than the self- employed.  The self-employment rate then stabilised for a period, before falling again.    The number of self-employed workers declined in all but two years between 1990 and  2000.  This decline was dramatically reversed in 2003, when the number of self-employed workers  rose by +229k.  A further 100k individuals became self-employed in 2006, causing the self- employment rate to rise to 13.0%.  VAT registrations also fell between 1997 and 2001 and then  increased subsequently.    7The big increases in self-employment in the late-1980s occurred as unemployment was  declining sharply, while the falls of the early 1990s occurred as the labour market loosened.  In  contrast, the 2001-2004 increase of more than three hundred thousand, alongside a jump of nearly  one percentage point in the rate (11.9% in 2001 to 12.8% in 2004), seems rather large given that  the unemployment rate declined by only 0.4pp, from 5.2% to 4.8%, over this period.  So how is  self-employment related to the economic cycle?  It is well established that the employment rate tends to move pro-cyclically, while the  unemployment rate typically moves in the opposite direction.  This inverse relationship is very  simple to explain.  Every individual in the population (Pop) can be categorised into three groups:  employed (E), unemployed (U) or inactive (I).  We can therefore write:  (1)  E + U + I = Pop         By dividing through by population and substituting the standard definitions for the employment  rate (e=E/Pop), unemployment rate (u= U/(U+E)) and the activity rate (a=(U+E)/Pop) into equation  (1), we can state:  (2)  e = a (1-u)    This says that the employment rate should be negatively correlated with the unemployment rate  given stable activity; which it is.   Self-employment is a significant component of total employment, so one might imagine  that movements in the self-employment rate should also be closely (inversely) correlated with  movements in the unemployment rate.  But such a relationship is not clear in the United Kingdom.    Chart 2 shows that while there was a strong negative correlation between 1984 and 1994 (-0.75),  the correlation over the 35 years since 1971 has been positive (+0.41).  Furthermore, Chart 3 shows  that the self-employment rate and total employment rate are actually negatively correlated over the  8same period.  In other words, the self-employment rate is not well correlated with the economic  cycle and the inverse relationship between employment and unemployment between 1971 and  1984, and since 1994, is driven entirely by forms of employment other than self-employment.  Why  might this occur?  There are two distinct types of self-employed workers: those that choose (‘pulled’) to  become  self-employed  because  of  economic  prosperity;  and  those  that  are  pushed  into  self- employment because of economic adversity.  Chart 4 captures the rate of transition of workers  ‘pulled’ into self-employment over the economic cycle using micro-data from the Labour Force  Survey.  The transition rate clearly rises in periods of economic expansion.  For example, 8.2% of  self-employed workers in 2006 had been employees in 2005.  This translates into a flow of 308,000  workers.  This may seem high, but one has to remember that a significant proportion of new  businesses fail within a year, so there will be a flow out of self-employment too.  Table 4 shows  that 7.9% of new VAT registered businesses started in 2002 had failed in the first 12 months of  trading according to the DTI, and around 30% had failed within the first 3 years. This means that  the flow into self-employment must be high in order for the self-employment rate to even remain  stable.    In contrast, Chart 5 shows that the rate of transition of unemployed workers into self- employment falls during periods of economic expansion.  For example, just 1.4% of self-employed  workers in 2006 had been unemployed in 2005, but the proportion was 3.1% in 1993, when the  unemployment rate was at its previous peak.   Chart 6 shows the transition from out of the labour  force (OLF), which is uncorrelated with the unemployment rate over the long run.    The self-employment rate is clearly a function of both ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors, which are  related in opposite ways to measures of the economic cycle.  It would therefore appear that the two  9effects cancel each other out to a degree over long periods and cause the self-employment rate to be  uncorrelated with the economic cycle.  However, it is also the case that other factors are more  likely to dominate the decision to become self-employed.  During the 1980s and early 1990s, self- employment was stimulated in the United Kingdom through changes in: industrial composition,  stemming from shifts in relative demand; technological advancements; government policy; and  financial markets. We now look at these in turn.      a) Industrial composition   Probably  most  importantly,  the  industrial  composition  of  the  UK  economy  started  to  change.  The contribution from service sector industries to total GVA rose from 57% in 1985, to  66% in 1995 (Chart 7).  In contrast, the contribution from manufacturing firms fell by 4pp over the  same period, to 22%.  Robson (1998) finds that self-employment rates across UK regions are  highest in those regions in which ‘a relatively high proportion of GDP is accounted for by certain  industries  in  which  the  [financial]  barriers  to  self-employment  tend  to  be  relatively  low.’  Consequently, the transition to a predominantly service orientated economy appears to have opened  up new opportunities for entrepreneurs.    b) Financial deregulation  The financial hurdles were further eroded by the liberalisation of banking rules in the 1980s  and the subsequent appreciation of house prices (Chart 8).  Robson (1998) argues that the major  source of loan collateral for start-ups in the United Kingdom is the equity provided by owner  occupied housing.  Thus, rising house prices enable liquidity constrained, nascent entrepreneurs to  start a business.  The annual, nominal7 rate of house price inflation was positive throughout the  1980s, averaging 12.3%, according to the Nationwide index.  Indeed, the average UK house price                                                    7 The real rate of annual house price inflation was positive from 1983 onwards.      10rose 170% between 1980 and 1989.  And the home-ownership rate, propelled by the sale of council  houses following the 1980 Housing Act and introduction of the Right-to-Buy scheme, rose from  57.6% in 1981 to 65.2% in 1989.8  Black et al. (1996), for example, found that a 10% rise in the  value of unreleased net housing equity increases the number of new firm VAT registrations by  some 5%.  Cowling and Mitchell (1997) estimate that a 10% rise in housing wealth increases the  proportion of the workforce in self-employment by 3%.  Over the 1980s, the number of self- employed workers rose by 1,327,000, or 60.2%.    c) Government policies  Financial liberalisation supported the growth in self-employment, but other government  policies  were  introduced  during  the  1980s  that  were  specifically  aimed  at  encouraging  more  workers to become self-employed.  Local Enterprise Agencies (LEAs), for example, were created  in 1978, to encourage the formation and growth of small firms by providing grants, advice and  training to unemployed workers.  The agencies originated as a partnership response from business  and  local  councils  to  high  levels  of  unemployment  and  the  demise  of  large  sections  of  manufacturing, particularly in the industrial Midlands and the North, but their work continues  today across the United Kingdom.  These were followed in 1981 by the Loan Guarantee Scheme  (LGS), through which the government acts as the guarantor on private sector loans to small and  ‘young’ businesses.  Loans are made to firms or individuals unable to obtain conventional finance  because  of  a  lack  of  track  record  or  security.  The  guarantee  generally  covers  70%  of  the  outstanding loan. This rises to 85% for established businesses trading for two years or more. Loans   can be for amounts between £5,000 and £100,000 (£250,000 for established businesses) and over a  period of two to ten years.  Data are not available prior to 1995, but in the decade since, 46,531                                                    8 Depart for Communities and Local Government, housing Live Table 101.  http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1156006     11loans were granted worth about £2 billion.  Of these, about a third went to start-ups.  Table 5 shows  that of the period total, around a third of firms (14,700) defaulted on their loan.    The Enterprise Allowance Scheme (EAS) ran from 1983 to 1991, paying self-employed  workers a supplementary weekly income (of around £40 a week) for up to 12 months.  In theory,  this scheme compensated workers for a loss of unemployment benefit.  Only the very short-term  unemployed, those unemployed for less than 13 weeks (although this was later reduced), were  excluded  from  the  programme.    There  were  criticisms  that  the  EAS  potentially  created  displacement  (occurring  when  subsidised  businesses  took  output  and  employment  from  non- subsidised firms) and ‘deadweight loss’ effects (arising when a subsidy was paid to a firm that  would have been set up anyway in the absence of the scheme).  Nevertheless, Campbell and Daly  (1992) estimate that following implementation, one in eight of those that became self-employed  during the late 1980s were supported into employment through this scheme.  It is apparent from  Table 3 that in the twelve months following the scheme’s introduction self-employment rose by  266k, the largest recorded annual increase of the past 40 years.    d) Tax system  The decision to become, and remain, self-employed can also be affected by the tax system.   The methods for computing tax between employees and self-employed workers vary significantly  in the United Kingdom (see Freedman (2001) for a comprehensive discussion).  Freedman (2001)  argues that attempts to evade the payment of tax in the construction sector influenced movements  in  self-employment  numbers  over  the  late  1980s  and  1990s.  Under  the  original  rules  of  the  Construction  Industry  Scheme  (CIS),  which  is  the  Inland  Revenue’s  taxation  system  for  the  construction industry, employers had an incentive to treat employees as self-employed workers in  order to avoid paying National Insurance Contributions, nor provide benefits, training or observe  12employment  protection  laws.    The  Inland  Revenue  took  steps  to  revise  the  CIS  in  1995  by  introducing mandatory registration cards for all subcontractors.  Without the card, a subcontractor  is treated as an employee.  With the card, the subcontractor is paid under deduction of tax and  treated as self-employed.  Freedman records that 700,000 construction industry workers were  treated as self-employed in 1986. But between 1995 and 1997, 200,000 construction workers  reclassified  themselves  as  employees,  which  can  more  than  explain  the  reduction  in  self- employment over the period (-100k).  Table 6 records a 12pp fall in the construction sector self- employment rate between 1995 and 2000 using LFS data, while most other sectors (the exception  being agriculture) recorded more modest declines, or small increases.  The years 2000-2005 show  an increase in the self-employment share of construction workers.  Table 7 shows the changes in  the industry distribution of the self-employed.  The declining importance of construction in terms  of its share from 1995-2000 is striking, as is its increased importance subsequently, alongside  increases in Real Estate, Renting and Business Activities.    Changes in the tax system can also have large, and sometimes unexpected, ramifications for  the numbers of workers who choose to become self-employed.  For instance, the UK government  abolished corporation tax on the first £10,000 of company profits in April 2002, and also allowed  directors of small companies to save income tax by taking their salaries as profits.  This may have  stimulated some already self-employed workers to incorporate in order to avoid paying income tax  and national insurance contributions.  But the changes probably also contributed to an increase in  the  number  of  employees  who  became  self-employed;  the  number  of  self-employed  workers  increased by 10.1% between 2002Q1 and 2003Q4, according to the LFS.  This increase is reflected  in a rise in the proportion of self-employed workers who had been employees a year earlier.  Table  8 shows that the flows from employment into self-employment, while volatile, peaked in 2002- 132003.   The  largest  increase  in self-employment  (around half) during  2002-2003  came  in  the  Banking, Finance and Insurance sectors and was dominated by the 35-49 age group, although there  were also large increases in the 50-64/59 and 65/60 and over age groups.  The rise seems consistent  with media stories about City job losses leading to people moving into self-employment (Lindsay  and Macaulay (2004)).  In any case, the government re-considered its position following the  increase in incorporations and decided to tax distributed profits at 19% in 2004, thus reducing the  incentives for workers to turn to self-employment.  Following this tax change, the flows from  employment into self-employment declined.  e) Price of investment goods  An additional exogenous stimulus to self-employment growth over the past few decades has  been a steady decline in the price of investment goods, particularly information, communication  and technology (ICT) products, relative to other goods (Chart 9).  Such a decline can be explained  by an increase in technological progress in the development of these goods in comparison with  other sectors (Bakhshi & Thompson (2002)).   These price falls will have increased the relative  rates of return from self-employment, making independence more attractive (Blau, 1987 and Acs et  al., 1994).  Over the past couple of years there has been a substantial growth in the numbers of self  employed as well as in the self-employment rate  The data below are taken from Table 3 of Labour  Market Statistics First Release, ONS April 2007.  Total employment also includes small numbers  of unpaid family workers and those on Government schemes.  The numbers of self-employed over  the period Dec-Feb 2005-2007 increased by 187,000, representing 64.0% of the total growth of  employment of 292,000 over the period.9  Moreover, only 37.6% of the additional employee jobs                                                    9 In the table below ‘others’ includes unpaid family workers and those on Government supported training &  employment programmes.  14were full-time compared with 61.8% of self-employed jobs.  In addition, over the most recent  quarter, December 2006 – February 2007, the number of employees fell by 68,000 while the  number of self-employed grew by 30,000.

At the same time there have been increases in the age of the self-employed and a decline in the                                                                                                                                                                      10 The distribution of the self-employed by region of residence is as follows                                                                                                 2001-2003                        2004-2006  Tyne & Wear             1.02   1.02  Rest of Northern region   2.40    2.68  South Yorkshire   1.54    1.56  West Yorkshire   2.81    2.90  Rest of Yorks & Humberside   2.63    2.76  East Midlands   6.71    6.91  East Anglia   4.15    3.89  Inner London   6.03  5.93  Outer London   8.58  9.16  Rest of South East   22.64  22.52  South West   10.32  9.71  West Midlands (met county)   3.03   3.20  Rest of West Midlands   4.51   4.73  Greater Manchester   3.43   3.53  Merseyside   1.44   1.46  Rest of North West   3.91   3.72  Wales   4.79   4.47  Strathclyde   2.51   2.40  Rest of Scotland   4.49   4.22  Northern Ireland   3.07   3.24    15hours worked over this period.  Chart 10 shows changes in the transition rates into and out of self- employment since 1995 for those of working age using matched data from the LFS.  Data are only  available from the ONS to do this matching for those of working age.  There is little evidence of  much change in the transition rates over time.  The most pronounced change has been a small  increase in the flow into self-employment from inactivity.    Chart 11 shows that self-employment rates have remained roughly constant over time at all  ages except for those above retirement age, which continues to rise for both men and women.  As a  result the average age of the self-employed continues to rise.  Below we present the (weighted) age,  proportion male and proportion immigrant of the self-employed between 2001 and 2006 from the  LFS.    Age  % male  % immigrant            # observations  2001  45.30   73.31    10.26   29,929  2002  45.31      73.10  10.29   29,839  2003   45.40      72.93  10.83   30,486  2004   45.45    73.36  11.10   29,194  2005   45.71    73.13  11.12   29,219  2006   45.84      72.26  12.48   29,137    .  Data are available in the Spring quarter of each year of the LFS from the variables oycirc  and oystat, which report the individual's labour market status and whether they were self-employed  or not a year earlier and is not restricted to those of working age.  These enable us to calculate  transition probabilities for all ages (as in Table 8 and charts 4, 5 and 6).  Reported below is labour  market status in year t-1 for those who were self-employed in year t.  It is apparent that the outflow  rate from self-employment has slowed while the inflow rate from OLF has increased alongside a  decline in the inflow rate from being an employee.    2001-2003    2004-2006                                       (n=20,656)                       (n=19,608)  Self-employed  86.69    87.12  Employee  9.26    8.65  16Unemployed  1.43    1.25  OLF  2.62    2.99    It is also feasible to use these data to identify which industries the new self-employed move  into.  Here we define the new self-employed as individuals who were self-employed in period t, but  not self-employed in t-1.   The industry distribution of the changers is as follows (%).    2001-2003         2004-2006  Agriculture, hunting & forestry      2.99         3.25  Fishing      0.20         0.10  Mining, quarrying      0.22         0.12  Manufacturing      6.95         6.96  Electricity gas & water supply      0.30         0.28  Construction     18.40        19.30  Wholesale, retail & motor trade     11.45        11.44  Hotels & restaurants      3.95         2.57  Transport, storage & communication      7.94         6.48  Financial intermediation      1.99         1.96  Real estate, renting & business activities     20.03        18.94  Public administration & defence      0.87         1.04  Education      3.80         3.81  Health & social work      7.44         7.75  Other community, social & personal      9.99        13.37  Private households with employed persons      3.42         2.59  Extra-territorial organisations      0.03         0.04  N                                          2,950       2,749    The biggest change is the increase in the proportion working in Other Community, Social and  Personal.    At this time it is by no means obvious why the self-employment rate has increased.  In part  it is because of increased immigration alongside moves to self-employment from those who had  previously been OLF.  It does not appear that the most recent increase in self-employment has been  the result of changes in regulation, tax changes or changes in the minimum wage (Blanchflower et  al. 2007a, 2007b).  However, we do believe that rising house prices are a significant explanatory  factor through their ability to ease credit constraints (see below).  172.  Self-employment and Earnings  We make use of data from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and the Survey of Personal  Incomes (SPI) conducted by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to compare the earnings of the  self-employed  with  those  of  employees,  as  the  LFS  does  not  ask  respondents  who  classify  themselves as being self-employed about their labour income(s).  The earnings distributions for the  self-employed and employees are very different.  Median incomes are lower for the self-employed  than for employees, but the self-employed distribution has a longer right hand tail, so somebody  90% up the self-employment earnings distribution has higher earnings than an employee at the 90th  percentile of the wage and salary distribution.  For example, the median gross weekly income from  self-employment in 2005 was £249 (£12,948 annually), according to the FRS.  This compares with  £333 per week (£17,316 annually) for employees (Chart 12a).    The lower weekly income for self- employed workers partly reflects the fact that 6.9% of self-employed workers actually earned  nothing, or lost money as a result of their occupation in 2005.   Excluding these workers causes the  median gross weekly wage rate to rise to £276 (a sixth less than employed workers).    The relative success of those at the top end of the self-employed income distribution is  particularly striking if one looks at means rather than medians; the pay levels of the two groups are  almost identical on this measure (Chart 12b).  This indicates that there are significant returns  available for successful entrepreneurs.  But the fact that more than 80% of self-employed workers  earn less than employees ‘is noteworthy considering the age distribution of the self-employed is  older than that of employees (Weir, 2003)’.          HMRC collects data on individuals’ incomes, principally for tax modelling and forecasting  purposes.  A sample of this data is made available in the form of the SPI, which provides the most  comprehensive and accurate official source of data on personal incomes in the UK. The dataset  18contains a range of variables related to taxable personal incomes arising from employment, self- employment, pensions, benefits, property, savings and investments and other income sources. Also  included are variables related to allowances, deductions and tax relief that people may be due.  A  limitation of the data, however, is that a continuous time series is only available from 1999/00.  The  SPI is carried out annually.11 Data are collected from three HMRC operational IT systems, which  are as follows:  1. COP: this covers all employees and occupational or personal pension recipients  with a PAYE record;  2. CESA: this covers the self assessment (SA) population; those with self-employment,  rent or untaxed investment income, directors and other people with complex tax affairs or high  incomes. Some people have both a COP and CESA record.  3.  Claims: this covers people without COP or CESA records who have had too much  tax deducted at source and claim repayment.  HMRC has kindly supplied data to us on employee and self-employee income distributions  from the SPI, for the financial years 1999/00 to 2003/4.  The distributions are banded, with lower  limit thresholds ranging from zero (for self-employees) to £100,000+.  The data presented below  for 2003/4 indicate that 4.0 million individuals earned some income from self-employment – while  another half a million self-employed reported no positive income.  This compares with 3.63 million  self-reported self-employed in the LFS for the same period.  The difference between the two  numbers reflects the fact that some individuals have more than one job.  Total earnings from self- employment are recorded at £67,750 million in 2003/4, compared with £446,000 million for                                                    11 The approximate sample sizes for recent survey years are as follows: 1999/2000, n=150,000; 2000/2001, n=200,000;  2001/2002, n=300,000; 2002/2003, n=400,000; 2003/2004, n=400,000.    19employees.  Earnings from self-employment therefore represented 13.19% of the combined total of  earnings.

Hamilton (2000) finds similar evidence in the US and argues that this arises in part because of the  non-pecuniary benefits of “being your own boss” (2000, p.628).  Similarly, Taylor (1996), using  data for the UK from the British Household Panel Study for the Autumn of 1991, found that the  self-employed had lower hourly earnings than employees (1996, Appendix).12  Weir (2003), using  data from the 2001/2 FRS, found that the first four fifths of self-employed workers in the income  distribution earn less than the first four-fifths of employees, but the highest one fifth earned more  than employees.  Updating this analysis indicates little change in the distribution over the past  decade. Charts 13a & 13b provide income distributions for 2003/4 and 1994/5 respectively using                                                    12 £8.20 and £9.71 per hour respectively (Taylor, 1996).    20data from the Family Resources Surveys.  These results are broadly supported by data from HMRC  with data for 2003/4 and 1999/00 from the SPI (Charts 14a & 14b), although the proportion of self- employed workers earning more than employees is slightly smaller.      One problem with these earnings measures will be the extent to which the self-employed  under-report their income because they inappropriately charge some of their income to expenses.   There is also the possibility that work is paid for 'under the table' – self-employment allows more  opportunities to work in the black economy.13  It is very difficult to obtain quantitative estimates  for such illegal activities.  Lyssiotou et al (2004) estimate the size of the black economy by  estimating the extent to which self-employment income is underreported in the UK, using data  from the 1993 Family Expenditure Survey. The idea is to use data on consumption to obtain an idea  of  the  degree  of  under-reporting.  Their  empirical  analysis  suggests  that  the  size  of  the  self- employment related black economy in the UK amounts to 10.6% of GDP. They also found that  households  with  a  head  in  a  blue  collar  self-employment  occupation  under-report  more  than  households with a head in a white collar self-employment occupation.    We can appreciate the significant returns available to the most successful entrepreneurs  based in Britain by looking at the Sunday Times Rich List.  The list, which is compiled annually,  records  estimates  of  the  minimum  identifiable  wealth  of  Britain’s  1,000  richest  people  or  families.14  The  results  measure  identifiable  wealth,  whether  land,  property,  racehorses,  art  or  significant shares in publicly quoted companies.  Personal bank accounts are excluded – as access  in not permitted. The most recent valuations available at the time of writing were carried out at the                                                    13 Indeed, Fairlie (2002) finds that a specific group of people who worked in the black economy – drug dealers – were  more likely to be self-employed in the real economy later, presumably because they understood risk taking.    14 The actual size of their fortunes may be much larger than the figures estimated by the Sunday Times.     21beginning of January 2007.15  The results show that the richest entrepreneur in Britain (and 7th in  the  world)  was  Lakshmi  Mittal,  worth  £19,250  million.    The  1,000th  richest  person  had  an  estimated personal fortune of £70 million. Clearly the returns for the most successful self-employed  far  exceed  the  highest  paid  employees  –  although  some  on  the  list  have  made  a  significant  proportion of their wealth as city traders.  The wealthiest trader in the 2007 list, which we might  take to be the wealthiest employee in Britain, was Michael Sherwood, worth an estimated £225  million (319th).  Of those in the 2007 list, 1,028 were men and just 92 were women – the number is higher  than 1,000 because some entries are couples or families.  The eldest entrant was aged 94, while the  youngest was 25.  There are a total of 774 self-made millionaires, while the rest inherited their  wealth.  A fifth of the most wealthy made their fortunes in land and property.  The breakdown by  industry corresponds closely with our previous analysis of the LFS.

Of those that are self-made  billionaires, rather than having inherited their fortunes (as is the case for the Duke of Westminster,  Charlene  and  Michel  de  Carvalho,  and  Kirsten  and  Jorn  Rausing),  six  have  a  degree-level  education and six do not.  None of the British born entrants in the top 15 has a degree.  We could  only find an estimated income figure for Lakshmi Mittal, which was estimated to be £413 million  in 2007.  But are these characteristics the exception or the rule?      233. Who are the self-employed?      Thus far we have explained factors that may exogenously affect individuals’ decisions to  become  self-employed.    But  what  if  some  workers  are  more  pre-disposed  to  becoming  self- employed than others?  It is appropriate at this point to compare the characteristics of the self- employed with those of employees.  We do so by examining weighted means from the UK Labour  Force Surveys.  1. Age  In the LFS, self-employed workers (aged 16+) were on average six years older than their  employed counterparts in 2006 (45.8 vs. 39.3 respectively).  Chart 15 illustrates that the age  distribution of the self-employed is skewed to the right, compared with that for employees.  It  seems  plausible  that  younger  workers  are  less  likely  to  have  the  necessary  human  capital  (experience) to become self-employed.  Younger individuals are probably also more likely to be  credit constrained, limiting a larger proportion of them from starting a new business.  At the other  end of the distribution, older workers face retirement, but that is not an issue for the self-employed.   Indeed, many retirees (either at state pension age or earlier) may take advantage of the opportunity  self-employment brings to remain in the workplace, providing their skills on their own terms.  It is  probably also fair to say that there is an element of risk in becoming self-employed, and this risk  can be minimised if workers have previously ensured financial stability (e.g. mortgage paid off) by  working for others.    2. Gender, marital status and children  The split between male and female employees is roughly equal (56.6% male).  However,  the micro-data suggest that the self-employed are predominantly male (80.1% in 2006).  This  probably reflects the fact that self-employment is more common in industries not usually associated  with high levels of female employment, such as construction (see below).   It may also be a by- product of the fact that a much higher proportion of women are part time workers.   24The self-employed are more likely to be married than employees.                             Employee %     Self-employed %  Single  36        22  Married  53        65  Separated   3         3   Divorced   8         9   Widowed   1         1     The self-employed have more dependent children in their family under the age of 19 (.79 children)  than is the case of employees (.71).16  This is consistent with the findings of Broussard et al (2003)  for the US.  3. Industry & Occupation  The self-employed are more likely to work in occupations that are human-capital and labour  intensive, such as construction, financial activities or agriculture.  Chart 16 shows that nearly a  quarter of self-employed individuals worked in the construction industry in 2006, compared with  just 6% of employees.  A further 20% worked in finance, real estate and business activities and  almost all agricultural employees - though few in total - were self-employed.  In general, we would  think that service sector industries are more suited to self-employment as there will typically be  lower start-up costs, reducing barriers to entry; although a lack of human capital or qualifications to  signal ability (certainly for business activities, such as consultancy) may act as impediments.    4. Education  Chart 17 shows that about a fifth of both employees and self-employed workers had a  degree in 2006.  Indeed, the distributions of the two sets of workers are very similar in general.   The one major difference is the higher proportion of the self-employed with Apprenticeship and  craft qualifications.                                                      16  In sweep 13 of the British Household Panel Study of 2003/4 the (weighted) self-employed also had more children  than employees (.71 and .61 respectively), which includes natural children, adopted children and step children, under  the age of 16.     25Employee  %           Self-employed %  Degree  21  21  Higher education  10  8  Apprenticeship, City & Guild Crafts etc  24  30  GCSE grades A-C  23  17  Other  12  12  None  9  12  DK  1  1    This suggests that the decision to become self-employed is not related to educational attainment,  although, as we noted above, it seems to be more related to age and experience.  This is quite  different from the US where self-employment rates are particularly high among those with higher  degrees,  especially  MBAs  (see  Blanchflower  and  Wainwright,  2005).    We  provide  more  assessment of the differences in the characteristics of the self-employed between the US and the  UK below.  5. Co-workers  The weighted LFS micro-data for 2004-2006 show that three-quarters of the self-employed  work alone or in a partnership.                                                                   Employee                   Self-employed  Works alone/with partner  0%  77%  1-10 employees  18%  18%  11-19 employees  9%  2%  20-24 employees  4%  1%  25-49 employees  14%  1%  50-249 employees  23%  1%  250-499 employees  8%  0.1%  500 or more employees  18%  0.2%  Other  6%  0%    This would seem intuitive for business activities and consultancy, where specialist individuals may  be employed by larger firms, or agriculture, where a lone individual can use technology to tend  many activities.  The distribution by industry for those with and without employees is as below.   The main difference is that the self-employed tend to be sole contractors in construction and have  employees in distribution.  26Works alone             With employees  Agriculture  5%        5%    Energy & water                                             0%         0%   Manufacturing  6%         8%   Construction  26%        16%  Distribution  12%        28%  Transport  8%         5%   Banking  19%        21%  Public administration  10%        10%  Other services  14%         7%      When the self-employed do employ others, more than 90% have fewer than 20 employees.  This is  in stark contrast to the employed, where two-thirds work in firms employing 25 or more workers.   Interestingly, the proportion of the self-employed with employees has shown a steady decline over  time, corroborating the trend in the VAT registrations data presented earlier.                        % with                               % with                   Employees                             Employees  1992  29.1  2000  26.8  1993  27.7  2001  26.8  1994  27.3  2002  24.9  1995  26.7  2003  24.0  1996  25.7  2004  24.1  1997  26.8  2005  23.2  1998  26.4  2006  22.9  1999  26.4      The fact that most self-employed firms are small (in terms of employment) is suggestive of a  degree of flexibility.    6. Hours  The self-employed tend to work longer hours than employees.  On average, the self- employed worked 40 hours per week in 2006, compared with only 34 hours for employees (Chart  18).  However, the self-employed are only marginally less likely than employees to say that they  are part-timers.   For example, the latest figures available at the time of writing are for December  2006-February 2007 and show that 25.7% of employees were part-time compared with 23.6% of  27the self-employed.   Moreover, if the self-employed report that they are part-time they actually  work fewer usual hours than employees (17.3 and 18.1 per week respectively) whereas the reverse  is the case for those who report being full-timers (46.3 and 39.3 hours respectively).   7. Region  There is considerable variation by region in self-employment rates.  In 2006, using region  of work to define location, self-employment rates ranged from under 8% in Tyne and Wear to just  under 19% in Outer London.  Tyne & Wear  7.8  Rest northern region  12.3  South Yorkshire   10.9  West Yorkshire  11.1  Rest Yorks. & Humberside  11.7  East Midlands  11.9  East Anglia  13.4  Central London  8.0  Inner London  18.3  Outer London  18.8  Rest of South East  14.5  South West  13.5  West Midlands Metropolitan  10.0  Rest West Midlands  14.0  Greater Manchester  11.6  Merseyside  9.0  Rest NW  12.2  Wales  12.9  Strathclyde  8.6  Rest of Scotland  11.4  Northern Ireland  15.8    8. Immigrants    There are differences in self-employment rates by race. In 2006, in the UK, the rate for  whites was 13.0% compared with 14.6% for Asians; 8.5% for blacks and 17.1% for Chinese.   The  self-employment rate of immigrants is generally higher than that of the indigenous population.   Clark  and  Drinkwater  (2000),  in  their  study  of  self-employment  among  ethnic  minorities  in  England and Wales, found that minorities who live in areas which have a high percentage of their  28own group are less likely to be self-employed.  They found that those with poor language skills  (typically more recent immigrants) had lower self-employment probabilities.  Borooah and Hart  (1999) used data from the British 1991 Census to examine why so many Indians, but so few black  Caribbeans in Britain are self-employed? Over 20% of economically active Indian males, but only  8% of economically active black Caribbean males, were self-employed.   The reluctance of black  men to become self-employed was, as this study suggested, because of two factors. First, they  were, relative to whites and Indians, “ethnically disinclined” to enter business – this stunted their  desire to be self-employed. Second, they did not possess, relative to whites and Indians, the  attributes that were positively related to entering business – this impaired their ability to be self- employed. The authors estimated that 58% of the observed lack (relative to Indians) of self- employed black males was because of ethnic disinclination and 42% was a result of attribute  disadvantage. Of course this result begs the question of why Caribbean men were disinclined to be  self-employed.  Clark and Drinkwater (2000) also reported that, based on the 1991 Census of  Population, self-employment rates for blacks in England and Wales were 5.8% compared with  26.6% for Chinese and 12.3% for whites and 14.6% for non-whites.17      Column 1 of Table 9 presents data from the Labour Force Surveys of 2004-2006, which  contain data on 633,161 workers and shows that the (weighted) self-employment rate for the UK  born  was  12.5%  compared  with  14.5%  for  immigrants  and  12.7%  overall.    The  data  file  is  restricted to those aged 16-70.  The table also suggests that there is considerable variation in self- employment rates by the immigrants’ country of birth.  Self-employment rates were highest among  those born in Romania (44%), Iran (32%), Thailand (32%), Pakistan (31%) and Turkey (27%) and                                                    17 Using data from the Fourth National Survey of Ethnic Minorities conducted in 1993/1994 Clark and Drinkwater  (2000) found self-employment rates to be especially high, among both men and women, for Pakistanis, Indians and  African Asians.    29lowest for those born in the Philippines (3%), Slovakia (3%) and Finland (1%).  Self-employment  rates tend to be lower for more recent immigrants, in part, for the very obvious reason, that they  tend to be younger.  For example, average self-employment rates and average age based on number  of years in the UK for immigrants is as follows (LFS 2004-2006)        Self-employment rate      Average age  <2 years  4.9%  29.5  < 5 years  7.1%  30.9  5-9 years  13.0%  33.8  10-19 years  15.9%  37.2  ≥20 years    28.0%  40.4      In the second column of Table 9 we present equivalent evidence on self-employment rates  by country of birth for the United States using data for 2,552,483 workers from the Basic Monthly  files of the Current Population Survey.  Here we define self-employment to include both the  unincorporated and the incorporated self-employed.  In the official statistics the self-employment  rate only includes the unincorporated, although their earnings are not included in wage and salary  measures.18    We  only  present  evidence  for  countries  where  there  are  matched  pairs  -  these  exclusions are not significant. In the US, the self-employment rate of immigrants (10.1%) is  marginally less than that of the indigenous population (10.6%).  The self-employment rate of the  UK born in the US (12.8%) is virtually identical to the rate in the UK as a whole (12.7%).  In  contrast the self-employment rates, of those born in the US who reside in the UK, (17.6%) is higher  than in the US (10.6%).  Interestingly, there is no correlation between the self employment rates  across the two countries.                                                        18 See, for example, Table 591 of the 2007 Statistical Abstract of the United States   www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0591.xls.    309.  Self-employed second jobs  The LFS data indicate that a number of individuals who are employees also work self- employed in a second job.  It turns out that this is a particularly important phenomenon in the  public sector, especially among academics and health professionals, including therapists.  It is  especially high for those with higher degrees.  Overall, 0.9% of employees in their main job had a  second job that was self-employed: the rate was 0.6% in the private sector and 1.5% in the public.    Private sector  0.6%  Public sector  1.5%  Public company, PLC    0.7%   Nationalised industry   0.6%    Central Govt., Civil Service   0.9%    Local Govt. or council (inc police etc)    1.4%   University, etc   3.0%     Health authority or NHS trust    1.8%    Charity, voluntary orgn. etc   2.5%     Armed forces     0.3%  Other public organisation   1.0%    UK  0.9%    10.  Happiness, life and job satisfaction  The  self-employed  are  generally  more  satisfied  with  their  jobs  than  employees  (Blanchflower  and  Oswald,  1998;  Blanchflower,  2004;  Green  and  Tsitsianis,  2006).    In  an  important paper, Frey and Benz (2002) examine job satisfaction data for the UK, Germany and  Switzerland and find evidence that the self-employed are more satisfied at work than employees.   What is impressive about this paper is that the authors have panel data over a number of years on  the same individuals for both the UK (1991-1999) and Germany (1984-2000) and show that this  result remains even in the presence of people specific fixed effects.  There is also some recent  evidence from Finland suggesting that the self-employed are less risk averse than employees.   Ekelund et al (2005) used data from the 1966 Northern Finnish Birth Cohort Study.  Unfortunately  the measure of risk-aversion is a contemporaneous one so it is difficult to determine causality.    31The self-employed seem to like their jobs despite the fact that their work isn’t easy.  The  self-employed report that they a) work under a lot of pressure, b) find their work stressful, c) come  home from work exhausted, d) are constantly under strain, e) lose sleep over worry, f) place more  weight on work than they do on leisure, but g) are especially likely to say they have control over  their lives (Blanchflower, 2004).    The self-employed in the UK also tend to report relatively high levels of happiness and life  satisfaction (Blanchflower, 2004; Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004) and job satisfaction (Taylor,  2004; Green and Tsitsianis, 2005).  To illustrate, the European Quality of Life Survey of 2003  asked respondents for their happiness, life satisfaction and job satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10,  with 10 being highest.  The weighted average job satisfaction score for the UK was 8.31 for the  self-employed and 7.22 for employees.  The weighted scores for life satisfaction and happiness for  the UK in 2003 were as follows:                                   Life satisfaction                    Happiness                                          (n=980)             (n=984)  Self-employed  7.7  8.0  Employee     7.4  7.9  Homemaker      6.9  7.6  Unemployed       6.5  6.7  Retired     7.5  7.9  Student      7.7  8.1     Results are similar in the British Household Panel Study Sweep 13 taken primarily during 2004  with around 8% of responses in 2005.  Levels of overall job satisfaction – based on a scale of 1  through seven - were 5.7 for the self-employed and 5.4 for employees.  In addition the self- employed were also less satisfied with their job security (5.0 and 5.5) and their hours (5.0 and 5.3).   Analogously the self-employed scored 5.4 and employees 5.2 when asked if they were satisfied  with their life overall, once again on a scale of 1-7.  The self-employed in the UK score highly on  job satisfaction, life satisfaction and happiness.    3211.  Independence  The self-employed are especially likely to report that they value their independence. Benz  and Frey (2003) examined data on 23 countries from the International Social Survey Programme  (ISSP). They conclude that the self-employed are more satisfied with their jobs because they enjoy  ‘greater autonomy and independence’. In a recent paper Hundley (2001) provides results for the  U.S. which, are similar to those of Benz and Frey.  His main findings are that the self-employed are  more satisfied because their work provides more autonomy, flexibility and skill utilisation and  greater job security.  In the Flash Eurobarometer Survey #160 conducted in April 2004 individuals  in EU member countries were asked "suppose you could choose between different kinds of jobs,  which one would you prefer – being an employee or self-employed?".  On average 47.1% said they  would prefer to be self-employed.  The individuals who said they were self-employed were asked  to give reasons why and were allowed to provide multiple answers. The major reason by far was  ‘personal independence/self-fulfilment/interesting tasks’.   On average across these countries, 70%  gave this answer - the next highest response was ‘better income prospects (23%).  Responses by  country on independence are in column 1 below (n=9,358).  Only in the US did fewer than half of  the respondents give this answer, but a further 61% in the US said ‘no need to adapt to an  environment’.   These proportions by country are in the second column below               Independence   No need to adapt              %                     %  Austria     76  19  Belgium        69  10  Cyprus     69  11  Czech Republic     81  55  Denmark     83  6  Estonia     84  7  Finland     79  22  France     86  12  Germany     85  22  Greece    80  30  Hungary   65  26  33Iceland     67  7  Ireland     84  4  Italy     80  18  Latvia   61  43  Lichtenstein   80  28  Lithuania   64  26  Luxembourg      59  19  Malta   80  8  Netherlands      72  30  Norway   77  14  Poland   66  10  Portugal     62  11  Slovakia    64  28  Slovenia     73  5  Spain     66  7  Sweden     75  9  UK     81  9  USA   21  61    The self-employed report that they like another aspect of independence, the flexibility the  job  brings  and  the  fact  that  they  can  pick  their  schedule  (Hytinnen  and  Ruuskanen,  2007).   However, the self-employed are especially likely to report being stressed (Blanchflower, 2004).   Respondents in the 14th sweep of the BHPS were asked "Do you worry about job problems after  work?"  Weighted responses were as follows (%).                                                    Employee      Self-employed  Never   42.6        35.1  Occasionally   31.3        29.4  Some of the time   16.9        22.6  Much of the time   4.8         6.9   Most of the time   3.1         3.8   All of the time    1.3           2.2      The self-employed were more likely than employees to worry about job problems after work.                  344. Econometric analysis of the probability of a randomly selected worker being self-employed    Given the differences that exist in the characteristics of the self-employed in terms of their  location, occupation, industry, schooling, age and gender it is appropriate to examine the extent to  which there have been changes over time, holding constant these characteristics, in a regression  framework.   There is a growing body of research that has examined the probability that a randomly  sampled worker is self-employed (see Blanchflower 2000, 2004 for a summary).  The main results  from this work are as follows.  Self-employment is higher among men than women; among older  workers than younger workers.  It is also especially high among some immigrant groups, such as  Asians. It does vary by location, being especially high in construction occupations, agriculture and  retailing.  These results are updated below.  Tables 10 and 11 report the results of estimating the probability of a randomly selected  worker being self-employed.  The dependent variable is set to one if self-employed, zero if an  employee; the estimation procedure is dprobit in STATA.19  Data used are from the Labour Force  Survey and in Table 10 cover the period for January 1994 - December 1996, while Table 11  performs an equivalent exercise ten years later from January 2004 - December 2006.  In the first  period,  the  mean  self-employment  rate  in  our  data  was  13.7%  compared  with  12.7%  in  the  subsequent  period.    Where  feasible  identical  controls  are  included;  the  major  exception  is  occupation because of changes in the classification system used by the ONS in 2000.  Controls in  column 1 include age and its square; a gender dummy; four race dummies and six schooling  dummies. As we move across the columns controls are added - an immigrant dummy in column 2;                                                    19 The dprobit procedure in STATA fits maximum-likelihood probit models and is an alternative to probit.  Rather than  reporting the coefficients, dprobit reports the marginal effect, that is the change in the probability for an infinitesimal  change in each independent, continuous variable and, by default, reports the discrete change in the probability for  dummy variables.    35region of residence and industry dummies in column 3 and occupation dummies in column 4.   Interestingly, the patterns in the means isolated above are robust in the regressions.   The main findings are as follows.  1.  The probability of self-employment rises non-linearly with age and reaches a maximum at age  63.8 in column 1 of Table 10 and at age 70 in column 4.  In column 1 of Table 11, for the later  period the maximum was 76.7 compared with 73.0 in column 4.  The positive sign on the age  variable and the negative sign on the age squared term permits the calculation of these maxima.  2.  The probability of self-employment is higher for men, whites, Asians and immigrants generally,  as well as for those with A-levels or equivalent, of which over half are individuals with trade  apprenticeships (5.5%) or City & Guilds Advanced Craft Qualifications (45.3%).   Probabilities are  also high in the South West and London as well as in Agriculture and Construction.  Occupations  with high self-employment rates include Health Professionals; Construction Trades; Hairdressers;  Artistic and Sports Occupations and Agricultural Occupations.  3.  The probability of self-employment is relatively low for blacks and those with Higher Education  qualifications, which primarily include NVQ level 4 and teaching qualifications.  It is also low in  Distribution and Manufacturing and, of course, in the Public Sector.  Ceteris paribus rates were  lowest in Tyne and Wear in both periods.  4.  It is apparent that the patterns that emerge in Table 11 for 2004-2006 are very similar to those  for the period 1994-1996.  The age maximum increased over time, as noted above, but the gender,  education and race gaps were broadly unchanged.  Table 12 presents the results of estimating a further dprobit modelling the probability that  an employee in their main job will have a second job where they are self-employed.  So the  dependent variable is one if an employee in the first job and self-employed in the second zero  36otherwise.  All those reporting being self-employed in their first job are omitted.  Probabilities are  higher for men, whites and rise with age reaching a maximum over the age 54 in column 3.  They  are especially high in London and East Anglia.  As noted earlier, self-employed second jobs are  especially important for people with higher degrees and teaching qualifications and are particularly  important in universities.  If we count these individuals into the self-employment count they add  nearly a percentage point (mean=0.87%).    How do the characteristics of the self-employed in the UK compare with those in the United  States?  As  background,  Table  13  provides  details  of  the  distribution  of  incorporated  and   unincorporated self-employment and wage and salary employment by gender, race and whether  foreign born for the US in 2005.20  There were approximately twice as many unincorporated self- employed than incorporated – 10 and a half million and 5 and a quarter million respectively.  The  incidence of self-employment is highest in middle age and is higher among men.  In comparison  with wage and salary work, minorities are under-represented in self-employment.  For example,  11.5% of wage and salary workers are black compared with 6.3% of unincorporated and 3.7% of  incorporated self-employed and similarly for the foreign born.  In contrast, Asians have a higher  representation in incorporated self-employment than they do in wage and salary work.      Table 14 presents econometric evidence for the United States comparable to that for the UK  in Table A.11, again for 2004-2006, using data from the Basic Monthly files of the Current  Population Survey (BMCPS) for the same years as in Table 11.  The US sample size is four times  larger at over two and a half million workers.  The dependent variable is defined in the same way  as in Tables 10 and 11, set to one if self-employed and zero if an employee.  As in Table 9, the self-                                                   20 Note that the unincorporated self-employment rate is actually constructed as in Table 9 as the proportion of the  unincorporated self-employed over total workers, which in 2005 was 7.4%.        37employed  includes  both  the  incorporated  and  unincorporated  (Blanchflower  and  Wainwright,  2005).      It is necessary, however, to make an adjustment in the various regressions we report  because there are repeat observations of individuals and households in the Current Population  Survey.  This has the effect of biasing downwards the size of the standard errors and biasing  upwards the t-statistics, although it will leave the size of the estimated coefficients unchanged.  The  intuition is that the same people are in the survey multiple times, which causes a statistical problem  as the econometric method assumes we are sampling different people.  If we did not do this  adjustment this would have the effect of wrongly suggesting statistical significance when it was not  present, although practically this has little effect as the standard errors are generally so small.    To adjust for the problem of repeat observations we cluster the standard errors at the level  of the household using the cluster procedure in the econometric software program STATA.  In total  there are more than half a million data points for the period 2004-2006.21  Care has also to be taken  because the individual identifiers in the BMCPS are recycled, which means that once an individual  leaves the survey that number is given to another individual as they join the sample.  These  individual identifiers are recycled to individuals in the same area.  Given this recycling problem we  have had to adjust the data a second time to ensure that individuals and households are identified  appropriately.  We do so by creating a new identifier with the year the household first appears in  the data file appended to the end of the original identifier, which solves the problem.     The main results are as follows - where possible we draw direct comparisons with results  from the UK, for the same period 2004-2006, in Table 11.                                                    21 The data and documentation are downloadable from the NBER website at http://www.nber.org/data/cps_basic.html.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics also maintains a CPS website at http://www.bls.census.gov/cps/ with a great deal of  information about the survey and access to downloads of recent data.    381.  The self-employment rate of men is higher than it is for women.  It rises with age and reaches a  maximum of 67.1 in column 1 and 72.5 in column 4.  Probabilities are higher for immigrants  holding constant characteristics, which was not true in the means.  2.  Self-employment rates for blacks are lower than for whites both in the UK and the US.  3.  In  contrast  to  the  UK,  self-employment  rates  are  highest  for  those  with  professional  qualifications such as an MBA and a PhD in the US.  4.  Rates are highest in Montana and California and lowest in West Virginia, Delaware and the  District of Columbia.  5.  As in the UK, self-employment rates are highest in Agriculture and Construction and among  Artistic and Sporting as well as Sales occupations.  They are also high in the US among Personal  Care and Service Occupations.    Finally, Table 15 reports self-employment probabilities across EU member states using data  from the Eurobarometer data series.  The first column covers data from 14 member countries plus  Norway for the period 1974-2002.  Column 2 performs a similar exercise, but for a very recent  sweep of the Eurobarometer series, from December 2005- January 2006 and includes a larger  sample of countries, including the new East European member states.  In both cases the UK is the  excluded category. The dependent variable once again is one if self-employed, zero if an employee.   The main evidence from this table is as follows.  1.  There has been a declining time trend in the incidence of self-employment across member  states.  2.  Self-employment rates are higher for men and for those with less schooling.  3.  There is no evidence that the age squared term is significant - the probability of being self- employed rises linearly with age in each column.  394.  In comparison to the UK, based on column 2, self-employment rates are significantly higher in  Turkish Cyprus; the Czech Republic; East Germany; Greece; Italy; Poland; Romania and Turkey.     To summarise, self-employment probabilities in the UK rise with age, are high for men,  whites, immigrants, individuals with trade apprenticeships, workers in the South West and London  as well as in Agriculture and Construction.  Occupations with high self-employment rates include  Health  Professionals;  Construction  Trades;  Hairdressers;  Artistic  and  Sports  Occupations  and  Agricultural Occupations.  Broadly similar patterns are found in both the US and the EU.    5. Liquidity constraints  Even though approximately one worker in eight is self-employed in the UK there appears to  remain a strong desire among employees to be self-employed.  Blanchflower, Oswald and Stutzer  (2001) examined data from the 1997/8 International Social Survey Programme and found that  nearly half of employees in the UK expressed a desire to be self-employed.  New data have  recently become available from five sweeps of the Entrepreneurship Flash Eurobarometers on the  same issue.  There is consistent evidence in Table 16 from both data sources that approximately  half of all wage workers in the UK say they would prefer to be self-employed; this pattern is  repeated in other countries in the survey and is especially high in the US and Portugal.22       This raises an important puzzle. Why do so few individuals manage to translate their  preferences into action?  Lack of start-up capital appears to be one likely explanation.    In work based on US micro data at the level of the individual, Evans and Leighton (1989),  and Evans and Jovanovic (1989), have argued that entrepreneurs face liquidity constraints.  The  authors use the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men for 1966-1981, and the Current  Population Surveys for 1968-1987.  The key test shows that, all else remaining equal, people with                                                    22 Sample sizes in Table 16 are as follows: column 2 n=32,606; column 3 =31,868; column 4=31,604.  40greater family assets are more likely to switch to self-employment from employment.  This asset  variable enters probit equations significantly and with a quadratic form.  Although Evans and his  collaborators draw the conclusion that capital and liquidity constraints bind, this claim is open to  the  objection  that  other  interpretations  of  their  correlation  are  feasible.    One  possibility,  for  example, is that inherently acquisitive individuals both start their own businesses and forego leisure  to build up family assets.  In this case, there would be a correlation between family assets and  movement into self-employment even if capital constraints did not exist.  A second possibility is  that the correlation between family assets and the movement to self-employment arises because  children tend to inherit family firms.  Parker (2002) provides some much needed theory on whether  banks ration enterprises.  Blanchflower  and  Oswald  (1998),  find  that  the  probability  of  self-employment  depends  positively upon whether the individual ever received an inheritance or gift.  Burke et al (2000,  2002) replicate the findings using the same data source.  Work by Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian and  Rosen (1994a, 1994b), drew similar conclusions using different methods on US data.  Lindh and  Ohlsson (1994) adopt the Blanchflower-Oswald procedure and provide complementary evidence  for Sweden.  Bernhardt (1994), in a study for Canada, using data from the 1981 Social Change in  Canada Project also found evidence that capital constraints appear to bind.  And Kidd (1993) also  reported that the availability of capital in Australia is a significant barrier to self-employment.    Taylor (2001), in an interesting paper that uses the British Household Panel Study for the  period 1994-1996, explores the impact of windfall gains on self-employment.  A windfall payment  is defined as being from a personal accident claim; a redundancy payment; an annual/seasonal  bonus from employment; a win on the football pools; national lottery or other sort of gambling; or  anything else.  Taylor finds that the size of the payment received has a positive, and concave,  41impact on the probability of entering self-employment and on the performance of an existing self- employed enterprise, once again consistent with the liquidity constraint hypothesis.  Georgellis et al  (2005) extend Taylor's analysis to the later period 1994-2000.  The authors find evidence of  significant capital constraints - windfalls raise the probability of transition into self-employment at  a decreasing rate.    Johansson (2000a, 2000b), in studies for Finland, used a unique data file drawn from the  Longitudinal Employment Statistics, compiled by Statistics Finland.  It covers the years 1987-1995  and includes, in principle, every individual who has had a job in Finland during the period – it is  the population.  A sample of just over 100,000 workers aged 18-65 was randomly selected and they  were followed from 1987-1994.  Johannsson’s empirical strategy was to model the probability of  an individual entering self-employment.  The main result from the study was that a higher level of  wealth significantly increased the probability that an individual made a transition from wage- employment to self-employment. Yannis and Wall (2005) find that capital constraints in Germany  based  on  the  GSOEP  are  especially  important  for  men  in  explaining  movements  into  self- employment.  Moreover Holtz-Eakin and Rosen (2005), also using the GSOEP, found that German  workers faced capital constraints that are more severe than those faced by American workers.    Hurst and Lusardi (2004) have claimed that there is little evidence that lack of wealth  constrains  entrepreneurship apart from  at the top of the wealth distribution –  above the 95th  percentile.  They make this claim using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for the  period 1989-1994, which contains only 7,500 observations.  Very few people in their data – only  304 or 4% - actually transit into self-employment.  It appears that their results are driven entirely by  measurement error and hence should be ignored.  Not finding evidence for something in a poorly  specified equation tells us little or nothing about the role of capital constraints or of wealth in  42setting up a business.  Indeed, Fairlie and Krashinsky (2006) examined this issue in some detail.   They demonstrate that, using the PSID also, and bifurcating the sample into workers who enter  self-employment after job loss and those who do not reveals steadily increasing entry rates as assets  increase in both sub-samples.  They argue that these two groups merit a separate analysis, because  the two groups face different incentives, and thus have different solutions to the entrepreneurial  decision.  Second, they used micro-data from matched Current Population Surveys (1993-2004) to  demonstrate  that  housing  appreciation  measured  at  the  MSA-level  is  a  significantly  positive  determinant of entry into self-employment.  Their estimates indicate that a 10 percent annual  increase  in housing  equity  increases  the  mean probability of  entrepreneurship  by  roughly  20  percent and that the effect is not concentrated at the upper tail of the distribution.   Fairlie and  Krashinsky's  (2006)  findings  on  the  relationship  between  housing  appreciation  and  entrepreneurship are consistent with the liquidity constraint hypothesis.     Using the 1991 French Household Survey of Financial Assets, Laferrere and McEntee  (1995), examined the determinants of self-employment using data on intergenerational transfers of  wealth, education, informal human capital and a range of demographic variables. They also find  evidence  of  the  importance  played  by  the  family  in  the  decision  to  enter  self-employment.  Intergenerational transfers of wealth, familial transfers of human capital and the structure of the  family  were  found  to  be  determining  factors  in  the  decision  to  move  from  wage  work  into  entrepreneurship.      Broussard et al. (2003) found that the self-employed in the US have between .2 and .4 more  children compared to the non-self-employed.  The authors argue that having more children can  increase the likelihood that an inside family member will be a good match at running the business.   One might also think that the existence of family businesses, which are particularly prevalent in  43farming, is a further way to overcome the existence of capital constraints.  Transfers of firms within  families will help to preserve the status quo and will work against the interests of blacks in  particular, who do not have as strong a history of business ownership as indigenous whites.      Analogously, Hout and Rosen (2000) found that the offspring of self-employed fathers are  more likely than others to become self-employed (see also Dunn and Holtz-Eakin, 2000).  These  studies generally find that an individual who had a self-employed parent is roughly two to three  times more likely to be self-employed than someone who did not have a self-employed parent.   More  recently  Fairlie  and  Robb  (2006)  have  demonstrated,  using  data  from  the  1992  Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) Survey, that more than half of all business owners had a  self-employed family member prior to starting their business.  Conditional on having a self- employed family member, less than 50 percent of small business owners worked in that family  member's business suggesting that it is unlikely that intergenerational links in self-employment are  largely the result of the acquisition of general and specific business human capital and that instead  similarities  across  family  members  in  entrepreneurial  preferences  may  explain  part  of  the  relationship.  In contrast, estimates from regression models conditioning on business ownership  indicated that having a self-employed family member plays only a minor role in determining small  business outcomes, whereas the human capital acquired from prior work experience in a family  member's business appears to be very important for business success.  Estimates from the CBO also  indicated that only 1.6 percent of all small businesses are inherited suggesting that the role of  business inheritances in determining intergenerational links in self-employment is limited at best.       Fairlie and Meyer (2000), rule out a number of explanations for the difference in the self- employment rates of white and black males.  They found that trends in demographic factors,  including the Great Migration and the racial convergence in education levels “did not have large  44effects on the trend in the racial gap in self-employment” (p. 662). They also found that an initial  lack of business experience “cannot explain the current low levels of black self-employment.”  Further they found that “the lack of traditions in business enterprise among blacks that resulted  from slavery cannot explain a substantial part of the current racial gap in self-employment” (p.  664). Fairlie (1999) and Wainwright (2000) have shown that a considerable part of the explanation  of the differences between the African American and white self-employment rate can be attributed  to discrimination. Bates (1989) finds strong supporting evidence that racial differences in levels of  financial capital have significant effects upon racial patterns in business failure rates.  Fairlie  (1999) also found that the black exit rate from self-employment is twice as high as that of whites.    Using the same 1992 Characteristics of Business Owners (CBO) Survey, Fairlie and Robb  (2005) examined why African-American owned businesses lag substantially behind white-owned  businesses in sales, profits, employment, and survival.  Black business owners, they found, were  much less likely than white owners to have had a self-employed family member prior to starting  their business and are less likely to have worked in that family member's business.  They found  further that the lack of prior work experience in a family business among black business owners,  perhaps by limiting their acquisition of general and specific business human capital, negatively  affects black business outcomes    Blanchflower,  Levine  and  Zimmerman  (2003)  examined  the  availability  of  credit  to  minority and female-owned small businesses using data from the 1993 and 1998 National Surveys  of Small Business Finances conducted by the Reserve Board of Governors.  They demonstrated  that loan denial probabilities for African-American owned firms are approximately double those for  comparable white-owned firms.  Even when African-Americans were able to obtain loans they  have to pay higher interest rates.  Comparable, but smaller effects are found for Hispanics.  These  45differences  were  not  explained  by  differences  in  creditworthiness  or  other  observables.  Such  differences disappeared when the use of credit cards was examined, where the banks were unaware  of the race of the applicant.  The authors found that firms owned by minorities are discriminated  against in the credit market.  Similar results were found by Cavalluzzo, Cavalluzzo and Wolken  (2002).    A recent study published by the US Chamber of Commerce (2005) confirms the findings in  Blanchflower, Levine and Zimmerman (2003).  The survey was conducted in March and April  2005 and detailed the financing problems experienced by small business owners, 95% of whom  had less than 100 employees: 1,080 business owners were interviewed and reported that minority  businesses rely heavily on credit cards to fund their businesses, often do not apply for credit, even  though they need it, for fear of being denied and were especially likely to need working capital.   In  particular they report that the availability of credit is their top problem, exactly as reported by  Blanchflower,  Levine  and  Zimmerman  (2003).    The  biggest  difference  in  responses  between  minorities and Caucasian men and women was availability of credit:  19% of Caucasian males  report credit as their top problem compared with 54% for minority males – a 35 percentage point  difference.  There was a 15 percentage point difference for women.  In no other category is there  more than a 10 percentage point difference for men or women.      It is appropriate to examine some new empirical evidence which appears to support the  proposition that liquidity constraints bind on small businesses.  First we examine the impact of  inheritances and gifts and then the role of rising house prices and find they both appear to generate  more self-employment.      Table 17 uses new evidence from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) on the  incidence of self-employment among workers in their mid forties.  The NCDS is a birth cohort  46study covering every individual born in the week 3rd-9th March 1958.  Blanchflower and Oswald  (1998) examined the impact of inheritances and gifts on the probability of an individual being self- employed on sweeps four and five conducted at ages twenty-three and thirty-three respectively.  In  that paper it was found that an exogenous shock or windfall in the form of an inheritance or gift -  received at any point from birth to age twenty three - and expressed in 1981 pounds raised the  probability of self-employment.  New data have recently become available on the seventh sweep of  the NCDS conducted in 2004/2005 when the respondents were aged 46 or 47.  It turns out that the  higher the value of an inheritance or gift the higher is the probability of self-employment not only  at ages twenty-three and thirty-three but also, more than twenty years later, at age 46/47.  This  result remains even when controlling for education and the social class of the respondent's mother's  husband (usually the father) when the respondent was aged eleven.  Having a father who was self- employed  -  even  when  the  respondent  was  young,  at  age  11  -  raises  the  probability  of  the  respondent being self-employed thirty-five years later.  It turns out, also that a Copying Design test  score conducted at age eleven is a significant predictor of whether or not the respondent is self- employed thirty-five years later.  Other controls including Verbal and Non-Verbal IQ, Math and  Reading test scores at ages 7, 11 and 16 were everywhere insignificant.  Results are the same in  column 4 when the dependent variable is set to zero not only for employees, but also for the  unemployed and those who are out of the labour force (OLF). Lack of start-up capital is a likely  explanation why individual’s ambitions to be self-employed do not meet fruition.  Blanchflower  and  Oswald  (1998)  also  found  that  when  directly  questioned  in  interview  surveys,  potential  entrepreneurs say that raising capital is their principal problem.       Another type of windfall is an increase in house prices, which may help home owners to  overcome capital constraints by releasing home equity.  Rising house prices, for example, enable  47liquidity constrained nascent entrepreneurs to start a business, or even to enable it to survive.   Black et al (1996), for example, found that a 10% rise in the value of housing equity increased the  number of new firm VAT registrations in the UK by some 5%.  Taylor (2004) found that an  increase  in  house  prices  increased  the  probability  of  self-employment  entry.    Chart  8  above  suggested that, at the national level, changes in self-employment and nominal house price inflation  moved reasonably closely together.  The self-employment rate ticked up in 2005 as house prices  rose and fell at the end of the 1980s as house prices fell.    We explore this relationship more closely in Table A.18, where we regress the log of the  self-employment rate, defined by region and year, on the (log) house price and the log of the  regional unemployment rate, as well as a full set of year dummies and a lagged dependent variable.  The year dummies can be thought of as proxying inflation, so the house price variable should be  thought of as being in real terms.  The year dummies will also capture any time-variant, year- specific factors that affect all regions symmetrically – such as changes in legislation.    In each of the columns 1-4, the house price variable enters significantly, with or without a  lagged dependent variable or with region fixed effects.  The unemployment rate is significant in  columns 1 and 3 (although of opposite sign), but not in the presence of the lagged dependent  variable.  The unemployment rate does become significant in column 5, however, where the year  dummies are replaced with an (insignificant) price deflator, but this equation fails to account for the  effects of legislative changes.  The house price elasticity of our preferred equation (column 4)  means that a doubling of house prices leads to an increase in the self-employment rate of 9.5%, so  the effect isn’t small.  We take this as evidence of liquidity constraints being eased for nascent  entrepreneurs as house prices rise, entirely consistent with the findings of Black et al. (1996) for the  period 1966-1990, Cowling and Mitchell (1997) for the period 1972-1992, and Taylor (2004) for  48the period 1970-2001.  Henley (2005) also shows the importance of housing wealth for the self- employed in job creation.  It is also consistent with Fairlie and Krashinsky's (2006) findings for the  US on the positive relationship between housing appreciation and the prevalence of  entrepreneurship.    Between 2005Q1 and 2007Q1 approximately 70% of the growth in total UK employment  has been from self-employment (217k out of 305k), raising the self-employment rate from 12.6  percentage points to 13.2 percentage points, which is an increase of 4.9%.  Over the same period  aggregate UK house prices have appreciated by 14.7%.  Solving out the long run elasticity of the  self-employment rate wrt to (log) house prices from column 4 of Table A.18, gives +0.17123:    ln self-employment ratet = .4440 ln self-employment ratet-1 + .0952 ln house pricest   To give an indication of how to interpret the size of this elasticity of 0.171, such a number  means that if house prices double the associated long-run impact is to increase the self-employment  rate by approximately a sixth.  This elasticity therefore suggests that rising house prices can  potentially explain approximately half (14.7 * .171 = 2.5%) of the observed 4.9% increase in the  UK self-employment rate between 2005 and 2007.  Liquidity constraints continue to bind for  small-businesses in the UK.    6. Discussion and conclusions    Self-employment rose sharply in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, encouraged by  focussed government intervention and supported by financial liberalisation.  The period was also  characterised by sustained and rapid economic growth.  But did greater self-employment cause  heightened growth?                                                        23 .0952/(1-.4440)  49Greater numbers of self-employed workers in an economy should, in theory, increase labour  market flexibility in response to demand shocks because there is no binding wage contract on the  number of hours worked.  In turn, Millard (2000) argues that this should lead to greater output and  consumption  and  lower  unemployment.    There  is  no  empirical  evidence  to  support  such  a  theoretical proposition.  As we noted above, self-employment appears to be uncorrelated with  unemployment,  although  transitions  between  employees  and  self-employment  are  negatively  correlated  with  unemployment,  while  transitions  from  unemployment  to  self-employment  are  positively correlated.  In aggregate these two effects roughly cancel each other out.  What about  any relationship with output?  Evidence from a series of GDP growth equations for twenty-three countries over the period  1966-1996 presented in Blanchflower (2000) suggested that a higher self-employment rate does not  increase  the  real  growth  rate  of  the  economy;  in  fact  there  was  even  some  evidence  to  the  contrary.24  We repeat this analysis here for a longer time period and more countries. Table 19  examines the relationship between the growth in real GDP and changes in the self-employment  rate, using time series data on the 30 OECD countries for the period 1967-2005 (the additional  seven countries are Czech Republic, Hungary, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland).   As in Blanchflower (2000), the regressions should be thought of as a Cobb-Douglas production  function, where the change in the numbers of employees over the previous period is included to  distinguish the labour input.  Capital is assumed to grow linearly and as the model is estimated in  changes the effect of capital will be in the constant. Also included in the regressions are a set of  country dummies plus a lagged dependent variable. The columns in Table 19 experiment with                                                    24 The twenty-three countries were Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Eire, Finland, France, Germany,  Greece, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK  and the USA    50different measures of self-employment.  Columns 1 and 2 define self-employment as the number of  self-employed as a percentage of total employment.  Columns 3 and 4 define self-employment as  the  number  of  non-agricultural  self-employed  as  a  percentage  of  total  non-agricultural  employment.25  These results presume a particular direction of causation, from self-employment to  growth and not the reverse.  Columns 1 and 3 include the change in the self-employment rate and a  lagged GDP term. Columns 2 and 4 add the change in the number of employees.  In no case is the  change in the self-employment rate significant: experimenting with longer lags produced similar  results.  The results confirm Blanchflower’s (2000) earlier findings, but for a richer data set – we  find no evidence that changes in self-employment are correlated with changes in real GDP.   Another  measure  of  economic  benefit  could  be  greater  happiness.    Table  20  presents  evidence on life satisfaction using data from the Eurobarometer trend file of 1970-2002 for 16  European countries in column 1 and for the UK in column 2.  The final column uses data from the  most recently available (14th) sweep of the British Household Panel Study of 2004/5.  In all three  columns the self-employed have significantly higher life satisfaction than do employees.  So can a  higher self-employment rate lead to greater aggregate happiness?  The results are not supportive.   We substituted mean life satisfaction scores on a four point scale taken from the World Database of  Happiness for 1976-2006 for GDP growth and repeated our previous analysis.  The question asked  was "How satisfied are you with the life you lead? – very satisfied; fairly satisfied; not very  satisfied;  not at all satisfied, where very is coded as 4 down through not at all which is coded as 1.   We include GDP growth as an explanatory variable, along with inflation and the unemployment  rate and a complete set of country and year dummies.26  Self-employment fails to provide any                                                    25 A split excluding non-agricultural data is not available for Switzerland.      26 The results are as follows, with the dependent variable being the mean life satisfaction score in year t.    51incremental information in explaining happiness when these other variables are included.  We find  evidence that both unemployment and inflation lower happiness, although the effect is greater for  unemployment than it is for inflation, as found by Di Tella et al (2001) and Wolfers (2003).  The  GDP term, which they did not include, enters significantly positive.  It remains uncertain why self- employment enters positively into a micro-level happiness equation, but not into a macro-level  equation.  These results, of course, do not mean that higher self-employment is a bad thing.  A very  high proportion of individuals across a number of surveys express the desire to become self- employed.  We certainly find no evidence that more self-employment is bad for the economy. The  self-employed seem to especially value their independence.  Many governments around the world  believe that it is appropriate to try and make their economies more entrepreneurial, but that need  not necessarily  imply a  higher  self-employment  rate.    And  it  also  means  that  a  higher  self- employment rate cannot be expected to translate directly into greater economic success.  A lower  self-employment rate could conceivably be better.  Can we imagine a society consisting almost  exclusively of wage and salary workers?  It would seem unlikely that a self-employment rate  around  zero  would  be  optimal.    Unfortunately,  we  have  no  way  of  knowing  what  number  governments should be aiming for.  Market forces need to prevail and Blanchflower’s (2004)  conclusion stands; more may not be better.  Let the market rip.

T-statistics in  parentheses.      52The probability of being self-employed in the United Kingdom is higher for men and rises  non-linearly with age. Those with craft qualifications, including trade apprenticeships, are more  likely to be self-employed, and rates are higher for those working in the construction or retailing  industries.  Immigrants are more likely to be self-employed, but there is considerable variation by  country of birth.  Probabilities are also high in the South West and London as well as in Agriculture  and Construction.  Occupations with high self-employment rates include Health Professionals;  Construction Trades; Hairdressers; Artistic and Sports Occupations and Agricultural Occupations.  In the US, the probabilities are higher the more educated a person is, while the opposite is  true in Europe.  Financial windfalls or housing capital gains are important explanatory variables for  self-employment, through their ability to mitigate liquidity constraints.  House price increases  appear to be associated with increases in the self-employment rate.    Most self-employed individuals in the UK work alone or in a partnership and do not have  any employees.  They typically work longer hours than their employed counterparts, but generally  earn less.  There is, however, no evidence that in aggregate increases in self-employment affect  growth in GDP, nor happiness, positively.  At the very top end the successful entrepreneur earns  considerably more than most wage and salary earners.  The entrepreneur has a unique skill – he or  she has created a job for him or herself and possibly even a job for others.  The entrepreneur is an  important engine for growth in the economy.   53Table 1.
