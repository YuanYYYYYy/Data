Patterns of Work Across the OECD    Speech given by  Guilia Faggio, Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics    Stephen Nickell, Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England and Centre for Economic  Performance, London School of Economics    30 May 2006        1    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspxAbstract  Market work per person of working age differs widely across the OECD countries and  there have been some significant changes in the last forty years. How to explain this  pattern? Taxes are part of the story but much remains to be explained. If we include all the  elements of the social security systems like early retirement benefits, sickness and  disability benefits and unemployment benefits, then we can capture some aspects of  the overall pattern but still a lot remains unexplained. The story favoured by Alesina et al.  (CEPR DP.5140, 2005) is that the nexus of strong unions, generous welfare and social  democracy implies both high taxes and pressure in favour of work-sharing in response to  adverse shocks. This story, however, falls foul of the simple fact that most Scandinavian  countries now do much more work than the French and Germans despite having stronger  unions, more generous welfare, higher taxes and more social democracy. Ultimately, we  are forced into the position that there is no simple story. Some of the broad patterns can  be explained but there remain country specific factors which are hard to identify but lead to  substantial differences from one country to another.

Introduction  In the early 1970s in France, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and the  United States (US), more or less the same proportion of the population of  working age were actually working (65-70 per cent).  And, on average,  they were working roughly the same number of hours per year (1850- 1950).  By contrast, in Sweden, more people were working (74 per cent)  but much shorter hours per year on average (around 1650 in 1973).  In  Italy, many fewer people were working (55 per cent) but about the same  average hours (1868 in 1970).    Three decades later some things have changed a lot, others very little.  In  France and Germany, average employment rates have fallen a little and  average hours per year have fallen dramatically to just over 1400 hours.   In the UK employment rates are much the same but average annual hours  have fallen slowly but steadily to below 1700 hours.  In the US, the  employment rate has risen a little and average annual hours have fallen a  little.  Interestingly, US employees now work more hours per year, on  average, than employees in any of the rich countries of the OECD1.  Little  has  also  changed  in  Sweden  over  the  last  thirty  years,  with  the  employment  rate  remaining  high  and  annual  hours  falling  only  very  slightly.  Italy also still has an exceptionally low employment rate but  annual hours here have fallen a fair bit (to around 1600) but not to the  levels reached in France and Germany.    Overall, as we shall see, the picture with regard to market work is quite  complicated.  Generally, the Scandinavians, along with the Dutch and  Swiss have the highest employment rates.  The Americans, Australians    1and Japanese work more hours per year than the rest.  The Southern  Europeans (and the Belgians) generally have the lowest employment rates  but not the lowest annual hours which may be found in Denmark, France,  Germany, the Netherlands and Norway.  Adding employment and hours  together, we find that Americans, Australians and New Zealanders are the  hardest workers, on average, and the French, Italians and Belgians work  least hard2.  The hardest working countries work about 40 per cent more  than the least hard working.    The fact that this number is so large has instigated a significant body of  research which has often focused on why, in particular, Americans work  so much harder than the average European.  An empirical overview may  be found in Nickell (1997) (Table 2 and Table 7, col. 3) and this suggests  that employment protection, taxes and unco-ordinated unions tend to be  associated with lower labour input.  On top of this, there is a great deal of  empirical  evidence  on  the  determinants  of  overall  employment  rates  including Nicoletti and Scarpetta (2002) and Nickell et al. (2003).  By  and large, they come to similar conclusions, namely that unions, taxes  and employment protection are associated with lower employment rates  but if union activity is co-ordinated, the impact of unions and taxes is  moderated.    Furthermore,  there  is  some  evidence  that  low  levels  of  competition in product markets is also associated with low employment  rates.    More recently, Prescott (2004) argued that taxes are the key, explaining  more or less all the variations in labour input across countries.  Davis and  Henrekson (2004) also emphasise the importance of taxes.  Both these  papers  echo  the  results  of  Daveri  and  Tabellini  (2000)  who  find  that  labour taxes can explain most of the fluctuations in unemployment in    2those countries which do not have co-ordinated pay bargaining.  This  strong emphasis on the role of labour taxes has been criticised on the  grounds that it is inconsistent with the bulk of the cross-country evidence,  basically  because  of  omitted  variable  bias  (Nickell,  2003),  or  on  the  grounds  that  it  is  inconsistent  with  the  evidence  on  labour  supply  elasticities (Alesina et al., 2005).    Alesina et al. (2005) then go on to note that labour inputs have fallen  especially in countries characterised by strong unions, extensive welfare,  high taxation and social democratic governments.  As they remark “The  bottom line is that hours worked fell in countries that can be characterised  by the Continental European model and did not fall in the countries with  the American model (with Britain and Ireland in between)” (p.23).  The  basic argument is that trade unions respond to adverse shocks by trying to  protect  employees,  pressing  for  work  sharing  as  well  as  employment  protection  more  generally,  which  tends  ultimately  to  reduce  overall  labour input.  This is reasonably plausible although the fact that Sweden,  the home of social democracy, strong unions and the welfare state, has  seen only very modest reductions in labour input over the last thirty years  gives  pause  for  thought.    Furthermore,  Australia,  where  over  80%  of  individuals still have their pay determined by union bargaining, has seen  little or no reduction in labour input.  By contrast, in the UK, where both  union  membership  and  coverage  have  collapsed  since  1980,  annual  working hours have fallen by 250 hours (14%) since 1973, whereas hours  in Sweden fell by a mere 79 over the same period.    In the light of this, it is perhaps worth pursuing the forces underlying  fluctuations in the volume of market work per capita a little further.  In  the next section, we look at the current overall picture and how it divides    3into annual hours and employment rates.  We then look at the history of  both these, emphasising the huge variations across the different countries.   In Section 3, we focus on changes in the participation rates of different  sub-groups of the population, notably, prime-age men and women as well  as older men.  We also consider overall unemployment rates.  In Section  4,  we  analyse  annual  working  hours,  trying  to  explain  the  large  differences in the changes since the early 1970s.  Finally, in Section 5, we  summarise  our  findings  and  provide  a  synthesis  of  the  various  explanations of changes in labour input over the last thirty years.    2.  The Overall Picture  In Table 1, we present a picture of labour input in 2002 in the richer  OECD countries, showing the division between employment rates and  hours.  The big three countries of Continental Europe (France, Germany,  Italy) plus Belgium has the lowest input levels and many of the “Anglo- Saxon” economies plus Japan have the highest input levels.  Denmark,  Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal and Finland tend towards the high input  end of the spectrum.  Turning to the division between employment rates  and annual hours, significantly more people work in Denmark, Norway,  Sweden and Switzerland than elsewhere.  The big countries of Southern  Europe,  Spain  and  Italy  have  many  fewer  people  in  work  than  the  remainder.  Looking at annual hours, we see from column 3, annual hours  tend to be high in the Anglo-Saxon economies and particularly low in the  Netherlands and Norway with France and Germany on the low side.    In Table 2, we divide annual hours into hours per week and weeks per  year.  An alternative picture, based on different data, may be found in the  Appendix.  Broadly speaking, the outcome is much the same although  there are large differences for one or two countries.  Hours per week vary    4relatively little across countries except for the Netherlands which has by  far the highest number of part-timers.  More interesting is weeks worked  per year, where there is much variation.  Weeks not worked generally  consist of either of holidays and vacations or of absences due to sickness  or maternity leave.  In practice, absences due to labour disputes, training  and  so  on  are  of  minor  significance.    Looking  first  at  vacations  and  holidays, what stands out is that these are between two and four weeks  lower in the US than in any of the other countries.  This is possibly due to  the differences in data sources, but it is also consistent with the fact that  many workers in the US only have one or two weeks paid vacation per  year,  which  would  be  illegal  in  nearly  all  OECD  countries.   Unfortunately, we do not have comparable data for other non-European  countries but we do know that Australian workers, for example, have a  legal minimum of 5.8 weeks holiday and vacation time each year (see  Table 15, below).    Other absences are a residual and consist mainly of sickness or maternity  leave.  There is a good deal of variation here which may, in part, be due  to measurement error.  The data in two tables in the Appendix present  some  alternative  numbers  which  again  show  significant  variations  in  sickness  and  maternity  leave.    These  we  investigate  further  below.   Overall, we see that annual holidays and vacations are much the same in  most countries with the notable exception of the United States.  On top of  this there are wide variations in weeks of other absence, mainly sickness  and maternity leave.    Some History  Having seen how labour inputs vary across countries, it is worth looking  at how employment rates and annual hours worked have changed over the    5last three or four decades.  Starting with employment rates, a striking  feature of the numbers in Table 3 is that in the early 1970s, the pattern of  employment rates across countries was much the same as it is today.  The  Scandinavian  countries  plus  Switzerland  have  always  had  the  highest  employment rates and still do.  Spain, Italy and Belgium have always had  the  lowest  employment  rates  and  still  do.    Some  countries  have  seen  significant  increases,  most  notably  the  Netherlands,  with  smaller  increases  in  Norway,  Canada,  New  Zealand  and  the  US.    In  every  country, the employment rate of women has risen, by anything from 10 to  35 percentage points.  Finland is the exception here, partly because it had  high rates of female participation even in the 1960s.  Typically, therefore,  the  employment  rates  of  men  have  declined  over  the  same  period.   Finally,  of  course,  these  employment  rates  have  been  affected  by  the  dramatic fluctuations in unemployment in the 1970s to the early 1990s.    Underlying this relatively stable pattern are some significant changes in  the employment rates of a variety of different sub-groups which we shall  pursue below.  Turning to the history of annual hours in Table 4, the  changes  over  the  last  three  or  four  decades  are  much  larger  than  the  changes in the employment rates.  In 1970, in nearly all countries for  which data are available, annual hours were typically between 1850 and  1950.  However, in Sweden and Norway, annual hours were already well  below  this  level  despite  a  very  buoyant  demand  for  labour,  with  unemployment  rates  in  the  two  countries  being  1.2  and  1.6  per  cent,  respectively.  By 2004, some countries had seen dramatic changes.  In  France, Germany and the Netherlands, annual hours fell by around 500  from 1970 to 2004, in Norway and Japan, the fall was around 400 and in  Ireland and the UK the fall was close to 300.  By contrast, in Sweden  Australia, Canada and the US, the fall over this same period was between    6100 and 150.  These differences are striking and we shall pursue them  further below.    In the next section we consider various components of the employment  rate.    3.  Aspects of the Employment Rate  First, we can see in Table 5, how employment and inactivity rates differ  across both men and women and different age groups.  We focus here on  the  over  25s  because  we  do  not  wish  to  pursue  questions  about  participation in education.    There are a number of interesting features of Table 5 which are worth  following up.  First, while the employment rates of prime age men (25- 54)  do  not  appear  to  vary  very  much,  there  are  some  quite  striking  differences in inactivity rates for this group.  Furthermore, the inactivity  rate  now  exceeds  the  unemployment  rate  in  nearly  every  country.   Second,  the  inactivity  rates  of  older  men  (55-64)  differ  significantly  across countries from Belgium, France, Italy and Austria where over half  of  older  men  are  inactive  to  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Japan  and  New  Zealand where less than one quarter are inactive.  Third, inactivity rates  among prime age women are over 30 per cent in Ireland, Italy, Spain and  Japan  and  around  15  per  cent  in  Scandinavia.    Interestingly  enough,  inactive women are not specifically looking after children.  Since the  1990s, the inactivity rates of women are inversely correlated with fertility  rates across countries.  So in what follows, we focus on each of these  three issues, starting with inactivity among prime age men.    Inactivity among prime age men    7The history of this aspect of labour input is set out in Table 6.  Back in  the  1960s  and  early  1970s,  prime  age  male  inactivity  rates  rarely  exceeded 5% by any significant amount.  By 2004, only two countries  have rates below 5%.  Countries where prime age men have inactivity  rates  exceeding  9%  today  include  Finland,  Norway,  Sweden,  UK,  Australia and the US.  This is an odd group of countries because, by and  large, they are noted for their relatively high levels of labour input.  Thus,  by contrast, France and Germany have particularly low levels of prime  age  male  inactivity  and  the  EU  average  is  only  7.6%.    The  evidence  which we have on this issue suggests that a significant proportion of these  inactive  men  are  categorised  as  long-term  sick  or  disabled  (European  Labour Force Survey).  Furthermore, we know that the rules governing  entry into the disability benefit system are crucial, because exit rates are  generally very low.  In some countries, these rules were significantly  weakened in the last thirty five years, in others not.  Thus in Bound and  Burkhauser (1999), Table 17 we find the following:    Disability transfer recipients per 100 workers  Age  15-44  45-59    1970  1995  1970  1995  US  1.1  3.9  3.3  10.3  Sweden  1.8  3.2  6.6  15.1  Germany (W)  0.7  0.6  7.5  8.7    So in the US and Sweden, the numbers more than double from 1970 to  1995 whereas in Germany they barely change.  In the UK, they rise even  faster (see Faggio and Nickell, 2003).    Inactivity among older men    8The history of inactivity among older men is presented in Table 7.  Back  in the early 1970s, these inactivity rates rarely exceeded 25% with the  notable exception of Italy.  The situation here was exceptional because at  that time Italian men were entitled to a generous public pension at age 60.   By the early 1990s, inactivity rates among older men exceeded 25% in all  countries  except  Japan  and  were  above  45%  in  many  Continental  European  countries  outside  Scandinavia.    Why  did  this  happen?   Basically,  much  of  this  change  can  be  explained  by  the  increase  in  financial incentives to retire early.  And, by and large, these incentives  were introduced to remove older workers from the labour force under the  mistaken belief that this reduction in effective labour supply would help  reduce  high  levels  of  unemployment.    For  example,  in  1979,  Italy  introduced “unemployment pensions” at age 57+, if unemployment was  due  to  severe  economic  conditions  or  industrial  reorganisation.    In  France,  unemployment  benefits  were  paid  to  those  over  56  with  no  requirements to seek work or retrain.    Blondal and Scarpetta (1998) present a detailed analysis of the incentive  issue and their panel data regressions reveal the importance of financial  incentives in determining early retirement.  In the 1995 column in Table  7, we present, in parentheses, the estimated inactivity rates were pension  systems to be made actuarially neutral up to age 64.  In many European  countries, this makes a substantial difference.  Duval (2003) extends this  work and in Table 8, we report the implicit tax rates on those working  between  55  and  64  generated  by  the  early  retirement  and  pension  systems.  Then, in Table 9, we show some of Duval’s regressions simply  to  illustrate  the  importance  of  implicit  tax  rates  in  determining  early  retirement.  For example, an implicit tax rate at age 60 of 50 per cent will  generate a fall in participation of 8.5 per cent.  In the parentheses after the    91999 column in Table 7, we show Duval’s estimates of the inactivity rate  were  early  retirement  schemes  to  be  removed  and  actuarial  neutrality  introduced up to 64.  Again, they show big effects for many countries  taking the inactivity rates back to 1970s levels.  Interestingly, by 2004,  we  can  see  that  inactivity  among  older  men  has  started  to  fall  in  a  significant number of countries, particularly those where early retirement  incentives  have  been  reduced,  notably  Finland,  Denmark  and  the  Netherlands.    Inactivity among prime age women  The overall picture is provided in Table 10 and this shows that there has  been a continuing fall in inactivity among prime age women in nearly  every country.  But inactivity rates are still high in Ireland, Italy, Japan  and Spain.  Indeed, far higher than in much of Scandinavia in the 1970s.   Furthermore,  whereas  in  the  1970s,  fertility  was  positively  correlated  with inactivity across OECD countries, it is now negatively correlated.   So in the low inactivity countries, women not only work more, they also  have more children.    Much micro-econometric work and the cross-country analysis in OECD  (1990), Chapter 6 and Jaumotte (2003) suggest that marginal tax rates  may be important here.  So in Table 11, we present the marginal rates  facing married women at zero hours and when they are earning 67% of  average  earnings  given  their  spouses  are  earning  100%  of  average  earnings.    Here,  we  see  some  significant  cross-country  variations,  particularly  at  zero  hours.    If,  by  some  mechanism  or  other,  married  women have their own tax allowance, their marginal rate at zero hours  will be zero.  At the other extreme, their earnings may simply be added to  their husband’s for tax purposes, so their marginal rate will be the same    10as  their  husband’s.    It  is  plain  that  high  marginal  rates  at  zero  hours  generate a strong disincentive to working a low number of hours per  week.  Even at more normal hours, however, there are large variations in  marginal rates across countries.    The implications of these and other variables may be found in the panel  regressions explaining participation in Table 12.  Marginal tax rates have  important  effects,  as  might  be  expected,  with  10  percentage  point  increases  in  both  the  rates  included  in  the  regression  reducing  participation  rates  by  around  3  percentage  points.    The  strictness  of  employment  protection  laws  on  regular  employment  has  a  significant  negative effect as does union density.  Introducing measures of business  sector labour productivity and male unemployment in column 2 has little  impact on the key variables noted above.  The negative impact of these  new  variables  is  not  easy  to  interpret  because  they  are  potentially  endogenous3.  They are only introduced because they have been included  in other work (eg. OECD, 1990, Table 6.3 and Jaumotte, 2003, Table 5)  and it is worth checking that they do not change the key results.  The  same  argument  applies  to  the  inclusion  of  variables  capturing  public  expenditure on children and parental leave.  These will also tend to be  endogenous but their inclusion has little impact on the marginal tax rate  and  employment  protection  effects.    The  impact  of  union  density  is,  however, eliminated.    Overall,  marginal  tax  rates  and  employment  protection  seem  to  have  relatively robust negative effects.  However, the time dummies in the  regression in column 1 reveal a background rise in female participation  by 14 percentage points and this is even bigger after we add in further  variables in column 3.  The implication of this is that there are further    11factors driving female participation which we are not able to capture.   Furthermore, looking at the trends in inactivity implicit in Table 10, it is  plain that there are large differences across countries.  For example, there  are very significant differences in apparent preferences about part-time  work.  This is important, because a willingness to work part-time clearly  helps in obtaining a job.  In Table 13, we show the percentage of these  who work part-time and the percentage of these who do so voluntarily.   Thus in Finland and Spain, few women work part-time despite married  women facing zero marginal tax rates at zero hours.  Furthermore, around  half of these do so “involuntarily”.  By contrast, in the Netherlands, more  than half the working women are part-timers and the vast majority of  them wish to be so.    In summary, we can identify certain variables such as marginal tax rates  and employment protection, which impact on the participation rates of  prime age women.  But explaining why the vast majority of prime age  women  in  Scandinavia  were  active  in  the  labour  market  by  the  early  1970s when only a small minority were economically active in Italy and  the Netherlands, and why the changes in subsequent decades differ so  much, is not easy on the basis of standard economic variables.  In all the  countries, there are a number of causally interacting trends among women  going at different speeds in different countries – rising education, falling  fertility,  rising  participation,  rising  expenditures  on  child  care,  rising  productivity, rising wages.  Sorting out these interactions remains to be  done.    Overall unemployment rates  Since  a  great  deal  is  known  about  the  subject  (see  Nickell,  2003  or  Nickell et al., 2005 for example), we comment only briefly on overall    12unemployment rates.  In Table 14, we show the overall trends.  The basic  picture  is  one  where  unemployment  rose  across  the  OECD  from  the  1960s to the early 1980s, peaking then or in the early 1990s before falling  back to 1970s levels in most countries or remaining stubbornly high in  some, notably the big four of continental Europe (France, Germany, Italy,  Spain).  In 2004, around half of the European countries in our list had  lower unemployment than the United States, thereby emphasising that  only  a  part  of  Europe  suffers  from  the  slightly  mythical  “European  unemployment problem”.    To avoid high levels of unemployment, the following policies seem to  work.    First,  a  social  security  system  which  concentrates  on  placing  individuals in jobs.  It is important that specific people in the employment  service  are  responsible  for  specific  workless  individuals.    Further,  employees of the employment service must be well trained and have the  correct incentives.  They can employ a mixture of carrots and sticks.  The  actual level of benefits is not particularly important.  Second, having the  right  sort  of  wage  determination  system.    If  there  is  a  high  level  of  collective  bargaining  coverage,  some  degree  of  co-ordination  of  bargaining is required.  High coverage alongside low union membership  as well as decentralised and adversarial bargaining typically results in  high unemployment.  Also helpful are relatively low labour taxes and the  absence  of  very  strict  employment  protection  legislation.    Finally,  a  deregulated service sector helps to sustain a buoyant labour market when,  inevitably, manufacturing employment is on a downward trend.    This  completes  our  discussion  of  the  important  factors  determining  employment  rates.    We  next  turn  to  hours  worked  per  year  by  the  employed.    134.  Annual Hours Worked by the Employed  Despite the huge variations in annual hours worked by the employed4  across the OECD, less is known about this than about employment rates.   As we have already seen in Table 4, except for Sweden and Norway  where female participation was very high, annual hours in 1970 were  between 1850 and 1950 in most countries for which data are available.   Since that time, annual hours have fallen by anything from 100 to 150 in  Sweden, Australia, Canada and the US to around 500 in France, Germany  and the Netherlands.      We have already noted that variations in annual hours are driven, in the  main, by holidays and paid vacations and by sickness and parental leave.   Looking over time, we see from Table 15 that in many countries there has  been a significant increase in the minimum annual paid leave governed by  legislation.  In both Italy and the UK, there was no legislation until the  late 1990s when the European Working Time Directive (November 1993)  was incorporated into national legislation.  By and large this made little  difference in practice because annual paid holiday typically exceeded four  weeks in Italy and even as far back as 1981, average annual weeks of  holiday for manual workers in the UK was 4.2 (see OECD, 1990, Table  6.1).  Perhaps the most noteworthy point is that the US is unique among  the developed OECD countries in having no legal minimum to annual  paid leave.    Another contributory factor to changes in annual hours is the incidence of  part-time  work.    This  is  not,  of  course,  an  explanation  of  changes  in  annual hours since it is merely one of the mechanisms by which the hours  which people choose to work are expressed.  In Table 16, we see the    14history of part-time employment.  In many countries, there has been an  increase in part-time employment, but it remains below 20 per cent in  most  countries.    The  UK,  Switzerland,  the  Netherlands,  Japan  and  Australia have a significant proportion of part-time employment, mainly  among women.  Southern Europe generally has the lowest level of part- time work.    Turning  to  sickness  and  maternity  leave,  in  Table  17  we  present  information  on  the  percentage  of  employees  in  receipt  of  publicly  provided sickness and maternity benefit.  Interestingly, in many countries  we see that this percentage has fallen from 1980 to 1999.  Then in Table  18, column 1, we convert this into average weeks of leave which we then  compare  with  some  other  measures.    These  are  reasonably  closely  correlated although the fact that the average weeks in receipt of benefits  exceeds the absence measure provided by Alesina et al. (2005) for the US  suggests  the  latter  is  understated.    Nevertheless,  there  are  significant  differences across countries in the amount of sickness/maternity absence  and, presumably, a significant proportion of those differentials is due to  the variations in the rules governing benefit payments.    So  legislation  on  paid  vacation  leave  and  sickness/maternity  benefits  obviously  has  some  impact  on  working  hours,  but  what  about  the  underlying forces at work, including those which drive the legislation?    In Table 19, we present some panel regressions.  Looking first at the tax  variables,  there  is  a  positive  impact  on  hours  from  the  marginal  rate  facing women on zero hours where their husband is working.  This is  consistent  with  the  fact  that  high  marginal  tax  rates  at  zero  hours  discourage low hours jobs.  By contrast, the marginal rate facing married    15women with working husbands earning two-thirds of the average wage  has a negative impact on hours as might be expected.  The same applies  to the average tax wedge.  However, the marginal tax rate facing a single  earner appears to have a small positive effect, although it is hardly robust.      Employment  protection  has,  if  anything,  a  negative  impact  on  hours,  perhaps reflecting the fact that impressing managers with long hours is  less of a requirement if jobs are secure5.  Despite this, union density  appears to have a robust positive impact on hours, consistent with the  results reported in Bowles and Park (2005), Table 1, Column I.  This is,  however, inconsistent with the emphasis placed on the idea that trade  unions encourage shorter working hours by Alesina et al. (2005).    The strong positive role of earnings dispersion also confirms the results  of Bowles and Park (2005).  In their view, this is strong evidence in  favour  of  the  “Veblen  hypothesis”.    The  idea  here,  espoused  in  The  Theory  of  the  Leisure  Class  by  Thorsten  Veblen  (1934),  is  that  households consume goods not only for their own sake but to impress  their neighbours.  This, of itself, will tend to raise working hours and if  earnings are more dispersed, additional work effort is required to make  the appropriate impression6.  An alternative hypothesis, put forward by  Bell and Freeman (2001), is that increased earnings dispersion induces  longer hours because it raises the incentives to work harder in order to get  promoted  and  move  up  the  earnings  rankings.    Whatever  the  driving  force, there does appear to be a strong effect of earnings dispersion on  working hours.    Earnings  dispersion  itself  is,  of  course,  influenced  by  labour  market  institutions, even when the dispersion of skills is taken into account.  For    16example, Nickell (2004) reports a simple cross-country regression which  finds that the 90/10 earnings ratio is significantly negatively influenced  by union coverage even when controlling for skill dispersion captured by  the dispersion of test scores reported in the International Adult Literacy  Survey  (OECD,  2000).    Koeniger  et  al.  (2004),  in  a  more  extensive  analysis, find that both trade union density and employment protection  tend to reduce earnings dispersion and hence hours.  This indirect effect  of union density via earnings dispersion is -0.167 which does not quite  offset the positive union density effect in column 2.    Overall,  therefore,  we  find  that  various  aspects  of  the  tax  system,  employment  protection  and  union  density  impact  on  working  hours.   Perhaps  the  only  surprising  result  is  that  union  density  is  positively  related  to  hours,  even  when  taking  account  of  its  negative  impact  on  earnings dispersion.    5.  Summary and Conclusions  The data we have been analysing are summarised in Table 20, where we  show  the  history  of  labour  input  in  the  OECD  countries.    Before  discussing various stories, it is worth remarking at the outset that simply  comparing the US with “Europe” is a hopeless strategy because European  labour markets are highly diverse.  A second point to bear in mind is that  large macroeconomic shocks have distorted the labour input series for  some  countries  in  some  periods.    Thus,  in  France,  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  Spain  and  the  UK,  there  were  particularly  adverse  macroeconomic shocks between 1973 and 1983.  The same applies to  Finland  and  Sweden  in  the  early  1990s.    By  contrast,  Ireland,  the  Netherlands and Spain were subject to strong favourable shocks in the  1990s.    17The  first  story  which  is  frequently  used  to  explain  cross-country  variations in labour input is based on labour taxes, a recent example being  Prescott (2004).  The evidence we possess indicates that taxes cannot be  the whole story.  The tax story is inconsistent with the tax effects on  labour inputs generated by microeconometric studies (Alesina et al. 2005)  and  those  generated  by  cross-country  studies  (Nickell,  2003).    For  example, if we apply the tax data to the annual hours regressions in Table  19, we find that the contribution of tax changes to the changes in annual  hours from the early 1980s to the late 1990s is very small, probably less  than 10 per cent.    A second story would be in the same spirit as the tax story but adding in  all  the  other  elements  of  the  social  security  system  including  early  retirement  benefits,  sickness  and  disability  benefits,  unemployment  benefits  and  so  on.    As  we  have  seen,  these  are  certainly  good  at  explaining  the  changes  in  some  aspects  of  the  labour  input,  notably  inactivity among men, both prime age and old, as well as a part of the  changes in unemployment and female participation.  But shifts in annual  working hours are a major part of the story and here, while labour taxes  have a significant impact, they explain only little of the overall picture.     A third story is that favoured by Alesina et al. (2005) who argue that the  nexus of strong unions, generous welfare benefits and social democratic  governments imply both high taxes and direct pressure towards less work.   This latter is partly driven by work-sharing in response to adverse shocks  and partly by the not unreasonable belief that long holidays are a good  thing for workers, hence laws governing minimum levels of paid annual  leave.  In practice, all developed OECD countries bar the US have such    18laws, even those such as New Zealand and the UK where unionisation  has  collapsed.    However,  the  work-sharing  story  applies  clearly  to  Germany  and  particularly  France,  where  incentives  to  reduce  labour  supply  have  consistently  been  applied  in  response  to  increases  in  unemployment,  culminating  in  the  imposition  of  the  35-hour  week  in  France in the late 1990s.    However, it is hard to see how the same story applies to Sweden which  has stronger unions, more generous welfare benefits, higher taxes and  more social democratic governments than either France or Germany.  Yet  it has one of the highest employment rates in the OECD and only a small  fall in labour input since the early 1970s.  Thus, overall labour input in  Sweden was 3% below that in France and Germany (average) in 1970 and  26% above in 2004.  Both Italy and the Netherlands also had only small  falls in labour input from 1973 to 2004, but for very different reasons.  In  both countries, labour input in 1973 was exceptionally low.  In Italy this  was because female participation was very low, with an employment rate  of around 30%.  Furthermore, the retirement age was 60 for men and 55  for  women,  at  least  five  years  younger  than  in  any  other  European  country.  For example, it was 67 for both men and women in Denmark  and Sweden.  So it is no surprise that in 1973 and, indeed, even in the  1960s, Italy had the lowest employment rate in the OECD.  And it still  does.  Add in only a modest fall in annual hours and we find only a small  fall in overall labour input.  There is no strong element of work-sharing  here.    Indeed,  the  Italian  labour  market  model,  with  minimal  welfare  benefits and very strong employment protection, places a great deal of  weight on the position of the male head of household, which is not to be  undermined  either by the presence of a high earning wife or by the loss    19of a job.  Thus the unemployment rate of husbands at 2% was, in 1992,  among the lowest in the OECD (see OECD, 1994, Table 1.19).  While the labour input in the Netherlands was also exceptionally low in  1973, the subsequent history is completely different.  The employment  rate of women in 1973 was extraordinarily low in the Netherlands at  28.6% but by 2004 it had risen to 65.7%.  As a consequence the overall  employment rate had risen by 17 percentage points, by far the largest  increase in the OECD.  But the majority of women in employment in the  Netherlands work part-time, so average annual hours fell dramatically.   The overall consequence of this was that the total labour input had barely  changed by 2004.    From all these different histories, it is clear that there is no simple story  which can explain what is going on.  If we take groups of apparently  similar countries, even then we find considerable within group variations.   For  example,  in  the  “Anglo-Saxon”  group,  Australia,  Canada,  New  Zealand, UK, US, all have a high level of labour input at present.  Yet  while Australia and Canada continue to have a strong union presence and  Canadian  labour  taxes  have  risen  significantly,  their  labour  input  has  risen  whereas,  in  the  UK,  union  membership  has  collapsed  since  the  1970s and labour taxes have not increased, yet labour input has fallen by  nearly 12% since 1973.  Compared to this group, the Scandinavian group  Denmark,  Finland,  Sweden  has,  and  always  has  had,  very  high  employment rates, very strong unions and very rapid increases in labour  taxes.  Yet their labour inputs have not fallen rapidly and are still only  around 10 per cent lower than in the Anglo-Saxon group.  By contrast,  the major countries of Continental Europe, France and Germany, where  unions  are  weaker  and  taxes  have  risen  less  rapidly,  work-sharing    20strategies  have  been  embraced  wholeheartedly  and  labour  inputs  have  fallen dramatically in the last thirty years.    The upshot of this is that there is no clear, simple story which will explain  the cross-country pattern of labour inputs over the last forty years.  The  incentives  embedded  in  the  tax  and  social  security  systems  of  the  different countries are clearly important and explain many features of the  pattern.  But they are far from being the whole story.  Trade unions, and  indeed the population at large, have embraced work-sharing strategies in  response to adverse shocks in France and Germany.  This has helped to  drive down annual working hours by around 500 since the early 1970s.   This  liking  for  work-sharing  strategies  is  not,  however,  shared  in  the  more  corporatist  societies  of  Denmark,  Sweden  and  Finland  perhaps  because they have a different view of how the economy works (see Saint- Paul, 2004).  Here the tax/legal framework is used to enhance work/life  balance, with very high labour force participation and relatively stable  annual hours, which have fallen little over the last thirty years despite  numerous adverse shocks.    Broadly  speaking,  we  can  discern  three  groups  of  countries,  Anglo- Saxon,  France/Germany,  Scandinavia  where  there  is  some  sort  of  coherent story to be told about their pattern of labour input and the role of  taxes, benefits, unions and other labour market institutions.  But further  countries, such as Italy and the Netherlands, do not fit into any of these  three groups, and different explanations of their labour input patterns are  required.  Overall, while it is plain that the tax/benefit system and unions  and other labour market institutions are important in explaining labour  input patterns across the OECD, other factors are involved which are not    21easy to identify but lead to substantial differences from one country to  another.      22Table 1  Hours per Working Age Person Per Week and its Components (2002)    1  2  3  Weekly hours worked per  Employment/  Annual hours  person of working age  Population of  actually worked  (2x3 ÷ 100)  working age (%)  by workers ÷ 52  Austria  20.5  68.2  30.1  Belgium  17.8  59.7  29.8  Denmark  21.5  76.4  28.1  Finland  22.5  67.7  33.2  France  17.5  62.2  28.1  Germany  18.2  65.3  27.8  Ireland  20.8  65.0  32.0  Italy  17.1  55.6  30.8  Netherlands  19.1  74.5  25.7  Norway  19.9  77.1  25.8  Portugal  22.2  68.1  32.6  Spain  20.8  59.5  34.9  Sweden  22.8  74.9  30.4  Switzerland  22.9  78.9  29.0  UK  23.6  72.7  32.5  Australia  24.3  69.2  35.1  Canada  23.8  71.5  33.3  Japan  23.6  68.2  34.6  NZ  25.3  72.4  34.9  US  24.9  71.9  34.6     Sources:    Employment/Population:  OECD Employment Outlook, 2004, Table B.

The exception here is Italy  where we use the US Bureau of Labour Statistics “unemployment rates on US concepts”.  In particular we use the correction to the OECD  standardised rates made by the Bureau prior to 1993.  This generates a rate which is 1.6 percentage points below the OECD standardised rate  after 1993.  The rates referred to in Spain* refer to recently revised ILO rates.  For earlier years we use the data reported in Layard et al. (1991)).   For later years we use the OECD Employment Outlook (2005, Table A).    38Table 15    Minimum Annual leave Legislation a      1964  1984  1992  2003c  Public  Holidays  (1991) (days)              Austria  2  4  5  5 (5)  13  Belgium  2  4  4  4  10-13.5  Denmark  3  5  5  5 (6)  10  Finland  3  4  5  4 (5)  5-9  France  3  5  5  5 (5)  11  Germany  2.5  3  3  4 (5.8)  11 + 4 regional  Ireland  2  3  3  4 (4)  8  Italy  0b  0b  0b  4 (5.6)  11  Netherlands  2.5  3  4  4 (6.2)  9  Norway  3  4.2  4.2  4.2 (5)  10  Portugal  1  3-4.4  3-4.4  4.4 (4.9)  13  Spain  1  5  5  4.2  13  Sweden  4  5  5.4  5 (6.6)  9  Switzerland  1  2  4  na  8  UK  0  0  0  4 (4.9)  8 + 3 regional  Australia  3  4  4  4  9  Canada  1  2  2  na  10  Japan  1  1  2  na  12  NZ  2  3  3  na  11  US  0  0  0  0  10    a.

In this table, the survey data on sickness and maternity are doubled.  This is an adjustment  suggested by OECD staff.  In our view, some of these numbers seem implausible.      46Footnotes    1.  Thus, they work more hours per year, on average, than workers in any other OECD country  aside from the Czech Republic, Greece, Mexico, Poland, the Slovak Republic (OECD, 2005,  Table F).  However US annual hours are of the same order of magnitude as those in  Australia and New Zealand.    2.  This, of course, refers only to market work. It is sometimes argued that a great deal of  market activity in some countries is replicated by non-market activities in others, partly for  tax reasons.  For example, far more time in Germany is spent on food preparation in the  home than in the US, where a far higher proportion of food expenditure is in restaurants (see  Freeman and Schettkat, 2001).  However, the data reported in Alesina et al. (2005), Table  17, indicates  that the Germans spend much less time in the home on child care and  housework than Americans and that they spend more or less equal amounts of time on  leisure activities.    3.  Labour productivity may be affected by changes in female participation, and unemployment  rates may easily be influenced by omitted factors which also affect participation.    4.  Annual hours refers to the hours worked in a year by workers who work for the whole year  (or full year equivalent workers).  They may work part-time, however.  Also, it refers to  hours actually worked, not hours paid for.    5.  Perhaps because, if jobs are secure, unauthorised absence is less likely to be punished by job  loss.    6.  Bowles and Park (2005) provide a formal model of this effect.    7.  In Koeniger (2004), Table 3, columns (5), (6), we find the coefficient on union density is - 0.32 in the 90/50 equation and -0.13 in the 50/10 equation.  So the total effect of union  density Table 19, column 2 is 0.21 – (0.32 x 0.22 + 0.13 x 0.70) = 0.21 – 0.16 = 0.05.                                47References    Alesina, A. F., Glaeser, E.
