The rate of UK population growth  did exceed that of six countries from the former Soviet bloc (Czech Republic; Croatia;  Estonia; Hungary; Latvia and Bulgaria), but was below the rates of growth of Poland,  Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia.    b) The UK population has grown at a faster pace since the turn of the millennium. This  recent growth has been driven primarily by changes in net migration.  Both the inflow  and outflow rates have risen, but the inflow rate has risen more rapidly recently, with an  influx of migrants from eight East European (A8) countries.  However, the increase in the  net migration flow predates the influx of A8 migrants, reflecting a steady rise in the  number of immigrants from Asia and the Middle East too.     c) The propensity to migrate to the UK is higher the lower is GDP per capita in each of  the A8 countries.  The decision is also strongly correlated with life satisfaction scores and  unemployment rates, but is uncorrelated with employment rates or rates of inflation.      d) There appears to be consistent evidence from the Worker Registration Scheme and  National Insurance Number applications that approximately 500,000 migrants from the  A8 countries had come to work in the UK between May 2004 and late 2006.  But other  sources suggest a significant proportion of these workers have likely returned to their  country of origin.      e) The empirical literature from around the world suggests little or no evidence that  immigrants have had a major impact on native labour market outcomes such as wages  and unemployment.  Recent work by a number of other authors for the UK is also  consistent with this view.    (f)  The impact of recent migration from the A8 countries on the UK economy will be  determined by the extent to which immigrants add to supply relative to demand, since it  is the balance between these two factors that determines prospects for inflation.  We  argue that, at present, it appears that A8 immigration has tended to increase supply by  more than it has increased demand in the UK (in the short run), and thereby acted to  reduce inflationary pressures.    (g)  There seems to be broad agreement that immigration is likely to have reduced the  natural rate of unemployment in the UK over the past few years.  But there is some  uncertainty about what has happened to the natural rate in the very recent past and what  might happen to it in the near future.  This is because immigration has not been the only  shock to affect the labour market very recently.1) Introduction    The recent rise in migration to the UK from eight EU Accession countries (the Czech  Republic; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Poland; Slovakia; and Slovenia – the A8  countries) has generated a good deal of controversy.  How many A8 immigrants are there  in the UK?  Where did they come from and when?  What impact has their influx had on  the UK economy and what likely impacts will they have in the future?  Most importantly  for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), what macroeconomic effects have they had?      We attempt to address these questions here.  First, we examine the change in population  in the UK over the last thirty-five years and note that growth is very low by international  standards.  The UK population has, however, grown at a faster pace since the turn of the  millennium, driven most recently by migration from the A8 nations.  It appears that the  propensity to migrate to the UK from these countries is higher the lower is GDP per  capita.  Second, we examine the various sources of data that are available on the numbers  of A8 immigrants that have arrived in the UK in recent years.  There is broad agreement  from the various data sources on the numbers involved – half a million workers is likely  to be an upper bound for the stock of A8 migrants who are in the UK in late 2006.  Many  of the new 'migrants' may have stayed for only a short time and then returned home, to  possibly return again at a later date.  Third, we examine the characteristics of the recent  flow of individuals from the A8 countries that have arrived in the UK since accession,  and find that they are relatively young, male, have low unemployment rates, lower wages,  and high self-employment rates and are especially likely to be in temporary jobs.  Finally,  we turn to the macroeconomic implications of A8 migration to the UK, and argue that  this immigration has made the labour market more flexible and likely lowered the natural  rate of unemployment and the NAIRU.     1) Population changes    According to official estimates published by the Office for National Statistics, the UK  population grew by just 8.2% between 1971 and 2006, from 55.9 million to 60.5 million.   In contrast, the United States population grew by 44.6% over the same period, from 207.7  million in 1971 to 300.3 million  in 2006.2   Indeed population growth across many  countries has been greater than in the UK over the past three decades (Chart 1).  Over the  period 1971-2004, population growth in the UK ranks 31st out of 38 European and other  large nations for which data are available (listed in Table 1, excluding Romania), with  only Germany (East and West) and six East European countries having had slower  population growth (Czech Republic; Croatia; Estonia; Hungary; Latvia and Bulgaria).   All the other major industrialised nations have had faster rates of population growth.   Growth was particularly rapid in the US (+42%) as noted above, but also in Australia  (+54%); Canada (+45%); Spain (+25%); Japan (+21%); and France (+18%).  The Indian  population roughly doubled over the same period (96%), while the Chinese population  grew  by  52%.    It  is  clear  that  UK  population  growth  has  been  extremely  low  by  international standards – it is even below that of Italy (+7.6%).                                                      2 Source: Statistical Abstract of the United States, 2001, 2006 and www.census.gov.    1Chart 1: Population growth, 1971-2004   Chart 2: Annual UK population growth,  based on official estimates of migration  Percentage change in population,  Percentage change on a year earlier 1971-2004 100 Births-Deaths 0.7 A8 net migration 0.6 80 Non-A8 net migration 0.5 Total population growth 60 0.4 40 0.3 0.2 20 0.1 0 0.0 -20 -0.1 India     AustraliaCanada   USA       Spain       Japan       France     UK          Bulgaria    1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 -0.2   Source:  Eurostat,  US  Statistical  Abstract  2006  and  Health  Source: ONS  Statistics Quarterly, 32, Winter 2006      1. Official disaggregated data are not yet available for 2006.   1. The chart shows the ordering of population growth between  1971 and 2004  of the 38 countries listed in Table 2.      Long-run trends, however, mask some significant short-run changes in population growth  (Chart 2 & Table 2a).  The UK population grew by 2.8 million (4.9%) between 1971 and  1999, but the population has subsequently risen by a further 1.8 million (3.2%).  The  main cause of this increase has been a rise in net inward migration, driven by an increase  in the inflow rate to the UK; the outflow rate has remained little changed over the years,  although there has been a pickup since 1998. The ratio of births to deaths has seen less  variation. In 2004-5 net migration accounted for two-thirds of the change in population  (248/375).  To place these numbers in some degree of context, net (legal) migration in the  United States accounted for approximately one third of net population growth in 2004- 2005.3  Table 2b makes it clear that the scale of net inward migration to the UK has been  much lower than in most other EU countries until recently, and even now remains below  the levels of both Italy and Spain.   In summary, UK population growth appears to have been extremely low by international  standards over the past three decades.  As such, it would seem likely that the UK could  absorb a relatively small inflow of immigrants, by international standards.  As we note  below, it appears that it has already done so to a considerable degree; the entry of recent  A8 migrants appears to have improved the workings of the labour market, reduced wage  and inflationary pressures and lowered the natural rate of unemployment.                                                           3 Population in the United States on July 1st 2004 was 293,657,000 increasing to 296,410,000 on July 1st  2005 a net increase of 2,754,000 or 0.94%.  This increase was made up of 4,129,000 births, 2,425,000  deaths and net legal migration of 1,050,000.

The increase in net migration coincides with changes in UK immigration policy and the  relative  attractiveness  of  the  UK’s  economic  position  over  the  past  decade.    Most  recently, the increase in the inflow rate of migrants appears in large part to be attributable  to immigration policy that accompanied the accession of the A8 countries on May 1st  2004;4 citizens from the A8 nations obtained free movement and the right to work in the  UK, Ireland and Sweden from this date.5  But there has continued to be a steady growth  in the inflow of migrants to the UK from non-A8 countries too, especially from the New  Commonwealth.    The literature on immigration focuses on the economic factors that determine migration.   Very simply, the literature says that individuals will compare the income benefits from  migration with the economic and social costs of moving.  If the benefits outweigh the  costs, they may choose to migrate.  The gain from moving will be calculated as the  expected income differential between the destination country and the country of origin,  which will in turn be determined by the relative probability of getting a job – captured by  differences in the unemployment or employment rates.      Naskoteen and Zimmer (1980) find for the US that a 10 percentage point increase in the  wage differential between the countries of destination and origin increases the probability  of migration by 7 percentage points.  Borjas (2005) finds that a 10 percentage point  increase in the rate of employment growth in the state of origin reduces the probability of  migration by approximately 2 percent.  There is also evidence that migration is most  common among younger and more educated workers (Borjas 2005).  Moreover, workers  who have just migrated are extremely likely to move back to their original locations.  The  probability of a migrant returning to the state of origin within a year is about 13 per cent  and the probability of moving to another location is 15 per cent (Devanzo, 1983 and  Dustmann, 2003). Zaiceva (2006) summarises the empirical literature on the potential  migration flows, which he shows to be consistent with between 2 and 4 per cent of the  residents of Central and East European countries (CEECS) moving West, in the long run,  which constitutes around 1 per cent of the EU15 population.   Zaiceva also presents  evidence from simulations suggesting that the majority of migrants are predicted to come  from Romania, Poland and Bulgaria, which is consistent with other estimates from the  literature.    Gilpin et al (2006) examine whether A8 citizens have come to the UK because it offers a  higher standard of living (GDP per capita) or a higher probability of getting a  job  (measured by the inverse of the unemployment rate), or both.  They consider data from  the Worker Registration Scheme (see Appendix A for more details on this data source).                                                     4 In addition Malta and (South) Cyprus also joined the EU at that date.  Bulgaria and Romania joined the  EU on January 1st 2007.    5 Finland, Greece, Portugal and Spain opened their labour markets to these workers on May 1st 2006, while  Italy followed in late July 2006.  Five other countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and  Luxembourg) alleviated restrictions in 2006 (Zaiceva, 2006).    3They compute the number of WRS registrations as a percentage of the home country  population and show it is correlated with GDP and unemployment.  We update their  analysis in Table A. It is apparent that a larger fraction of people of Lithuania (1.60%);  Latvia (1.25%); Slovakia (0.92%) and Poland (0.79%) have come to the UK compared to  Estonia (0.42%), the Czech Republic (0.24), Hungary (0.14) and Slovenia (0.02) (Table  A).  Gilpin et al. find that countries with the lowest GDP per head, such as Lithuania  (2500 Euros) are more likely to be registered on the UK WRS than those from countries  with higher GDP, such as Slovenia (11,400 Euros).6  Workers in the WRS data are also  more likely to come from countries with the highest unemployment rates, such as Poland  (19.0%).    Pedersen  et  al  (2004)  found  similar  effects  for  GDP  per  capita  and  the  unemployment rate in both source and destination countries in their study of migration  flows into OECD countries in the 1990s.

The correlation is slightly weaker  with  the  unemployment  rate,  but  especially  low  with  the  employment  rate.7    Interestingly, Schiopu and Siegfried (2006) found that the difference in GDP between the  host and home countries increases the size of remittances.    Data are also available on the country’s rank on the 2005 Human Development Index  taken from the Human Development Report of the UN, and their average life satisfaction                                                    6 Expressed as Euros per inhabitant at 1995 exchange rates and prices.    7 The correlation with the CPI is only -0.166, also drawn from the HDR 2006, Table 14.    4score for 2002 taken from the Eurobarometer Surveys.8  A lower rank on HDI is better, a  higher life satisfaction score is better.

It is already well-known that East Europeans are  more likely to report that they are unhappy (Blanchflower, 2000 and Blanchflower and  Freeman 1999).  In a recent Candidate Eurobarometer collected between September and  October, 2002 (ICPSR #4062) respondents were asked the following question.     Q.  On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied or not at all  satisfied with the life you lead? A. Very satisfied=4; Fairly satisfied=3; Not very  satisfied=2; Not at all satisfied=1                                                      8 The HDI is published annually by the United Nations and is a score that amalgamates three indicators:  lifespan; educational attainment and adjusted real income (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2005).    9 The correlation is similar with the 2001 life satisfaction score (-0.72), but lower in 2003 (-0.55), 2004 (- 0.57) and 2005 (-0.58)  5The  means  of  the  life  satisfaction  score variable  correlate  reasonably well with  the  propensity  to  migrate  (r=-0.751)  and  considerably  better  than  the  unemployment  or  employment rates.      In  summary,  the  favourable  macroeconomic  climate  (low  unemployment)  and  high  standard of living in the UK (GDP per capita) are reasons why immigrants from the A8  countries may have been attracted to the UK, and why immigrants from Bulgaria and  Romania may be attracted in the future.  The OECD has recently (2006b) projected that  GDP will grow particularly quickly in both Poland and Slovakia over the next couple of  years.  The OECD projects a growth rate of around 8% in both 2006 and 2007 in  Slovakia, and 5% in Poland, where, it suggests remittances from migrants will sustain  consumption. The other member of the OECD is Hungary, which is projected to grow at  4% in 2006, but only at 2% in 2007. Rapid GDP growth in some A8 countries and  improvements in their unemployment rates might suggest a reduction in the flows of both  permanent migrants and especially temporary workers to the UK from the A8 countries in  the near future.  Pedersen et al (2004) studied migration flows into 27 OECD countries  from 1990-2000 and found that network effects, measured as the coefficient of the stock  of immigrants of own national background already resident in a country, had a large  positive impact on immigration flows.  This suggests that rather than dissipate, the flows  may well continue well into the future although the scale of the flow remains uncertain.   Further  the  Bank’s  regional  Agents  have  undertaken  a  survey  of  business  contacts  concerning their use of migrant labour that suggested that a majority of firms were  expecting to make greater use of such labour into the future.    3) Size of migration flows from the A8    It is difficult to get an exact estimate of the size of the flows of individuals from the A8  countries to the UK since accession.  Some estimates suggest that around 500,000 A8  workers have come to the UK, but other sources suggest many fewer. It is also unclear  what proportion of such workers are long-term migrants and what proportion are here for  a short time and have  subsequently returned home, perhaps to return again in the future.   The scale and nature of this flow is an important question for policy makers because it  affects the labour market and the wider economy.  It is therefore important to try and  understand and reconcile the differences between different data sources as far as possible.   Doing this, we find that 500,000 workers is an upper bound for the stock of post- accession A8 workers in the UK in late 2006.      There are four main sources of data on the flow of A8 individuals.  Further details of the  sources are provided in Appendix A.  We examine estimates of the numbers using each  data series in turn.    1) Worker Registration Scheme  Table  3  reports  the  number  of  workers,  by  A8  country,  who  registered,  and  were  approved for work, on the WRS – a registration scheme for employees from the A8  countries.  The self-employed do not need to register under the WRS.  The largest  number in every year has come  from  Poland.    Between  2004Q2  and 2006Q3  over  300,000 Poles had registered, which constitutes 63% of the total.  The next largest group  (11%) is from Lithuania, which had only 3.4 million residents in 2004, compared with  638.2 million in Poland.10  The flows by quarter are very similar.  The WRS suggests that  486,660 workers had registered to work in the UK since accession – a further 3,895 were  refused, 1,035 were exempt and 14,950 applications were withdrawn making a grand  total of 510,340 applicants.  The three main countries from which migrants have come  are Poland (63%); Lithuania (11%); and Slovakia (10%).    Ireland has been the other major recipient of migrant flows from the A8.  According to  Ireland’s National Training and Employment Authority (FÁS), over the first twelve  months to April 2005, 83,000 Personal Public Service Numbers (PPSN) were issued to  EU10 nationals, which is equivalent to almost 4% of Ireland’s labour force. Some of  these people were, however, already in Ireland prior to May 2004. Another 66,000 PPSNs  were issued in the six months from May to October 2005, an increase of 46% on the same  period for the previous year.  The OECD (2006a) suggests that the country composition  of A8 workers to Ireland is similar to that of the UK - Poland (54%), Lithuania (19%),  Latvia (9%), and Slovakia (8%).11      2) Total International Migration, predominantly from the International Passenger Survey   Table 4 provides official estimates of migration based on the International Passenger  Survey (IPS), showing changes in the inflow and outflow rates of 'long-term international  migrants' – a migrant is someone who changes his or her country of usual residence for at  least 12 months.12  It is apparent that both have risen steadily since 2002, although the  inflow rate has experienced the more rapid rise. Table 4 suggests that there was a net  positive migration flow of 223,000 in 2004 and a further 185,000 in 2005, making a total  of 408,000.   As part of these, the IPS suggests that 132,000 individuals have come to the  UK from the A8 countries, which is a considerably lower number than from the WRS,  why?       Some concerns have been expressed about the accuracy of the data from this source as it  covers only the principal air and sea routes, and the Channel Tunnel.  There is evidence  of an increase in the number of passenger journeys terminating at airports not routinely  covered by the IPS – ie to terminals outside of Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester –  particularly to and from Poland (having increased from 516,000 in 2003 to 1,845,000 in  2005) – so some migrants may have been missed.13,14  Furthermore, many of these extra  journeys appear to have resulted from an increase in short-term visits to the UK – those  of less than three months.  Table C shows that there has been a steady increase in the                                                    10 Source: Eurostat.    11 OECD (2006, Table 1.22) suggests that the other major recipient countries other than Ireland and the UK  have been Italy (84,000); Norway (36,000) and the USA (21,000).    12 This is the UN-recommended definition of a migrant.  See ONS (2006a).    13 See www.caa.co.uk for airline statistics on passenger journeys in and out of the UK.    14 There have also been notable increases in the number of passenger journeys to and from Slovakia (from  29,000 to 284,000) and to and from Latvia (from 61,000 to 309,000), again with the vast majority of the  increases being to airports other than Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester, not routinely covered by the IPS.      7number of travellers from the A8 to the UK, consistent with the flights data.15  According  to the ONS, 89% of A8 travellers who came to the UK in 2006, said they intended to stay  less than 3 months.16  The exclusion of these short-term visitors from the count of 'long- term international migrants' may account for the lower estimate of the number of A8  migrants in the IPS than observed in the WRS.    Table C: Visits to the United Kingdom    (000s) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 EU25 13,463 14,113 15,953 17,159 18,299 EU15 12,837 13,346 14,522 14,945 15,231 A8 549 677 1,334 2,104 2,961 Poland 210 278 646 1,153 1,721   Source: Office for National Statistics    3) National Insurance Numbers (NINos)  Table 5 shows that there has been a sharp rise in the number of A8 individuals that have  requested  National  Insurance  numbers  –  up  from  12,000  in  2002/03  to  270,000  in  2005/06.17  Between April 2004 and March 2006, approximately 380,000 individuals  from the A8 countries had registered for a National Insurance number.  This estimate is  more similar to the WRS than the IPS, and the difference appears to reflect the different  time period covered and the inclusion of self-employed workers in the NINo data.      4) Labour Force Survey  It is feasible to obtain estimates of the number of A8 migrants resident in the UK using  population  weighted  LFS  micro-data.    To  the  extent  that  these  population  weights  undercount the number of migrants then this would be a source of bias.  Results are  reported in Table D.

Column 1 replicates the numbers in Gilpin et al                                                    15 www.statistics.gov/downloads/theme_transport/Visits_to_UK_Sep06.pdf     16  Although intentions may not equate to actual outcomes.      17 Source: DWP (2006)    8(2006) for the years 2003-2005 and updates them to 2006 based on Summer quarters in  each year (June, July and August).  Data for 2006Q3 (July, August, and September) are  also presented.  Around 350,000 nationals from the A8 countries were resident in the UK  by the Summer of 2006, according to the LFS data, of whom 240,000 had arrived since  2004; nearly 85% were workers (220,000).  Over time the proportion of A8 migrants who  are workers has risen from 36% to 74%.  Somewhat surprisingly, there has been little  change in the number who claim to be self-employed since 2004.  The LFS data also  suggest that 20% of all migrants that arrived in the UK between 2004 and 2006Q3 were  Polish, and roughly a third were from the A8 as a whole.      Reconciling the differences    The number of A8 migrants entering the UK since Accession appears quite uncertain  given the available data.  But the different sources vary in their coverage, both in terms of  the migrants captured (including definitional differences) and the period of observation.   Table E attempts to accommodate the latter issue, adjusting the NINo and TIM (IPS)  numbers such that they – like the LFS and WRS data – also cover the period since  Accession.  Following adjustment, the number of NINo applications and number of WRS  applicants are comparable at around 500,000.  The LFS and TIM (IPS) data are much  lower than these, but again comparable with one another.  The remaining differences  between the estimates reflect the groups of individuals covered and definitions employed.   The LFS and TIM data are designed to capture only those migrants who stay in the  country for an extended period of time – more than 6 months for the LFS and 12 months  for the IPS.  In contrast, the NINo and WRS capture all migrants, including those that  might return home relatively quickly – or in some sense commute to the UK for work.     The broader ordering of the estimates also makes sense.  The LFS micro-data suggest that  30,000 self-employed workers have come to the UK since Accession.  This equates to the  gap between the adjusted number of NINo applications, which covers all workers, and  the number of WRS applicants, which are solely employees.  In addition, we should also  expect the estimated number of A8 migrants from the LFS data to exceed the estimate  from the TIM(IPS), because the TIM(IPS) employs a more restrictive definition of a  migrant – a migrant is someone who changes his or her country of usual residence for a  period of at least a year.     Having reconciled the differences as far as possible, it appears that 500,000 workers is  likely to be an upper estimate of the number of A8 migrants that could potentially be in  the UK in late 2006.  The data also suggest that as many as half of the migrants that have  come to the UK have not stayed permanently.                        9Table E: Estimated number of immigrant arrivals since A8 Accession  Adjusted data  Period  to cover period  Available data Coverage covered  since Accession Those registering for  Apr. 2004 -  NINo registrations 382,100 tax or benefit purposes Mar. 2006 515,000 May 2004 -  WRS 486,660 Employed workers Sept. 2006 486,660 May 2004 -  LFS 265,000 All those aged 16-64 Sept. 2006 265,000 Jan. 2004 -   TIM (based on IPS) 132,000 All long-term migrants Dec. 2005 215,000     Source: DWP, Home Office, ONS and own estimates    1. The LFS numbers are different from those described earlier because they cover a different period and different group (those aged  16-64 versus 16+) of migrants.           It does seem that the extent of mis-measurement of the number of foreign workers from  the A8 is unlikely to have had any significant impact on the current measurement of the  ILO unemployment rate, or the claimant count, as the numbers of additional migrants  required to lower the unemployment rate by even 0.1% would involve impossibly large  numbers.18     There is another source of data on international migration that supports our findings.   Population  data  recently  available  from  Eurostat  (2006)  suggest  that  there  was  no  substantial decline in the populations of any of the A8 countries, especially Poland,  between 2004 and 2005.  As a proportion of the population, the greatest net outflows  have been from Lithuania (-0.60%) and Latvia (-0.55%).  This is consistent with the  flows to the UK from the A8 being largely temporary in nature.  The small emigration  numbers for the earliest period following accession are also consistent with that view,  presented in Table F.                                                                   18 Currently at the time of writing (December, 2006) there are 30,696,000 economically active and  1,711,000 unemployed giving an unemployment rate of 1,711/30,696=5.57%.  For simplicity, let us assume  that there were actually 304,000 more, uncounted, employed migrants, without adding anything to the  unemployment numbers as few if any of them are unemployed anyway.  Such an increase would only lower  the unemployment rate to (1,711/31,000)=5.52%.  It seems implausible to believe that there is greater mis- measurement than this.  To return the unemployment rate to its October 2005 level of 5.12% (1,554/30,312)  would require an increase in the workforce to 33,400,000, an increase of around three quarters of a million  uncounted workers, which seems unlikely.    10Table F: Other sources of data on migration flows     2004 2005 # change % change Emigration (000s) (000s) (000s) 2004 (000s) EU-25 457,189 459,488 2,299 0.50%  n/a EU-15 383,047 385,383 2,336 0.61%  n/a Czech Republic 10,212 10,221 9 0.09% 34.8 Estonia 1,351 1,347 -4 -0.30% n/a Hungary 10,117 10,098 -9 -0.01% 3.1 Latvia 2,319 2,306 -13 -0.55% 2.7 Lithuania 3,446 3,425 -21 -0.60% 15.2 Poland    . 38,191 38,174 -17 -0.04% 18.9 Slovenia 1,996 1,998 1 0.06% Slovakia 5,380 5,385 5 0.09% 8.3 Bulgaria 7,801 7,761 -40 -0.52% 1.6 Croatia 4,442 4,444 2 0.05%   n/a Romania 21,711 21,659 -53 -0.24%   n/a UK 59,700 60,035 335 0.56% 310.4   Source: Eurostat (Tables C.1 & F.3)    4) Characteristics of new migrants    It  is  possible  to  use  the  various  data  sources  described  above  to  determine  the  characteristics of new (defined here as post-2004, and used interchangeably with ‘recent’)  A8 migrants and how they compare with new migrants from non-A8 countries, older  migrants who arrived pre-2004, as well as the non-migrant population or natives.    a) Region  Table 6 shows the number of worker applications from the WRS that were approved by  region, with the largest numbers in the East of England followed by London.  Also  included in the final column of the table is the regional distribution of the unemployment  increase  of  263,000  that  occurred  over  the  twelve  months  to  September  2006.  The  correlation  between  the  distribution  of  migrants  and  growth  in  unemployment  is  relatively weak.    Table 7 shows the distribution of all migrants by region using data on National Insurance  numbers.  The table presents numbers registering in 2002-03 and 2005-06 as well as the  overall distribution of the migrants themselves alongside the distribution of the 16+  population.  The next to last column reports the number of migrants registering in 2005- 06 as a proportion of the 16+ population in 2006Q2.  As was the case with the WRS, the  distribution of migrants is only weakly related to the change in unemployment observed  over the last year and reported in the final column of the table.   It is apparent that  registrations of new migrants have increased in all regions, although the numbers are  especially high in London and the South East.  London and the South East account for  approximately 48% of registrations for National Insurance numbers, but only 26% of the  1116+ population.  Table 8a uses regression estimation techniques and the LFS micro-data  to confirm the importance of migrants in London and the South East.     It appears that the effects of A8 immigration would likely be felt most in the South East  and least in the rest of the country.  The question down the road is whether future waves  of immigrants will move outside London, to areas, such as Scotland, which have lower  unemployment and a declining and aging population.19      b) Occupation  Table 9 reports the distribution of A8 migrants by the top twenty occupations over time  from the WRS.  The largest occupation is Process operative (Other Factory Worker).  As  noted by Saleheen and Shadforth (2006), the dominant occupations are less skilled.   Interestingly,  though,  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  the  proportion  of  A8  workers in the WRS classified as being in Administration, Business and Management.   The majority of workers in the Administration, Business & Management occupation  group work for recruitment agencies and could be employed in a variety of occupations,  and on a temporary basis.  In 2004 (May-December), 24.8% of registered workers were  in this category, compared with 36.3% in 2005 and 34.8% in the first three quarters of  2006.  Consistent with this finding, Table 8b suggests that approximately one in five new  A8 immigrants are in temporary jobs.      c) Industry  From Table 8b it is apparent that the A8 migrants are more likely to be migrants in  Manufacturing,  Distribution,  Hotels  and  Restaurants  and  Construction  than  non-A8  migrants or natives.  Non-A8 migrants are more likely to be in the public sector –  especially as nurses and carers - confirmed by work permits data (Table 10).    d) Schooling  Table 8a suggests that a high proportion of the new A8 migrants have a qualification,  confirming the findings in Saleheen and Shadforth (2006).  The LFS classifies foreign  qualifications simply as ‘other’, so the level of these qualifications remains unclear.    e) Age and gender  The proportion of workers who register on the WRS who are young is particularly high  and  has  changed  little  over  time.    Of  those  who  applied  between  May  2004  and  September 2006, 82% were aged 18-34 and 43% were aged 18-24.   The male: female  ratio  was  58:42.    Confirming  the  evidence  in  the  WRS  that  A8  migrants  are  disproportionately young and male, 36.3% of applicants for NINos were aged 18-24 in  2005/6, and 44.9% were aged 25-34.  The male: female ratio was 54:46. Saleheen and  Shadforth (2006) found from the 2005 LFS that recent A8 immigrants are also younger,  more likely to be male and single than other recent immigrants or than the indigenous  population.  Drinkwater et al (2006) found similar results.  This is confirmed in the more  recent data used here which pools 2004-2006Q3 to ensure larger sample sizes.  A8  immigrants were on average 28 years of age compared with 30 years for recent non-A8                                                    19 See Bell and Blanchflower (2007)    12immigrants (Table 8a).  They were also disproportionately male (59.1% for A8s and  48.4% non-A8s) and single (54.2% for A8s and 51.4% for non-A8s).      These data fit with other information available from a Candidate Eurobarometer Survey  conducted by the European Commission in April 2001, which considered the migration  intentions of A10 (A8 plus Cyprus and Malta) residents well before the borders opened in  May 2004.  Respondents in the A10, plus Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, were asked “do  you intend to go and live and work – for a few months or several years – in a current EU  country in the next five years?”.20  Obviously, one cannot assume that everyone who  expresses an interest in migration will actually migrate, but it turns out that there are  patterns in the data consistent with the actual flows to the UK.  Table 11 reports the  results of estimating the probability of an individual responding in the affirmative to the  above question.21  Column 1 includes controls for age, gender, schooling, labour market  status and marital status and country dummies, with the excluded country being Malta.   Probabilities of ‘intending to move’ were especially high in Lithuania and Poland, which,  as we noted above, have been the two main source countries of A8 workers to the UK.   Column 1 suggests that intentions to move were higher for men, the young, the most  educated, unmarried or divorced, the unemployed, students and professionals.      Respondents in the survey were also asked “how willing would you be to live in another  European country where the language is different from your mother tongue?”  Possible  answers were ‘not at all; not much; to some extent; very much’.  Column 2 reports the  results of estimating an ordered logit where the dependent variable is set to one if not at  all, 2=not much etc. with the same controls as in column 1.  The patterns revealed in  column 2 are very similar to those in column 1 – the probability of being willing to move  is  higher  among  the  young;  men;  the  unmarried  and  divorced;  the  most  educated;  professionals and business proprietors; those from  Latvia and Poland, but also now  Slovakia.  These equations seem highly consistent with the characteristics of the migrants  outlined above – intentions appear to be highly correlated with subsequent actions.    Interestingly, the World Bank (2007) addressed the issue of the mobility of the young in  its  recent  World  Development  Report.    They  found  that  the  propensity  to  migrate  increases  over  the  teenage  years  peaking  in  the  early  twenties  in  many  destination  countries, such as Spain and the United States.  Hence, young people make up a higher  proportion of the flow of international migrants than the stock. Young people are likely to  face lower costs of moving and have higher lifetime returns.  The World Bank notes that  when  the  only  legal  options  for  the  young  are  through  high-skilled  immigration,  categories requiring tertiary education or substantial job experience, migrants are less  likely  to be young.    They  also  conducted  a  survey of  youths  aged 15-24  in  seven  developing  countries  (Albania,  Bangladesh,  Ethiopia,  Iraq,  Malaysia,  Romania  and                                                    20 Candidate Countries Eurobarometer #2002.1 March-April 2002 ZA No. 4153.

For  example, LaLonde and Topel (1997) found that 4.8 million of the 15.7 million US  immigrants  who  arrived  between  1907  and  1957  had  departed  by  the  latter  year.   Chiswick and Hatton (2003) pointed out that return migration exceeded immigration to  the United States during the 1930s.  Yang (2006) recently examined the economics of  return migration for temporary labour migration by Filipinos.  Yang found that, on  average, a 10% improvement in the exchange rate reduced the 12-month migrant return  rate by 1.4 percentage points. This is a large effect, amounting to nearly one-fifth of the  mean 12-month return rate in his sample.                                                       22  We thank David McKenzie at the World Bank for providing us with these data.    23 In both Romania and Albania over 90% of males expressed a desire to move, but only around 20% of the  total said they wanted to move permanently.      14f) Unemployment  There is little or no evidence to suggest that that the new A8 migrants have come to the  UK  to  claim  or  receive  benefits:  they  have  come  to  work.    A8  workers,  who  are  registered under the WRS, have a right to reside and are entitled to in-work benefits such  as housing benefit and council tax benefit.  If they are in part-time work of less than 15  hours per week they can qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance.  If they lose their job they  lose their worker status, but are able to remain in the UK to find another job.  However,  they do not have access to the benefit system, although after 12 months of continuous  employment they can have access to the full range of benefits.  Once someone has been  working for 12 months they can apply for a residence permit.  The immigrants from the  A8 have generally not brought dependents with them, although 56,681 successful claims  for child benefit have been filed. By 2006Q3, only 353/2328 applications for income  support;  859/5154  applications  for  income  based  jobseekers  allowance;  32/125  applications for state pension credit and 524 applications for homelessness assistance had  been allowed to proceed.  There have only been 128 local authority lettings to A8  immigrants in England.24  However, there is some anecdotal evidence, particularly in  London, that A8  migrants presenting as homeless has become a significant problem.    As Hillier and Hayes note:     "(I)t is unlikely that large numbers of A8 citizens will uproot themselves  from their homes, come to the UK to work for at least a year in order to  secure a future life of state-funded living.  First, there is the effort involved  in this, and we are presumably talking about people who are not prepared to  make much effort on most fronts.  Second, there is the standard of living  involved.  Would life on state benefits in the UK really be that much better  than life on a low income in Estonia?  Well, it might be.  But probably not  by enough to make it a worthwhile option for an otherwise idle person if  they had to work for at least  a year –  perhaps working  on a farm on  minimum wages – to get it" (2006, p.13).    As we show below, the influx of workers from the A8 appears to have had little or no  discernible effect on the unemployment rate or any other labour market aggregate for that  matter.  It is plausible of course, that an influx of immigrants could displace natives or  less recent immigrants, and this is an issue we discuss further below.  The large literature  on the issue suggests that this is unlikely to have been very important.    That being said, LFS data in Table 8b suggests that the unemployment rates for recent A8  immigrants are higher than for natives.  For example, the native unemployment rate for  men is 5.1%, compared with 6.8% for recent A8 migrants and is even higher for recent  non-A8 migrants.  The story is similar for females.  As we will show below, the higher  unemployment rates for A8 migrants arise in large part because of differences in age,  which need to be controlled for.                                                       24 Source: Home Office (2006).    15Table  12  reports  the  results  of  estimating  the  probability  of  a  randomly  selected  individual being unemployed, conditional on their characteristics, where the dependent  variable is set to zero if employed and one if unemployed, using data from the LFS.  A  dprobit is estimated as previously.21  The data used in the first three columns is for 2004- 2006Q3, while the final column is for 2000-2003, and for both year groupings the sample  is restricted to those of working age (16-64).  In columns 1-3 an immigration dummy is  included along with two dummies to identify recent A8 and recent non-A8 immigrants,  where 'recent' means post-2004.  Two year dummies are also included.  The result from  Table  8  is  replicated  here;  recent  immigrants  have  higher  probabilities  of  being  unemployed than natives or immigrants that arrived pre-2004. Adding five age dummies  in column 2 changes the sign of the A8 since 2004 dummy, and the coefficient is  significant at conventional levels.  The 'other since 2004' dummy and the immigration  dummies remain significant and positive.     The  main  reason  for  the  higher  observed  rates  of  unemployment  among  recent  A8  immigrants in the LFS arises because these migrants are relatively young.  Column three  of Table 12 adds additional controls for schooling, gender, race and location.  Both the  immigrant and ‘other since 2004’ dummies are now insignificant, but the 'A8 since 2004'  remains significant and positive.  Including the immigrant dummy on its own without  either of the recent immigrant terms results in it being insignificant, which is in direct  contrast to the findings for the period 2000-2003 when it is significant and positive. The  equations in columns 3 and 4 are strikingly similar.  Perhaps the most striking differences  over time are the rise in the size of the Inner London coefficient and the decline in the  size of the male coefficient, suggesting the gender gap in unemployment has narrowed.  Probabilities of being unemployed in both year groupings are higher for men, the young,  blacks and Asians, the least educated and for those living in Tyne and Wear. The positive  and significant 2006 dummies in columns 1-3 show that unemployment is significantly  higher in 2006 than it was in 2004.  The significant negative dummies for 2001-2003  show that unemployment was significantly higher in 2000.     g) Wages  Table 13 reports the results of estimating five log hourly wage equations using data from  the 2004-2006 LFS. They follow the same structure as in Blanchflower and Oswald  (1994a, 1994b).  Each equation includes a set of year dummies; race controls are added in  column 2; schooling dummies in column 3; region of work, workforce size and industry  dummies  in  column  4.    Column  5  then  adds  controls  for  recent  A8  and  non-A8  immigrants.  Adding controls has an impact – some of the difference in wages across  groups  depends  on  characteristics  particularly  schooling,  region  and  industry.   Immigrants earn 5% higher wages than non-immigrants without controls and 3% with  them.  A8 immigrants earn approximately 14% less (column 4) than non-immigrants.   Recent  A8  immigrants  earn  18%  less  than  non-immigrants;  20%  less  than  non-A8  immigrants, whether recent or not.  Recent A8 immigrants are relatively low paid.25                                                    25 Drinkwater et al (2006) found from an analysis of wages in the Labour Force Surveys of 2001-2006,   that Poles had lower rates of return to their human capital than other recent migrants, even after controlling  for other personal and job-related characteristics.    16h) Self-employment  It is appropriate to examine the incidence of (self-reported) self-employment among A8  migrants given that the self-employed do not have to register under the WRS, although  they do have to apply for a NINo, unless they work illegally in the black economy and  are paid cash in hand.  Table 14 once again uses the LFS data file for 2004-2006Q3 to  estimate a dprobit, but here the sample is restricted to workers, with the dependent  variable set to one if self-employed and zero if a worker.  The results are standard, in that  the probability of being self-employed is higher for men, Asians and Chinese, rises with  age and is especially high for those with a trade.26 It is low for blacks and those under  eighteen and for those with an HND, teaching or nursing qualification only.  Immigrants  have a higher probability of being self-employed; A8 immigrants who arrived pre-2004  have  a  particularly  high  probability  (column  1),  but  recent  immigrants  have  lower  probabilities.  As we move to the right controls are added.  Column 5 adds 21 region of  work dummies and 60 industry dummies that result in recent non-A8 immigrants having  lower self-employment rates than natives (1.7 percentage points lower), while pre-2004  A8 migrants have much higher probabilities (12.0 percentage points higher).  Recent A8  migrants have significantly higher self-employment rates than natives (5.5 percentage  points higher than non-immigrants), holding constant characteristics.      Interestingly, a number of recent Flash Eurobarometers have been carried out for a  number of countries on behalf of the European Commission, over the period 2000-2004,  on the topic of Entrepreneurship.27  The list of countries includes the 25 members of the  EU including the A8 plus the USA, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway.    Workers in these  countries were asked if “it is difficult to start one’s own business due to a lack of  financial support?”  Table 15 ranks countries according to their answers to this question  based on the proportion saying they ‘strongly agreed’ (n=32,606).  Column 2 is the  proportion who strongly agreed that “it is difficult to start one’s own business due to the  complex administrative procedures?”28  Respondents in these countries were also asked  “suppose you could choose between different kinds of jobs.  Which one would you prefer  – being an employee or being self-employed?”29  Column 3 tabulates the proportion  saying they would like to be self-employed.  It is apparent from the Table that there is a  desire for self-employment in the A8 countries as well as a perceived lack of financial  support alongside complex administrative procedures that make it hard to set up in  business.  It is well known in the literature that capital constraints have a major impact on  the  ability  to  become  and  remain  self-employed  (Blanchflower  and  Oswald  (1998;  Blanchflower, 2000, 2004).  These factors will likely contribute to a desire to come to the  UK, where these circumstances may appear less prevalent.                                                    26 See Blanchflower  (2001, 2004) and Blanchflower and Oswald (1998).    27 Flash Eurobarometers - Entrepreneurship, September 2000, September 2001, November 2002, September  2003, April 2004.    28 In both of the questions used in columns 1 and 2 possible responses were strongly agree, agree, disagree,  strongly disagree.     29 This was the same question used in Blanchflower, Oswald and Stutzer (2001) using data from the  1997/1998 International Social Survey Programme.    17In summary, holding constant a variety of characteristics including age, qualifications and  location, recent A8 immigrants have higher self-employment rates and lower wages than  natives, but similar unemployment rates.  In contrast, recent non-A8 migrants have a  higher probability of being unemployed, comparable wages and lower self-employment  rates than natives.  A8 migrants who arrived before 2004 have very low unemployment  rates and high self-employment rates, but lower wage rates than natives.      5) Review of the empirical evidence on the impact of immigration flows on natives    A big issue we need to confront is the extent to which the new wave of immigrants has  impacted the UK labour market.  The literature, from across many countries suggests that  impacts of immigration on non-immigrant employment and unemployment outcomes are  minimal, but there is some evidence of wage effects.       “Despite the popular belief that immigrants have a large adverse impact on  the wages and employment opportunities of the native-born population, the  literature  on  this  question  does  not  provide  much  support  for  this  conclusion…There is no evidence of economically significant reductions in  native employment.  Most empirical analysis of the United States and other  countries finds that a 10 per cent increase in the fraction of immigrants in  the population reduces native wages by at most 1 percent.  Even those  natives who should be the closest substitutes with immigrant labour have not  been found to suffer significantly as a result of increased immigration”,  Friedberg and Hunt (1995, p.42)    Most of the studies relate to a one-off permanent movement of workers from one country  to another, rather than movements back and forth between countries as appears to be  happening in the UK.  This is similar to (illegal) worker flows between Mexico and the  United States as well as legal flows between countries, such as India and a number of  Gulf states (eg the UAE, Qatar and Kuwait).    The empirical evidence from around the world suggests that, even when there have been  very large flows of migrants, which are greater in magnitude than the one’s the UK has  experienced from the A8, that there have been few if any measured impacts on native  outcomes.  This is confirmed by a recent report by the European Commission (2006)  which concluded that “mobility flows between the EU-10 and the EU-15 are very limited  and are simply not large enough to affect the EU labour market in general” (2006, p.13).   The Commission concluded that migrants play a complementary role in the EU-15 labour  markets alleviating skills bottlenecks and contributing to long-term growth.  Heinz and  Ward-Warmedinger (2006) drew similar conclusions, arguing that “migration of workers  from the new EU-10 did not crowd out national workers and had a positive impact on the  old  EU-15  by  alleviating  labour  market  shortages  in  certain  areas  and  supporting  increased employment” (2006, p. 26).  The International Organization for Migration  (IOM) concluded that “in a wide variety of jobs in western Europe there is hardly any  direct competition between immigrants and local workers” (2005, p.168).  The IOM went  on to conclude that “the economic gains from immigration are small, but positive, with  the benefits, however, invariably distributed unequally. Most gains accrue to the migrants  18and owners of capital, and can have positive knock-on effects for global GDP levels. The  ‘losers’ are often the local workers with similar skills to the migrants, but again the  overall losses seem minimal” (2005, p. 19).      Longhi et al (2005) recently performed a meta-analysis of 348 estimates of the percentage  change in the wage of native workers with respect to a 1 percentage point increase in the  ratio of immigrants over native workers.  Studies were examined from the US, Germany,  the Netherlands, France, Norway, Austria, Israel and Australia.  The authors concluded  that the overall impact was very small.  “A 1 percentage point increase in the proportion  of immigrants in the labour force lowers wages across the investigated studies by only  0.119%” (2005, p.472).      Australian  and  Canadian  studies,  for  example,  fail  to  show  negative  effects  of  immigration  on  labour  market  outcomes  (Addison  and  Worswick,  2002;  Pope  and  Withers (1993); Akbari and DeVoretz, 1992).  Constant (2005) also has a small effect for  France. Zorlu and Hartog (2005) examined the impact of immigration on native worker's  wages in the UK, the Netherlands and Norway and also found very small effects.       In the US, Altonji and Card (1991) found that a one percentage point increase in the  fraction of immigrants in the population reduced wages by 1.2% and did not affect  unemployment.  Card, D. (2005) has noted that “although immigration has a strong effect  on the relative supplies of different skill groups, local labour market outcomes of low  skilled natives are not much affected by these relative supply shocks” and later “overall  evidence that immigrants have harmed the opportunities of less skilled natives is scant.”   Evidence of a small negative wage effect is also found in Friedberg and Hunt (1995),  Borjas (1999) and Card and Lewis (2005).      More recently, Borjas (2003, 2006) and Borjas and Katz (2005) have argued that the  negative impacts are large.  They used national data from five censuses to show that US  workers lost on average about 3% of the real value of their wages because of immigration  over the period 1980-2000, and that this loss reached 9% for high school dropouts.  Ottaviano and Peri (2005, 2006), however, using a general equilibrium approach, find  that overall immigration from 1990-2004 has generated a large positive impact on the  average wages of the US born, primarily because they find that US and foreign born  workers belong to different skill groups.  The least educated also suffer smaller losses  than previously calculated.      Cortes  (2005)  found  that  low-skilled  immigration  benefits  the  native  population  by  decreasing the non-traded-goods component of the cost of living.  A 10 percent increase  in the average city's share of immigrants decreases the price of immigrant intensive  services, such as housekeeping and gardening, by 1.3 percent with wages being the likely  channel: Cortes found such an increase lowers the wages of low-skilled natives by 0.6  percent  and  low-skilled  immigrants  by  8  percent.    Cortes  found  that  low-skilled  immigration “brings positive benefits to the US economy, but generates a redistribution  of wealth; it reduces the real income of low-skilled natives and raises the real income of  high-skilled natives.”     19Dustman et al (2005) examined the way immigration impacted native outcomes in the  UK using data from the 1983-2000 Labour Force Surveys. They used pooled data for  eighteen years across seventeen regions (n=306) but, because of data availability, for the  period 1992-2000 for wages. Empirically they estimated a series of regressions with the  immigrant-native ratio as  a  control.    Their main  findings  were  that there was little  evidence of any adverse outcomes for natives on wages, employment or unemployment,  consistent with the findings for the US and elsewhere.  If there was evidence of any  adverse outcomes it was limited to those with intermediate levels of education.  An  increase in immigration, amounting to one per cent of the native population in their  preferred IV specification, would lead to a decrease of 0.07 percentage points in the  native  employment  rate,  but  this  was  not  significant  at  conventional  levels.  IV  is  necessary because immigrant shares and immigrant outcomes may be spatially correlated  because of common fixed influences.  Furthermore, the authors found no evidence of any  significant effects on wages, unemployment or participation using their IV specification.     Hatton and Tani (2005) also find modest wage and employment effects in the UK, but  also find evidence of negative correlations between immigration from abroad to a region  and in-migration from other regions.  These are only significant in southern regions  where immigration of foreign citizens is concentrated.  The authors suggest that this is an  important mechanism through which the British labour market adjusts.  Frijters et al.  (2005) find that immigrant job search is less successful than that of natives; immigrants  are as likely to gain employment through informal methods as via verifiable routes; the  probability of success increases with years since migration. The finding that immigrants  do not effectively compete for jobs may thus help explain why immigration has little  impact on native employment.     Manacorda  et  al  (2006)  find  evidence  that  natives  and  immigrants  in  the  UK  are  imperfect substitutes, like Ottaviano and Peri (2005, 2006) for the US.  They find that a  10% rise in the share of immigrants increases native-migrant male wage differentials by  2%.  This acts to attenuate any effect of increased labor supply on the native wage  distribution and then only has a sizeable effect on wages of migrants who were already in  the UK.  It also helps explain the findings of Dustman et al (2005) and others that the  wage impact of immigration on natives is small.    Gilpin et al (2006) recently conducted a careful econometric analysis of the impact of the  new A8 migrants.  In particular they focussed on their impact on the claimant count, as  this is not a sample. They found that:    “despite anecdotal evidence, there is no discernible statistical evidence  which supports the view that the inflow of A8 migrants is contributing to a  rise in claimant unemployment in the UK” (2006, p.49).    There have been a number of papers that have examined major flows of immigrants into a  country using natural experiments. The opening of the UK to A8 immigrants is directly  comparable to these exogenous supply shocks to the various labour  markets. These  include the Mariel boatlift into the US from Cuba in 1980 as well as from Algeria to  France in 1962 after independence; Jews to Israel from the Soviet Union between 1990  and  1994;  to  Portugal  from  Mozambique  and  Angola  in  the  mid  1970s;  to  several  20European countries as a result of the Balkan Wars in the late 1980s and early 1990s; into  Austria especially from the former Yugoslavia, and finally to Germany between 1985 and  1989,  particularly  from  Turkey.    The  evidence  from  these  studies  is  remarkably  consistent – these immigrant flows have had little or no significant/substantive impact on  any native outcomes.  There is a reason to believe that the scale of any impact from these  experiments would be greater than that from the A8 in the UK, as in most cases the scale  of the influx was greater, and in many cases, there was no potential return of the migrants  to their country of origin as is occurring in the UK.    a) USA  On April 20th 1980 Fidel Castro declared that Cuban nationals wishing to go to the US  could leave freely from the port of Mariel, and approximately 125,000 did.  Card (1990)  found that wages and employment opportunities for Miami's population were hardly  impacted at all by the boatlift.  The trends observed in Miami were comparable to those  in other cities such as Atlanta, Houston, Tampa and Los Angeles that did not experience  the Mariel flow.  In fact the wages of unskilled black workers rose relative to wages in  the four comparison cities.  Similarly, the unemployment rate among low-skilled blacks  improved.    Among  Hispanics  there  was  an  increase  in  Miami's  unemployment  rate  relative  to  that  in  the  other  cities  in  1981,  but  from  1982-1985  the  Hispanic  unemployment rate in Miami fell faster than in the comparison cities.  It does appear  though that some residents left Miami in response to Mariel and other migrants went  elsewhere; the rate of Miami's population growth after 1980 slowed considerably relative  to the rest of Florida.     b) France   Hunt (1992) examined the impact of the arrival of 900,000 people of European origin  returning to France within one year following the independence of Algeria in 1962,  which increased France’s labour force by 2%.  Hunt found that, despite the fact that the  repatriates had high unemployment rates themselves, there was no evidence that this flow  of  migrants  had  any  sizable  impact  on  unemployment  of  non-repatriates.    A  one  percentage point higher proportion of repatriates implied an increase in non-repatriate  unemployment of at most 0.2 percentage points.  There was also weak evidence on the  impact on wages – a one percentage point higher proportion of repatriates was associated  with 0.8% lower wages.  The labour-force participation of non-repatriates was unaffected  by the presence of the repatriates.    c) Portugal  Carrington and deLima (1996) found that when the African colonies of Mozambique and  Angola  became  independent  of  Portuguese  colonial  control  in  the  mid  1970s,  approximately  600,000  people  returned  to  Portugal,  increasing  its  population  by  approximately 7%.  The returnados, who were at least as skilled as Portuguese natives,  “had only a modest effect on the Portuguese labour market” (1996, p.341).  Comparisons  with Spain and France suggested that any adverse impacts were quantitatively swamped  by the European-wide downturn in labour market conditions in the 1970s.  Comparisons  across districts within Portugal showed that those with a higher proportion of immigrants  did have lower wage growth, but because of the timing and persistence of the wage  effects there are questions about whether the returnados were the cause of the wage  downturn.  21d) Israel  Immigration increased Israel's population by 12 percent between 1990 and 1994 after  immigration restrictions were lifted in the Soviet Union, increasing the population by  over 7 percent in two years.  Friedberg (2001) examined the impact of this rapid influx of  workers.    She  found  that  following  the  influx  occupations  that  employed  more  immigrants  had  substantially  lower  native  wage  growth  and  slightly  lower  native  employment growth.  Using OLS she found that a 10 percent increase in occupational  employment because of immigration was associated with a 3-6 percent decline in the real  earnings of natives in that occupation.  However, because the immigrants' post-migration  occupational  distribution  is  influenced  by  relative  labor  market  conditions  across  occupations, OLS estimates are biased.  Using IV, with previous occupation as the  instrument, Friedberg found no adverse impact of immigration on any native outcomes  including wages and employment of natives.      e) Germany  Pischke and Velling (1997) examined the impact of the influx of foreign workers into  Germany  between  1985  and  1989,  particularly  from  Turkey,  on  employment  and  unemployment rates.  Between these two years the share of Turks in the population rose  from 1.6% to 1.9%, while the foreign share of the population rose from 4.9% to 5.6%.  Their results “consistently show that there is little evidence for displacement effects due  to  immigration  (p.  603).”    This  is  consistent  with  the  findings  of  Mühleisen  and  Zimmermann  (1994),  who  also  found  negligible  impacts  of  foreign  labour  on  unemployment in Germany.     f) Austria  Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1996, 1999) examined the impact of a dramatic rise in  the  share  of  alien  workers  in  Austria  as  a  result  of  the  breakdown  of  the  former  communist regimes, especially from former Yugoslavia.  Between 1988 and 1991 the  foreign share of employment in Austria increased from 5.4% to 9.0%. Winter-Ebmer and  Zweimüller (1999) find only a modest impact of immigration on the unemployment risk  for native workers under the age of 35.  Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1996) found  negligible or even positive wage effects.    g) Europe  Angrist and Kugler (2003) use the Balkan Wars as a Mariel-boatlift style immigration  experiment to examine the impact of immigration in the European Economic Area for  1983-1999.  There was very little change in immigration flow until 1988, but the late  1980s and early 1990s saw a marked upturn.  The increases were greatest for Germany,  beginning in 1989 and later in Finland, France and Sweden.  The flow from Yugoslavia  was particularly important after 1990.  Angrist and Kugler (2003) found that an increase  in the foreign share of 10% would reduce native employment rates by 0.2-0.7 percentage  points.  There  was  also  some  evidence  that  the  impact  of  the  foreign  share  on  the  employment of native men was greatest in countries with less flexible labour markets,  higher replacement rates and higher entry costs.  The estimates typically imply more  native job losses in countries with less flexible labour and product markets.     22The empirical evidence from around the world suggests that, even when there have been  very large flows of migrants, which are greater in magnitude than the one’s the UK has  experienced from the A8, that there have been few, if any, measured impacts on native  outcomes.    6) The macro-economic policy consequences of A8 migration  a) Immigration and inflation    The Monetary Policy Committee is interested in immigration to the extent that it affects  inflation and growth in the medium term.  The purpose of this section is to bring together  the findings reported earlier in this paper to make a judgement about the prospects for  growth and inflation in the near term, as we see them at present.    The overall impact of immigration, including immigration from the A8 countries, on  inflation and growth is on its own not clear-cut – there is no automatic rule-of-thumb that  we can look to in order to determine the impact on the economy.  This is because  immigrants are both consumers and workers/producers, and so immigration affects both  aggregate demand and aggregate supply.  And it is the balance between demand and  supply (sometimes called the output gap) that determines inflation.  So the MPC needs to  take a judgement about whether immigration has added more to supply or to demand in  recent years.  We look at each of these in turn.    In thinking about the supply potential of the economy, most people would probably agree  that extra (immigrant) workers in the economy would raise the supply potential of the  economy.    But  the  extent  to  which  aggregate  supply  increases  will  depend  on  the  economic characteristics of immigrants relative to native workers.  A recent survey of  contacts of the Bank of England’s regional Agents suggested that the new A8 migrants  were highly productive.  This is consistent with the findings of a Home Office Study on  the use of migrant labour that concluded as follows.    “Employers cited advantages of migrant workers in terms of their general  attitude and work ethic. They tended to be more motivated, reliable and  committed than domestic workers.  For example, migrants were said to be  more likely to: demonstrate lower turnover and absenteeism; be prepared  to work longer and flexible hours; be satisfied with their duties and hours  of work; and work harder in terms of productivity and speed. In the view  of some employers, the more favourable work ethic of migrant workers  encouraged domestic workers to work harder.” (Dench, 2006)      In Saleheen and Shadforth (2006) it was argued that immigration of higher skilled (or  more  productive)  workers  could  temporarily  raise  the  domestic  rate  of  productivity  growth; and that immigrant labour could lower the natural rate of unemployment, either  by  filling  skill  gaps  (assuming  that  foreign-born  workers  are  complementary  to  the  domestic workforce) or by tempering wage demands, as wage bargainers become aware  that they can be replaced more easily than in the past.  In support of the latter argument,  the OECD Economic Outlook (2006b) notes that “international as well as UK evidence  23suggests [that] immigration can serve to make the labour market as a whole more fluid  and wages less sensitive to demand fluctuations.”  Katz and Krueger (1999) argue that  recruitment agencies for temporary workers have also contributed to declines in the  natural  rate.    Shimer  (1998)  argues  that  time  series  changes  in  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment in the US are driven by demographic changes; the declining natural rate  of unemployment over the last decade or so has resulted from declines in the proportion  of individuals in the population that had high propensities for unemployment.  So the  aging of the baby boom generation was particularly important as the proportion of the  population that was young – and subject to high unemployment rates – declined over  time.  The analogy for the UK is that the workforce has increased in size as a result of  adding a group – the A8 – with a relatively low propensity to be unemployed and to claim  benefits.  The workforce appears more flexible and mobile than it was before the entry of  workers from the A8.30  They had no entitlement to benefits so the replacement rate in the  economy has fallen, once again lowering the natural rate of unemployment.  These A8  migrants have likely reduced the natural rate through their impact on the wage bargaining  process, lowering the bargaining power of native workers.  The ‘fear’ of unemployment  has risen (Blanchflower, 1991).    In thinking about aggregate demand, most people would agree that immigrants are extra  consumers  and  that  they  raise  aggregate  consumption  demand.    It  is  likely  that  immigrants spend a lower fraction of their income when compared to domestic workers,  perhaps because they send remittances back home or spend less on durable goods while  temporarily resident in the UK – this would, on its own, suggest that immigrants raise  demand by less than they raise supply.31  However, the funds that migrants send home  might be recycled back to the UK through greater export demand, and UK consumers  might also benefit from lower prices as a result of the extra productivity of migrants.  Aggregate demand might also rise because of increased investment.  The theoretical  argument here is that firms require both labour and capital to produce their output.   Immigration gives them more labour, and firms may wish to supplement this with more  capital.  But the extent to which investment rises, and how quickly, will depend on the  skills of immigrants and the technologies of firms.  If firms are able to substitute between  labour  and  capital,  then  there  may  be  a  smaller  impact  on  investment  than  might  otherwise be the case.  Early work by Welch (1969), Griliches (1970) and Berndt and  Christensen (1974) all suggested that physical capital is more complementary with skilled  than with unskilled labour. More recently, Lewis (2006) found that US cities with a larger  share  of  migrant  labour  are  also  the  ones  with  less  capital  intensive  production  technologies.                                                       30 Borjas (2001) argues that immigration “greases the wheels of the labor market by injecting into the  economy a group of persons who are very responsive to regional differences in economic opportunities”  (2001, p.2).  This has the effect of improving labour market efficiency and hence leads to a more efficient  allocation of national resources.    31 Saleheen and Shadforth (2006) show that according to IPS data, most immigrants intend to stay in the  United Kingdom for a maximum of four years.    24On balance we would suggest that at present it appears that recent A8 immigration has  acted to reduce the natural rate of unemployment in the UK and raised the supply  potential of the economy. But it also seems that recent immigration is likely to have  raised potential supply by more than it has raised demand, and thereby has acted to  reduce  inflationary  pressures.    This  argument  holds  for  three  reasons.    First,  the  consumption behaviour of native workers may have been affected by the increased ‘fear’  of unemployment resulting from a more flexible labour market.  Second, the recycling of  remitted funds back to the UK is unlikely to be perfect.  Third, firms may able to  substitute between capital and labour, offsetting some of the potential for investment  spending to rise.       Is the recent rise in the unemployment rate structural?    While we currently believe that immigration on its own is likely to have reduced the  natural rate of unemployment and inflationary pressures in the past few years, there are  off-setting forces that may have pushed the natural rate back up more recently.  In  particular, developments in the labour market over the past year, such as the up-rating of  the national minimum wage (NMW) and the rising participation of older workers could  have, ceteris paribus, raised the natural rate, with corresponding implications for inflation  and growth prospects going forward.    A key question surrounding these prospects is how to interpret the recent rise in the actual  unemployment rate.  If it has occurred without a rise in the natural rate of unemployment  then one might conclude that there is more slack in the labour market relative to the past,  and continued immigration is likely to keep inflationary pressures down in the future.   But, if the natural rate has risen then there is more uncertainty about whether spare  capacity has risen over the past year.    Why  might  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  have  risen?    In  the  section  on  the  characteristics of immigrants we found that immigrants are more likely to be young, and  that the pay of new immigrants (including those from the A8 countries) is lower than that  of previous immigrants and UK-born workers. Given this, a rise in labour supply via  immigration will mean that there will be a larger fraction of young workers in the  economy  who  have  a  higher  probability  of  unemployment.    This  change  to  the  demographic mix of the population may raise the natural rate.32 Similarly the increased  participation of older workers may also have raised the natural rate of unemployment if  they have displaced younger workers.  Or, if the level of the NMW is set at rate that is  higher than the level at which local labour markets would otherwise clear, this will tend  to lower the demand for labour and raise the natural rate of unemployment.  The rise in  the NMW, coupled with the fact immigrant workers tend to earn less – and so are likely  to benefit from the rise in the NMW – could also lead to a rise in the natural rate of                                                    32 Shimer (1998) finds that demographic changes – such as shifts in the labour force to groups with  different propensities to being unemployed – are important determinants of the natural rate.  He argues that  changes in demographics can explain the bulk of the decline in the NAIRU and seems to fit very closely  with Staiger, Stock and Watson's (1997) estimate of the NAIRU, except during the Vietnam war.     25unemployment.    These  changes  could  more  than  cancel  out  any  declines  from  A8  immigration outlined above.    The challenge for policy makers is that it is very difficult to obtain an accurate estimate  of the natural rate of unemployment, particularly in real time.  But policy makers need to  take a judgment about the degree of spare capacity in the economy, and that requires  some judgment about the natural rate of unemployment.  For that reason we investigate  whether the recent rise in unemployment is related to the three structural changes outlined  above: the rise in immigration; the participation of older workers; and, the up-rating of  the NMW.  If it is, then one might argue that the rise in the unemployment rate has been  accompanied by a rise in the natural rate of unemployment.  This analysis exploits the  regional variation in each of these factors, but is unable to provide conclusive evidence of  any change.      First, has the recent rise in unemployment been highest in regions which have seen the  largest increase in immigration?  Chart 3 shows new immigrants – those arriving since  the start of 2004 – are more likely to settle, at least initially, in London than elsewhere.   Chart 4 shows the change in the share of new immigrants going to each region.  The fact  that London is negative means that a smaller share of immigrants settled in London in  2006, compared to 2005.  The regions that have seen a falling share of migrants are  London, the East, North East, North West, Yorkshire & Humber and Wales: three (Y&H,  NE & London) out of these six regions have also seen some of the largest increases in  their unemployment rates (Chart 5).  But, Chart 6 shows the opposite of what we might  have expected; regions with the biggest increases in immigration have tended to see the  smallest rises in their unemployment rates.33, 34 Of course, this is consistent with the  possibility that foreign workers are attracted to those regions where the unemployment  rate is lowest and opportunities are greatest, for which there appears to be some evidence  (Chart 7).                                                                         33 Note that the negative correlation shown in Chart 6 is not statistically significant.  A regression of the  change in the total unemployment rate (between 2005q3 and 2006q3) on the change in the share of new  immigrants (between 2005 and 2006) gives a t-statistic of -1.02.     34 We look at changes in the regional share of immigrants in charts 6, 9 and 12.  One might consider  weighting the shares to reflect the number of employees in each region as a bigger effect might be expected  in regions which have received more migrants.  However, WRS data suggest that while most migrants  settle in London and the South East, the ratio of A8 migrants to the current population by region is broadly  the same nationwide, at around 1:67.    26Chart 3: The share of new immigrants in  Chart 4: The change in the share of new  each region (2006)  immigrants going to each region (2006  less 2005)  per cent 35 per cent 30 2.5 25 2.0 1.5 20 1.0 15 0.5 10 0.0 -0.5 5 -1.0 0 -1.5 Wales  North East N Ireland East Scotland South West West Midlands North West East Midlands Yorks&Humber South East London London East North East North West orks&Humber Wales  Scotland East Midlands South West West Midlands N Ireland South East --22..50 Y Chart 5: The change in the rate of  Chart 6: Have regions with the biggest  unemployment across regions (2005q3- rise in unemployment also seen the  2006q3)  biggest rise in immigration (2006 less  2005)?  per cent Change in the unemployment rate, pp 2.0 2.0 1.5 Lon YH 1.5 WM 1.0 NW 1.0 EM 0.5 East SE 0.5 Wa 0.0 NE SW NI 0.0 -0.5 -1.0 -0.5 Sc Scotland South West North East N Ireland South East Wales  East Midlands East North West London West Midlands orks&Humber -1.0-3 C-h2ange in- t1he share0 of new m1igrants, p2p 3 Y Chart 7: Regional unemployment rates    in 2005 and the change in immigration  (2006 less 2005)    Unemployment rate in 2005 8.0   7.0 NE Lon   6.0 Sc   5.0 NW WM NI   Wa YH SE 4.0 EM   East 3.0 SW   2.0 Sources:  ONS and LFS micro-data, 2005- 1.0 2006Q3    0.0 -5 0 5 10 15 Notes  New immigrants between 2005 & 2006 (000s) 1. pp = percentage points  27However, we know that most immigrants are young (43% of workers on the WRS are  aged 18-24), and that the most recent rise in the aggregate unemployment rate has been  driven  by  an  increase  in  youth  unemployment.    In  fact,  the  proportion  of  total  unemployment accounted for by 18-24 year olds has been rising steadily, from 24.3% of  the total in 2000, to 30.7% in 2006Q3.35  So what about the possibility that the influx of  migrants has increased the youth unemployment rate?      Chart  8  shows  regions  with  the  largest  increases  in  total  unemployment  were  not  necessarily regions with the largest increases in youth unemployment.  Chart 9 shows that  there is only a weakly positive (but statistically insignificant) relationship between those  regions that have witnessed the largest increases in youth unemployment and those that  have seen the biggest influxes of new immigrants.  So it seems that the increase in the  unemployment rate of 18-24 year olds has had relatively little to do with the influx of  migrants.

The horizontal axis in Chart 10 plots the change in the activity rates of  workers above state pension age36 between 2005Q3 and 2006Q3 for all regions in the  UK. Activity rates among older workers have increased in all regions, but there appears  to  be  no  correlation  between  the  increased  activity  rates  of  older  workers  and  the  increased  unemployment  rates  of  youth  workers  at  a  regional  level.  The  outlier  observation on the bottom right of the chart is Wales.                                                          35 This rise has occurred subsequent to the NMW being implemented on April 1st 1999.    36 Age 60 for women and 65 for men.    28Chart 10: Have regions with the biggest    rise in older workers activity rates also  seen the biggest rise in youth  unemployment (2005q3-2006q3)?

There may be  something in this, especially given the most recent increases in the NMW on October 1st  2006: from £5.05 to £5.35 (5.9%) for those aged over 22; from £4.25 to £4.45 (4.7%) for  18-21 year olds; and from £3 to £3.30 (10.0%) for 16-17 year olds.37      The minimum wage is set nationwide in nominal terms and hence its real level varies  markedly by region; its real value is much higher outside London and the South East and  that is where it is expected to bite (Stewart, 2002), because it will enter at a higher point  on the wage distribution.  The minimum is also most likely to bind for unskilled 22-24  year olds who are paid adult rates and 18 year olds who jump from the 16-17 year olds’  rate.      Chart 11 shows how two of the NMW rates compare to wages at the bottom end (10th  percentile) of the wage distribution in each region using ASHE, and additionally for each  age group using the LFS  micro-data.  According to the data, the newly announced  minimum wages are likely to be a binding constraint for employers in all regions except  London and the South East for the over 22’s and in all regions for those aged 18-21.   Taking the LFS data at face value, it is possible that employers may respond to (or have  already responded to) the higher minimum wage rates by cutting back on employment.  If  that were the case, then one might argue that the natural rate of unemployment may have  been pushed up recently.                                                         37 Between April 1999 and October 2006 both the Adult and Development rates rose by approximately 48%  Earnings, as measured by the whole economy AEI, have risen by 35% between April 1999 and September  2006 both including and excluding bonus payments).    29Chart 11: Does the minimum wage bind  Chart 12: Have regions hit the hardest  in different regions?  by the national minimum wage seen the  biggest rise in youth unemployment?

The chart excludes from the LFS data those earning less than  £1 per hour.      There are estimates from the Department of Trade and Industry of the number of workers  in each region who are likely to get a pay rise as a consequence of the recent rises in the  NMW.38  We compute a measure of the ‘share’ of workers in each region who will be  affected by the NMW by dividing this DTI estimate by the total number of employees in  each region.  Against this we plot the change in youth unemployment (Chart 12).  The  chart shows that regions hit most by the NMW are also the regions which have seen the  biggest rise in the youth unemployment rate, though the relationship is not statistically  significant.     Most studies39 have failed to find statistically significant evidence that the introduction of  the NMW, and past increases to it, have had adverse affects on the demand for labour and  employment.  While it is too early to test the impact of the most recent increment, it is  clear that if the NMW continues to rise then eventually it will start to have an impact on  the amount of labour firms employ and the natural rate of unemployment.     In summary    Over the past eighteen months the unemployment rate has risen by 0.8 percentage points.   To find out whether this rise in unemployment has been related to structural factors we  have  investigated  whether  regional  changes  in  the  unemployment  rate  have  been  correlated with changes in the share of new immigrants, older worker activity rates or  estimates of the number of people that will benefit from rises in the NMW.  We have                                                    38 See Department of Trade and Industry (2006) Government evidence to the low pay commission on the  economic effects of the National Minimum Wage, Table F2)    39 See for example Dickens and Draca (2005) and Stewart (2002, 2004).    30found that there are no significant relationships between any of these variables and the  rise in actual (and youth) unemployment rates across regions.      Of course, there may be other macro-economic factors that might have raised the natural  rate of unemployment, at least temporarily.  Nickell (2006) has noted that the equilibrium  rate of unemployment will rise if workers attempt to sustain rates of real wage growth  when the rate consistent with stable employment shifts unexpectedly.  If workers persist  in attempting to bargain for rates of real wage growth which take no account of the  movement in the terms of trade, this will tend to raise unemployment.  Exactly the same  argument applies if there is an unexpected fall in trend productivity growth, perhaps  brought about by rises in oil prices or an increase in labour taxes.  For example, if labour  taxes (payroll tax rates plus income tax rates plus consumption tax rates) go up, the real  post-tax consumption wage must fall if real labour costs per employee facing firms are  not to rise.  Any resistance to this fall would lead to a rise in unemployment.  To this  point there is no evidence of significant wage resistance or second round effects from the  recent oil shock; wage increases have remained benign, presumably in part because of the  dampening effect of the recent A8 migrant flow.    Our findings are not conclusive evidence, but they do suggest that the recent rise in the  unemployment rate is unrelated to structural factors.  In other words, there is no evidence  from the labour market that the natural rate of unemployment has risen in the past year.   Policymakers may therefore interpret the rise in  the actual unemployment rate as a  reflection of greater slack in the labour market now compared to a year ago, which is  likely to keep wage and inflationary pressures subdued in the near future.      Conclusion    UK  population  growth  over  the  last  thirty-five  years  has  been  remarkably  low  in  comparison with other countries; the population grew by just 7% between 1971 and 2004,  less than all the other EU15 countries (except Germany), Australia, Canada, Japan, New  Zealand and the United States, plus China and India.  The rate of UK population growth  did exceed that of six countries from the former Soviet bloc (Czech Republic; Croatia;  Estonia; Hungary; Latvia and Bulgaria), but was below the rates of growth of Poland,  Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia.    The UK population has grown at a faster pace since the turn of the millennium. This  recent growth has been driven primarily by changes in net migration.  Both the inflow  and outflow migration rates have risen but the inflow rate has risen more rapidly, most  recently, with an influx of migrants from eight East European countries.  However, the  increase in the net migration flow predates the influx of A8 migrants, reflecting a steady  rise in the number of immigrants from Asia and the Middle East too.     The propensity to migrate to the UK is higher the lower is GDP per capita in each of the  A8 countries.  The decision is also strongly correlated with life satisfaction scores and  unemployment rates, but is uncorrelated with employment rates or rates of inflation.      There  appears  to  be  consistent  evidence  from  the  Worker  Registration  Scheme  and  National Insurance Number applications that approximately 500,000 migrants from the  31A8 countries had come to work in the UK between May 2004 and late 2006.  But other  sources suggest a significant proportion of these workers – perhaps as many as a half -  have returned to their country of origin.      The  empirical  literature  from  around  the  world  suggests  little  or  no  evidence  that  immigrants have had a major impact on native labour market outcomes such as wages  and unemployment.  Recent work by a number of other authors for the UK is also  consistent with this view.    The impact of recent migration from the A8 countries on the UK economy will be  determined by the extent to which immigrants add to supply relative to demand, since it  is the balance between these two factors that determines prospects for inflation.  We  argue that at present it appears that A8 immigration has tended to increase supply by  more than it has increased demand in the UK (in the short run), and thereby acted to  reduce inflationary pressures.     There seems to be broad agreement that immigration is likely to have reduced the natural  rate of unemployment in the UK over the past few years.  But there is some uncertainty  about what has happened to the natural rate in the very recent past and what might  happen to it in the near future.  This is because immigration has not been the only shock  to affect the labour market very recently.  This paper examines the relationship between  the rising unemployment rate and other structural developments across regions, but fails  to find any statistically significant relationships.  It seems appropriate to conclude that the  natural rate of unemployment has probably not risen in the very recent past and that  recent immigration continues to suppress inflationary pressures.

Based mainly on data from the  International Passenger Survey. Includes adjustments for (1) those whose intended length of stay changes  so that their migrant status changes; (2) asylum seekers and their dependants not identified by the IPS; and  (3) flows between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Up to and including 2003, estimates are shown only  for the EU15 (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy,  Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden). From 2004, the estimates are also shown for A8  (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) and the EU25  (i.e. the EU15 and A8 groups, plus Malta and Cyprus). British citizens are excluded from all EU groupings  and are shown separately. Includes estimates of South African citizenship for all years.  From 2004, the  New Commonwealth excludes Malta and Cyprus.

Workers only       50Appendix A – Sources of Data on the numbers of individuals who have arrived in  the UK    1) Migrants from the A8 are obliged to register on the Home Office administered Worker  Registration Scheme (WRS) if they are employed in the UK for a month or more.   Nationals of the A8 countries who wish to take up employment in the UK for a period of  at least a month are generally required to register with the Home Office to work in the  UK.  Workers  who  are  self-employed do  not  need  to  register  and  are  therefore  not  included in these figures; there may also be other workers from the accession countries  who for one reason or another do not register and are thus also not included in these  figures.  Failure to apply within one month of starting a job means the employment is  illegal.      There was a £50 charge (now raised to £70) for the first application.  Individuals working  in the UK before May 2004 without permission must also register.  After a year of  constant legal employment, migrants do not have to register on the WRS, instead they are  entitled to a residence permit which gives the holder the right to live and work in the UK.  The data from the WRS provided here are data on applicants to the scheme rather than  applications. Applicants must register more than once if they are employed by more than  one employer. They must also re-register if they change employer. Each application to  the WRS therefore represents one job, not one applicant. To avoid counting applicants  more than once, each applicant is represented only once in the data, with information  relating to the first job for which he/she registered.  Workers from these accession  countries are generally required to have work continuously for 12 months before they are  entitled to income related benefits.40     2)  International  Passenger Survey  (IPS)  which  is a voluntary survey  of individuals  passing through the main UK air and sea ports and the Channel Tunnel.  The IPS  questions 250,000 passengers annually of whom only 1% are migrants.  The survey is  based on respondent's intended length of stay and includes questions on age, sex, marital  status, citizenship and country of last residence.  The benefit of the IPS is that it provides  data on those who leave as well as those who enter the country making it possible to  measure net flows.    c) National Insurance number allocations to overseas nationals.41  NINos are required for  employment/self-employment  purposes  or  to  claim  benefits  and  tax  credits.    The  Department  of  Work  and  Pensions  is  responsible  for  allocating  NINos  to  overseas  nationals  who  apply  to  their  local  Jobcentre  Plus  office.    An  interview  occurs  and  documentation is examined which may include the use of ultra-violet lighting to ensure                                                    40 Accession Monitoring Report May 2004 – June 2006, Home Office, 22 August 2006.,     41 National Insurance number allocations to overseas nationals entering the UK', Department of Work and  Pensions, 2006      51passports  and  visas  are  genuine.

Once the NINo is allocated HMRC add the NINo onto the  National Insurance recording System (NIRS) which holds details of national insurance  contributions and income tax.    d) Work permits  Over the period 1995 to 2004 total approvals including work permits, first permissions,  extensions, changes of employment and supplementary employment increased by 326 per  cent, but was followed by a 7 percent fall in 2005 (Salt and Millar, 2006).  The largest  annual increases were between 2000 and 2001 as a consequence of the IT boom.  In terms  of the nationalities covered, out of 86,191 work permits and first permissions 33.9% were  for Indian nationals followed by 10.7% from the USA.  This compares with 24,161  admitted in 1995 of which 8.3% were from India and 32.6% from the USA.    The employment of people who are subject to immigration control is regulated by the  granting of work permits.  Under the 1971 Immigration Act a work permit is issued to a  specific employer for a named person for a specific job.  A work permit has to be issued  for all foreign nationals who are not EEA citizens and who wish to work in the UK unless  they enter on another work-related scheme or have some other status (such as student)  where some work is allowed.42      There are five other categories of work permit application a) First Permission – this is  similar to the work permit but is granted for foreign workers who are already living in the  UK who do not already have a permit to work. b) In country extension – application from  an employer who wishes to extend the employment of an individual currently working for  them in the UK. c) In country change of employment – application from an employer  who wishes to employ an individual already in the UK who originally entered with a  work permit for a different employer or who wishes to engage an individual in other work  for the same employer. d) In country technical change – applications from employers  who wish to continue to engage an individual in the same job, but where minor details  have changed, such as the address the individual is working at, or if the individual or the  employer has changed their name. e)  Work permit extension – extension applications  from employers to extend the employment of an individual who is out of the UK at the  time the application is considered.  A8 nationals were covered by work permits are  included in figures prior to may 2004.    e) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a continuous household survey, which provides a  wide  range  of  data  on  labour  market  statistics  and  related  topics  such  as  training,  qualifications, income and disability. The LFS has been running since Spring 1992 in its  present form, although a LFS has been carried out in Britain since 1973. Between 1973  and 1983, a biennial survey was carried out during the spring.  In 1984, the survey  became annual.  In Spring 1992, for the first time, the data were made available quarterly,                                                    42 For further details of work permits etc see Salt and Millar (2006) pages 354-355.      52with a quarterly sample size approximately equivalent to that of the previous annual data,  thus becoming the Quarterly Labour Force Survey.  Each quarter, interviews are achieved  at about 59,000 addresses with about 138,000 respondents.  From January 2006 the LFS  moved to calendar quarters.    As noted by Saleheen and Shadforth (2006) the LFS relies on additional information  about the size and composition of the population – population weights – to produce an  estimate of the “true” immigrant population. The accuracy of the survey will also depend  on how representative the sample is of the population.  For example, it might be the case  that immigrants, particularly illegal immigrants, are less likely to respond to the LFS  survey, so that they are underrepresented in the LFS data.  Similarly, if immigrants,  particularly temporary immigrants, are less likely to live at private addresses and more  likely to live in communal establishments, such as guest houses or hotels, the LFS data  will not accurately reflect the size and characteristics of the immigrant population.  Data  from the 2001 Census suggest that immigrants are more likely than UK-born individuals  to  live  in  communal  establishments.    But  just  1%  of  the  total  population  lived  in  communal establishments in 2001, suggesting that this is not a major problem, but there  is some uncertainty about whether the problem has worsened in more recent years.43                                                    43 2% of the immigrant population lived in communal establishments in 2001.     53References    Akbari, A.H. and D.J.
