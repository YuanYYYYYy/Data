Indeed, I also went to Canton High School for  Boys, subsequently Cantonian High School, just down the road from here in Llandaff  from 1966 to 1970.  There are one or two people still here who even taught me all  those years ago.      In this speech I will consider the future for monetary policy. The current institutional  framework has been found wanting. While we cannot expect to abolish the cycle, the  credit crisis has been just too costly. Reform is required. The ‘one-tool one-target’  approach to monetary policy of using Bank Rate to target CPI inflation has been  inadequate. Inflation targeting alone will not suffice. This approach failed to prevent  the build-up of imbalances that presaged the crisis and was insufficient in dealing  with failing banks and financial market stress as the crisis developed. There is now a  consensus that new tools are required to regulate the financial sector and prevent such  crises in the future.     This  debate  has  focussed  on  methods  to  limit  bank  lending  over  the  cycle.  Unfortunately,  current  macroeconomic  research  has  had  little  to  say  about  bank  lending, financial instability and house and asset price bubbles. So we are largely  starting from scratch. We do not possess a coherent intellectual framework to describe  how such macro-prudential instruments might operate and how they would interact  with more traditional policy instruments such as the Bank Rate and the CPI inflation  target. Providing such a framework will be a challenge.    In this speech I would like to describe how we arrived at the current crisis and how  policy might have operated differently. I will describe the global context of the crisis,  events within the financial sector and our policy responses to them. I will then offer  some thoughts on where macroeconomic research can help to fill in the gaps in our  1current  thinking,  and  finally  what  changes  to  the  policy  framework  we  might  consider.    2. THE GLOBAL CONTEXT    The problems facing the UK and global economy stem from those identified, but not  solved, at Bretton Woods (at the Mount Washington Hotel which is just up the road  from my Dartmouth office in the White Mountains of New Hampshire). That is,  placing responsibilities on those countries that run persistent current account surpluses  and deficits. The credit crisis reflects developments in the debtor countries such as the  UK and United States but also in the surplus countries such as China (see Chart 1).     In the UK, the falling household savings rate, high levels of indebtedness and bubbles  in house and asset prices have been linked to the strong growth and light regulation of  the financial sector. But the underlying imbalances in the global economy were also  the product of the capital controls, fixed exchange rate regimes and high savings rates  in emerging Asian economies such as China. The counterpart to any laissez-fair  approach in developed economies was an interventionist policy approach and under- developed financial sector in the emerging Asian economies. Why did this come  about?    Following the Asian crisis in 1997, the painful experience of rising debt, capital  outflows and currency depreciation led to a reassessment of economic policy. The  outcome for many developing economies was export-led growth strategies, associated  with  fixed  or  managed  foreign  exchange  regimes,  and  current  account  surpluses  driven by rapidly expanding export growth.     For a decade, stunning growth in the Chinese manufacturing sector was matched by  the exuberance of Wall Street and the City of London as the world economy enjoyed  an  exceptionally  prolonged  period  of  growth.  This  success  reflected  disparate  economies  pursuing  their  comparative  advantages.  The  Chinese  economy  rapidly  expanded employment of its enormous pool of low paid, low skilled, labour. In some  developed  economies  the  manufacturing  sector  performed  relatively  poorly  as  services, particularly financial services, grew as a share of the economy. And it wasn’t  2only  investment  bankers  that  joined  in  the  party!  Falling  imported  goods  prices  pushed up on real incomes throughout the developed world and credit was extended  ever more favourably, often to the least credit worthy.     We should not forget the success of the last decade. Chart 2 illustrates that world real  GDP per capita grew at exceptionally high rates over the last five years. In previous  decades,  economists  had  struggled  to  explain  the  lack  of  convergence  in  living  standards between the rich and poor nations. Economists now ask how quickly living  standards in India and China will converge with our own. It is important to remember  this success at a time when free trade and globalisation are being questioned.    Ultimately, as is so often the case in economic development, the configuration of  global growth became unbalanced, dependent on an unsustainable flow of capital  from the surplus countries such as China to the main debtor countries such as the UK  and United States. This flow of capital pushed down on interest rates, up on house and  asset prices, and contributed to rising levels of debt in the deficit countries.     The size of global current account imbalances received much attention and concern.  The implications for house and asset prices from the configuration of global growth,  and the exchange rate policies pursued by Asian central banks was first recognised by  Ben Bernanke in his speeches on the ‘global savings glut’ in 2005.1 But little policy  action was taken. In fact, the combination of floating exchange rates for developed  economies and interventionist foreign exchange policies by Asian central banks were  labelled  by  some  as  Bretton  Woods  II,  as  if  the  global  imbalances  they  were  associated with were sustainable.2 More recently, there have been calls for a ‘new  Bretton Woods’ to rethink the global financial system.3    However, we need to understand that the interventionist policies in emerging Asian  economies reflected a lack of confidence in their own domestic financial systems  following on from the Asian crisis. Part of the solution to the world’s imbalances will                                                    1 Ben S.

"World needs new Bretton Woods, says Brown”  3not  only  be  greater  regulation  of  financial  markets  and  bank  lending  within  the  developed economies, but also the freeing up of capital markets, and development of  the financial sector in developing Asian economies, so that their growth can be less  reliant on exports and driven more by domestic demand. Nevertheless, we need to put  our own house in order.    3. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR    Why did our banks take such enormous risks? The primary reason was the influx of  capital from developing Asian economies into the global financial system which  pushed down on bond yields. This led banks and financial institutions to take ever  greater risks in their ‘search for yield’ subject to diminishing scrutiny from both  shareholders and regulators. But why did investors and regulators allow such risks to  be taken? First, as time elapsed since the last severe recession in the early 1990s,  investors and regulators may have placed too small a probability on such a recession  reoccurring.  Second,  investors  may  have  been  over-confident  in  their  statistical  models of risk, and risk management strategies. Third, some academic economists  indicated that there had been an improvement in the conduct of monetary and fiscal  policies and a structural reduction in the volatility of the macro-economy. The idea  that recessions belonged to some crude distant past permeated.    In their optimism, investment bankers found ever more creative ways to channel the  flow of easy credit to the most risky borrowers – in particular in the US sub-prime  mortgage market. Complex assets were designed such as mortgage backed securities.  Through the alchemy of bundling risky and riskier borrowers together within opaque  structures it appeared that investment bankers had turned lead into gold. Credit rating  agencies were certainly convinced by the new technology, awarding generous credit  ratings to the new assets that had been created. Many banks became dependent on  wholesale funding, through the ‘originate and distribute’ model and increased their  leverage. In short, few people expected that the era of cheap money would end and  their pricing of risk was based on that premise.     4As Warren Buffet has said, ‘only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been  swimming naked’.4  The tide began to turn at the beginning of 2007 in the US as  arrears and defaults in the sub-prime mortgage market began to rise. This led to a re- appraisal of risk as investors realised the probability of default had increased, given  the downturn in the housing market. At the same time, investors realised that the  complex and opaque nature of mortgage backed securities meant it would be very  difficult to judge where the risks lay. Hence, both risk and uncertainty rose together.     Greater cross-border asset holdings, and the risk-sharing between economies that  these holdings implied, meant that non-US based banks would also suffer profit losses  from the US sub-prime market. This became apparent in August 2007 as the French  bank BNP Paribas announced it was having difficulties in valuing many of its assets  because  the  markets  for  them  had  dried  up.  These  financial  market  linkages  complemented the greater level of trade integration which had occurred over the last  decade as trade barriers fell.     I will not attempt to give you a blow-by-blow account of the banking failures and  central bank and government interventions that have been necessary to prevent a  collapse  of  the  global  financial  system.  Many  commentators  have  attempted  to  characterise the credit crisis as a stream of unprecedented and unanticipated events  that  quickly  led  economic  prospects  to  deteriorate  dramatically.  But  this  view  misunderstands the problem. The first warning signs of the crisis began around the  beginning of 2007, and the full scale of the crisis began to be realised from August  2007 as markets for mortgage backed securities began to dry up. Economic conditions  became progressively worse through 2008.     The collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank certainly stands out as a key  moment during the most recent phase of the crisis. But once a realisation of the true  extent of balance sheet problems facing financial institutions began, coupled with the  knock-on effects on confidence and spending that such a realisation implied, the  global recession was always likely to intensify.                                                       4 Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway 2001, Chairman’s Letter.  5In his speech to the CBI in Leeds in October 2008, the Governor of the Bank of  England, Mervyn King described the problems in the financial sector prevailing at  that time.5     “Just as a fever is itself only a symptom of an underlying condition, so  the  freezing  of  interbank  and  money  markets  was  the  symptom  of  deeper structural problems in the banking sector.………Confidence in  the banking system had eroded as the weakness of the capital position  became more widely appreciated. But it took a crisis caused by the  failure of Lehman Brothers to trigger the coordinated government  plan to recapitalise the system. It would be a mistake, however, to  think that had Lehman Brothers not failed, a crisis would have been  averted. The underlying cause of inadequate capital would eventually  have provoked a crisis of one kind or another somewhere else.”    I agree. There is therefore little point in focussing on the scale of the Lehman Brothers  collapse and its inevitable consequences. Rather, we need to ask tough questions why  the structural problems within the financial sector were allowed to build up so that a  recapitalisation of the system was eventually required. Also, as the credit crunch  intensified  from  the  beginning  of  2007  onwards,  why  were  the  problems  not  recognised, with commensurate policy responses, before a full blown global financial  crisis was at hand? In doing so, we need to consider the conceptual framework driven  by current macroeconomic research that underpins monetary policy.     3. THE INTELLUCTUAL BASIS FOR MONETARY POLICY  As  a  monetary  policy  maker  I  have  found  the  ‘cutting  edge’  of  current  macroeconomic research totally inadequate in helping to resolve the problems we  currently face. I am far from alone in these views. To take a couple of observations:                                                        5 Speech by Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England to the CBI, Institute of Directors, Leeds  Chamber of Commerce and Yorkshire Forward at the Royal Armouries, Leeds, Tuesday 21st October  2008.  6“New classical and new Keynesian research has had little impact on  practical macroeconomists who are charged with the messy task of  conducting actual monetary and fiscal policy.”  Gregg Mankiw, 2006.6    “In  fact  “modern  macro”  has  been  notable  for  paying  very  little  rigorous attention to data. …... I am left with the feeling that there is  nothing in the empirical performance of these models that could come  close to overcoming a modest scepticism. And more certainly, there is  nothing to justify reliance on them for serious policy analysis.”   Nobel Laureate Robert Solow, 2008.7    “There is a danger that the macroeconomic models now in use in  central banks operate like a Maginot line. They have been constructed  in the past as part of the war against inflation. The central banks are  prepared to fight the last war. But are they prepared to fight the new  one against financial upheavals and recession? The macroeconomic  models they have today certainly do not provide them with the right  tools to be successful.”  Paul De Grauwe, 2008.8  and    “The widely used DSGE paradigm – designed to help control inflation  –  seems  ill  suited  to  understanding  the  origins  of  the  crisis  or  designing measures to solve it.”  Marcus Miller and Joseph Stiglitz, March 2009.9                                                      6 Mankiw, N.

I would like to  identify a number of shortcomings with the macroeconomic literature.    a) Efficient Markets and Random Shocks  The ‘efficient market hypothesis’ upon which most macroeconomic research is based  suggests that persistent mis-pricing of assets is highly unlikely. Bubbles in housing  and equity markets are assumed to be arbitraged away instantaneously rather than  persist and grow. There is no conditional probability within these models. That is,  imbalances may grow because of false assumptions or imperfect information within  markets, but eventually the true state of the economy will become apparent. The  longer the deviation from the equilibrium continues, the conditional probability of a  correction  in  the  next  period  towards  the  equilibrium  may  rise.  But  our  macroeconomic models have little to tell us when the tipping point may come.    In  a  recent  excellent  article  Willem  Buiter  describes  the  problems  with  modern  Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models.10 These models assume  close to or complete markets and information. Hence, the structure of these models is  akin to a centrally planned economy. In such a utopia there would be no disadvantage  in  allowing  a  social  planner  to  maximise  utility  for  society  as  a  whole.  A  de- centralised  economy  with  incomplete  markets  and  imperfect  information,  characterised  by  herding  behaviour  and  speculative  bubbles  is  a  far  better  approximation of the real world.     The other problem that Buiter describes is the linearity of the DSGE models:     “Those of us who have marvelled at the non-linear feedback loops  between asset prices in illiquid markets and the funding illiquidity of  financial institutions exposed to these asset prices through mark-to- market  accounting,  margin  requirements,  calls  for  additional  collateral  etc.  will  appreciate  what  is  lost  by  this  castration  of  macroeconomic  models.  Threshold  effects,  critical  mass,  tipping                                                    10 The unfortunate uselessness of most ‘state of the art’ academic monetary economics.   http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/03/the-unfortunate-uselessness-of-most-state-of-the-art-academic- monetary-economics/   8points, non-linear accelerators – they are all out the window. Those of  us  who  worry  about  endogenous  uncertainty  arising  from  the  interactions  of  boundedly  rational  market  participants  cannot  but  scratch  our  heads  at  the  insistence  of  mainline  models  that  all  uncertainty is exogenous and additive.”    So  are  economic  shocks  expected  to  be  random  and  temporary?  We  have  little  understanding of how imbalances build, propagate and eventually unwind and what  the  appropriate  policy  responses  should  be.  Another  problem  with  current  macroeconomic modelling is that it excludes a key part of our economy, the financial  sector. There is only one interest rate, the central bank policy rate. The deviation of  actual market interest rates around that policy rate is assumed away. Perhaps this is  another  reason  why  we  have  such  little  understanding  of  house  and  asset  price  bubbles.     Indeed, the efficient market hypothesis encouraged economists to search for structural  reasons to explain global imbalances and the asset price booms. Central banks were  lulled into a false sense of security by appealing arguments that linked apparently  sustainable movements in asset prices to structural reductions in the volatility of the  economy. In summary, modern macroeconomic research pointed policymakers in the  wrong direction.    b) Inflation Expectations, Credit and Money Supply  With no financial sector within macro models, there was little room to assess the  macroeconomic implications of financial instability. This may be one reason central  bankers were slow to realise the severity of the credit crunch until a full blown crisis  had emerged.     My colleague the Executive Director for Financial Stability at the Bank of England,  Andy Haldane has already provided an excellent critique of the risk management  modelling techniques that were employed by both banks and regulators to assess  financial stability concerns and which have been found to be wholly inadequate.11                                                    11 Haldane, A. ‘Why Banks failed the Stress Test’, Basis for a speech at the Marcus-Evans conference  on Stress Testing, 9-10 February 2009.  9Once more, the view that there had been a structural reduction in the volatility of the  economy may have contributed to complacency in assessing risk.     Many  monetary  policymakers  had  expressed  the  view  that  heightened  inflation  expectations  posed  the  risk  of  a  persistent  rise  in  CPI  inflation  if  they  became  entrenched. Hence, monetary policy might have to remain restrictive to contain this  danger. To my mind this argument is a confusion between cause and effect. Inflation  expectations  should  be  formed  by  credit  conditions,  the  supply  of  money  and  monetary policy, not vice versa. Once the credit crunch took hold a reduction in  inflationary pressure was always likely as the supply of credit contracted. Lower  inflation expectations would follow.     The New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) literature has been the workhorse model  for monetary theory in the past decade and stresses the role of inflation expectations.  However, we have recently experienced a sharp rise in survey measures of inflation  expectations, but without a persistent rise in inflationary pressure (Chart 3). One  explanation relates to the labour market. Although workers’ inflation expectations  were heightened over the recent past, they were unwilling to bargain for higher wages  at a time when labour market conditions were deteriorating and workers’ fear of  unemployment was rising sharply (Chart 4). And firms’ employment intentions were  falling back precisely because of the adverse effects on demand from the credit  crunch (Chart 5).     In the New Keynesian literature there is little discussion of how inflation expectations  feed into wage growth and how this relates to the unemployment rate in the economy.  Yet I fear policymakers drew inferences from the NKPC literature despite the lack of  a coherent labour market or credit market within this framework.     c) Microeconomic Phenomena   In attempting to understand asset price booms, there are potentially some fruitful  avenues of inquiry. George Soros holds that these fluctuations are predictable. And  given  his  profitable  record  in  financial  markets  who  are  we  to  doubt  him.  Furthermore, there are already a number of well established micro phenomena that  10may help to explain asset price booms which Andy Haldane has discussed in a recent  speech.12     The first of these is disaster myopia. That is, the tendency of people to place less  probability on extreme outcomes, as time goes by and the experience of these events  becomes more distant. Hence, investors, banks and policy makers underappreciated  the risks they were taking and the imbalances within the global economy as they  became ever more apparent. And as the last recession became more distant, the  premium investors demanded for risk fell.     The second micro phenomena, has been the principal-agent relationship between the  shareholders of banks, and their employees. It is debatable how much of the risk- taking was driven by shareholders or their employees. But it is certainly possible that  the remuneration structures within banks gave employees incentives to take large  risks.  Central  banks  have  an  interest  in  understanding  the  incentives  and  risk  preferences of the relatively small amount of people who channel our savings into  investments.    Whatever  incentive  structures  are  in  place  within  banks,  they  will  clearly  have  implications for overall financial stability. There is, however, a further principal-agent  problem.  That  is,  the  relationship  between  the  authority  responsible  for  overall  financial stability and the individual financial institutions. This problem has been  characterised as the difficulty of regulating financial institutions that are deemed ‘too  big to fail’ both by the public authorities and by the financial institutions themselves.  If so, such institutions will take bigger risks, confident they will be rescued by the  authorities in the event that their bets fail to come off.    All of these microeconomic phenomena have clear implications for the manner of  risk-taking in our economy. A better understanding of how investors both individually  and collectively price risk, and the macroeconomic implications of that price-setting  behaviour, would be a valuable tool for central bankers. It is important to remember                                                    12 Haldane, A. ‘Why Banks failed the Stress Test’, Basis for a speech at the Marcus-Evans conference  on Stress Testing, 9-10 February 2009.  11our lack of knowledge at a time when new regulations are being proposed to manage  the degree of risk-taking in the economy.        4.  WHAT  DOES  THIS  MEAN  FOR  THE  INFLATION  TARGETING  FRAMEWORK?    It  is  clear  that  the  intellectual  basis  for  inflation  targeting  has  been  called  into  question. The economic models that provided the rational for this approach do not  describe well the features of the global economy that led to the current crisis; the  build up of global imbalances, perceptions of risk in the economy and stresses within  the financial sector. Similarly, these economic models have been of little help in  formulating policy as the crisis has developed. There is now a consensus among  monetary policymakers that a new approach is required. An inflation targeting regime  alone will not suffice. For example, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), in which the  Bank  of  England  is  participating,  is  considering  the  use  of  macro-prudential  instruments to influence bank lending over the cycle.     Macro Prudential Tools    Macro-prudential tools would have been useful over the recent past. By limiting bank  lending they might even have helped to contain the global imbalances that were the  root cause of the crisis. However, providing central banks with new tools could be  uncharitably viewed as attempting to close the stable door after the horse has bolted.  Though such instruments may have been desirable in the past, it is very unlikely that  banks will take undue risks in their lending for the foreseeable future. Rather, the  immediate policy focus should be on how to stimulate lending by ensuring a healthy  financial sector.     Of course, macro-prudential instruments are intended to be symmetrical in nature, but  at the moment banks may be reluctant to lend given their expectation that capital  requirements will be stricter when the upturn finally comes. Hence, the costs and  benefits  of  placing  restrictions  on  bank  lending  will  be  least  favourable  in  the  12aftermath of a financial crisis. The current problem is that banks are risk averse. I  entirely agree with the sentiments of the Governor, Mervyn King expressed in his  speech last week that we need to take our time in deciding what measures to take.13 If  we close, bolt and lock the door shut we may find it harder to get the horse back into  the stable. Are we in danger of constructing a new Maginot line to fight the last battle  but not the next one?    How might these macro-prudential instruments work? One example would be to link  the required level of reserves held by commercial banks to macroeconomic variables  such as the GDP growth rate of the economy. This would restrict bank lending in the  good times so that banks had excess reserves during a downturn.     Such policies would have a clear interaction with more traditional instruments such as  the Bank Rate. In an inflation targeting regime central banks adjust the policy rate to  meet the inflation target in the medium term. The transmission of this process occurs  through the price of credit within money markets. So macro-prudential tools designed  to control the quantity of bank lending would interact, and potentially conflict with  inflation targeting regimes implemented through changes in the price of lending.     Consider the hypothetical example of a large expansion of the supply capacity of the  economy due to a shift outwards in the technological frontier. If macro-prudential  instruments were enforced, perhaps through an automatic link with the growth rate of  GDP, bank lending would be constrained in such a scenario. At the same time the  MPC might struggle to push up falling CPI inflation by reducing the Bank Rate. In  this case the macro-prudential and inflation targeting regimes would be in conflict.  Central  bankers  might  have  one  foot  on  the  accelerator,  whilst  simultaneously  applying the hand brake.    Indeed, the global economy experienced such a supply shock during the first half of  this decade as the growth of exports from low-cost economies pushed down on  consumer prices. Many central bankers expressed concern about the risks of deflation  around this time. But falling consumer prices, driven by a positive supply shock to the                                                    13 King, M. ‘Finance: A Return from Risk’, Speech to the Worshipful Company of International  Bankers at Mansion House in London on 17 March 2009.  13global economy, the integration of China into global trade, would have had very  different  implications  to  debt  deflation  driven  by  bursting  house  and  asset  price  bubbles.    Perhaps less expansionary monetary policies in the first half of the decade might have  led  to  falling  consumer  prices,  but  without  large  contractions  in  output  and  employment, and large increases in debt, house and asset prices.  If pursued, such  policies might even have led to more balanced global growth as the real appreciation  of China and emerging Asian economies would have been more pronounced. In  considering these arguments we should remember that in the medium term there can  be little trade off between inflation and growth.    Of course, the potential use of macro-prudential tools poses bigger questions about  the interaction of monetary policy and financial stability. If we are to adopt the use of  macro-prudential tools we must believe there is some difference in the transmission  mechanism to the economy from measures that affect the price or quantity of bank  lending? If not, then central banks need only assess the overall stance of monetary  conditions. It could be that there is no one target or tool that is optimal for monetary  policymakers to consider at all times. Rather, a more nuanced approach may be  necessary to achieve balanced growth, stable inflation and at the same time avoid  financial crises.     Should we lean against the wind?    It  may  be  that  there  is  little  difference  in  the  transmission  mechanism  between  controls on the price and quantity of bank lending (at least in normal times when  Bank Rate is not close to the nominal zero bound). And it will always be very difficult  for  central  banks  to  influence  investors’  herd-like  perceptions  of  risk.  As  these  perceptions of risk change over time it is likely that asset price bubbles will continue  to occur, despite constraints on bank lending.     So should central banks ‘lean against the wind’ when asset prices appear to rise  unsustainably? I agree with my colleague Sir John Gieve that central banks may need  14to consider such a course.14  In doing so, central banks will need to take action when  asset prices appear to rise unsustainably over a prolonged period. At the same time, it  is probably unrealistic to expect equity prices to be included in some explicit target,  given their volatility.     However, I do agree that house prices should be included in the target the MPC  considers. House prices are the most important asset for many households as it is the  price of their home that they secure their mortgage lending against. As house prices  rose, UK households were able to secure ever more favourable mortgages as their  loan-to-value (LTV) ratios fell. Now that house prices are falling, banks are unwilling  to lend so favourably given the risk of losses from those households close to, are  already in, negative equity.     I believe there is a broad consensus that it would be better to include house prices  within the CPI index. The main difficulty appears to be agreeing a pan-European  measure of housing costs that can be consistently applied across the EU. However,  this does not preclude changing the target back to RPIX, the measure of inflation the  MPC had targeted and which includes a measure of housing costs.     So what does all this mean for the future of monetary policy? I certainly haven’t  provided all the answers but at least I’ve posed some questions, and come to a few  modest conclusions. First, I believe central banks require additional tools such as  macro-prudential instruments. Essentially this implies a more nuanced and less target  driven approach to monetary policy. Second, central bankers will have to consider  house and asset prices, rather than measures of consumer price inflation alone, and  judge whether current levels are sustainable. Third, central bankers need to recognise  that monetary policy cannot affect growth in the medium term. Stable growth in  lending and money supply, however hard they are to measure, are our ultimate goal.     5. THE CURRENT OUTLOOK FOR MONETARY POLICY                                                      14 Gieve, Sir John. ‘Seven Lessons from The Last Three Years’, Speech at the London School of  Economics, February 19th 2009.  15The immediate macroeconomic policy questions concern stimulating lending in the  UK economy within dysfunctional money markets. The Bank Rate has now been cut  to close to the zero nominal bound, the MPC has voted for asset purchases of £75bn  to help provide liquidity to money markets and the government has announced a  range of measures to support the financial system.     In short, a large part of our financial infrastructure remains dysfunctional because of  the difficulties in valuing complex assets and derivatives, for which there is little  investor appetite as a re-appraisal of risk takes place within the global economy. That  these assets remain on banks’ balance sheets has increased uncertainty about our  banks’ capital adequacy and remains a barrier to private investment.    The most important measure to address this problem is the Asset Protection Scheme.  This scheme is designed to protect banks from future losses from their holdings of  assets that are currently difficult to price due to illiquid markets. At the same time  those banks that participate in the scheme will commit to increase their lending to UK  firms and households. I certainly hope these measures will work and allow the UK  economy to gradually recover. However, the risks of a protracted recession are clearly  evident. It may take longer than expected for policy initiatives to restore more normal  lending conditions in financial markets. Additional policy initiatives may be required  if conditions continue to deteriorate within the financial sector. A range of solutions  have been proposed to solve this problem in other economies. For example, public  purchases of ‘troubled’ assets, the creation of a ‘bad bank’ to purchase ‘troubled’  assets from financial institutions and finally outright nationalisation of banks.    A risk to the economic outlook relates to the rising level of unemployment in the  economy. As redundancies rise and house prices fall, more British households will  face the grim prospect of experiencing both unemployment and negative equity in  their homes. Forced selling in the housing market could lead to further downward  pressure on house prices, pushing more households into negative equity. In this case  mortgage arrears and defaults will rise, putting further pressure on the financial sector.     For these reasons I have argued that any fiscal stimulus that is being planned should  be concentrated on maintaining employment and sustaining labour demand, perhaps  16through expansions of public sector employment where appropriate. I outlined some  policy options to deal with the rising level of unemployment in my last speech in  Stirling in February.15 It is particularly important to target the young because long  spells of unemployment while young cause permanent scars rather than the temporary  blemishes that occur for older workers who already have a foothold in the labour  market.    Dis-inflationary pressure within the UK economy is now clearly evident. Though the  annual rate may be volatile in the months ahead, CPI inflation has fallen sharply from  its peak in September. RPI inflation has now fallen to close to zero. At the same time  conditions in the labour market continue to weaken. The claimant count this month  increased by a record amount of 138,000. Many firms are reporting wage freezes as  economic activity continues to contract, and unemployment and redundancies rise.  There is even talk of wage cuts. So an accommodative monetary policy stance is  likely for the foreseeable future.    6. CONCLUSIONS    The credit crisis has already been a painful experience. And most of the pain will be  felt this year as redundancies and unemployment rise. Going forward the medium  term prospects for the UK will remain reliant on ensuring a healthy financial sector.     The intellectual basis for inflation targeting that had existed has been called into  question. There is a consensus that central banks require additional tools to address  the problems that can occur in financial markets and that inflation targeting was an  insufficient policy tool in the past. However, we do not possess a coherent intellectual  framework to assess what form such macro-prudential instruments might take, how  we would use them, and how they would interact with traditional monetary policy  instruments such as the Bank Rate.     We should not be overly ambitious. We cannot and should not expect to abolish the  economic  cycle.

Given the premise  of modern macroeconomic research that financial crises are unlikely we are poorly  prepared to make this judgement. No one individual can answer these questions so we  need to consider a range of views. And in the midst of the recession we should be  wary of the reflex reaction to over regulate, which could be counterproductive in  allowing the economy to eventually recover.     These questions pose severe challenges for academic economists which I hope they  will rise to answer. However, a new approach within macroeconomic research will be  required, grounded in the realities of the data and the world around us rather than as  an enterprise in theory. As Larry Summers has said,16     “progress is unlikely as long as macroeconomists require the armor  of a stochastic pseudo-world before doing battle with evidence from  the real one.”    Sadly, the scars from past battles within the academic economics community may be  too deep to heal. It may be that a new generation of economists, unimpeded by past  dogmas and orthodoxy is required to bring common sense back to macroeconomics. I  hope we are intellectually honest enough to move on and accept new ways of thinking  and frameworks for economic policy. Monetary policy and financial stability are too  important.                                                         16 Summers. L.H.
