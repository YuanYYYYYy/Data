The majority of countries in Europe today have lower  unemployment than any OECD country outside Europe, including the US.  These two  facts are consistent because the four largest countries in Continental Western Europe  namely, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, (the Big Four), have very high unemployment  and most of the rest have comparatively low unemployment.  This variability is highly  informative because the fifteen European countries which we consider have more or  less  independent  labour  markets  in  practice,  despite  “free”  movement  of  labour.   Using this information we see how changes in the structure of the various labour  markets explain a substantial proportion of the secular fluctuations in unemployment  in the various countries.  In particular, we pin down some of the particular factors  which enable us to understand why some European countries have been able fully to  recover from the unemployment disasters of the early 1980s whereas some have not.    JEL Classification:  J64  Keywords:  unemployment, institutions1.  Introduction  The average unemployment rate in Europe in 2001 was 7.6%.  This is higher  than in any of the developed countries of the OECD outside Europe1.  Interestingly,  the inactivity rate in Europe has exactly the same property.  So, in this average sense,  there is a European unemployment problem.  But averaging in this way is silly.   Europe, by which we mean Western Europe, consists of fifteen countries (we omit  Luxembourg) with fifteen more or less independent labour markets.  As we shall see,  it is how these labour markets operate which determines unemployment over the  longer term.  And by 2002, nine of these fifteen labour markets were operating well  enough to produce unemployment rates lower than in any of the non-European  developed OECD countries including the US.  So why is average unemployment in  Europe so high?  The answer is that unemployment is high in the four largest  economies of Continental Western Europe, namely France, Germany, Italy and Spain.   Exclude these four countries and the famous European unemployment problem more  or less disappears.  In what follows, we pursue these issues.  In the next section, we present an  overview of labour supply in the developed OECD countries simply to set the scene  for our analysis of unemployment.  Then in Section 3, we discuss how we might  explain large secular shifts in unemployment and the circumstances in which changes  in the operation of the labour market would provide such an explanation.  In Section 4  we discuss which labour market institutions might be expected to relate to  unemployment over the longer term and then, in Section 5, we summarise some of the  evidence on this issue.  Finally, in Section 6, we look at what has actually happened to  labour market institutions in the last four decades in our group of OECD countries.   Then we see whether we can explain the significant differences in unemployment  performance across Europe since the early 1980s.  2.  An Overall picture of Labour Supply    Although we shall be concentrating on unemployment in what follows, it is  helpful to look at some more general background information on various aspects of  Table 1 here  labour supply.  In Table 1, we present the aggregate picture in 2001 and 2002.  Taking  the very latest unemployment data, the first striking point, which we have already  noted, that there is not a European unemployment problem.  Most European  economies have lower levels of unemployment than the OECD countries outside  Europe including the United States.  The problem lies in the large countries of    1Continental Western Europe, namely France, Germany, Italy, Spain, henceforward  referred to as the Big Four.  Of the other eleven countries of Western Europe in the  table, nine currently have relatively low unemployment2, the exceptions being  Belgium and Finland.  By and large, the European countries with high unemployment  rates tend to have high inactivity rates and low employment rates as well.  The Big  Four and Belgium all have employment rates below 66 per cent with only Ireland of  the rest joining this group.  With the exception of Germany, the Big Four, Belgium  and Ireland also have inactivity rates in excess of 30 per cent.    A second point worth noting is the pattern of long-term unemployment rates    Table 2 here  (over 12 months), set out in Table 2.  Here we see that while the short-term  unemployment rate in the European Union is relatively low at 4.3%, the long-term  rate far exceeds that outside Europe.  The Big Four and Belgium all have long-term  unemployment rates between 3% and 6%, many times the equivalent rates of the non- European countries.  High long-term rates obviously reflect barriers to re-entry into  the job market, once having lost a job.    In Tables 3 and 4, we present unemployment, inactivity and employment rates   Table 3 here  for a variety of sub-groups of the working age population to illustrate the wide  variations in the patterns across age and gender groupings.  Focussing first on prime  age men (age 25-54), we see that even among this group, in most countries more are  inactive than are unemployed.  Furthermore, the inactivity rate in this group is higher  in the US than in the European Union.  Interestingly, most inactive men in this age  group are classified as sick or disabled, the majority of whom are claiming some form  Table 4 here  of state benefit.  Furthermore, the size of this disability group has risen substantially  since the 1970s in nearly every country, and in those which have been analysed, this  increase has been driven by changes in the entry rules and the available benefits (see  Bound and Burkhauser, 1999, for some evidence).  Among older men, unemployment rates are generally much the same as for  prime age men, but inactivity rates are enormously larger and vary dramatically from  one country to another.  In some European countries, more than  half the older men  are inactive, whereas in Norway and Sweden, the inactivity rate is closer to one  quarter.  As Blondal and Scarpetta (1998) note, these large cross-country variations  were not apparent as recently as 1971, when nearly all the countries had inactivity  rates for this group below 20 per cent, the major exception being Italy with a rate of  41 per cent, (see Blondal and Scarpetta, 1998, Table V.1, p.72).  The main factor    2explaining the current variations and the consequent large changes since 1971 has  been the structure of the social security system.  Incentives for men to stay in the  labour force vary widely, with generous incentives to retire early being introduced in  many countries.  This was often done in order to reduce labour supply in the mistaken  view that this would help to resolve the problem of unemployment.  As a  consequence, with the exception of Spain, all of the Big Four and Belgium have  exceptionally high inactivity rates among older men on top of their exceptionally high  unemployment rates.  Inactivity rates among women aged 25 to 54 also vary widely, with the  Scandinavian countries having the lowest rates in the OECD, and Italy and Spain  having the highest.  While the majority of inactive women in this age group report  themselves as looking after their family, Italy and Spain also have the lowest fertility  rates in the OECD.  What is important here is the structure of the tax system,  particularly the marginal tax rate facing wives when their husbands work3, and the  existence of barriers to part-time work.  Finally, it is worth noting how unemployment in Italy, Spain and to a lesser  extent France is heavily concentrated among young people and women.  This is partly  due to the role of employment protection laws in generating barriers to employment  for new entrants and partly due to the social mores surrounding entry into work.  For  example, in Italy many young people, particularly if they are well qualified, will live  at home for many years without working but effectively queuing for a particularly  desirable job and contributing to measured unemployment (although perhaps not to  true unemployment).  Overall, therefore, it is clear that the unemployed are not the only relevant  group when it comes to analysing labour supply.  Indeed, it is generally the case that  there are significant flows into employment from the inactive which are, in many  countries, as large as the flows from unemployment.  But there are many more  inactive than unemployed, so the probability per period that an unemployed person  gets a job is generally several times higher than the probability per period that an  inactive person gets a job.  Thus the unemployed are the significant group of potential  suppliers of labour since they are the group who are actively searching for and  obtaining work at a substantial rate.  So, in the remainder of what follows, this is the  group on which we shall focus.  3.  Explaining Secular Shifts in Unemployment    3Before discussing how we might explain why unemployment changes such a  lot over time, we start with a general picture of the period from 1960 presented in  Table 5.  Note that in this table, the numbers for Germany refer to West Germany and  the numbers for Italy have been subject to some correction described in the table.   Both these changes have been made to try and ensure some degree of consistency  over time.  Looking at the table, we see that unemployment was very low in the 1960s  with the notable exceptions of Canada, Ireland and the United States.  Today, there is  only one country with unemployment lower than in the early 1960s, namely Ireland,  although Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and the US have seen very small  increases over what were very low levels in the case of the first four countries.  By  contrast, the Big Four have unemployment today far in excess of its level in the early  1960s.  Like most countries, their unemployment rates took off in the late 1970s and  early 1980s but unusually they have remained high ever since.  Thse patterns are the  main focus of our interest, so how might this be explained?  Some Basic Analysis  The level of employment, and hence unemployment, is determined by  aggregate demand5.  This is influenced by many factors, mostly outside the direct  control of policy makers.  Monetary policy is, however, directly controlled by policy  makers and has a significant impact on aggregate demand.  These days, monetary  policy tends to be set in order to stabilise inflation at relatively low levels.  Suppose,  as a result of adverse shocks, aggregate demand is low, unemployment is high and the  economy is in a recession.  Then monetary policy will be loosened, aggregate demand  will recover and unemployment will start falling.  At some point in this recovery, the  economy will run into labour shortages and inflationary pressure.  In anticipation of  inflation moving above target, monetary policy is then tightened.  They key issue is  how much unemployment remains before labour shortages become excessive and  inflation starts to rise.  This level of unemployment may be thought of as the  equilibrium or sustainable rate at which there is no systematic tendency for inflation  to rise or fall, (so it is also called the NAIRU).    By and large, variations in this equilibrium rate of unemployment, through  Table 5 here  time and across countries, will lie behind the broad patterns of unemployment we  observe in Table 5.  So explaining the equilibrium rate is the key problem.  Of course,  aggregate demand determines unemployment, so variations in aggregate demand  (relative to trend) will  “explain” precisely the observed patterns of unemployment.     4But this is more of a tautology than an explanation.  A country will suffer from  persistently high unemployment, that is persistently “low” aggregate demand, if its  equilibrium level of unemployment is high.  Because then, any attempt to raise  aggregate demand and hence lower unemployment will run into the inflation  constraint.  For example, in the UK in the late 1980s, aggregate demand rose rapidly  from 1986 and unemployment fell from 11.2% in that year to 8.6% in 1988 and 7.2%  in 1989.  Unfortunately, over the same period retail price inflation rose from 3.4% in  1986 to 4.9% in 1988 and 7.8% in 1989.  Monetary policy was tightened dramatically  and the short-term interest rate rose from around 8 per cent in the spring of 1988 to 15  per cent by the winter of 1989.  Unemployment increased from its low point of 6.9%  in 1990 to a high of 10.2% in 1993 as the direct consequence of this monetary  tightening.  It is clear from these data that equilibrium unemployment must have been  well above the 1990 low point because inflation was rising quite rapidly well before  this point was reached.  By contrast, in the late 1990s, UK unemployment fell well  below this 1990 low point with no inflationary consequences whatever, suggesting a  significant decline in equilibrium unemployment.    A second interesting example is the Eurozone in the late 1990s.  The Eurozone  Table 6 here  is, of course, dominated in size by the big four Continental European economies,  France, Germany, Italy and Spain.  A picture of events for 1994-2002 is set out in  Table 6.  As a general rule of thumb, monetary policy, as captured by short-term  interest rates, impacts on demand with a lag of about a year and on inflation in a  further year.  Early in the period, monetary policy was quite tight, domestic demand  growth was relatively modest, unemployment was nearly 11% and the inflation rate  was falling.  Monetary policy was eased during the late 1990s, domestic demand  growth expanded and unemployment started falling.  However, by early 2000,  inflation had started to move above the ECB target range6 even though unemployment  was still above 8%.  As a consequence, monetary policy was tightened throughout  2000.  Despite subsequent easing, particularly in late 2001, domestic demand fell  rapidly from the second half of 2000 and unemployment started to rise from a low  point of 7.8% in late 20017.  Despite this, inflation remains above the ECB target  range.  The lesson from this episode appears to be that in the Eurozone, the reduction  in unemployment generated by monetary policy easing in the late 1990s hit the  inflation constraint in 2000 and monetary policy had to be tightened to stop inflation  rising further.  This prevented Eurozone unemployment falling much below 8%.  On    5the basis of this example, it is hard to see how average equilibrium unemployment in  the Eurozone can be below 8%, a relatively high level, particularly as unemployment  in most of the small Eurozone countries has been well below this level for many  years.  Can Unemployment Deviate from its Equilibrium Level for Long Periods?  These are typical examples of how actual unemployment fluctuates around its  equilibrium level.  But it is not always like this.  On some occasions, countries may  suffer from high levels of unemployment for long periods of time either because they  experience an overwhelming adverse demand shock from which it takes a very long  time to recover or because macroeconomic policy is persistently perverse.  In the  former case, we may observe unemployment well above its equilibrium rate, although  falling back towards it.  In this case inflation may not fall, although unemployment is  above its equilibrium rate, because the very fact that unemployment is falling will  itself typically generate upward inflationary pressure.  This offsets the downward  inflationary pressure produced by the high level of unemployment8.  In the latter case,  unemployment which is kept above its equilibrium rate will tend simply to generate  falling inflation.  Good examples of these two cases are provided by Finland and  Japan.  In Finland, a combination of poor policy decisions including a mishandled  deregulation of the financial sector produced a huge adverse demand shock in the  early 1990s which was reinforced by the collapse of trade with the Soviet Union.   Consequently, as we can see in Table 7, unemployment rose from 3.2% to 16.4% in  three years.  From 1994 onwards, unemployment has fallen steadily without any  serious inflationary consequences.  This is a good example of unemployment being  above the equilibrium rate for a decade but steadily falling back, simply as the  consequence of an enormous adverse demand shock.    The example of Japan is different.  From 1990 on, unemployment has been  Table 7 here  rising throughout and, with a brief hiccup, inflation has been falling, turning negative  in 1999.  This suggests that unemployment has been above the equilibrium rate for a  long time which equally suggests that something has gone wrong on the macro policy  front.    Aside from these types of exceptions, the longer-term patterns of  unemployment tend to be dominated by shifts in the equilibrium rate.  One way of  checking on this is to look at two groups of European countries.  In the first group are  France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Big Four.  In the second group are Denmark,    6Netherlands and the UK.  From Table 5, we see that unemployment in the period  1973-79 was much the same in all these countries.  Then in the 1980s unemployment  rose substantially, again in all these countries.  But by 2000-01, unemployment in the  Big Four remained around twice as high as in the 1973-79 period.  By contrast, in the  second group, unemployment was roughly the same in 2000-01 as in 1973-79.  This  suggests that equilibrium unemployment is much higher today in the Big Four than it  was in 1973-79 whereas, in the second group, equilibrium unemployment is today at  roughly the same level as in the 1970s.  We can see this clearly by looking at the  relationship between unemployment and vacancies (the Beveridge Curve).  When  vacancies are high, unemployment should be relatively low, because it is easy for  unemployed people to find work.  Yet, strikingly, in France, West Germany and Spain  vacancies in recent years have been extremely high by historical standards, despite  high unemployment.  (There are no vacancy data for Italy.)  It is this high level of  vacancies which helped to generate increasing European inflation in 1999/2000,  which led to higher interest rates and the end of the European recovery, as we have  already noted.  This situation is shown in Figure 1.  In all three countries vacancies in  2000/1 were far higher than in the late 1970s.  One might have expected  unemployment in 2000/1 to be lower.  But, in fact, it was more than double, as we  have already noted.    In the second group of countries shown in Figure 2, we see that just as in the  Fig. 2 here  first group, unemployment rose significantly relative to vacancies in the 1980s.  But,  in the 1990s, in contrast to the Big Four, there was a backward shift in unemployment  relative to vacancies so that by the end of the 1990s, the unemployment/vacancy loci  were back at their 1975 positions.  So on the basis of these arguments, we may conclude that, aside from some  notable exceptions, the secular shifts in unemployment which we have seen are driven  by shifts in the equilibrium rate, the major exceptions in the 1990s being Finland and  Japan.  So the next step is to discuss the factors which impact on the equilibrium  unemployment rate.  4.  The Determinants of the Equilibrium Rate  There are innumerable detailed theories of unemployment in the long run.   These may be divided into two broad groups, those based on flow models and those  based on stock models.  Pissarides (1990) and Mortensen and Pissarides (1999)  provide good surveys of the former model type.  Blanchard and Katz (1999) presents    7a general template for the latter models.  Fundamentally, all the models have the same  broad implications. The equilibrium level of unemployment is affected first, by any  variable which influences the ease with which unemployed individuals can be  matched to available job vacancies, and second, by any variable which tends to raise  wages in a direct fashion despite excess supply in the labour market.  There may be  variables common to both sets.  Finally, both groups of variables will tend to impact  on real wages in the same direction as they influence equilibrium unemployment,  essentially because equilibrium labour demand, which is negatively related to wages,  has to move in the opposite direction to equilibrium unemployment.  Before going on to consider these variables in more detail, it is worth noting  that the first group of variables mentioned above will tend to impact on the position of  the unemployment/vacancy locus or Beveridge Curve, whereas the second will not do  so in any direct fashion.  However, this division is not quite as clear cut as it might  appear at first sight (see below).  What we can say, nevertheless is that any variable  which shifts the Beveridge Curve to the right will increase equilibrium  unemployment.  So a shift of the Beveridge Curve is a sufficient but not necessary  sign that equilibrium unemployment has changed.  We turn now to consider a series of variables which we might expect to  influence equilibrium unemployment either because of their impact on the  effectiveness with which the unemployed are matched to available jobs or because of  their direct effect on wages.  The unemployment benefit system directly affects the  readiness of the unemployed to fill vacancies.  Aspects of the system which are  clearly important are the level of benefits, their coverage, the length of time for which  they are available and the strictness with which the system is operated.  Related to  unemployment benefits is the availability of other resources to those without jobs.   These include the returns on non-human wealth which may be increasing in the real  interest rate.  (see Phelps, 1994, for an extensive discussion).  Employment protection  laws may tend to make firms more cautious about filling vacancies which slows the  speed at which the unemployed move into work.  This obviously reduces the  efficiency of job matching.  However, the mechanism here is not clear-cut.  For  example, the introduction of employment laws often leads to an increased  professionalisation of the personnel function within firms, as was the case in Britain  in the 1970s (see Daniel and Stilgoe, 1978).  This can increase the efficiency of job  matching.  So, in terms of outflows from unemployment, the impact of employment    8protection laws can go either way.  By contrast, it seems clear that such laws will tend  to reduce involuntary separations and hence lower inflows into unemployment.  So  the overall impact on the Beveridge Curve and hence on unemployment is an  empirical question.  Furthermore, employment law may also have a direct impact on  pay since it raises the job security of existing employees encouraging them to demand  higher pay increases.  Anything which makes it easier to match the unemployed to the available  vacancies will shift the Beveridge Curve to the left and reduce equilibrium  unemployment.  Factors which operate in this way include the reduction of barriers to  mobility which may be geographical or occupational.  Furthermore numerous  government policies are concerned to increase the ability and willingness of the  unemployed to take jobs.  These are grouped under the heading of active labour  market policies.  Turning now to those factors which have a direct impact on wages, the  obvious place to start is the institutional structure of wage determination.  Within  every country there is a variety of structures.  In some sectors wages are determined  more of less competitively but in others wages are bargained between employers and  trade unions at the level of the establishment, firm or even industry.  The overall  outcome depends on union power in wage bargains, union coverage and the degree of  co-ordination of wage bargains.  Generally, greater union power and coverage can be  expected to exert upward pressure on wages, hence raising equilibrium  unemployment, but this can be offset if union wage setting across the economy is co- ordinated.    The final group of variables which directly impacts on wages falls under the  heading of real wage resistance.  The idea here is that workers attempt to sustain  recent rates of real wage growth when the rate consistent with stable employment  shifts unexpectedly.  For example, if there is an adverse shift in the terms of trade, real  consumption wages must fall if employment is not to decline.  If workers persist in  attempting to bargain for rates of real wage growth which take no account of the  movement in the terms of trade, this will tend to raise unemployment.  Exactly the  same argument applies if there is an unexpected fall in trend productivity growth or an  increase in labour taxes.  For example, if labour taxes (payroll tax rates plus income  tax rates plus consumption tax rates) go up, the real post-tax consumption wage must  fall if real labour costs per employee facing firms are not to rise.  Any resistance to    9this fall will lead to a rise in unemployment.  This argument suggests that increases in  real import prices, falls in trend productivity growth or rises in the labour tax rate may  lead to a temporary increase in unemployment.  However, it may be argued that changes in labour taxes may have a permanent  impact on unemployment depending on the extent to which the taxes are shifted onto  labour.  A key issue here is the extent to which benefits or the value of leisure adjust  in proportion to post-tax earnings (see Pissarides 1998, for example).  To summarise, the variables which we might expect to influence equilibrium  unemployment include the unemployment benefit system, the real interest rate,  employment protection laws, barriers to labour mobility, active labour market  policies, union structures and the extent of co-ordination in wage bargaining, labour  taxes, and unexpected shifts in the terms of trade and trend productivity growth.  So  the interesting question is, to what extent can we explain the secular shifts in  unemployment by changes in the, mainly institutional, variables noted above?   5.  Labour Market Institutions and Unemployment Patterns  The purpose of this section is to consider whether it has proved possible to  explain the unemployment patterns shown in Table 5 by variations over time and  across countries in the sort of labour market institutions discussed in the previous  section.  Cross-country variation in post-1980s unemployment is easy enough to  explain by cross-country variation in labour market institutions (see, for example,  Layard et al., 1991, p.55;  Scarpetta, 1996;  Nickell, 1997, Elmeskov et al., 1998;   Nickell and Layard 1999).  More interesting and more tricky is to explain the time  series variation from the 1960s onward.  There are several different approaches that have been used.  First there is a  basic division between studies that use econometric techniques to fit the data and  those which use calibrated models which typically distinguish between a stylised  “European” economy and a stylised “United States” economy.  Second there is  another division between those which focus on changes in the institutions and those  which consider “shocks” or baseline factors which shift over time and are typically  interacted with average levels of institutional factors:  Looking first at panel data econometric models which interact stable  institutions with shocks or baseline variables, good examples include Layard et al.  (1991), Chapter 9 (p. 430-37), Blanchard and Wolfers (2000), Bertola et al. (2001)  and Fitoussi et al. (2000).  All these focus on the time series variation in the data by    10including country dummies.  Layard et al. (1991) present a dynamic model of  unemployment based on annual data where the baseline variables include wage  pressure (a dummy which takes the value one from 1970), the benefit replacement  ratio, real import price changes and monetary shocks.  Their impact on unemployment  differs across countries, since it depends on time invariant institutions, with different  sets of institutions affecting the degree of unemployment persistence, the impact of  wage pressure variables including the replacement rate and import prices, and the  effect of monetary shocks.  The model explains the data better than individual country  autoregressions with trends.  Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) use five year averages to concentrate on long- run effects.  The shocks or baseline variables consist of the level of TFP growth, the  real interest rate, the change in inflation and labour demand shifts (essentially the log  of labour’s share purged of the impact of factor prices).  With the exception of the  change in inflation, these “shocks” are not mean reverting which is why we prefer the  term baseline variables.  These variables are driving unemployment, so that, for  example, the fact that annual TFP growth is considerably higher in the 1960s than in  the 1990s in most countries is an important reason why unemployment is typically  higher in the latter period.  Quite why this should be so is not wholly clear.  Many  mechanisms are discussed in Saint-Paul (1991) but there is no evidence that they are  important or robust in Bean and Pissarides (1993) for example.  Nevertheless,  interacting these observed baseline variables with time invariant institutional variables  fits the data well.  In an alternative investigation, Blanchard and Wolfers replace the  observed shock variables with unobserved common shocks represented by time  dummies.  When these are interacted with time invariant institutions, the explanatory  power of the model increases substantially.  The basic Blanchard and Wolfers model is extended in Bertola et al. (2001)  who include an additional baseline variable, namely the share of young people (age  15-24) in the population over 15 years old.  The model explains a substantial  proportion of the divergence between US and other countries unemployment rates (48  to 63 percent) over the period 1970 to 1995, although an even higher proportion is  explained when the observed baseline variables are replaced by time dummies.  Fitoussi et al. (2000) proceed in a slightly different way.  First they interact the  baseline variables with country dummies and then investigate the cross-section  relationship between these and labour market institutions.  The baseline variables    11include non-wage support (income from private wealth plus social spending) relative  to labour productivity and the real price of oil as well as two in common with  Blanchard and Wolfers (2000), namely the real rate of interest and productivity  growth.  In all these four papers, the explanation of long-run changes in  unemployment has the same structure.  The changes depend on long-run shifts in a set  of baseline variables, with the impact of these being much bigger and longer-lasting in  some countries than others because of stable institutional differences.  The  persuasiveness of these explanations depends on whether the stories associated with  the baseline variables are convincing.  For example, the notion that a fall in trend  productivity growth, a rise in the real price of oil or a downward shift in the labour  demand curve leads to a permanent rise in equilibrium unemployment in one which  many might find unappealing.  An interesting alternative, still in the context of the institutions/shocks  framework is the calibration analysis discussed in Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998).   The idea here is that in “Europe”, benefits are high with a long duration of eligibility  whereas in the “United States”, benefits are modest and of fixed duration.  In a world  where turbulence is low, the probability of large skill losses among the unemployed is  low and the difference in the unemployment rates in “Europe” and the “United States”  is minimal, because the chances of an unemployed person in “Europe” finding a job  with wages exceeding the benefit level are high.  In a world where turbulence is high,  the probability of large skill losses among the unemployed is high.  As a consequence  the high level of benefits relative to past earnings and hence the high reservation wage  in “Europe” now bites and unemployment is much higher than in the “United States”.   So we have a situation where the relevant institution, namely the benefit system,  remains stable but the consequences are very different in a world of high turbulence  from those in a world of low turbulence.  While this model captures a particular feature of the situation, in order for it to  be a persuasive explanation of recent history it must pass two tests.  First, we need  evidence that turbulence has indeed increased and second it must explain why many  countries in Europe now have relatively low unemployment.  Indeed the variation in  unemployment (and employment) rates across European countries is far larger than  the difference between Europe and the United States.  To justify the assumption of  increasing turbulence, Ljungqvist and Sargent point to the increasing variance of  transitory earnings in the United States reported by Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994).     12There has also been a rise in the transitory variance in the UK, noted by Dickens  (2000).  However these facts hardly add up to a full empirical test of the theory.  For  example, in Europe, TFP growth has been much lower since 1976 than it was in the  earlier period and we might expect TFP growth to be positively associated with  turbulence.  Indeed, the fall in TFP growth is one of the main factors generating a rise  in unemployment in Blanchard and Wolfers (2000).  Furthermore, there is no  evidence of any significant changes in the rates of job creation and job destruction  over the relevant period (see Davis and Haltiwanger, 1999).  Finally, no evidence is  presented which explains why the various European countries have such widely  differing unemployment patterns.  So while the Lungqvist/Sargent model may capture  an element of the story, it hardly comes close to a full explanation.  Turning now to studies which simply rely on changing institutions to explain  unemployment patterns, notable examples include Belot and Van Ours (2000, 2001)  and Nickell et al. (2002).  The former papers provide a good explanation of changes in  unemployment in eighteen OECD countries, although in order to do so they make  extensive use of interactions between institutions, something which has a sound  theoretical foundation (see Coe and Snower, 1997, for example).  Their model is,  however, static like that of Blanchard and Wolfers.  The model developed by Nickell  et al. (2002) uses annual data and since they explain actual unemployment, they  include in their model those factors which might explain the short-run deviations of  unemployment from its equilibrium level.  Following the discussion in Hoon and  Phelps (1992) or Phelps (1994) these factors include aggregate demand shocks,  productivity shocks and wage shocks.  More specifically, they include the following:  i)  money supply shocks, specifically changes in the rate of growth of the  nominal money stock (i.e. the second difference of the log money supply);  ii)  productivity shocks, measured by changes in TFP growth or deviations of TFP  growth from trend;  iii)  labour demand shocks, measured by the residuals from a simple labour  demand model;  iv)  real import price shocks, measured by proportional changes in real import  prices weighted by the trade share;  v)  the (ex-post) real interest rate.  With the exception of the real interest rate, these variables are genuine  “shocks” in the sense that they are typically stationary and tend to revert to their mean  quite rapidly.  This distinguishes them from the “baseline variables” used in  Blanchard and Wolfers (2000), for example.  On top of these variables, Nickell et al.    13(2002) then use such time series of the institutional variables as are available  including employment protection, the benefit replacement rate, benefit duration, union  density, co-ordination and employment taxes.  These variables are there to explain  equilibrium unemployment.  Using a dynamic panel data model, the time series  patterns of unemployment are well explained.  Based on dynamic simulations keeping  institutions fixed at their 1960s values, it is found that the institutional variables which  are included explain about 55 per cent of the individual country changes in  unemployment from the 1960s to the early 1990s.  This is reasonable, particularly as  the early 1990s was a period of deep recession in much of Europe.  Overall, therefore, there is some evidence that the sort of labour market  institutions discussed in the previous section made a significant contribution to  explaining the patterns of unemployment reported in Table 5.  So, as a final step, let  us see how these institutional variables have changed over time and what these  changes can tell us about why the European Big Four countries have performed less  well than most other countries on the unemployment front in the 1990s.   6.  Changes in Labour Market Institutions and their Impact  In this section we look at changes in benefit systems, wage determination,  employment protection and labour taxes in the last decades of the 20th Century and  see what they can tell us.  The Unemployment Benefit System    There are four aspects of the unemployment benefit system for which there are  good theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that they will influence equilibrium  unemployment.  These are, in turn, the level of benefits9 , the duration of  entitlement10, the coverage of the system11 and the strictness with which the system is  operated12.  Of these, only the first two are available as time series for the OECD  countries.  The OECD has collected systematic data on the unemployment benefit  replacement ratio for three different family types (single, with dependent spouse, with  spouse at work) in three different duration categories (1st year, 2nd and 3rd years, 4th  and 5th years) from 1961 to 1999 (every other year).  (See OECD, 1994, Table 8.1 for  the 1991 data).  From this we derive a measure of the benefit replacement ratio, equal  to the average over family types in the 1st year duration category and a measure of  benefit duration equal to [0.6 (2nd and 3rd year replacement ratio) + 0.4 (4th and 5th  year replacement ratio)] ÷ (1st year replacement ratio).  So our measure of benefit    14duration is the level of benefit in the later years of the spell normalised on the benefit  in the first year of the spell.  A summary of these data is presented in Tables 8 and 9.  The key feature of these data is that in nearly all countries, benefit replacement  ratios have tended to become more generous from the 1960s to the late 1970s, the  exceptions being Germany, Japan and New Zealand.  Italy had no effective benefit  system over this period for the vast majority of the unemployed.  After the late 1970s,  countries moved in different directions.  Italy introduced a benefit system and those in  Finland, Portugal and Switzerland became markedly more generous.  By contrast,  benefit replacement ratios in Belgium, Ireland the UK have fallen steadily since the  late 1970s or early 1980s.     It  is  unfortunate  that  we  have  no  comprehensive  time  series  data  on  the  Table 8 here  coverage of the system or on the strictness with which it is administered.  This is  particularly true in the case of the latter because the evidence we possess appears to  indicate  that  this  is  of  crucial  importance  in  determining  the  extent  to  which  a  generous  level  of  benefit  will  actually  influence  unemployment.    For  example,  Denmark, which has very generous unemployment benefits (see Tables 8, 9), totally  reformed  the  operation  of  its  benefit  system  through  the  1990s  with  a  view  to  tightening the criteria for benefit receipt and the enforcement of these criteria via a  Table 9 here  comprehensive system of sanctions.  The Danish Ministry of Labour is convinced that  this  process  has  played  a  major  role  in  allowing  Danish  unemployment  to  fall  dramatically  since  the  early  1990s  without  generating  inflationary  pressure  (see  Danish Ministry of Finance, 1999, Chapter 2).  Just to see some of the ways in which  systems of administration vary across country, in Table 10 we present indices of the  strictness of the work availability conditions in various countries.  These are based on  eight sub-indicators referring to the rules relating to the types of jobs that unemployed  individuals must accept or incur some financial or other penalty.  We can see that  countries with notable lax systems in the mid-1990s include Austria, Finland, France,  Germany,  Ireland  and  the  UK,  although  Ireland  and  the  UK  have  significantly  tightened their benefit operations since that time.     A further aspect of the structure of the benefit system for which we do not  Table 10 here  have detailed data back to the 1960s are those policies grouped under the heading of  active labour market policies (ALMP).  We do, however, have data from 1985 which  we present in Table 11.  The purpose of these is to provide active assistance to the  unemployed which will improve their chances of obtaining work.  Multi-country    15studies basically using cross section information indicate that ALMPs do have a  negative impact on unemployment (e.g. Scarpetta, 1996; Nickell, 1997;  Elmeskov et  al., 1998).  This broad brush evidence is backed up by numbers of microeconometric  studies (see Katz, 1998, Martin, 2000 or Martin and Grubb, 2001 for useful surveys)  which show that under some circumstances, active labour market policies are  effective.  In particular, job search assistance tends to have consistently positive  outcomes but other types of measure such as employment subsidies and labour market  training must be well designed if they are to have a significant impact (see Martin,  2000, for a detailed analysis).  Turning to the numbers, we see that, by and large, the countries of Northern  Europe and Scandinavia devote most resources to ALMPs.  It might be hypothesised  that they do this because high expenditure on ALMPs is required to offset their rather  generous unemployment benefit systems and to push unemployed individuals into  work.  Such additional pressure on the unemployed is not required if benefits are very  low relative to potential earnings in work.  Systems of Wage Determination  In most countries in the OECD, the majority of workers have their wages set  by  collective  bargaining  between  employers  and  trade  unions  at  the  plant,  firm,  industry or aggregate level.  This is important for our purposes because there is some  evidence  that  trade  union  power  in  wage  setting  has  a  significant  impact  on  unemployment13.    Unfortunately,  we  do  not  have  complete  data  on  collective  bargaining coverage (the proportion of employees covered by collective agreements)  but  the  data  presented  in  Table  12  give  a  reasonable  picture.    Across  most  of  Continental Europe, including Scandinavia but excluding Switzerland, coverage is  both high and stable.  As we shall see, this is either because most people belong to  trade unions or because union agreements are extended by law to cover non-members  Table 12 here  in the same sector.  In Switzerland and in the OECD countries outside Continental  Europe and Scandinavia, coverage is generally much lower with the exception of  Australia.  In the UK, the US and New Zealand, coverage has declined with the fall in  union density, there being no extension laws.    In Table 13, we present the percentage of employees who are union members.   Table 13 here  Across most of Scandinavia, membership tends to be high.  By contrast, in much of  Continental Europe and in Australia, union density tends to be less than 50 percent  and is gradually declining.  In these countries there is, consequently, a wide and    16widening gap between density and coverage which it is the job of the extension laws  to fill.  This situation is at its most stark in France, which has the lowest union density  in the OECD at around 10 percent, but one of the highest levels of coverage (around  95 percent).  Outside these regions, both density and coverage tend to be relatively  low and both are declining at greater or lesser rates.  The absence of complete  coverage data means that we have to rely on the density variable to capture the impact  of unionisation on unemployment.  As should be clear, this is only half the story, so  we must treat any results we find in this area with some caution.    The other aspect of wage bargaining which appears to have a significant  impact  on  wages  and  unemployment  is  the  extent  to  which  bargaining  is  co- ordinated14, 15.  Roughly speaking, the evidence suggests that if bargaining is highly  co-ordinated,  this  will  completely  offset  the  adverse  effects  of  unionism  on  employment (see Nickell and Layard, 1999, for example).  Co-ordination refers to  mechanisms whereby the aggregate employment implications of wage determination  are taken into account when wage bargains are struck.  This may be achieved if wage  bargaining is highly centralised, as in Austria, or if there are institutions, such as  employers’  federations,  which  can  assist  bargainers  to  act  in  concert  even  when  bargaining itself ostensibly occurs at the level of the firm or industry, as in Germany  or Japan (see Soskice, 1991).  It is worth noting that co-ordination is not, therefore,  the same as centralisation which refers simply to the level at which bargaining takes  place (plant, firm, industry or economy-wide).  In Table 14, we present co-ordination  indices for the OECD from the 1960s.  The first index (co-ord 1) basically ignores  transient changes whereas the second (co-ord 2) tries to capture the various detailed  nuances  of  the  variations  in  the  institutional  structure.  Notable  changes  are  the  Table 14 here  increases in co-ordination in Ireland and the Netherlands towards the end of the period  and  the  declines  in  co-ordination  in  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  Sweden.    Co- ordination also declines in the UK over the same period but this simply reflects the  sharp decline of unionism overall.  Employment Protection  Employment  protection  laws  are  thought  by  many  to  be  a  key  factor  in  generating  labour  market  inflexibility.    Despite  this,  evidence  that  they  have  a  decisive impact on overall rates of unemployment is mixed, at best16.  In Table 15, we  present details of an employment protection index for the OECD countries.  Features    17to note are the wide variation in the index across countries and the fact that, in some  countries, the basic legislation was not introduced until the 1970s.  Labour Taxes  Table 15 here    The important taxes here are those that form part of the wedge between the  real product wage (labour costs per employee normalised on the output price) and the  real consumption wage (after tax pay normalised on the consumer price index).  These  are payroll taxes, income taxes and consumption taxes.  Their combined impact on  unemployment remains a subject of some debate despite the large number of  empirical investigations.  Indeed some studies indicate that employment taxes have no  long run impact on unemployment whatever whereas others present results which  imply that they can explain more or less all the rise in unemployment in most  countries during the 1960-1985 period17.  In Table 16 we present the total tax rate on  labour for the OECD countries.  All countries exhibit a substantial increase over the  period from the 1960s to the 1990s although there are wide variations across  countries.  These mainly reflect the extent to which health, higher education and  pensions are publicly provided along with the all-round generosity of the social  security system.  Some countries have made significant attempts to reduce labour  taxes in recent years, notably the Netherlands and the UK.  Table 16 here  Labour Market Institutions and the Successes and Failures of the 1990s  Having looked at some of the key factors which the evidence suggests have  some impact on equilibrium unemployment, let us see how changes in these variables  over the last two decades can contribute to our understanding of unemployment  changes over the same period.  In Table 17, we provide a picture of changes in the  relevant variables with a tick referring to a significant move which will tend to reduce  unemployment and a cross for the reverse.  Double ticks and crosses reflect really big  moves.  A dash implies no significant change.  Of course, this is a pretty crude  business and a proper panel data analysis is arguable preferable.  However, here we  are able to take account of variables where we are unable to obtain long time series.   Readers who prefer panel data analysis can consult the papers discussed in Section 5.  Table 17 here    So we can ask the question, do the ticks and crosses bear any relationship to  the unemployment changes reported in the final columns of the table?  If we regress  the unemployment change on the number of ticks and crosses we obtain:    18R2 = 0.51 Unemployment change (%)  =  0.25  –1.25 ticks   +1.21 crosses         N = 20  (80/87 to 00/01)          (3.1)            (2.2)    Or, in restricted form,  R2 = 0.51 Unemployment change (%)  =  -0.42  -1.24 (ticks-crosses)         N = 20  (80/87 to 00/01)          (4.3)    The restriction is easily accepted.  So the number of ticks and crosses explains about  half the cross-country variation in unemployment changes from the early 80s to the  present day.  We may reasonably conclude that the countries which had very high  unemployment in the early 1980s and still have high unemployment today simply  have too few ticks and/or too many crosses.  7.  Summary and Conclusions  Average unemployment in Europe today is relatively high compared with  OECD countries outside Europe.  The majority of countries in Europe today have  lower unemployment than any OECD country outside Europe, including the US.   These two facts are consistent because the four largest countries in Continental  Western Europe namely, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, (the Big Four), have very  high unemployment and most of the rest have comparatively low unemployment.   This variability is highly informative because the fifteen European countries which we  consider have more or less independent labour markets in practice, despite “free”  movement of labour.  Using this information we see how changes in the structure of  the various labour markets explain a substantial proportion of the secular fluctuations  in unemployment in the various countries.  In particular, we pin down some of the  particular factors which enable us to understand why some European countries have  been able fully to recover from the unemployment disasters of the early 1980s  whereas some have not.    19Endnotes    1.  Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, US.    2.  Of course, we are currently gradually recovering from a relatively mild recession,  but most countries in the OECD are at similar stages in the cycle, so this is not  causing significant distortions.    3.  A key isue here is whether husbands and wives are taxed jointly or separately.   See OECD (1990), Table 6.3.    4.  From a report in The Guardian newspaper, April 6, 2002.     5.  There is obviously some short-run slippage between aggregate demand and  employment accounted for by variation in inventories and the intensity of work by  employees.  This is not germane to the main thrust of the argument in the text.    6.  2% is at the top of the ECB target range.    7.  Of course, the US economy turned down in 2001 and this would have had some  additional impact on the Eurozone.  However, looking closely at the data, we see  that in 2000/2, GDP growth has exceeded the growth of final domestic demand in  every quarter, indicating a positive contribution of net trade (plus inventories)  throughout.  Furthermore, from the peak of GDP growth [2000 (ii)] to the trough  [2002 (i)], GDP growth fell by 3.8 percentage points and the final domestic  demand contribution fell by 3.5 percentage points.  So the vast majority of the fall  arises domestically.    8.  This is a standard consequence of hysteresis in the unemployment process.  There  is a discussion on p.382 of Layard et al. (1991).    9.  A good general reference is Holmlund (1998).  A useful survey of micro studies  can be found in OECD (1994), Chapter 8.  Micro evidence from policy changes is  contained in Carling et al. (1999), Hunt (1995) and Harkman (1997).  Cross- country macro evidence is available in Nickell and Layard (1999), Scarpetta  (1996) and Elmeskov et al. (1998).  The average of their results indicates a 1.11  percentage point rise in equilibrium unemployment for every 10 percentage point  rise in the benefit replacement ratio.    10. There is fairly clear micro evidence that shorter benefit entitlement leads to  shorter unemployment duration (see Ham and Rea (1987), Katz and Meyer (1990)  and Carling et al. (1996)).      11. Variations in the coverage of unemployment benefits are large (see OECD, 1994,  Table 8.4) and there is a strong positive correlation between coverage and the  level of benefit (OECD, 1994, p.190).  Bover et al. (1998) present strong evidence  for Spain and Portugal that the covered exit unemployment more slowly than the  uncovered.      2012. There is strong evidence that the strictness with which the benefit system is  operated, at given levels of benefit, is a very important determinant of  unemployment duration.  Micro evidence for the Netherlands may be found in  Abbring et al. (1999) and Van Den Berg et al. (1999).  Cross country evidence is  available in the Danish Ministry of Finance (1999), Chapter 2 and in OECD  (2000), Chapter 4.    13. See the discussion in Nickell and Layard (1999), Section 8 and Booth et al. (2000)  (particularly around Table 6.2) for positive evidence.    14. See the discussion in Nickell and Layard (1999), Section 8, Booth et al. (2000)  (particularly around Table 6.1) and OECD (1997), Chapter 3.    15. One aspect of wage determination which we do not analyse in this paper is  minimum wages.  This is for two reasons.  First, the balance of the evidence  suggests that minimum wages are generally low enough not to have much of an  impact on employment except for young people.  Second, only around half the  OECD countries had statutory minimum wages over the period 1960-95.  Of  course, trade unions may enforce “minimum wages” but this is only a minor part  of their activities.  And these are already accounted for in our analysis of density,  coverage and co-ordination.      16. The results presented by Lazear (1990), Addison and Grosso (1996), Bentolila and  Bertola (1990), Elmeskov et al. (1998), Nickell and Layard (1999) do not add up  to anything very decisive although there is a clear positive relationship between  employment protection and long-term unemployment.    17. A good example of a study in this latter group is Daveri and Tabellini (2000)  whereas one in the former group is OECD (1990, Annex 6).  Extensive  discussions may be found in Nickell and Layard (1999), Section 6, Disney (2000)  and Pissarides (1998).    21References      Abbring, J. H., Van Den Berg, G. J and Van Ours, J. C.

As far as possible, these numbers correspond to the OECD standardised rates and conform to the ILO  definition.  The exception here is Italy where we use the US Bureau of Labor Statistics “unemployment rates on  US concepts”.  In particular we use the correction to the OECD standardised rates made by the Bureau prior to  1993.  This generates a rate which is 1.6 percentage points below the OECD standardised rate after 1993.  The rates  referred to in Spain* refer to recently revised ILO rates.  For earlier years we use the data reported in LNJ  published by the UK Department of Education and Employment.

Most Italian unemployed do not fall under this category.    33Table 9    Unemployment Benefit Duration Index, 1960-95      1960-64  1965-72  1973-79  1980-87  1988-95  1999                Australia  1.02  1.02  1.02  1.02  1.02  1.00  Austria  0  0  0.69  0.75  0.74  0.68  Belgium  1.0  0.96  0.78  0.79  0.77  0.78  Canada  0.33  0.31  0.20  0.25  0.22  0.42  Denmark  0.63  0.66  0.66  0.62  0.84  1.00  Finland  0  0.14  0.72  0.61  0.53  0.63  France  0.28  0.23  0.19  0.37  0.49  0.47  Germany  0.57  0.57  0.61  0.61  0.61  0.75  Ireland  0.68  0.78  0.39  0.40  0.39  0.77  Italy  0  0  0  0  0.13  0  Japan  0  0  0  0  0  0  Netherlands  0.12  0.35  0.53  0.66  0.57  0.64  Norway  0  0.07  0.45  0.49  0.50  0.60  New  1.02  1.02  1.02  1.04  1.04  1.00  Zealand  Portugal  -  -  0  0.11  0.35  0.58  Spain  0  0  0.01  0.21  0.27  0.29  Sweden  0  0  0.04  0.05  0.04  0.02  Switzerland  0  0  0  0  0.18  0.31  UK  0.87  0.59  0.54  0.71  0.70  0.96  US  0.12  0.17  0.19  0.17  0.18  0.22    Source:  OECD.

In both Spain and Portugal, union  membership in the 1960s and 1970s does not have the same implications as elsewhere because there was  pervasive government intervention in wage determination during most of this period.    (ii)  (a)  Effectively, bargained wages extended to non-union firms typically at the behest of  one party to the bargain.    (b)  Extension only at the behest of both parties to a bargain.
