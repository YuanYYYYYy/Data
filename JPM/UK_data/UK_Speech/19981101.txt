Economic policy, with and without forecasts    Speech given by  Sir Alan Budd, member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee    Given at the Sir Alec Cairncross Lecture  November 1998          1    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspxEconomic policy, with and without forecasts In this speech,(1) Sir Alan Budd, a member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, discusses the debate between those who believe that monetary policy should be based on a small number of current indicators and those who use model-based forecasts to assist their decisions.  He argues that all policy-makers use forecasts, implicitly or explicitly, and all respond to current indicators.  He describes the role of the inflation forecast in the MPC’s decisions. My topic this evening is the use of forecasts in economic In August,(3)he discussed the MPC’s concern with the policy-making in general and their use by the Bank of output gap,and records his preference for monitoring England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in particular. nominal demand.  He said: Although this lecture is dedicated to Alec Cairncross,the ‘As an immediate step I would give more weight to actual first part of it is devoted to,or perhaps directed at,another inflation as distinct from rarefied speculation about its trend economist whom I greatly admire and respect,namely in two years’time’.

I shall start with some quotations taken from recent columns and articles by Mr Brittan. ‘There is no perfect solution;  but it would help to go more by actual evidence of inflation and less by forecasts and First,a few extracts from an Economic Viewpointin May of models...’ this year:(2) He goes on: ‘But the signal for middle-of-the-road opinion to swing towards the hawks is unlikely to be the minutiae of the ‘National cash objectives can indeed be pursued by  forecast path for ... output to which the [Bank of England’s] means of formal forecasts and with a heavy fine-tuning Inflation Reportdevotes such loving care’. emphasis.

That is,it can enable us to rely less on forecasting ability.  For it would not be disastrous if ‘This may not be entirely rational,but it is hardly less so the best we could do would be to react to the current than the supposedly scientific forecasting in which the more situation’. academic members of the MPC prefer to indulge’. The view being expressed here is that it is better to conduct He concludes: policy on the basis of observing a few actual variables than on forecasts derived from econometric models. ‘Someone who is suspicious of forecasts is not committed to ignoring clear forward-looking information,of the kind There are important substantive issues here,but first I  we had when oil prices rose fourfold in 1973.

And one is tempted England,Mervyn King kindly drew my attention to to say,‘If it’s the forecast that upsets you,we can leave it comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan out’.

He went on: in due course.  But having,I hope,resolved a question of semantics,let me move on to the substantive issue,which ‘The belief that some formal set of rules for policy concerns the nature of the reaction functions.

They are inflation (which has now been joined by a forecast of related to policy-making rather than to forecasting itself.  I output)?

If we Another charge is that the foxes rely excessively on models, believe that the variables that are not included in the model without fully understanding the data on which they are are relevant to our decisions,we obviously want to take based.  (That was the fear expressed by Alec Cairncross.) them into account.  There are considerable advantages to There is the related charge that the foxes have an exalted using the forecast as a framework for doing this.  For one view of their ability to control inflation,and therefore thing,it gives us a language with which we are familiar.  We indulge in excessive fine-tuning.  There are really two are used to watching an economy unfold and thinking about different versions of this charge.  The first,which was how it will develop in the future.  We also have some ideas propounded by Milton Friedman,states that policy-makers about the normal ranges within which an economy will do not have superior information about future cyclical behave (although of course we can all be greatly surprised movements in the economy.  Their attempts at stabilisation from time to time).  Thus if we think there is important new (either for its own sake or as a means of controlling information in a non-model variable,we can examine the inflation) will therefore make matters worse.  There is a plausibility of the effect that it might have on the future path more recent version,which will be discussed by my of inflation,and hence its possible implications for our colleague Charles Goodhart in the Keynes Lecture in two decision.  Finally,the model allows us to take account of the days’time.  He examines the argument that if our complex interactions within the economy,so that we can knowledge of the economy is subject to a particular kind of assess how changes in one part of the economy will change uncertainty—known as Brainard uncertainty—large changes the overall picture.  But we remain able to modify those in policy in response to changes in the expected rate of effects if we believe we should do so. inflation could cause an undesirable increase in the volatility of inflation.  Charles discusses the issue in relation to the I have referred to the econometric model.  In fact,the Bank observed frequency of policy changes,particularly policy uses a suite of models,and we use our intuition and reversals.  I shall not anticipate his conclusions. theoretical understanding to decide which particular model is appropriate to thinking about current circumstances.  We Since these types of argument are based on policy-making can also develop ad hocmodels to explore the implications rather than on forecasting on its own,there is no satisfactory of particular developments.  For example,understanding the way of resolving them.  We would have to run through implications of a possible credit crunch might require a history twice,once with the hedgehogs in charge and once special model.  The suite of models enables us to put with the foxes in charge,and compare the outcomes.  As a together components from different models to construct an possible substitute,we can conduct synthetic experiments; appropriate forecasting model each quarter.

We go from one set of observations to a formally produced forecast,and I mentioned earlier that the production of an explicit we then adjust that forecast in the light of all other forecast is not a necessary part of policy-making if we rely information that we believe is relevant.  (In practice,even on a formal reaction function.

Such inflation target. a forecast will have been produced,using a combination of formal and informal methods,by the staff of the central So even if there is agreement about the forecast,there is no bank (or finance ministry).  It may inform the decision,but simple mapping from the forecast to the policy decision. the policy-makers are not responsible for,or committed to, the forecast itself.  This all smacks of fox-like behaviour.  How do we meet the criticisms made by the hedgehogs?  I said that the That is not,in my view,the current position.  The forecast publication of the forecast serves the external purpose of represents the collective view of the MPC members.  It is explaining our decisions to the public.  The Inflation Report not necessarily anyone’s individual forecast,nor is it the is designed to fulfil the requirement imposed on the MPC average of the individual forecasts.  If the MPC was told to by the Bank of England Act to publish a quarterly report go away until it had produced a single forecast,this is the containing: forecast it would produce after discussion and a willingness to accept some compromise.
