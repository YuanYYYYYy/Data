The Health, Wealth and Happiness of Nations Andrew G Haldane Centre for Policy Studies Lecture Bloomberg 24 February 2020Adam Smith (1776) “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our  dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” Smith (Wealth of Nations (1776)) 2Adam Smith (1776) “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our  dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” Smith (Wealth of Nations (1776)) “No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the  members are poor and miserable.” Smith (Wealth of Nations (1776)) 3“Designing institutions to force (or nudge) entirely self-interested individuals to achieve  better outcomes has been the major goal posited by policy analysts for governments to  accomplish for much of the past half century.  Extensive empirical research leads me to  argue that, instead, a core goal of public policy should be to facilitate the development of  institutions that bring out the best in humans.” Elinor Ostrom (Nobel Lecture, (2009)) 4Plan • Enlightenment then • Six Pillars of Success • Enlightenment Now? • The New Pillars of Success  “Community Capitalism” 5Wealth Wealth Income Real GDP per capita UK wealth per capita £  (2013 prices) (2000 prices) 30,000 450,000 1776 1776 400,000 25,000 350,000 20,000 300,000 250,000 15,000 200,000 10,000 150,000 100,000 5,000 50,000 0 0 1270 1370 1470 1570 1670 1770 1870 1970 1760 1800 1840 1880 1920 1960 2000 Sources:  Bank of England Millennium of Data Source: McLaughlin, E. et al.
