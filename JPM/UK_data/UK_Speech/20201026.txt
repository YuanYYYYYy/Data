The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)  The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) is a network of over 1,500  research economists based mostly in European universities. The Centre’s goal  is twofold: to promote world-class research, and to get the policy-relevant  results into the hands of key decision-makers. CEPR’s guiding principle is  ‘Research excellence with policy relevance’. A registered charity since it was  founded in 1983, CEPR is independent of all public and private interest groups.  It takes no institutional stand on economic policy matters and its core funding  comes from its Institutional Members and sales of publications. Because  it draws on such a large network of researchers, its output reflects a broad  spectrum of individual viewpoints as well as perspectives drawn from civil  society.

In McKibbin and Fernando (2020), we used data  from historical pandemics to explore seven plausible scenarios of the  economic consequences if COVID-19 were to become a global pandemic.  8 In  this  paper,  we  use  currently  observed  epidemiological  outcomes  5 1- across countries and recent data on sectoral shutdowns and economic  0:  shocks to estimate the likely global economic impacts of the pandemic  2 0 under six new scenarios. The first scenario explores the outcomes if the  2 y  current course of COVID-19 is successfully controlled, and there is only  l u J a mild recurrence in 2021. We then explore scenarios where the opening  3  2 of  economies  results  in  recurrent  outbreaks  of  various  magnitudes  9,  and countries respond with and without economic shutdowns. We also  3 s  explore the impact if no vaccine becomes available and the world must  c mi adapt to living with COVID-19 in coming decades. The final scenario is the  o case where a given country is in the most optimistic scenario (Scenario 1),  n o c but the rest of the world is in the most pessimistic scenario. The scenarios  E d  demonstrate that even a contained outbreak will significantly impact  vi the global economy in the coming years. The economic consequences of  o C the pandemic under plausible scenarios are substantial and the ongoing  economic adjustment is far from over. 1  We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Australia Research Council Centre of Excellence  in Population Ageing Research (CE170100005).

Copyright: Warwick McKibbin and Roshen Fernando COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS2 1  Introduction  In late 2019, a novel coronavirus was causing infections in China. The virus had close  virological characteristics to the coronavirus that caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and was named  SARS-CoV-2. Even though the SARS-CoV-2 has been less fatal than SARS-CoV, SARS- CoV-2 has been much more infectious. Shortly after the Chinese outbreak, other countries also  began reporting cases. The evolving epidemic was officially declared a pandemic by the World  Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.  In early February 2020, we undertook a study that applied data from historical pandemics,  information on the evolving epidemic in China and our experience from modelling SARS and  Bird Flu to explore the potential global economic implications of COVID-19 under seven  8 5 plausible scenarios in a global economic model. “The global macroeconomic impacts of  - 1 :  COVID-19: seven scenarios” was released on 2 March 2020. Early results were made available  0 2 to policymakers in major economies and international institutions. At the time the paper was  0 2 y  written, it was still uncertain whether the outbreak would translate into a pandemic. Thus, to  l u J estimate what could be the likely costs of a pandemic, three of the seven scenarios explored  3  2 9,  the economic costs to the world if the outbreak only occurred in China and four of the scenarios  3 explored the global economic costs if a global pandemic occurred but at varying degrees of  s  c mi attack rates and case fatality rates.  o n o The evolution of the pandemic and the economic implications continue to be highly uncertain.  c E d  However, as new information emerges, notably greater understanding through scientifically  i v o based interventions in some countries and outright failure in others, the nature of the  C uncertainty has changed. Initially, uncertainty was about how close COVID-19 would be to the  historical experience of pandemics. After six months, the concern is now about how frequently  the pandemic might recur and how high the economic costs of responding or not responding in  some countries might be. Policy in many countries initially was designed to contain the virus  and to minimise economic disruption, particularly in the labour market. The focus now is how  to open economies hit with a massive economic shock and how economies will adapt to the  post-COVID-19 world. It is uncertain whether a vaccine will be available in time to prevent  more pandemic waves and, if not, what would be the least costly option of managing them. It  is an open question of whether lockdowns are the right option for managing recurring waves  or if it will be possible for people to adapt to long-term social distancing and improved hygiene  practices.  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS3 In this paper, we attempt to guide policymakers determine how different responses might  change possible economic futures. In addition to our previous experience in modelling  pandemics and particularly COVID-19, we capitalise on the novel, yet imperfect, information  on cases and responses to the pandemic worldwide.  The paper is structured as follows. The next section places the current study in the context of  our previous study and other recent studies conducted by the International Monetary Fund  (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the World  Bank on economic repercussions of COVID-19. Section 3 summarises the G-Cubed model  used in the study. Section 4 explains in depth how and why different scenarios and shocks were  constructed. The results from the simulations are presented in Section 5 before we conclude  and present possible policy implications arising from the study in the final section.  8 5 - 1 2  Studies on Global Macroeconomics of COVID-19  :  0 2 0 2 When we conducted our first study, it was still uncertain whether the outbreak in China would  y  ul spread to the rest of the world. Thus, our study included three scenarios where the outbreak  J 3  was contained in China, still varying the proportion of people getting infected (the attack rate).  2 9,  We also varied the mortality rates using the case-fatality rate for SARS as a benchmark. The  3 cs  remaining four scenarios explored the economic implications if the outbreak were to translate  i m into a global pandemic. Similar to the first three scenarios, we had three attack rates with  o n o varying degrees of mortality, resembling those of SARS and flu. The seventh scenario was a  c E d  recurring pandemic at a moderate attack rate and case-fatality rate. Table 1 summarises these  i v o scenarios.  C A handful of countries from East Asia and the Middle East had some previous experience with  coronavirus outbreaks. However, the vast majority of the countries had limited experience.  Thus, when formulating the shocks in the original study, including the mortality and morbidity,  impact on productivity and consumption as well as changes in sector risk premia and  government expenditure, the formulation of shocks for other countries used China as a  benchmark. In the study, the susceptibility to a coronavirus outbreak for other countries relative  to China was modelled using an Index of Vulnerability. This index considered population  density within a given country, openness to tourism and health and sanitation standards of the  country.

The  studies  by  the  World  Trade  s  ic Organization  (2020),  Maliszewska  et  al.  (2020)  and  the  World  Bank  (2020a)  utilise  m o Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models and mainly focus on the impact of mortality,  n o c morbidity and increased production costs on the economies. A study by the International  E d  Monetary Fund [IMF] (2020c), which utilises a semi-structural Dynamic Stochastic General  i v o C Equilibrium (DSGE) model, also includes disruptions to financial markets.  The OECD (2020) released Global Economic Outlook on 10 June 2020, in which it explores  two scenarios focusing on the recurrence of COVID-19 and presents its expectations about  global economic repercussions. Table 2 summarises the current expectations about the global  economic consequences of the pandemic set out in the recent reports by the IMF (2020a),  World Bank (2020b) and OECD (2020), segregated by the countries and the regions that we  focus on in this study.  The range of estimates across countries and studies are diverse. Still, all studies show a  substantial negative shock to the global economy in 2020 with an expected rebound in 2021  but not back to the levels of GDP in most countries experienced in 2019. These are consistent  with the analysis in this paper.

This model is a hybrid of Dynamic Stochastic  General Equilibrium (DSGE) Models and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models  developed by McKibbin and Wilcoxen (1999, 2013).  The G-Cubed Model  The version of the G-Cubed (G20) model used in this paper can be found in McKibbin and  Triggs (2018) who extended the original model documented in McKibbin and Wilcoxen (1999,  2013). The model has six sectors and 24 countries and regions. Table 3 presents all the regions  and sectors in the model. Some of the data inputs include the I/O tables found in the Global  8 5 - Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database (Aguiar et al. 2019), which enables us to differentiate  1 :  0 sectors by country of production within a DSGE framework. Firms in each sector in each  2 0 2 country produce output using the primary factor inputs of capital (K) and labour (L) as well as  y  ul the intermediate or production chains of inputs in energy (E) and materials (M). These linkages  J 3  are both within a country and across countries.  2 9,  3 McKibbin and Wilcoxen (1999, 2013) document the approach embodied in the G-Cubed  s  c i model. Several key features of the standard G-Cubed model are worth highlighting here.   m o n o First, the model completely accounts for stocks and flows of physical and financial assets. For  c E d  example, budget deficits accumulate into government debt, and current account deficits  i v o accumulate into foreign debt. The model imposes an intertemporal budget constraint on all  C households, firms, governments, and countries. Thus, a long-run stock equilibrium obtains  through the adjustment of asset prices, such as the interest rate for government fiscal positions  or real exchange rates for the balance of payments. However, the adjustment towards the long- run equilibrium of each economy can be slow, occurring over much of a century.   Second, firms and households in G-Cubed must use money issued by central banks for all  transactions. Thus, central banks in the model set short term nominal interest rates to target  macroeconomic outcomes (such as inflation, unemployment, exchange rates, etc.) based on  Henderson-McKibbin-Taylor monetary rules. These rules are designed to approximate actual  monetary regimes in each country or region in the model.  These monetary rules tie down the  long-run inflation rates in each country as well as allowing short term adjustment of policy to  smooth fluctuations in the real economy.

Firms hire labour in each sector up to the points that the marginal  o n o product of labour equals the real wage defined in terms of the output price level of that sector.  c E d  Any excess labour enters the unemployed pool of workers. Unemployment or the presence of  i v excess demand for labour causes the nominal wage to adjust to clear the labour market in the  o C long run. In the short-run, unemployment can arise due to structural supply shocks or changes  in aggregate demand in the economy.   Fourth, rigidities prevent the economy from moving quickly from one equilibrium to another.  These rigidities include nominal stickiness caused by wage rigidities, costs of adjustment in  investment by firms with physical capital being sector-specific in the short-run. The adjustment  path is also affected by a lack of complete foresight in the formation of expectations and by  monetary and fiscal authorities following particular monetary and fiscal rules. Short-term  adjustment to economic shocks can be very different from the long-run equilibrium outcomes.  The focus on short-run rigidities is essential for assessing the impact over the first decades of  a major shock.     COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS8 Fifth, we incorporate heterogeneous households and firms. Firms are modelled separately  within each sector. We assume two types of consumers and two types of firms within each  sector, within each country. One group of consumers and firms base their decisions on forward- looking expectations. The other group follow simple rules of thumb which are optimal in the  long-run.  4  Modelling Economic Impacts of COVID-19  4.1  Modelling Scenarios  A pandemic directly affects an economy via its impacts on humans due to infections which  lead to morbidity (unable to work temporarily) and mortality (death). There are also likely to  be significant changes in the behaviour of households and firms to avoid contracting or  8 5 - transmitting the disease. Also, due to the substantial transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2,  1 0:  governments across the world have responded with direct policy changes, to varying degrees,  2 0 2 to reduce transmission. These responses include restricting movements across as well as within  y  l borders,  banning  public  gatherings,  closing  educational  institutions  and  non-essential  u J 3  businesses. While some countries adopted these measures at very early stages of the outbreak,  2 9,  some countries were late to respond. In general, early responders have witnessed lower levels  3 s  of transmission, resulting in lower levels of infections and deaths. While controlling the  c i m transmission will significantly help the countries to return to the normality sooner and mitigate  o n o the long-term economic impacts emanating from the loss of human resources, the change in  c E d  human behaviour and the industrial shutdowns are causing significant short- and medium-term  i v economic consequences.  o C At the same time, it is currently uncertain whether the SARS-CoV-2 could be eliminated after  the current wave. According to a wide range of medical opinion, the virus may join the other  existing coronaviruses and is unlikely to disappear in the immediate future. Thus, until a  vaccine for the disease is produced and is widely available for distribution, the COVID-19  pandemic could recur in the future.  In the case of continuous waves, it is unlikely that people and firms would continue to respond  to the future potential outbreaks the same way most have responded to the current pandemic,  i.e. by changing personal behaviour and by adopting economic shutdowns. In these cases,  households and firms would need to select more permanent behavioural changes, including    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS9 adopting better hygiene practices (see Levine & McKibbin (2020)) and implementing social  distancing measures.  Given the uncertainty outlined above, we develop six alternative scenarios. Table 4 summarises  these scenarios focussing on the number of pandemic waves in each year and whether or not  countries respond with lockdowns. The extent of lockdown response is not the same across  countries but reflects policies in place as of May 2020.

For countries that have not peaked by 20 May, we project  the  epidemiological  outcome  given  the  experience  of  other  countries  with  similar  characteristics. Countries are assumed to implement the lockdown measures announced up to  20 May, although the countries differ in the duration of the lockdowns depending on when the  outbreak reached the respective country and the management of the severity of the pandemic.  After the first wave, as a vaccine is yet to be developed, we assume that a milder outbreak  occurs again in early 2021. We assume that infections in the second wave are limited to half of  the infections that have emerged during the current wave. We assume that the shocks to  households and firms are half of that experienced in 2020 and countries adopt half of the current    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS10 lockdown durations.  This scenario is an optimistic assessment that the current pandemic is at  its worst today and will eventually improve, and a vaccine will eliminate future waves after  2021.  The second scenario allows for more persistence in the re-emergence of COVID-19. The first  year of the second scenario is as same as the first year of the first scenario. However, the second  scenario assumes that the pandemic will recur annually with an exponential decay in the  number of infections. The countries are assumed to adopt lockdowns to manage the pandemic  at the same rate as the pandemic emerges over time.  The third scenario assumes that countries, who have managed the pandemic with lockdowns,  begin to relax the movement restrictions. The third scenario explores the possibility of a second  8 wave emerging again in 2020 because the timing of easing restrictions turns out to be too early.  5 - 1 However, the countries manage the second wave better with only half of the infections and  :  0 2 lockdown durations compared to the first wave. A third wave, similar to the second wave, also  0 2 y  emerges in 2021.  l u J 3  The fourth scenario is the same as the third scenario but with a fourth wave in the second half  2 9,  of 2021. This fourth wave is half of the size of the first wave in 2021 compared to the number  3 s  of infections and the length of the lockdowns.  c i m o The fifth scenario assumes after the first wave, there is no vaccine developed, and the pandemic  n o c continues to emerge in subsequent years. The countries that followed lockdown discard that  E d  policy in future outbreaks after the first wave. In all countries, the pandemic eventually dies  i v o C out due to herd immunity. In this case, we assume the increase in equity risk premia do not  return to baseline so that there is a permanent change in global risk.   The sixth scenario consists of twenty-four simulations. We assume each country alone  experiences scenario 01 while all other countries experience scenario 04. Comparing the first  scenario with the sixth scenario shows how much economic impact there is on each country  because of worsening global pandemic outcomes even if that country has the pandemic under  control.  The shocks and how their magnitudes vary according to the scenarios are discussed next in  section 4.2.    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS11 4.2  Shock Formulation  One of the issues that we need to accommodate is the fact that the waves of infections are  assumed to be waves over four months rather than over a year. Since the G-Cubed model is an  annual model, we adjust the shocks to fit the periodicity of the model.   A flowchart outlining how we calculate each shock is contained in Appendix A. Further  details can also be found on the results dashboard available via  https://cama.crawford.anu.edu.au/covid-19-macroeconomic-modelling-results-dashboard  and the discussion that follows.  4.2.1  Shocks to Labour Supply  There are three shocks to labour supply.  Economic agents die due to the infection (mortality  8 5 - shock). Workers are also not able to work during their recovery if they catch the disease. People  1 :  0 caring for infected children also cannot work and we assume the carers are female workers.  2 0 2 y  In formulating the mortality component of the labour supply shock, first, we use the number of  l u J COVID-19 cases reported across the world from Our World in Data [OWID] (2020) up to 20  3  2 9,  May 2020. After 20 May, as the pandemic is continuing in many countries, we model how the  3 pandemic would likely develop given the interventions governments have already implemented  s  c mi and behavioural changes experienced by 20 May 2020. In modelling the case numbers, we  o n utilise a logistic regression model, which is more effective in demonstrating the short-term  o c E behaviour of the pandemic compared to compartmental models, and less data demanding  d  i compared to agent-based models (Almeshal et al 2020; Batista 2020). The modelling assumes  v o C that the momentum the pandemic has demonstrated by 20 May 2020 would continue until the  pandemic is controlled within that country. The actual number of reported cases for a given  country could change from our extrapolations depending on the responses by the country to the  pandemic after 20 May 2020.  After obtaining the number of cases for each country, we distribute the total cases across three  main age groups: 0-19 years, 20-59 years and 60+ years, based on data available from various  national and international resources including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and  Control [ECDC] (2020). For those countries and regions where the cases are broken down by  age group could not be found, we approximate this distribution using data for a country with a  similar general infection rate and for which the data is available. We then use the case-fatality  rates for respective countries as at 20 May 2020 to obtain the overall mortality rates.    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS12 While for the first year of the first scenario we use the epidemiological projections based on  the current data, the second wave in the first scenario and the waves in following scenarios  have either the same number of infections or a proportion of the infections as in the first year  of the first scenario. Table 5 summarises the total number of infections under each scenario for  2020 and 2021, and Table 6 presents the estimated number of deaths under each scenario.   We do not list Scenario 6 in these tables because Scenario 6 is different for each country.  Scenario 6 is constructed individually for each country, using Scenario 1 for a focus country  and Scenario 4 for all other countries. Thus, twenty-four individual simulations are generated,  rotating a new focus country for each simulation. For example, in the case of Argentina, the  deaths for Scenario 6 are those from Scenario 1, while the deaths for all other countries are  from Scenario 4.  8 5 - 1 The second component of the labour supply shock utilised the number of infections arising  :  0 2 among the working-age population, the 20-59 years old population group, to obtain the number  0 2 y  of working days lost due to the incubation after getting infected. We assume the incubation  l u J period is 14 days. Table 7 presents the magnitude of the morbidity shock emanating from the  3  2 working-age population catching the infection for the first two years under each scenario.  9,  3 s  The loss of productive work time among the female workers due to caregiving for children is  c i m the third component of the shock to labour supply. When estimating this, we utilise the number  o n o of cases among the children, i.e. the age group below 20 years, and the average female labour  c E d  force participation. We also assume only 70 per cent of the female labour force would spend  i v time on caregiving for dependent children. Table 8 presents the magnitude of the morbidity  o C shock for the first two years feeding into simulations arising from the caregiving time spent by  the female workers with infected children. This shock is small because few children are  infected.

Some firms in  some sectors have been able to utilise technology to implement remote working arrangements.  However, firms requiring the physical presence of workers to execute their operations, notably  the durable manufacturing and service sectors, have suffered due to the economic shutdowns  across the world. To assess the impact of the change in costs of doing business, which is  equivalent to a decline in total factor productivity, we apply the estimates from the Australian  Bureau of Statistics (2020), data from AUSGRID on electricity use by sector (2020) and  estimates from del Rio-Chanona et al (2020). Given this data, we estimate the effective  8 5 proportions of sub-sectors operational during the economic shutdowns. For each country, we  - 1 :  estimate what proportion of the broad-sectors could be operational, based on the contribution  0 2 0 from sub-sectors to the broad-sectors. We scale these estimates across countries and scenarios  2 y  depending on the length of economic shutdowns. Table 9 presents the assumptions on the  l u J 3  lengths of shutdowns (in months) in different countries under each scenario. Figure 1 shows  2 9,  the magnitude of the Total Factor Productivity Shock for each sector for all countries for the  3 s  first year under the first scenario.  c i m o 4.2.3  Shock to Consumption  n o c E The changes in the consumption preferences of households have been another significant  d  i source of economic impacts during the pandemic. We also attempt to capture the increase in  v o C risk, which affects households’ discounting of future income.   The change in household behaviour is mainly due to the households getting infected as well as  the inability to undertake particular economic activities due to social distancing or concern  about the infection. These shifts in consumer preferences are assumed to be exogenous to the  model. Other impacts on consumers such as a change in income, employment and wealth as  well as shifts in relative prices of different sectors and changes in interest rate etc. are  determined by the model.  Households partially foresee the long-term impacts on their wealth  with the broader economic implications of the pandemic and adjust their current consumption  patterns to maximise the expected life-long utility.

We first  change consumer preferences over a large number of subsectors. We start with the proportions  of the sub-sectors still operating and aggregate this data to calculate the broad sector change as  well as the country-wide amount of consumption that is discontinued during the pandemic. The  shock is scaled across the scenarios depending on the length of economic shutdowns in the  countries. Figure 2 presents the magnitude of the shock to consumption for the first year under  different scenarios.  The change in the risk premium for calculating human wealth is computed using the variation  in the Volatility Index (VIX), which is an indicator of changes in market sentiment. We use the  8 5 - movement of the VIX in the US for four months after the outbreak reached the US and calibrate  1 0:  the shock for the US considering its standard deviation and excess variations from the healthy  2 0 2 threshold level of 30. We then apply the Risk Aversion Index, compiled by Gandelman and  y  l Hernández-Murillo (2014), to scale the shock across the different regions in the model. For  u J 3  four countries for which the Risk Aversion Index is not available, we use those of their closest  2 9,  peers. The shocks are then scaled across scenarios using scaling factors reflecting the length of  3 s  shutdowns. Figure 3 presents the Index of Risk Aversion relative to the US for the regions in  c i m the model and Figure 4 shows the magnitude of the risk on human wealth for the first year  o n o under the different scenarios.  c E id  4.2.4  Shock to the Country & Sector Risk Premia  v o C While no country has been immune to the pandemic, the relative attractiveness of economies  and economic sectors have changed. This is evident in the changes in financial markets after  the outbreak. We attempt to capture this rebalancing in risk via a shock on the country risk  premium and equity risk premia of sectors across all countries.  Following the approach in McKibbin and Sidorenko (2006), Lee and McKibbin (2004) and  further improved in McKibbin and Fernando (2020a), we first construct a country risk index  with three main components: the indexes of Health, Governance and Financial risks.  The Index of Health Risk is the average of the Index of Health Expenditure per capita and the  Index of Health Security. The Health Expenditure per capita data are from the World Health  Organization (2019) and the Global Health Security Index, constructed by the Johns Hopkins    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS21 Figure 2  - Consumption Shock for the First Year (% GDP of Consumption Discontinued)  8 5 - 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v o C   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS22 Figure 3 - Index of Risk Aversion  8 5 - 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 Figure 4 - Increase in Risk Premium on Human Wealth for the First Year under each  9,  3 Scenario   s  c i (% Change)  m o n o c E d  i v o C   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS23 University (2019), is used to develop the Index of Health Security. The Global Health Security  Index covers six categories which include the ability to prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks  and diseases. It also assesses the health and political systems in a given country and evaluates  the country’s compliance with international health standards. Figure 5 presents the Index of  Health Risk for the regions in the model. A higher value indicates a higher health risk.  The Index of Governance Risk is calculated using the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG)  (PRSGroup 2020). The ICRG Index scores countries based on performance in 22 variables  categorised under political, economic and financial dimensions. The political dimension  accounts for government stability, the rule of law and the prevalence of conflicts. The economic  dimension is composed of GDP per capita, real GDP growth and inflation, among others.  Exchange rate stability and international liquidity are the two main variables constituting the  8 5 - financial dimension. Figure 6 presents the Index of Governance relative to the US. A higher  1 0:  value indicates a higher governance risk.  2 0 2 y  The Index of Financial Risk utilises the IMF data on Current Account Balance as a proportion  l u J of GDP to demonstrate the financial risk associated with countries. Figure 7 presents the value  3  2 of the index relative to the US. The Index of Country Risk is the arithmetic average of the three  9,  3 indices and Figure 8 shows the value of the index relative to the US, due to the prevalence of  s  c i well-developed financial markets there (Fisman & Love 2004).  m o n o We then estimate the average variation of the Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 stock market  c E d  indices in the US financial markets for four months after the outbreak. After that, using the  i v standard deviation in the US financial markets as a benchmark, we obtain estimates for other  o C countries by scaling for the lengths of lockdowns and the Index of Country Risk. Figure 9  shows the magnitude of the country risk premium shock in the first year for different scenarios.  We then scale the risk premia for a given country across scenarios by adjusting for changes in  the length of lockdowns.  The shock to the sector risk premia is calculated using the movement of the sector indices in  the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) during the four months following the outbreak. The risk  premia shocks are scaled across countries and scenarios according to the length of economic  shutdowns. When scaling across sectors, we consider the impact on productivity in different  sectors compared to the Australian sectors. Figure 10 presents the magnitude of the sector  premium shock for the first year under Scenario 01.

Each country follows the same fiscal rule. The budget  deficit is endogenous. The fiscal rule is that a lump sum tax is levied on all households to cover  the interest servicing costs of changes in net government debt caused by a change in the fiscal  deficit in response to the shocks we impose on the model. Government debt can permanently  change after a shock, but debt levels eventually stabilise. National government expenditure is  exogenous, while transfers respond to change in economic activity as do tax revenues. There  are taxes on household income, corporate income and imports. These fiscal variables all  respond when shocks occur in the model. The ultimate change in the budget deficit is a  combination of exogenous changes in government spending, transfers and wage subsidies  8 5 - where they occur, and endogenous fiscal stabilisers operating via the fiscal rule.  1 :  0 2 While imposing the lockdown measures, many governments have implemented a range of  0 2 y  fiscal measures to cushion the impact on the economy emanating from the virus, the change in  l u J household and firm behaviour and the economic shutdowns. The IMF (2020a) compilation of  3  2 the policy responses of different countries to COVID-19 reveals that the fiscal measures to  9,  3 support firms include relieving firms from paying tax and social contributions, targeted  s  c i subsidies to hard-hit sectors, exemptions for paying utility bills and credit guarantees. The  m o fiscal measures to support households include relief from tax payments, exemptions for settling  n o c utility bills and direct transfers. Wage subsidies have also been an essential component in the  E d  assortment of fiscal measures worldwide. As well as supporting targeted firms and households,  i v o C governments have also reallocated their current budgets to increase spending on the healthcare  sector. Some governments have also increased expenditure on infrastructure projects.  In this paper, we try to capture as much of the difference in policies across countries as possible.  We decompose the overall fiscal response into three parts. The first is an increase in general  government spending decomposed for the broad sectors. The second is a wage subsidy, and the  third is an exogenous increase in transfers to the households. While the data on the rise in  general government expenditure is generally available for all the countries, the magnitude of  the wage subsidies and transfers are not explicitly apparent for all countries. In this case, we  estimate these variables.  Even though the fiscal stimulus packages have been announced, there is uncertainty about what  proportion of those packages would actually be spent. Therefore, when calculating the increase       COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS29 Figure 11 - Increase in Government Expenditure excluding the Wage Subsidies &  Transfers for Households (% GDP)  8 5 - 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3   s  c i m Figure 12 - Wage Subsidies Announced (% GDP)  o n o c E d  i v o C   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS30 Figure 13 - Household Transfers Announced (% GDP)  8 5 - 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,    3   s  in government expenditure, we utilise the changes in fiscal deficit projected by the IMF in its  c i m April 2020 issue of the Fiscal Monitor. Figure 11 presents the increase in government  o n o expenditure for different regions in the model in response to the pandemic in early 2020 as a  c E d  proportion of GDP, excluding wage subsidies and transfers for countries where the explicit  i v o data is available. Figure 12 and Figure 13 show the Wage Subsidy and Household Transfers as  C a proportion of GDP for countries where the data is explicitly available.  Data on the Household Transfers as a proportion of GDP is available for 12 regions in the  model. While these details feed into Scenario 1, for the subsequent waves and scenarios they  were scaled depending on the duration of economic shutdowns compared to the current wave.  The increase in government spending is allocated across sub-sectors depending on the  preferences governments would have to support the sub-sectors. We then aggregate this  spending to calculate expenditure by government across the broad model sectors. We assume  these preferences for spending in different sectors are determined by the expected impact on  the sub-sectors during the pandemic. The proportions of government spending on the broad  sectors are then scaled across scenarios depending on the length of shutdowns. Figure 14    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS31 presents the proportions of increased government spending each broad model sector would  receive in a given country based on our estimations of government allocation of its expenditure  across the sub-sectors. Building on the Figures 11 and 14, Figure 15 presents the increase in  government spending for different sectors across different scenarios.  Figure 14 - Government Spending Allocation across Broad-sectors  8 5 - 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d    i v o C One of the notable elements in the fiscal responses to the pandemic has been the wage subsidies  introduced by different governments. Governments in the model can employ workers directly,  or they can generate employment in the private sector via demand for goods and services or  investments in infrastructure. The motive of the wage subsidies during the pandemic is to  directly support workers in jobs while preventing the rise in unemployment. Due to this  unprecedented nature of the wage subsidy, we calibrate the wage subsidy shock closely  approximating the Australian case and using the estimates by the Australian Treasury for the  employment effects of the wage subsidy.

We then scale the shock across countries  depending on the respective wage subsidy packages. We also scale the shock across scenarios  depending on the length of the shutdowns. Figure 16 presents the wage subsidy each sector  receives for the first year in Scenario 1.  5  Simulation Results  5.1  Baseline scenario  The baseline of the model is the same as that used in McKibbin and Fernando (2020a & 2020b).  To summarise, the model is solved from 2016 to 2100 with 2015 as the base year for calibrating  parameters. The key inputs into the baseline are the initial dynamics from 2015 to 2016 and  8 5 - subsequent projections from 2016 forward for labour-augmenting technological progress by  1 0:  sector and by country. The labour-augmenting technology projections follow the approach of  2 0 2 Barro (1991, 2015).  y  l u J In the alternative COVID-19 scenarios, we incorporated the range of shocks discussed above  3  2 to model the economic consequences of different epidemiological assumptions. All results  9,  3 begin in 2020 and are the difference between the COVID-19 scenario and a baseline of the  s  c i model in which there is no COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to stress that because the results  m o are either percentage change or per cent of GDP difference from the non-COVID, the  n o c interpretation of the numbers can easily be misunderstood. For example, suppose for country X  E d  that the change in GDP in 2020 is -20%. This number means that GDP in 2020 is 20% lower  i v o C than it otherwise would have been in 2020. If the country was growing at 5% in the baseline,  then the change in GDP from 2019 to 2020 is not -20% but it is -15% relative to 2019. GDP is  20% lower than the baseline in 2020.  A full set of results are presented in the model dashboard available at:  https://cama.crawford.anu.edu.au/covid-19-macroeconomic-modelling-results-dashboard.  5.2  Results for 2020  Table 10 contains the results for the $US value of GDP change in 2020 for all countries for all  scenarios.  The loss to the global economy in 2020 under scenario 01 is $US14.7 trillion. The  more waves are assumed, the larger the loss. By scenario 04 which has four waves, two each in  2020 and 2021 and a replication of the policies seen in the first wave across all countries, the  loss rises to $US 21.8 trillion.

This continuing emergence  of the pandemic causes a permanent increase in global risk. The global loss of GDP in 2020 is  $US17.3 trillion. However, the GDP loss in future years continues to acccumulate, given the  permanent risk shock. Table 11 shows the cumulative GDP loss from 2020 to 2025.  Table 12 gives a better indication of the relative decline of economic activity across countries.  This table has the change in GDP scaled by the size of GDP for each country measured relative  to the baseline in which there is no COVID-19 pandemic. (Note that these results for GDP are  not the growth rate of GDP.) The numbers in the tables are results for the percentage change in  the level of GDP relative to the baseline. For example, the Australian economy in scenario 01  is estimated to shrink by 8.57% relative to what would have been the case in 2020. The change  in the growth rate in 2020 would be the growth that would have occurred in 2020 less the  number in this table. For example, if Australia’s growth rate in 2020 would have been 2.57%,  8 5 - then the new growth rate for Australia for 2020 is estimated to be -6%.   1 :  0 2 For all countries, Scenario 1, which is optimistic given current data, has a significant contraction  0 2 y  in the global economy. The US Congressional Budget Office [CBO] (2020) most recent  l u J projection is for GDP over 2020 to be 7.6% lower than previously forecast. However, CBO  3  2 estimates that GDP in the second quarter of 2020 is 14.2% lower than otherwise.  Much of this  9,  3 difference to the results in this paper can be attributed to the longer implied persistence of the  s  c i economic slowdown relative to the CBO estimates. The current state of all economies is highly  m o uncertain.  The results for Scenario 1 are consistent with the estimates from the World Bank  n o c and IMF discussed in section 2, although the current results are, on average several percent  E d  more negative. Given the current state of uncertainty about the scale of the shock and the  i v o C evolution of the pandemic, it is unclear which set of estimates are more realistic. However, all  the studies predict a dramatic shock to the global economy much larger than the global financial  crisis a decade ago.  It is clear from the results that if the waves of the pandemic re-occur the GDP losses mount.  This mounting loss from recurring pandemic waves is even in the case where lockdowns are  not part of the policy response (in Scenario 5). It is also clear from comparing Scenario 6 with  scenario 01 that even if a country can contain the pandemic within its borders the loss to own  GDP continues to rise if the rest of the world loses control. For example, under scenario 01 for  all countries, Australia’s GDP is 8.6% lower. If we assume Australia follows scenario 01 but  the rest of the world is in Scenario 4 (i.e. Scenario 6) then Australia GDP is a further 0.7%  lower than when all countries experience Scenario 1.

These numbers  are the change in hours worked. Employment reductions are significant globally. For some  countries, such as Australia, Canada, China, South Korea and Other Asia, that either contained  the pandemic or implemented wage subsidies, the employment losses are still substantial.  However, for countries such as the United States, the loss of employment is estimated to be  14.5% in 2020 under the current information. If further waves emerge this rise sharply to 20.9%  in scenario 04 under a repeat of policies or 18% if lockdowns are discontinued in subsequent  waves (Scenario 5).  A significant part of the economic shock is the substantial collapse in consumption (Table 14)  and Investment (Table 15). The consumption shock is partly due to shifts in preferences for  transactions associated with human contact, but falling consumption is also due to the loss of  income and wealth caused by the pandemic. Higher risk through the increase in the household  8 5 - risk premium cause private savings to rise and consumption to fall. Loss of employment income  1 0:  reduces consumer spending. In addition, some of the income loss is policy-induced due to the  2 0 2 shutdown of specific activities in some countries, but much is caused by the change in the  y  l behaviour of households and firms.   u J 3  2 Investment (Table 15) also falls sharply reflecting the recessions in many economies. Higher  9,  3 risk and falling output cause the firm’s profitability to decline, which reduces the return to  s  c i capital and therefore, investment drops sharply. As with consumption, the more severe the  m o pandemic, the larger the decline in investment. The more significant the decline in investment,  n o c the larger the reduction in future output since firms require capital as an input into production.  E d  i v Table 16 shows the implications for budget deficits in all countries. For most economies, budget  o C deficits increase significantly because of policy changes in spending, taxes and wage subsidies  as well as endogenous changes in tax revenue and unemployment benefits. For some countries  which have substantial government debt (such as Argentina and Brazil), the sharp fall in real  interest rates and the economy collapses cause the fiscal position to improve.   Table 17 shows the changes in trade balances as a result of the different COVID-19 scenarios.  Trade is affected by large swings in exports and imports, and the overall trade balance is driven  by changes in savings and investment. Countries that are deeply impacted will tend to have a  rise in private savings and fall in private investment. If the government does not respond, then  there is likely to be a capital outflow. To the extent that government increase the budget deficit,  then some of this capital will flow into the government balance sheet. The net effect is that  countries that do well will tend to attract foreign capital.

Countries like  Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Russia and the rest of the world have improving trade  positions due to the capital flight. Countries like Australia, Canada and South Korea tend to  experience trade deficits due to the capital inflows. The United States has almost no impact on  the trade balance because the usual safe-haven status when the increase in global risk is offset  by the worse performance of the US in dealing with the virus.  The trade balance adjustment is also consistent with the results in Table 18, which shows the  change in real effective exchange rates. A rise in the real effective exchange rate is an  appreciation. Those countries losing capital experience a depreciation and those attracting  capital experience an appreciation.  8 Table 19 contains results for inflation defined as the change in the consumer price index. For  5 - 1 some  countries,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  is  mildly  inflationary,  and  for  others,  it  is  :  0 2 deflationary.  Even more interesting is that for some sectors in some countries, relative prices  0 2 y  may rise and in other sectors, relative prices may fall. The key is whether demand falls by more  l u J than supply due to the disruptions to production. If demand falls by more than supply in some  3  2 sectors or some countries the inflation will fall. If supply falls by more than demand, then  9,  3 inflation can initially rise. What matters for inflation over time is the response of central banks.  s  c i In the model, all central banks follow Henderson-McKibbin-Taylor type monetary rules and  m o inflation eventually returns to baseline. Central banks cut interest rates in response to the  n o c pandemic (Table 20). Fiscal deficits are eventually contained through a lumpsum tax on  E d  households. In practice countries may not follow these sensible monetary rules or maintain  i v o C fiscal solvency in which case the results can be very different over time.  Table 20 contains results for short-term real interest rates across all countries and Table 21  shows the change in the real return on ten-year bonds for all countries. The short-term interest  rate falls sharply. This sharp drop in interest rates is mostly due to the response of monetary  authorities that loosen monetary policy quickly. We do not impose a zero-lower bound on the  nominal policy interest rate. We treat negative nominal rates as if they are shadow policy rates  becoming negative to reflect the range of policies, including loan guarantees that different  central banks follow to stabilise the economy. Note that the real rate on ten-year bonds (Table  21) falls by much less than short-term real interest rates, so there is a steepening of the real  yield curve. Short interest rates recover over time. The long-term real interest rate encompasses  the expected future path of short real interest rates.

It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major  structural change to the world economy and that the pattern of recovery in the scenarios  considered in this paper does not ensue. Scenarios 1-4 imply an eventual recovery of the global  economy, whereas scenario 5 implies the persistence of higher risk, which causes the countries  to have a permanent output loss. In this paper, we do not consider any major benefits of the  implementation of new technologies that may follow the recovery to the COVID-19 pandemic.  McKibbin and Triggs (2018) use the same model as in this paper to consider a range of global  productivity scenarios unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic but which is illustrative of how  different the world evolves depending on productivity changes due to technology.  8 In this section, we will focus on results for Australia to explain the economic adjustments over  5 - 1 time. The economic story is similar for all countries given the initial differences for 2020  :  0 2 discussed above. A complete set of all dynamic results for all countries are available on the  0 2 y  Dashboard.  l u J 3  Figure 17 shows the dynamic path of Real GDP, real consumption, real investment and the  2 9,  trade balance. It is clear, that as the pandemic worsens across the scenarios, the falls in year 1  3 s  GDP, consumption and investment increase. It takes three years on average for real GDP to  c i m return to the pre COVID-19 baseline under most scenarios. Under scenario 5, in which there is  o n a permanent change in risk, Australian GDP (and that of all other countries) never returns to  o c E baseline. One exception to the more substantial falls across scenarios is the Australian trade  d  i v balance, which worsens by less as the pandemic worsens. This result is not surprising as the  o C world economy is increasingly negatively impacted; the impact on the Australian economy,  which is exposed to global trade becomes less attractive as an investment destination. Figure  18 contains results for the other key macroeconomic variables: employment, inflation, the real  short-term interest rate and the real effective exchange rate.   Figures 19 and 20 show the sectoral output and employment results for energy, mining,  agriculture, durable manufacturing, non-durable manufacturing and services. All sectors are  negatively impacted by the sharp reduction in demand and supply except for energy output  because the fall in energy prices increases energy use. Services and non-durable manufacturing  have larger output and employment losses. In the case of a permanent rise in global risk  (Scenario 5), there is a permanent structural change induced by the pandemic. Higher risk  means a lower global capital stock and those sectors that feed heavily into investment activities  such as durable manufacturing and mining experience permanent relative contractions.

There  is still enormous uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic, whether a vaccine will  be available and effective in the near term, and whether countries will change their policies in  response to the economic adjustments already experienced, if new waves of the pandemic  emerged. There is no doubt that COVID-19 is a significant negative shock to the world  economy. The health policy responses and the economic policy responses have been very  different across countries. As a result, some countries have done much better in responding to  the pandemic. It is also very likely that there will be future waves of COVID-19 just as there  were waves of the 1918/19 flu pandemic. The basis of the scenarios explored in this paper  8 5 - revolve around how many future waves there might be and how countries will respond to those  1 0:  outbreaks in terms of public health responses and changes in economic policies.  2 0 2 y  Even under the first scenario, which assumes that the worst of COVID-19 is over by mid-2020,  l u J the global economy experiences a major recession in 2020. Some countries are impacted far  3  2 more than others. The results from this paper and recent IMF and World Bank forecasts make  9,  3 it clear that health and economic policies will have to be carefully designed and adapted to get  s  ic through the current phase of the pandemic. Withdrawing macroeconomic support and creating  m o ‘fiscal cliffs’ through setting expiration dates on critical fiscal support policies in economies is  n o c likely to worsen the uncertainty and increase the economic costs. Preventing countries from  E d  undertaking more substantial fiscal stimulus measures either through institutional arrangements  i v o C or by lack of access to financing also increase the cost of the pandemic. In McKibbin and Vines  (2020), we explore the benefits of an additional globally coordinated fiscal response for  constrained countries through G20 policy cooperation in the case of scenario 5 from this paper.  The gains (or avoided losses) are significant for the global economy.  While the short-term public health and macroeconomic policy responses are critical to the shape  of the world economy in 2020, the evolution of the global economy over future decades will  depend on longer-term policy decisions. As argued in McKibbin and Fernando (2020a &  2020b), investment in global public health, particularly in developing economies is a crucial  ingredient in avoiding future devastation from pandemics. The experience of pandemic  emergence over the past two decades shows that COVID-19 is not an isolated event. Given the  scientific knowledge about zoonotic diseases and emerging spillovers of viruses from current  hosts to humans, there is a strong case for investment in pandemic preparedness at the national    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS50 and global levels. Global cooperation is fundamental since pandemics do not respect borders.  Therefore, the institutional design at the global level is critical to success. A World Health  Organization, in some form, is vital to a cooperative global public health response. Also, the  role of the G20, as it was in the global financial crisis a decade ago, is critical. Design and  financing of macroeconomic policy responses will need to be better coordinated over the  coming years.  COVID-19 is one amongst many challenges that the world will face in the coming decades.  These  problems  include  ongoing  pandemics,  the  increasing  prevalence  of  antimicrobial  resistance and the need to deal with the impacts of climate change and the impact of transitional  policies to address climate change. The current experience with the COVID-19 pandemic has  revealed deep problems in existing institutions at the supernational level and within countries.  While policies need to be designed and implemented at the national level, for most foreseeable  8 5 - problems, there needs to be greater cooperation across countries. COVID-19 shows the folly of  1 0:  isolationist politics and policies when the natural world ignores artificial boundaries.  2 0 2 y      l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v o C   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS51 References    Aguiar, A., Chepeliev, M., Corong, E., McDougall, R., & van der Mensbrugghe, D.

Copyright: Eduardo Levy Yeyati and Luca Sartorio COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS60 Generalized lockdowns have been the first line of defense against the COVID-19 pandemic, but the  lengthening of the expected duration of the pandemic and the tax that labor restrictions impose on  the economy by strict quarantines have moved the consensus towards a “learning-to-live-with-the- COVID-19” mix of social distancing with widespread testing and tracing and localized suppression.  That said, the rigidity of isolation policies, as measured nationally by the Oxford Stringency Index  (OSI) compiled by the University of Oxford, continues to be high in many quarters, particularly in  emerging and developing countries, increasing the already high social and economic costs of the  pandemic (Figures 1a and 1b)1.  1 7 - 9 5 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v o C   1 The data of this article is taken from the CEPE-DiTella COVID program database and is available upon  request.

However, the ultimate incidence of the lockdown  is intimately related to its impact on actual mobility, particularly workplace mobility, which is mostly  associated with closed common spaces and public transportation and thus more likely to influence  the spread. Indeed, a point to highlight is that residential mobility often correlates negatively with  workplace mobility –and in most countries increased with the lockdown– as it works as a  compensatory escape valve (Figure 3). This suggests that strict lockdowns on productive activities  are partially “diluted” in non-productive activities. Additionally, workplace mobility is likely the one  most closely related to the economic costs of the pandemic. As a result, a measure of total mobility,  by averaging both types, may underestimate the health and economic impact of the lockdown.  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS65 Figure 3.

To compare the evolution of de jure and de facto  v o lockdowns at the national level across countries (Figures 4a and 4b), we normalize the GMI to zero  C for the week from March 3rd to March 10th to avoid an unnecessary bias in countries in the Southern  Hemisphere, where labor mobility falls during the holiday season in January.

First, with the exception of North America, government-imposed lockdowns were  E d  tighter and more sustained during the course of the epidemic in emerging and developing  i v economies. However, despite the de jure restrictions, de facto labor mobility grew steadily over  o C time: for instance, current activity in work areas in Asia and Africa is even higher than in Europe  despite having stricter legal lockdowns.   To estimate the degree and evolution of compliance in each country, we normalize the OSI to zero  on March 3rd, 2020 and subtract it from the normalized GMI. As can be seen, non-compliance with  lockdown policies increased over time and was higher in developing economies, particularly in Africa  and Latin America (Figure 5).

Is a sustained tightening of the quarantine going forward still viable? The question is doubly relevant  to developing countries in the South: 1) the winter season heightens the circulation risk and puts  pressure on the capacity of local governments to relax mobility restrictions; 2) precarious labor  markets (largely comprised of independent or informal workers) and poor and overcrowded  habitats deepen the welfare impact of lockdowns and limit governments´ income support programs  and stay-at-home campaigns (Levy Yeyati and Valdés, 2020). Not surprisingly, compliance correlates  with per capita income and labor precariousness in urban centers (Figures 6a and 6b).  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS69 Figure 6.

What next? A socially and economically viable transition  The previous findings identify the multiple dimensions behind the lockdown fatigue (time,  stringency, precariousness, income) highlighting the practical limits of implementing stringent social  distancing policies in developing countries with dual labor markets and a considerable portion of  the population living in congested neighborhoods with poor habitats. This suggests that, moving  1 7 forward, lockdowns will likely be increasingly ineffective –especially in low and middle-income  - 9 countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America that still have strict restrictions in place. Additionally,  5 :  this also hints at the difficulty of resorting to new lockdowns in the event of a second wave: none of  0 2 the 120 countries in our database has so far reestablish equally strong restrictions on labor mobility  0 2 after they have been lifted.  y  l u References  J 3  2 Deb, P., D.

Our empirical strategy exploits  1 - the plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of the first COVID-19  2 7 :  diagnosis across regions in the United States. We find that the first local  0 2 diagnosis leads to an immediate increase in racist Google searches and  0 2 Twitter posts, with the latter mainly due to existing Twitter users posting  y  l the slur for the first time. This increase could indicate a rise in future hate  u J 3  crimes as we document a strong correlation between the use of the slur  2 9,  and anti-Asian hate crimes using historic data. Moreover, we find that the  3 rise in animosity is directed at Asians rather than other minority groups  s  c and is stronger in hours and on days when the connection between the  i m disease and Asians is more salient, as proxied by the number of President  o n Trump’s  tweets  mentioning  China  and  COVID-19  simultaneously.  In  o Ec contrast, the negative economic impact of the pandemic plays little  d  role in the initial increase in racial animus. Our results suggest that de- i v o emphasizing the connection between the disease and a particular racial  C group can be effective in curbing current and future racial animus. 1  We are grateful for the support and guidance from Eli Berman, Julie Cullen, Gordon Dahl.

Introduction Racialanimuscanaﬀectwelfareinmeasurableways,aseconomistshavenotedsincetheseminal work of Becker (1957). Recent papers have shown that racial animus can hinder economic devel- opment, aﬀectpoliticalinstitutions, andinducesocialunrest.1 Topreventfurtherfuelingofracial animusandreduceitsdamagetosociety,itisfundamentaltorigorouslyidentifyhowracialanimus formsandspreads. Thecoronavirus(COVID-19)pandemicprovidesanaturalexperimentallowingustostudywhy and how racial animus against certain groups can rise rapidly. It has long been argued that the risk of infection can foster xenophobia (Schaller and Neuberg, 2012). While COVID-19 may have 8 0 originated in China, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has emphasized that 1 2- people of Asian descent are at no greater risk of spreading the virus than are other Americans. 7 :  Nonetheless, since the outbreak of the virus, multiple incidents of Asian Americans being verbally 0 2 0 or physically attacked have been reported by major news outlets,2 and hundreds more have been 2 y  recorded by organizations that track hate incidents (Mullis and Glenn, 2020). These are telltale l u 3 J signs that the current pandemic may have sparked racial animus against Asians. The challenge is 2 9,  tomeasureandunderstandthisphenomenonrigorouslyandexpediently. 3 In this paper, we exploit variation in the timing of the ﬁrst local COVID-19 diagnosis across s  c i regions in the United States to causally identify how infectious diseases can trigger racial animus m o n againstAsians. Wefocusonthetimingoftheﬁrst COVID-19diagnosisfortworeasons. First,the o c ﬁrst diagnosis in an area represents a salient increase in the infection risk. Lab experiments have E d  shown that a more salient threat of infectious diseases leads to stronger xenophobia (Faulkner et i v o al., 2004). Second, the exact timing of the ﬁrst diagnosis is plausibly exogenous; whether an area C hasitsﬁrstdiagnosisthisweekorthenextislargelyunpredictableandisunlikelytobecorrelated withotherfactorsthatsimultaneouslychangelocalracialanimus.3 To proxy for an area’s racial animus against Asians, we use the percentage of Google searches 1Forexample,theracialwagegap,residentialracialsegregation,thecostsofbeingminoritypoliticalcandidates, andthedeathofGorgeFloydandtheresultingprotestsacrosstheUnitedStatescanallﬁndtheirrootsmoreorless inracismorracialanimus(CharlesandGuryan,2008;Cardetal.,2008;Stephens-Davidowitz,2014;BBC,2020). 2For example, anti-Asian incidents have been reported on NBC News (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/ asian-america/video-shows-passenger-defending-asian-woman-facing-racism-new-york-n1162296), New York Times (https://nyti.ms/3ccvHzO), and USA Today (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/ 2020/05/20/coronavirus-hate-crimes-against-asian-americans-continue-rise/5212123002/). 3PaperslikeEgorovetal.

This proxy can capture hidden racial animus because searches are mostly private and unlikely to suﬀer from social censoring. This proxy has since been used to measure racial animus in papers such as Depetris-Chauvin (2015) and has been shown to have a positive relationship with economic downturnandanti-AfricanAmericanhatecrimes(Andersonetal.,2020). Tocapturepublicdisplay of racial animus, we use a proxy based on public tweets, which has been used by Nguyen et al. (2018),amongothers,tomeasuresentimenttowardsminorities. 8 0 1 We focus on the use of the c-word, the most salient and unambiguously pejorative racial slur - 2 7 againstpeopleofAsiandescent,toproperlycaptureracialanimusagainstAsiansandtoavoiddata :  0 mining.4 Googlesearchesandtweetsincludingtheepithetaremostlynegative. “Chinkedeye” and 2 0 2 “chink virus” are common terms in such Google queries, and over 53.4 percent of such tweets are y  ul categorizedasshowing“anger” or“disgust” betweenNovember2019andApril2020.

Our ﬁndingsalsobroadlyrelatetoagrowingbodyofliteratureontheroleofsocialmediainpropagating animosityagainstminorities(Bursztynetal. 2020;MüllerandSchwarz,2020). Next, we turn our attention to the factors that fuel racial animus. First, fear of infectious diseases could motivate racial animus. Evolutionary psychologists have argued that the desire to avoid harmful communicable diseases contributes to contemporary prejudices against subjective 8 0 1 outgroups(SchallerandNeuberg,2012). Second,thesalienceoftheconnectionbetweenCOVID-19 - 2 7 and the Asian population is also a key factor. We ﬁnd that the increase in animus is directed at :  0 Asiansratherthanotherminoritygroups.

Third,weﬁndlittle 2 9,  evidencethatthenegativeeconomicimpactofthepandemicmotivatestheinitialincreaseinracial 3 s  animus. Areas with a more severe economic impact from the pandemic do not exhibit a higher c i m increase in racial animus than do those with a less severe impact.

Earlier studies were mostly correlational and based on surveys (e.g., Kim et al., 2016) or were conducted onlyinlabsettings(Faulkneretal.,2004;O’Sheaetal. 2020). Wecontributebyprovidingcausal evidence that fear of infectious diseases and its link to a certain group lead to animus against the COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS76 group,whiletheeconomicimpactofthediseaseplaysaweakerroleinthecurrentpandemic. Our paper also contributes to the emerging literature on the relationship between COVID-19 and racial attitudes online and oﬄine. Most papers are descriptive or correlational. For instance, Schild et al. (2020) characterize the evolution of Sinophobic slurs in the wake of the pandemic, Lyu et al. (2020) compare the characteristics of Twitter users who use or do not use controversial terms when talking about the pandemic, and Ziems et al. (2020) characterize how counter-hate speech can mitigate the spread of racial hate related to COVID-19 on Twitter. One exception is thepaperbyBartošetal. (2020).

We begin by presenting the relationship between the proxies and anti-Asian hate crimes. Hate crime data come from the FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and are available up to 2018. Over 80 percent of the U.S. population is covered by police agencies that voluntarily report hate crimedatatoUCR(RyanandLeeson,2011).

Onaverage,aone-standard-deviationincreaseintheraciallychargedsearchindex (i.e., 29.6) is linked to an approximately 15 percent (= 29.6×0.00019/0.03746) increase in the 8 0 1 average monthly anti-Asian hate crime rate in each media market each month.

The Eﬀects of Covid-19 on Local Racial Animus We start by examining how an area’s search for the c-word on Google responds to the ﬁrst local COVID-19 diagnosis. Figure 2, panel A plots the estimates of the coeﬃcients on the event dummies from regression 2 using an area’s racially charged Google search index as the outcome. Thesearchindexreachesthepeakintheweekaftertheﬁrstlocaldiagnosisanddecreasesslightly in later weeks. Table A3, panel A reports the regression results.

COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS84 be interpreted as a percentage of an area’s maximum search rate in the sample period. Therefore, compared to the week before the ﬁrst COVID-19 diagnosis, an area’s racially charged search rate on average increases by 22.6 percent of the area’s maximum search rate over the sample period in theﬁrstweekafterthediagnosisandremainsatleast15percentuntilsixweeksafterward.14 Given ourﬁndingsinTable1,theincreaseinthesearchindexinthefourweeksaftertheﬁrstCOVID-19 diagnosiscorrespﬂoatondstoanincreaseof0.0033(0.0002×(22.63+16.95+8.16+19)/4)inanti- Asianhatecrimespermillionresidents,or10percentoftheaveragemonthlyanti-Asianhatecrime ratebetween2014and2018. Wealsopresentestimatesusingvariousrescaledsearchindexes. Wedosobecausetheestimates using the original search index do not map to an increase over a national base. As detailed in 8 0 1 Appendix A, rescaling will drop media markets whose racially charged search rate is zero on the - 2 7 benchmark date when the base search rate occurs. To alleviate concern over sample selection, :  0 we present results using search indexes rescaled by three diﬀerent bases, i.e., Huntsville-Decatur 2 0 2 (Florence)’ssearchrateonMarch15,2020,WilkesBarre-Scranton’ssearchrateonMarch29,2020, y  ul andBuﬀalo’ssearchrateonApril5,2020. Wechoosethesebenchmarkdatesandbasesearchrates J 3  so as to back out rescaled search indexes for as many media markets as possible. We are able to 2 9,  back out rescaled search indexes for 35, 29 and 29 media markets, using each of the above base 3 s  search rate respectively. Combined, they cover 50 media markets.

To better understand how public expression of the c-word changes, we turn our attention to Twitter. Similar to the Google search index, the racially charged Twitter index also peaks in the weekaftertheﬁrstlocalCOVID-19diagnosisandslowlydecreasesafterward,asplottedinFigure2, panelB.TableA4,panelBfurthershowsthatrelativetotheweekbeforetheﬁrstdiagnosis,racially COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS86 chargedtweetsincreaseby1and0.6per100,000“the” tweetsintheﬁrstandthesecondweeksafter theﬁrstdiagnosis.

Theestimatedeﬀectschangeonlyslightly. To understand the timing when the usage of the c-word starts to change, we run regression 2 using the daily search index and post index as outcomes and additionally control for day-of-week ﬁxed eﬀects. As shown in Figure A4, the eﬀects start to appear two to three days after the ﬁrst localdiagnosis,implyingthatittakessometimeforthelocalstoobtainandreacttothenews. 8 0 1 There may be concern that the increase in the usage of the c-word is driven by reasons other - 2 7 than higher animosity against Asians, such as an increase in online activities due to blanket stay- :  0 at-home orders, a rise in benign attention to China or Asia, seasonality in racist online activities, 2 0 2 or“Twitterbots”.

Finally,theremaybeconcernthat“Twitterbots” ratherthan o C local residents contribute to the increase in racially charged tweets. However, Twitter proactively identiﬁes and removes automation-generated content (Roth and Pickles, 2020). In addition, based on30milliontweetspostedbetweenJanuary15,2020andApril17,2020,Ziemsetal.

First, ifthesalientconnectionisnotamaindrivingforce,thedisease-avoidancetheorywouldpredictrising animus against all minorities, not just Asians. We construct the Google search index and Twitter post index for common racial epithets against major minority groups in the United States, such as“nigger(s)” againstAfricanAmericans,“wetback(s)” againstHispanics,and“kike(s)"againstthe Jewish population.18 We run regression 2 using racially charged searches and tweets against these minorities as outcomes. We include an indicator for the week of January 26, 2020, when using the n-word as the outcome because Kobe Bryant’s death together with an MSNBC anchor using the n-word when broadcasting the news of the death led to a spike in its use. We also include an indicator for the week of February 23, 2020, when using the k-word as the outcome because 8 0 1 the Los Angeles Dodgers player Enrique ("Kiké") Hernandez’s performance in that week led to a - 2 7 spike in the use of the k-word. Coeﬃcients on the event dummies are plotted in Figure A7. None :  0 of the examined racial epithets experience an increase in Google searches following the ﬁrst local 2 0 2 diagnosis; if anything, searches for the n-word demonstrate a slight decrease.

Conclusion In this paper, we estimate the eﬀect of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial animus. We ﬁnd that the ﬁrst local diagnosis leads to an immediate increase in Google searches and Twitter posts including the c-word. Most of the racist tweets discuss issues beyond COVID-19 and come from Twitter users posting the slur for the ﬁrst time. This can create a multiplier eﬀect on racial animusviapersuasionorbychangingthesocialnormsofpubliclyexpressinganti-Asiansentiment. Moreover, the increase in racist online activities may indicate a rise in oﬄine hate crimes as we documentastrongcorrelationbetweentheuseofthethec-wordandanti-Asianhatecrimesusing historic data.

Rescaled Google Search Index Google Trends reports the search index in either a time series or a cross-sectional format.

Introduction  The COVID-19 crisis has caused drastic changes to the work and domestic lives of many families  around the world. In England, millions of adults have lost work either temporarily or permanently, and  many more are predicted to follow. Others are newly working from home, while key workers are  experiencing increased demand for work outside the home that carries high health risks. Parents are  facing especially challenging circumstances as schools and childcare facilities closed down and they  were left with the full responsibility of caring for and educating their children from home.   In the early days of the crisis many hypothesised that COVID-19’s effects on work, both paid and  domestic, may differ starkly by gender in ways that earlier economic downturns did not (Alon et al.  2020, Hupkau and Petrongolo 2020). However, the direction of these effects is still ambiguous. For  instance, back in February the locked-down sectors of the economy disproportionately employed  women, putting their jobs at particularly high risk (Joyce and Xu 2020). On the other hand, women  were also more likely than men to be key workers or to work in occupations that can be done from  8 3 home, two traits that contribute to keeping their jobs safe (Blundell et al. 2020). Among parents, mothers  1 - are traditionally the main providers of childcare and accumulate a disproportionate amount of  9 0 housework (Gimenez-Nadal and Sevilla, 2012). It seems natural to assume that they will shoulder most  1 :  of the additional domestic responsibilities created by the pandemic crisis. But if fathers do take on some  0 2 of the additional domestic responsibilities, even if not to the same extent as mothers, it may help  0 2 accelerate changes in norms and attitudes towards more balanced gender roles.  y  l u J This paper is one of the first to shed light on these effects. We use newly collected data to describe,  3  2 during the initial stages of COVID-19, how the crisis is affecting mothers and fathers in two-parent  9,  opposite-gender families.  We describe how the labour market outcomes of mothers and fathers are  3 s  responding to the crisis as well as how parents are dividing their time between childcare, housework  c and paid work during the lockdown. Where possible, we use the 2014/15 UK Time Use Survey to  i m provide comparable pre-crisis estimates. We go onto examine gender asymmetries in responses to the  o n crisis, using the shock to examine whether gender gaps in the allocation of domestic and paid work  o c responsibilities can be explained by comparative advantage in the labour market. To investigate this  E d  hypothesis we study heterogeneity in the division of household responsibilities by both partners’ labour- i v market circumstances, both in terms of the relative earnings of partners prior to the crisis and in terms  o C of shocks related to COVID-19.1   We find that hours of paid work have fallen dramatically during the lockdown period for both mothers  and fathers. The average parent in our sample (including those not working for pay) is now working for  pay during just three hours a day; in 2014/15 the comparable figure was 6 ½ hours. However, mothers’  paid work has shrunk proportionally more than fathers’, both in terms of working status and hours of  work among those actively in work. In 2014/15, mothers were in paid work at 80% of the rate of fathers;  the comparable figure has now dropped to 70%. Mothers in paid work used to work an average of 73%  of the hours that fathers worked; this has fallen to 68%. Moreover, the quality of time at work matters  for productivity and learning, which in turn may impact future earnings and career progression. Multi- tasking and interruptions are key deterrents of productivity during time at work. Indeed recent evidence  suggests that task juggling can result in losses of productivity and earnings (Adams-Prassl 2020;  Coviello et al. 2014). To gain insight into how the crisis is affecting the productivity of parents at work,    1   Single parents face different challenges around how to meet, often on their own, the increased childcare and housework  responsibilities the crisis has created. Studying single parents raises specific issues that we do not address in this report.  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS111 we measure how much uninterrupted paid work they do. We find that mothers and fathers doing paid  work used to be interrupted during the same proportion of their work hours before the crisis; now  mothers are interrupted over 50% more often.   This adds up to a particularly bleak picture of how mothers’ work has held up. Overall, in 2014/15, the  average mother (including those who did not work for pay) was doing nearly 60% of the number of  uninterrupted work hours that the average father did; now she is doing only 35%.  Past research shows  that the time women take off when having a child, and the reduction in hours once they return to work,  have long-term effects, reducing their future hourly wages (Blundell et al. 2016). There is a risk,  therefore, that the differences we find in how the work hours of fathers and mothers are being affected  by this crisis will contribute to accentuating gender gaps in career progression and earnings.  The gender differences in paid work during this crisis are counterbalanced by unequal gender responses  in domestic responsibilities to the large shock to childcare provision due to school and childcare  closures. Mothers are doing a greater share of housework and childcare than fathers are, coming to  8 around 2 hours more per day of each.2 However, these gaps between mothers and fathers time-use are  3 1 not straightforwardly explained by mothers’ lower employment rates or lower earnings. Indeed, gender  - 9 0 gaps in time use remain even when comparing mothers and fathers currently working for pay, or  1 :  mothers and fathers not currently in paid work.   0 2 0 We exploit the variation across couples in terms of asymmetric labour market shocks to check whether  2 y  the division of domestic work are driven by relative opportunity costs of partners as economic  l u household models would predict (Chiappori 1988; Chiappori 1992; Becker 1965). If specialization in  J 3  the family is a response to the economic incentives that couples face, then we would expect that fathers  2 9,  assume the primary role at home in couples where the mother is the main earner or where only her job  3 remains active.   s  c i m We examine whether this is the case in two ways. First, by comparing the division of domestic and paid  o n work in families where either the mother or the father are the primary earners prior to the crisis and  o c both remain in work during lockdown; and second, by looking at the allocation of domestic work  E d  between partners when one partner stopped working, depending on the gender of that partner. We find  i that mothers still do more childcare and the same amount of housework as their partner even when they  v o were the primary earner in the family prior to the crisis. Moreover, mothers who have stopped working  C for pay during lockdown while their partner continues to work do twice as much childcare and  housework as their partner. But in families where the father has stopped working, the parents share  childcare and housework equally, while the mother also does an average of 5 hours of paid work a day.  We conclude that evidence from this shock does not support the hypothesis that comparative advantage  in the labour market explains why mothers do so much more domestic chores than fathers.  While the average gender-disparity in domestic work remains large, we find that fathers’ participation  in childcare has seen a huge proportional increase from its pre-crisis levels. Whereas, on an average  school day in 2014/15, the average father in two-parent opposite-gender households did some childcare  during 4 hours of the day, this has doubled under lockdown to 8 hours. To what extent this increase    2 Our results are consistent with what Adams-Prassl et al. 2020a and Sevilla and Smith (2020) found for the UK, and with  similar estimates for Spain by Farre and Gonzalez (2020)  and for Italy by Del Boca et al.  (2020).  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS112 persists as lockdown comes to an end is perhaps the biggest unknown in what the long-run effects of  COVID-19 on gender equality in the labour market will be.   Our paper contributes to the recent literature using real-time data to document that women do more  childcare and housework than men during the COVID19 pandemic. Adams-Prassl et al. (2020a) asked  men and women to report hours spent looking after children and home-schooling during lockdown in  the UK. They find that women do approximately an hour and a half more childcare per workday than  men, but there is no analysis of the relationship with employment. Sevilla and Smith (forthcoming)  directly compare the allocation of childcare within the same household before and after lockdown, and  show that women who do a greater share of home childcare pre-COVID-19 are more likely not to be  working during COVID-19. Farre and Gonzalez (2020) use a self-selected sample of Spanish  households to show that there has been a shift to a more equal distribution of housework (driven mainly  by men taking responsibility for shopping) and childcare. Daniela Del Boca, Noemi Oggero, Paola  Profeta, Mariacristina Rossi  (2020) use data on a representative sample of 800 Italian working women  collected before and during the emergency to compare the number of hours spent at work, on housework  8 and childcare before the emergency (April and July 2019) to the hours spent during the first three  3 1 months of the emergency (April 2020). They find that most of the additional responsibilities have fallen  - 9 0 to women, though childcare activities are shared more equally than housework. Compared to previous  1 :  studies, we analyse time- use data for each hour slot in the day and find that women are doing childcare  0 2 during more hours of the day than men (during ten of the hour-long slots compared to eight). We  also  0 2 look at how childcare relates to employment and find that men’s childcare is more sensitive to their  y  employment.   l u J 3  The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we discuss our survey, sample and methods of  2 9,  analysis.  In section 3 we provide descriptives of parents’ paid work before moving onto descriptives  3 of timeuse in section 4. In section 5, we examine the extent to which the patterns we find can be  s  c straightforwardly explained by gender differences in employment rates and pre-crisis earnings.

Sample, Survey and Analysis    Sample    We surveyed 4,915 parents in England who lived with their children between 29 April and 15 May  2020. In particular, to be eligible for inclusion, parents had to be living with (at least one) child in one  of eight different school years.3 These school years corresponded (roughly) to having a child aged  between 4 and 15.   Our sample is limited to opposite-gender two-parent households, of which we have 3,591 in the data.  While this group include the majority of parents, this work is not necessarily representative of how  parents as a whole are experiencing lockdown.  The analysis does not include single parents, who make  up 14.8% of families in England.4 Single parents are likely to face particular challenges due to even  more-exacerbated time pressures (Cattan et al. 2020). Since most single-parent households are headed  8 3 by women, this is particularly important for how the crisis will affect mothers and fathers differently.  1 9- Likewise, the analysis does not include households with two parents of the same gender, who typically  0 1 divide up responsibilities differently from opposite-gender parents (Andresen and Nix 2019). Both  :  groups merit specific and careful analysis.5  0 2 0 2 Survey  y  l   u J Participants were recruited through a well-reputed online survey company and received a small payment  3  2 in compensation for their time. We ensured that respondents were diverse in terms of their gender,  9,  education, region, marital status, work status and the job they did.   3 s  c i The main aim of our survey was to collect detailed information on how families and children spend  m o their time on a term-time weekday. We asked the surveyed parent and their partner to fill in an online  n o time-use diary, telling us what activities they did during each hour of the day. We also asked the  c E surveyed parent to fill in a similar diary about their child’s time use (selecting one child at random in  d  multi-child families), and asked who the child was with during each time slot. Finally, we collected  i v information about the types of home learning activities children are doing, what resources have been  o C provided by the school and what resources are available at home for learning.   In order to keep the survey a manageable length for families, we asked about time use in one-hour slots.  Since these are wider than the 10-minute intervals used in the most detailed time-use surveys, such as  the 2015 UK Time Use Survey, we cannot say precisely how long respondents spent on a particular  activity; respondents could report multiple activities during the hour, so the apparent number of hours    3   We interviewed parents with children entering Reception next year and those with children in school in Reception and in  Years 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10.  4   https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/  familiesandhouseholds/2019.  5   While the size of this data set is sufficient to carry out a detailed analysis of how opposite-gender two-parent households  (the majority group) are experiencing the crisis, the size limits our ability to conduct specific analysis of these two  important groups that addresses the particular challenges each may be facing. As larger data sets collected during the  crisis are released (for example, the Understanding Society panel), more analysis of these groups will be possible.  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS114 might overstate how long the respondent spent on the activities in that category. Instead, we comment  on the number of one-hour slots during which doing at least some of a particular activity is reported.  Analysis    While we comment at points on the ways in which our data appear consistent, or inconsistent, with  theoretical ideas and past empirical evidence on household organisation, all analysis we present in this  paper is descriptive. We present average time use across mothers and fathers and, at various points, also  split by other dimensions of heterogeneity (for example, past relative earnings or which partner  experienced job loss during the crisis).   Table 1 presents basic descriptives of the prior economic situation of the families in our sample. To  examine the representativeness of our sample across these characteristics, we constructed a sample of  respondents from the nationally representative 2019 Labour Force Survey (LFS) who were roughly  equivalent to our population of interest: parents with at least one child between the ages of 2 and 15.6  8 Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1 show means for this nationally representative sample and for our sample.  3 1 We see that our sample systematically contains larger proportions of higher earners and more-educated  - 9 0 individuals than does the LFS. Importantly, we also see that our unweighted sample contains a higher  1 :  proportion of individuals who work in industries that have been locked down during the crisis.   0 2 0 Therefore, so that our analysis is representative of the situation in England as a whole, we reweight our  2 y  sample by key characteristics to ensure that it better matches the distribution of characteristics observed  l u in the LFS. In particular, we reweight on: family structure, women’s education, men’s education, prior  J 3  (pre-pandemic) employment, women’s 2019 pre-tax earnings, men’s 2019 pre-tax earnings, women’s  2 9,  industry ( particularly whether they work in an industry where more than 50% of jobs have been locked  3 down), men’s industry (ditto), women’s occupation (particularly whether working from home is  cs  possible), men’s occupation (ditto), and geographic region.7 To do this, we pool our data with the LFS  i m sample and use regression analysis to calculate appropriate weights. We truncate our weights at the 10th  no and 90th percentiles to prevent our analysis being overly sensitive to a few observations.   o c E Column 3 of the table shows means for the reweighted sample. We see that the average characteristics  d  i of this reweighted sample are now very similar to the nationally representative LFS sample.  v o Reassuringly, the reweighted sample also matches various moments well that we didn’t directly  C reweight on.         6   The LFS only has information on children’s ages in groups, meaning that we were not able to select households with  children of the exact ages that would make them eligible for our survey.   7   The share of jobs in an industry subject to the lockdown and the share of jobs in each occupation that can be done from  home are calculated using the methods set out in Costa-Dias et al.

Parents’ paid work under lockdown  We begin by examining some basic descriptives of parents’ paid work by gender during the lockdown.  COVID-19 has brought an unprecedented disruption to working patterns, changing who is in paid work  and where, when and how they are working. Of the parents in our (reweighted) sample who were doing  some paid work during February 2020, only 54% were still engaging in paid work at the time of the  survey. 13% were no longer working for pay due to having lost their job permanently (through being  laid off, being fired or quitting), while another 32% of parents were no longer working for pay due to  having been furloughed through the UK government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.   So far, there are no conclusive statistics on the rate of furloughing or of job loss and the statistics that  do exist vary widely. Official estimates for the UK suggest that 23% of those who were working for  pay (employed or self-employed) before the crisis had been furloughed by mid May.8 However, a recent  online survey of the labour market suggested a much higher figure of 43%.b In all, the proportion of  parents in opposite-gender partnerships who were previously working that we estimate to have stopped  8 3 working due to having been furloughed (32%) lies between official figures and those from recent labour  1 9- market surveys.  0 1 :  Official information about how many people have lost their job is more scarce.9 Data scarcity,  0 2 differences in reference periods and the fact that we look at all those who have stopped working for pay  0 2 (due to being laid off, being fired or having quit) whereas the government figures that are available so  y  l far only relate to those claiming benefits due to unemployment (a narrower group) make it difficult to  u 3 J make comparisons with official figures at this stage. Our estimate of the proportion of parents no longer  2 working for pay (13% of those who were previously working) is similar to, but slightly lower than, in  9,  a recent labour market survey which estimated a figure of 15% (Adams-Prassl et al. 2020).  3 s  c i Importantly, our estimates of the prevalence of both furlough and stopping work for other reasons are  m o not directly comparable to either official statistics or recent labour market surveys: we focus on  n o opposite-gender, dual-parent households with dependent children in England, rather than all workers in  c E the UK. This could be particularly important since parents are able to ask to be furloughed because of  d    i v o 8 1 Official estimates report that 7.5 million (employee) jobs had been furloughed by 12 May  C (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-scheme-until-october). This compares with Office  for National Statistics (ONS) estimates, based on the Labour Force Survey, that there were 33.1 million in paid work in  the UK between December 2019 and February 2020 (ONS Dataset EMP01 SA, release date 19 May 2020).  9 A huge increase in the volume of claims made for benefits related to unemployment and financial hardship indicate the  unprecedented scale of the financial challenges facing households. During the first eight weeks after social distancing was  announced (on 16 March), there were 2.6 million individual ‘declarations’ from people applying for universal credit  benefits.c Not all these claims will, however, relate to new job loss. The government estimates that as of 9 April, three  weeks into social distancing, 856,000 more people than one month earlier were claiming benefits principally for the  reason of unemployment;d these numbers are likely to increase substantially as they are updated to cover a greater period  of the lockdown. They are also likely to underestimate the true extent of job losses as not all job losses will have resulted  in new benefit claims: some newly unemployed workers will already have been claiming universal credit so will not have  needed to make a new claim, others will not have met the eligibility criteria, while still more will have been entitled to  claim but will not have actually done so.  The difference in reference period (our data capture those who have stopped  working for pay up until mid May, a month later than the official estimates of new benefit claims for the principal reason  of unemployment) makes it difficult to compare our estimates with these official statistics.  c Department for Work and Pensions, ‘Universal Credit declarations (claims) and advances: management information’,  released 19 May 2020, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-declarations-claims-and-advances- management-information#history.  d Office for National Statistics, ‘Employment in the UK: May 2020’, released 19 May 2020,  https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/employme ntintheuk/may2020.  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS118 pandemic-related caring responsibilities, including childcare while schools are closed. Since our figures  apply only to parents with dependent children, they are less useful as indicators of the health (or lack  thereof) of the UK labour market as a whole. However, they do clearly indicate that parents with  dependent children have seen enormous disruption to their working patterns.   While it is early to say whether our figures on job loss and furlough among parents are precise estimates  of what is happening in the wider economy, in this report we focus on the differences in employment  and time use between fathers and mothers and across families, which are likely to be less sensitive to  potential sampling bias.  Differences by parents’ gender    We find important differences in the rates of job loss and of furloughing between mothers and fathers.  We see in Figure 1 that, among parents who were working in February 2020, mothers are indeed 9  percentage points more likely to have stopped working for pay than fathers. 16% of mothers are no  8 longer doing paid work due to having lost their work permanently (whether they were laid off, were  3 1 fired or quit), compared with 11% of fathers. Mothers are also somewhat more likely to not be doing  - 9 0 paid work due to having been furloughed through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (34%,  1 :  compared with 30% of fathers). These effects compound the already unequal employment rates of  0 mothers and fathers, which in our data were respectively 75% and 92% in February 2020 (very close to  2 0 the 75% and 93% in nationally representative data for April to June 2019).10 So, while prior to the crisis  2 y  mothers were in paid work at 80% of the rate that fathers were, now they are in paid work at only 70%  l u of the rate.   J 3  2 9,  These differences may arise through one of two channels, or a combination of the two. First, mothers  3 are more likely than fathers to work in the sectors that are taking the biggest hit from the lockdown  cs  (Alon et al. 2020; Joyce and Xu 2020). This aspect is different from in previous recessions, in which  i m male-dominated sectors suffered the most (Doepke and Tertilt 2016).   o n o c Second, the COVID-19 crisis has been distinguished by the sudden, near-total loss of access to schools  E and childcare, leaving parents with enormous additional responsibilities for childcare and education.  d  i Since mothers already spent more time on childcare and other unpaid work (Cattan et al. 2020), and  v o since in many couples the woman is the lower earner, it is possible that these additional responsibilities  C are being disproportionately shouldered by mothers.    10  See ONS, ‘Families and the labour market, UK: 2019’,  https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/familiesandt helabourmarketengland/2019. These employment rates are also consistent with findings from other surveys recently  collected for the UK (e.g. (Adams-Prassl et al. 2020; Sevilla and Smith 2020))  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS119 Figure 1. Current engagement in paid work by gender for parents who were in paid work in  February 2020  8 3 1 9-   0 1 If those who have stopped paid work during the crisis find it difficult to return in the short term, either  :  0 because low labour demand coupled with high overall levels of unemployment makes it hard to find a  2 0 job or because their other commitments remain incompatible with paid work, these initial inequalities  2 y  could persist beyond this crisis through the loss of skills and labour market attachment leading to long- l u term increases in gender inequalities.   J 3    2 9,  D  ifferences by parents’ education qualifications  3 s  The lockdown has also opened up inequalities between education groups, as Figure 2 highlights.  c mi Amongst both mothers and fathers, individuals with fewer qualifications are more likely to have stopped  o paid work since the start of the crisis. As has been discussed elsewhere (Costa-Dias et al. 2020), this  n o may well be because more-skilled jobs can be done from home more easily. For example, over three- c E quarters of university-educated parents in our data who are currently working are working from home,  d  compared with well under half of those with GCSE qualifications or below.   i v o C The gender inequalities in who has stopped working are clear within all three education groups: mothers  are always more likely to have stopped working than fathers, independent of their qualifications.  Strikingly, the gender gap is similar at the top and the bottom of the distribution of education: among  degree-educated parents, mothers are 9.2 percentage points more likely to have stopped work, while the  gap is 8.8 percentage points among those educated to GCSE level or below. The gap for the group with  A-level qualifications is around two-thirds as big again.   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS120 Figure 2.

Time Use under Lockdown  Changes in employment patterns are not the only way in which the lockdown is impacting how families  spend their time; most children now rely on their parents as their sole childcare and chief education  providers. In this section, we document how mothers and fathers are spending their time during  lockdown and who is shouldering these additional responsibilities.   In our survey, we asked the main respondent what activities they, their partner and one of their children  were doing during each hour of the previous weekday (the survey was paused over weekends and Bank  Holidays). The respondent could include more than one activity in each hour slot. For parents, the  activities we asked about were paid work, housework, leisure, exercise, personal care, ‘active’ childcare  (such as playing with a child or doing educational activities), ‘passive’ childcare (keeping an eye on a  child), caring for others (not children) and sleep.11 In this analysis, we combine active and passive  childcare into one childcare category, we combine ‘exercise’ and ‘leisure’ to create one exercise  category and we drop ‘caring for others’ due to the rarity with which this activity was selected. For  8 3 children, in addition to age-appropriate activities, we asked who was supervising them during each hour  1 9- and we use this information to cross-check the hours in which parents were doing passive childcare.  0 1 This leaves us with six different categories of activities during waking hours. In this section, we describe  0:  how, on average, all mothers and fathers (regardless of whether they worked prior to the crisis and  2 0 whether they are working now) have been spending their time.   2 y  l How are mothers and fathers spending their weekdays?  u 3 J   2 For each hour of the day, Figure 3 shows the share of mothers and fathers taking part in each of these  9,  six categories of activity. In some cases, Figure 3 shows few differences between men and women: their  3 s  sleeping patterns, time spent on personal care and leisure time look nearly identical.   c i m o But there are stark differences in time spent on paid work, housework and childcare. At all points in the  n o day, more men than women are doing paid work. For example, while around a fifth of mothers report  c E doing paid work between noon and 1pm, nearly two-fifths of fathers say they are working then. The  d  reverse is true for housework, with more women doing housework during every hour of the day. In  i v o childcare too, the gender difference is striking, particularly during core working hours; at noon, for  C example, around 70% of mothers were doing childcare compared with 50% of fathers.   These differences mean that mothers report spending at least some of their time on housework and  childcare in more hour-long slots during the day than their partners do. Figure 4 summarises these  findings, showing the total number of one-hour slots in which mothers and fathers report doing  childcare, housework and paid work.     11  In addition to respondents’ reports of passive childcare done by them and their partner, we also include hours in which  the respondent reported through the child time-use diary that they or their partner was supervising their child.   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS122 Figure 3. Mothers’ and fathers’ time use over the course of the day  8 3 1 - 9 0 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l   u J 3    2 9,  Figure 4. Total one-hour time slots reported by mothers and fathers  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v o C   Averaging across those currently doing paid work and those who are not, Figure 4 shows that, on  average, fathers report doing some paid work in four one-hour slots, two more than the average for  mothers. On the other hand, fathers report doing housework in just over two time slots, compared with  nearly four for mothers. There is a similar story for childcare, where mothers report doing childcare in  over ten one-hour slots and fathers do so in eight. Of course, one reason for these gender differences is  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS123 that – as Section 2 shows – men are more likely to remain in paid work during the crisis and, indeed,  are more likely to have been working for pay, particularly in full-time work, prior to the crisis. We  return to this in further detail below.  Gender differences in childcare    The differences in time spent on childcare, shown in Figure 4, are stark: on average, mothers are  engaged in some childcare – whether active or passive – in over 25% more hour-long slots than fathers.  But even for fathers, childcare is the activity that is most frequently reported during waking hours (see  Figure 3).12 This means that parents, especially mothers, are doing some childcare throughout the great  majority of their day.   To put these patterns into context, we now look at how these figures compare with the amount of  childcare that parents were doing prior to the crisis, using data from the UK Time Use Survey (UKTUS),  a nationally representative time-use survey carried out in 2014/15.13   8 3 1 Figure 5 shows that, on an average school day in 2014/15, fathers were engaged in childcare during 4.2  - 9 one-hour slots and mothers during 6.7 slots; the 8.0 and 10.3 one-hour slots in which, on average, fathers  0 1 and mothers report doing childcare over the last few weeks are thus very substantial increases. The  :  0 increase is particularly large for fathers, who have nearly doubled the number of slots in which they  2 0 engage in childcare. Such a sudden and significant change may have longer-run effects on how parents  2 y  share childcare going forward, even after lockdown, and on how employers view male employees’  l u childcare responsibilities.   J 3  2 9,  Of course, not all childcare requires the same level of effort from the parent; it could be much easier to  3 combine cooking with keeping an eye on a child while they watch TV than it is to combine writing  cs  work reports with playing Lego. Figure 5 therefore also breaks our measure of childcare into ‘active’  i m and ‘passive’ care. It shows that more than half (56% for mothers and 61% for fathers) of the time spent  o n looking after children is taken up with ‘passive childcare’ – keeping an eye on the children or watching  o c TV together, for example – rather than ‘active childcare’, such as doing schoolwork or playing together.   E d  i v o C   12  This is consistent with other recent surveys which also find large differences in the time spent on childcare by mothers  and fathers during the current crisis (e.g. Adams-Prassl et al. 2020; Sevilla and Smith 2020)   13  We run this analysis on a subsample of households with children of similar ages to those in our survey (focusing on  children from age 8, when child time-use diaries are first available, to age 15). We also recode data from the UKTUS to  make them as comparable as possible to ours by recoding the survey’s 10-minute intervals into hour-long intervals and  recoding whether the respondent did any childcare during that hour. Our measure of doing childcare in the UKTUS is  based on cross-checking the reports of when children say they were with parents against their parents’ diaries.

Active versus passive childcare and comparison with pre-lockdown time use  8 3 1 - 9 0 1 :  0 2   0 2 Note: 2014/15 figures use the UK Time Use Survey. This data set contains activity information down to 10-minute  y  slots of the day. We create a data set from this that indicates whether a parent did any childcare within a given  l u hour, to best mimic the methodology in our survey.  J 3  2 Quantity versus quality of work time  9,    3 s  The amount of paid work that parents can do depends not just on how long they spend working, but  c also on how productive they are during that time. Indeed, previous research has shown that the total  i m amount of working time and the total amount of focused, uninterrupted working time are both important  o n determinants of workers’ productivity and learning (Blundell et al. 2016; Coviello et al. 2015; Coviello  o c et al. 2014; Adams-Prassl 2020).   E d  vi However, for parents working from home, working time – and especially focused working time – can  o C be hard to come by. Parents, who are now largely responsible for both childcare and education around  the clock, are contending with more demands from their families on their time. And childcare,  particularly for younger children, is often not an activity that can be rigorously scheduled in focused  blocks of time.   In this section, we explore what the lockdown has meant for parents’ working patterns. Since we asked  respondents to list all of the activities they did in each one-hour slot, our data give us a clear picture of  the extent to which parents’ hours of paid work are being shared with – or interrupted by – other  responsibilities. To understand how this crisis is changing the quantity of working time, we compare  current figures with what similar parents used to do before the lockdown using the UK Time Use  Survey.  Figure 6 illustrates how much working patterns have changed for fathers and mothers. The top panel  shows the average number of hour-long slots dedicated to paid work before and during the crisis, for  all mothers and all fathers taken together. Overall, we find that fathers are doing paid work in fewer  than half the number of hours that average fathers used to work before the crisis. For mothers, the drop  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS125 is even more staggering; they are currently working in less than two-fifths of the number of hours that  similar mothers reported prior to the lockdown. In all, while in 2014/15 mothers who were doing paid  work were working 73% of the number of hours of fathers in paid work, now mothers are working only  68% of fathers’ hours.  Of course, these figures are partly driven by the large changes in employment status that we reported  in Section 2. Panel B in Figure 6 shows how working hours among the subgroup of parents who are  working for pay during the lockdown period compared with pre-lockdown figures for working parents.  It shows that substantial gender differences persist: while the working hours of fathers dropped by about  16%, those of mothers dropped by 22%.  8 3 1 - 9 0 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v o C COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS126 Figure 6.

This data set contains data down to 10-minute slots of the  day. We create a data set from this that indicates whether a parent did any paid work within a given hour, to best  mimic the methodology in our survey.  Figure 6 also shows the amount of parents’ paid work hours that are multitasking (or are interrupted),  defined as doing at least one work and one non-work activity during the hour-long slot. We see that,  before the crisis, parents typically did non-work activities during a quarter of the hours in which they  were also doing paid work. Such hours most typically occurred at the start and end of their workdays,  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS127 as they transitioned to and from work.14 We see that now, overall, parents who are currently working  for pay (Figure 6B) have a higher number of interrupted hours, both in absolute terms and as a fraction  of their total work hours. The nature of the interruptions is also different; during the lockdown, in  roughly 90% of interrupted work hours the parent is also doing childcare alongside his or her paid work.  Working time before the crisis was mostly spent in the workplace, where interruptions are likely to be  less frequent and less disturbing for the workflow. The increase in interruptions is therefore unsurprising  given many parents’ transition to doing their job from home with children out of school. The reduction  in the proportion of hours that parents work uninterrupted implies that the drop in the amount of work  that parents are able to do may be even more pronounced than suggested by the drop in working hours.  Our data confirm that indeed multitasking is less frequent among those parents working outside the  home, in which case it happens in 18% of work hours, compared with 49% for those working from  home.  Moreover, the extent of multitasking during work time is more prevalent among women than men.  While 70% of fathers’ work hours are spent exclusively doing work, this is the case for only 53% of  8 mothers’ work hours.15 In other words, mothers are being interrupted during 57% more of their paid  3 1 work hours than fathers. This was not the case before the crisis: then, mothers and fathers were  - 9 0 interrupted during the same proportion of their work hours. Combined with the gaps in hours spent  1 :  doing paid work, this amounts to the average father who is currently working for pay having nearly  0 2 twice as many uninterrupted work hours as the average mother who is currently working for pay (5.1  0 2 hours versus 2.6 hours). This is a bigger gap in uninterrupted hours than we saw before the crisis (6.6  y  hours for fathers versus 4.7 hours for mothers). Combined too with the fact that mothers are more likely  l u J to have stopped working for pay since the lockdown and that they were already less likely to be doing  3  so before the crisis, mothers overall (including those not working for pay at all) are working just over a  2 9,  third of the number of uninterrupted hours that fathers are.   3 s  c Taken together, we find that not only are mothers less likely to work during the lockdown, but also,  i m even if they are working, they spend fewer hours on paid work and the time they do spend working is  o n likely to be less productive than fathers’ work time because of interruptions. Lower productivity during  o c the time mothers spend on paid work – and being paid – could itself impact their career prospects,  E d  making them seem less committed to their jobs or less able to cope with their workloads than their male  vi colleagues.   o C     14  Commuting to and from paid work is included in our definition of hours spent doing some paid work.  15  These findings are unlikely to be driven by differences in reporting behaviour between men and women (e.g. women  being more likely to tick multiple boxes). Our analysis includes both the main respondent’s and his/her partner’s time  use. Since our main respondents are a mix of men and women, we have some mothers responding about fathers and some  fathers responding about mothers. We did not find systematic differences in gender gaps for reported time use by gender  of the main respondent.  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS128 5.  What drives differences in how mothers and fathers spend  their time?  So far, we have seen that mothers and fathers are spending their time very differently in the lockdown.  While men have significantly increased the time they spend on childcare, it is still mothers who are  taking on the bulk of childcare and housework responsibilities, often at the same time as they complete  other tasks. By contrast, fathers are doing much more paid work than mothers during the lockdown.  These results suggest that the adults in two-parent families are continuing – or intensifying – the  specialisation they had already developed before the pandemic, with one partner focusing more on paid  work while the other takes more responsibility for unpaid work at home.   Notably, this specialisation has been incentivised by policy during the pandemic: the Coronavirus Job  Retention Scheme means that couples where one parent stops doing paid work entirely and is  furloughed, while the other continues to work their regular hours, are financially much better off than  8 3 those  where  both  partners  reduce  their  working  hours  to  accommodate  their  new  domestic  1 - responsibilities. But noting that there are incentives in favour of specialisation within couples does not  9 0 answer why, on average, specialisation during the lockdown seems to split along gender lines, with  1 :  mothers spending more time on domestic responsibilities while fathers do more paid work. There could  0 2 be a number of reasons for this gendered division of labour, including:   0 2 y   Employment rates: As we have shown, fathers are more likely to be in paid employment than  l u J mothers. This was already true before the crisis – 75% of mothers were working between April and  3  June 2019, compared with 93% of fathers16 – but the differences are now even more pronounced.   2 9,  3  Hourly earnings: On average, fathers earn more than mothers; before the crisis, mothers whose first  s  c child was 5 years old earned more than 15% less per hour than fathers with a first child the same age,  i m and the gender wage gap continued to grow as the child got older (Costa Dias et al. 2018). This means  o n that an extra hour that a father spends doing paid work is, on average, more financially valuable for  o c the household.   E d  vi  Productivity in domestic work: Similarly, if women are more capable or productive at housework  o C or childcare – for example, because they did more of it before the crisis and so are more experienced  – the household might benefit more from an extra hour of a mother’s domestic work than it would  from a father’s.    Preferences: The way in which partners share responsibility for childcare and housework could also  be influenced by partners’ preferences, habits or beliefs about who ‘should’ take responsibility for  these activities.   These are, of course, not the only reasons that could affect how mothers and fathers choose to divide  their tasks; other influences, such as different accommodations from employers, could also play a role.  Disentangling all of the different factors at play, and the extent to which each could influence how  couples divide their responsibilities, is a complicated question and outside the scope of this paper. But    16  ONS, ‘Families and the labour market, UK: 2019’,  https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/familiesandt helabourmarketengland/2019 (accessed 21 May 2020).   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS129 in this section, we explore what our descriptives can suggest about the extent to which some of these  causes appear to be at play in driving the gendered division of labour during lockdown.    Are gender gaps explained by mothers being less likely to be employed?     Even prior to the current crisis, mothers were less likely to be in paid work than fathers. On top of that,  in this report we document that the lockdown has caused mothers to stop working for pay at higher rates  than fathers. For efficiency and financial reasons, a spouse who is not working for pay may accumulate  most of the domestic responsibilities within the family. Therefore, one explanation for the gender gaps  we see in childcare and housework is simply that mothers are more likely to be not currently doing paid  work.   If this explanation were sufficient to explain the gender gaps we see, we would expect that mothers who  8 are currently not doing paid work spend their time in the same ways as fathers who are not doing paid  3 1 work. Panel A of Figure 7 shows that this is not the case. It graphs the number of one-hour slots in  - 9 which parents report doing paid work, housework, and childcare (of any type), splitting between those  0 1 who are currently working for pay and those – including furloughed employees – who are not. Panel B  :  0 compares those who report they are working from home and those who report working outside of the  2 0 home.  2 y  l u In Figure 7A, we see large gender gaps even between mothers who are working for pay and fathers who  J 3  are working for pay, and between mothers who are not currently working for pay and fathers who are  2 9,  not currently working for pay. Mothers spend more time than fathers on housework and childcare,  3 regardless of working status. This tells us that the overall gender differences we observe in time spent  s  on domestic activities are not entirely driven by fewer mothers currently doing paid work. Indeed,  c mi mothers who are working for pay spend roughly the same amount of time on these activities as do  o fathers who are not working for pay.   n o c E Fathers’ time use is particularly sensitive to whether or not they are in paid work: fathers who are not  d  i working for pay report spending more than twice as many time slots on housework as those who are,  v o and three more one-hour time slots on childcare. Interestingly, the amount of time that mothers spend  C on childcare is far less responsive to whether or not they work for pay. Indeed, mothers who are not  working for pay do childcare in only one-and-a-half more one-hour time slots than those who are.  Altogether this means that mothers who are working for pay have an especially heavy load. While they  do 2.3 fewer one-hour time slots in paid work than working fathers, they more than compensate for the  difference by putting in an additional 2.7 one-hour time slots of childcare and 1.5 one-hour time slots  of housework compared with fathers in paid work.

In particular, work outside the home is better insulated from domestic  responsibilities during working hours and, after factoring in commuting time, it may also leave fewer  hours available for these activities.17 To shed some light on the extent to which gender differences in  domestic responsibilities among working parents can be explained by the nature of their jobs, we split  time use by whether working parents work from home or outside of the home. Although both mothers  and fathers do more childcare if they are working from home, Figure 7B shows that there are gender  gaps both between mothers and fathers who work from home (with mothers doing childcare during 2.4  more hours than men) and between parents working outside the home (where the gap is even larger, at  3.2 one-hour slots).   Are gender gaps explained by mothers having lower earnings?     Before the pandemic, mothers earned less per hour on average than fathers. There is evidence that they  8 were more willing to sacrifice higher earnings in favour of, for example, more flexible working or a  3 1 shorter commute (Joyce and Norris Keiller 2018; Mas and Pallais 2017). This means that, in strict  - 9 economic terms, families on average benefit financially more from an extra hour of paid work done by  0 1 a man, even if it means his partner has to reduce her paid working hours to pick up more of the  :  0 responsibilities at home. We look now at whether the lower average earnings of mothers relative to  2 0 fathers can explain the overall gender gaps we see.   2 y  l u If this were the main explanation for the overall gender gaps, we would expect to see that parents behave  J 3  symmetrically. That is to say, we would expect that couples usually prioritise the (paid) work of the  2 9,  higher-earning parent, regardless of whether that parent is the mother or the father. This would imply  3 that, on average, higher-earning partners do the same amount of childcare, housework and paid work  cs  whether they are male or female, and lower-earning fathers do the same amount as lower-earning  i m mothers.   o n o Again, this is not what we find. Figure 8 shows how partners who are both currently in paid work are  c E organising their time depending on who earned more before the crisis. It shows clearly that couples  d  i where the father earned more do not organise their time in the opposite way to which couples where the  v o mother earned more do. Indeed, it shows that regardless of who was the higher earner in the couple, the  C father always does more uninterrupted work (2.8 hours if he earned more and 0.6 hours if the mother  earned more). Likewise, even when the mother earned more than her partner, she does 1.6 more hours  of childcare and about the same amount of housework.     17  Commuting to and from paid work is included in our definition of hours spent doing some paid work.

Sample includes only couples where both are currently  9,  working.   3 s  Do gender gaps remain when we remove paid work from the picture?   c mi   o The evidence above suggests that neither employment rates nor relative earnings can fully explain the  n o differences in how mothers and fathers are spending their time in lockdown. This suggests that other  c E considerations drive how parents share responsibilities. One possible factor is parents’ preferences,  d  habits or beliefs about the best way to allocate responsibilities for paid and unpaid work. The dramatic  i v o changes in parents’ work arrangements during the crisis provide a particularly interesting way of  C examining whether this is the case.   We take families where both partners were in paid work before the crisis and look at what happens  when mothers stop working and when fathers stop working. Comparing what happens when the father  versus the mother stops work allows us to see whether there are factors other than economic incentives  at play in how parents divide up responsibilities. If the drivers of the division of responsibilities were  purely economic, we would expect parents to behave symmetrically when either partner stops working:  that when the mother stops working but the father continues, the mother does most of the domestic  work and leaves her partner to focus on paid work, and vice versa.

Time use by who is still working for couples who were both in paid work in February  8 3 1 - 9 0 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,    3 s  But, in practice, we find that the division of responsibilities depending on which parent has stopped  c mi paid work looks very asymmetric. Figure 9 shows the total number of one-hour slots in which mothers  o and fathers do childcare, housework, paid work and uninterrupted paid work for families in which either  n o the mother or the father has stopped working for pay since the lockdown.18 Mothers who stop working  c E take on domestic responsibilities for almost twice as many hours as their partners (over 4 additional  d  one-hour slots of childcare and nearly 3 additional slots of housework). In these families, fathers do  i v o paid work for an average of 7 one-hour slots during the day, with most of this time being uninterrupted  C work time.   But we see quite a different picture in families where fathers stop working. In these families, mothers  and fathers divide domestic responsibilities (for both childcare and housework) roughly equally, despite  the fact that the mother is also working during an average of 5.2 one-hour slots. The result is that  mothers who continue to work for pay do so while also taking on half the domestic responsibilities.   Despite the especially heavy load of mothers who are the only parent working for pay, fathers in these  families do take as large a share of domestic responsibilities as their partners, spending 9.5 hour-long  slots on childcare and 2.7 on housework. Previous research has shown that men who take on more  domestic responsibilities temporarily – for example, doing more of the childcare when offered a more    18  To reduce differences between families where only the father or only the mother works, we restrict the analysis to  families where both parents were working in February.

This suggests that the  temporary changes that the pandemic and the lockdown have forced on families could have longer- lasting impacts on how partners see their roles in the family and organise their work and childcare going  forward.  8 3 1 - 9 0 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v o C COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS135 6.  Conclusion  The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting parents’ working lives across the board. Many parents have lost  their jobs, temporarily or permanently; most are having to contend with vastly increased responsibilities  for education and childcare, as well as housework. At the same time, parents who are still working are  more often than not doing it from home, meaning that family and work responsibilities are now co- existing to a much greater extent than before in the same place and at the same time.   These changes could have substantial effects on gender differences in how couples approach paid work  and family responsibilities. It is well known that, prior to the pandemic, women were less likely than  men to be in paid work; even among workers in similar roles, there is evidence of a persistent gender  gap in hourly wages, with women being paid less, particularly after workers become parents. On the  flip side, women shouldered a greater share of the responsibility for housework and for childcare.  The COVID-19 pandemic affects these inequalities in several ways. We find that – unlike in previous  8 3 recessions – mothers are more likely than fathers to lose their job (temporarily or permanently) during  1 9- the crisis. Among those who are still working for pay, mothers spend less time on paid work throughout  0 1 the day, and more of that working time is split between paid work and other activities, principally  :  childcare. We find that the relative differences between mothers’ and fathers’ work patterns have  0 2 increased since 2014/15 in all three dimensions: being in paid work at all, the hours spent on paid work,  0 2 and the likelihood of being interrupted during work hours.   y  l u 3 J While mothers are still disproportionately responsible for the – much increased – time spent on  2 childcare and housework, there is some evidence that fathers are also dedicating significant amounts of  9,  their time to family responsibilities. This is particularly true for couples where the father has lost his  3 s  job while the mother has kept hers; in these families, fathers are now shouldering slightly more than  c i half of the burden of childcare and housework.   m o n o However, absent the extreme shock of one parent losing his or her job, there is much less evidence that  c E the gender gaps that we document are driven solely by families’ focusing on immediate financial  d  considerations. We find significant gender gaps even between fathers and mothers who are not currently  i v working and, within a couple, the division of labour during the crisis looks strikingly similar whether a  o C mother earned more or less than her partner before the pandemic. While such patterns in the way parents  share responsibilities may have predated the crisis, the vast size of the labour market shocks that many  have faced and the increased need for parents to provide childcare may exacerbate the effects that  unequal sharing have on mothers’ careers.   This research raises at least two crucial questions. First, what will be the impact of the crisis on women’s  experience of the labour market? Will women whose careers have taken a hit during the crisis – whether  because of childcare responsibilities or simply because they work in a more exposed sector – be able to  recover from this in the medium term? Will the effects of the crisis halt or even partly reverse the  progress that has been made in closing the gender wage gap?   The second question is how experiences during the crisis will reshape the attitudes that mothers, fathers  and employers hold towards the division of labour. Recent evidence from paternity leave policies aimed  at increases fathers’ childcare time is mixed. Farré and González (2019), Patnaik (2019), and Tamm  (2019) all show that paternity leave leads a persistent increase in fathers’ involvement in childcare in  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS136 the case of Spain, Canada, and Germany respectively. However, Ekberg et al. (2013) do not find an  effect of “daddy months” in Sweden in father’s likelihood to take medical leave to care for children.  The lockdown as a result of COVID-19 is an even bigger shock to family dynamics than paternity leave  reforms. If this shock has reshaped attitudes towards gender and work, and if these changed attitudes in  turn prompt lasting change in families and workplaces, that could be one silver lining to what has so far  been a very dark cloud.   8 3 1 - 9 0 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v o C COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS137 References  Adams-Prassl, A. 2020. “The Gender Wage Gap on an Online Labour Market : The Cost of  Interruptions.”    Adams-Prassl, A, T Boneva, M Golin, and C Rauh. 2020. “Inequality in the Impact of the Coronavirus  Shock : Evidence from Real Time Surveys.” IZA Discussion Paper, no. 13183.

Copyright: Eric Nævdal COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS140 Introduction.  There is a considerable literature on the economic management of epidemics.  Historically this literature has to a considerable extent been mostly, but not  exclusively, concerned with vaccination. As is to be expected, results will depend  on the biological characteristics of the pathogen at hand. A very important  distinction  is  between  endemic  diseases  and  transient  epidemics.  Endemic  diseases, although subject to episodic spikes, require a different policy perspective  than transient epidemics, see Goldman and Lightwood (2002), Barrett and Hoel  8 (2006)  for  discussions  of  endemic  diseases.  Here  the  focus  is  on  transient  4 1 epidemics such as the common flu and (hopefully) Covid-19. Several articles  - 9 3 analyze the management of transient epidemics by utilizing the well established  1 0:  Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered  (SIR)  model,  developed  by  McKendrick  and  2 0 2 Kermack (1927), see e.g. Morton and Wickwire (1974), Francis (1997) (2004) and  y  l Nævdal (2012). Several papers have examined the effect of policy interventions.  u J 3  E.g  has  Brito  et  al.  (1991)  and  Geoffard  and  Philipson  (1996)  examined  2 9,  vaccination policies. Gersovitz and Hammer (2004) examined the case of several  3 s  instruments. Nævdal (2012) identified the possibility of increasing returns to  c mi scale on pre outbreak vaccination efforts. For some parameter values and stocks  o n of unvaccinated individuals in the population it turned out that the marginal  o Ec value of vaccination is an increasing function of the number of vaccinated, i.e.  d  increasing returns to scale. Nævdal (2012) explained this with a “brush fire”  i v o C effect where a vaccination in a very fast spreading epidemic has little effect unless  followed up with more vaccination. Here I show that the same argument applies  to social distancing as a policy measure.    The analysis is done with a very simple deterministic model in order to highlight  how the epidemic dynamics may imply increasing returns to scale.    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS141 The SIR - model  The model has 3 variables. x is the number of susceptibles, y is the number of  sick and z is the number of individuals who are immune rate. It is assumed that  the population is a constant n so that x + y + z = n. From hereon n is  normalized to 1. The infection rate yis proportional to the product of the number  of infected and the number of susceptibles. An individual can acquire immunity  by recovering from the disease. The equations of motion are given by:      x =-bxy  (1)  8 4   y =bxy-gy  (2)  1 9-   z = gy  (3)  3 1   :  0 2 Here b and g are positive constants. g has the interpretation that g–1 is the  0 2 y  expected  duration  of  the  disease  for  an  infected.  Thus  the  duration  of  the  l u epidemic for an infected individual is exponentially distributed with intensity g. b  J 3  2 is the contact rate and is a product of the transmissibility of the pathogen and  9,  the number of interactions an individual has per day. The basis reproductive  3 s  c number R is given by  i 0 m   R =bg-1   (4)  o 0 n o This is roughly the number that an infected person will infect in the beginning of  c E d  the epidemic. In the basic SIR model, this number together with initial values of  i v state variables will determine the path of the epidemic.   o C   Since x+ y + z = 0 it holds that x(t) + y(t) +z(t) = x(0) + y(0) +z(0) = 1 for  all t. Also, the system has an infinite number of steady states. Any triple (x, y, z)  = (x*, 0, z*) such that x* + z* = 1 is a steady state. There are no steady states  with positive values of y.    The initial conditions are x(0) = 1 – e and y(0) = e. From (2) it is immediately  clear that the epidemic reaches it’s apex, max y(t) when x =  g =R-1.

Note that as long as e is small, it has very little impact on the path. In the  absence of any interventions the number of individuals who will be susceptible  8 4 after an epidemic is given by the value x, denoted x  such that:  1 min - 9   Y(x )=1-x +R-1(ln(x )-ln(1-e))=0   (7)  3 min min 0 min 1 :  We now modify (4) in order to account for social distancing measures.

For t > T we have that h = 0. One way of interpreting h is simply as  9,  3 the reduction in the number of potentially infective social interactions per day,  s  c scaled to be in the same units as R. Thus the definition of social distancing used  mi 0 o here is different than that employed by e.g Gollier (2020) where a fraction of the  n o c population is in lock down.  E d    i v o  It is easy to show that for any R > 1 there is an interval of steady states S =  C 0 éêëxmin,R0-1ùúû that is the set of feasible endpoints for the epidemic. xmin represents a  worst case scenario where the maximum number of individuals, 1 – x , have  min been infected. With interventions, the medically best possible outcome is that the  disease ends with 1 –  R-1 having been infected. If we restrict h to constant  0 functions over we can identify x which is, roughly, the long run number of people  h never infected given a constant value of h until T. Whenever x >  R-1, the  0 epidemic will always reappear when h is set equal to 0. x is determined by a  h modification of (7).

The long run stock of remaining susceptibles, xh, as a function of social distancing  i m   o n o The important thing to note about the relationship between h and x is that x is  c h h E a convex function of h, implying that the higher h, the more effective is a  d  vi marginal increase in h at reducing the number of infected during the course of an  o C epidemic. This is confirmed in Figure 2 where the time paths of x for an epidemic  with R = 2.5 is plotted. The effect of setting h = 0.1 has a negligible effect. x,  0 0 that is x when h = 0, is 0.89. x  = is 0.88, a reduction of 1 percentage point.  h 0.1 However if h is set to 1 and then further increased to 1.1, we have that x  = 0.58  1.5 and x  = 0.51, a reduction of 7 percentage points.  1.1 Herein lie the explanation for increasing returns to scale.

The stock of susceptible individuals over time at different levels of social distancing.  m o   n o c E The economic benefits of social distancing  d  i v o To see how social distancing affects the economic costs of an epidemic we can  C change the model so that R becomes a function of distancing efforts:  0 R =(b-h)g-1 0       (10)  b(h)=gR -h 0 We write b as a function of distancing efforts. Thus the epidemic equations for x  and y may be written:   x =-(gR -h)xy,x(0)=1-e   0    (11)  y =(gR -h)xy-gy. y(0)=e 0 Here h is a measure of social distancing. Then a very simple model of an epidemic  is:  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS145 ¥   V(h)= ò-wye-rtdt   (12)  0 Here wy is the economic surplus lost if y individuals are ill for a unit of time. In  the simulation below w is normalized to one. Let us examine the benefits of social  distancing without examining the costs by doing a thought experiment. Assume  that we fix b so that h > 0 for x ³ x . When x goes below x  we set h = 0. The  crit crit benefit from such an intervention is shown in Figure 3.  8 4 1 - 9 3 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d    i Figure 3. Relationship between the cost of , h. It is clear that the benefits exhibit increasing  v o C returns to scale for h in the interval 0 to 0.3. Thereafter there are diminishing returns that  quickly go to zero. Here x  is set to 0.1.   crit   The specification of the epidemic cost is very simple. In particular they are linear  with respect to the stock of infected. This is unlikely to be the case when an  epidemic is serious with respect to mortality, infectiveness and health outcomes.  If the instantaneous marginal cost of y depends on the magnitude of y, this may,  paradoxically, imply returns to scale become diminishing. This is in line with  Nævdal (2012) who found that more serious epidemics exhibited diminishing  returns to scale on vaccination efforts.  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS146   Summary and policy implications  A transient epidemic is in many ways like a brush fire. A high R has the same  0 effect as a severe drought has on brush land. The drier the vegetation, the more  vegetation is consumed, the quicker is a specific area consumed and the less is the  effect of a bucket of water. This has some implications for economic management.  A very dry area may be a lost cause. However, if it pays to throw one bucket of  water on the fire it pays even more to throw a second bucket. The same goes for  8 epidemics. There may be increasing returns to scale to social distancing and other  4 1 efforts  to  control  the  epidemic.  The  results  have  some  very  clear  policy  - 9 3 implications.   1 0:  1)  With increasing returns to scale, a corner solution, i.e. no distancing, may  2 0 2 be optimal.  y  l 2)  If it pays to apply social distancing as a policy, then it is often the case  u J 3  that if it pays to do a little it pays even more to do a lot.  2 9,  3)  An  issue  not  covered  in  the  present  paper  is  what  happens  when  3 s  individuals respond behaviorally to an epidemic threat by choosing to  c mi socially distance themselves, Garibaldi et al (2020). Does this negate the  o n need for public intervention? In general, the answer is no as the individual  o Ec only receives part of the benefits from their own behavior. Additionally,  d  the analysis here indicates that for some parameter values increasing  i v o C returns to scale implies that individual self distancing may increase the  value of public efforts.    It should also be noted that if alternative measures of social distancing are  employed, this will affect results. The approach to modeling social distancing  employed by Gollier (2020) implies that b becomes a quadratic function of the  fraction of people in lockdown. This would likely strengthen the results in the  present paper.    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS147 The results underscore the need for economic analysis to be founded on a solid  understanding of the mathematical dynamics of an epidemic.

Comparison of the countries  reveals three important lessons for both policies aimed at the pandemic  and broader goals with high uncertainty levels: (1) the precautionary  approach can be lowest cost, while still expensive; (2) detection and  monitoring  (e.g.  testing  and  tracking)  are  integral  to  a  successful  precautionary approach; and (3) expecting tradeoffs between economic  activity and health creates a false dichotomy – they are complements not  substitutes.

Introduction  This paper uses data for the Scandinavian countries to roughly estimate the net expected benefits  of the policies in place across the region to address the novel coronavirus pandemic, and tradeoffs  amongst the different policies in place. With extremely high levels of uncertainty, the policy  differentials are coming to represent potential under-intervention (Sweden), potential over- intervention (Denmark and Norway), and the estimated benefits of increased information and  testing  (Iceland  and  Denmark).  With  similar  cultures  and  institutions  but  differing  current  approaches to the pandemic, the Scandinavian countries provide an opportunity to investigate  how policy differences might be expected to affect the economic and social outcomes from the  5 8 1 virus in the short and longer run.   - 9 4 1 Recall that initial arguments for the shutdown of economic activities focused on ‘flattening the  :  0 2 curve.’ This was intended to alleviate critical anticipated shortages in protective gear (PPE) and  0 2 hospital beds, equipment and staff, and to buy time to remedy a lack of ability to quickly test,  y  ul trace, and isolate. The losses from months of dramatically reduced economic activities have been  J 3  significant and immediate, and not without controversy. The Danish Prime Minister, Mette  2 9,  Frederiksen, has had to defend her government’s “extreme precaution” policy, under which the  3 s  Health Authorities were told to ignore ‘proportionality’ concerns in regulations for the sake of public  c mi health and safety (Ritzau, 2020a), where proportionality refers to the normal way in which Danish  o n regulations must consider the full consequences of government action rather than only health or  o c economy, for example.   E d  i v In contrast, perceived preparedness, in terms of adequate investment in scientific knowledge,  o C facilities, testing and tracking, and gear, may have minimized some economic losses by keeping  social and economic activities more open. This openness has also not been uncontroversial.  Sweden has experienced significantly higher infection and death rates, which they have defended  as a ‘sustainable’ long run investment in overall societal well-being due to the expectation that it  will be a long time before a vaccine or cure can be ready (Ritzau, 2020b). This ‘sustainability’ is  more in line with the Danish business-as-usual (BAU) than proportionality would have been. Thus,  the two countries’ responses represent a precautionary principle approach (Denmark) vs. a BAU  risk management approach that focuses more on the known-unknowns (Sweden) and health  advice rather than behavioral mandates.   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS152 For Iceland, Norway, and Denmark, we calculate estimates for lives saved for the first months of  the pandemic from stricter measures relative to the Swedish experience. We contextualize this  analysis with greater understanding of behavioral changes tracked with Google Mobility data and  of preparedness perceptions with data on hospital capacities. We also track expected economic  losses in GDP for 2020 as forecasted at different points in the pandemic, contextualized with  information on government interventions to understand how expectations and costs have  unfolded as consequences become evident over time. We find evidence that the precautionary  principle approach has had greater payoffs than BAU risk management and suasion alone.  2.  Background and Literature  5 8 At the four-month mark, there has been a turning point in strategies and a measurable divergence  1 - 9 of outcomes that justifies evaluation of these early decisions, despite high remaining levels of  4 1 :  uncertainty. The uncertainties are great for both epidemiological and economic consequences of  0 2 the decisions. Global insurance markets, for example, remain uncertain how to handle the  0 2 changes, with a large outstanding legal question regarding the extent of liability for business  y  l u disruptions in a global pandemic (Chester et al, 2020). Stock markets have crashed and  J 3  recovered, with high volatility remaining. There is some evidence that ESG stocks - those  2 9,  investing according to Environmental, Social and Governance principles - have fared better than  3 s  the broader market (Albuquerque et al, 2020), supporting our understanding that choices aimed  c i m at resilience and precaution that avoid external damages can pay off. The long-term effects of the  o n disease, particularly in younger people, remain unknown while continuing investigations provide  o c E a wide range of concerns, also promoting an interest in avoiding long term downside risks.   d  i v Sweden’s position as a policy outlier due to its refusal to issue lockdown orders has garnered  o C significant research and lay interest. Born, Dietrich and Mueller (2020) and Cho (2020) each  create a counterfactual “Sweden” out of composites of other European countries to analyze the  effects of the non-pharmaceutical interventions available to Sweden but unused; they find  opposing results. Born et al (2020), published with data for only the first month of the crisis,  suggest that lockdowns would not have given Sweden any significant additional benefit. Soo  (2020), with later data available, finds the opposite. Sweden’s government and epidemiological  team have argued from the start that there is a need for long term strategy (Prime Minister’s  Office, 2020), and assessments moving forward may indeed reflect a back-and-forth in measures  of success over the next year or longer in the search for a vaccine or cure. However, the significant  re-openings  of  Denmark,  Iceland  and  Norway  suggest  that  there  have  been  important  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS153 opportunities to reduce the impacts which Sweden lost in the early days of the pandemic. Sweden  itself has determined, as of July 8th, that some policy revision may be needed (Ministry of Health  and Social Affairs, 2020a) and has also launched an investigation into the early handling of the  pandemic (Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, 2020b), though the investigation’s results are not  expected until the end of February 2022.   The pandemic seems to have eased significantly, at least temporarily, in Denmark, Norway and  Iceland. A slow restarting of economic activities begun mid-April has been gaining momentum.  This has occurred so far without significant increases in cases or deaths; combined COVID-19  deaths by June 30, 2020 for the three countries number 865 (Table 1) and new cases per 100,000  5 residents per week are now below 5 in all three countries (Table 1). On June 15th these three  8 1 countries plus Germany began allowing mostly unrestricted travel again, and further unrestricted  - 9 4 EU travel became possible July 1st. Sweden, on the other hand, with whom full open borders will  1 :  not recommence for the time being, has had the highest national rate of new cases per capita  0 2 0 amongst Northern, Southern and Western European countries since week 22 (May 24-30).   2 y  l u Table 1: COVID-19 Disease statistics for Scandinavian Countries through July 1, 2020.

Effects of intervention on epidemiological outcomes for COVID-19  Epidemiological-economic modeling for COVID-19 is proceeding rapidly. Most of these models  currently rely on a parameterized S(E)IR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered/Removed)  model in a dynamic optimization framework (Eichenbaum et al, 2020; Flaxman et al, 2020;  Thunstrom et al, 2020; Greenstone and Nigam, 2020). The models have varying degrees of detail  for both economic and demographic-epidemiological parameters, but few have so far included  human behavioral responses directly in the assessments of economic costs and benefits. Moving  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS154 forward, more emphasis is likely to be placed on such behavioral responses as we come to better  understand  the  impacts  of  decentralized  decision-making  under  social-distancing  (Cornell  Atkinson Center for Sustainability, 2020) and the role of super-spreaders (e.g. Sneppen &  Simonsen, 2020). For our purposes, we use Google Mobility Data to explore behavioral changes.  Furthermore, high levels of trust in Scandinavia (Andersen, 2017) may minimize any distortions  of modeling without formal accounting for behavioral responses, which we must do to include  Iceland. This is because most citizens readily follow the advice of government and medical  professionals; this assumption is confirmed for the pandemic with the Google Mobility Data (see  section 3.4).   5 We have examined in close detail the Imperial College London epidemiological method described  8 1 in Flaxman et al, (2020) and find that even the state-of-the-art epidemiological modeling is fraught  - 9 4 with overly simplified assumptions of both the transmission of the disease and the efficacy of  1 :  policy. These simplifications generate great uncertainty in the unchecked potential of this  0 2 0 pandemic and have lent themselves to generating large estimates of the magnitudes of savings.  2 y  We have run their shared program code with updated country-specific data and the addition of  l u J Iceland  through  June  3rd,  2020  to  discover  that  their  model,  while  replicable,  produces  3  2 unreasonable results when just a few weeks are added to the analysis and also does a poor job  9,  3 of explaining Iceland’s pandemic experience. In short, with their model, without lockdown  s  c interventions, more Europeans would have COVID-19 by this time than exist.1 Their estimates  i m that suggest there were millions of lives saved in 11 European countries by early May, generated  o n o by the assumption that the disease would have spread unchecked at high reproduction rates (~3.8  c E for the Scandinavian countries) are not convincing for the longer term. Our model uses the  d  vi Swedish case as the counterfactual, thus avoiding the need to make heroic assumptions about  o C deaths avoided as the pandemic has unfolded.   2.2. Effects of intervention on economic outcomes for COVID-19  Like Flaxman et al (2020), economists’ research on the net benefits of social distancing has  produced large estimates of benefits. Thunstrom et al. (2020) and Greenstone and Nigam (2020)  both found that in the US case, social distancing measures should save the US economy over $5  trillion in losses, mainly due to avoided loss of life from ‘flattening the curve’ and overwhelming  scarce medical resources. Eichenbaum et al (2020) dive further into the US economy with a more    1 We are not alone in noticing the significant limitations of this model, as the comments on the Nature  website pertaining to it attest.   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS155 thoroughly defined SIR-model coupled to a macroeconomic model with both aggregate demand  and supply effects. They also found ‘doing nothing’ to induce social distancing should result in  tens of trillions of dollars in net losses to the US.  These papers, released at the beginning of the pandemic in the US, in March 2020, focus mainly  on the statistical value of saved lives (VSL). Their mean estimates of economic damages are now  lower than current estimates of the magnitude or duration of the economic consequences for the  U.S., where about 40 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the last 2.5 months.2  Recent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) place the expected reduction of  GDP in the US in double digits for 2020, and requiring a decade to recover to 2019 levels (CBO,  5 2020). Furthermore, as US workers often receive health care benefits through their place of  8 1 employment, additional health risks may be accruing from the unemployment, compounding the  - 9 4 problem. Government schemes to support workers have been both unprecedented in magnitude  1 :  and insufficient to cover the losses Americans face (Parrott et al, 2020). At the same time, over  0 2 0 140,000 persons have died from the coronavirus in the US, providing a rough estimate of 1.3  2 y  trillion  US  dollars  in  losses  at  a  current  VSL  of  $9.3  million  (Eichenbaum  et  al,  2020).  l u J Epidemiologists have now estimated that these US figures could have been 40% lower if social  3  2 distancing mandates had taken effect one week earlier in March (Pei et al, 2020). With numbers  9,  3 of US cases rising dramatically again, the call for new social distancing requirements and  s  c lockdowns is growing, including from the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious  i m Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci (Linebaugh and Knutson, 2020). The significant economic costs that  o n o have already been paid will have been almost complete losses if greater control is not established  c E over the pandemic. This is an important lesson that the Scandinavian experience highlights in  d  vi cross-section rather than time series. Swedish economic gains appear to be virtually non-existent  o C compared to the other Scandinavian countries; there has been little if any positive tradeoff in  purely economic gains.   Furthermore, since labor and health markets in Scandinavia operate differently from the US, with  e.g. national health care and flexicurity (Barth et al, 2014), and government interventions have  funded schemes to keep workers employed, the overall economic consequences in the region  have been borne more broadly by government spending and borrowing than by individuals; this  may defer more costs to future years but has maintained considerable economic continuity in  spite  of  social  distancing-imposed  closures  and  restrictions.  Neither  the  economic  nor    2 This likely does not include significant numbers of e.g. informal workers in tourism who are not eligible for  unemployment.   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS156 epidemiological outcomes in Scandinavia have been as dire as in the US. These are broader  lessons to preparedness and resilience.   Economic forecasts have varied within and across locations, reflecting unprecedented uncertainty  about the local and global effects of COVID-19 interventions. The breadth of estimates, also in  comparison to the beginning of the year and in the weeks following the WHO’s first public  notification of the COVID-19 disease spreading in Wuhan Province, China, on January 12th, is  shown in Figure 1 (See Appendix 1 for summary and sources). In January 2020, all four countries  were expecting modest growth between 1-2%, with consensus across a variety of sources. Since  new estimates started to surface from mid-March, all countries are predicting declines in GDP for  5 the year, but there remains little certainty about the magnitude of those declines. Between the  8 1 BAU forecasts at the beginning of the year and the spring estimates, all countries experienced  - 9 4 their first COVID-19 cases (dash-dotted lines), and all had issued varying degrees of restrictions  1 :  on movement and recommendations for social distancing.   0 2 0 2 Table 2: Restrictions and Social Distancing Policies  y  l u J    Denmark  Iceland  Norway  Sweden  3  2 Border Closures  3/13 -6/27*  3/16-6/15*  3/12-8/20*  3/18-6/15**  9,  Testing for visitors  Yes  Yes  No   No  3 Mobile Contact Tracing App Start  6/18  4/1  4/18***  4/29  s  c Event Prohibitions  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  i m Max. number (most restrictive)  10  10  5  50  o n Max. number (July 10)  50  500  50  50  o c Start Date  3/13  3/16  3/12  4/29  E d  School Closures              vi Primary (gr K-5)  3/11-4/15  3/16 - 5/4**  3/12 - 4/27  none  o C Middle (gr 6-10)  3/11- 5/18  3-16 - 5/4**  3/12 - 5/11  none  Gymnasium (gr 11-13)  3/11-6/8  3/16 - 5/4*   3/12 - 5/11  3/17-6/15**  Universities  3/11-6/22*  3/16 - 5/4*  3/12 - 6/15  3/17-6/15**  Business restrictions:          Health and Personal Care  3/13-4/15  3/16 - 5/4*  3/12-4/27*  independent   Retailers  3/13 - 5/11**  3/16 - 5/25*,**  3/12-4/27*,**  independent   Restaurants  3/13-5/18**  3/16-5/25*,**  3/12-5/11**  independent^  Cultural activities  3/13-5/27  3/16 - 5/4  3/12-6/15  independent   *partial lifting          **partial openings throughout      *** App use banned June 15 citing privacy concerns    ^ distancing regulations and liabilities changed in SE July 1, increasing requirements    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS157 The timeline in Figure 1 and dates summarized in Table 2 mark the periods during which the  major restrictions and behavioral advice were announced and implemented by each country as  the period between solid lines for each country (Denmark in red, Norway in gray, Iceland in blue,  and Sweden in yellow). As is well known, Sweden has had the least direct economic interventions.  The country also took the greatest amount of time to issue recommendations and to implement  the  few  restrictions  on  some  gathering  sizes  and  some  school  closures,  with  first  recommendations as early as March 11th and the closure of gymnasiums (high schools) on March  27th. Denmark announced dramatic restrictions, also on March 11th, but these would come into  effect by March 13th, including travel restrictions to and from other countries. Norway’s restrictions  were announced a day later, with immediate effect, though there were a few additional days  5 before the travel restrictions commenced. Iceland, which had a jump on testing that began at the  8 1 - end of January, took longer than Denmark or Norway to implement fewer overall restrictions.  9 4 1 Denmark and Norway used the lockdown period to increase testing capacities. While gradual  :  0 openings started before the full effect of increased testing capabilities came online in early May,  2 0 2 most testing and tracking implementations were in place before students older than about 11  y  l returned to schools, and adults to work, from mid-May.  u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v o C COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS158 Annual GDP Growth Estimates, Scandinavian Economies st Timeline for First Cases, Testing, Restrictions and Easing a 2 c e r o F 0 )  % h ( -2 wt o r -4 G P NO Avg DDSKE  -AA6vvgg G al  5 Re IS- A8vg 8 1 0  - 2 9 0-10 4 2 0: 1 nual -12 WHO issues 1st warning 2 n 0 A 2 Jan1 Feb1 Mar1 Apr1 May1 Jun1 Jul1 y  l u Denmark Iceland Norway Sweden J 3  2 Vertical lines: JRaensutraicryti o1n2sth/s:o WciHalO d iisstsaunecsin fgir simt gplloebmael nwtaerdn: inbge.t w1eset nin -scooliudn ltirnye csa. sEeass:i ndga:s dho-dttoetd. lines.

Model and Data  3.1. Model  We first model how many cases a country will have at a given time, as a function of their current  caseload and the non-pharmaceutical interventions and behavior. We do this using a logistic  growth SEIR approach, so that:  New cases = fn (total cases, country specific non-pharmaceutical interventions,  carrying capacity, behavioral responses)  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS159 We then model the probability that these cases translate to deaths per 1000 people for each  country. The mortality rates may differ due to formal interventions promoting social distancing,  knowledge of illness (testing), and by fixed effects including hospital capacities, so that:  New deaths per 1000 people = fn(previous case rates, previous testing rates, country  specific  non-pharmaceutical  interventions  and  hospital  capacities,  behavioral  responses)  We use these models and panel data from March through early July 2020 pertaining to cases,  deaths, testing and hospital capacities, mobility patterns and country-specific non-pharmaceutical  interventions to estimate expected cases and deaths for each country. With these sets of  5 8 estimates, we cast conditions in Denmark, Norway and Iceland to Swedish conditions to estimate  1 - 9 how many cases and deaths have been avoided through stricter social distancing requirements.  4 1 :  0 3.2. Pandemic Preparedness  2 0 2 y  In 2019, for the first time a Global Health Security Index ranked countries for their pandemic  l u J preparedness (GHX Index, 2019). The index considers 34 indicators aimed at comparing  3  2 prevention, detection, response, health, norms and risk preparedness for pandemics. Table 3  9,  shows how the four Scandinavian countries ranked, as well as their scores.   3 s  c mi Table 3: Pandemic preparedness figures  o n o   Denmark  Iceland  Norway  Sweden  c E d  GHS Index Score (out of 100)  70.4  46.3  64.6  72.1  i v o GHS ranking (out of 195 countries)  8  58  16  7  C Hospital beds per thousand people  2.5  2.91  3.6  2.22    The index correctly assessed that no country was particularly well prepared for a pandemic. It  also suggests Sweden and Denmark were viewed as relatively more prepared for the pandemic  than most other countries, including Iceland and Norway. The breadth of the preparedness index  did not enter the political debate regarding whether to shut down or not, however; this focused  almost entirely on the number of ICUs and respirators.   The overall Swedish and Danish preparedness indicated by the index is not well-reflected in  hospital beds per 1000 people (Table 3). Sweden had the lowest number, at 2.22 per 1000 people,  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS160 while Norway had the most, at 3.6 per 1000 people. As mentioned, the focus of most social  distancing policies was to flatten the curve in order to not exceed the capacity of the health care  system. One of the most critical aspects is the availability of intensive care units (ICUs). Figure 2  shows the total capacity of directly available ICUs as estimated by the different authorities in  Denmark, Norway and Sweden, as well as the number of people occupying these units.3 Sweden  has had a larger number of people in intensive care (IC), and actually has exceeded their direct  capacity, whereas Denmark and Norway have not come close to capacity.  5 8 1 - 9 4 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v   o C Figure 2: Number of people in intensive care (IC) and in respiration. For Norway and Sweden  respectively the number of people in IC and in respiration were not directly available; they have  been estimated based on the mean percentage difference in Denmark. Supporting data in  Appendix 2.  Sources: Danish IC and respiration: Statistikbanken, capacity: Sundhedsstyrelsen,  Norwegian data: Helsedirektorat, Swedish IC data: Svenska Intensivvårdsregistret, Swedish  capacity: Sjödin et al., 2020.  Given that these are absolute numbers it is not surprising that Sweden has a larger number of  people in IC than Denmark and Norway, as Sweden’s population is roughly twice as large as that  of Denmark or Norway. However, the absolute IC peak in Sweden is 3.6 times the number in  Denmark, so even after accounting for differences in population the number of people in IC is    3 Figures for Iceland could not be located, but capacity has not been exceeded.  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS161 significantly higher. Also, the duration of the peak seems to be longer in Sweden. Despite the  continuing climb in deaths in Sweden, IC and ventilator use have declined into July.  3.3. Policy Interventions  In this section, we compile the economic and non-pharmaceutical measures taken in the four  countries as recorded by the IMF (IMF, 2020a). These show that all four countries have taken  extensive monetary and fiscal policy measures (Tables 4 and 5 and Figure 5) to counter the  economic effects of the virus, and again that Sweden has not had reduced costs in this dimension.  3.3.1.

COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS162   3.3.1.1.  Closures (Lockdowns)  Sweden kept borders and schools more open, as visible in Figure 3. Given that we have learned  that children do not exhibit illnesses as frequently or as intensely from COVID-19 infection (Lee  et al, 2020) and may not transmit the virus as easily, or at least are no more likely as adults to  transmit it (Rajmil, 2020), and there were no significant spikes after primary schools reopened, it  is possible that by not closing primary schools, the main impact has been that parents did not stay  home with them. The school closures may well have enforced adult distancing more than directly  influenced the reduction in spread through their actions.  5 8   1 - 3.3.1.2.  Testing  9 4 1 :  The testing strategies of the countries provide the detection and monitoring necessary to complete  0 2 management of the pandemic at low levels of spread and to maintain the benefits of the  0 2 y  precautionary approach. They have been quite different from one another (Figure 4). Iceland was  l u quick to scale up testing, and the country was able to use a broad testing strategy to effectively  J 3  2 identify and isolate cases quickly; deaths on the island nation have been limited to 10. Additionally,  9,  the information from Icelandic testing has informed the world about the high levels of asymptotic  3 s  carriers and the spread of the disease (Gudbjartsson et al, 2020), creating significant positive  c i m externalities for the world’s battle against the virus. In Denmark, Novo Nordisk has contributed  o n financial and technical support worth tens of millions of dollars to increase testing (Novo Nordisk  o c E Fonden, 2020). This investment has significantly increased testing capacities in the country;  d  i testing has gone from requiring significant symptoms and a doctor’s approval to access for  v o C anyone to schedule an appointment for themselves, including at mobile sites in vacation  communities. Both Iceland and Denmark are now offering testing for arrivals at airports. While  Norway has not increased the rate of testing to the extent Denmark has, they have increased  testing and access to testing over time as well. The Swedes are not yet testing at levels that catch  significant numbers of asymptotic or mild cases, which is reducing the ability to contain and track  the disease.

Fiscal Policy Interventions  9 4 1 :  Table 4 and Figure 5 summarize fiscal policy intervention efforts. All Scandinavian governments  0 2 0 have implemented significant fiscal stimulus and support, totaling around 10% of the countries’  2 y  2019 GDPs. All four countries have made some form of security for wages, through which they  l u J support employers who keep workers on the payroll even when they must stay home or there is  3  2 no work for them. Gaps in the programs have resulted in increased unemployment, but the  9,  3 increases in unemployment are significantly lower than in other countries. IMF estimates for 2020  s  c unemployment, alongside 2019 values, are also shown in Figure 5; estimated unemployment  i m impacts are significant despite these interventions, with Denmark and Sweden expecting to  o n o perform better than Iceland and Norway in this dimension.   c E d  Table 4: Fiscal Interventions to Counter Economic Losses from the COVID-19 Pandemic  i v o Fiscal Intervention  Denmark  Iceland  Norway  Sweden  C Discretionary spending  131.4b    (DKK)  2.04 b     (USD)  162.1b    (NOK)  544b - 832b*  (currency)  (SEK)  Discretionary spending  5.70%  10%  5.50%  10.8-16.6%*  (%2019 GDP)  Automatic stabilizers, expected  5.10%  unk.  2.83%    (%2019 GDP)  Wage securities** (partial)  Yes, ~75%  Yes, ~75%  Yes, ~80%  Yes, ~75%  Reduced VAT  No  No  Yes  Deferred payment  *discretionary and automatic not separated  ** Arrangements differ between countries and wage structures    COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS164 Estimated Fiscal support (% 2019 GDP) and  Estimated Unemployment in 2020 (%) 16 14 12 13.7 13 10 10.8 8 10 10.064 6 8 8.33 6.5 6.8 4 5 2 3.6 3.7 0 5 8 Denmark Iceland Norway Sweden 1 -   9 Fiscal support 2020 Unemployment 2019 Unemployment 4 1 Figure 5: Estimated Fiscal Policy Support as percentage of 2019 GDP and Estimated 2020  0:  Unemployment (IMF World Economic Outlook estimates, April 2020).    2 0 2   y  l u 3.3.3.

Behavioral Responses  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS165 In considering Sweden as our baseline, it is important to identify what social distancing without  government mandated lockdowns looks like in terms of behavior, versus a more complete  lockdown.

COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS166 In an effort to understand the human dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and response, Google  has collated information from web browser use on the daily percent changes from baseline in  daily visits to six types of places where visitor patterns are thought to have been impacted from  COVID-19 and our responses. From Feb. 15, 2020 on, the company has used location data from  web browsers to show how visits to retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit  stations, workplaces and residential locations have changed relative to an initial baseline. The  baseline is “the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period  Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020” (Google LLC, 2020). The data may have selection issues relating to, among  other things, seasonal changes and/or which users allow their location data to be tracked, so the  results should be taken as indicative rather than definitive. There is no data available for Iceland.   5 8 1 One can see in Figure 6 that while the patterns for Scandinavians are very similar, the Swedes  - 9 4 behaved differently from the Danes and Norwegians during the more stringent Danish and  1 :  Norwegian restrictions, and less so before and after these periods. Swedes are changing their  0 2 0 behaviors to reduce risks, but these changes are less intense than for Norway and Denmark;  2 y  relatively, they are staying home less (residential locations), they are going to work more  l u J (workplace locations), and they have not reduced their use of public transport nearly to the same  3  2 extent (transit stations). As the restrictions in Norway and Denmark ease, behaviors have  9,  3 converged again, supporting our assessment that now is a good point in time to analyze the  s  c different policies.  i m o n 4.  Results  o c E 4.1. Predicting New Cases  d  i v We use a random effects model for the panel composed of the 4 Scandinavian countries and a  o C timeline from the early cases at the end of February to the beginning of July to predict new cases  with two model specifications. Specification (I) relies on the bio-economic structure of a density- dependent (logistic) growth function with non-pharmaceutical interventions that slow the growth  rate  (spread)  of  the  virus  while  specification  (II)  adds  behavioral  information  on  where  Scandinavians have spent their time. Specification II comes at the expense of the Icelandic case,  for which there is no Google Mobility data. Results for Specifications (I) and (II) are visualized in  Figure 7, while parameters and diagnostics are in Appendix 3. Both specifications have high  econometric fit. The visualization in Figure 7 makes clear that the addition of the mobility data is  valuable, particularly in the continuing evolution of the Swedish experience. The peaks of new  cases in Denmark, Norway, and Iceland are smoothed. This is likely due to the lack of spatial  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS167 differentiation; a model that separated urban and rural cases, for example, should better predict  the peaks.   From the regression results, we are also able to calculate a base reproduction rate (R0) estimate  of between 2.9 and 3.0. This is in line with lower- to mid- rates used or found in most models to  date, which Alimohamadi et al. (2020) estimate through meta-analysis to have a mean of 3.32  (2.81-3.82).   Actual vs. Predicted New Cases, COVID-19 Denmark Iceland 5 400 100 8 -1 300 80 9 60 4 200 1 40 0:  100 20 2 0 0 0 2 y  Mar1 Apr1 May1 Jun1 Jul1 Mar1 Apr1 May1 Jun1 Jul1 ul Actual Model I Model II Actual Model I J 3  2 9,  Norway Sweden 3 3000 s  400 c mi 300 2000 o 200 n 1000 o 100 c E 0 0 d  i Mar1 Apr1 May1 Jun1 Jul1 Mar1 Apr1 May1 Jun1 Jul1 v o Actual Model I Model II Actual Model I Model II C Figure 7: Actual vs. Predicted New Cases of COVID-19 in 4 Scandinavian countries over time,  Feb. 26-Jul 5, 2020.  Both specifications include the closure of Middle Schools (ages 10-16, grades 6-10) lagged by  two weeks for the intended effects to show. This measure is used as the most indicative of the  impacts of highly collinear lockdown activities in the three countries (evidenced in Figure 1 and  Table 2); by the time these students go back to school in May, the Google Mobility differences  between the countries with closures and Sweden have shrunk back significantly (Figure 6). While  the coefficients are negative, they are not significant. This may be due to collinearity problems  with interacted timeline terms, which reflect how the virus’s rate of growth has slowed much more  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS168 in Denmark, Norway, and Iceland over time. It may, however, reflect the importance of behavior  relative to mandate.   Density dependence is not yet a significant factor; this is expected as the infection rates remain  very low compared to the overall population. Again, a more spatially granulated model, or one  further into the future, might find that the virus is running out of space to spread in some  communities.    4.2. Predicting Deaths from Cases  Countries may also differ in their ability to prevent cases from becoming deaths. We again  5 construct two specifications with AR-1 processes for predicting new deaths per 1000 people using  8 1 - our panel data4, with similar reasoning to the above. Specification (Id) includes Iceland and uses  9 4 1 only lagged cases per 1000 people, tests per 1000 people, school closing and hospital capacities  :  0 (fixed effect) to predict new deaths, while specification (IId) excludes Iceland but includes  2 0 2 behavioral information from Google Mobility data. Again, both specifications have good fits. The  y  l regression results are in Appendix 4.  u J 3  2 In all specifications, the lagged total case rates are unsurprisingly significant factors. Furthermore,  9,  higher testing rates (lagged) indicate significantly lower death rates. This suggests that people  3 cs  are able and willing to act on the information contained in testing in ways that reduce deaths.  i m Indeed, Iceland’s early and aggressive testing and Denmark’s dramatic increases in testing (recall  o n o Figure  4)  are  quite  different  policies  from  Sweden’s  poor  testing  performance.  Testing  c E aggressively, a parallel to monitoring and early detection of environmental and health problems  d  vi more broadly, should be recognized as a vital component of the precautionary principle.   o C Additionally,  in  both  cases,  lagged  middle  school  closures  do  have  significant  negative  coefficients. This suggests that closing schools and/or correlated mandates to stay home have  helped keep increasing cases from translating to increasing deaths, even if they did not  significantly contribute to reducing cases. There may be many reasons for this, which this analysis  cannot fully address, but may include significantly reduced activity outside the home by all family  members if children are at home. This is aided by the supportive Scandinavian approach to work- life balance, which for example even in non-coronavirus times, facilitates parents’ ability to stay  home for the first days of a child’s illness, and provides other short and long term leaves for illness    4 AR processes are anticipated in the time series due to the progressive nature of the virus, and AR-1 is confirmed by  a Wooldridge test for serial correlation using xtserial following Wooldridge (2002) and Drukker (2003).

As shown in the previous section, Sweden has exceeded its hospital capacities, while the other  countries have not come close. Higher hospital capacities, which in this case are ordered fixed  effects (recall Table 3), do coincide with lower rates of conversion from cases to deaths in both  specifications; this undoubtedly reflects not only relative hospital capacities but other fixed effects  between the countries.   Unlike the estimation of new cases, behavioral information adds little in terms of significant results.  This is not surprising given the lack of knowledge about how to treat the virus, so that it must  5 8 generally run its natural course once contracted.   1 - 9 4 1 4.3.

The models somewhat overestimate deaths in Denmark and  Iceland but underestimate them in Norway and Sweden.   4.4. Estimated Damages  4.4.1.  Estimated Value of Statistical Lives Saved (VSL)  We have two sets of estimates of value of statistical lives that parameterize the expected gains  from social distancing and lockdown.

Range of Estimated Losses  i v o C We calculate a range of estimated losses in billions of 2019 USD. For the low end, we assume  that government expenditures are covered with future growth and do not include them. We also  use the lower value estimates for VSL and the lowest estimates for GDP losses. The mean  estimates also ignore government expenditures, but they include the higher VSL figures and the  mean estimates for GDP losses. For the high end, we include government expenditures as well  as use the higher VSL figures and the worst-case GDP loss scenarios. Figure 10 shows that  Iceland faces the lowest expected total losses. At the mean, this translates to $5,781 per capita  (Table 7). This is higher than the Danish and Norwegian per capita losses, which are $4,124 and  $4,541 respectively. Sweden outpaces all three countries with a mean per capita loss estimate of  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS171 $8,300. At the top end, the per capita figures are $12,524 (NO), $13,559 (DK), $15,279 (IS), and  $17,004 (SE). Supporting calculations for estimates of lives saved are in Appendix 5.

We find that the Danish savings relative to a Swedish approach range from 4.149  billion USD to 12.098 billion USD, Icelandic savings relative to a Swedish approach are estimated  at 1.625 billion USD, and Norwegian savings range from 9.082 billion USD to 33.722 billion USD.  The per capita values are shown in Table 8, alongside the breakdowns of these ranges.   COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS172 Estimated per capita savings from the precautionary approach in lives saved are of approximately  the same magnitude as or larger than the damages incurred in these countries.

Discussion   3  2 5.1. Issues of Incidence and Insurance  9,  3 s  In considering the net costs and damages of the pandemic, we have not considered incidence in  c mi any detail. Government support in all four countries has postponed and distributed costs of  o n unemployment, and long run impacts are difficult to assess at this time.   o c E d  For businesses, the burden of incidence remains unclear, and depends on how insurance claims  i v and legal controversies are resolved. As insurance is a key tool for risk management, it is useful  o C to understand how the pandemic is affecting the industry in Scandinavia. Overall, the influence in  the insurance sector is diverse and depends on the carrier's exposure in various insurance lines.  The lines of insurance that are suffering the most significant losses in Scandinavia so far seem to  be those that are negatively influenced by the forced stop in activities, e.g., travel insurance, event  cancellation insurance, etc. On the other hand, some have been positively influenced by a stop.  Most clearly this is being seen in private property claims and motor claims. Burglaries have been  declining in private homes, and other claims are also expected to decrease as well, as homes  have been watched over 24/7. Motor claims have significantly decreased as a consequence of  people traveling less.  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS173 As the crisis was not perceived by most individual decision-makers to be a likely threat before it  occurred, many insurance policies have failed to include appropriate coverage for the actual  impacts. Where it has been included in the apparent scope of coverage, several currently  contested  legal  factors  affect  eligibility  for  insurance  compensation.  For  example,  the  government’s instructions are seen to affect the eligibility for compensation. Lack of precision in  the lockdown strategy can cause clients to fail to qualify for compensation, which has been an  effect of the more open instructions in Sweden.  The rapid change in the risk landscape has made it difficult to foresee the short- and long-term  economic effects in the insurance market. Future data will provide a better understanding of how  5 different lockdown strategies have affected the insurance market and how the market will mitigate  8 1 future pandemic crises in the world and/or distribute the costs across those affected.  - 9 4 1 :  The virus itself has to date overwhelmingly affected elderly individuals in the Scandinavian  0 2 countries, particularly elderly individuals in elder care homes. In addition to the interest in weighing  0 2 the meaning of this uneven distribution, this suggests that an age-structured SEIR model may be  y  l u appropriate for future work. Sweden, in one of its few strict restrictions finally banned most visits  J 3  to elder care facilities, has admitted that it should have done more, earlier, to reduce contact  2 9,  between elderly populations and others (The Local, 2020) and would likely have reduced deaths  3 s  in so doing.   c i m o 5.2. Substitution and Income effects  n o c E Much has been made of the improvements in air quality from reduced travel during the pandemic,  d  vi with e.g. claims of up to 30% reductions in pollution in some locations with the strictest lockdowns  o C (Muhammad et al, 2020). To the extent these gains are real, they are not expected to last, unless  the break in activity produces other substitutions. A cursory examination of the data for major  Scandinavian  cities  (Appendix  6)  suggests  possibilities  worthy  of  further  investigation.  In  particular, while nitrous oxides, the main regional pollutants from transportation vehicles, are  lower during the main ‘lockdown’ months of March and April 2020 vs. 2019, for Denmark, Norway  and Sweden, they are also lower for other months versus 2019 as well. Scandinavian countries,  particularly Norway, have already invested significantly in urban air quality as they have become  some of the richest countries in the world. Oil prices have declined, reducing Norwegian wealth  and increasing the opportunity costs of transitioning to more fuel-efficient transport. If, as can be  expected, these effects and the broader economic losses of the pandemic divert efforts from both  COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS174 private and public long-term plans to improve environmental quality, this will add to the overall  losses generated by the pandemic.   6.  Conclusions  For Denmark, Iceland, and Norway, precautionary principle approaches that include successful  testing and tracing strategies have paid off to date. They have saved lives estimated to be worth  up to 47.4 billion USD, with no measurable tradeoff in economic consequences compared to  Sweden. We use a bio-economic model of growth in the disease and augment it with behavioral  information from Google Mobility data. The model predicts cases and deaths from COVID-19 well  and confirms R0’s for Scandinavian countries of ~3, as found by others. Both government  5 8 mandates and individual changes in behaviors reduce the reproduction rate over time; countries  1 - 9 with more strict mandates have seen fewer deaths than those without.   4 1 :  0 The comparison of the Scandinavian countries’ early experience with the novel coronavirus in the  2 0 2 first half of 2020 provides an opportunity to evaluate precautionary approaches to BAU risk  y  l management. The results emphasize that the idea of a clean tradeoff between economic and  u J 3  health outcomes is a false dichotomy. The problem is rather a joint cost and damage minimizing  2 9,  exercise, with inseparable interactions.  3 cs  Data Sources  i m o Danmarks Nationalbank (2020c).

The rate of compliance to these  measures has varied substantially. We study how cultural differences can  explain this variance using data on mobility in Swiss cantons between  6 1 2 January and May 2020. We find that mobility declined after the outbreak  - 6 but significantly less in the German-speaking region. Contrary to the  8 1 evidence in the literature, we find that within the Swiss context, higher  :  0 2 generalized trust in others is strongly associated with lower reductions in  0 2 individual mobility. Additionally, support for a limited role of the state in  y  l matters of welfare is also found to be negatively associated with mobility  u 3 J reduction. We attribute our results to a combination of these cultural  2 traits having altered the trade-off between the chance of contracting  9,  3 the virus and the costs associated with significant alterations of daily  cs  activities. i m o n o c E d  i v o C 1  The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva. 2  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Geneva.

Flatteningthecontagioncurvehasrapidlybe- comea priorityinmany countriesinanattempt toreducetheload onthehealthcaresystemand the overall mortality rate. A two-months strict lockdown was introduced in the Chinese province ofHubeionJanuary23,andWesterndemocraciesfollowedsuitenactingshelter-inplaceandsocial distancing measures and large cut backs on production activities. Many countries have also tried to reduce interpersonal contact and mobility through massive “stay at home” media campaigns 6 aimed at altering citizens habits. While the health measures enacted have been, by and large, 1 2 - homogeneous across countries, compliance to these rules varied widely with the local context. In 6 8 1 theabsenceofperfectenforcementcapacitybythestates,culturalattitudesandbehavioralnorms, :  0 2 which typically vary from country to country, can make an important diﬀerence and explain de- 0 2 y  viations in voluntary compliance. This is all the more true when it comes to individual mobility l u J decisions, which entails a delicate trade-oﬀ between the chance of contracting (or diﬀusing) a dis- 3  2 easeandtheeconomic(andindividualwellbeing)costsassociatedtosigniﬁcantalterationsofdaily 9,  3 activities. s  c i m There are major cultural diﬀerences, for example, in the physical distance that people keep when o n o interacting with others, with Southern Europeans preferring closer interpersonal distance than c E d  Northern Europeans and Northern Americans (Remland et al. (1995); Sorokowska et al. (2017)). i v o Since social contact patterns are a crucial factor behind the spread of the disease, the beneﬁt of C abidingtostrictsocialdistancingrulesandreducingmobilitywillbehigherinsocietiesaccustomed to close interactions (Prem et al. (2017); Oksanen et al. (2020)). Can there be a role for cultural biasesinthespreadofpandemics? Westudyhowculturalvaluesmayplayaroleintheevolutionof individualmobilityunderCOVID-19measures. Ourworkcontributestoagrowingbodyofstudies linking cultural variables, social distancing, and the spread of COVID-19 (Durante et al. (2020); Barrios et al. (2020); Borgonovi and Andrieu (2020); Brodeur et al. (2020); Egorov et al. (2020); Bargain and Aminjonov (2020)).

R¨osti refers to a hashed potato dish which originated in the canton of Bern and is typical of Swiss German cuisine, and Graben is a trench or division.

Wediscussthisinfurtherdetailinsection2. Weaddtotheexistingliteraturebyfocusingonasetofculturaldimensionsandmechanismsthat 6 might have shaped the actual adherence to social distancing in Switzerland. More precisely, ﬁrst 1 2 - we examine the relationship between average distance travelled in a day and language as a proxy 6 8 1 for culture. Then to further investigate the role of speciﬁc cultural dimensions, we examine the :  0 2 relationshipbetweendailymobilityandasetofspeciﬁcculturaltraitsassociatedwiththelinguistic 0 2 y  background - trust, altruistic beliefs, political leaning and preferences for re-distributive policies. l u J WemeasurethesevaluesandattitudesusingEuropeanSocialSurveyandSwissHouseholdPanel,. 3  2 To capture the adherence to social distancing, we rely on phone location tracking records of 3000 9,  3 individuals,collectedbyIntervistaAGonbehalfoftheSwissFederalStatisticalOﬃce(FSO).Our s  c mi analysis focuses on two important dates. The ﬁrst is February 25, when the ﬁrst COVID-19 case o n wasreportedinSwitzerland,markingthebeginningoftheoutbreakinthecountry. Thesecondis o c E March16,whentheSwissgovernmentdeclaredan“extraordinarysituation”,institutingabanon d  vi allprivateandpubliceventsandclosingplacessuchasrestaurantsandbars. Theperiodbetween o C these two dates would be indicative of voluntary compliance to social distancing while the period post March 16 would be indicative of adherence to oﬃcial measures. In our empirical model, we includecantonanddailyﬁxedeﬀectsandalsocontrolfortime-varyingnumberofCOVID-19cases reportedandfatalitiesatthecantonlevel. Ourspeciﬁcationalsoincludestheinteractionofarich setofbaselinegeographic,demographic,andsocio-economiccantonalcontrolswithtimedummies. This accounts for diﬀerence in mobility levels across cantons and the the common evolution of mobilityinallcantonsinanygiveday.

Lastlyto ensure the eﬀect we are capturing is from our stated cultural dimensions and not other elements COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS189 ofsocialcapital,wealsocontrolforaveragetimespentwatching,readingorlisteningtonewsand fortrustininstitutions. Using this approach, we ﬁnd surprising results showing that cantons in the German linguistic re- gion, which are also characterized by higher levels of generalized trust towards others and more altruisticbeliefs,reducedtheirmobilitysigniﬁcantlylessthantheFrenchspeakingcantons. There- fore,withintheSwisscontext,highinterpersonaltrustisstronglyassociatedwithlowerreductions in individual mobility. These ﬁndings are at odds with Durante et al. (2020) and Brodeur et al. (2020), who document a signiﬁcantly higher decline in mobility in areas with higher civic capital 6 and trust. We attribute these results to the speciﬁc way in which these cultural traits alter the 1 2 - trade-oﬀ behind individual decision on mobility. Reducing mobility becomes less relevant as an 6 8 1 instrument to reduce the probability of contracting (or diﬀusing) the disease if one believes that :  0 2 otherindividualsinsocietywillrespect,amongotherthings,physicaldistanceandotherinfection 0 2 y  prevention and control norms (IPC), thus making mobility reduction less relevant. In a sense, l u J physical distancing replaces social distancing. Additionally it is important to note that German 3  2 speakingcantonsarealsorelativelyrightleaningonthepoliticalscale,supportalimitedroleofthe 9,  3 stateinmatersofwelfareandgreatlyvalueindividualfreedom. Thereforeinthesecantons,reduc- s  c mi ing individual mobility due to government imposition could be perceived as a sacriﬁce of a taller o n orderthaninmorecollectivistregions. Wealsoﬁndpreliminaryevidenceofapossiblemechanism o c E drivingtheseresults: acombinationofhigherinterpersonaltrustandconservativepoliticalattitude d  vi that may have shaped the lower reduction in mobility for the German speaking cantons. Overall, o C our results show that the costs and beneﬁts associated with compliance changes with culture and suggests that contextual conditions, shaped by the culture of reference, are key in determining howtraitssuchasinterpersonaltrust,preferenceforre-distributivepoliciesandpoliticalattitudes, mediate the social distancing process. The paper closest to ours is Mazzonna (2020), who uses a diﬀerentsetofmobilitydataforSwitzerlandandshedslightonthemobilitydiﬀerencesacrossthe German and Latin (French and Italian) speaking regions in Switzerland. While Mazzonna (2020) looks at diﬀerences across the linguistic regions and the role of elderly demographic, our paper decomposes the eﬀect of culture by highlighting the speciﬁc cultural values and beliefs that may explainthesediﬀerencesandalsoexplorestheunderlyingmechanism.

This literature essentially 3 s  builds on The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis also known as the linguistic relativity hypothesis, which c mi highlightshowthelanguageonespeaksinﬂuencesthewayoneperceivestheworld. Thishypothe- o n sisisaculminationofseveralearlycontributionsinanthropologythatexploredthislink,spanning o c E from van Humboldt (1836) to Mandelbaum (1951), Whorf (1956), Sapir (1968) and Boas (1982) d  vi whose work on cultural relativism further highlighted that language and culture were interdepen- o C dent. Severalstudies,acrossvariousdisciplines,haveshownthatanexaminationofculturalgroups can be engaged by language since it has an impact on identity, values, attitudes and behaviour (Heslopetal.(1998);Schulzetal.(2006);Laesseretal.(2014)). Morerecentlyworksofeconomists suchasBisinandVerdier(2011)andGinsburghandWeber(2020)showthatthenotionofacom- mon native language is inextricably linked with cultural proximity. This goes beyond language proﬁciency and ability to speak and in fact captures the vertical and horizontal transmission of values. Generalized trust: Oneofthemostcommonlydeﬁnedculturaltraitisgeneralizedtrusttowards COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS191 others, the beliefs held about others’ trustworthiness. Alesina and La Ferrara (2002) hypothesize that this belief is a moral or cultural attitude and is positively correlated with individual char- acteristics such as the level and type of education received and occurrence of recent misfortunes. Theyalsoshowtheimportanceofcommunitycharacteristicssuchashighincomeinequalitywhich often leads to low interpersonal trust. From the early work of Arrow (1972), who recognized the importance of mutual trust in commercial and noncommercial transactions, the relation between generalized trust and economic development is well established (Algan and Cahuc (2014); Butler et al. (2016)). It is important to note that this diﬀers from the concept of trust in institutions, whichmaysimplybecapturingtheeﬃciencyorcorruptionofthegovernmentinpower. 6 1 2 - Preferences for redistribution: Alesina and Giuliano (2011) deﬁne preferences for redistribu- 6 8 1 tion as a situation in which one agent also cares about the utility of somebody else. They reject :  0 2 thenotionofthesepreferencesbeingunpredictable“socialnoise”andhighlighttheroleofculture 0 2 y  as an important determinant. Diﬀerent cultures may have distinct approaches in contrasting the l u J merits of equality versus individualism. As shown by Alesina and Giuliano (2015), views on in- 3  2 equalityandredistributionemphasizeboththevalueandbelief componentofculture.

Switzerlandhastwenty-sixcantonsandfouroﬃciallanguageshavingequal status in law - German, French, Italian and Romansh. According to the 2000 census, German is spokenby63.7%ofthepopulation,Frenchby20.4%,Italianby6.5%,andRomanshby0.5%. Three cantons-Valais,Fribourg,andBerne-arebilingual(French,German);onecanton-Graubu¨nden - is oﬃcially trilingual (German, Romansh, Italian). From the remaining cantons, seventeen are 6 1 2 German speaking, four French speaking and one Italian speaking. Looking at Panel (a) in Figure - 6 8 1, we observe that there are geographically distinct linguistic regions. These language borders 1 0:  have deep historical roots and with the exception of few minor movements, the early historical 2 0 2 development of the German-French and German-Italian language boundaries have been relatively y  l stable since AD 1100 (Sonderegger et al. (1967); Egger and Lassmann (2015); Bu¨chi (2001)). For u J 3  example,historicallytheborderofthecantonValaistracedalongtheborderoftheRoman-Catholic 2 9,  Diocese of Sion and most of the canton Graubu¨nden was once part of a Roman province called 3 cs  Raetia,whichwasestablishedin15BC,resultinginmultilingualism(Eugsteretal.(2017)).

Thereforetheseexplicitlanguageregionscanbethoughtofaspocketsofdiﬀerent c E d  cultures and the R¨ostigraben exempliﬁes this fact. The language frontier manifests itself through i v o diﬀerent preferences in many aspects of everyday life and provides an ideal context to study the C eﬀects of culture. There are several works of public economics and trade that have exploited this uniquevariationinlanguageswithinSwitzerland(Eugsteretal.(2017),AthiasandWicht(2014), EggerandLassmann(2015)andEugsterandParchet(2011)).

Oneissuethathasalways brought the cultural divide to the forefront is the unemployment insurance (assurance-chˆomage). In 1997 and 2010, the citizens voted on whether there should be further cuts on the ﬁnancing of unemployment beneﬁts. The variation in vote share, as seen in Panel (b) of Figure 1, results in a map with demarcations that look strikingly similar to the language borders seen in Panel (a). Despite the thirteen years gap, note the persistence in the preferences across the cultural borders. Thus one can say the Ro¨stigraben is also reﬂective of the left-leaning voting behavior of theFrench-speakingpart,especiallywhenitcomestosocialpolicyissues(Germannetal.(2012)). 6 2.2 COVID-19 in Switzerland 1 2 - 6 8 TheﬁrstcaseofCOVID-19inSwitzerlandwasconﬁrmedonFebruary25a70-year-oldmantested 1 0:  positive in Ticino, followed by a second case on February 26 in Geneva. Due to its proximity to 2 0 2 Lombardia, Ticino took early restrictive measures while the only rule imposed on the remaining y  l cantons was a relatively moderate step taken by the federal government - to raise the alert level u J 3  to “special situation” by banning events with more than 1,000 people.2 However, by mid March 2 9,  the country was particularly aﬀected by the epidemic, the increase in conﬁrmed cases accelerated 3 cs  withthereproductivenumberoscillatingbetween1.5and2(Scir´eetal.(2020)).

Tomeasureculturaltraitswe 3 cs  usetwosurveys: SwissHouseholdPanel(SHP)3 andEuropeanSocialSurvey(ESS).4 i m o n To assess generalized trust towards others, the survey elicits beliefs by asking - Would you say o c E that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people, if 0 means d  vi “Can’t be too careful” and 10 means “Most people can be trusted”? Using the average intensity o C of trust beliefs we classify cantons as “high trust in others” and “low trust in others”. To gauge interpersonal trust we also look at an additional question - Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or that they are mostly looking out for themselves? Similar to above, the response is on scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means people mostly look out for themselves and 10 means that people mostly try to be helpful. The intended contrast is between self-interest and altruistichelpfulness. Weclassifycantonsas“highaltruisticbeliefs”and“lowaltruisticbeliefs”. 3It is an annual panel study based on a random sample of private households in Switzerland over time.

Figure 6 depicts the results for the ﬁrst cultural dimension, generalized trust towards others. We ﬁnd that after the introduction of federal measures, in cantons with higher trust in others, the mobilitydeclinewasaround6kilometreslessthaninthelowtrustingcantons. Similarly,forphase twoandthreeofthepandemic, cantonswithhigheraltruisticbeliefsreducedtheirmobilityby12 and 8 kilometres less than cantons with lower altruistic beliefs.

Additionally,theirattitudetowardsincomediﬀerencesandpoverty mayreﬂecttheirpositionontheroleofstateandthefactthatthepopulationislikelytobemore uncomfortable with public decisions entailing severe limitations of personal liberties to preserve the social welfare. This is also reﬂected in a recent public survey where a third of Swiss Germans believedthattheclosingofshopsandestablishmentsofpersonalserviceswastooextreme,against COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS203 18%ofSwissFrench.7 ItisalsoofinteresttonotethatmanycantonswithintheGermanlinguistic regionarethestrongholdofTheSwissPeople’sPartyalsoknownastheDemocraticUnionofthe Centre (SVP/UDC), which has consistently won the largest share of votes in the national council since 1999. Ideologically the party stands for the rejection of the expansion of the welfare state, lowertaxationandwasextremelycriticalandvocalduringthepandemictoreopentheeconomy. As discussed in the introduction, a part of our results is at odds with the recent work on civic capital and mobility, and especially the results by Brodeur et al. (2020) who show high-trust Americancountiesdecreasetheirmobilitysigniﬁcantlymorethanlow-trustcountiespost-lockdown. 6 However, our results on political attitudes and the role of state are broadly consistent with the 1 2 - secondﬁndingofBrodeuretal.(2020),thatcountieswithrelativelymoreself-declareddemocrats 6 8 1 decrease signiﬁcantly more their mobility. To understand the possible mechanism driving our :  0 2 results we estimate (3) as displayed in Figure 8. Instead of looking at one cultural dimension at 0 2 y  a time, we introduce a triple interaction between the two cultural dimensions - trust in others l u J and political position on the left-right scale - and the phase time dummies. This allows us to 3  2 gauge the heterogeneity present in our results. Figure 8 shows that, during both phases of the 9,  3 pandemic,theeﬀectofhighertrustinothers,onaveragedailymobility,issigniﬁcantandpositive s  c mi forrightleaningcantonscomparedtotheleftleaningcantonswhereitisnegative andsigniﬁcant. o n This provides some preliminary insight into the the fact that it may have been a combination of o c E higher interpersonal trust and conservative political attitude that shaped the lower reduction in d  vi mobility in the German speaking cantons. This emphasizes the fact that the same cultural traits o C may elicit diﬀerent responses under a crises situation such as a pandemic and that understanding the country speciﬁc context is crucial to policy implementation. It is extremely telling that the SwissgovernmentdidnotimposeanystringentlockdownlikeseveralotherEuropeancountriesand even while preparing for a possible second wave the government is against imposing nationwide lockdownrestrictions. 7This survey was carried out by Sotomo research institute and more information can be found on: https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/11314737–coronagraben-quand-romands-et-alemaniques-ne-vivent-pas-la-meme- crise.html COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS204 6 1 2 - 6 8 1 :  0 2 0 2 y  l u J 3  2 9,  3 s  c i m o n o c E d  i v o C Figure 6: Cultural dimension: Generalized trust towards others.

In an attempt to contain the spread of the virus and reducing the load on the healthcare system, virtually all countries have adopted restrictive measures aimed at reducing individual mobility and inducing social distancing. Interestingly, however, the rate of compliancetosuchmeasureshasvariedenormously. Thispaperexaminestowhatextentcultural diﬀerences can explain these variations. We focus on a speciﬁc set of cultural dimensions that mighthaveshapedtheactualadherencetosocialdistancinginSwitzerland,acountrycharacterized 6 by cultural diﬀerences that vary across its cantons. More precisely, we examine the relationship 1 2 - betweenaveragedistancetravelledinadayandlanguage,trust,altruisticbeliefs,politicalleaning 6 8 1 andpreferencesforre-distributivepolicies. WedocumenthowtheSwissreducedtheirmobilityﬁrst :  0 2 as a (voluntary) response to the outbreak in Ticino and Geneva during the last week of February 0 2 y  and later in response to the federal measures introduced by the government on March 16.

Ourresults 9,  3 suggestthattheperceivedcostsandbeneﬁtsofcomplyingtoindividualmobilityrestrictionsnorms s  c i change with culture. As a consequence, contextual conditions, shaped by the culture of reference, m o n are of critical importance in determining how traits such as interpersonal trust, preference for o c E re-distributivepoliciesandpoliticalattitudes,mediatethesocialdistancingprocess. d  i v o C COVID ECONOMICS  VETTED AND REAL-TIME PAPERS207 References Alesina,A.andP.Giuliano(2011).Preferencesforredistribution.InHandbookofsocialeconomics, Volume1,pp.93–131.Elsevier.

Our dependent variable is now average radius of daily travel. Observe, although the diﬀerenceinreductionofdailymobilitybetweenthetwolinguisticregionsisnotsigniﬁcantlyvery diﬀerent in phase two, it becomes strongly signiﬁcant in phase three. Post federal measures, the German speaking region reduced their radius of daily travel by 5 kilometres less than the French speaking area. This is also clearly visible in the raw data in Figure B.5, where there is a marked diﬀerenceinthemobilitylevelsofthetworegionsafterMarch16. Consistentwithourmainresults, 6 when comparing regions across diﬀerent cultural dimensions we observe a similar trend. Cantons 1 2 - having higher trust, altruistic beliefs and conservative political ideologies reduced their radius of 6 8 1 dailytravelbylesswhencomparedtootherareas.
