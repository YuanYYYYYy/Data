Introduction  The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England has an explicit mandate  to  maintain  CPI  inflation  at  a  target  of  2%.  In  such  an  inflation  targeting  regime,  the  effectiveness of monetary policy is likely to be greater if inflation expectations remain anchored  to the target. People have to believe that there will be low inflation before they stop building  expectations of high inflation into their decision-making process. A sustained rise in inflation  expectations in the short-term runs the risk of heightened inflationary pressures in the medium  term. Hence,  central banks have an incentive to understand how inflation expectations are  formed.  In this paper we review the empirical literature concerning how inflation expectations are  formed.  We then examine empirically how individuals form inflation expectations in the UK by  examining micro-data at the level of the individual drawn from a number of UK surveys of  inflation expectations.  It extends, and updates, earlier work in Blanchflower and Kelly (2008).   We find strong empirical support for heterogeneity in the formation of inflation expectations. We  make use of data from three main sources: the Bank of England’s Inflation Attitudes Surveys  from 2001-2009; the GfK/NOP Consumer Confidence Barometer Surveys from 1996-2008 and a  2007 Eurobarometer Survey. There are high non-response rates in the surveys.  That is, many  respondents have ‘no idea’ what the inflation rate will be in the future. Also, expectations are  backward-looking.  Individual’s  perceptions  of  current  inflation  are  a  highly  significant  determinant of their inflation expectations. However, despite this backward-looking behavior we  still  find  consistent  differences  in  the  formation  of  inflation  expectations  according  to  characteristics such as education, age, income, employment and housing status.   1The formation of inflation expectations is likely to be related to the credibility of the  monetary authority in controlling inflation. We therefore also consider micro data on individuals’  satisfaction with the Bank of England in its job to control inflation. We also consider the  characteristics of those individuals more likely to accurately report current rates of inflation and  predict  future  inflation.  We  find  the  credibility  of  the  monetary  authority  differs  across  individuals according to similar characteristics as those that form their inflation expectations and  in their ability to report and predict inflation.   In  section  2  we  discuss  how  inflation  expectations  may  be  measured  and  recent  movements in inflation expectations. In section 3 we discuss the empirical literature concerning  the formation of inflation expectations. Section 4 describes the empirical evidence for the UK  drawn from a number of surveys of UK households’ inflation expectations. Section 5 concludes.  2. Measuring Inflation Expectations  What matters most for inflation, are the expectations of those directly involved in setting  prices and wages.  Wages are set on an infrequent basis, thus wage setters have to form a view  on future inflation.  If inflation is expected to be persistently higher in the future, employees may  seek higher nominal wages in order to maintain their purchasing power.  This in turn could lead  to  upward  pressure  on  companies’  output  prices,  and  hence  higher  consumer  prices.   Additionally, if companies expect general inflation to be higher in the future, they may be more  inclined to raise prices, believing that they can do so without suffering a drop in demand for their  output.  A third path by which inflation expectations could potentially impact inflation is through  their influence on consumption and investment decisions.  For a given path of nominal market  interest rates, if households and companies expect higher inflation, this implies lower expected  real interest rates, making spending more attractive relative to saving.  But if nominal market  2interest rates rise in response to expectations that the MPC will raise Bank Rate to curtail any  inflationary pressure, real rates might not actually decline.   How can we measure inflation expectations?  Mankiw, Reis and Wolfers (2003) provide  a comprehensive study. We identify three main groups, namely survey-based measures, market- based measures and economic indicators. In the UK there are a range of surveys of inflation  expectations, both of the general public and professional economic forecasters and academics.  There is a dearth of surveys for firms’ inflation expectations although business surveys include  questions concerning firms’ pricing intentions. In this paper we examine in detail those surveys  of the general public for which we can obtain micro data.   Market-based measures of inflation expectations include estimations of nominal and real  forward interest rate curves, from which a forward inflation curve is inferred, and inflation swap  rates. In both these cases, the indicators may not only reflect markets’ inflation expectations but  also  inflation  risk  premia  and  numerous  other  market  factors.  Movements  in  inflation  expectations could also be apparent in economic indicators such as wage settlements, where  wage bargainers must make some judgment regarding the course of inflation over the period of  the settlement. Of course, wage settlement data does not simply reflect inflation expectations but  also factors such as ability to pay and employee productivity.  How have the survey measures of inflation expectations we study in this paper behaved  over the recent past. Chart 1 illustrates that a range of survey measures of household’s inflation  expectations have picked up sharply over the recent past, before falling back in the most recent  surveys.  Charts  2  and  3  illustrate  the  median  inflation  expectation  from  the  Bank  of  England/NOP Inflation Attitudes Survey, together with consumer price inflation (CPI) and retail  3price inflation (RPIX).1 The difference between these two measures is twofold. First, the CPI  measure is calculated using a geometric rather than an arithmetic average. Second, the RPIX  measure includes a measure of housing costs, whereas the CPI does not. Finally, up until the  beginning of 2004 the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) set monetary  policy relative to a target of 2.5% for the RPIX measure. Since 2004 the MPC has set monetary  policy relative to a target of 2.0% for the CPI measure. Hence, this change in target means it is  difficult to judge how inflation expectations have behaved relative to the Bank of England’s  inflation targeting regime. It appears that up to 2004 at least that the median inflation expectation  in the Bank of England Inflation Attitudes survey was closer to the RPIX inflation measure  (Chart 3) than it was to CPI (Chart 2).  Over the recent past RPIX inflation has fallen below CPI inflation, and a third measure of  retail price inflation which includes mortgage interest payments, the RPI, has fallen below zero  following large cuts in the Bank of England’s policy rate (Chart 4). This could suggest that  some agents in the economy may perceive different rates of inflation; in particular, mortgage  holders who will have seen their mortgage interest payments fall sharply in the recent past. Our  survey measures of inflation expectations and perceptions do not specify a particular measure of  inflation.  So  we  must  be  careful  in  assessing  the  behavior  of  inflation  expectations  and  perceptions relative to the Bank of England’s target.  Despite these caveats there are a number of key points with respect to the behavior of  inflation expectations we should highlight. First, median inflation expectations remained broadly  stable, in the range of 2%-3%, through the period 1999-2006 as the Bank of England maintained  inflation close to target. Second, during this period inflation expectations moved closely with                                                    1 For details of the surveys, plus the latest data see http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/nop/index.htm     4inflation perceptions (Chart 5). This could be consistent with backward-looking behavior by  agents in forming their inflation expectations, but also with forward-looking behavior in the  sense that agents expected the Bank of England to maintain inflation close to target.   Third, as rising oil, energy and food prices pushed CPI inflation above the inflation target  to a peak of 5.2% in September 2008, this coincided with a rise in median inflation expectations.  Median inflation expectations picked up sharply, though not as much as actual inflation on all  three measures, through 2007-2008 before falling back very sharply to their lowest level since  2005 in February 2009. Fourth, the survey responses have become more volatile in the last two  years. Charts 6 and 7 illustrate a swathe of distributions of the survey responses to the Bank of  England Inflation Attitudes survey in the periods 2001-2006 and 2007-2009 respectively. Table  1 illustrates the entire distribution of responses. In the May and August 2008 surveys 37% and  36% of respondents expected inflation to be greater than 5% in twelve months time, but this  proportion fell to 21% and 16% in the November 2008 and February 2009 surveys. Between  August and November 2008 the proportion of respondents expecting prices to not change or go  down rose from 6% to 27%.   Hence,  in  our  analysis  of  the  Bank/NOP  micro  data  we  consider  the  behavior  of  respondents in two distinct periods. First, in the period when inflation remained close to Bank of  England’s target in 2001-2006 and second, in the period 2007-2009 when inflation has exceeded  the  target  by  more  than  1.0pp  and  the  volatility  of  both  inflation  and  surveyed  inflation  expectations has increased.  It is worth considering how wages may have responded to inflation expectations. Chart 8  illustrates that wage settlements showed little response to both the rise in CPI inflation or median  inflation expectations over the course of 2008. Rather, wage growth began to fall back as firms  5cut back on hiring. And over the recent past sharp cuts in bonuses have pushed down on the AEI  measure of average earnings. In summary, it has been difficult to detect any strong link between  wage settlements, earnings or survey measures of inflation expectations.  3. How are inflation expectations formed?   In the neo-Keynesian model (see, for example, Clarida et al. 2000), sticky prices result in  forward looking behaviour; inflation today is a function of expected future inflation as well as  the pressure of demand, captured in an output gap term.  Thus, expectations are deemed to be an  important link in the monetary transmission mechanism. Monetary policy can be more successful  when long-term inflation expectations are well anchored.   Hence, many studies have focused on the question of how to assess the response of  inflation  expectations  to  macroeconomic  shocks,  and  whether  this  is  likely to  be  lower  in  inflation  targeting  regimes.2  Bernanke  (2007)  provides  an  intuitive  definition  for  anchored  inflation expectations, namely that if the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their  long run expectation, but their long run expectation of inflation changes little as a result, inflation  expectations can be considered to be well anchored.  However, if the public reacts to a short  period of higher than expected inflation by increasing their long run expectations, expectations  are poorly anchored.  Levin,  Natalucci  and  Piger  (2004)  show  that  some  survey  measures  of  inflation  expectations in the US respond to recent changes in the actual rate of inflation, which would not  be  the  case  if  expectations  were  perfectly  anchored.    They  examine  whether  inflation  expectations  are  relatively  more  anchored  in  inflation  targeting  economies  by  estimating  a  pooled regression (across inflation targeting and non-inflation targeting countries) in order to                                                    2 See for example Stock and Watson (2007).    6evaluate the sensitivity of inflation expectations to realised inflation. They find that longer-run  inflation expectations have been far less sensitive in inflation targeting countries, suggesting that  inflation targeting central banks have been quite successful in de-linking expectations from  realised inflation. The authors find some evidence that inflation persistence (for core CPI) is  higher amongst non-inflation targeting countries.  In two empirical studies using expectations based on market data Gurnayak et al (2002,  2003) provide evidence that US nominal forward rates at long horizons react significantly to  surprises in macroeconomic data releases and monetary policy announcements, while forward  rates derived from inflation-indexed Treasury debt show little sensitivity to these shocks. This  suggests  the  response  of  nominal  forward  rates  is  mostly  driven  by  changes  in  inflation  expectations.  However, they note that in the UK long-term forward rates have not demonstrated  excess sensitivity since the Bank of England achieved independence.  Mishkin (2007) notes that  in the US inflation persistence rose during the 1970s and has subsequently fallen back consistent  with  a  re-anchoring  of  inflation  expectations.  This  hypothesis  is  consistent  with  various  indicators of inflation expectations, for example estimates of inflation compensation derived  from indexed Treasury yields.3   However, although there may be some consensus that inflation expectations have become  more  anchored,  and  perhaps  more  so  in  inflation  targeting  countries,  these  studies  do  not  explicitly consider how inflation expectations are themselves formed. Rational expectations has  been the traditional framework used for modeling inflation targeting.  Agents are assumed to  share a common information set and form expectations conditional on that information.  Thus,                                                    3 Similar evidence concerning inflation persistence is found for other countries.  Levin and Piger (2004) find that  there has been a significant decline in inflation persistence since the 1980s for major European economies as well as  for Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  However, O’Reilly and Whelan (2005) find little evidence of a  recent decline in persistence for the Euro area as a whole.  7we assume that everyone has the same expectations.  However, this implies the public has firm  knowledge of the long-run equilibrium inflation rate.  This gives rise to a conflict between policy  practice and policy modeling, which is well described by Orphanides and Williams (2003).   Generally, models assume a fixed and perfectly known structure of the economy and specify that  expectations are model consistent.  In linear fixed parameter models, for example, once the  monetary policy rule is specified, inflation expectations can be represented as a fixed linear  function  of  economic  outcomes.    Economic  agents  are  then  assumed  to  form  expectations  mechanically based on these simple linear functions of economic outcomes that are assumed to  be perfectly known.  In such a world, expectations are perfectly anchored, and as such there is no  need for central banks to monitor and analyse information regarding inflation expectations, and  no need for central bank communications.   However,  once  imperfect  knowledge  is  acknowledged,  the  mechanical  link  from  economic outcomes to the expectations formation process breaks down.  There have been a large  number of papers documenting the general failure of the rational expectations hypothesis to  account for the survey data on inflation expectations (for example Pacquet, 1992, Batchelor and  Dua, 1987). A widely cited explanation for the failure is that agents lack the sophistication to  form expectations rationally.  The presence of information costs is a major factor.  To form  rational expectations, agents must know the time structure and probability distribution of the  economy, and the costs of information may exceed the benefits, making it rational for agents to  form  their  expectations  some  other  way.    Most  empirical  tests  of  rationality  of  surveyed  expectations  have  focused  on  the  inflationary  expectations  of  economists  (e.g.  Keane  and  Runkle, 1990), although a few studies have examined inflationary expectations of consumers in  general, mainly using aggregated Michigan survey data (Maddala, Fishe and Lahiri (1981),  8Gramlich (1983),  Batchelor (1986)).  However, these  studies  suffer from  aggregation bias,  meaning that the implications of tests for individual rationality are difficult to derive.   More recently, a few studies have attempted to empirically test rationality of expectation  formation  on  an  individual  basis  (Bakhshi  and  Yates  (1988)  provide  a  review  of  tests  of  rationality  commonly  used  in  the  literature).    Souleles  (2004),  for  example,  seeks  to  test  rationality  of  consumer  expectations  (including  inflation  expectations)  by  looking  at  the  relationship between answers to the US Michigan survey over a number of years, in order to  capture an individual’s expectational error.  They find that expectations appear to have been  biased, but that the bias is inconsistent, and related to inflation regime and business cycle.   In a similar approach to Souleles (2004), Mitchell and Weale (2007) use the British  Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to test the rationality of individual-level expectational data in  Britain.  They  statistically  identify  the  characteristics  of  individuals  for  whom  the  costs  of  forming rational expectations exceed the benefits.  They find that the British are more optimistic  about the future when they have recently seen their household income rise, and vice versa.   Using a regime switching model, they find that 40% of individuals form expectations consistent  with rationality, and that the propensity to form rational expectations increases with age rather  than education.  However, they do not investigate the alternative model used by the other 60% to  form their expectations.    Another  class  of  study  has  investigated  empirically  the  increasing  consensus  that  expectation formation is heterogeneous across agents.  Three main possible reasons for this  heterogeneity have been proposed.  First, reliance of agents on different models; second, the use  of different information sets by agents; and third, agents have different capacities for processing  information.    Using  US  Michigan  data,  Branch  (2004)  finds  evidence  that  agents  rely  on  9different  models  and  use  different  information  sets.    He  looks  at  rationally  heterogeneous  expectations, stemming from the notion of Adaptively Rational Equilibrium Dynamics (ARED)  proposed by Brock and Hommes (1997).  Under this framework, agents forecast inflation rates  using a predictor function chosen from an increasingly sophisticated set of alternative predictors;  the probability of any predictor being chosen depends on its relative net benefit.  His results  show  that  agents  do  dynamically  select  predictor  functions.    This  suggests  that  rational  expectations are not rejected because agents blindly follow an ad-hoc rule; rather because it is  not worthwhile for them to invest the effort to use more complex predictor functions.  Agents are  rationally heterogeneous in the sense that each predictor choice is individually optimal.  Carroll (2003) focuses on the idea that agents use different data sets to form expectations.   He proposes an epidemiology framework to study how households model inflation expectations.  In the framework, household expectations are updated probabilistically towards the views of  professional forecasters – i.e. people obtain macroeconomic news from the media, but that it  takes time to dissipate.  He finds differences between household expectations and the views of  professional forecasters narrow when inflation is more significant, probably because of increased  media coverage and household interest.  His model is successful in capturing much of the  variation in the Michigan survey measures of inflation expectations.   Models of learning allow us to abstract from the idea that agents have full information  about the economy and the objectives of the central bank; instead individuals make statistical  inferences about the unknown parameters governing the evolution of the economy.  Pfajfar and  Santoro (2006) focus on learning and information stickiness as the roots of the heterogeneity in  expectation formation between agents.  Using data from the Michigan survey, they identify three  regions  of  a  distribution  corresponding  to  different  expectation  formation  processes,  which  1 0display a heterogeneous response to the main macroeconomic indicators.  On the left hand side  of the distribution, a static or lightly autoregressive group, in the middle a nearly rational group,  and on the right hand side a group of agents behaving according to adaptive learning and sticky  information.  The latter respond in too pessimistic a manner, overacting to macroeconomic  fluctuations.    Similar  to  Carroll  (2003),  they  find  that  agents  are  more  likely  to  update  information  sets  regularly  when  inflation  matters.  Pfajfar  and  Santoro  (2008)  extend  this  approach to different demographic groups. They find that income, education and gender are  important characteristics when forecasting inflation. Those with higher income, education and  male agents tend to make smaller errors in their inflation forecasts.   Orphanides and Williams (2003) also look at the implications of learning.  They find that  the presence of learning increases the sensitivity of inflation expectations and the term structure  of interest rates to economic shocks, in line with empirical evidence.  They find that inflation  expectations under learning are much less sensitive to inflation when the inflation target is  assumed to be known by the public, indicating that the benefit of better anchored inflation  expectations that is associated with successful communication of the central bank’s inflation  target can be significant.  This is consistent with the experience of the UK following the adoption  of inflation targeting.   4.  Empirical evidence  We now turn to empirical evidence on the formation of inflation expectations among the  UK population. Survey responses may be highly influenced by the structure and precise nature of  the questions asked. So we consider evidence from a range of surveys conducted in the UK  where  respondents  provide  quantitative,  qualitative  and  point  estimates  for  their  inflation  expectations.  We find consistent characteristics such as age, education and relative income  1 1influence the formation of inflation expectations. Of course, inflation expectations should be  highly influenced by monetary policy. We find that similar characteristics, as those that lead to  lower inflation expectations, are also associated with confidence in the Bank of England to  control inflation.  4.1. The Bank of England/NOP Inflation Attitudes Survey: Inflation Expectations  Since 1999 the Bank of England has conducted a regular survey of attitudes to inflation  expectations. Each survey covers around 2000 individuals, with an additional 2000 taking part in  an extended survey every February. The sample is designed and weighted to ensure that it is  representative of the known population data on age, gender, social class and region. Aggregated  data are available quarterly from November 19994. We have obtained the micro data at the level  of the individual from twenty seven of these quarterly surveys, beginning in February 2001  through to February 2009. These are not panels; the same people are not interviewed repeatedly,  rather they are repeat cross-sections. We have pooled these surveys together. In total there are  64,334 responses.  In each survey the following question is asked "How much would you expect  prices in the shops generally to change over the next 12 months?” The full distribution of  responses is presented in Table 1.   The median response has risen from a low of 1.7% in November 2001 to a high of 4.4%  in August 2008, but has fallen back very sharply to 2.1% in the February 2009 survey. Chart 5  suggests that up to 2007 median inflation expectations had been largely backward-looking.  Indeed,  up  to  2007  on  average  49.9%  of  respondents  indicated  that  their  expectations  for  inflation were in the same range as their perceptions of current inflation. This may not be too                                                    4 Summaries of the aggregate responses in each survey are available on the Bank of England's website.  On a yearly  basis since 2001 the Bank of England has published an article in its Quarterly Bulletin discussing the results of the  survey - the latest available is Benford and Driver (2008).       1 2surprising in a period when the Bank of England succeeded in maintaining inflation close to  target. Given the costs of predicting inflation, imperfect information sets and capacity to form  such projections a backward-looking rule of thumb may not have been irrational when consumer  price inflation was relatively stable.  Since  the  beginning  of  2007  median  inflation  expectations  have  diverged  from  perceptions (Chart 5) at the same time that consumer price inflation has become more volatile.  Similarly, the distribution of survey responses has become more volatile since 2007 (Charts 6  and 7). We therefore consider which groups may be more or less backward-looking in forming  their inflation expectations? This is clearly related to a second question in the Bank of England  Inflation Attitudes survey which we also consider: “Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you  with the way the Bank of England is doing its job to set interest rates in order to control  inflation?”   It is important to examine the distribution of non-responses because if it is non-random it  may bias any results. Table 2 illustrates the non-responses to the inflation expectations question.  The equation estimated is a dprobit to calculate the probability that respondents will reply that  they have ‘no idea’.5  If the respondent reported they had 'no idea' the dependent variable was set  to one, zero otherwise. Worryingly the probability of a non-response is higher for females, the  young,  the  less  educated,  those  on  lowest  incomes,  not  in  employment  and  those  renting                                                    5 Dprobit in STATA fits maximum-likelihood probit models and is an alternative to probit.  Rather than reporting  the coefficients, dprobit reports the marginal effect, that is the change in the probability for an infinitesimal change  in each independent, continuous variable and, by default, reports the discrete change in the probability for dummy  variables.     1 3accommodation6. The concern is that any results may be biased because of the relative exclusion  of these groups. So we proceed with caution.  Table 3 moves on to model inflation expectations econometrically, using the micro data  from  the  Inflation  Attitudes  survey  from  February  2001  through  to  February  20097.  The  dependent variable is expected inflation twelve months ahead. All respondents reporting they  had 'no idea' are dropped.  Because there are open ends and intervals within the survey responses  the procedure used here is interval regression.  A positive coefficient means the individual  expects higher prices and vice versa.  The model is consistently estimated by a maximum  likelihood procedure. We have micro data available on around 60,000 individuals from twenty  seven sweeps of the survey extending from February 2001.  There are approximately 2,500 left- censored observations, 10,000 right-censored observations and 47,000 interval observations.    In the first column of Table 3 we simply include survey month dummies.  A number of  facts stand out: first, there is relatively little movement in the size of the coefficients on the  month dummies up to the period 2007-2009. Second, there was a dramatic increase in the size of  the coefficients as the impact of the oil shock hit from November 2007 to August 2008. Third,  the rapid deterioration in the size of the coefficients in the last two surveys.  February 2009 is  insignificantly different from February 2001.  Column 2 adds controls for age, gender, education,  employment and housing status. It is striking that the time series patterns of the survey date  dummies change little. Inflation expectations tend to rise with age up to 65. The least educated  and those in rented accommodation also report higher expected inflation rates. There is no                                                    6 Unfortunately we do not have responses according to income for all of the surveys. In alternative specifications of  the dprobit those on lower incomes have higher non-response rates. The tables for these exercises are available upon  request.  7  The  February  surveys  are  twice  as  large  as  the  surveys  in  a  particular  year:  the  February  surveys  have  approximately 4,000 respondents compared with approximately 2,000 in other months.    1 4significant difference in the inflation expectations of workers and non-workers. Males tend to  have higher inflation expectations, but we take this result with caution as it is not robust across  different specifications of the equation, and subject to the caveat regarding the non-responses of  females.  What  can  we  say  about  the  recent  divergence  in  perceptions  and  expectations  of  inflation? Column 3 re-estimates the equation in column 2 but restricts itself to data taken from  the most recent survey in February 2009.8  The main difference between the coefficients on the  control variables is the big increase in the absolute size of the coefficient for those individuals  who have a mortgage who may have seen big declines in their mortgage interest payments  following cuts in the Bank of England’s policy rate.    The coefficients on education dummies are more negative in February 2009 than in the  earlier period. This could suggest that those with higher education are less likely to base their  inflation expectations on their perceptions of current inflation, especially at a time when inflation  has fallen back sharply from a peak of 5.2% in late 2008. We discuss this in more detail below.  Column 4 tests for whether the differences observed between the coefficients in columns  2 and 3 are significant by including a set of interaction terms between the control variables and  the February 2009 dummy. Experiments were done with interactions with other variables that  were always insignificant and hence were omitted.  The evidence is that mortgage holders, men  and the more educated have significantly lower expectations in February 2009 than previously.   Column  5  now  adds  the  perceptions  of  inflation  over  the  preceding  twelve  month  period.  Interestingly 49% of individuals gave exactly the same response to the question on perceptions  as they did on their expectations on average over 2001-2009.  This fell to 32% in February 2009.                                                     8 These data were unavailable to Blanchflower and Kelly (2008).      1 5It is not surprising then that perceptions of past inflation are a major determinant of perceptions.  However, even when controlling for inflation perceptions the impact of gender, age, education  and employment and housing status identified in previous regressions are robust.   Furthermore, the interaction terms for the February 2009 survey remain significant. This  suggests that these groups lowered their expectations more quickly than other groups, perhaps  because their expectations are less backward-looking. We investigate this hypothesis further by  conducting  similar  regressions,  where  we  restrict  the  observations  to  each  category  of  educational attainment. Table 4 illustrates that perceptions of current inflation have less of an  influence on inflation expectations than for those with higher education. The coefficients in  column 1 for inflation perceptions are significantly smaller than those in column 3 when the  same regression is conducted on those with the highest educational attainment.  Of course, using  inflation perceptions as a rule of thumb in forming inflation expectations may be more rational  when inflation is close to target, and there is confidence in the monetary authority to maintain  inflation close to that target. However, over the recent past inflation has been volatile. So when  inflation exceeds the target such a rule of thumb may be less successful in accurately forming  inflation expectations. Columns 4-6 illustrate that over the recent past inflation expectations have  had a much smaller influence on the inflation expectations of the most educated. Indeed, for this  group inflation perceptions are not significant, or have only a marginal significance. This could  suggest that those with higher educational attainment are less likely to be backward-looking in  the formation of their inflation expectations. Chart 9 helps illustrate this behavior by plotting  median inflation expectations by educational attainment. In the very latest survey, February  2009, median inflation expectations for those with the highest educational attainment were 1.3pp  1 6lower than those with the lowest educational attainment. Over the period 2001-2009 this gap had  averaged just 0.4pp.  4.2 The GfK/NOP Consumer Confidence Barometer   Micro data on inflation expectations in the UK are also available from a further data  source.  The  GfK/NOP  Consumer  Confidence  Barometer  (CCB)  survey  collects  nationally  representative data for those aged 16+ from a random sample of telephone owning households.  Sample sizes are approximately 2000 per month. These data are collected monthly across each  member state of the European Union, and for the UK are available since 1985.9  We have only  obtained access to the micro-data since 1996.  The main aim of the GfK CCB survey is to monitor the general public's confidence in the  British economy; measuring consumer confidence in the present economic climate in the UK,  and consumer expectations for the year ahead. We have obtained access to the micro data from  the CCB survey taken monthly from January 1996 through October 2008, making 154 monthly  surveys in all and a total of 312,599 observations. In the CCB survey respondents are asked a  slightly different, qualitative, question on price expectations to the one used in the Bank of  England’s Inflation Attitudes survey: "Q6. In comparison with the past 12 months, how do you  expect consumer prices will develop in the next 12 months? They will…increase more rapidly;  increase at the same rate: increase at a slower rate; stay about the same; fall or don’t know."    The distribution of the responses is reported in Table 5. It is evident that non-responses  are much lower than in the Bank of England Inflation Attitudes survey, on average 5% report                                                    9 GfK has been conducting a monthly consumer survey called the Consumer Confidence Barometer (CCB) in the  UK since June 1995. GfK carries out this survey on behalf of the European Commission, who sponsors the same  consumer survey in all EU and EU candidate countries, as part of the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business  and Consumer programme (known as the BCS programme). The BCS program was first launched by the European  Commission in 1961 (although the programme did not extend to the consumer sector until 1972).    1 7that they don’t know. This is consistent with the well known problem in social science research -  non-responses tend to be higher when quantitative responses are asked for – more accuracy is  obtained at the price of lower response rates. As in the Inflation Attitudes Survey the CCB  survey indicates inflation expectations rose sharply through 2007 up to August 2008 but then fell  sharply. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6 describe the estimates from an ordered logit where 1 is set  to equal a fall while 5 means 'increase more rapidly', so a positive coefficient implies a higher  increase and vice versa for a negative coefficient. An ordered logit fits the responses to an  ordinal  or  qualitative  variable.    The  actual  values  taken  on  by  the  dependent  variable  are  irrelevant, except that larger values are assumed to correspond to 'higher' outcomes.10 The 'no  ideas' respondents are excluded. The controls available from the survey are region, age, gender  and work status.  We include eleven year dummies and month dummies for 2008.  In column 2  we also include controls for the respondents views on what had happened to prices over the  preceding twelve months, including the 'no ideas'.11   Males believe that prices will rise more slowly than females as do the more highly  educated compared to the less highly educated.  This contrasts with the evidence from the Bank  of England Inflation Attitudes Survey where males expect higher rates of increase. Consistent  with the findings from the Inflation Attitudes survey, expectations are higher among older age  groups, females and the least educated. We also find that expectations are higher among non- workers and in London. As in the Inflation Attitudes Survey individuals’ perceptions of inflation  are a highly significant determinant of their expectations (column 2).                                                     10 Use of ordered logits is commonplace in the analysis of happiness data which is similarly ordered - see  Blanchflower and Oswald (2004).    11 We also experimented with replacing the year and month dummies with the monthly CPI.  In this case there are  154  separate  monthly  observations,  but  when  the  standard  errors  were  clustered  this  variable  was  always  insignificant whether or not there were year or month dummies included.  Hence the variable was dropped.    1 8Since 2003 the CCB has asked two additional questions where respondents provide point  estimates of inflation expectations and perceptions: “Estimate by how much consumer prices will  rise by over next 12 months. Estimate up to 1dp?” and “estimate of how much consumer prices  have risen by over past 12 months. Estimate up to 1dp".  Interestingly, 44.7% of respondents  reported  zero  as  their  answer  to  the  inflation  expectations  question,  while  5.7%  reported  estimates between 20% and 100%.  For the second question on inflation perceptions 42.2% of  respondents reported zero as their answer.  The concern here is that people believed they were  reporting on changes in inflation rather than in prices.    Column 3 estimates an Ordinary Least  Squares (OLS) regression with the dependent variable the exact inflation rate expected.  Column  4 includes the perception of the rate over the last twelve months. Column 5 excludes anyone who  reported a zero to either question.  Hence sample size is approximately halved.  This exercise  provides further evidence that inflation expectations are backward-looking and that the least  educated, non-workers and males tend to have lower inflation expectations.  4.3:  The  Bank of England Inflation Attitudes Survey: Satisfaction  with the Monetary  Authority   The success of an inflation targeting regime is grounded in the credibility of the central  bank, and the ability of the central bank to educate those whose expectations in turn impact  monetary policy.  The Bank of England Inflation Attitudes survey includes a question intended  to capture confidence amongst the general public in the monetary authority to control inflation:  “how satisfied are you with how the Bank of England is doing its job to set interest rates to  control inflation?”  Responses ranged from very dissatisfied; dissatisfied; neither; satisfied and  very satisfied plus ‘no idea’. Of course, the risk of analyzing survey responses to this question is  that they may be confused by other factors such as the impact of monetary policy on changes on  1 9mortgage interest payments, or the broader macroeconomic factors such as the unemployment  rate.   Table 7 reports the views of respondents in the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes  Surveys to this question. Overall, a far greater proportion of respondents have been consistently  satisfied, or very satisfied with the job the Bank of England has been doing than those saying  they were not satisfied. But since the end of 2006 the proportion of respondents reporting  dissatisfaction with the Bank of England has been rising sharply. This period coincides both with  rising inflation but also with the adverse impact on the broader economy from the credit crunch.   As with the inflation expectations question, it is important to consider the non-response  rates in case they may be biased. On average, thirteen percent of respondents said they had 'no  idea' how well the Bank was doing in controlling inflation. Interestingly, this total fell to a low of  just 9% in the most recent February 2009 survey. A comparison with Table 2 illustrates that  similar groups did not respond to the satisfaction question, as in the inflation expectations  question: females, the young, the least educated and those in rented accommodation.  Table 8  uses the micro data pooled across the eight years 2001-2009 to estimate an ordered logit and  includes controls for age, gender, schooling, housing tenure; working or not working, year  dummies and region of residence. A positive coefficient thus implies an individual is more  satisfied and a negative one implies less satisfied. Individuals who reported they had 'no idea' are  excluded and hence sample size is now just over fifty-six thousand in column 1.    Column 1 of Table 8 suggests that satisfaction with the Bank of England is lower among  women, those in rented accommodation, the least educated and the young. Satisfaction rises with  age. These results are stable across the various specifications. Interestingly, satisfaction with how  the Bank is doing its job rises linearly with age, being highest with those aged 65 and over.  2 0Satisfaction is higher among home owners and lower among renters.  The time dummies suggest  growing dissatisfaction with the Bank's performance over time. With the exception of age, it  appears that those groups who expect lower inflation, even after taking account of their inflation  perceptions, such as home owners and the more educated are also those groups that are more  likely to believe the Bank of England is able to control inflation.  How do we interpret the recent deterioration in satisfaction with the Bank of England?  The interaction terms indicate that satisfaction has fallen across all age groups, education is not  significant and that mortgage holders are less dissatisfied with the Bank. This could be because  the recent responses reflect broader macroeconomic developments such as the credit crisis and  falling mortgage interest payments rather than a lack of confidence in the Bank to meet the  inflation target.  4.4 Accuracy in reporting current inflation and predicting inflation  In this section we examine the degree of individuals’ knowledge of the 'official' inflation  rate  using  retrospective  data  from  the  Eurobarometer  Survey  #67.2:  European  Union  Enlargement, Personal Data Privacy, the National Economy, and Scientific Research, April-May  2007.  This survey was conducted across all EU countries but we restrict ourselves to the  approximately 1300 observations on UK residents.  Given that inflation perceptions play a large  role in the formation of inflation expectations, to the extent those perceptions capture the true  inflation rate will be important. We then use data from the February 2005, 2006 and 2007 Bank  of England Inflation Attitude Surveys to determine the accuracy of respondent's predictions of  what will happen to prices over the following twelve months compared to the actual observed  outcomes.   a) Inflation in 2006  2 1In the Eurobarometer survey respondents were asked the following question - "What was the  official inflation rate, the rate of which consumer prices increased or decreased, in 2006? I can  tell you that the exact figure is between -1% and 20%?".  It is possible to compare the responses  to this question with the actual inflation rates, although it is uncertain precisely which rate is  being referred to.  In 2006 the CPI averaged 2.3% while the RPI averaged 3.2%.  To allow some  margin of error we assume a response was 'correct' and set to zero if the response was in the  interval of 1.3% to 4.2%, zero otherwise.  Individuals who did not know were also set to zero.   According to this criterion 25.9% of respondents reported correctly.  In column 1 of Table 9 we  report a dprobit modeling the probability of an individual reporting the correct answer.  The  probability of doing so is higher the higher the level of education, among men, and is higher  among workers especially among employed professionals and managers.  The probability rises in  an inverted U-shape in age maximizing at age 59 and declining thereafter.   b) Inflation in 2006 compared with inflation in 2005.  Respondents were also asked a further question on inflation – "Do you think that the inflation  rate in 2006 was higher, lower or equal to the one in 2005?"  Given that both the CPI and the RPI  were lower in 2005 (2.1% and 2.8% respectively), in column 2 of Table 9 we model the  probability of an individual reporting that inflation in 2006 was higher than it had been in 2005  using the Eurobarometer data once again.  Analogously to the reports on the level of inflation,  males, the more highly  educated workers and especially managers  were more likely  to  be  'correct'.    c) Predicting inflation twelve months ahead  In Table 10 we examine the probability that an individual in the Bank of England survey  ‘correctly’ forecasts what inflation will be twelve months ahead.  We do this using the February  2 2surveys of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 and then compare these responses with the percentage  change in prices that occurred over the next twelve months.  A 'correct' response is taken to be  within a 1% interval of the CPI on the low side (CPI was 2.0% in February 2006, 2.8% in  February 2007 and 2.5% in February 2008) and a 1% interval on the high side for the RPI (2.4%;  4.6%  and  4.1%  respectively).    Columns  1  through  3  are  for  February  2005  through  2007  respectively while column 4 pools the three years and adds two year dummies.  As was found  above, the probability of being 'correct' is higher among males, home owners, workers, the more  educated, richer individuals, those aged 55-64 and residents of the South East.  5. Conclusions   What are the conclusions from our findings? First, there is evidence that significant  numbers of individuals do not know what the inflation rate is, how it has changed and are unable  to predict how it might change in the future. This is consistent with recent evidence from the  United States suggesting very low levels of financial literacy. Second, there are high non- response rates to those surveys on how satisfied respondents are with the Bank of England in its  role  in  controlling  inflation.  Non-responses  are  especially  high  among  the  least  educated,  females, the poorest individuals and the young. So at least for some groups their inflation  expectations, either implicit or explicit, are unlikely to be anchored to the inflation target.  We  find  that  age,  gender,  income,  housing  status  and  education  are  important  characteristics in forming inflation expectations12. The more highly educated and those with  higher incomes are more optimistic about the path of prices, believing they will rise at a slower  pace than younger, less educated and less affluent individuals.                                                    12 Unfortunately we do not have responses according to income for all of the surveys. In alternative specifications of  the interval regressions those on lower incomes tend to have higher inflation expectations, and those on higher  incomes lower inflation expectations. The tables for these exercises are available upon request.  2 3We find that price expectations are backward-looking. Perceptions of current inflation are  highly significant determinant of inflation expectations. However, perceptions of inflation are a  less important consideration for the more highly educated. Similarly, the most educated are more  likely to be satisfied that the Bank of England in its role in controlling inflation. This could help  explain  both  their  lower  inflation  expectations  and  why  perceptions  of  inflation  are  less  important in determining their inflation expectations.  These  results  are  similar  to  those  of  Pfajfar  and  Santoro  (2008)  with  respect  to  demographic factors that influence inflation expectations as measured by the University of  Michigan survey for the U.S who found that males, the more highly educated and those with  higher incomes are more likely to accurately report the current level of, and predict inflation.  The main explanations for heterogeneity in the formation of inflation expectations that  have been proposed in the literature are that agents rely on different models, may have different  information sets, or have different capacities for processing information. The results presented in  this paper regarding the more highly educated provide some justification for this approach. First,  perceptions of current inflation are less important for this group in their forecasts for inflation in  the  future. Second,  intuitively  we  would  expect  this  group  can  employ  more  sophisticated  models in forming their expectations, and may have a greater capacity to process information.  Hence,  this  paper  provides  empirical  support  for  models  of  heterogeneity  in  inflation  expectations formation.      2 425    Table 1: Responses to Bank of England Inflation Attitudes Survey, 1999-2009.
