Introduction  1.  In the years that followed the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2009, the Committee’s reforms  of its prudential framework have enhanced the supervision of the global banking system and  resulted in a number of structural changes to strengthen banks’ financial resilience. While  significantly higher levels of capital and liquidity have improved banks’ ability to absorb financial  shocks, the Committee believes that further work is necessary to strengthen banks’ ability to  absorb operational risk-related events, such as pandemics, cyber incidents, technology failures  or natural disasters, which could cause significant operational failures or wide-scale disruptions  in financial markets. In light of the critical role that banks play in the operation of the global  financial infrastructure, increasing their resilience would provide additional safeguards to the  financial system.  2.  Even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Committee considered that significant operational  disruptions would inevitably test improvements to the financial system’s resilience made since  the GFC. As the Covid-19 pandemic progressed, the Committee observed banks rapidly adapting  their operational posture in response to new hazards or changes in existing hazards that occurred  in different parts of their organisation. Recognising that a range of potential hazards cannot be  prevented, the Committee believes that a pragmatic, flexible approach to operational resilience  can enhance the ability of banks to withstand, adapt to and recover from potential hazards and  thereby mitigate potentially severe adverse impacts.   3.  Through the publication of this consultative document, the Committee seeks to promote a  principles-based approach to improving operational resilience. The approach builds on updates  to the Committee’s Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk (PSMOR),1 and  draws  from  previously  issued  principles  on  corporate  governance  for  banks,  as  well  as  outsourcing-,  business  continuity-  and  relevant  risk  management-related  guidance.  The  concurrent publication of the PSMOR and principles for operational resilience provides an  opportunity to consider further streamliming of the Committee’s set of related guidance in this  area. The Committee also intends to use the consultation process to reflect any initial lessons  learned from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.   4.  Recognising the work undertaken by several jurisdictions and standard-setting bodies to bolster  the operational resilience of the financial sector,2 the Committee aims to strengthen operational  resilience by furthering international engagement and seeks to promote greater cross-sectoral  collaboration over this body of work.     1   Consultative  Document:  Revisions  to  the  principles  for  sound  management  of  operational  risk,  6  August  2020,   https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d508.htm  2   Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority, Building the UK financial sector's operational resilience (December 2019); The  European Commission, Digital Operational Resilience Framework for financial services: Making the EU financial sector more  secure (December 2019); the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Ensuring Safe Management and Operational Resilience of the  Financial Sector (April 2020), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), Principles on Outsourcing  (May 2020).

All comments may be published on the website of the  Bank  for  International  Settlements  unless  a  respondent  specifically  requests  confidential  treatment.  II.  An evolving operational risk landscape  6.  Until recently, some of the most predominant operational risks that banks faced resulted from  vulnerabilities related to the rapid adoption of and increased dependency on technology  infrastructure for the provision of financial services and intermediation, as well as the sector’s  growing reliance on technology-based services provided by third parties. The Covid-19 pandemic  has exacerbated these operational risks and increased economic and business uncertainty.  7.  Pandemic-related  disruptions  have  affected  information  systems,  personnel,  facilities  and  relationships  with  third-party  service  providers  and  customers.  In  addition,  cyber  threats  (ransomware attacks, phishing, etc) have spiked, and the potential for operational risk events  caused by people, failed processes and systems has increased as a result of greater reliance on  virtual working arrangements. The Committee’s guidance on operational resilience will continue  to be informed by its monitoring of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and any lessons  learned.   III.  Essential elements of operational resilience  8.  Operational resilience is an outcome that benefits from the effective management of operational  risk.3 Activities  such  as  risk  identification  and  assessment,  risk  mitigation  (including  the  implementation of controls) and ongoing monitoring work together to minimise operational  disruptions and their effects. An operationally resilient bank is less prone to incur untimely lapses  in its operations and losses from disruptions, thus lessening their impact on critical operations  and their related services, functions and systems. While it may not be possible to avoid certain  operational risks, such as a pandemic, it is possible to improve the resilience of a bank’s  operations to such events.   9.  In addition, business continuity,outsourcing of services to third parties and the technology upon  which they rely are important factors for banks to consider when strengthening their operational  resilience. Previously issued guidance in these areas, whether issued solely by the Committee4 5  or jointly with other standard setting bodies (SSBs),6, 7 does not adequately capture all essential    3   See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Consultative Document: Revisions to the principles for sound management of  operational risk, paragraph 5, 2020  4   Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision,  Risk  management  principles  for  electronic  banking,  July  2003,  www.bis.org/publ/bcbs98.pdf.   5   Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Corporate governance principles for banks, July 2015, www.bis.org/publ/bcbs.pdf.  6   The Joint Forum (BCBS, IOSCO, IAIS), Outsourcing in Financial Services, February 2005, www.bis.org/publ/joint12.pdf.  7   The Joint Forum (BCBS, IOSCO, IAIS), High-level principles for business continuity, August 2006, www.bis.org/publ/joint17.pdf.    2  Principles for Operational Resilienceelements when considered on a standalone basis, but does advance operational resilience when  considered collectively.  10.  It is essential for banks to ensure that existing risk management frameworks, business continuity  plans  and  third-party  dependency-management  are  implemented  consistently  within  the  organisation. Internationally active banks should consider whether their operational resilience  efforts are appropriately harmonised with the stated actions, organisational mappings, and  definitions of critical functions and critical shared services contained in their recovery and  resolution plans as specified in the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Recovery and Resolution  Planning framework.8   11.  The principles for operational resilience set forth in this consultative document are largely derived  and adapted from existing guidance that has already been issued by the Committee or national  supervisors over a number of years.9 The Committee recognises that many banks have well- established risk management processes that are appropriate for their individual risk profile,  operational  structure,corporate  governance  and  culture,  and  conform  to  the  specific  risk  management requirements of their jurisdictions. By building upon existing guidance and current  practices, the Committee is proposing a pragmatic, principles-based approach to operational  resilience that will help to ensure proportional implementation across banks of various size,  complexity and geographical location.   IV.   Definition of operational resilience  12.  The Committee defines operational resilience as the ability of a bank to deliver critical operations  through disruption. This ability enables a bank to identify and protect itself from threats and  potential failures, respond and adapt to, as well as recover and learn from disruptive events in  order to minimise their impact on the delivery of critical operations through disruption. In  considering its operational resilience, a bank should take into account its overall risk appetite,  risk capacity and risk profile.10    8   See FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions (October 2014) (http://www.fsb.org/wp- content/uploads/r_141015.pdf), relevant supporting guidance in Identification of Critical Functions and Critical Shared Services  (July 2013)  (http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_130716a.pdf), and Guidance on Arrangements to Support Operational  Continuity in Resolution (August 2016) (https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/Guidance-on-Arrangements-to-Support- Operational-Continuity-in-Resolution1.pdf).   9   See eg Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority, “Building the UK financial sector's operational resilience” (December  2019); The European Commission, Digital Operational Resilience Framework for financial services: Making the EU financial sector  more secure (December 2019); the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Ensuring Safe Management and Operational Resilience of  the Financial Sector (April 2020), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), Principles on  Outsourcing (May 2020).  10   See the Committee’s 2015 Corporate governance guidelines, which leverage the FSB’s 2013 Principles for an effective risk appetite  framework to define “Risk appetite” as the aggregate level and types of risk a bank is willing to assume, decided in advance  and within its risk capacity, to achieve its strategic objectives and business plan; “risk tolerance” to refer to  the variation around  the prescribed risk appetite that the bank is willing to tolerate, and “risk capacity” which is the maximum level of risk the  financial institution can assume given its current level of resources before breaching constraints determined by regulatory  capital and liquidity needs, the operational environment (e.g. technical infrastructure, risk management capabilities, expertise)  and obligations, also from a conduct perspective, to depositors, policyholders, shareholders, fixed income investors, as well as  other customers and stakeholders.  Principles for Operational Resilience  313.  The term critical operations is based on the Joint Forum’s 2006 high-level principles for business  continuity. It encompasses “critical functions” as defined by the FSB11 and is expanded to include,  activities, processes, services and their relevant supporting assets12 the disruption of which would  be material to the continued operation of the bank or its role in the financial system. Whether a  particular operation is “critical” depends on the nature of the bank and its role in the financial  system.   14.  The term respective functions used in this document explicitly refers to the appropriate function(s)  within the bank’s three lines of defence, as described in the PSMOR.13 These consist of: (i)  business unit management; (ii) an independent operational risk management function; and (iii)  independent assurance. Depending on a bank’s nature, such as its size, complexity and risk  profile, how these three lines of defence are implemented may vary.  V.  Operational resilience principles  15.  This section presents the Committee’s principles for operational resilience, which are organised  across the following seven categories: governance; operational risk management; business  continuity planning and testing; mapping of interconnections and interdependencies of critical  operations;  third-party  dependency  management;  incident  management;  and  resilient  information and communication technology (ICT), including cybersecurity.   16.  These categories are based on the Committee’s updated PSMOR, and previously issued principle- based guidance on corporate governance, business continuity, outsourcing and other relevant  risk management frameworks. The practices described below, some of which reflect previously  issued guidance, should not be viewed in isolation, but rather as integral parts of a bank’s  forward-looking operational resilience regime in line with its operational risk appetite, risk  capacity and risk profile.  Governance  Principle 1: Banks should utilise their existing governance structure14 to establish, oversee and implement an  effective operational resilience approach that enables them to respond and adapt to, as well as recover and    11   FSB, Recovery and Resolution Planning for Systemically Important Financial Institutions: Guidance on Identification of Critical  Functions and Critical Shared Services, 2013. According to the FSB, “critical functions” are defined as “activities performed for  third parties where failure would lead to the disruption of services that are vital for the functioning of the real economy and  for financial stability due to the banking group’s size or market share, external and internal interconnectedness, complexity  and cross-border activities. Examples include payments, custody, certain lending and deposit-taking activities in the  commercial or retail sector, clearing and settling, limited segments of wholesale markets, market making in certain securities  and highly concentrated specialist lending sectors.”   12   In this context, supporting assets are defined as people, technology, information, and facilities necessary for the delivery of  critical operations.  13   Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Consultative Document- Revisions to the Principles for the Sound Management of  Operational Risk, paragraph 5, 2020.  14   Consistent with the PSMOR, this document refers to a governance structure composed of a board of directors and senior  management. The Committee is aware that there are significant differences in legislative and regulatory frameworks across  countries regarding the functions of the board of directors and senior management. In some countries, the board has the main,  if not exclusive, function of supervising the executive body (senior management, general management) so as to ensure that    4  Principles for Operational Resiliencelearn from, disruptive events in order to minimise their impact on delivering critical operations through  disruption.  17.  The board of directors should review and approve the bank’s operational resilience expectations  considering the bank’s risk appetite, risk capacity and risk profile. In formulating the bank’s risk  tolerance for disruption to its critical operations, the board of directors should consider a broad  range of severe but plausible scenarios (eg, lockdown due to pandemics, destructive cyber  security incidents, catastrophic natural disasters, etc.).  18.  Under the oversight of the board of directors, senior management should implement the bank’s  operational resilience approach and ensure that financial, technical and other resources are  appropriately allocated in order to support the bank’s overall operational resilience efforts.   19.  Senior management should provide timely reports on the ongoing operational resilience of the  bank’s  business  units  in  support  of  the  board’s  oversight,  particularly  when  significant  deficiencies could affect the delivery of the bank’s critical operations.  20.  The board of directors should take an active role in establishing a broad understanding of the  bank’s operational resilience approach, through clear communication of its objectives to all  relevant parties, including bank personnel, third parties and intra-group entities.  Operational risk management  Principle 2: Banks should leverage their respective functions for the management of operational risk to  identify external and internal threats and potential failures in people, processes and systems on an ongoing  basis, promptly assess the vulnerabilities of critical operations and manage the resulting risks in accordance  with their operational resilience expectations.  21.  The bank’s operational risk management function should work alongside other relevant functions  to manage and address any risks that threaten the delivery of critical operations. For operational  resilience purposes, appropriate coordination with business continuity planning, third-party  dependency management, recovery and resolution planning and other relevant risk management  frameworks may yield greater harmonisation in delivering a consistent approach to operational  resilience across the enterprise.  22.  Banks should have sufficient controls and procedures15 to identify threats and vulnerabilities in a  timely manner and, to the extent possible, prevent these threats from affecting critical operations.  The respective functions should regularly assess the effectiveness of the implemented controls  and procedures. These assessments should also be conducted in the event of changes to any  underlying components of the critical operations, as well as after incidents in order to take into  account lessons learned and new threats and vulnerabilities that caused the incident.  23.  Banks  should  leverage  change  management  capabilities  in  accordance  with  the  change  management processes under the overall management of operational risk as a way to assess    the latter fulfils its tasks. For this reason, in some cases it is known as a supervisory board. This means that the board has no  executive functions. In other countries, the board has a broader competence in that it lays down the general framework for the  management of the bank. Owing to these differences, the terms “board of directors” and “senior management” are used in  this paper not to identify the segregated legal liability in corporate governance practices but rather to label two-tiered decision- making functions within a bank in general.  15   These controls and procedures should be consistent with and conducted alongside the risk identification process as articulated  in Principle 6 in the proposed revisions to the PSMOR.   Principles for Operational Resilience  5potential  effects  on  the  delivery  of  critical  operations  and  on  their  interconnections  and  interdependencies.   Business continuity planning and testing  Principle 3: Banks should have business continuity plans in place and conduct business continuity exercises  under a range of severe but plausible scenarios in order to test their ability to deliver critical operations  through disruption.16  24.  An effective business continuity plan should be forward-looking when assessing the impact of  potential disruptions.Business continuity exercises17 should be conducted and validated for a  range of severe but plausible scenarios that incorporate disruptive events and incidents.  25.  An effective business continuity plan should identify critical operations, key internal and external  dependencies to assess the risks and potential impact of various disruption scenarios on  operations and ensure appropriate resilience levels. These plans should incorporate business  impact analyses, recovery strategies and business continuity plans as well as testing programmes,  training and awareness programmes, and communication and crisis management programmes.   26.  Business continuity plans should develop, implement and maintain a regular business continuity  exercise encompassing critical operations and their interconnections and interdependencies,  including those through relationships with, but not limited to, third parties and intra-group  entities. Among other business continuity goals, business continuity exercises should support  staff’s operational resilience awareness including training of staff, so that they can effectively  adapt and respond to incidents.   27.  Business continuity plans should provide detailed guidance for implementing the bank’s disaster  recovery framework. These plans should establish the roles and responsibilities for managing  operational disruptions and provide clear guidance regarding the succession of authority in the  event of a disruption that impacts key personnel.   28.  Business continuity plans should clearly set out the internal decision-making process and define  the triggers for invoking the bank’s business continuity plan. Internationally active banks should  consider whether their operational resilience efforts are appropriately harmonised with the  bank’s business continuity plans for the delivery of critical operations and critical third-party  services contained in their recovery and resolution plans.  Mapping interconnections and interdependencies  Principle 4: Once a bank has identified its critical operations, the bank should map the relevant internal and  external interconnections and interdependencies to set operational resilience expectations that are necessary  for the delivery of critical operations.   29.  The  respective  functions  should  map  (ie  identify  and  document)  the  people,  technology,  processes, information, facilities, and the interconnections and interdependencies among them  needed to deliver the bank’s critical operations, including those dependent upon, but not limited  to, third parties or intra-group arrangements.     16   Further BCBS guidance on business continuity can be found in documents published through the Joint Forum (BCBS, IOSCO,  IAIS), High-level principles for business continuity, August 2006, www.bis.org/publ/joint17.pdf.  17   The business continuity planning and testing of critical operations should be consistent with and conducted alongside the  business continuity planning articulated in Principle 11 in the proposed revisions to the PSMOR.     6  Principles for Operational Resilience30.  Internationally active banks may leverage their recovery and resolution plans for definitions of  critical  operations  and  should  consider  whether  their  operational  resilience  efforts  are  appropriately harmonised with the organisational mappings of critical operations and critical  third-party services contained in their recovery and resolution plans.   31.  The approach and level of granularity of mapping should be sufficient for banks to identify  vulnerabilities and to support testing of their ability to stay within the bank’s risk tolerance for  disruption considering the bank’s risk appetite, risk capacity and risk profile.   Third-party dependency management  Principle 5: Banks should manage their dependencies on relationships, including those of, but not limited to,  third parties or intra-group entities, for the delivery of critical operations.18  32.  The respective functions should perform a risk assessment and due diligence before entering into  arrangements including those of, but  not limited to, third parties or intra-group entities,  consistent with the bank’s operational risk management framework,19 outsourcing/third-party  risk management policy and operational resilience expectations. Prior to the bank entering into  such an arrangement, the bank should verify whether the third party, including, if relevant, the   intra-group entity to these arrangements has at least equivalent operational resilience conditions  to safeguard the bank’s critical operations.  33.  Banks should formalise their relationships with third parties and intra-group entities through  written agreements which should cover how to maintain operational resilience in both normal  circumstances and in the event of disruption. These written agreements should reflect: the  respective functions’ due diligence; banks’ supervisory and resolution authorities access to third  parties; and the bank’s operational resilience expectations.  34.  Banks should develop appropriate business continuity and contingency planning procedures and  exit strategies to maintain their operational resilience in the event of a failure or disruption at a  third party impacting the provision of critical operations. Scenarios under the bank’s business  continuity plans should assess the substitutability of third parties that provide services to the  bank’s critical operations, and other viable alternatives that may facilitate operational resilience  in the event of an outage at a third party, such as bringing the service back in-house.  Incident management  Principle 6: Banks should develop and implement response and recovery plans to manage incidents20 that  could disrupt the delivery of critical operations in line with the bank’s risk tolerance for disruption considering    18   Further BCBS guidance on outsourcing of services can be found in documents published through the Joint Forum (BCBS,  IOSCO, IAIS), Outsourcing in Financial Services, February 2005, www.bis.org/publ/joint12.pdf.  19   The management of dependencies articulated in this principle should be consistent with and conducted alongside the control  and risk mitigation policies as articulated in paragraph 51 of Principle 9 in the proposed revisions to the PSMOR.   20   Incidents are current or past disruptive events the occurrence of which would have an adverse effect on critical operations of  the bank. Incident management is the process of identifying, analysing, rectifying and learning from an incident and preventing  recurrences or mitigating the severity thereof. The goal of incident management is to limit the disruption and restore critical  operations in line with the bank’s risk tolerance for disruption.  Principles for Operational Resilience  7the bank’s risk appetite, risk capacity and risk profile. Banks should continuously improve their incident  response and recovery plans by incorporating the lessons learned from previous incidents.  35.  Banks should maintain an inventory of incident response and recovery, internal and third-party  resources to support the bank’s response and recovery capabilities.   36.  The scope of incident management should capture the life cycle of an incident,21 typically  including, but not limited to:  a)  the classification of an incident’s severity based on pre-defined criteria (eg expected time to  return to business-as-usual), enabling proper prioritisation of and assignment of resources  to respond to an incident;  b)  the development, maintenance and testing of incident management procedures, including  thresholds for triggering business continuity, disaster recovery and crisis management  procedures; and  c)  the implementation of communication plans to report incidents to both internal and external  stakeholders (eg, regulatory authorities), including performance metrics during, and analysis  of lessons learned after an incident.  37.  Incident response and recovery procedures should be periodically reviewed, tested and updated.  Root causes should be identified and eliminated to prevent the serial recurrence of incidents.   38.  Lessons learned from previous incidents including incidents experienced by others, should be  duly  reflected  when  updating  the  incident  management  programme.  A  bank’s  incident  management programme should manage all incidents impacting the bank, including those  attributable to dependencies on, but not limited to, third parties and intra-group entities.   ICT including cyber security22  Principle 7: Banks should ensure resilient ICT including cyber security that is subject to protection, detection,  response and recovery programmes that are regularly tested, incorporate appropriate situational awareness  and convey relevant information to users on a timely basis in order to fully support and facilitate the delivery  of the bank’s critical operations.23  39.  Banks  should  have  a  documented  ICT  policy,  including  cyber  security,  which  stipulates  governance and oversight requirements, risk ownership and accountability, information security  measures (access controls, critical information asset protection, identity management, etc),  periodic evaluation and monitoring of cyber security controls, and incident response, as well as  business continuity and disaster recovery plans.   40.  Banks should identify their critical information assets and the infrastructure upon which they  depend. Banks should also prioritise their cyber security efforts based on the significance of the  critical information assets to the bank’s critical operations, while observing all pertinent legal and  regulatory requirements relating to data protection and confidentiality. Banks should develop  plans to maintain the integrity of critical information in the event of a cyber event. Banks should    21   Recognising that the life cycle on an incident could span multiple measures of time that could range from hours to weeks to  months.  22   Financial  Stability  Board  Cyberlexicon’s  definition  of  cybersecurity,  November  2018  (https://www.fsb.org/wp- content/uploads/P121118-1.pdf).  23   The management of ICT articulated in this principle should be consistent with and conducted alongside the ICT principle as  articulated in paragraphs 55-57 of Principle 10 in the proposed revisions to the PSMOR.     8  Principles for Operational Resilienceregularly evaluate the threat profile of their critical information assets, test for vulnerabilities and  ensure their resilience to ICT-related risks.  41.  When facilitating the implementation of wide-scale remote-access, rapid deployment of physical  assets and/or significant expansion of bandwidth to support remote user connections and  customer data protection banks should ensure that:  a)  appropriate risk mitigation strategies are developed for potential risks associated with a  disruption or compromise of technology systems and applications. Banks should evaluate  whether the risks, taken together with these strategies, fall within the bank’s risk appetite  and risk tolerance for disruption;   b)  well defined processes for management of remote assets, privileged users and application  development are in place; and  c)  regular updates are made to ICT including cyber security in order to maintain an appropriate  security posture to accommodate remote access as a longer-term option.  VI.  Questions on the proposed principles  42.  The Committee welcomes comments on this document from all stakeholders. More specifically,  regarding  the  operational  resilience  principles,  the  Committee  requests  feedback  on  the  following questions:  Q1. Has the Committee appropriately captured the necessary requirements of an effective operational  resilience approach for banks? Are there any aspects that the Committee could consider further?  Q2. Do you have any comments on the individual principles and supporting commentary?  Q3. Are  there  any  specific  lessons  resulting  from  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  including  relevant  containment measures,that the proposed principles for operational resilience should reflect?  Q4. Do you see merit in further consolidation of the Committee’s relevant principles on operational  risk and resilience?   VII.  Measuring operational resilience  43.  The Committee recognises that measuring a bank’s operational resilience is in a nascent stage  and further work is required to develop a reliable set of metrics that both banks and supervisors  can use to assess whether resilience expectations are being met. The Committee seeks specific  feedback on the following measurement-related question:  Q5. What kind of metrics does your organisation find useful for measuring operational resilience?  What data are used to produce these metrics?     Principles for Operational Resilience  9
