Global imbalances: the perspective of the Bank of England MERVYN KING Governor Bank of England In 2009, demand in the world’s major economies fell, relative to its pre-crisis trend, by around USD 2.5 trillion  or 5 per cent of GDP. The ﬁ nancial crisis damaged virtually every country. Global imbalances helped  to fuel the ﬁ nancial crisis. And today they threaten the sustainability of the recovery in global demand.  Global imbalances are a reﬂ ection of today’s decentralised international monetary and ﬁ nancial system.  All the main players around the world are rationally pursuing their own self interest. But the ﬁ nancial  crisis has revealed that what makes sense for each player individually does not always make sense  in aggregate. These actions had collective consequences. The main lesson from the crisis is the need  to ﬁ nd better ways of ensuring the right collective outcome. Improved ﬁ nancial regulation will help to  intermediate the ﬂ ows associated with global imbalances. But the global economy will remain vulnerable  to the risks associated with imbalances if they are not tackled at source. Two principles should underpin  the way ahead. First, discussions should focus on the underlying disagreement about the right speed of  adjustment to the real pattern of spending and hence the reduction in these imbalances. This discussion  should be informed by countries’ ability to follow that path in a sustainable way. Second, many policies,  in addition to changes in exchange rates, will be needed to reduce imbalances. If agreement is not  reached on these two principles, at best there will be a weak world recovery; at worst, the seeds of the  next ﬁ nancial crisis will be sown.
