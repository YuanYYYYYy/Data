It is a pleasure to meet in Frobisher Hall today. This hall is named after Sir Martin Frobisher, an English  navigator who explored Canada’s eastern arctic coast in the 16th century in search of new trade routes.  His connection to the Barbican is that most of him is buried in the St Giles-in-the-Fields churchyard. (His  heart and entrails are in St Andrew’s Church in Plymouth).  Martin Frobisher is perhaps more famous in Canada than in his native land.  One of the great bays in the  eastern arctic is named after him.  The capital of Nunavut, Iqaluit, lies at the innermost end of Frobisher Bay.   Nine years ago this month Iqaluit hosted the G7 meeting that marked the start of the euro crisis. Events that  still reverberate today including in the environs of the Barbican.  While the debate in the United Kingdom has been understandably dominated by Brexit, the world has been  otherwise engaged.    When the Referendum was being held, the global economy was emerging from a long period of financial  repair and lacklustre growth.  Over the subsequent two years, a widespread and increasingly vigorous global  expansion took hold.  For the first time since the financial crisis, business investment and foreign trade grew  strongly across all major regions.  Economic uncertainty diminished, and consumer and business confidence  firmed.  In economies close to full employment, real wages finally began to grow.  A new beginning seemed possible.  In the past few quarters, however, these trends have largely reversed.  After peaking a year ago around 4%,  global momentum is now weakening in all major regions and downside risks have intensified.  The proportion  of the global economy growing above trend has fallen from four-fifths to one-third.  Trade growth has slowed  and the export outlook has dimmed.  Capital goods orders are stagnating, investment growth has become  more tepid, and business confidence is diminished (Chart 1).

Last year, the returns on all major asset classes from equities to  credit to sovereign debt were negative.  Cash once again was king.

The tightening of financial conditions globally partly reflected the usual – if somewhat delayed – reaction to  the tightening of monetary policy.1  Over the past year, the withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation  gathered pace. The Fed raised interest rates four times, and the Bank of England and ten other G20 central  banks also tightened policy.  In addition, after five years in which there was no new net issuance of G7  government debt, new government borrowing outweighed central bank purchases by more than $1 trillion for  the first time since 2012.   Potentially more seriously, the slowing in global momentum may also be the product of rising trade tensions  and growing policy uncertainty.  Global economic policy uncertainty is at record highs (Chart 3). And  protectionist rhetoric is becoming reality, with the United States raising tariffs on a range of imports from its  main trading partners, and some retaliating in kind (see Annex Table A1).  If all measures contemplated are  implemented, average US tariffs will reach rates not seen in half a century.                                                           1Overall, financial conditions in the US have tightened by around half a standard deviation over the course the current  tightening cycle thus far (Chart 2).  This is a similar cumulative increase as in the 2004-06 tightening cycle, though  somewhat less than in the cycle at the turn of the millennium – a pattern is broadly mirrored across advanced economies  more generally.     3    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  3Chart 3:  Indices of global economic policy uncertainty are at record highs  5 Standard deviations from historical average 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017   Sources:  Bloom et al (2015)2 and Bank calculations  Given the confluence of the current broad-based slowdown and outstanding downside risks, some are  beginning to wonder whether the global expansion, begun in 2010, could be starting to end.    Recessions are notoriously difficult to predict.  The IMF has anticipated only a sixth of the over 300  recessions in member countries since 1991.  Financial markets are more likely to cry wolf, making Paul  Samuelson’s observation fifty years ago that “the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions”  as relevant today as it was then.3  For what it is worth, market-implied probabilities of a recession in the US  are around 20%, nearly three times higher relative to this time a year ago (Chart 4).  There are multiple definitions of what constitutes a global recession.  Some have used a benchmark of global  GDP growth falling below 2½% or 3%, whilst the IMF uses a definition of a fall in global GDP per capita.4  On  the IMF’s definition, there have been four global recessions since WWII:  in 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009.                                                         2See: Baker, S, Bloom, N and Davis, S (2015) Measuring economic policy uncertainty, NBER Working Paper No.21633  3 From Samuelson’s 1966 column ‘Science and Stocks’ in Newsweek.  4This is equivalent to global GDP growth falling below the current rate of population growth of 1%.     4    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  4Chart 4: Market-implied probabilities of a US recession have risen  100 Per cent 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013 2018 NBER recessions Fed recession indicator   Sources: Federal Reserve Board; NBER.

To assess whether recent global developments represent a soft patch or herald renewed stagnation, it is  helpful to consider the position of the global economy with respect to three interrelated cycles: the business  cycle, the financial cycle and the cycle of globalisation.    In each cycle, imbalances can build that hasten their demise, so I will focus on a few of the most important  imbalances to assess global prospects.  The Business Cycle  The business cycle tracks fluctuations in demand about the supply potential of the economy.  In the  expansion phase, growth in output exceeds that of the economy’s supply capacity.  As a result, costs rise  more quickly as companies use resources more intensively, putting upward pressure on inflation.  When  output growth falls below potential, the opposite occurs.  Business cycles have historically lasted up to eight  years on average across advanced economies.5  Recent experience suggests the expansionary phase is  getting longer, and the downturn shorter, partly because of the greater credibility of monetary policy.6                                                          5 In the UK and US, the average duration has been 5 ½ years, based respectively on Hills et al (2010) and the National  Bureau of Economic Research’s business cycle dating committee (http://www.nber.org/cycles.html).    6 See, for example, Miles, D, Panizza,U, Reis, R and Ubide, A (2017) ‘And Yet It Moves.  Inflation and the Great  Moderation’, Geneva Reports on the World Economy 19.        5    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  5Business cycles can be first amplified and then imperilled by growing imbalances in the real economy, such  as over-investment in capital and housing, debt-fuelled consumption, or, particularly in emerging economies,  excess current account imbalances that can lead to sudden stops.7    And imbalances can manifest themselves in rising inflation. In those advanced economies closest to full  employment like the US and the UK, wage pressures have picked up as slack has been absorbed.  A similar  pattern is observable in the euro area (Chart 5).  In the UK, private sector wage growth has increased from  around 1% five years ago, to 2% 3 years ago; 2½% last year to 3 ½ % today as unemployment has fallen  below its natural rate.  Chart 5:  Wage pressures are building in advanced economies as slack is absorbed  3.5 Four-quarterwage growth(per cent) 3.0 UK Darkest values are 2018 2.5 US 2.0 1.5 Euro area 1.0 0.5 Lightest valuesare 2013 0.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 Unemploymentrate (per cent)   Sources: ONS, Eurostat, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Bank Calculations   Notes: The UK wage measure is Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) regular pay, the US wage measure is Employment  Cost Index (ECI) wages \u0026 salaries, and the EA wage measure is compensation per employee. Data frequency is  quarterly.     The recent Anglo Saxon experience suggests the wage Phillips Curve is alive and well, if not particularly  steeply sloped.  The pick-up of wages is slowly feeding through to core inflation, which is now close to 2% in  both the US and UK.   Globally, inflation has moderated as commodity prices have fallen back, consistent with the slower pace of  global growth, and some evidence of slack emerging in a range of economies.                                                         7 Such imbalances can themselves build up in an over-reaction to deeper phenomena such as an increase in total factor  productivity growth or a temporary surge in growth in the workforce resulting from technological change.  Such  development can result in over-investment if firms and households are overoptimistic about their duration.      6    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  6Financial markets now expect more accommodative than previously monetary policies in all major economic  areas (Chart 6), and in China, the PBOC has taken a number of measures to provide stimulus.8    Chart 6:  Financial markets expect more accommodative monetary policy than they did in 2018  Per cent 3.5 Solid lines: February 2019 Inflation Report Dashed lines: November 2018 Inflation Report 3.0 UnitedStates 2.5 2.0 Federal funds rate United Kingdom 1.5 Bank Rate 1.0 Euro area 0.5 0.0 -0.5 ECB deposit rate ECB main refinancing rate -1.0 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022   Sources:  Bank of England, Bloomberg Finance L.P., ECB, Federal Reserve, Eikon from Refinitiv and Bank calculations.  Provided the expansion continues, a modest tightening of monetary policy over time will likely be sufficient to  achieve inflation targets.  Policy can remain limited and gradual, as well as data dependent.   Both these guides to monetary policy reflect the historically low level of the equilibrium interest rate, or r*.9   As the Bank of England has long emphasised, a number of forces have depressed r* 10 – a view that has  been validated by muted inflation over the past five years, despite a long period of historically low interest  rates.11  As the Federal Reserve has observed, incoming data will provide important information about the  evolution of the equilibrium rate.12                                                           8 The PBOC have introduced several easing measures since April 2018 including cuts to the reserve requirement ratio,  relaxing capital requirements for banks, and introducing credit support for private businesses.  9The equilibrium interest rate is the level of the real policy rate that, if allowed to prevail for several years, would place  economic activity at its potential and keep inflation low and stable.   10A set of profound forces in the world economy, both secular and cyclical, has pushed down on the level of world real  interest rates over the past 30 years by as much as 450 basis points - see Carney, M (2013), ‘The spirit of the season’  and Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), ‘Secular drivers of the global real interest rate’, Bank of England Working Paper No.  571). The global equilibrium interest rate is likely to rise in coming years as some of the shorter-term factors pushing it  down ease. For example, the process of private sector balance sheet repair is nearing an end and the global stance of  fiscal policy is shifting from contractionary to expansionary.  Any rise in potential productivity growth would also boost the  equilibrium rate.  The scope for the equilibrium rate to rise will also be greater if spare capacity is larger than currently  estimated.  11See Carney, M (2018), ‘Guidance, Contingencies and Brexit’. 12 For example, as explained by Richard Clarida in his speech ‘Data Dependence and US Monetary Policy’, 27  November 2018.       7    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  7In the MPC’s projections published last week, the balance of headwinds to growth and more accommodative  policies are expected to return global growth to around potential rates by the end of the year (Table 1).

Notes: 2018-21 figures show annual average growth rates. Potential growth is calculated as an average from 2019-2021.  This is the most likely scenario unless there are shocks from the other two cycles.  The Financial Cycle   The global financial crisis was a painful reminder that the business cycle is not the only source of  imbalances.  Indeed, imbalances at the heart of the financial cycle have been the best predictors of  downturns in recent decades.  The financial cycle tracks the rise and fall in leverage and financial conditions around their sustainable levels.   Compared to the business cycle, the financial cycle is greater in amplitude, slower moving and longer lasting,  sometimes taking up to 20 years between peaks.    As an economy expands, risk taking increases and lending constraints are relaxed.  Debt and asset prices  rise, reinforcing each other. Towards the top of the cycle balance sheets appear strong but are increasingly  fragile.  Equity and asset valuations are flattered by mark-to-market profits.  Debt sustainability is vulnerable  to shocks.    At the very top irrationality sets in.  Current conditions are assumed to continue forever.  “House prices can  only go up.”  “Financial innovation reduces risk.”  “Markets always clear.”  People fall for the old lies and  unknowingly take great risks secure in the belief that this time is different.   To find a silver lining in the storm clouds of the financial crisis, there has been an explosion of work into how  best to track the financial cycle and avoid its damaging extremes.      8    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  8A range of indicators are now monitored routinely by bodies, such as the Financial Policy Committee (FPC),  tasked with maintaining financial stability.  And many countries, including the UK, now have a range of  macro-prudential tools to cut excesses off at source, before they affect wider economic prospects.   On the surface, global debt burdens are alarming. The outstanding stock of debt has almost doubled since  the crisis. Public debt burdens across advanced economies have risen above 90% of GDP for the first time  since WWII.  Public sector debt is important for intergenerational equity, and high levels of public  indebtedness tend to result in lower growth over the long run.13  But history suggests that high public debt is  generally a chronic not an acute problem.  Provided fiscal frameworks remain credible, public debt tends to  be less informative for predicting recessions.  Research at the Bank of England and elsewhere finds that private sector credit growth is amongst the best  early warning indicators of a downturn.14  Over half of recessions are preceded by private sector credit  booms.  And within advanced economies, two-thirds of private credit booms have also ended in recessions.15   As borrowers take on more debt and devote a greater share of cash flows to servicing it, they become more  vulnerable to shocks.  And there will always be shocks. Debt may not be the proximate cause of the crisis,  but it can be the vulnerability that turns shock into slump.  At present, aggregate private financial imbalances in advanced economies do not appear large enough, on  their own, to tip global activity from slowing to stalling.  Private sector credit growth has averaged less than  3% in the UK, US and the euro area over the past decade, generally less than nominal GDP growth.   Aggregate debt servicing ratios are below historic averages, in part due to low equilibrium interest rates.  Although there are pockets of risk, heat maps that mechanically bring together several credit measures  remain relatively cool overall (Chart 7) – though aggregates can hide important pockets of risk that can  amplify negative shocks, and, as I’ll discuss, it is a different picture for China.                                                         13See Reinhart, C, Rogoff, K, (2010), Growth in a Time of Debt, American Economic Review. 14 For example, see Bridges, J, Jackson, C, McGregor, D (2017) Down in the slumps: the role of credit in five decades of  recessions, Bank of England Staff Working Paper N. 659; Borio, C, Drehmann, M, Xia, D (2018) The financial cycle and  recession risk, BIS quarterly review; Taylor, A, Schularick, M (2012) Credit Booms Gone Bust: Monetary Policy,  Leverage Cycles, and Financial Crises, 1870-2008, American Economic Review;  Aikman, D, Bridges, J, Kashyap, A,  Siegart, C (2018) Would macroprudential regulation have prevented the last crisis?, Bank of England Staff Working  Paper N. 747.  15There are various definitions of a credit boom in the empirical literature – for a brief summary see Gorton, G, Ordoñez,  G (2019), Good Booms, Bad Booms, forthcoming in the Journal of the European Economic Association. The share of  recessions preceded by credit booms is fairly stable at around 55% under several definitions, for both advanced  economies and emerging markets. The share of credit booms which end in a recession varies from half to two-thirds.      9    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  9Chart 7:  Heat-map of credit indicators are relatively cool    Sources:  Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and Bank calculations.

Red values indicate readings in excess of the 80th percentile; dark blues indicate  readings below the 20th percentile; green values are close to the median.   Digging a little deeper, household balance sheets have generally improved.  Whereas in the lead-up to the  global financial crisis, household debt in the US, UK and major euro-area economies16 rose by almost 40  percentage points relative to income, since then households have delevered by an average of 11 percentage  points.17  UK households have gone further, de-levering by about 20 per cent of income.  The share of highly  indebted UK households has fallen to 1% from a pre-crisis peak of almost 3%.  It would take a rise in interest  rates of 300bps to bring this share back up to its historical average.18     Corporate debt is more of a concern, particularly in the US.   Like households, companies repaired their balance sheets following the crisis but unlike households,  corporates then went back to the well.  Relative to earnings, aggregate corporate debt in the US and UK is                                                         16 Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.  17Household credit growth has been subdued, rising at an annual rate of less than 5% in each of the UK, US and euro  area for the past decade, compared to rates of over 12% in the US and UK pre-crisis. 18Highly indebted households are defined as those with debt servicing ratios of more than 40%.     10    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  10nearing pre-crisis peaks,19 and the distribution is worsening. In the UK, the share of highly levered  companies is above pre-crisis levels. This is despite the very modest growth in investment.  Globally, the average quality of corporate borrowers has deteriorated materially.  The share of lower-rated  debt in global corporate bond markets has increased significantly over the last 10 years, with BBB-rated  bonds now about half of the market compared to just a quarter in 2007.    The global leveraged lending market grew by 21% in 2018, faster than the rate of growth in US subprime  mortgages in the run up to the crisis.  At $2.3 trillion, the stock of outstanding leveraged loans is double that  of subprime in 2007. Leverage of the most indebted issuers has been increasing rapidly (Chart 8).  60% of leveraged loans are now covenant-light and most deals have substantial “add backs” of EBITDA.20   These are developments analogous to the “No Doc / No Income” heyday of US subprime.  To add to the sense of déjà vu, growth in leveraged loans has been increasingly driven by securitisation.

Notes: The chart includes leveraged loans issued to US corporate borrowers. Total debt to EBITDA is measured post- issuance and is not adjusted for EBITDA add-backs, which have increased in size and prevalence in recent years.  There are some important differences between leveraged lending today and subprime a decade ago. Non- banks are playing much smaller roles in origination, and ‘skin-in-the-game’ rules had, until recently, aligned                                                         19In the US, gross corporate debt as a share of annual earnings was 266% in Q3 2018, compared to 262% at the end of  2007.  On the same measure UK corporate debt to earnings was 312% in Q3 2018 compared to 336% at the end of the  2007, but excluding the leverage of UK companies in the CRE sector it is above pre-crisis levels (301% in Q3 2018 vs  278% at end-2007). See the Bank of England’s November 2018 Financial Stability Report for more details. 20This compares to the 40% of US mortgages that were issued without full documentation of borrowers’ income in 2006.     11    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  11incentives between originators and holders.  It is regrettable that this requirement has been rolled back in the  US, where 85% of Collateralised Loan Obligations (CLOs) are originated.21  Most fundamentally, the main holders of leveraged loans can generally bear the risks.  There is no analogue  to the thinly capitalised Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) who issued short-term commercial paper to  hold long-term illiquid sub-prime debt in the run up to the crisis. For CLOs, the riskiest tranches are  concentrated in hedge funds, open-ended funds, structured credit funds and CLO managers (Chart 9).  US  banks and insurers own around one third of CLOs (usually the less risky tranches) compared to only 6% for  European firms and 2% for UK firms.

For further detail, see footnotes to Chart F. 8 in the November 2018 Financial Stability Report.  This specific point highlights the more general progress that has been made improving the resilience of the  core of the financial sector. Banks in most regions are now more likely to be stabilisers rather than amplifiers  of shocks.   Regulation has made banks less complex and more focused.  They lend more to the real economy and less  to each other.  Trading assets have been cut in half, and interbank lending is down by one-third.    And their resilience in most jurisdictions has been transformed. For example, UK banks have CET1 ratios of  about 15%, more than three times their pre-crisis level.  Their aggregate MREL is 26%.  They hold £1 trillion                                                         21Based on all widely traded CLOs in the US and Europe.      12    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  12of high quality liquid assets, a four-fold increase over the past decade.  And their short-term wholesale  funding has fallen from 15% to 4% of balance sheets.  There is also greater supervisory scrutiny, not least through stringent stress tests.  Indeed, in the past few  years, major UK banks have been tested against all the major risks I will cover today (from China to inflation  scares plus a few others for good measure).  The Story Thus Far  While there are pockets of risk and global growth is still decelerating, the combination of the policy response  and the state of the current imbalances in advanced economies suggest that global growth is more likely  than not to stabilise eventually around its new, modest trend.    But this is a judgement, not a guarantee. The world is in a delicate equilibrium.  Productivity is weak  everywhere.  The sustainability of debt burdens depends on interest rates remaining low and global trade  remaining open.  And business and consumer confidence are being buffeted by extreme policy uncertainty.  Indeed, there are at least three important risks on the horizon.  First, financial risks will intensify if complacency sets in.  Paradoxically a prolongation of the expansion  could make its demise both more likely and more painful.      The frequency of financial crises over history is partly because memories fade, financial lobbies are powerful,  and the costs of backsliding on financial reform are invisible, at first.   When it comes to financial stability, success is an orphan.  G20 countries bear heavy responsibilities to safeguard the progress since the crisis through disciplined  implementation of agreed reforms.  And policymakers must remain vigilant and address new risks as they  arise.   The lessons of subprime bear recalling.  Subprime mortgages emerged in the mid-1990s as an innovation to  expand home ownership to those who had been unfairly excluded.  But they eventually grew unchecked until  subprime mortgages written in 2006 and 2007 were twice as likely to default as those originated just a few  years earlier.  It is just such a descent from responsible to reckless underwriting that we must avoid today. That’s why the  FPC has acted to limit the share of high loan-to-income mortgages UK banks can originate, the PRA has  tightened standards on consumer credit and the Bank is monitoring closely the growth in leveraged lending.       13    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  13The second reason for caution is the possibility of a more material slowdown in China.   China is the one major economy in which all major financial imbalances have materially worsened.  It may be  the exception that proves the rule that financial imbalances cause recessions.   While China’s economic miracle over the past three decades has been extraordinary, its post-crisis  performance has relied increasingly on one of the largest and longest running credit booms ever, with an  associated explosion of shadow banking.    Total Social Financing has increased from 120% to 223% of GDP since 2008. In parallel, the non-bank  financial sector has increased from around 20% of GDP to over 70% today, with developments echoing  those in the pre-crisis US including off-balance sheet vehicles with large maturity mismatches, sharp  increases in repo financing, and large contingent liabilities of both borrowers and banks.   Chinese authorities have begun taking measures to manage these risks.  Growth in Total Social Financing is  now in line with that of nominal GDP (Chart 10).  The shadow banking sector is being restructured.  But  there is a tension between reducing the risks from high debt and supporting the economy.

A downturn in the Chinese economy would test the resilience elsewhere.  China’s contribution to global  growth has risen from one-fifth to one-third since the last US tightening cycle. 22                                                           22Reflecting the increased importance for China to the global economy, the scenario used in the FPC’s annual stress  tests of the major UK banks includes a significant slowdown in the Chinese economy.      14    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  14To give a sense of the issue, in the 21 credit booms that matched the scale of China’s since 1975, annual  growth dropped by 3¼ percentage points on average in the subsequent years.  Adjusting for progress thus  far and China’s degree of development, this suggests growth could slow a further 1 to 1½ percentage points.    Of course, deeper trade tensions would worsen the slowdown.   The Bank of England estimates that a 3% drop in Chinese GDP would knock one per cent off global activity,  including half a per cent off each of UK, US and euro area GDP, through trade, commodities and financial  market channels.  A harder landing would have significantly larger effects, as these channels would likely be  accompanied by negative spillovers to global confidence.    The final caution concerns the future of globalisation.   Trade tensions abroad and Brexit debates at home are manifestations of fundamental pressures to reorder  globalisation.  It is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient  global economy.  At the same time, there is a risk that countries turn inwards, undercutting growth and  prosperity for all.  Concerns over this possibility are already impairing investment, jobs and growth, creating a  dynamic that could become self-fulfilling.  While the current cycle of globalisation has brought widespread prosperity—lifting a billion people out of  poverty and raising output per capita up 40% in both the UK and globally since the mid-1990s—it has also  given rise to three imbalances that threaten its sustainability.  First, external imbalances, with large trade surpluses emerging in some regions and big deficits in others.   Though somewhat smaller than on the eve of the crisis, the sum of current account surpluses remains  significant at 2% of global GDP.  The sustainability of these imbalances is made more challenging by the asymmetry at the heart of the  international monetary system.  As the world economy has been reordered with the weight of emerging  market economies rising from 40% to 60% of activity in the past quarter century, the US dollar is as dominant  today as it ever was.23  This contributes economically to higher risks of sudden stops and politically to greater  mercantilist pressures.  Second, globalisation has contributed to higher imbalances of income and wealth in many countries.24   Amongst economists, a belief in free trade is totemic, but while trade makes countries better off, it does not  raise all boats within them.                                                            23For example, two-thirds of official foreign currency reserves are in US dollars, over 60% of countries use the US dollar  as their anchor currency, and around half of international trade is invoiced in US dollars - far greater than the US’s 10%  share of world trade.  24The IMF finds that technological progress during the 3rd Industrial Revolution has been the biggest contributor to these  increasing imbalances. See IMF (2017), Understanding the Downward Trend in Labour Income Shares, April World  Economic Outlook, Chapter 3.       15    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  15Rather, the benefits from trade are unequally spread across individuals and time. Consumers get lower  prices and new products, and further benefits from higher productivity over time. Some workers, however,  lose their jobs and the dignity of work, or see their “factor prices equalised.”  In plain English, their wages fall.   Such dynamics are being felt by those at either end of the great convergence. Survey evidence shows that  70% of Chinese workers believe that trade creates jobs and increases wages, US households think the  opposite, and UK public opinion is equivocal.25  The nascent fourth industrial revolution may (for a time)  harden such concerns.   And third, globalisation leads to imbalances of democracy and sovereignty, leading many to lament a loss of  control and to lose trust in the system. As Dani Rodrik has argued, there is a trilemma between economic  integration, democracy and sovereignty. 26  Common rules and standards are required for trade in goods,  services and capital, but those rules cede or, at best pool, sovereignty.  To maintain legitimacy, the process  of agreeing those standards needs to be rooted in democratic accountability.    Much will be required to create a more inclusive, sustainable globalisation but part of the solution is a more  flexible and open trading system for services and for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  Freer trade in services can help to resolve external imbalances.27  With barriers to services trade currently up  to three times higher than those for goods, the Bank estimates that eliminating this differential could reduce  the excess deficits of the US by up to one third and of the UK by up to one half.  Freer trade for SMEs and services would spread the benefits of global markets much more widely than  traditional, more multinational-based free trade in goods.   SMEs employ 60% of workers.  More women work  in services than men. The digital revolution28 could help to ensure trade is available to the smallest  companies as well as the largest.  And freer trade in services could help rebalance the trilemma from prescriptive supranational rules to more  differentiated, national approaches to achieve common outcomes.    The post-crisis reforms of financial services offer a model.  The G20 has agreed a wide range of regulatory  standards and put in place the mechanisms for deep supervisory cooperation.  These Financial Stability  Board (FSB) reforms create a platform for cross border financial services between different legal systems  and regulatory approaches that achieve similar outcomes for financial stability. This avoids unnecessary                                                         25See Carney, M (2016), ‘The Spectre of Monetarism’. 26Rodrik, D. (2011).

Intangible capital is now  more important than physical capital. A hyper-connected, capital-light world, could offers a future that increasingly  belongs to small and medium-sized firms, with platforms (such as taskrabbit, Amazon, Etsy, Shopify, and SamaHub)  giving them direct stakes in local and global markets.       16    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  16duplication and costly fragmentation while promoting greater competition, enhanced resilience and improved  efficiency to the benefit of all our citizens.  Conclusion: Is this How the Expansion Ends?    Although the economic and financial imbalances in the global economy do not yet appear to contain the  seeds of their own demise, global momentum is softening.    Monetary policymakers may need to be disciplined and macroprudential authorities, vigilant.  Risks from China and from de-globalisation are significant and growing.  Could they be how the expansion  ends?  Protectionism appears already to be having an impact.  Last year trade growth lagged the growth of global  activity, and current global export PMIs now signal a contraction in global trade (Chart 11).    Chart 11: Trade growth has weakened notably   DiffusionIndex, 50 = no change Percentagechange on a year ago 56 7 55 6 CPB world trade volume  54 (3 month MA, RHS) 5 Global manufacturing PMI:  53 New export orders (6 month lead, LHS) 4 52 3 51 2 50 1 49 0 48 47 -1 46 -2 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019   Sources: CPB,Markit Economics and Bank calculations.   Bank of England simulations suggest that the impact through direct trade channels of the narrow, bilateral  tariffs already announced would tend to be small and would be largely confined to the countries directly  involved.   A larger increase in tariffs of 10 percentage points between the US and all of its trading partners could take  2½ per cent off US output and 1 per cent off global output through trade channels alone, although the impact  on the UK is smaller reflecting a greater exchange-rate driven boost to net exports. If business confidence  and financial conditions are also affected (as recent experience suggests they would be), these impacts  could double (Table 2).        17    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  17Table 2: GDP losses from a 10 percentage point increase in tariffs on US trade would be substantial29   GDP impact (peak impact over three  US  UK  EA  World (PPP)  year period, %)  Trade war  - 2½  -½  -1  -1¼  Tighter financial conditions  -1  -1  -¾  -½  Greater uncertainty  -½  -¼  -¼  -¼  Permanent tariffs  -¾  0  -½  -½  Total  -5  -1¾   -2¼  - 2½  Notes:  Bank calculations.  There are signs that concerns about such possibilities are beginning to cascade through economies via  reduced investment and demand.    Consider the UK as a leading indicator of a nascent global trend. UK business investment has fallen 3.7%  over the past year despite the ongoing expansion, high business profitability and accommodative financial  conditions. With fundamental uncertainty about future market access, UK investment hasn’t grown since the  referendum was called and has dramatically underperformed both history and peers (Charts 12 and 13).

Similarly, a prolongation of global trade uncertainty could undermine the global expansion.  The impact  would be magnified if financial markets move such a possibility from their tail risks towards their central  scenarios.30                                                         29Based on simulations using NiGEM. The baseline scenario assumes a 10 percentage point increase in tariffs that  persists for three years. The additional impact from tighter financial conditions is based on a 75bp increase in term  premia and 50bp increase in equity risk premia globally; and the uncertainty impact is proxied by assuming agents  anticipate a further 10pp increase in tariffs the following year. Global monetary policy is held fixed for five years.      18    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  18Most fundamentally, the larger and the more permanent the disruption to global trade—the greater the de- globalisation—the greater the reduction in both activity and supply capacity of economies.  The latter—a  material hit to supply—is something that advanced economies have not experienced since the mid-1970s.  In this scenario, the combination of slower growth, smaller surpluses in Asia and higher risk premia could  move global interest rates higher, increasing the burden of corporate and household debts and challenging  the creditworthiness of some sovereigns.  Contrary to what you might have heard, it isn’t easy to win a trade war.  If the UK has been somewhat more inwardly focused of late, it has been for good reason.   In many respects, Brexit is the first test of a new global order and could prove the acid test of whether a way  can be found to broaden the benefits of openness while enhancing democratic accountability. Brexit can lead  to a new form of international cooperation and cross-border commerce built on a better balance of local and  supranational authorities. In these respects, Brexit could affect both the short and long-term global outlooks.  It is in the interests of everyone, arguably everywhere – from Frobisher’s grave to Frobisher’s Bay - that a  Brexit solution that works for all is found in the weeks ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                             30While economic, policy and geopolitical uncertainties are very high, several market-based risk metrics are not. Credit  spreads, the VIX and equity implied volatilities are below the 50th percentile of their historic distributions, as is equity risk  premium in the US. Despite recent volatility, high-yield corporate bond spreads also remain below pre-crisis averages.     19    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches  19ANNEX    Table A1:  Weighted average bilateral tariffs   Tariffs imposed by:  US  China  US  EU  On imports from:  China  the US   the EU  the US  Prior to recent escalation  2.6  9.1  3.3  3.0  Current measures(a)  8.4  17.8  3.7  3.3  With contemplated measures(b)  13.7  22.4  6.7  7.7  (a)  US tariffs on steel and aluminium, the reciprocated tariffs of 25% on $50bn of US imports from China, and 10% tariffs  on an additional $200bn of US imports from China, matched by 10% tariffs on $60bn US exports to China.

The MPCs overall assessment of the outlook for inflation and activity in the August Inflation Report is broadly similar to that in May.   In the MPCs central forecast, GDP growth remains sluggish in the near term as the squeeze on households real incomes continues to weigh on consumption.   Growth then picks up to just above its reduced potential rate over the balance of the forecast period.   Net trade and business investment firm up, and consumption growth recovers in line with modestly rising household incomes.   Net trade is bolstered by strong global growth and the past depreciation of sterling.   The combination of high rates of profitability, especially in the export sector, the low cost of capital and limited spare capacity supports investment by UK firms over the forecast period, offsetting the effect of continued uncertainties around Brexit. CPI inflation rose to 2.6% in June from 2.3% in March, as expected.   The MPC expects inflation to rise further in coming months and to peak around 3% in October, as the past depreciation of sterling continues to pass through to consumer prices.   Conditional on the current market yield curve, inflation is projected to remain above the MPCs target throughout the forecast period.   This overshoot reflects entirely the effects of the referendum-related falls in sterling.   As the effect of rising import prices on inflation diminishes, domestic inflationary pressures gradually pick up over the forecast period.   As slack is absorbed, wage growth is projected to recover.   In addition, margins in the consumer sector, having been squeezed by the pickup in import prices, are projected to be rebuilt.   Consequently, inflation remains at a level slightly above the 2% target.   As in previous Reports, the MPCs projections are conditioned on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdoms eventual trading relationship with the European Union.   The projections also assume that, in the interim, households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading relationship.   Other important judgements include:   that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices broadly as projected, and without adverse consequences for inflation expectations further ahead;   that regular pay growth remains modest in the near term but picks up over the forecast period;   and that subdued household spending growth is largely balanced by a pickup in other components of demand.   Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years.   Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth.   For this reason, the MPCs remit specifies that, in exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity.   Through most of the forecast period, the economy operates with a small degree of spare capacity and CPI inflation is well above the target.   By the end of the forecast, that trade-off is eliminated.   Spare capacity is fully absorbed, and inflation remains above the target. The Committee judges that, given the assumptions underlying its projections including the closure of the drawdown period of the TFS, and allowing for the effects of the recent prudential decisions of the Financial Policy Committee and the Prudential Regulation Authority, some tightening of monetary policy would be required to achieve a sustainable return of inflation to the target.   Specifically, if the economy follows a path broadly consistent with the August central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than the path implied by the yield curve underlying the August projections.   In light of these considerations, six members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the demands of the MPCs remit.   Two members considered it appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points.   All members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.   The Committee will continue to monitor closely the incoming evidence, and stands ready to respond to changes in the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.

The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The MPCs updated projections for inflation and activity are set out in the November Inflation Report. In the Committees central projection, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by market yields and on a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdoms eventual trading relationship with the European Union, GDP is expected to grow by around 1 ¾% per year on average over the forecast period. Momentum in household consumption appears greater than previously expected, supported by the strong labour market and resilient household confidence. Over the forecast period, household consumption is expected to grow modestly relative to historical rates, broadly in line with real incomes. In contrast, business investment has been more subdued than previously anticipated, as the effect of Brexit uncertainty has intensified. Under the smooth transition assumption on which the forecast is conditioned, greater clarity is expected to emerge over the coming months, boosting investment growth. The MPCs projections were finalised before the Budget measures had been announced and the Committee will assess the implications at its next meeting. The global economy continues to grow at above potential rates, supporting UK net trade. Growth has softened, however, and become more uneven across countries, and downside risks have risen. Global financial conditions have tightened, particularly in emerging market economies, and activity has slowed in the euro area.   Trade restrictions have increased and there is a risk of further escalation. The MPC judges that aggregate supply and demand are now broadly in balance. The labour market remains tight, with the employment rate and vacancies around record highs, and the unemployment rate at its lowest since the mid-1970s. Regular pay growth has been stronger than expected, rising to over 3%.   Although modest by historical standards, the projected pace of UK GDP growth is slightly faster than the diminished rate of supply growth, which averages around 1 ½% per year. A margin of excess demand is therefore expected to build, feeding through into higher growth in domestic costs. The contribution of external cost pressures, which has accounted for above-target inflation since the beginning of 2017, is projected to ease over the forecast period. Taking these influences together, CPI inflation is projected to remain above the target for most of the forecast period, before reaching 2% by the end of the third year. The economic outlook will depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular the form of new trading arrangements, the smoothness of the transition to them and the responses of households, businesses and financial markets. The implications for the appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The MPC judges that the monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. At this meeting the MPC judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. The Committee also judges that, were the economy to continue to develop broadly in line with the November Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon. Any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. Monetary policy summary and minutes Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20191107\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 6 November 2019, the MPC voted by a majority of 7-2 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The Committees new projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying November Monetary Policy Report. They are now based on the assumption of an orderly transition to a deep free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Looking through Brexit-related volatility, underlying UK GDP growth has slowed materially this year and a small margin of excess supply has opened up. That slowdown reflects weaker global growth, driven by trade protectionism, and the domestic impact of Brexit-related uncertainties. In October, the UK and EU agreed a Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration as well as a flexible extension of Article 50. As a consequence, the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has fallen markedly and the sterling exchange rate has appreciated. These agreements are expected to remove some of the uncertainty facing businesses and households, and the MPC projects that UK GDP growth will pick up during 2020. This will be further supported by easier UK fiscal policy and a modest recovery in global growth. Over the remainder of the forecast period, demand growth is expected to outstrip the subdued pace of supply growth, which is restrained to some extent by the adjustment to new trading arrangements with the EU. Inflationary pressures are projected to lessen in the near term. CPI inflation remained at 1.7% in September and is expected to decline to around 1 ¼% by the spring, owing to the temporary effect of falls in regulated energy and water prices. While unit labour costs have been growing at rates above those consistent with meeting the inflation target and core services CPI inflation has begun to increase somewhat, employment growth has slowed and pay growth is likely to fall back in the near term. In the second half of the MPCs forecast period, however, as a significant margin of excess demand emerges, domestic inflationary pressures are expected to build. Conditioned on current market yields, CPI inflation is projected to rise to slightly above 2% towards the end of the forecast period. Monetary policy could respond in either direction to changes in the economic outlook in order to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.   The Committee will, among other factors, monitor closely the responses of companies and households to Brexit developments as well as the prospects for a recovery in global growth. If global growth fails to stabilise or if Brexit uncertainties remain entrenched, monetary policy may need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation.   Further ahead, provided these risks do not materialise and the economy recovers broadly in line with the MPCs latest projections, some modest tightening of policy, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, may be needed to maintain inflation sustainably at the target. The MPC judges at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Monetary policy summary and minutes Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20210624\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.   At its meeting ending on 22 June 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.   The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%.   The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion.   The Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at  £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at  £895 billion.  In the MPCs central projection in the May Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP was expected to recover strongly over 2021, to pre-Covid-19 (Covid) levels.   Spare capacity in the economy was expected to be eliminated as activity picked up, and there was expected to be a temporary period of excess demand, before demand and supply returned broadly to balance.   CPI inflation was projected to rise temporarily above the 2% target, owing mainly to developments in energy prices.   As these transitory effects faded, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, inflation was expected to return to around 2% in the medium term. Since May, developments in global GDP growth have been somewhat stronger than anticipated, particularly in advanced economies.   Global price pressures have picked up further, reflecting strong demand for goods, rising commodity prices, supply-side constraints and transportation bottlenecks, and these have started to become apparent in consumer price inflation in some advanced economies.   Financial market measures of inflation expectations suggest that the near-term strength in inflation is expected to be transitory. Bank staff have revised up their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q2 by around 1 ½% since the May Report, as restrictions on economic activity have eased, so that output in June is expected to be around 2 ½% below its pre-Covid 2019 Q4 level.   This recovery in activity has been most pronounced in the consumer-facing services for which restrictions were loosened in April.   Output in a number of sectors is now around pre-Covid levels, although it remains materially below in others.   The housing market remains strong, and indicators of consumer confidence have increased.   The direct economic implications of the delays in the final stages of the relaxation of Covid restrictions are likely to be relatively small compared with the impact of previous stages.     The LFS unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.7% in the three months to April, although it is likely that labour market slack has remained higher than implied by this measure.   Some individuals stopped looking for work during the pandemic, and were therefore recorded as inactive.   There is uncertainty around how many of these individuals will resume their search for a job, and when.   The number of furloughed jobs has declined faster than expected, as demand has recovered.   Overall, there is judged to be spare capacity in aggregate in the economy at present.   However, vacancies have risen above pre-Covid levels, and there are increasing signs of recruitment difficulties for some businesses, and in some locations and sectors.    Private sector regular pay in the three months to April was 5.6% higher than a year earlier.   Measured pay growth continues to be boosted by compositional effects, given that job losses have been skewed towards lower-paid employees during the pandemic.   In addition, the base effect of the drop in pay in spring and summer 2020 will continue to distort the annual comparison, such that, even if the level of private sector regular pay were to remain unchanged in May and June, twelve-month pay growth would still rise to close to 8% in the second quarter.   Underlying pay growth appears to be around pre-Covid rates.    Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 1.5% in April to 2.1% in May, above the MPCs 2% target and 0.3 percentage points higher than expected in the May Report.   Core CPI inflation has also risen from 1.3% to 2.0%.   Building global input cost pressures have increasingly been passed through into manufacturing output prices and non-oil import prices.   CPI inflation is expected to pick up further above the target, owing primarily to developments in energy and other commodity prices, and is likely to exceed 3% for a temporary period.    The Committees expectation is that the direct impact of rises in commodity prices on CPI inflation will be transitory.   More generally, the Committees central expectation is that the economy will experience a temporary period of strong GDP growth and above-target CPI inflation, after which growth and inflation will fall back.   There are two-sided risks around this central path, and it is possible that near-term upward pressure on prices could prove somewhat larger than expected.   Taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judges that UK inflation expectations remain well anchored. In judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will, consistent with its policy guidance and as always, focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including the balance between demand and supply, and medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that are likely to be transient.    The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely and will take whatever action is necessary to achieve its remit.   The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably.    The Committee will have the opportunity to assess the economic outlook more fully in the context of its August Monetary Policy Report and accompanying economic projections.    At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. \n","20160714\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 13 July 2016, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%, with one member voting for a cut in Bank Rate to 0.25%.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion.  Committee members made initial assessments of the impact of the vote to leave the European Union on demand, supply and the exchange rate.  In the absence of a further worsening in the trade-off between supporting growth and returning inflation to target on a sustainable basis, most members of the Committee expect monetary policy to be loosened in August.  The precise size and nature of any stimulatory measures will be determined during the August forecast and Inflation Report round. Financial markets have reacted sharply to the United Kingdoms vote to leave the European Union.  Since the Committees previous meeting, the sterling effective exchange rate has fallen by 6%, and short-term and longer-term interest rates have declined.  Reflecting the fall in the level of sterling, financial market measures of inflation expectations have risen moderately at short-term horizons, but only to around historical averages, and have fallen slightly at longer horizons.  Markets have functioned well, and the improved resilience of the core of the UK financial system and the flexibility of the regulatory framework have allowed the impact of the referendum result to be dampened rather than amplified. Official data on economic activity covering the period since the referendum are not yet available.  However, there are preliminary signs that the result has affected sentiment among households and companies, with sharp falls in some measures of business and consumer confidence.  Early indications from surveys and from contacts of the Banks Agents suggest that some businesses are beginning to delay investment projects and postpone recruitment decisions.  Regarding the housing market, survey data point to a significant weakening in expected activity.  Taken together, these indicators suggest economic activity is likely to weaken in the near term. Twelve-month CPI inflation was 0.3% in May and remains well below the 2% inflation target.  Measures of core inflation have been stable at a little over 1%.  The shortfall in headline inflation is due predominantly to unusually large drags from energy and food prices, which are expected to attenuate over the next year.  In addition, the sharp fall in the exchange rate will, in the short run, put upward pressure on inflation as the prices of internationally traded commodities increase in sterling terms, and as importers pass on increases in their costs to domestic prices. Looking further forward, the MPC made clear in its May Inflation Report, and again in the minutes of its June meeting, that a vote to leave the European Union could have material implications for the outlook for output and inflation.  The Committee judges that a range of influences on demand, supply and the exchange rate could lead to a significantly lower path for growth and a higher path for inflation than in the central projections set out in the May Report.  The Committee will consider over the coming period how the outlook for the economy has changed in light of the referendum result and will publish its new forecast in its forthcoming Inflation Report on 4 August. The MPC is committed to taking whatever action is needed to support growth and to return inflation to the target over an appropriate horizon.  To that end, most members of the Committee expect monetary policy to be loosened in August.  The Committee discussed various easing options and combinations thereof.  The exact extent of any additional stimulus measures will be based on the Committees updated forecast, and their composition will take account of any interactions with the financial system. Against that backdrop, at its meeting ending on 13 July, the majority of MPC members judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at present.  Gertjan Vlieghe preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. \n","20210506\n","\n","20160915\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 14 September 2016, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%.  The Committee voted unanimously to continue with the programme of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases totalling up to  £10 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.  The Committee also voted unanimously to continue with the programme of  £60 billion of UK government bond purchases to take the total stock of these purchases to  £435 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. The package of measures announced by the Committee at its August meeting led to a greater than anticipated boost to UK asset prices.  Short and long-term market interest rates fell notably following the announcement; corporate bond spreads narrowed, and issuance was strong; and equity prices rose.  Since then, some of the falls in yields have reversed, driven by somewhat stronger-than-expected UK data and a generalised rise in global yields. Many banks announced cuts in Standard Variable Rate and Tracker mortgage rates in line with the cut in Bank Rate.  Deposit rates fell in August, although on average these falls were slightly smaller than the cut in Bank Rate.  Fixed rates on new mortgage lending also fell. Overall, while the evidence on the initial impact of the policy package is encouraging, the Committee will monitor closely changes in asset prices and in interest rates facing households and firms and their effect on economic activity. The MPC set out its most recent detailed assessment of the economic outlook in the August Inflation Report.  Based on the data available at that time, the Committee judged that the UK economy was likely to see little growth in the second half of 2016.  In light of the tendency for survey indicators to overreact to unexpected events, the Committee expected some bounce-back in surveys of business and consumer sentiment following the sharp falls in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the European Union.  Nevertheless, since the August Inflation Report, a number of indicators of near-term economic activity have been somewhat stronger than expected.  The Committee now expect less of a slowing in UK GDP growth in the second half of 2016. It was more difficult to draw a strong inference from these data about the Committees projections for 2017 and beyond.  Moreover, there had been no new information since the August Inflation Report relevant for longer-term prospects for the UK economy. In the August Inflation Report, the Committee judged that some parts of the economy would be more sensitive than others to heightened uncertainty.  Business and housing investment were expected to decline in the second half of 2016, while consumption growth was expected to slow more gradually, alongside households real disposable incomes.  While most business investment intentions surveys weakened further since the August Inflation Report, the near-term outlook for the housing market is less negative than expected and the indicators of consumption have been a little stronger than expected.  Overall, these data remain consistent with the Committees judgement in the August Inflation Report that business spending would slow more sharply than consumer spending in response to the uncertainty associated with the United Kingdoms vote to leave the European Union. Data on global economic activity have generally been in line with the Committees August Inflation Report projections, with growth in the United Kingdoms major trading partners expected to continue at a modest pace over the next three years. Twelve-month CPI inflation remained at 0.6% in August, lower than projected at the time of the August Inflation Report, and well below the 2% inflation target.  As the unusually large drags from energy and food prices attenuate, CPI inflation is expected to rise to around its 2% target in the first half of 2017, consistent with the August Inflation Report, albeit with the projection a little lower over the remainder of 2016 than had been anticipated in August. The Committees view of the contours of the economic outlook following the EU referendum had not changed. News on the near-term momentum of the UK economy had, however, been slightly to the upside relative to the August Inflation Report projections. The Committee will assess that news, along with other forthcoming indicators, during its November forecast round.  If, in light of that full updated assessment, the outlook at that time is judged to be broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report projections, a majority of members expect to support a further cut in Bank Rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPCs forthcoming meetings during the course of this year.  The MPC currently judges this bound to be close to, but a little above, zero. Against that backdrop, at its meeting ending on 14 September, MPC members judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20170202\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 1 February 2017, the Committee voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%.  The Committee voted unanimously to continue with the programme of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, totalling up to  £10 billion.  The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. As the MPC had observed at the time of the UKs referendum on membership of the EU, the appropriate path for monetary policy depends on the evolution of demand, potential supply, the exchange rate, and therefore inflation.  The Committees latest economic projections are contained in the February Inflation Report.  The MPC has increased its central expectation for growth in 2017 to 2.0% and expects growth of 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019.  The upgraded outlook over the forecast period reflects the fiscal stimulus announced in the Chancellors Autumn Statement, firmer momentum in global activity, higher global equity prices and more supportive credit conditions, particularly for households.  Domestic demand has been stronger than expected over the past few months, and there have been relatively few signs of the slowdown in consumer spending that the Committee had anticipated following the referendum.  Nevertheless, continued moderation in pay growth and higher import prices following sterlings depreciation are likely to mean materially weaker household real income growth over the coming few years.  As a consequence, real consumer spending is likely to slow. In preparing the February Report, the MPC undertook its scheduled regular assessment of aggregate supply-side conditions.  Pay growth, although edging up, has remained persistently subdued by historical standards  strikingly so in light of the decline in the rate of unemployment to below 5%.  This is likely to have reflected somewhat stronger labour supply than previously assumed and, therefore, the presence of a greater margin of slack in the labour market, restraining wage increases.  This updated assessment means that the stronger path for demand in the February projection is roughly matched by higher supply capacity.  Combined with the 3% appreciation of sterling and a somewhat higher yield curve over the past three months, that results in a projected path of inflation that is similar to the one expected in November, despite the stronger growth outlook. The value of sterling remains 18% below its peak in November 2015, reflecting investors perceptions that a lower real exchange rate will be required following the UKs withdrawal from the EU.  Over the next few years, a consequence of weaker sterling is that the higher imported costs resulting from it will boost consumer prices and cause inflation to overshoot the 2% target.  This effect is already becoming evident in the data.  CPI inflation rose to 1.6% in December and further substantial increases are very likely over the coming months.  In the central projection, conditioned on market yields that are somewhat higher than in November, inflation is expected to increase to 2.8% in the first half of 2018, before falling back gradually to 2.4% in three years time.  Inflation is judged likely to return to close to the target over the subsequent year.  Measures of inflation compensation derived from financial markets have stabilised at around average historical levels, having increased during late 2016 as concerns about a period of unusually low inflation faded. Monetary policy cannot prevent either the real adjustment that is necessary as the UK moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany it over the next few years.  Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth.  For this reason, the MPCs remit specifies that in such exceptional circumstances the Committee must balance the trade-off between the speed with which it intends to return inflation to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity.  At its February meeting, the MPC continued to judge that it remained appropriate to seek to return inflation to the target over a somewhat longer period than usual, and that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to balance the demands of the Committees remit. As the Committee has previously noted, however, there are limits to the extent that above-target inflation can be tolerated.  The continuing suitability of the current policy stance depends on the trade-off between above-target inflation and slack in the economy. The projections described in the Inflation Report depend in good part on three main judgements:  that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices broadly as expected, and without adverse consequences for expectations of inflation further ahead;  that regular pay growth does indeed remain modest, consistent with the Committees updated assessment of the remaining degree of slack in the labour market;  and that the hitherto resilient rates of household spending growth slow as real income gains weaken. In judging the appropriate policy stance, the Committee will be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding these and other factors.  For instance, if spending growth slows more abruptly than expected, there is scope for monetary policy to be loosened. If, on the other hand, pay growth picks up by more than anticipated, monetary policy may need to be tightened to a greater degree than the gently rising path implied by market yields.  Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20160804\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending 3 August 2016, the MPC voted for a package of measures designed to provide additional support to growth and to achieve a sustainable return of inflation to the target.  This package comprises:  a 25 basis point cut in Bank Rate to 0.25%; a new Term Funding Scheme to reinforce the pass-through of the cut in Bank Rate; the purchase of up to  £10 billion of UK corporate bonds; and an expansion of the asset purchase scheme for UK government bonds of  £60 billion, taking the total stock of these asset purchases to  £435 billion.  The last three elements will be financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. Following the United Kingdoms vote to leave the European Union, the exchange rate has fallen and the outlook for growth in the short to medium term has weakened markedly.  The fall in sterling is likely to push up on CPI inflation in the near term, hastening its return to the 2% target and probably causing it to rise above the target in the latter part of the MPCs forecast period, before the exchange rate effect dissipates thereafter.  In the real economy, although the weaker medium-term outlook for activity largely reflects a downward revision to the economys supply capacity, near-term weakness in demand is likely to open up a margin of spare capacity, including an eventual rise in unemployment.  Consistent with this, recent surveys of business activity, confidence and optimism suggest that the United Kingdom is likely to see little growth in GDP in the second half of this year. These developments present a trade-off for the MPC between delivering inflation at the target and stabilising activity around potential.  The MPCs remit requires it to explain how it has balanced that trade-off.  Given the extent of the likely weakness in demand relative to supply, the MPC judges it appropriate to provide additional stimulus to the economy, thereby reducing the amount of spare capacity at the cost of a temporary period of above-target inflation.  Not only will such action help to eliminate the degree of spare capacity over time, but because a persistent shortfall in aggregate demand would pull down on inflation in the medium term, it should also ensure that inflation does not fall back below the target beyond the forecast horizon.  Thus, in tolerating a temporary period of above-target inflation, the Committee expects the eventual return of inflation to the target to be more sustainable. The MPCs choice of instruments is based on a consideration of their likely impact on the real economy and inflation.  The MPC has examined closely the interaction between monetary policy and the financial sector, both with regard to ensuring the effective transmission of monetary policy to households and businesses, and with consideration for the financial stability consequences of its policy actions. The cut in Bank Rate will lower borrowing costs for households and businesses.  However, as interest rates are close to zero, it is likely to be difficult for some banks and building societies to reduce deposit rates much further, which in turn might limit their ability to cut their lending rates.  In order to mitigate this, the MPC is launching a Term Funding Scheme (TFS) that will provide funding for banks at interest rates close to Bank Rate.  This monetary policy action should help reinforce the transmission of the reduction in Bank Rate to the real economy to ensure that households and firms benefit from the MPCs actions.  In addition, the TFS provides participants with a cost effective source of funding to support additional lending to the real economy, providing insurance against the risk that conditions tighten in bank funding markets. The expansion of the Bank of Englands asset purchase programme for UK government bonds will impart monetary stimulus by lowering the yields on securities that are used to determine the cost of borrowing for households and businesses.  It is also likely to trigger portfolio rebalancing into riskier assets by current holders of government bonds, further enhancing the supply of credit to the broader economy. Purchases of corporate bonds could provide somewhat more stimulus than the same amount of gilt purchases.  In particular, given that corporate bonds are higher-yielding instruments than government bonds, investors selling corporate debt to the Bank could be more likely to invest the money received in other corporate assets than those selling gilts.  In addition, by increasing demand in secondary markets, purchases by the Bank could reduce liquidity premia; and such purchases could stimulate issuance in sterling corporate bond markets. As set out in the August Inflation Report, conditional on this package of measures, the MPC expects that by the three-year forecast horizon unemployment will have begun to fall back and that much of the economys spare capacity will have been re-absorbed, while inflation will be a little above the 2% target.  In those projections the cumulative growth in output is still around 2 ½% less at the end of the forecast period than in the MPCs May projections.  Much of this reflects a downward revision to potential supply that monetary policy cannot offset.  However, monetary policy can provide support as the economy adjusts.  Had it not taken the action announced today, the MPC judges it likely that output would be lower, unemployment higher and slack greater throughout the forecast period, jeopardising a sustainable return of inflation to the target. This package contains a number of mutually reinforcing elements, all of which have scope for further action.  The MPC can act further along each of the dimensions of the package by lowering Bank Rate, by expanding the TFS to reinforce further the monetary transmission mechanism, and by expanding the scale or variety of asset purchases.  If the incoming data prove broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report forecast, a majority of members expect to support a further cut in Bank Rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPCs forthcoming meetings during the course of the year.  The MPC currently judges this bound to be close to, but a little above, zero. All members of the Committee agreed that policy stimulus was warranted at this time, and that Bank Rate should be reduced to 0.25% and be supported by a TFS.  Eight members supported the introduction of a corporate bond scheme, and six members supported further purchases of UK government bonds. These measures have been taken against a backdrop of other supportive actions taken by the Bank of England recently.  The FPC has reduced the countercyclical capital buffer to support the provision of credit and has announced that it will exclude central bank reserves from the exposure measure in the current UK leverage ratio framework.  This latter measure will enhance the effectiveness of the TFS and asset purchases by minimising the potential countervailing effects of regulatory requirements on monetary policy operations.  The Bank has previously announced that it will continue to offer indexed long-term repo operations on a weekly basis until the end of September 2016 as a precautionary step to provide additional flexibility in the Banks provision of liquidity insurance.  The PRA will also smooth the transition to Solvency II for insurers. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20200130\n","The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. UK GDP growth slowed last year, reflecting weaker global growth and elevated Brexit uncertainties. Output is expected to have been flat in 2019 Q4. Growth in regular pay has fallen back to around 3 ½%, though unit labour costs have continued to grow at rates above those consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. CPI inflation fell to 1.3% in December, core CPI inflation declined to 1.4%, and core services inflation is below its target-consistent range.   The unemployment rate has remained low and stable, and employment growth has picked up. Following its annual reassessment of supply-side conditions, the Committee judges that there has been a somewhat greater margin of spare capacity in the economy over recent years, which has been exerting downward pressure on domestically generated inflation. The most recent indicators suggest that global growth has stabilised, reflecting the partial easing of trade tensions and the significant loosening of monetary policy by many central banks over the past year. Global business confidence and other manufacturing indicators have generally picked up. Domestically, near-term uncertainties facing businesses and households have receded. Surveys of business activity have picked up, quite markedly in some cases, and investment intentions appear to have recovered. Housing market indicators have strengthened and consumer confidence has increased slightly. The Committee will monitor closely the extent to which these early indications of an improved outlook are sustained and follow through to the hard data on domestic activity in coming months. The Committees updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying January Monetary Policy Report. They are based on the assumption of an immediate but orderly move, at the beginning of next year, to a deep free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. UK GDP growth is projected to pick up a little in early 2020. Further ahead, and conditioned on a market path for Bank Rate that falls slightly over the forecast period, the recovery in UK growth is supported by a pickup in global activity, a further decline in Brexit uncertainties and the Governments announced spending measures.   Support from these factors is sufficient to boost demand growth above weakened potential supply growth. As a result, slack is eroded gradually over the first part of the forecast period and a margin of excess demand builds thereafter. CPI inflation is projected to remain below the MPCs 2% target throughout this year and much of 2021. Further out, and conditioned on market yields, strengthening domestic price pressures, alongside a waning drag from energy prices, mean that inflation reaches the 2% target by the end of next year and rises slightly above it by the end of the forecast period. Monetary policy will be set to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Policy may need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained or should indicators of domestic prices remain relatively weak. Further ahead, if the economy recovers broadly in line with the MPCs latest projections, some modest tightening of policy may be needed to maintain inflation sustainably at the target. The MPC judges at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Monetary policy summary and minutes Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20160204\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 3 February 2016, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion. In December, twelve-month CPI inflation stood at 0.2%, almost 2 percentage points below the inflation target.  Oil prices were more than a third lower, in sterling terms, than a year earlier.  Together with muted growth in world prices, the appreciation of sterling since early 2013 has pulled down on import prices more broadly.  Overall, these factors can explain the vast majority of the deviation of inflation from the target in December, and to an even greater extent than at the time of the November Inflation Report.  The remainder of the undershoot reflects subdued domestic cost growth, particularly unit labour costs. Returning inflation to the 2% target requires balancing the protracted drags from sterlings past appreciation and low growth in world export prices against increases in domestic cost growth.  Fully offsetting the drag on inflation from external factors over the short run would, in the MPCs judgement, involve too rapid an acceleration in domestic costs, one that would risk being unsustainable and would lead to undesirable volatility in output and employment.  Given these considerations, the MPC intends to set monetary policy to ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb remaining spare capacity in a manner that returns inflation to the target in around two years and keeps it there in the absence of further shocks. Global growth has fallen back further over the past three months, as emerging economies have generally continued to slow and as the US economy has grown by less than expected.  There have also been considerable falls in the prices of risky assets and another significant fall in oil prices.  The latter appears largely to reflect news about the supply of oil.  Developments in financial markets seem in part to reflect greater weight being placed on the risks to the global outlook stemming from China and other emerging economies.  Looking ahead, growth in the United Kingdoms main trading partners should continue to be supported by the boost to real incomes from low commodity prices, and to some degree by monetary and fiscal policy.  But emerging market economies are likely to grow more slowly than in recent years and the risks to the MPCs central projections of only modest global growth lie to the downside. Although activity growth in the United Kingdom has slowed to slightly below average rates, the domestic private sector remains resilient.  Consumer confidence is robust, supported by a pickup in real income growth, and overall investment intentions continue to be firm, although a sharp retrenchment in capital spending in the oil and gas sector is under way.  GDP is expected to grow at around average rates over the forecast period as a tighter labour market and rising productivity support real incomes and consumption. The MPC has revised down its estimate of the level of potential supply broadly in line with the lower level of demand.  Resilient private domestic demand growth is expected to produce sufficient momentum to eliminate the limited margin of spare capacity during the course of this year.  However, wage growth has been weaker than anticipated and labour costs are expected to rise a little less quickly than thought at the time of the November Inflation Report, contributing to a slower recovery in inflation.  In part that reflects the MPCs expectation that low realised inflation will continue to moderate the increase in wage pressure in the near term.  The mechanical return to higher rates of inflation as past falls in energy prices drop from the annual comparison, supported by the recent fall in the sterling exchange rate and some additional stimulus from lower market interest rates, should in time reverse this effect and support wage gains.  The MPC judges that inflation expectations remain well anchored, though it remains watchful for signs that low inflation is having more persistent second-round effects on wages. The scale of recent commodity price falls means that CPI inflation is likely to remain below 1% until the end of the year.  As the drags from energy and other imported goods unwind, however, domestic cost pressures are projected to build up sufficiently such that, conditioned on the path for Bank Rate implied by market interest rates, CPI inflation is likely to exceed the 2% target slightly at the two-year point and then rise further above it.  This central projection for inflation is modestly below that of three months ago for much of the forecast period but broadly similar by the end.  The MPC judges the risks to the central projection to be skewed a little to the downside in the near term, reflecting the possibility of greater persistence of low inflation. There are significant judgements underlying these projections and a range of views among MPC members about the balance of risks to inflation relative to the best collective judgement presented in the February Inflation Report.  At its meeting ending on 3 February, the MPC judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged.  The MPC judges it more likely than not that Bank Rate will need to increase over the forecast period to ensure inflation remains likely to return to the target in a sustainable fashion. All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on the economic circumstances. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20170511\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 10 May 2017, the Committee voted by a majority of 7-1 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. As the MPC observed at the time of the United Kingdoms referendum on EU membership, the appropriate path for monetary policy depends on the evolution of demand, potential supply, the exchange rate, and therefore inflation.  Aggregate demand slowed markedly in 2017 Q1, and the MPCs central projection contained in the May Inflation Report is now for quarterly growth to remain around current rates, and close to trend.  The slowdown appears to be concentrated in consumer-facing sectors, partly reflecting the impact of sterlings past depreciation on household income and spending.  The Committee judges that consumption growth will be slower in the near term than previously anticipated before recovering in the latter part of the forecast period as real income picks up. In the MPCs central forecast, weaker consumption this year is largely balanced by rising net trade and investment.  The outlook for global activity continues to improve.  Business surveys and Bank Agents reports imply that business investment growth is likely to be higher in 2017 than previously projected.  The stronger global outlook and the level of sterling are providing incentives for many exporters to renew and increase capacity. Sterling appreciated by 2.5% between the February and May Inflation Reports, although it remained 16% below its November 2015 peak.  Over the same time period, shorter-term UK interest rates fell, with the sterling yield curve used to condition the forecast close to its lowest level since the start of the year. CPI inflation has risen above the MPCs 2% target as the depreciation of sterling has begun to feed through to consumer prices.  This impact has been offset to some extent by continued subdued growth in domestic costs.  In particular, wage growth has been notably weaker than expected.  The MPC expects inflation to rise further above the target in the coming months, peaking a little below 3% in the fourth quarter.  Conditioned on the market yield curve underlying the May projections, inflation is forecast to remain above the MPCs target throughout the forecast period.  The projected overshoot entirely reflects the effects of the falls in sterling since late November 2015 on import prices.  This effect is expected to diminish towards the end of the forecast period.  With unemployment falling to its estimated equilibrium rate, however, wage growth is expected to recover significantly, and the drag from domestic costs to lessen, over the same period. Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years.  Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth.  For this reason, the MPCs remit specifies that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. In the MPCs latest projections there is such a trade-off through most of the forecast period, with a degree of spare capacity and inflation remaining above the 2% target.  In the final year of the forecast, however, the output gap closes and inflation rises slightly further above the target.  This is conditioned on the assumptions that the adjustment to the United Kingdoms new relationship with the European Union is smooth, and that Bank Rate follows the market-implied path for interest rates.  At its May meeting, seven members thought that the current monetary policy setting remained appropriate to balance the demands of the Committees remit.  Kristin Forbes considered it appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points. As the Committee has previously noted, there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.  The continuing suitability of the current policy stance depends on the trade-off between above-target inflation and slack in the economy, as well as the prospects for inflation to return sustainably to target.  These projections depend importantly on three main judgements:  that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices broadly as projected, and without adverse consequences for inflation expectations further ahead;  that regular pay growth remains modest in the near term but picks up significantly over the forecast period;  and that more subdued household spending growth is largely balanced by a pickup in other components of demand. In judging the appropriate policy stance, the Committee will be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding these and other factors.  Monetary policy can respond in either direction to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.  On the whole, the Committee judges that, if the economy follows a path broadly consistent with the May central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than the very gently rising path implied by the market yield curve underlying the May projections. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20151008\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy in order to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 6 October, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion. Twelve-month CPI inflation was zero in August, well below the 2% target rate.  Around three-quarters of that deviation reflects unusually low contributions from energy, food and other imported goods prices.  The remaining quarter reflects the past weakness of domestic cost growth.  Although rising, increases in labour costs remain lower than would be consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term, were they to persist at current rates.  Core inflation remains subdued at around 1%, influenced both by restrained labour cost growth and by muted import cost growth, itself partly reflecting the continuing dampening influence of sterlings appreciation since mid-2013. With inflation below the target, and the likelihood that at least some spare capacity remains in the economy, the MPC intends to set monetary policy so as to ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb any remaining underutilised resources.  That will support domestic cost growth and is necessary to ensure that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target rate within two years. The Committee will set out its next detailed assessment of the outlook for the economy in the forthcoming November Inflation Report.  As in recent months, the outlook for growth remains characterised by a number of opposing influences.  On the one hand, UK private final domestic demand, and consumer spending in particular, has been resilient, buttressed by the recovery in real income growth and productivity, supportive monetary policy, and robust business and consumer confidence.  On the other hand, the on-going fiscal consolidation has had a restraining influence on activity and global growth has continued at below-average rates.  Similarly, after the direct effects of past movements in international energy and food prices have washed out of the annual comparison, the outlook for inflation in the medium term will reflect the balance of two opposing forces:  the extent to which domestic costs pressures build, set against any persisting external disinflationary pressure. The most recent official estimates and survey data are consistent with a gentle deceleration in UK output growth since its peak at the beginning of 2014.  The sharp declines in the unemployment rate seen since the middle of 2013 now appear to have levelled off.  Some slowdown in the pace of the expansion and employment growth had been expected by the MPC as a natural consequence of the economy approaching a balance between its supply capacity and strengthening demand following the United Kingdoms gradual recovery from the financial crisis.  Indeed, there is increasing evidence of developing capacity pressures in some segments of the economy, and of labour skill shortages in particular.  Annual regular pay growth in the private sector has risen and now exceeds 3%.  But encouraging improvements in productivity growth have so far limited the impact of that pickup in pay growth on businesses overall costs, and therefore inflation. A deterioration in the global demand environment would slow the pace of expansion further.  That could occur, for example, were the slowdown currently underway in a range of emerging economies, including China, to intensify.  Growth in the euro area, the United Kingdoms main trading partner, has so far remained relatively resilient.  As always, the Committee will continue to monitor international developments, as well as evidence concerning the resilience of the domestic economy, to assess the outlook for inflation and activity in the United Kingdom, and set monetary policy as appropriate in the light of all of those factors. There remains a range of views among MPC members about how each of the factors relevant for the outlook for inflation might evolve in future.  At the Committees meeting ending on 6 October, the majority of members judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.  Ian McCafferty preferred to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points, given his view that building domestic cost pressures were likely to come to outweigh the dampening influence of the appreciation of sterling, causing inflation to overshoot the 2% target in the medium term. All members agreed that the likely persistence of the headwinds restraining economic growth following the financial crisis means that, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  Such guidance, however, is an expectation and not a promise:  the path that Bank Rate will actually follow over the next few years will depend on economic circumstances. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20190919\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 18 September 2019, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. Since the MPCs previous meeting, the trade war between the United States and China has intensified, and the outlook for global growth has weakened.   Monetary policy has been loosened in many major economies. Shifting expectations about the potential timing and nature of Brexit have continued to generate heightened volatility in UK asset prices, in particular the sterling exchange rate has risen by over 3 ½%. Brexit-related developments are making UK economic data more volatile, with GDP falling by 0.2% in 2019 Q2 and now expected to rise by 0.2% in Q3. The Committee judges that underlying growth has slowed, but remains slightly positive, and that a degree of excess supply appears to have opened up within companies. Brexit uncertainties have continued to weigh on business investment, although consumption growth has remained resilient, supported by continued growth in real household income. The weaker global backdrop is weighing on exports. The Government has announced a significant increase in departmental spending for 2020-21, which could raise GDP by around 0.4% over the MPCs forecast period, all else equal. CPI inflation fell to 1.7% in August, from 2.1% in July, and is expected to remain slightly below the 2% target in the near term. The labour market appears to remain tight, with the unemployment rate having been just under 4% since the beginning of this year. Annual pay growth has strengthened further to the highest rate in over a decade. Unit wage cost growth has also risen, to a level above that consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. The labour market does not appear to be tightening further, however, with official and survey measures of employment growth softening. For most of the period following the EU referendum, the degree of slack in the UK economy has been falling and global growth has been relatively strong.   Recently, however, entrenched Brexit uncertainties and slower global growth have led to the re-emergence of a margin of excess supply. Increased uncertainty about the nature of EU withdrawal means that the economy could follow a wide range of paths over coming years. The appropriate response of monetary policy will depend on the balance of the effects of Brexit on demand, supply and the sterling exchange rate. It is possible that political events could lead to a further period of entrenched uncertainty about the nature of, and the transition to, the United Kingdoms eventual future trading relationship with the European Union. The longer those uncertainties persist, particularly in an environment of weaker global growth, the more likely it is that demand growth will remain below potential, increasing excess supply. In such an eventuality, domestically generated inflationary pressures would be reduced. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the exchange rate would probably fall, CPI inflation rise and GDP growth slow. The Committees interest rate decisions would need to balance the upward pressure on inflation, from the likely fall in sterling and any reduction in supply capacity, with the downward pressure from any reduction in demand. In this eventuality, the monetary policy response would not be automatic and could be in either direction. In the event of greater clarity that the economy is on a path to a smooth Brexit, and assuming some recovery in global growth, a significant margin of excess demand is likely to build in the medium term. Were that to occur, the Committee judges that increases in interest rates, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target. In all circumstances, the Committee will set monetary policy appropriately to achieve the 2% inflation target. The MPC judges at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Monetary policy summary and minutes Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20200806\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge at present is to respond to the economic and financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. At its meeting ending on 4 August 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programmes of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the total stock of these purchases at  £745 billion. The Committees projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report. Although recent developments suggest a less weak starting point for the Committees latest projections, it is unclear how informative they are about how the economy will perform further out. The outlook for the UK and global economies remains unusually uncertain. It will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how governments, households and businesses respond to these factors. The MPCs projections assume that the direct impact of Covid-19 on the economy dissipates gradually over the forecast period. Given the inherent uncertainties regarding the evolution of the pandemic, the MPCs medium-term projections are a less informative guide than usual. Global activity has strengthened over recent months, although it generally remains below its level in 2019 Q4. Covid-19 has continued to spread rapidly within a number of emerging market economies, however, and there has been a renewed rise in cases in many advanced economies. UK GDP is expected to have been over 20% lower in 2020 Q2 than in 2019 Q4. But higher-frequency indicators imply that spending has recovered significantly since the trough in activity in April. Payments data suggest that household consumption in July was less than 10% below its level at the start of the year.   Housing market activity appears to have returned to close to normal levels, despite signs of a tightening in credit supply for some households. There is less evidence available on business spending, but surveys suggest that business investment is likely to have fallen markedly in Q2 and investment intentions remain very weak. Employment appears to have fallen since the Covid-19 outbreak, although this has been very significantly mitigated by the extensive take-up of support from temporary government schemes. Surveys indicate that many workers have already returned to work from furlough, but considerable uncertainty remains about the prospects for employment after those support schemes unwind. In the near term, the unemployment rate is projected to rise materially, to around 7 ½% by the end of the year, consistent with a material degree of spare capacity. In the MPCs central projection, GDP continues to recover beyond the near term, as social distancing eases and consumer spending picks up further. Business investment also recovers, but somewhat more slowly. Unemployment declines gradually from the beginning of 2021 onwards. Activity is supported by the substantial fiscal and monetary policy actions in place.   Nonetheless, the recovery in demand takes time as health concerns drag on activity. GDP is not projected to exceed its level in 2019 Q4 until the end of 2021, in part reflecting persistently weaker supply capacity. Given the scale of the movements in output, as well as the inherent uncertainty over the factors determining the outlook, the evolution of the balance between demand and supply is hard to assess.   The MPCs central projection implies that a margin of spare capacity is likely to remain until the end of next year.   The risks to the outlook for GDP are judged to be skewed to the downside. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 0.6% in June from 0.5% in May. CPI inflation is expected to fall further below the 2% target and average around  ¼% in the latter part of the year, largely reflecting the direct and indirect effects of Covid-19.   These include the impact of energy prices and the temporary cut in VAT for hospitality, holiday accommodation and attractions.   As these effects unwind, inflation rises, supported by a gradual strengthening of domestic price pressures as spare capacity diminishes. In the MPCs central projection, conditioned on prevailing market yields, CPI inflation is expected to be around 2% in two years time. The Committee will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to adjust monetary policy accordingly to meet its remit. The MPC will keep under review the range of actions that could be taken to deliver its objectives. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. At this meeting, the Committee judges that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. \n","20200326\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and thereby helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge over recent weeks has been to respond to the severe economic and financial disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19. The spread of the disease and the measures that are likely to be needed to contain it have evolved significantly. The economic consequences of these developments are becoming more apparent and a very sharp reduction in activity is likely. Given the severity of that disruption, there is a risk of longer-term damage to the economy, especially if there are business failures on a large scale or significant increases in unemployment. In the near term, many people will be unable to work for a period and others are adjusting their working arrangements. Many consumer-facing companies are now required to cease operations for a time, while other businesses have also needed to cease or scale back their activities. Household spending on social activities and other delayable forms of consumption is likely to decline materially. In an environment of heightened uncertainty, businesses are likely to postpone investment decisions. Exports are likely to weaken. These effects on economic activity will be offset partly by temporarily higher spending on essential goods and services. Nonetheless, business cashflows will be severely affected in a way that, without support measures, would threaten material numbers of businesses failing, and large and persistent rises in unemployment. There is little evidence as yet to assess the precise magnitude of the economic shock from Covid-19. It is probable that global GDP will fall sharply during the first half of this year. Unemployment is likely to rise rapidly across a range of economies, as suggested by early indicators. In the United Kingdom, even before the introduction of the most recent social distancing measures, the composite flash output and expectation PMIs fell sharply in March to their all-time lowest levels, consistent with a material contraction in GDP. Other timely indicators of activity, such as footfall in shops and the number of flights, have also declined sharply. There have been very significant moves in a range of financial market prices and implied volatilities have risen to historically elevated levels, with evidence of widespread disruption to market functioning. Risky asset prices have fallen and, in the period leading up to the MPCs special meeting on 19 March, yields on longer-term government debt rose. Additional demand for US dollar liquidity contributed to disruption in dollar funding markets, and in other usually liquid markets. The sterling exchange rate has depreciated sharply. Overall, UK and global financial conditions have tightened materially. All major central banks have set out wide-ranging policy responses that have helped to stabilise markets and improve liquidity in government bond markets. The front line of combatting the challenges of Covid-19 comprises the extraordinary efforts of NHS health professionals, carers and volunteers across the country. Monetary policy should take into account the broader public policy response to reduce the disruptive consequences for households and businesses of the spread of Covid-19. This should help to minimise the longer-term damage to the economy when the health crisis abates. In this environment, it is essential that monetary and financial stability are maintained, as these are pre-requisites of longer-term economic prosperity.   Consistent with this, the Bank of England has coordinated its actions with those of the UK Government in order to ensure that these initiatives are complementary and have maximum impact in supporting households and businesses during this period of disruption. The Government has announced a series of substantial fiscal support measures to alleviate some of the severe cashflow problems facing businesses and households. The Bank of England also has a role to play in supporting businesses and households through the economic disruption associated with Covid-19. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) reduced the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0% of banks exposures to UK borrowers at its policy meeting on 9 March.   This action supports the ability of banks to supply the credit needed by households and businesses. The FPC, together with the Prudential Regulation Committee, will monitor closely the response of banks to recent measures, as well as the credit conditions faced by UK businesses and households more generally. On 17 March, HM Treasury announced the creation of the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF), for which the Bank would act as HM Treasurys agent. This will provide funding to businesses by purchasing commercial paper of up to a one-year maturity. As an alternative source of finance for larger companies, the scheme will help preserve the capacity of the banking system to lend to other companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises. The CCFF is being funded by the issuance of additional central bank reserves but is set up in a separate legal entity from the Bank and from the Asset Purchase Facility. The MPC will continue to decide on the overall amount of asset purchases that are financed by central bank reserves. It is therefore taking the size of the CCFF into account when taking its decisions on the target stock of government and corporate bonds financed by reserves necessary to fulfil its remit. As set out in the Chancellors letter on 11 March, the MPC has statutory objectives to maintain price stability and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of the Government including its objectives for growth and employment. The updated remit letter confirms that the operational target for monetary policy remains an inflation rate of 2% measured by the 12-month increase in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). CPI inflation was 1.7% in February. Prior to recent developments, inflation was already set to fall further below the MPCs 2% target. It is now likely to decline to below 1% in the spring, reflecting the pass-through to fuel prices of the recent and sharp decline in the oil price. Further ahead, inflation will be boosted by the significant depreciation of the sterling exchange rate. The MPC will be monitoring closely developments in inflation and in indicators of inflation expectations, including those of households, businesses and financial markets.   Financial market measures of inflation expectations have not risen over recent weeks. The nature of the economic shock from Covid-19 is very different from those to which the MPC has previously had to respond. The scale and duration of the shock to economic activity, while highly uncertain, will be large and sharp but should ultimately prove temporary, particularly if job losses and business failures can be minimised. In the current circumstances, and consistent with the MPCs remit, monetary policy is aimed at guarding against an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions and, more broadly, supporting businesses and households through the crisis and limiting any lasting damage to the economy. Over recent weeks, the MPC has reduced Bank Rate by 65 basis points, from 0.75% to 0.1%, and introduced a Term Funding scheme with additional incentives for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (TFSME). It has also announced an increase in the stock of asset purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by  £200 billion to a total of  £645 billion. Those purchases are being undertaken as soon as operationally possible, consistent with improved market functioning.   The majority of additional asset purchases would comprise UK government bonds. Some additional sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bonds would also be purchased. At its meeting ending on 25 March 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee also voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with the programme of  £200 billion of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, to take the total stock of these purchases to  £645 billion. The MPC will monitor closely the pass-through to banks and building societies lending rates of the recent reductions in Bank Rate. Regarding the impact of asset purchases, gilt yields fell significantly following the previous weeks special MPC meeting and the commencement of additional gilt purchase operations from 20 March.   If needed, the MPC can expand asset purchases further. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely and, consistent with its remit, stands ready to respond further as necessary to guard against an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions, and support the economy.

At its meeting ending on 13 April 2016 the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank rate at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 0.5% in March but remains well below the 2% inflation target.  This shortfall is due predominantly to unusually large drags from energy and food prices, which are expected to fade over the next year.  Despite picking up, core inflation also remains subdued, a consequence of the past appreciation of sterling, weak global inflation and restrained domestic cost growth. Returning inflation to the 2% target requires balancing the potentially lessening drag from external factors against expected gradual increases in domestic cost growth.  Fully offsetting that drag over the short run would, in the MPCs judgement, involve too rapid an acceleration in domestic costs, one that would risk being excessive and would lead to undesirable volatility in output and employment.  Given these considerations, the MPC intends to set monetary policy to ensure that growth is sufficient to return inflation to the target in around two years and keep it there in the absence of further shocks. The MPC set out its most recent detailed assessment of the economic outlook in the February 2016 Inflation Report.  Taking together all of the recent economic developments, the broad outlook for activity and inflation appears little changed. There has been mixed news on near-term prospects for global growth.  Immediate downside risks around Chinese activity have lessened;  in the United States, indicators of GDP growth in the first quarter of the year have been disappointing, but those for the second quarter are more encouraging.  Movements in the prices of risky assets suggest that investors have regained their risk appetite, possibly reflecting more positive global economic data and policy action by central banks.  Nevertheless, given weak supply growth, the Committee continues to expect global growth to be somewhat subdued by historical standards. Sterling has depreciated further over the past month.  Risk-free interest rates in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have also declined.  Together with rises in the prices of many risky assets, these movements should support economic activity.  That said, the likelihood that much of the fall in sterling reflects uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming referendum on the United Kingdoms membership of the European Union raises questions regarding whether the lower level of sterling will persist and its net economic impact. Domestically, growth has been steady, and the MPC continues to expect CPI inflation to rise over the next year.  The pickup in the price of oil and sterlings recent depreciation will support that rise.  There are some signs that uncertainty relating to the EU referendum has begun to weigh on certain areas of activity, as some decisions, including on capital expenditure and commercial property transactions, are being postponed pending the outcome of the vote.  This might lead to some softening in growth during the first half of 2016. At its meeting on 13 April, the MPC judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged.  The MPCs best collective judgement is that it is more likely than not that Bank Rate will need to increase over the forecast period to ensure inflation returns to the target in a sustainable fashion.  However, referendum effects are likely to make macroeconomic and financial market indicators harder to interpret over the next few months, and the Committee is likely to react more cautiously to data news over this period than would normally be the case. All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on the economic circumstances. \n","20151210\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy in order to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 9 December 2015, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion. Twelve-month CPI inflation remained at -0.1% in October, a little more than 2 percentage points below the inflation target.  Inflation is expected to have been slightly positive in November, and is projected to rise further as some of the large falls in energy and food prices at the turn of last year drop out of the annual comparison.  Nevertheless, core inflation remains subdued, and CPI inflation is expected to stay below 1% until the second half of next year. The outlook for inflation reflects the balance between persistent drags from factors such as sterling and world export prices and prospective further increases in domestic cost growth.  The MPCs objective is to return inflation to target sustainably;  that is, without an overshoot once persistent disinflationary forces ultimately wane.  Given these considerations, the MPC intends to set monetary policy to ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb remaining spare capacity in a manner that returns inflation to the target in around two years and keeps it there in the absence of further shocks. The MPC set out its most recent detailed assessment of the economic outlook in the November Inflation Report.  At that time, the Committees central view was that if Bank Rate were to follow the gently rising path implied by the prevailing market yields then CPI inflation would exceed slightly the 2% target in two years and then rise further above it, reflecting modest excess demand.  The MPC judged that the risks to this projection lay a little to the downside in the first two years, reflecting global factors. There has not been much news on international activity relative to the forecasts contained in the November Report, with global growth having been stable at a rate well below historical averages.  Prospects for domestic activity are also little changed on the month, with robust growth in private domestic spending continuing to counter-balance subdued demand growth overseas.  Measures announced in the Governments Autumn Statement mean a slightly lower pace of deficit reduction in 2016 than was previously planned, although the fiscal consolidation will continue to weigh on growth over the forecast period. The projected return of CPI inflation to the target depends on an increase in domestic cost growth sufficient to balance the drag on prices from very subdued global inflation and past increases in the value of sterling.  Despite lower unemployment, nominal pay growth appears to have flattened off recently.  This could reflect short-term volatility in the data.  But earnings per worker could be affected by changes in the mix of employment, including a fall in average hours, in which case the impact on unit labour costs would be limited.  It could also be that lower headline readings of inflation have acted to limit recent nominal pay growth, despite the tightening labour market.  The balance between pay and productivity growth remains a key aspect of the MPCs policy assessment. As in previous months, there is a range of views among MPC members about the balance of risks to inflation relative to the target in the medium term.  At the Committees meeting ending on 9 December, eight members judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at present.  Ian McCafferty preferred to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points, given his view that the path of domestic costs was more likely to lead to inflation exceeding the target in the medium term than was embodied in the Committees collective November projections. All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on the economic circumstance. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20200917\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge at present is to respond to the economic and financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. At its meeting ending on 16 September 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programmes of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the total stock of these purchases at  £745 billion. The outlook for the economy remains unusually uncertain. The MPCs central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report assumed that the direct impact of Covid-19 on the economy would dissipate gradually. They were also conditioned on the assumption of an immediate, orderly move to a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union on 1 January 2021. Conditional on those assumptions, UK GDP was projected to continue to recover. Activity was also supported by substantial fiscal and monetary policy actions. Nonetheless, the recovery in demand took time as health concerns were expected to drag on activity. The unemployment rate was projected to rise markedly, consistent with a material degree of spare capacity, before declining gradually. Conditioned on prevailing market yields, CPI inflation was expected to be around 2% in two years time. Indicators of global activity have been broadly in line with the Committees expectations at the time of the August MPC meeting. The sterling exchange rate index has fallen by around 2%, in part reflecting recent Brexit developments. UK GDP in July was around 18 ½% above its trough in April and around 11 ½% below its 2019 Q4 level. High-frequency payments data suggest that consumption has continued to recover during the summer and is now at around its start-of-year level in aggregate, stronger than expected in the August Report. Investment intentions have remained very weak and uncertainties among businesses are elevated. For 2020 Q3 as a whole, Bank staff expect GDP to be around 7% below its 2019 Q4 level, less weak than had been expected in the August Report. Administrative data suggest that the number of paid employees has fallen by around 700,000 between February and August. The number of furloughed workers has continued to decline;   considerable uncertainty remains around the labour market after the government job support schemes unwind. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 1.0% in July to 0.2% in August, consistent with temporary impacts on inflation from the Governments Eat Out to Help Out scheme and the cut in VAT for hospitality, holiday accommodation and attractions. This triggers the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor published alongside this monetary policy announcement. CPI inflation is expected to remain below 1% until early 2021, albeit slightly higher than expected at the time of the August Report. The path of growth and inflation will depend on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, as well as the nature of, and transition to, the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom. It will also depend on the responses of households, businesses and financial markets to these developments. Recent domestic economic data have been a little stronger than the Committee expected at the time of the August Report, although, given the risks, it is unclear how informative they are about how the economy will perform further out. The recent increases in Covid-19 cases in some parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, have the potential to weigh further on economic activity, albeit probably on a lesser scale than seen earlier in the year. As in the August Report, there remains a risk of a more persistent period of elevated unemployment than in the central projection. The Committee will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to adjust monetary policy accordingly to meet its remit. The MPC will keep under review the range of actions that could be taken to deliver its objectives. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. \n","20190321\n","The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. Since the Committees previous meeting, the news in economic data has been mixed, but the MPCs February Inflation Report projections appear on track. In those projections, a weaker near-term outlook was expected to lead to a small margin of slack opening up this year. Thereafter, demand growth exceeded the subdued pace of supply growth and excess demand built over the second half of the forecast period. The broad-based softening in global GDP and trade growth has continued. Global financial conditions have eased, in part supported by announcements of more accommodative policies in some major economies. Shifting expectations about the potential nature and timing of the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union have continued to generate volatility in UK asset prices, particularly the sterling exchange rate. Brexit uncertainties also continue to weigh on confidence and short-term economic activity, notably business investment. Employment growth has been strong, although survey indicators suggest that the outlook has softened. Most indicators of consumer spending are consistent with ongoing modest growth. As the Committee has previously noted, short-term economic data may provide less of a signal than usual about the medium-term growth outlook. CPI inflation rose slightly to 1.9% in February and is expected to remain close to the 2% target over coming months. The labour market remains tight and annual pay growth, having risen through 2018, has remained around 3 ½%. Given continuing weakness in productivity growth, growth in unit wage costs has also risen, although other indicators of domestically generated inflation have remained modest. The Committees February Inflation Report  projections were conditioned on a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdoms eventual trading relationship with the European Union. The Committee continues to judge that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with those projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon. The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond. The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of these effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. The MPC judges at this months meeting that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. The Committee will always act to achieve the 2% inflation target.

The MPCs outlook for inflation and activity in the November Inflation Report is broadly similar to its projections in August.   In the MPCs central forecast, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, GDP grows modestly over the next few years at a pace just above its reduced rate of potential.   Consumption growth remains sluggish in the near term before rising, in line with household incomes.   Net trade is bolstered by the strong global expansion and the past depreciation of sterling.   Business investment is being affected by uncertainties around Brexit, but it continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by strong global demand, high rates of profitability, the low cost of capital and limited spare capacity. CPI inflation rose to 3.0% in September.   The MPC still expects inflation to peak above 3.0% in October, as the past depreciation of sterling and recent increases in energy prices continue to pass through to consumer prices.   The effects of rising import prices on inflation diminish over the next few years, and domestic inflationary pressures gradually pick up as spare capacity is absorbed and wage growth recovers.   On balance, inflation is expected to fall back over the next year and, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, to approach the 2% target by the end of the forecast period. As in previous Reports, the MPCs projections are conditioned on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdoms eventual trading relationship with the European Union.   The projections also assume that, in the interim, households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading relationship. The decision to leave the European Union is having a noticeable impact on the economic outlook.   The overshoot of inflation throughout the forecast predominantly reflects the effects on import prices of the referendum-related fall in sterling.   Uncertainties associated with Brexit are weighing on domestic activity, which has slowed even as global growth has risen significantly.   And Brexit-related constraints on investment and labour supply appear to be reinforcing the marked slowdown that has been increasingly evident in recent years in the rate at which the economy can grow without generating inflationary pressures. Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years.   It can, however, support the economy during the adjustment process.   The MPCs remit specifies that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. The steady erosion of slack has reduced the degree to which it is appropriate for the MPC to accommodate an extended period of inflation above the target. Unemployment has fallen to a 42-year low and the MPC judges that the level of remaining slack is limited.   The global economy is growing strongly, domestic financial conditions are highly accommodative and consumer confidence has remained resilient.   In line with the framework set out at the time of the referendum, the MPC now judges it appropriate to tighten modestly the stance of monetary policy in order to return inflation sustainably to the target.   Accordingly, the Committee voted by 7-2 to raise Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%.   Monetary policy continues to provide significant support to jobs and activity in the current exceptional circumstances.   All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. There remain considerable risks to the outlook, which include the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal.   The MPC will respond to developments as they occur insofar as they affect the behaviour of households and businesses, and the outlook for inflation.   The Committee will monitor closely the incoming evidence on these and other developments, including the impact of todays increase in Bank Rate, and stands ready to respond to changes in the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target.

The MPC set out its most recent assessment of the outlook for inflation and activity in the August Inflation Report.   That assessment depended importantly on three main judgments:   that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices broadly as projected, and without adverse consequences for inflation expectations further ahead;   that regular pay growth remains modest in the near term but picks up over the forecast period;   and that subdued household spending growth is largely balanced by a pickup in other components of demand. Since the August Report, the relatively limited news on activity points, if anything, to a slightly stronger picture than anticipated.   GDP rose by 0.3% in the second quarter, as expected in the MPCs August projections, although initial estimates of private final demand were softer than anticipated.   The unemployment rate has continued to decline, to 4.3%, its lowest in over 40 years and a little lower than forecast in August.   Survey indicators are consistent with continued strength in employment growth.   Evidence continues to accumulate that the rate of potential supply growth has slowed in recent years.   Overall, the latest indicators are consistent with UK demand growing a little in excess of this diminished rate of potential supply growth, and the continued erosion of what is now a fairly limited degree of spare capacity.   Underlying pay growth has shown some signs of recovery, albeit remaining modest. The sterling exchange rate has been volatile and the price of oil has increased.   Headline and core CPI inflation in August were slightly higher than anticipated. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 2.9% and is now expected to rise to above 3% in October. The circumstances since the referendum on EU membership, and the accompanying depreciation of sterling, have been exceptional.   Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years.   The MPCs remit specifies that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity.   Recent developments suggest that remaining spare capacity in the economy is being absorbed a little more rapidly than expected at the time of the August Report, and that inflation remains likely to overshoot the 2% target over the next three years. All MPC members continue to judge that, if the economy follows a path broadly consistent with the August Inflation Report central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than current market expectations.   A majority of MPC members judge that, if the economy continues to follow a path consistent with the prospect of a continued erosion of slack and a gradual rise in underlying inflationary pressure then, with the further lessening in the trade-off that this would imply, some withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to be appropriate over the coming months in order to return inflation sustainably to target.   All members agree that any prospective increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. At this months meeting, seven members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the demands of the MPCs remit.   Two members considered it appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points.   The Committee will undertake a full assessment of recent developments in the context of its November Inflation Report and accompanying economic projections.

The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The MPCs latest projections for inflation and activity are set out in the accompanying February Inflation Report. They are conditioned on a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the UKs eventual trading relationship with the European Union and the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by market yields. The world economy has continued to slow over recent months, with a broad-based softening across all regions. That deceleration reflects the past tightening in global financial conditions, as well as the initial impact of trade tensions on business sentiment. Global growth is expected to dip below trend in coming quarters, weighing on UK net trade, before rising to around potential rates. Activity is projected to be supported by the more accommodative monetary policies in all major economic areas that markets now expect. UK economic growth slowed in late 2018 and appears to have weakened further in early 2019. This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home. These uncertainties could lead to greater-than-usual short-term volatility in UK data, which may therefore provide less of a signal about the medium-term outlook. Heightened uncertainty and elevated bank funding costs are assumed to subside over time, as greater clarity on future trading arrangements is assumed to emerge. These developments, together with looser fiscal policy, provide support to domestic spending. In the Committees central projection, quarterly GDP growth recovers later this year, with four-quarter growth rising to 2% by the end of the forecast period. CPI inflation fell to 2.1% in December and is expected to decline to slightly below the MPCs 2% target in the near term, largely due to the sharp fall in petrol prices which has occurred since November. As that effect unwinds, CPI inflation rises above 2%. The MPC judges that demand and potential supply are currently broadly in balance. The weaker near-term outlook is likely to lead to a small margin of slack opening up this year. Thereafter, demand growth exceeds the subdued pace of supply growth and excess demand builds over the second half of the forecast period. As a result, domestic inflationary pressures firm, as the upward pressure on inflation of sterlings past depreciation wanes. Under the assumptions that condition the February Report, inflation settles at a rate a little above the target. The Committee judges that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with its Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon.

The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%.   The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at  £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at  £895 billion. The MPCs central projections in the February Monetary Policy Report assumed that Covid-related restrictions and peoples health concerns would weigh on activity in the near term, but that the vaccination programme would lead to those easing, such that UK GDP was projected to recover strongly over 2021 towards pre-Covid levels.   At the time of the Report, a further increase in unemployment had been projected over the next couple of quarters. CPI inflation was expected to return towards the 2% target in the spring and, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, it was projected to be close to 2% over the second and third years of the forecast period. Since the time of that forecast, developments in global GDP growth have been a little stronger than anticipated, and the substantial new US fiscal stimulus package should provide significant additional support to the outlook.   In part reflecting this and alongside positive news on some vaccination programmes, advanced economy longer-term government bond yields have risen rapidly to levels similar to those seen shortly before the pandemic. For the most part this has reflected higher real yields.   Risky asset prices have remained resilient. In the United Kingdom, the sterling effective exchange rate has appreciated and mortgage credit conditions have eased a little. An aggregate measure of UK financial conditions has been broadly unchanged since the February Report. The rates of Covid infections and hospitalisations have fallen markedly across the United Kingdom and the vaccination programme is proceeding at a rapid pace. Plans for the easing of restrictions on activity have been announced and envisage that restrictions could be lifted somewhat more rapidly than was assumed in the February Report. Budget 2021, published in March, contained a number of significant new policy announcements, including the extension of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and other measures to support the economy in the near term which had not been reflected in the February Report. UK GDP fell by 2.9% in January. This was less weak than expected, due mainly to developments in public sector output, but still leaves GDP around 10% below its 2019 Q4 level. The news in recent plans for the easing of restrictions on activity may be consistent with a slightly stronger outlook for consumption growth in 2021 Q2 than was anticipated in the February Report, although it is less clear that this represents news to the MPCs medium-term forecast. The LFS unemployment rate rose to 5.1% in the three months to December, but it is likely that labour market slack has remained higher than implied by this measure. The extension of the Governments employment support schemes is likely to mean that the near-term rise in the LFS unemployment rate will be more moderate than suggested by the MPCs February Report projections, which had been constructed on the basis of existing government policy at that time. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose slightly to 0.7% in January. The weakness of recent outturns has largely reflected the direct and indirect effects of Covid on the economy, in particular the decline in oil prices seen in early 2020. As has been the case in recent MPC projections, CPI inflation is expected to return swiftly to around the 2% target in the spring, as the effects of those earlier falls in oil prices drop out of the annual comparison, and reflecting more recent increases in energy prices. These developments should have few direct implications for inflation over the medium term, however. Inflation expectations remain well anchored. There is judged to be a material degree of spare capacity at present. The outlook for the economy, and particularly the relative movement in demand and supply during the recovery from the pandemic, remains unusually uncertain. It continues to depend on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely. If the outlook for inflation weakens, the Committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. \n","20190801\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 31 July 2019, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. Since May, global trade tensions have intensified and global activity has remained soft. This has led to a substantial decline in advanced economies forward interest rates and a material loosening in financial conditions, including in the United Kingdom. An increase in the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has further lowered UK interest rates and led to a marked depreciation of the sterling exchange rate. Brexit-related developments, such as stockbuilding ahead of previous deadlines, are making UK data volatile. After growing by 0.5% in 2019 Q1, GDP is expected to have been flat in Q2, slightly weaker than anticipated in May. Looking through recent volatility, underlying growth appears to have slowed since 2018 to a rate below potential, reflecting both the impact of intensifying Brexit-related uncertainties on business investment and weaker global growth on net trade.   Evidence from companies, up to the middle of July, suggests that uncertainty over the United Kingdoms future trading relationship with the European Union has become more entrenched. The labour market remains tight. Annual pay growth has been relatively strong.   Consumer spending has remained resilient. CPI inflation was 2.0% in June and core CPI inflation was 1.8%. The Committees updated projections are set out in the accompanying August Inflation Report. They continue to assume a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdoms eventual trading relationship with the European Union. In the central projection, conditioned on prevailing asset prices, underlying output growth is subdued in the near term, reflecting more entrenched Brexit uncertainties. This means that a margin of excess supply persists over the first year of the projection. Thereafter, GDP is projected to accelerate to robust growth rates, reflecting a gradual recovery in global growth and firming UK domestic demand growth, driven in large part by a recovery in investment growth as uncertainties dissipate in line with the Brexit conditioning assumption. The acceleration in GDP results in a significant build-up of excess demand, to around 1 ¾% of potential GDP by the end of the forecast period. After falling in the near term, CPI inflation is projected to rise above the 2% target, as building excess demand leads to firmer domestic inflationary pressures. Conditioned on prevailing asset prices, CPI inflation reaches 2.4% by the end of the three-year forecast period. These projections are affected by an inconsistency between the smooth Brexit conditioning assumption underpinning the forecast and the prevailing market asset prices on which the forecasts are also conditioned. These asset prices reflect market participants perceptions of the likelihood and consequences of a no-deal Brexit.   If, as assumed, Brexit proceeds smoothly to some form of deal, market interest rates would likely rise and the sterling exchange rate would likely appreciate. A more consistent forecast would therefore have somewhat lower paths for GDP growth and CPI inflation. Increased uncertainty about the nature of EU withdrawal means that the economy could follow a wide range of paths over coming years. The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of the effects of Brexit on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. In all circumstances, the Committee will set monetary policy appropriately to achieve the 2% inflation target. The MPC judges at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Assuming a smooth Brexit and some recovery in global growth, a significant margin of excess demand is likely to build in the medium term. Were that to occur, the Committee judges that increases in interest rates, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target. Monetary policy summary and minutes Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20180208\n","The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The MPCs latest projections for output and inflation are set out in detail in the accompanying February Inflation Report. The global economy is growing at its fastest pace in seven years. The expansion is becoming increasingly broad-based and investment driven. Notwithstanding recent volatility in financial markets, global financial conditions remain supportive. UK net trade is benefiting from robust global demand and the past depreciation of sterling. Along with high rates of profitability, the low cost of capital and limited spare capacity, strong global activity is supporting business investment, although it remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainties. Household consumption growth is expected to remain relatively subdued, reflecting weak real income growth. GDP growth is expected to average around 1 ¾% over the forecast, a slightly faster pace than was projected in November despite the updated projections being conditioned on the higher market-implied path for interest rates and stronger exchange rate prevailing in financial markets at the time of the forecast. While modest by historical standards, that rate of growth is still expected to exceed the diminished rate of supply growth. Following its annual assessment of the supply side of the economy, the MPC judges that the UK economy has only a very limited degree of slack and that its supply capacity will grow only modestly over the forecast, averaging around 1 ½% per year. This reflects lower growth in labour supply and rates of productivity growth that are around half of their pre-crisis average. As growth in demand outpaces that of supply, a small margin of excess demand emerges by early 2020 and builds thereafter. CPI inflation fell from 3.1% in November to 3.0% in December. Inflation is expected to remain around 3% in the short term, reflecting recent higher oil prices.   More generally, sustained above-target inflation remains almost entirely due to the effects of higher import prices following sterlings past depreciation. These external forces slowly dissipate over the forecast, while domestic inflationary pressures are expected to rise. The firming of shorter-term measures of wage growth in recent quarters, and a range of survey indicators that suggests pay growth will rise further in response to the tightening labour market, give increasing confidence that growth in wages and unit labour costs will pick up to target-consistent rates. On balance, CPI inflation is projected to fall back gradually over the forecast but remain above the 2% target in the second and third years of the MPCs central projection. As in previous Reports, the MPCs projections are conditioned on the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdoms eventual trading relationship with the European Union. The projections also assume that, in the interim, households and companies base their decisions on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to that new trading relationship. Developments regarding the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union  and in particular the reaction of households, businesses and asset prices to them  remain the most significant influence on, and source of uncertainty about, the economic outlook. In such exceptional circumstances, the MPCs remit specifies that the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. Over the past year, a steady absorption of slack has reduced the degree to which it was appropriate for the MPC to accommodate an extended period of inflation above the target. Consequently, at its November 2017 meeting, the Committee tightened modestly the stance of monetary policy in order to return inflation sustainably to the target. Since November, the prospect of a greater degree of excess demand over the forecast period and the expectation that inflation would remain above the target have further diminished the trade-off that the MPC is required to balance. It is therefore appropriate to set monetary policy so that inflation returns sustainably to its target at a more conventional horizon. The Committee judges that, were the economy to evolve broadly in line with the February Inflation Report projections, monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November Report, in order to return inflation sustainably to the target. In light of these considerations, all members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the demands of the MPCs remit. Any future increases in Bank Rate are expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. The Committee will monitor closely the incoming evidence on the evolving economic outlook, and stands ready to respond to developments as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Monetary policy summary and minutes \n","20161103\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 2 November 2016 the Committee voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%.  The Committee voted unanimously to continue with the programme of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases totalling up to  £10 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.  The Committee also voted unanimously to continue with the programme of  £60 billion of UK government bond purchases to take the total stock of these purchases to  £435 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. At the time of the August Inflation Report, the Committee announced a package of supportive measures that it judged was appropriate to balance the trade-off that had emerged in the economic outlook.  On the one hand, economic activity was expected to weaken and unemployment to rise, given the period of uncertainty likely to follow the referendum on EU membership.  On the other hand, inflation was expected to rise to a rate above the 2% target, for an extended period, as a result of the depreciation of sterling that had accompanied the referendum result.  At the August meeting, a majority of Committee members also expected to support a further cut in Bank Rate at one of the remaining MPC meetings of 2016 if the outlook remained broadly consistent with the one set out in the August Report. In the three months since then, indicators of activity and business sentiment have recovered from their lows immediately following the referendum and the preliminary estimate of GDP growth in Q3 was above expectations.  These data suggest that the near-term outlook for activity is stronger than expected three months ago.  Household spending appears to have grown at a somewhat faster pace than projected in August, and the housing market has been more resilient than expected.  By contrast, investment intentions have continued to soften and the commercial property market has been subdued. In financial markets, the past three months have been characterised by two phases.  In the first, the sterling exchange rate stabilised for a period following its initial post-referendum depreciation.  Supported by the measures announced by the MPC in August and more positive activity indicators, financial conditions and other asset prices recovered from the deterioration seen straight after the referendum, accompanied by a sharp increase in corporate bond issuance.  However, in the period since the beginning of October, the sterling effective exchange rate index has depreciated further.  Market intelligence attributes these latter movements to perceptions that the United Kingdoms future trading arrangements with the EU might be less open than previously anticipated, requiring a lower real exchange rate to improve competitiveness and support activity.  Longer-term gilt yields have risen notably, as have market-implied expectations of medium-term inflation. The Committees latest projections for output, unemployment and inflation, conditioned on average market yields, are set out in the November Inflation Report.  Output growth is expected to be stronger in the near term but weaker than previously anticipated in the latter part of the forecast period.  In part that reflects the impact of lower real income growth on household spending.  It also reflects uncertainty over future trading arrangements, and the risk that UK-based firms access to EU markets could be materially reduced, which could restrain business activity and supply growth over a protracted period.  The unemployment rate is projected to rise to around 5 ½% by the middle of 2018 and to stay at around that level throughout 2019. Largely as a result of the depreciation of sterling, CPI inflation is expected to be higher throughout the three-year forecast period than in the Committees August projections.  In the central projection, inflation rises from its current level of 1% to around 2 ¾% in 2018, before falling back gradually over 2019 to reach 2 ½% in three years time.  Inflation is judged likely to return to close to the target over the following year. The MPCs Remit requires that monetary policy should balance the speed with which inflation is returned to the target with the support for real activity.  Developments since August, in particular the direct impact of the further depreciation of sterling on CPI inflation, have adversely affected that trade-off.  This impact will ultimately prove temporary, and attempting to offset it fully with tighter monetary policy would be excessively costly in terms of foregone output and employment growth.  However, there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated. Those limits depend, for example, on the cause of the inflation overshoot, the extent of second-round effects on inflation expectations and domestic costs, and the scale of the shortfall in economic activity below potential.  In the MPCs November forecast, the inflation overshoot is the product of a perceived shock to future supply, which has caused the exchange rate to fall, alongside a modest projected shortfall of activity.  Inflation expectations have picked up to around their past average levels and domestic costs have remained contained. Given the projected rise in unemployment, together with the risks around activity and inflation, and the potential for further volatility in asset prices, the MPC judges it appropriate to accommodate a period of above-target inflation.  That notwithstanding, the MPC is monitoring closely the evolution of inflation expectations. In light of these developments, and in keeping with its Remit, the MPC at its November meeting agreed unanimously that Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.  It also agreed unanimously that it remained appropriate to continue the previously announced asset purchase programmes, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. Earlier in the year, the MPC noted that the path of monetary policy following the referendum on EU membership would depend on the evolution of the prospects for demand, supply, the exchange rate, and therefore inflation.  This remains the case.  Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20160616\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 15 June 2016 the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion. Twelve-month CPI inflation was 0.3% in May and remains well below the 2% inflation target.  This shortfall is due predominantly to unusually large drags from energy and food prices, which are expected to attenuate over the next year.  Core inflation also remains subdued. The MPC set out its most recent detailed assessment of the economic outlook in the May Inflation Report.  Relative to those projections, there has been limited news on the outlook for the global economy.  Growth in the United Kingdoms major trading partners is expected to continue at a modest pace over the next three years.  In China and other emerging markets, the prospects for activity are little changed and medium-term risks remain to the downside.  Commodity prices have risen since the Committees May Report, however, with sterling oil prices in particular having increased by around 10%. In the weeks since the May Report, an increasing range of financial asset prices has become more sensitive to market perceptions of the likely outcome of the forthcoming EU referendum.  On the evidence of the recent behaviour of the foreign exchange market, it appears increasingly likely that, were the UK to vote to leave the EU, sterlings exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply.  This would be consistent with changes to the fundamentals underpinning the exchange rate, including worsening terms of trade, lower productivity, and higher risk premia.  In addition, UK short-term interest rates and measures of UK bank funding costs appear to have been materially influenced by opinion polls about the referendum.  These effects have also become evident in non-sterling assets: market contacts attribute much of the deterioration in global risk sentiment to increasing uncertainty ahead of the referendum.  The outcome of the referendum continues to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly also global financial markets. While consumer spending has been solid, there is growing evidence that uncertainty about the referendum is leading to delays to major economic decisions that are costly to reverse, including commercial and residential real estate transactions, car purchases, and business investment.  As the Committee has previously noted, potential referendum effects are making economic data releases more difficult to interpret, and the Committee is being more cautious in drawing inferences from them than would normally be the case. The MPCs projections in the May Inflation Report were conditioned on continued UK membership of the EU.  On that assumption, returning inflation to the 2% target requires balancing the drag on inflation from external factors and the support from gradual increases in domestic cost growth.  Fully offsetting that drag over the short run would, in the MPCs judgement, involve too rapid an acceleration in domestic costs which would risk being excessive and lead to undesirable volatility in output and employment.  Given these considerations, the MPC intends to set monetary policy to ensure that growth is sufficient to return inflation to the target in around two years and keep it there in the absence of further shocks. Consistent with the projections and conditioning assumptions set out in the May Report, including a gentle rise in interest rates over the forecast period, the MPC judges that it is more likely than not that Bank Rate will need to be higher by the end of the forecast period than at present to ensure inflation returns to the target in a sustainable manner.  All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on economic circumstances. As the Committee set out last month, the most significant risks to the MPCs forecast concern the referendum.  A vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for output and inflation, and therefore the appropriate setting of monetary policy.  Households could defer consumption and firms delay investment, lowering labour demand and causing unemployment to rise.  Through financial market and confidence channels, there are also risks of adverse spill-overs to the global economy.  At the same time, supply growth is likely to be lower over the forecast period, reflecting slower capital accumulation and the need to reallocate resources.  Sterling is also likely to depreciate further, perhaps sharply.  This combination of influences on demand, supply and the exchange rate could lead to a materially lower path for growth and a notably higher path for inflation than in the central projections set out in the May Inflation Report.  In such circumstances, the MPC would face a trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand and output and employment on the other.  The implications for the direction of monetary policy will depend on the relative magnitudes of the demand, supply and exchange rate effects.  The MPC will take whatever action is needed, following the outcome of the referendum, to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and inflation returns to the target over the appropriate horizon. Against that backdrop, at its meeting on 15 June, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and to maintain the stock of purchased assets, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £375 billion. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20151105\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy in order to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 4 November 2015, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion, and so to reinvest the  £6.3 billion of cash flows associated with the redemption of the December 2015 gilt held in the Asset Purchase Facility. In September, twelve-month CPI inflation stood at -0.1%, slightly over 2 percentage points below the inflation target.  Around four fifths of the deviation from the target reflects falls in energy, food and other imported goods prices, with the remainder reflecting subdued domestic cost growth.  The combined weakness in domestic costs and imported goods prices is evident in subdued measures of core inflation, which are currently around 1%. The outlook for inflation reflects the balance between persistent drags from factors such as sterling and world export prices, and prospective further increases in domestic cost growth.  The MPCs objective is to return inflation to target sustainably;  that is, without an overshoot once persistent disinflationary forces ultimately wane.  Given these considerations, the MPC intends to set monetary policy to ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb remaining spare capacity in a manner that returns inflation to the target in around two years and keeps it there in the absence of further shocks. The outlook for global growth has weakened since the August Inflation Report.  Many emerging market economies have slowed markedly and the Committee has downgraded its assessment of their medium-term growth prospects.  While growth in advanced economies has continued and broadened, the Committee nonetheless expects the overall pace of UK-weighted global growth to be more modest than had been expected in August.  There remain downside risks to this outlook, including that of a more abrupt slowdown in emerging economies. Domestic momentum remains resilient.  Consumer confidence is firm, real income growth this year is expected to be the strongest since the crisis, and investment intentions remain robust.  As a result, domestic demand growth has been solid despite the fiscal consolidation.  Although it has moderated, growth is projected to pick up a little towards the middle of next year, as a tighter labour market and stronger productivity support real incomes and consumption, and as accommodative credit conditions encourage strong investment and a pickup in the housing market.  The Committee judges the risks to domestic demand to be broadly balanced. Robust private domestic demand is expected to produce sufficient momentum to eliminate the margin of spare capacity over the next year.  Domestic cost pressures are expected to build as a result of a pickup in wage growth relative to productivity growth.  CPI inflation is nonetheless expected to remain below 1% until the second half of next year, reflecting the continuing drag from commodity and other imported goods prices.  Beyond that, the dampening influence of sterlings past appreciation on inflation is expected to be persistent, diminishing only slowly over the MPCs forecast period.  In this context, the MPC judges it appropriate to return inflation to the target in around two years. Reflecting concerns about the global outlook, prices of risky assets have fallen since August.  There have also been sizable declines in the yields on safe assets.  These have had opposing effects in the forecast.  The path for Bank Rate implied by market yields, on which the MPCs projections are conditioned, has fallen and now embodies an even more gradual pace of tightening than at the time of the previous Report. In the Committees judgement, the lower path for Bank Rate implied by market yields would provide more than adequate support to domestic demand to bring inflation to target even in the face of global weakness.  In that case, the MPCs best collective judgement is for the most likely path for inflation to exceed slightly the 2% target in two years and then rise a little further above it, reflecting modest excess demand.  The MPC judges that the risks to this projection lie slightly to the downside in the first two years, reflecting global factors. Underlying those projections are significant judgements in a number of areas, as described in the November Inflation Report.  In any one of these areas, developments might easily turn out differently than assumed, with implications for the outlook for growth and inflation, and therefore for the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Reflecting that, there is a range of views among MPC members about the balance of risks to inflation relative to the best collective judgement presented in the November Report.  At the Committees meeting ending on 4 November, the majority of MPC members judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at present.  Ian McCafferty preferred to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points, given his view that the path of domestic costs was more likely to lead to inflation exceeding the target in the medium term than was embodied in the Committees collective November projections. All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on the economic circumstances. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20180621\n","The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. In the MPCs most recent projections, set out in the May Inflation Report, GDP was expected to grow by around 1 ¾% per year on average over the forecast, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by market yields at the time. In those projections, growth continued to rotate towards net trade and business investment and away from consumption. While modest by historical standards, the projected pace of GDP growth over the forecast was nevertheless slightly faster than the diminished rate of supply growth, which averaged around 1 ½% per year. As a result, a small margin of excess demand was projected to emerge by early 2020, feeding through into higher rates of pay growth and domestic cost pressures. Nevertheless, CPI inflation continued to fall back gradually as the effects of sterlings past depreciation faded, reaching the 2% target in two years. A key assumption in the MPCs May projections was that the dip in output growth in the first quarter would prove temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter. This judgement appears broadly on track. A number of indicators of household spending and sentiment have bounced back strongly from what appeared to be erratic weakness in Q1, in part related to the adverse weather. Employment growth has remained solid. Although manufacturing output recorded a decline in April, and this was accompanied by a fall in goods exports, surveys of business activity have been stable and, as a whole, point to growth in the second quarter in line with the Committees May projections. Internationally, activity data have been mixed. Indicators suggest that US growth bounced back strongly in Q2 from the softness in Q1. Euro-area growth has been weaker than expected, and downside risks have increased in some emerging markets, in part reflecting tighter financial conditions. More broadly, the prospects for global GDP growth remain strong, and while financial conditions have tightened somewhat, they continue to be accommodative. CPI inflation was 2.4% in May, unchanged from April. Inflation is expected to pick up by slightly more than projected in May in the near term, reflecting higher dollar oil prices and a weaker sterling exchange rate. Most indicators of pay growth have picked up over the past year and the labour market remains tight, suggesting that domestic cost pressures will continue to firm gradually, as expected. The Committees best collective judgement remains that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with the May Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a conventional horizon. For the majority of members, an increase in Bank Rate was not required at this meeting. All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. In addition to its discussion of the immediate policy decision, the Committee reviewed its previous guidance on the level of Bank Rate at which the MPC will consider whether to start to reduce the stock of purchased assets. The MPC continues to expect to maintain the stock of purchased assets until Bank Rate reaches a level from which it can be cut materially, reflecting the Committees preference to use Bank Rate as the primary instrument for monetary policy. Since the previous guidance, the Committee has reduced Bank Rate from 0.5% to 0.25% in August 2016 and has noted that it could lower it further if required.   Reflecting this, the MPC now intends not to reduce the stock of purchased assets until Bank Rate reaches around 1.5%, compared to the previous guidance of around 2%.   Any reduction in the stock of purchased assets will be conducted at a gradual and predictable pace. Decisions on Bank Rate will take into account any impact of changes in the stock of purchased assets on overall monetary conditions, in order to achieve the inflation target. In the event that potential movements in Bank Rate are judged insufficient to achieve the inflation target, the reduction in the stock of assets could be amended or reversed.

The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The MPCs most recent economic projections, set out in the May Inflation Report, assumed a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdoms eventual trading relationship with the European Union and were conditioned on a path for Bank Rate that rose to around 1% by the end of the forecast period. In those projections, GDP growth was a little below potential during 2019 as a whole, reflecting subdued global growth and ongoing Brexit uncertainties. Growth then picked up above the subdued pace of potential supply growth, such that excess demand rose above 1% of potential output by the end of the forecast period. As excess demand emerged, domestic inflationary pressures firmed, such that CPI inflation picked up to above the 2% target in two years time and was still rising at the end of the three-year forecast period. Since the Committees previous meeting, the near-term data have been broadly in line with the May Report, but downside risks to growth have increased.   Globally, trade tensions have intensified. Domestically, the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen. Trade concerns have contributed to volatility in global equity prices and corporate bond spreads, as well as falls in industrial metals prices. Forward interest rates in major economies have fallen materially further.   Increased Brexit uncertainties have put additional downward pressure on UK forward interest rates and led to a decline in the sterling exchange rate. As expected, recent UK data have been volatile, in large part due to Brexit-related effects on financial markets and businesses. After growing by 0.5% in 2019 Q1, GDP is now expected to be flat in Q2. That in part reflects an unwind of the positive contribution to GDP in the first quarter from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks significantly ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. Looking through recent volatility, underlying growth in the United Kingdom appears to have weakened slightly in the first half of the year relative to 2018 to a rate a little below its potential. The underlying pattern of relatively strong household consumption growth but weak business investment has persisted. CPI inflation was 2.0% in May. It is likely to fall below the 2% target later this year, reflecting recent falls in energy prices. Core CPI inflation was 1.7% in May, and core services CPI inflation has remained slightly below levels consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. The labour market remains tight, with recent data on employment, unemployment and regular pay in line with expectations at the time of the May Report. Growth in unit wage costs has remained at target-consistent levels. The Committee continues to judge that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with its May Inflation Report projections that included an assumption of a smooth Brexit, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon. The MPC judges at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy is appropriate. The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond. The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of these effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. The Committee will always act to achieve the 2% inflation target.

CPI inflation fell back to zero in June.  As set out in the Governors open letter to the Chancellor, around three quarters of the deviation of inflation from the 2% target, or 1 ½ percentage points, reflects unusually low contributions from energy, food, and other imported goods prices.  The remaining quarter of the deviation of inflation from target, or  ½ a percentage point, reflects the past weakness of domestic cost growth, and unit labour costs in particular.  The combined weakness in domestic costs and imported goods prices is evident in subdued core inflation, which on most measures is currently around 1%.

Conditional upon Bank Rate following the gently rising path implied by market yields, the Committee judges that this is likely to be achieved. In its latest economic projections, the Committee projects UK-weighted world demand to expand at a moderate pace.  Growth in advanced economies is expected to be a touch faster, and growth in emerging economies a little slower, than in the past few years.  The support to UK exports from steady global demand growth is expected to be counterbalanced, however, by the effect of the past appreciation of sterling.  Risks to global growth are judged to be skewed moderately to the downside reflecting, for example, risks to activity in the euro area and China. Private domestic demand growth in the United Kingdom is expected to remain robust.  Household spending has been supported by the boost to real incomes from lower food and energy prices.  Wage growth has picked up as the labour market has tightened and productivity has strengthened.  Business and consumer confidence remain high, while credit conditions have continued to improve, with historically low mortgage rates providing support to activity in the housing market.  Business investment has made a substantial contribution to growth in recent years.  Firms have invested to expand capacity, supported by accommodative financial conditions.  Despite weakening slightly, surveys suggest continued robust investment growth ahead.  This will support the continuing increase of underlying productivity growth towards past average rates. Robust private domestic demand is expected to produce sufficient momentum to eliminate the margin of spare capacity over the next year or so, despite the continuing fiscal consolidation and modest global growth.  This is judged likely to generate the rise in domestic costs expected to be necessary to return inflation to the target in the medium term. The near-term outlook for inflation is muted.  The falls in energy prices of the past few months will continue to bear down on inflation at least until the middle of next year.  Nonetheless, a range of measures suggest that medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  There is little evidence in wage settlements or spending patterns of any deflationary mindset among businesses and households. Sterling has appreciated by 3 ½% since May and 20% since its trough in March 2013.  The drag on import prices from this appreciation will continue to push down on inflation for some time to come, posing a downside risk to its path in the near term.  Set against that, the degree of slack in the economy has diminished substantially over the past two and a half years.  The unemployment rate has fallen by more than 2 percentage points since the middle of 2013, and the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment has returned from well below to around its pre-crisis average.  The margin of spare capacity is currently judged to be around  ½% of GDP, with a range of views among MPC members around that central estimate.  A further modest tightening of the labour market is expected, supporting a continued firming in the growth of wages and unit labour costs over the next three years, counterbalancing the drag on inflation from sterling. Were Bank Rate to follow the gently rising path implied by market yields, the Committee judges that demand growth would be sufficient to return inflation to the target within two years.  In its projections, inflation then moves slightly above the target in the third year of the forecast period as sustained growth leads to a degree of excess demand. Underlying those projections are significant judgements in a number of areas, as described in the August Inflation Report.  In any one of these areas, developments might easily turn out differently than assumed with implications for the outlook for growth and inflation, and therefore for the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Reflecting that, there is a spread of views among MPC members about the balance of risks to inflation relative to the best collective judgement presented in the August Report.  At the Committees meeting ending on 5 August, the majority of MPC members judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at present.  Ian McCafferty preferred to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points, given his view that demand growth and wage pressures were likely to be greater, and the margin of spare capacity smaller, than embodied in the Committees collective August projections. All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on the economic circumstances.  The Committee will continue to monitor closely the incoming data. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20211216\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 15 December 2021, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to increase Bank Rate by 0.15 percentage points, to 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £875 billion, and so the total target stock of asset purchases at  £895 billion. In the MPCs central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report, global and UK GDP were expected to recover further from the effects of Covid-19 (Covid) in the near term. Conditioned on the rising path for Bank Rate expected by financial markets at that time, upward pressure on CPI inflation was expected to dissipate over time, as supply disruption eased, global demand rebalanced from goods to services, and energy prices stopped rising. Earnings growth was also expected to fall back from its current rate. As a result, inflation was projected to fall back materially from the second half of next year. Since the November MPC meeting, the Omicron Covid variant has emerged. It appears to be spreading rapidly within the United Kingdom and around the world. The new variant appears to be much more transmissible than the Delta variant and, on the basis of current knowledge, poses new risks to public health. Global risky asset prices fell in response to this news but have since largely recovered. Longer-term advanced-economy government bond yields have declined. The level of global GDP in 2021 Q4 is likely to be broadly in line with the November Report projection, but consumer price inflation in advanced economies has risen by more than expected. The Omicron variant poses downside risks to activity in early 2022, although the balance of its effects on demand and supply, and hence on medium-term global inflationary pressures, is unclear. Global cost pressures have remained strong. Bank staff have revised down their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q4 by around  ½% since the November Report, leaving GDP around 1 ½% below its pre-Covid level. Growth in many sectors has continued to be restrained by disruption in supply chains and shortages of labour. The impact of the Omicron variant, associated additional measures introduced by the UK Government and Devolved Administrations, and voluntary social distancing will push down on GDP in December and in 2022 Q1. The experience since March 2020 suggests that successive waves of Covid appear to have had less impact on GDP, although there is uncertainty around the extent to which that will prove to be the case on this occasion. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 4.2% in the three months to October, while the number of payrolled employees continued to rise strongly in November. There is little sign in the available data that the closure of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme at the end of September has led to a weakening in the labour market. The LFS unemployment rate is now expected to fall to around 4% in 2021 Q4, compared with the 4 ½% projection in the November Report. Bank staff continue to estimate that underlying earnings growth has remained above pre-pandemic rates, and the Committee continues to see upside risks around the projection for pay in the November Report. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 3.1% in September to 5.1% in November, triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Relative to the November Report projection, there has been significant upside news in core goods and, to a lesser extent, services price inflation. Bank staff expect inflation to remain around 5% through the majority of the winter period, and to peak at around 6% in April 2022, with that further increase accounted for predominantly by the lagged impact on utility bills of developments in wholesale gas prices. Indicators of cost and price pressures have remained at historically elevated levels recently, and contacts of the Banks Agents expect further price increases next year driven in large part by pay and energy costs. CPI inflation is still expected to fall back in the second half of next year. The MPCs remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy has been subject to very large and repeated shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, will as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. At its November meeting, the Committee judged that, provided the incoming data, particularly on the labour market, were broadly in line with the central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report, it would be necessary over coming months to increase Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2% target. Recent economic developments suggest that these conditions have been met. The labour market is tight and has continued to tighten, and there are some signs of greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures. Although the Omicron variant is likely to weigh on near-term activity, its impact on medium-term inflationary pressures is unclear at this stage. The Committee judges that an increase in Bank Rate of 0.15 percentage points is warranted at this meeting. The MPC will review developments, including emerging evidence on the implications for the economy of the Omicron variant, as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the February 2022 Monetary Policy Report. The Committee will, as always, continue to focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The Committee continues to judge that there are two-sided risks around the inflation outlook in the medium term, but that some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period is likely to be necessary to meet the 2% inflation target sustainably. The Committee will reach its assessment on the balance of the risks to medium-term inflation in light of the relevant data as they emerge. 1) Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. 2) UK-weighted world GDP was expected to grow by 0.8% in 2021 Q4, broadly in line with the projection in the November Monetary Policy Report. Supply disruptions, and an increase in Covid-19 (Covid) cases with associated measures, were expected to weigh on euro-area activity, while the US economy was expected to grow more strongly than had been anticipated. Compared to pre-Covid levels, demand for goods had continued to be strong relative to services in the United States, with US households driving almost the entire increase in durable goods consumption across G7 economies over that period. The emergence and spread of the Omicron Covid variant posed downside risks to the global recovery in activity, with the overall effect on inflation unclear. 3) In the euro area, GDP had risen by 2.2% in 2021 Q3 according to the third release, a little stronger than incorporated into the November Report, and leaving the level of GDP only 0.3% below that in 2019 Q4. Bank staff expected GDP to grow by 0.5% in the fourth quarter, slower than had been anticipated in the November Report. Even prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, Covid cases had risen sharply across the region, and several countries had tightened measures during November and December. The composite output PMI had increased to 55.4 in November, driven by a pickup in services output, but mobility indicators had fallen back recently. Supply bottlenecks had also weighed on production, although the manufacturing output PMI had remained in expansionary territory. The euro-area unemployment rate had decreased slightly in October, to 7.3%, and euro-area wage growth had remained moderate in 2021 Q3. 4) In the United States, GDP had increased by 0.5% in 2021 Q3 according to the second estimate, weaker than had been expected in the November Report. This had left the level of GDP 1.4% higher than in 2019 Q4. In the fourth quarter, US GDP was expected to expand by 1.4%, higher than anticipated in the November Report. Household spending had grown strongly in October, although the expected rotation of demand towards services had stalled. Strength in goods spending had continued, particularly durables expenditure, which had increased again after declining earlier in the year as fiscal support had faded. In the labour market, non-farm payrolls had grown by only 210,000 in November, but the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.2%. Wage growth had picked up across a number of indicators, but had remained broadly in line with pre-Covid rates after adjusting for compositional and demographic effects. 5) In China, localised Covid outbreaks and associated measures had weighed on activity. GDP was expected to grow by 1.0% in 2021 Q4, a little below the estimate in the November Report. The housing market had continued to weaken. In other emerging markets, activity had generally picked up in 2021 Q3, although there had been differences across countries. 6) Global cost pressures had remained strong and inflation had risen by more in advanced economies than had been expected in the November Report. In November, euro-area annual HICP inflation had increased to 4.9%. US CPI inflation had reached 6.8%, consistent with PCE inflation of around 5 ½% in November. Strong demand for certain goods, supply disruptions and high energy prices had been behind these increases. 7) The MPC discussed the outlook for global inflation. Price pressures in the United States had broadened across sectors, and prices had not fallen back to the extent anticipated in the sectors that had previously experienced the largest increases. There had been mixed signals from early indicators of cost pressures. Wholesale gas spot prices had risen again in Europe and one-year futures prices had reached new highs. Oil and coal prices had declined from their peak, with the Brent oil spot price now around $73 per barrel. Shipping costs had remained elevated, but Chinese PMI manufacturing input prices had eased in the latest data. Indices of prices and delivery times in the United States and in the euro area had still indicated strong pressures, however, and US and euro-area companies had reported higher levels of material shortages. Chinas zero-Covid strategy alongside the emergence of Omicron could also lead to renewed supply disruptions going forward if, for example, ports and factories were to close. 8) In response to news of the emergence and spread of the Omicron variant, global risky asset prices had fallen somewhat, but had since largely recovered. Global equity prices had declined by around 3 to 5% in the days following the initial news, with larger declines in sectors that had been most affected by previous Covid measures. Global corporate bond spreads had also widened, albeit from low levels. Implied volatilities had risen across asset classes. Overall, these moves had been relatively modest, however, and had unwound subsequently in some cases. 9) Longer-term advanced-economy government bond yields had also fallen in response to news of the Omicron variant. In the United States, some of that fall had unwound subsequently, leaving ten-year US government bond yields around 10 basis points lower overall since the MPCs November meeting. In contrast, in the United Kingdom and the euro area, ten-year government bond yields had fallen by around 20 to 30 basis points since the Committees previous meeting. Those falls had largely been accounted for by a reduction in the real component of nominal interest rates. 10) The path for market-implied policy rates in the United States had risen somewhat since the MPCs previous meeting. In part, that was likely to have reflected US CPI data and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communications. At its 3 November meeting, the FOMC had left its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and had begun to reduce the monthly pace of its asset purchases. The minutes of that FOMC meeting had noted that some participants preferred a somewhat faster pace of reductions that would result in an earlier conclusion to net purchases, an option which Chair Powell had noted subsequently he expected would be discussed again at the FOMCs forthcoming meeting on 15 December. The market-implied policy rate in the United States now reached around 0.7% by end-2022 and 1.3% by end-2023, around 10 basis points higher than immediately prior to the MPCs November meeting. In contrast, the market-implied path for policy rates in the euro area had moved down a little over the same period. 11) In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate had fallen sharply immediately following the MPCs November meeting. Market contacts were expecting Bank Rate to rise in the coming months. In the days running up to the MPCs December meeting, most contacts had expected Bank Rate to remain at 0.1% at this meeting. Following the UK CPI release on 15 December, however, market pricing had become more finely balanced between Bank Rate remaining at 0.1% and an increase of 15 basis points at this meeting. Further out, the market-implied path for Bank Rate reached 1.1% by the end of 2022. Volatility in UK short-term interest rate markets had remained elevated since the Committees previous meeting, in part reflecting diminished market liquidity, some of which was expected to persist over the year-end period. 12) Medium-term inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom had remained above their average levels of the past decade. That contrasted with similar measures in the United States and the euro area which had been around their average levels of the past decade. 13) As the Committee had discussed at its previous meeting, interpreting UK medium-term inflation compensation measures was not straightforward. The use of UK inflation markets for hedging large pension liabilities and the uncertain future wedge between consumer price and RPI inflation meant that inflation compensation measures did not provide a direct read of market participants fundamental views on the inflation outlook. Nevertheless, models that attempted to extract medium-term market expectations for CPI inflation, and intelligence gathered from market contacts, suggested that higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks to inflation might have in part accounted for the above-average levels of medium-term inflation compensation measures, alongside other factors. 14) The sterling effective exchange rate index had fallen by around 1% since the MPCs previous meeting, with a somewhat sharper depreciation of sterling against the dollar of around 3%. 15) Moves in lending rates on UK mortgages had been mixed since the Committees previous meeting. Interest rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at or below 75% had risen by around 30 basis points from their recent low points. This was consistent with a lagged response to the increases in risk-free rates since the autumn, with around half of those increases now having passed through to lending rates. Higher LTV mortgage rates had continued to fall since the Committees previous meeting, albeit at a slower pace. There had been a normalisation in housing activity measures following the end of the stamp duty holiday, while indicators of house price inflation had remained robust. 16) At its December 2021 meeting, the Banks Financial Policy Committee (FPC) had announced an increase in the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate from 0% to 1%, coming into effect from 13 December 2022 in line with the usual twelve-month implementation period. It would also expect to increase the rate further to 2% in 2022 Q2, if the UK economic recovery proceeded broadly in line with the MPCs central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report, and absent a material change in the outlook for UK financial stability. The FPC had also reviewed its mortgage market Recommendations, including considering how its measures had operated since they had been put in place. The FPCs analysis had suggested that its loan to income (LTI) flow limit played a stronger role than its affordability test in guarding against an increase in aggregate household indebtedness and the number of highly indebted households when house prices rose rapidly. The FPC had therefore decided to maintain the LTI flow limit Recommendation, but to consult, in the first half of 2022, on withdrawing its affordability test. 17) According to the ONSs first quarterly estimate, UK GDP had risen by 1.3% in 2021 Q3, a little weaker than the 1.5% projection that had been incorporated into the November Monetary Policy Report. That had left the level of Q3 GDP 2.1% below its pre-Covid level in 2019 Q4. Within that, the initial estimates of private consumption and investment growth, which were often subject to revision, had been materially lower than expected. Total government expenditure had risen by 1.3%, higher than had been expected in the November Report. The sum of the Q3 expenditure components had been significantly less than headline GDP, indicating uncertainty surrounding the expenditure estimates and the possibility of an upward revision to spending in forthcoming releases. 18) GDP growth in October had been a little weaker than expected, at 0.1%. In both September and October, growth had been driven in part by increases in health spending, reflecting strong non-Covid activity such as doctor appointments. There had also been growth in transport and work-related activities, which had reflected the return of workers to offices and higher mobility in general. By contrast, output in some business-to-business services, such as information and communications, and finance, had weakened. Construction output had fallen in October, although this had followed a sharp rise in September. 19) Supply chain disruptions had remained acute, but did not appear to have weighed on activity by more than had been anticipated in the November Report. This was consistent with there having been little news to the level of output in those sectors that had previously been most affected by disruptions, such as manufacturing and construction. The global semiconductor shortage had continued to weigh on car production in particular, and there had been evidence that low availability had constrained new car purchases. According to the latest IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI surveys, supplier delivery times had continued to lengthen in November, and backlogs of work had continued to rise. Other indicators had also shown no easing in supply chain disruptions. The proportion of firms reporting non-labour input disruptions and significant recruitment difficulties in the November Decision Maker Panel had increased slightly, and the Banks Agents had reported an increase in the number of contacts reporting constraints to growth, primarily due to labour shortages but also demand for goods becoming harder to fulfil due to supply chain disruptions. An increasing number of Agents contacts had also reported that they expected supply issues to persist until the second half of 2022, and possibly 2023 or 2024 in some cases. 20) Retail sales volumes had increased in October, leaving the level of sales around 5 ½% above its pre-Covid level. Some indicators of card spending suggested retail spending had remained robust in November. The Banks Agents had reported companies concerns about being able to meet demand for Christmas, and that a lack of stock availability was reducing consumer choice. Looking ahead, the emergence and spread of the Omicron variant was likely to encourage goods, relative to services, spending, as the goods-to-income ratio had returned to around its pre-Covid level. 21) The number of Covid cases had picked up in the days leading up to the MPCs December meeting. With the identification of the Omicron variant, measures had been put in place in England at the end of November and during the first few days of December. On 8 December, the UK Government had announced that additional measures would be introduced for England, including: guidance on working from home wherever possible; extending the legal requirement to wear a face covering to further public venues; daily testing for contacts of Omicron cases; and the introduction of Covid passes for nightclubs as well as events with large crowds. In the devolved nations, a number of measures were already in place, such as wearing face coverings in public places, advice to work from home and Covid passes. On 12 December, the UK Coronavirus alert level had been raised to level four, as transmission of the new variant was judged to be high or rising exponentially, and the UK Government had announced a plan for all those eligible in England to be offered a booster vaccine by the end of this year, while offering additional support to Devolved Administrations to accelerate their vaccination programmes. On 14 December, the UK Government had announced that it would remove the countries on the UKs travel red list and, in Scotland, people had been advised to limit socialising to three households and physical distancing measures in shops and hospitality venues had been re-introduced. 22) There had been some tentative signs that economic activity had started to be affected by the emergence and spread of Omicron in late November. The number of OpenTable seated diners had fallen in recent weeks, although some of this had probably reflected the impact of storm Arwen at the end of November. UK retail footfall and passenger flight numbers had been flat on the weeks to 4 and 5 December respectively. However, mobility data had suggested a moderate decline in public transport use in early December. 23) Overall, Bank staff had revised down their expectations for 2021 Q4 GDP growth to 0.6%, from 1% at the time of the November Report. News to the level of GDP up to October, and the impact from Omicron and associated measures in December, meant that Bank staff now expected GDP in Q4 to be around 1 ½% below its 2019 Q4 level. 24) The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 4.2% in the three months to October, 0.2 percentage points below expectations at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report. Within that, the number of people who had been unemployed for up to six months had remained around its recent record low, although the number of people unemployed for over twelve months had remained higher than prior to the pandemic. LFS employment had increased by 0.5% in the three months to October, to 1.3% below its 2019 Q4 level, slightly weaker than expected in the November Report. Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employee payrolls had risen strongly by 257,000 in the single month of November, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat. Payrolls growth had been revised down in October, for example, from 160,000 to 74,000. Overall, there was little sign in the available official data that the closure of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) at the end of September had led to a weakening in the labour market. Average hours worked had continued to increase in the three months to October, as those on furlough had returned to work, and were now only just over 1% below their 2019 Q4 level. The LFS inactivity rate had been unchanged in the three months to October, and was still around  ¾ percentage points higher than immediately prior to the pandemic. 25) General government employment, based on returns from public sector organisations, had increased by around 219,000 in 2021 Q3 compared with its 2019 Q4 level. LFS flows data suggested that recent increases in public sector employment could be almost entirely accounted for by moves from private sector employment. 26) The stock of job vacancies recorded by the ONS had reached 1.2 million in the three months to November, and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment had also reached another record high since a consistent series had been available from 2001. Those increases appeared to reflect strong demand for labour, as labour market flows data up to 2021 Q3 had shown a similarly strong pace of new hiring. The implied average duration of vacancies and Bank staff estimates of labour market matching efficiency had been around pre-Covid levels. 27) More timely indicators of labour market activity had generally remained robust. The IHS Markit/CIPS composite employment PMI had fallen slightly in November, but had remained at a historically elevated level. The REC permanent staff placements and staff availability indices had remained close to recent record high and low levels respectively in November. Contacts of the Banks Agents in a range of sectors had reported wanting to take on more staff to meet increased demand, and staff turnover had remained higher than normal for many companies. Recruitment difficulties had also been reported to have become more widespread and acute, particularly for the hiring of experienced staff. Early indications following the emergence and spread of Omicron in the United Kingdom suggested that Adzuna vacancies had fallen back somewhat in the hospitality and catering sector. 28) Overall, Bank staff now expected the LFS unemployment rate to fall to around 4% in 2021 Q4, compared with the 4 ½% projection in the November Report. Abstracting from the risks from the impact of Omicron, it was possible that the unemployment rate could fall further over coming months if hiring continued to keep pace with the current elevated levels of vacancies. Any weakness in demand related to the new variant could offset those forces to some extent. 29) Private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had risen by 4.7% in the three months to October on a year earlier, weaker than earlier in the year but broadly in line with expectations at the time of the November Report. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the CJRS and changes in composition, Bank staff estimated that private sector regular pay growth had remained at around 4 ½%, above pre-pandemic rates of around 3%. 30) Other pay indicators had remained strong, consistent with a continuation of the current pace of underlying earnings growth in the near term. The REC permanent staff salaries index, which measured the monthly pay growth of new permanent hires, had increased to another record high in November. Job-to-job flows had reached a record high in 2021 Q3, with particular strength in the number of voluntary resignations. Median pay growth based on HMRC payrolls data had fallen back somewhat from its peak in mid-2021. Looking ahead, a number of contacts of the Banks Agents expected further upward pressure on pay growth next year, in part as strength in consumer price inflation could encourage workers to demand higher pay settlements. Overall, should the labour market remain tight, there appeared to be upside risks around the projections in the November Report for earnings growth to fall back significantly over the coming year. 31) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 3.1% in September to 5.1% in November, compared with the 4.5% figure expected in the November Report. This release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Core inflation had also risen to 4.0% in November. Relative to the November Report projection, there had been significant upside news in core goods and, to a lesser extent, services price inflation. 32) CPI inflation was expected to remain around 5% through the majority of the winter period, and peak at around 6% in April 2022. The latter would be around one percentage point higher than had been expected in the November Report. 33) The further rise in inflation next spring would in large part reflect current developments in wholesale gas and electricity futures prices, which would feed into Ofgems retail price caps from April. Movements in wholesale prices over much of the period following the November Report had been broadly consistent with Bank staffs baseline assumptions of how much these caps were likely to increase, but gas and electricity futures prices had picked up sharply in the days leading up to the MPCs meeting which implied additional upside pressure on utility price inflation if this persisted. The fall in oil prices since the MPCs previous meeting would have a small, and only partly offsetting, negative effect on energy price inflation over coming months. 34) Core goods price inflation was expected to remain well above its pre-Covid average in the near term, accounting for the majority of the remainder of the projected above-target inflation. Services price inflation was projected to remain at above pre-Covid rates and increase somewhat further. Food price inflation was also expected to rise further, reflecting cost increases over recent months. 35) Other indicators of cost and price pressures had remained at historically elevated levels recently. Both the composite input and output price PMIs had reached new record highs in November. A short-term model constructed by Bank staff of CPI inflation excluding energy, housing, education and financial services, based on such survey indicators of price pressures, suggested some additional upside risks around the updated central projection for inflation over the next six months. The Banks Agents had reported that rising costs were increasingly and more frequently being passed through to prices, and that contacts expected further price increases next year driven in large part by pay and energy costs. CPI inflation was still expected to fall back in the second half of next year. 36) Since the MPCs previous meeting, households one-year ahead inflation expectations had risen in the 2021 Q4 Bank/Kantar survey, but had remained unchanged in the December Citi/YouGov survey albeit at a higher level. Medium to longer-term household expectations in these surveys had picked up over recent quarters. The Citi/YouGov five to ten-year ahead measure had remained above its historical average, while the Bank/Kantar five-year ahead measure was still slightly below its historical average albeit that there was a break in this series in early 2020 due to the shift from face-to-face to online surveys. The mean response to questions on three-year and four-year ahead inflation in the HM Treasury survey of professional forecasters had increased significantly recently, but the median response was still consistent with the MPC meeting its 2% inflation target. 37) The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 38) In the MPCs central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report, global and UK GDP had been expected to recover further from the effects of Covid in the near term. UK consumption growth had been expected to slow over the forecast period, in part reflecting the drag on real incomes from higher energy prices. Conditioned on the rising path for Bank Rate expected by financial markets at that time, upward pressure on UK CPI inflation had been expected to dissipate over time, as supply disruption eased, global demand rebalanced from goods to services, and energy prices stopped rising. Earnings growth had also been expected to fall back from its current rate. As a result, inflation had been projected to fall back materially from the second half of next year. Conditioned on the rising market path for Bank Rate at that time, CPI inflation had been projected to be a little above the 2% target in two years time and just below the target at the end of the forecast period. 39) Since the November MPC meeting, the Omicron Covid variant had emerged. It appeared to be spreading rapidly within the United Kingdom and around the world. The new variant appeared to be much more transmissible than the Delta variant and, on the basis of current knowledge, posed new risks to public health. 40) The Committee reviewed recent economic developments, most of which pre-dated any possible impact from the emergence and spread of the Omicron variant. 41) The level of global GDP in 2021 Q4 was likely to be broadly in line with the November Report projection, but consumer price inflation in advanced economies had risen by more than expected. The Omicron variant posed downside risks to activity in early 2022, although the balance of its effects on demand and supply, and hence on medium-term global inflationary pressures, was unclear. Global cost pressures had remained strong. Notwithstanding an apparent stabilisation in shipping prices, global supply chains had remained heavily disrupted. Companies had reported higher levels of material shortages in the United States and in the euro area. 42) Global risky asset prices had fallen in response to the emergence of the Omicron variant, but had since largely recovered. Longer-term advanced-economy government bond yields had declined. 43) Market contacts were expecting Bank Rate to rise in the coming months. In the days running up to the MPCs December meeting, most contacts had expected Bank Rate to remain at 0.1% at this meeting. Following the UK CPI release on 15 December, however, market pricing had become more finely balanced between Bank Rate remaining at 0.1% and an increase of 15 basis points at this meeting. 44) As of 15 December 2021, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility had reached  £893 billion, including  £149 billion of the  £150 billion programme of UK government bond purchases announced on 5 November 2020. Including the final gilt purchase auction that was being conducted on 15 December, the programme was due to be completed by the time of the Committees December policy announcement. The Committee had also been briefed by Bank staff on progress towards investing the cash flows associated with reductions in the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases held by the Asset Purchase Facility back into eligible corporate bonds, which had commenced in November 2021. 45) The number of Covid cases in the United Kingdom had picked up in the days leading up to the MPCs December meeting and, upon the identification of the Omicron variant, measures had been put in place in England and had been extended in the devolved nations. On 12 December, the Coronavirus alert level had been raised to level four, and the UK Government had announced a plan for all those eligible in England to be offered a booster vaccine by the end of this year, while offering additional support to Devolved Administrations to accelerate their vaccination programmes. 46) Bank staff had revised down their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q4 by around  ½% since the November Report, leaving GDP around 1 ½% below its pre-Covid level. Growth in many sectors had continued to be restrained by disruption in supply chains and shortages of labour. The impact of the Omicron variant, associated additional measures introduced by the UK Government and Devolved Administrations, and voluntary social distancing would push down on GDP in December and in 2022 Q1. The experience since March 2020 suggested that successive waves of Covid appeared to have had less impact on GDP, although there was uncertainty around the extent to which that would prove to be the case on this occasion. There had already been some tentative signs that UK economic activity had started to be affected by the emergence and spread of Omicron. As in previous Covid waves, headline GDP was still likely to be affected significantly by the ways in which public-sector output was measured in the UK national accounts. 47) The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 4.2% in the three months to October, while the number of payrolled employees had continued to rise strongly in November. There was little sign in the available data that the closure of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme at the end of September had led to a weakening in the labour market. The LFS unemployment rate was now expected to fall to around 4% in 2021 Q4, compared with the 4 ½% projection in the November Report. Abstracting from the risks from the impact of the Omicron variant, it was possible that the unemployment rate could fall further over coming months if hiring continued to keep pace with the current elevated levels of vacancies. Any weakness in demand related to the new variant could offset those forces to some extent. 48) Bank staff continued to estimate that underlying earnings growth had remained above pre-pandemic rates, and the Committee continued to see upside risks around the projection for pay in the November Report. The REC permanent staff salaries index and job-to-job flows had both increased to record highs, and contacts of the Banks Agents expected strength in consumer price inflation to encourage workers to demand higher pay settlements. 49) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 3.1% in September to 5.1% in November, 0.6 percentage points higher than had been expected at the time of the November Report, and triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Core inflation had also risen to 4.0% in November. Relative to the November Report projection, there had been significant upside news in core goods and, to a lesser extent, services price inflation. 50) Bank staff expected inflation to remain around 5% through the majority of the winter period, and to peak at around 6% in April 2022, with that further increase accounted for predominantly by the lagged impact on utility bills of developments in wholesale gas prices. Indicators of cost and price pressures had remained at historically elevated levels recently, and contacts of the Banks Agents expected further price increases next year driven in large part by pay and energy costs. CPI inflation was still expected to fall back in the second half of next year. 51) Since the Committees previous meeting, medium-term measures of UK financial market inflation compensation had remained above their average levels over the past decade. In part, that was likely to reflect market participants somewhat higher central expectations for inflation. Measures of medium to longer-term household inflation expectations had picked up over recent quarters, with the Citi/YouGov five to ten-year ahead measure remaining above its historical average, while the Bank/Kantar five-year ahead measure was still slightly below its historical average though there had been a break in this series in early 2020. The median responses in surveys of professional forecasters had remained consistent with CPI inflation being close to target in the medium term. Overall, and as set out in Box C in the November Report, the MPC judged that inflation expectations remained well anchored in the United Kingdom at present. The Committee would, nevertheless, continue to monitor very closely the risk that domestic and global demand and cost pressures could affect medium-term inflation expectations, and so wage and price setting. 52) In the run-up to its policy decision, the Committee had been briefed by the Chief Medical Officer for England on recent Covid developments, including the risks to public health from the Omicron variant. 53) The Committee discussed the possible implications of recent Covid developments for the economic outlook. The MPC had noted previously the risks to the economy from a drop in vaccine effectiveness arising from viral mutations, although it was unclear currently to what extent the Omicron variant would lead to a decline in vaccine protection against severe disease. Given the clear signs of increased transmissibility for the new variant, there was the potential for a very high number of infections over a very short period. 54) It was important to note that the current position of the global and UK economies was materially different compared with prior to the onset of the pandemic, including the elevated levels of consumer price inflation. Global inflationary pressures had been influenced significantly by the shift in spending from services to durable goods that the pandemic had induced. In the MPCs November Report forecast, it had been assumed that a rebalancing of demand would lead to a gradual reduction in the inflation rate, and in some cases the level, of the prices of traded goods. The possibility of renewed social distancing meant that this rebalancing was now more likely to be delayed and so global price pressures might persist for longer, although there were limits to how much further households stocks of durables were likely to rise and the responses of fiscal policy globally to the new variant was uncertain. A potential worsening of global supply chain disruption could also push up on inflationary pressures. For example, Chinas current zero-Covid strategy could lead to renewed disruptions at Chinese factories and ports, and could affect shipping costs. Against that, aggregate demand could slow, reducing inflationary pressures, particularly for some consumer-facing services, and any change in expectations of future demand might lead to some loosening of labour market conditions. Demand conditions could nevertheless remain strong if households deployed savings that had been built up during the course of the pandemic to a greater extent than had been assumed in the November Report. Overall, the balance of these effects on inflation was unclear. 55) So far, successive waves of Covid had tended to have less impact on GDP and consumer spending than previous waves, but there was uncertainty around the extent to which that would prove to be the case on this occasion. Progressively more limited reductions in mobility and social interactions might have reflected the successful roll-out of vaccines and the protection that these offered against the Delta variant. The emergence of a new, partially vaccine-resistant Covid variant might therefore have a significant negative impact on consumer confidence and on economic behaviour. There could, however, also be limits to the extent to which households would adjust their behaviour further. For example, a large number of employees had continued to work from home prior to the recent change in government guidance, growth in consumer spending on restaurants had continued to be supported by sales of take-away and delivery food in addition to seated dining, and online retail sales had remained strong. More generally, spending less on one category of consumption did not necessarily mean a like-for-like reduction in total spending. Such aggregate consumption decisions should be more closely related to household expectations of future income, including expectations beyond the point at which the pandemic was likely to be at its immediate peak. 56) The outlook for UK activity, and the balance of the effects of the Omicron variant on demand and supply, would also depend on the responses of other policymakers in the United Kingdom and abroad. 57) The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 58) The MPCs remit was clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there will be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy had been subject to very large and repeated shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, would as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that were likely to be transient. 59) At its November meeting, the Committee had judged that, provided the incoming data, particularly on the labour market, were broadly in line with the central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report, it would be necessary over coming months to increase Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2% target. Recent economic developments suggested that these conditions had been met. The labour market was tight and had continued to tighten, and there were some signs of greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures. Although the Omicron variant was likely to weigh on near-term activity, its impact on medium-term inflationary pressures was unclear at this stage. 60) At this meeting, most members of the Committee judged that an immediate, small increase in Bank Rate was warranted. Although the conditions for tightening set out in November had been met, the decision at this meeting was finely balanced because of the uncertainty around Covid developments. There was some value in waiting for further information on the degree to which Omicron was likely to escape the protection of current vaccines and on the initial economic effects of this new wave. There was, however, also a strong case for tightening monetary policy now, given the strength of current underlying inflationary pressures and in order to maintain price stability in the medium term. The economic impact of the new variant could, in some scenarios, increase these inflationary pressures further. Moreover, maintaining the current monetary policy stance when CPI inflation was materially above the 2% target and the output gap appeared to be closed might cause medium-term inflation expectations to drift up further. 61) One member of the Committee judged that, were it not for the emergence of the Omicron variant, an increase in Bank Rate could have been appropriate at this meeting. However, the significant uncertainty introduced by Omicron warranted waiting until February for more clarity before considering any change in Bank Rate. UK output remained below its 2019 Q4 level and further below the trend for potential. The new variant and renewed voluntary social distancing would unambiguously slow economic activity, but would have two-sided effects on inflation. The overall effect of Omicron on the short-term trade-off between inflation and output, and on the medium-term prospects for inflation, would depend critically on the transmissibility, vaccine resistance and severity of the variant, but also on the overall policy response, both domestically and abroad. Some scenarios would call for tighter monetary policy, while others would require a somewhat longer period of accommodation. In line with risk management concerns owing to the asymmetry of available monetary policy tools, this member preferred to wait for further evidence that the recovery remained entrenched, and was not threatened materially by the new variant, before tightening monetary policy. 62) The MPC would review developments, including emerging evidence on the implications for the economy of the Omicron variant, as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the February 2022 Monetary Policy Report. The Committee would, as always, continue to focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The Committee continued to judge that there were two-sided risks around the inflation outlook in the medium term, but that some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to meet the 2% inflation target sustainably. The Committee would reach its assessment on the balance of the risks to medium-term inflation in light of the relevant data as they emerged. 63) The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted in favour of the first proposition. Silvana Tenreyro voted against this proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second and third propositions. 64) The following members of the Committee were present: Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Bradley Fried and Diana Harding were also present on 10 December, as observers for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in their roles as members of the Banks Court of Directors. \n","20220317\n","Next due: 5 May 2022 The Bank of England condemns Russias unprovoked invasion and the suffering inflicted on Ukraine. The Bank is working closely with the UK Government to support its response in coordination with international authorities. The Banks Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) supports this condemnation and welcomes these actions. The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 16 March 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.75%. One member preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%. In the MPCs central projections in the February Monetary Policy Report, published before Russias invasion of Ukraine, UK GDP growth was expected to slow to subdued rates during the course of this year. This in large part reflected the adverse impact of the previous, already large, increases in global energy and tradable goods prices on UK real aggregate income and spending. As a result, a margin of spare capacity was projected to open up and the unemployment rate to rise to 5% by 2025. CPI inflation was expected to peak at around 7 ¼% in April 2022. Upward pressures on inflation were expected to dissipate over time and, conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate expected at the time of the February Report and the MPCs current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation was projected to fall back to a little above the 2% target in two years time and to below the target by a greater margin in three years. Developments since the February Report are likely to accentuate both the peak in inflation and the adverse impact on activity by intensifying the squeeze on household incomes. Regarding inflation, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has led to further large increases in energy and other commodity prices including food prices. It is also likely to exacerbate global supply chain disruptions, and has increased the uncertainty around the economic outlook significantly. Global inflationary pressures will strengthen considerably further over coming months, while growth in economies that are net energy importers, including the United Kingdom, is likely to slow. Turning to economic activity, UK GDP in January was stronger than expected in the February Report. Business confidence has held up and labour market activity data have remained robust. Consumer confidence has, however, fallen in response to the squeeze on real household disposable incomes. That impact on real aggregate income is now likely to be materially larger than implied by the projections in the February Report, consistent with a weaker outlook for growth and employment, all else equal. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 5.4% in December to 5.5% in January, which triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Inflation is expected to increase further in coming months, to around 8% in 2022 Q2, and perhaps even higher later this year. The projected overshoot of inflation relative to the 2% target to an increasing extent reflects global energy prices, with some further material contribution from tradable goods prices. Service price inflation has also picked up, although to a lesser extent than other components, with core services prices returning to their pre-Covid trend. Underlying nominal earnings growth is estimated to have remained above pre-pandemic rates, and is still expected to strengthen over the coming year. If sustained, the latest rise in energy futures prices means that Ofgems utility price caps could again be substantially higher when they are reset in October 2022. This could temporarily push CPI inflation around the end of this year above the level projected for April, which was previously expected to be the peak. Further out, inflation is expected to fall back materially, as energy prices stop rising and as the squeeze on real incomes and demand puts significant downward pressure on domestically generated inflation. That judgement also reflects that monetary policy will act to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored around the 2% target. The MPCs remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russias invasion of Ukraine is another such shock. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent, the very elevated levels of global energy and tradable goods prices, of which the United Kingdom is a net importer, will necessarily weigh further on UK real aggregate income and spending. This is something monetary policy is unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy is to ensure that, as this real economic adjustment occurs, it does so consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. Given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures will persist, the Committee judges that an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points is warranted at this meeting. Based on its current assessment of the economic situation, the Committee judges that some further modest tightening in monetary policy may be appropriate in the coming months, but there are risks on both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects for inflation evolve. The MPC will review developments in the light of incoming data and their implications for medium-term inflation, including the economic implications of recent geopolitical events, as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the May 2022 Monetary Policy Report. 1: The Bank of England condemned Russias unprovoked invasion and the suffering inflicted on Ukraine. The Bank was working closely with the UK Government to support its response in coordination with international authorities. The Banks Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) supported this condemnation and welcomed these actions. 2: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. 3: The global economic outlook had deteriorated significantly following Russias invasion of Ukraine in late February, and the associated material increase in the prices of energy and raw materials. These price increases would further raise global consumer and producer price inflation in the near term from already high rates, and erode real aggregate income for net commodity-importing countries. Renewed supply chain problems were also likely to emerge as production of, and trade in, important inputs declined, due both to the physical disruption caused by the invasion and the effects of sanctions imposed on Russia. 4: GDP growth in the United States and in the euro area in 2021 Q4 had been broadly in line with expectations in the February Report, and was expected to be slightly stronger in 2022 Q1 than had been anticipated, particularly in the euro area. Euro-area PMIs had picked up sharply in February, indicating that the economic impact of the Omicron Covid variant had been less severe than expected. In the United States, household consumption had rebounded in January, although the rotation from goods to services spending had stalled. Unemployment rates had fallen further in the euro area and the United States at the turn of the year, and wage growth had continued to rise in the United States according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantas measure. 5: Chinese activity data for January and February combined, including industrial production and retail sales, had been stronger than expected, reflecting a smaller impact from the Omicron Covid variant at that time. Following a rapid pickup in Covid cases in Hong Kong accompanied by a high mortality rate, Covid cases had, however, started rising again in China, and Chinese authorities had continued to react with tight local restrictions in line with the countrys current Covid strategy. There had been reports of factories stopping production in response, which could lead to supply disruption and weigh on economic activity. 6: Even prior to the most recent increases in energy prices, consumer price inflation had been high in many economies. Euro-area annual HICP inflation had increased to 5.8% in February, with core inflation at 2.7%. US annual CPI inflation had risen to 7.9% in February, and core inflation to 6.4%. The headline US CPI figure was consistent with annual PCE inflation around 6 ½%. In the euro area, HICP inflation had been driven in large part by increases in energy prices over recent months, in particular gas prices. Contributions to US CPI inflation had been broad-based across components: within core services, rent and healthcare price rises had contributed particularly strongly, while increases in car and household goods prices had pushed core goods inflation higher. 7: Since the invasion, commodity prices had increased substantially, while exhibiting marked volatility. Russia was a significant exporter of gas, supplying around 40% of the gas used in the euro area, and was also the second largest global crude oil producer. Concerns that gas flows to Europe might be disrupted had led to exceptional volatility in European wholesale gas prices. Those prices had risen sharply following the invasion from already elevated levels in early March, with the Dutch Title Transfer Facility spot price rising to around â¬240 per MWh, before declining again to around â¬115 per MWh at the time of the MPCs meeting, around 40% above the average spot price assumed in the February Report. The futures curve six months out was a little below current spot prices. The spot price of Brent crude oil had also been volatile and had increased by around 17% since the February Report, to around $100 per barrel at the time of the MPCs meeting, in part driven by announcements by the US and UK governments that they would curtail oil imports from Russia. 8: Russia and Ukraine were also major producers of other raw materials, and prices of metals and food had risen by around 15 and 20% respectively since the February Report. Russia accounted for a significant proportion of global pig iron, steel, nickel, aluminium and copper exports that were a key input to many production processes. There had been reports of some car manufacturers having to shut European plants because of a lack of inputs from the region. Russia and Ukraine also accounted for almost 30% of the worlds wheat exports and Russia supplied 16% of the worlds fertiliser. Ukraine was a major producer of neon, which was a key input for the production of semiconductors, potentially leading to renewed supply pressures in this sector. 9: The increases in energy and other raw material prices were expected to boost global consumer price inflation significantly in the near term, directly through fuel, utilities and food prices, and indirectly through firms costs. Supply chain disruption could also add further upward pressure to goods prices. Given Europes reliance on Russian gas, and the fragmentation of the global market which meant that US gas prices had not increased materially, the effect was expected to be larger in the euro area and in the United Kingdom. Higher prices would reduce real incomes, exacerbating the policy challenges facing central banks around the world. 10: The Russian economy was expected to be affected significantly by sanctions. Financial sanctions announced shortly after the invasion began had been aimed at hindering trade with Russia, through restricting the ability of some Russian banks to process foreign transactions, particularly in dollars, and through curtailing access of some Russian banks to the SWIFT messaging service, which made it more costly to process transactions. Transactions with the Central Bank of Russia had also been prohibited, restricting its ability to use its international reserves to support the rouble, facilitate cross-border trade and service debt. More recently, the United States had announced a ban on Russian oil imports, the United Kingdom had declared that it would phase out its imports of Russian oil by the end of this year, and the European Union had set out plans to cut its gas use by the end of this year by around two-thirds of its gas imports from Russia in 2021. There had also been a wave of voluntary withdrawals of companies from activities in Russia. This had not only involved high profile consumer-facing firms, but also a broader range of companies supplying goods and services to the Russian business sector and mining companies. In late February, the Central Bank of Russia had raised interest rates from 9.5 to 20%, had ordered exporters to surrender 80% of their foreign exchange receipts, and had restricted the ability of residents to take capital out of the country. The rouble had fallen by around 25% since the start of the invasion. Central and Eastern European currencies had depreciated by 3 to 6%, and the Polish and Hungarian central banks had raised interest rates. Central and Eastern European countries had experienced a significant influx of refugees from Ukraine. 11: Since the MPCs previous meeting, indicators of financial market volatility had increased and risky asset prices had fallen, reflecting the expected global impact of Russias invasion of Ukraine. Advanced economy equity prices had fallen significantly and spreads on corporate bonds had widened. Option-implied distributions of equity prices suggested that these movements reflected increased pricing of downside risks to equity prices, as well as a shift down in central case expectations. 12: Short-term financial market inflation compensation measures had increased across advanced economies, in large part reflecting the impact of the invasion on energy prices. Medium-term measures had also increased over the same period. It was common for these measures to move together, but recent movements in medium-term measures were nevertheless noteworthy, given that oil and gas futures curves were consistent with energy price inflation falling back significantly beyond the near-term horizon. 13: In the United Kingdom, the increases in medium-term inflation compensation measures had taken their levels further above their average of the past decade. As the Committee had discussed previously, interpreting UK medium-term inflation compensation measures was not straightforward. The use of UK inflation markets for hedging large pension liabilities and the uncertain future wedge between consumer price and RPI inflation meant that inflation compensation measures did not provide a direct read of market participants fundamental views on the inflation outlook. Nevertheless, models that attempted to extract medium-term market expectations for CPI inflation, and intelligence gathered from market contacts, suggested that higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks of inflation persistence had probably accounted for above-average levels of UK medium-term inflation compensation measures, alongside other factors. 14: The sterling effective exchange rate had fallen by 1.7% since the previous MPC meeting, and to a greater extent against the US dollar. 15: The near-term path for market-implied policy rates in the United States had risen since the MPCs previous meeting, although some of this increase had pre-dated the invasion. The market-implied policy rate in the United States reached a little under 2% by end-2022, around 50 basis points higher than immediately prior to the MPCs February meeting. In the euro area, the near-term market implied path for policy rates had also risen since the MPCs previous meeting. At its meeting on 10 March, the ECB Governing Council had left its key policy interest rates unchanged, but had announced a faster reduction in the pace of net asset purchases. 16: In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had risen, with market pricing consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points, to 0.75%, at this MPC meeting. The market-implied path for Bank Rate now reached around 2% by end-2022, around 70 basis points higher than immediately prior to the MPCs February meeting. The latest Bank of England Market Participants Survey suggested that respondents expected a slightly shallower path for Bank Rate than the market-implied path over the next couple of years, but a greater number of respondents viewed the balance of risks around that path as being skewed to the upside rather than to the downside. 17: Longer-term advanced economy government bond yields had increased since the MPCs previous meeting. 18: UK bank lending rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at or below 75% had risen further since the MPCs previous meeting. This was broadly consistent with a lagged response to the increases in risk-free rates since the autumn of 2021. Lending rates on some higher LTV mortgages had also started to increase. However, rates on higher LTV mortgages had, on the whole, remained lower than in autumn 2021, reflecting the normalisation of spreads in this market, which had increased significantly at the start of the pandemic. The subsequent further increases in risk-free rates that had occurred since the February MPC meeting would be expected to feed through to mortgage lending rates in due course. Interest rates on unsecured household borrowing, such as credit cards and personal loans had, as usual, been less sensitive to changes in reference rates. 19: The MPC had been briefed on initial reports from the Banks Agents and Decision Maker Panel on business sentiment following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. But there was little evidence available yet on the impact of the invasion on UK economic activity. The squeeze on real post-tax labour income would, nevertheless, be materially larger than expected previously, due to recent commodity price increases. 20: According to the ONSs first quarterly estimate, UK GDP had increased by 1.0% in 2021 Q4, broadly in line with the expectation incorporated into the February Monetary Policy Report projection and close to the level of activity prior to the onset of the pandemic in 2019 Q4. Household consumption and business investment had risen by around 1% on the quarter, with government expenditure growing more strongly than those components. Business investment had remained more than 10% below its pre-Covid level, however. 21: Following a 0.2% decline in December, GDP had risen by 0.8% in January, notably stronger than had been expected at the time of the February Report, and to a level 0.5% higher than in 2019 Q4. Government services output had been stronger than expected, accounted for by health activity including NHS Test and Trace. GDP growth in January had been broad based across the service, manufacturing and construction sectors. Output in consumer-facing services had risen by 1.8%, broadly in line with expectations at the time of the February Report. This was consistent with other higher-frequency indicators and with a very limited economic impact on high-contact sectors from the Omicron Covid variant. 22: Since the Committees previous meeting, there had been further relaxations, and in some cases removals, of Covid measures announced by the UK Government and Devolved Administrations. Recent high-frequency economic indicators suggested that activity in high-contact sectors was on track to return to its pre-Omicron levels during the first quarter of the year. Data on card spending, restaurant reservations, train journeys and flights had continued to recover strongly over recent weeks. 23: Bank staff now expected GDP to increase by around  ¾% in 2022 Q1, stronger than the February Report projection for a flat quarterly outturn. This nowcast assumed that some of the surprising strength in non-Covid related activity in recent months persisted through the quarter. 24: Prior to the invasion in late February, there had already been tentative signs that the squeeze on real disposable incomes was starting to weigh on the household sector. Although aggregate retail sales volumes had risen strongly in January, food sales had fallen to below pre-pandemic levels as food prices had risen. Notably, GfK consumer confidence had declined materially in February, with the weakness most pronounced in the forward-looking personal financial situation component. It was, however, unclear whether that represented downside news relative to the weakness in real incomes and spending that had been factored into the February Report projections. Intelligence from the Banks Agents suggested that consumer spending had continued to grow at a robust pace. However, contacts were concerned about the outlook for demand over the coming months, due to increasing pressures on households real disposable incomes. 25: Housing market activity had remained robust, and indicators of house prices had surprised on the upside relative to the February Report projections. 26: Recent indicators of corporate sector sentiment had been somewhat more resilient than consumer confidence, although these had generally been collated prior to the invasion. The IHS Markit/CIPS composite output PMI in February had risen to its highest level since June 2021. There had also been signs in the manufacturing and construction PMIs that supply chain disruptions had eased further. Nevertheless, the latest intelligence from the Banks Agents suggested that the invasion was expected to exacerbate shortages of some tradable goods and could affect the production plans of some sectors, such as the automotive industry. And on the demand side, early results from the March Decision Maker Panel suggested that around one third of companies viewed the invasion as one of the top three sources of uncertainty for their business, with an average negative impact across all firms of around 3% on sales expectations over the next twelve months. 27: The Chancellor of the Exchequer would present the Spring Statement to Parliament on 23 March, alongside updated Office for Budget Responsibility projections in its Economic and fiscal outlook. 28: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 5.5% in January, marginally above the February Monetary Policy Report forecast. This release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. 29: Taken together, energy and core goods inflation had accounted for over four fifths of the overshoot of CPI inflation relative to the 2% target in January. Food price inflation had strengthened further and accounted for much of the remainder of the overshoot. 30: The Governments Energy Bills Rebate, a package of support for households worth around  £9 billion, had been announced after the MPCs February meeting and the completion of the February Report projections. This package included a  £150 payment to most households via council tax bills in April, and a  £200 credit to households administered via electricity bills from October and repaid over the subsequent five-year period. The ONSs announcements on the treatment of these elements of this package in official consumer price measures were forthcoming. 31: CPI inflation was expected to rise to around 6% in February and March, before rising further, to around 8% in April, and remaining close to that rate for the rest of the quarter. The latter would be around 1 percentage point higher than expected in the February Report. The majority of this news could be attributed to energy prices. This included Ofgems announcement of slightly higher than expected increases in gas and electricity price caps in April, which were based on wholesale gas and electricity prices that pre-dated Russias invasion of Ukraine. In addition, recent increases in oil prices associated with the invasion were being reflected in prices of petrol and heating oil. Wholesale gas prices had been exceptionally volatile and the six-month observation window relevant for Ofgems October utility price cap calculation, which would run from February to the end of July, had only recently opened. If sustained, the latest rise in gas and electricity futures prices would mean that price caps, when reset in October 2022, could be around 35% higher, which would be around 20% higher than had been expected in the February Report. 32: Food price inflation was expected to rise further, from 4.3% in January, reflecting the pass-through of cost increases over recent months. Indicators of cost pressures further down the food supply chain had continued to rise. Following the invasion, agricultural commodity prices had increased sharply, which could put further upward pressure on input costs and food price inflation. 33: Core CPI inflation was expected to rise further, to around 5 to 5 ½% in 2022 Q2 accounted for largely by increases in core goods price inflation. Core goods inflation was expected to remain above its average during the previous decade. Services price inflation was projected to increase slightly, above recent historical averages. The overall near-term profile for core inflation was slightly higher than the expectation at the time of the February Report. Global supply chain disruptions posed an upside risk to the outlook for core goods price inflation. 34: Survey indicators of cost and price pressures had remained elevated. Both the IHS Markit/CIPS PMI composite input and output price measures had remained close to their historical highs. But these indicators pre-dated Russias invasion of Ukraine and were likely to understate the consequent cost pressures associated with the invasion. More timely intelligence from the Banks Agents contacts suggested that input prices had picked up further since late February, in particular for metals, grain and seed oils. 35: Since the MPCs previous meeting, households and businesses inflation expectations had risen further. Both the Bank/Ipsos and the Citi/YouGov surveys had reported a further rise in households short-term inflation expectations in 2022 Q1. The rise in the latter in March had been particularly pronounced, reaching its highest level since the survey had begun in late 2005. Changes in households short-term inflation expectations had typically corresponded with changes in spot inflation, especially developments in the prices of frequently purchased items, such as food, fuel and utilities. Medium-term measures of households inflation expectations had also increased further, though by less than their short-term counterparts. Nevertheless, the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure had matched its previous record high recorded in June 2011. 36: The Decision Maker Panel had reported a further increase in expectations for businesses year-ahead output price inflation, which had risen to 4.8% in the three months to February, and risen slightly further in the early March data particularly for those respondents who had viewed the invasion as the largest source of uncertainty for their businesses. The expectations of professional forecasters, reported in HM Treasurys February survey, had remained close to the inflation target of 2% at the two- to three-year ahead horizons. 37: The latest labour market indicators had continued to point to a tight and tightening labour market, which, alongside rising inflation, had contributed to strong pay growth. 38: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 3.9% in the three months to January, as had been expected at the time of the February Report. The LFS employment rate had been unchanged, with the inactivity rate rising slightly. Both developments had been broadly consistent with expectations at the time of the February Report. Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employee payrolls had risen strongly, by a further 275,000 in February, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat subsequently. 39: Indicators of labour demand had remained strong. The stock of vacancies in the three months to February had risen to 1.3 million, supplanting the record high set in the preceding three-month period. The REC permanent placements index had remained close to its record high in February. The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, a measure of labour market tightness, had remained above pre-Covid levels and had reached a new record high level. Intelligence from the Banks Agents suggested that elevated recruitment difficulties had persisted across most sectors and skill levels. The Agents contacts had reported high rates of job churn and vacancies, with little improvement in labour availability expected over the next year. 40: Private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) growth had risen to 4.1% in the three months to January on a year earlier, stronger than had been expected in the February Report. Bank staff estimated that workforce compositional effects had started to drag on headline pay growth recently. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the changes in workforce composition and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, Bank staff estimated that underlying private sector regular pay growth had remained at around 4 to 4 ½%, above pre-pandemic rates of around 3 to 3 ½%. The HMRC median of pay growth in February had been 3.7%, also above pre-pandemic rates. Looking ahead, the latest intelligence from the Banks Agents continued to point to higher pay settlements than a year ago, consistent with the Agents recent annual pay survey. 41: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 42: In the MPCs central projections in the February Monetary Policy Report, published before Russias invasion of Ukraine, UK GDP growth had been expected to slow to subdued rates during the course of this year. This had in large part reflected the adverse impact of the previous, already large, increases in global energy and tradable goods prices on UK real aggregate income and spending. As a result, a margin of spare capacity had been projected to open up and the unemployment rate had been expected to rise to 5% by 2025. CPI inflation had been expected to peak at around 7 ¼% in April 2022. Upward pressures on inflation had been expected to dissipate over time and, conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate expected at the time of the February Report and the MPCs current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation had been projected to fall back to a little above the 2% target in two years time and to below the target by a greater margin in three years. 43: The Committee reviewed recent economic news, against the backdrop of Russias invasion of Ukraine and related developments. 44: Based on available economic data for the period prior to the invasion, UK-weighted global GDP in 2022 Q1 was expected to grow by a little more than had been expected in the February Report, particularly in the euro area. Global consumer price inflation had risen further in February, to 5.8% in the euro area and to 7.9% in the United States. 45: The invasion had led to further large increases in energy and other commodity prices including food prices. It was also likely to exacerbate global supply chain disruptions, and had increased the uncertainty around the economic outlook significantly. Global inflationary pressures would strengthen considerably further over coming months, while growth in many of the United Kingdoms major trading partners, such as the euro area and other economies that were net energy importers, was likely to slow. 46: Gas prices in Europe had risen sharply following the invasion from already elevated levels, before declining again. The spot price of Brent oil had also been volatile and had increased to around $100 per barrel at the time of the MPCs meeting. Prices of metals and food had risen by around 15 and 20% respectively, and by a greater amount for those commodities of which Russia or Ukraine were major exporters. 47: Since the MPCs previous meeting, indicators of financial market volatility had increased and advanced economy risky asset prices had fallen. Longer-term advanced economy government bond yields had increased. 48: In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had risen, with market pricing consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points at this MPC meeting. The market-implied path for Bank Rate now reached around 2% by end-2022. 49: The Governments Energy Bills Rebate had been announced after the MPCs February meeting and the completion of the February Report projections. The ONSs announcements on the treatments of the elements of this package in consumer price statistics were forthcoming. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would present the Spring Statement to Parliament on 23 March, alongside updated Office for Budget Responsibility projections in its Economic and fiscal outlook. 50: The MPC had been briefed on initial reports from the Banks Agents and Decision Maker Panel on business sentiment following Russias invasion of Ukraine. But there was little evidence available yet on the impact of the invasion on UK economic activity. 51: UK GDP in January had been stronger than expected in the February Report. Bank staff now expected GDP to increase by around  ¾% in 2022 Q1, stronger than the February Report projection for a flat quarterly outturn. Business confidence had held up and labour market activity data had remained robust. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 3.9% in the three months to January, as expected at the time of the February Report. Her Majestys Revenue and Customs employee payrolls had risen strongly in February, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat subsequently. The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio had risen to another record high, and indicators of recruitment difficulties had remained elevated. Consumer confidence had, however, fallen in response to the squeeze on real household disposable incomes. Developments in the labour market were also likely to lag those in confidence and spending. 52: Due to recent developments, the impact of energy prices on real aggregate income was now likely to be materially larger than implied by the projections in the February Report, consistent with a weaker outlook for growth and employment, all else equal. The extent to which households reacted to the additional weakness in their real incomes by cutting their real spending or by reducing their savings would be important to monitor over coming quarters. The aggregate saving rate had already declined materially from its pandemic-driven peak over recent quarters, although it could fall below its pre-Covid level if some households were to run down the additional stock of savings built up during the pandemic. Developments in energy prices were likely to affect disproportionately households with lower incomes. Those households had not in general seen substantial rises in savings during the pandemic, however, which would limit the extent of any offset from a rundown of savings. It would also be important to monitor the extent to which higher uncertainty led to a reduction in business investment. 53: Underlying nominal earnings growth was estimated to have remained above pre-pandemic rates in the three months to January, and was higher than had been expected in the February Report. The latest intelligence from the Banks Agents continued to point to higher pay settlements than a year ago, consistent with the Agents recent annual pay survey. 54: Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 5.4% in December to 5.5% in January, which had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. Inflation was expected to increase further in coming months, to around 8% in 2022 Q2, around 1 percentage point higher than expected in the February Report. The majority of this news could be attributed to energy prices. The projected overshoot of inflation relative to the 2% target to an increasing extent reflected global energy prices, with some further material contribution from tradable goods prices. Service price inflation had also picked up, although to a lesser extent than other components, with the level of core services prices returning to their pre-Covid trend. Survey indicators of cost and price pressures had remained elevated. 55: If sustained, the latest rise in energy futures prices meant that Ofgems utility price caps could again be substantially higher when they were reset in October 2022. Wholesale prices had, however, been exceptionally volatile and the six-month observation window relevant for the October price cap calculation, which would run from February to the end of July, had only recently opened. Such movements could nevertheless temporarily push CPI inflation around the end of this year above the level projected for April, which had previously been expected to be the peak. Such an outturn could be several percentage points higher than had been expected in the February Report. In addition, continuing global supply chain disruptions posed an upside risk to the outlook for core goods inflation. 56: Further out, inflation was expected to fall back materially, and possibly to a greater extent than had been expected in the February Report, as energy prices stopped rising and as the squeeze on real incomes and demand put significant downward pressure on domestically generated inflation. The recent increase in the market-implied path of Bank Rate would also push down on demand and inflation in the medium term relative to the February Report, all else equal. The judgement that inflation would fall back also reflected that monetary policy would act to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were well anchored around the 2% target. 57: Since the MPCs previous meeting, financial market, household and business indicators of inflation expectations had risen. Medium-term UK inflation compensation measures in financial markets had increased further above their averages of the past decade. The Citi/YouGov measure of households five-to-ten year ahead expectations had matched its previous record high level. The Decision Maker Panel had reported a further increase in expectations for businesses year-ahead output price inflation. Nonetheless, the expectations of professional forecasters, had remained close to the 2% target at the two to three year ahead horizon. Overall, the MPC judged that inflation expectations remained well anchored at present. A risk to the inflation outlook was that wages and prices would not be set in a manner consistent with inflation returning to the 2% target in the medium term. The Committee would continue to monitor measures of inflation expectations very closely. 58: The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 59: The MPCs remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy had recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russias invasion of Ukraine was another such shock. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent, the very elevated levels of global energy and tradable goods prices, of which the United Kingdom was a net importer, would necessarily weigh further on UK real aggregate income and spending. This was something monetary policy was unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy was to ensure that, as this real economic adjustment occurred, it did so consistent with achieving the 2% CPI inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. 60: Given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures would persist, most members of the Committee judged that a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. UK activity had been somewhat stronger than had been expected at the time of the February Report and there had been indications that the current tightening in the labour market might not reverse direction as quickly as had been expected. The effects of Russias invasion of Ukraine would likely accentuate both the peak in inflation and the adverse impact on activity by intensifying the squeeze on household incomes. Monetary policy should be tightened at this meeting in order to reduce the risk that recent trends in nominal pay growth, domestic pricing, and inflation expectations strengthened and became embedded, and thereby to help to ensure inflation was at target sustainably in the medium term. 61: For one member of the Committee, it was appropriate to maintain the existing stance of monetary policy at this meeting. This member recognised the risk of second-round effects from a protracted period of high inflation and a tight labour market and that, as a consequence, further policy tightening might be warranted. This member, however, also placed great weight, at this point, on the very material negative impacts of higher commodity prices on real household incomes and activity. These appeared to have been exacerbated by Russias invasion of Ukraine. The invasion could also increase uncertainty and decrease consumer and business confidence. Such impacts on activity and employment would push against domestic inflationary pressures. For this member, the path of monetary policy would depend upon a fuller assessment than currently possible of the balance between these pressures, especially given current volatility in commodity markets. 62: Based on its current assessment of the economic situation, the Committee judged that some further modest tightening in monetary policy might be appropriate in the coming months, but there were risks on both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects for inflation evolved. The MPC would review developments in the light of incoming data and their implications for medium-term inflation, including the economic implications of recent geopolitical events, as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the May 2022 Monetary Policy Report. 63: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that: 64: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden, Michael Saunders and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the proposition. Jon Cunliffe voted against the proposition, preferring to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%. 65: As of 16 March 2022, and following the maturity of the March 2022 gilt previously held by the Asset Purchase Facility (APF), the total stock of assets held in the APF was  £867 billion, comprising  £847 billion of UK government bond purchases and  £20 billion of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. 66: The following members of the Committee were present: 67: As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Dorothy Thompson was also present on 8 March, and Bradley Fried and Dorothy Thompson were present on 11 March, as observers for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in their roles as members of the Banks Court of Directors. \n","20201217\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.   At its meeting ending on 16 December 2020, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.   The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%.   The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion.   The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with the programme of  £100 billion of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, and also to commence the previously announced programme of  £150 billion of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at  £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at  £895 billion. The MPCs central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report assumed that the pandemic would weigh on near-term spending to a greater extent than projected in the August Report, given new restrictions announced in October in response to rising virus cases.   They were also conditioned on the assumption that the United Kingdom, after leaving the Single Market and Customs Union on 1 January 2021, moved immediately to a free trade agreement with the European Union.   Conditional on those assumptions, UK GDP was projected to decline in 2020 Q4, and then pick up as restrictions were assumed to loosen.   Nonetheless, the unemployment rate was projected to rise markedly, consistent with a material degree of spare capacity, before declining gradually.   Conditioned on prevailing market yields, CPI inflation was expected to be around 2% in two years time. The main news since the November Report has been the successful trialling of some Covid vaccines and initial plans to roll them out widely over the first half of next year.   This is likely to reduce the downside risks to the economic outlook from Covid previously identified by the Committee.   Financial markets worldwide, and some surveys of businesses and consumers, have reacted positively to these developments which are likely to support future UK and global activity. Nevertheless, recent global activity has been affected by the increase in Covid cases and associated re-imposition of restrictions.   UK-weighted global GDP growth in 2020 Q4 is likely to be a little weaker than expected at the time of the November Report. The near-term UK outlook has evolved broadly in line with the Committees expectations in the November Report.   UK GDP grew by 0.4% in October, leaving it 8% below its level in 2019 Q4.   Activity has been stronger than expected, despite the recent rise in Covid cases and associated lockdowns.   Nevertheless, the restrictions on activity introduced after those lockdowns have been tighter than the Committee had assumed in its November forecast, and are expected to weigh more on activity in 2021 Q1.   The successful rollout of vaccines should support the gradual removal of restrictions and rebound in activity that was assumed in the November Report, although it is less clear how this prospect will affect the immediate economic behaviour of households and businesses.   The additional fiscal measures in Spending Review 2020 are likely to boost GDP by an estimated peak of over 1% during 2021-22. Developments in the labour market have remained difficult to interpret.   The LFS unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, but other indicators suggest that labour market slack has increased by more than implied by this measure.   The extension of the governments employment support schemes is likely to limit significantly the near-term rise in unemployment, although a substantial further increase is still likely over the next few quarters. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 0.3% in November, from 0.7% in October, triggering the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor published alongside this monetary policy announcement.   The weakness of recent outturns largely reflects the direct and indirect effects of Covid on the economy.   CPI inflation is expected to rise quite sharply towards the target in the spring, as the VAT cut comes to an end and the large fall in energy prices earlier this year drops out of the annual comparison. The outlook for the economy remains unusually uncertain.   It depends on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, as well as the nature of, and transition to, the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom.   It will also depend on the responses of households, businesses and financial markets to these developments. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely.   If the outlook for inflation weakens, the Committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit.   The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. \n","20190502\n","The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The Committees updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying May Inflation Report. They assume a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdoms eventual trading relationship with the European Union. They are also conditioned on a path for Bank Rate that rises to around 1% by the end of the forecast period, lower than in the February Report. As with UK financial conditions more generally, that path has been heavily influenced by recent global developments, with forward interest rates in the United States and the euro area falling markedly.  The MPC has noted previously that UK data could be unusually volatile in the near term, due to shifting expectations about Brexit in financial markets and among households and businesses. GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5% in 2019 Q1, in part reflecting a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2% in Q2. Smoothing through those developments, the underlying pace of GDP growth appears to be slightly stronger than previously anticipated, but marginally below potential. That subdued pace reflects the impact of the slowdown in global growth and ongoing Brexit uncertainties. The latter is having a particularly pronounced impact on business investment, which has been falling for a year. The MPC judges that there is currently a small margin of excess supply in the economy.          In the MPCs central projection, global growth stabilises around its potential rate and Brexit uncertainties subside gradually. Four-quarter UK GDP growth begins to pick up next year and rises to over 2% by the end of the forecast period. Business investment recovers and household spending continues to support demand growth, sustained by rising real incomes. GDP growth picks up above the subdued pace of potential supply growth, such that excess demand begins to build.   Excess demand rises above 1% of potential output by the end of the forecast period, notably higher than in the February Report, reflecting the support to demand provided by lower market interest rates and easier financial conditions more generally. CPI inflation was 1.9% in March and is expected to be slightly further below the MPCs 2% target during the first half of the forecast period, largely reflecting lower expected retail energy prices. The labour market remains tight, with the unemployment rate projected to decline to 3 ½% by the end of the forecast period. Annual pay growth has remained around 3 ½% and unit labour cost growth has strengthened to rates that are above historical averages. As excess demand emerges, domestic inflationary pressures are expected to firm, such that CPI inflation picks up to above the 2% target in two years time and is still rising at the end of the three-year forecast period.       The Committee continues to judge that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with its Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon. The MPC judges at this meeting that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate.    The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.   The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of these effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. The Committee will always act to achieve the 2% inflation target. Monetary policy summary and minutes Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20200618\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge at present is to respond to the severe economic and financial disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19.   At its meeting ending on 17 June 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with the existing programme of  £200 billion of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. The Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 for the Bank of England to increase the target stock of purchased UK government bonds, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by an additional  £100 billion, to take the total stock of asset purchases to  £745 billion. Risky asset prices have recovered further from their March lows, although they have remained sensitive to news on the evolution of the pandemic.   Recent data outturns suggest that the fall in global GDP in 2020 Q2 will be less severe than expected at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report. There are signs of consumer spending and services output picking up, following the easing of Covid-related restrictions on economic activity. Recent additional announcements of easier monetary and fiscal policy will help to support the recovery. Downside risks to the global outlook remain, however, including from the spread of Covid-19 within emerging market economies and from a return to a higher rate of infection in advanced economies. UK GDP contracted by around 20% in April, following a 6% fall in March. Evidence from more timely indicators suggests that GDP started to recover thereafter. Payments data are consistent with a recovery in consumer spending in May and June, and housing activity has started to pick up recently. The LFS unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.9% in the three months to April. But other and more timely indications from the claimant count, HMRC payrolls data and job vacancies suggest that the labour market has weakened materially. Following stronger than expected take-up of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, a greater number of workers are likely to be furloughed in the second quarter. Evidence from business surveys and the Banks Agents is consistent with a weak outlook for employment in coming quarters. Some households are also worried about their job security. Twelve-month CPI inflation declined from 1.5% in March to 0.8% in April, triggering the explanatory letter from the Governor to the Chancellor published alongside this monetary policy announcement. CPI inflation fell further in May, to 0.5%. Current below-target rates of CPI inflation can in large part be accounted for by the effects of the pandemic. The collapse in global oil prices has had direct effects on inflation, via the prices of motor fuels, and indirect effects by reducing input costs in other sectors of the economy. The sharp drop in domestic activity is also adding to downward pressure on inflation through increased spare capacity in most sectors of the economy. The unprecedented situation means that the outlook for the UK and global economies is unusually uncertain. It will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how governments, households and businesses respond to these factors. The emerging evidence suggests that the fall in global and UK GDP in 2020 Q2 will be less severe than set out in the May Report. Although stronger than expected, it is difficult to make a clear inference from that about the recovery thereafter. There is a risk of higher and more persistent unemployment in the United Kingdom. Even with the relaxation of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is likely to persist. The economy, and especially the labour market, will therefore take some time to recover towards its previous path. CPI inflation is well below the 2% target and is expected to fall further below it in coming quarters, largely reflecting the weakness of demand. At this meeting, the MPC judges that a further easing of monetary policy is warranted to meet its statutory objectives. The Committee agreed to increase the target stock of purchased UK government bonds by an additional  £100 billion in order to meet the inflation target in the medium term. The Committee expects that programme to be completed, and the total stock of asset purchases to reach  £745 billion, around the turn of the year. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely and, consistent with its remit, stands ready to take further action as necessary to support the economy and ensure a sustained return of inflation to the 2% target. The Committee will keep the asset purchase programme under review. \n","20211104\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 2 November 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. The MPC voted by a majority of 7-2 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion. The Committee voted by a majority of 6-3 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at  £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at  £895 The Committees updated central projections for activity and inflation are set out in the Monetary Policy Report. The projections are conditioned on asset and energy prices averaged over the 15 days to 27 October. This gives a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises to around 1% by the end of 2022. Wholesale energy prices are assumed to be based on their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain flat beyond that. There are material risks around this Both global and UK GDP increased in 2021 Q3, although at a slower pace than projected in the August Report. Growth is somewhat restrained by disruption in supply chains. Alongside the rapid pace at which global demand for goods has risen, this has led to supply bottlenecks in certain sectors. There have also been some signs of weaker UK consumption demand. While bottlenecks will continue to restrain growth somewhat in the near term, global and UK GDP are nonetheless expected to recover further from the effects of Covid-19 (Covid). UK GDP is projected to get back to its 2019 Q4 level in 2022 Q1. Over the second half of the forecast period, and conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, UK GDP growth is expected to be relatively subdued. The pace of growth slows as potential supply growth eases back towards pre-Covid rates, and as higher energy prices and the fading of monetary and fiscal policy support temper demand growth. At the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021, the Government announced a higher path for government consumption, particularly over the next couple of years. By the end of the forecast period, a margin of spare capacity is expected to emerge. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 4.5% in the three months to August, while Her Majestys Revenue and Customs payroll data have continued to rise strongly. Just over a million jobs are likely to have been furloughed immediately before the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme closed at end-September, significantly more than expected in the August Report. Nonetheless, there have continued to be few signs of increases in redundancies and the stock of vacancies has increased further, as have indicators of recruitment difficulties. Taken together, while there is considerable uncertainty, initial indicators suggest that unemployment will rise slightly in 2021 Q4. Bank staffs estimate of underlying pay growth has remained above pre-pandemic rates, although pay growth is expected to fall back from its current rate in the November Report central projections. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell slightly from 3.2% in August to 3.1% in September. Bank staff expect inflation to rise to just under 4% in October, accounted for predominantly by the impact on utility bills of past strength in wholesale gas prices. CPI inflation is then expected to rise to 4 ½% in November and remain around that level through the winter, accounted for by further increases in core goods and food price inflation. Wholesale gas prices have risen sharply since August. CPI inflation is now expected to peak at around 5% in April 2022, materially higher than expected in the August Report. The upward pressure on CPI inflation is expected to dissipate over time, as supply disruption eases, global demand rebalances, and energy prices stop rising. As a result, CPI inflation is projected to fall back materially from the second half of next year. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPCs current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation is projected to be a little above the 2% target in two years time and just below the target at the end of the forecast period. In an alternative scenario that is conditioned on energy prices following forward curves throughout the forecast period and as set out in the November Report, CPI inflation falls back towards the target more rapidly than in the MPCs central projection, and is materially lower over the second half of the forecast period. The MPCs remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy has been subject to very large shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, will as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. At its recent meetings, the Committee has judged that some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to meet the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term. The latest developments, set alongside the Committees updated projections, reinforce this view. Nevertheless, near-term uncertainties remain, especially around the outlook for the labour market, and the extent to which domestic cost and price pressures persist into the medium term. At this meeting, the Committee concluded that the existing stance of monetary policy remained The Committee judges that, provided the incoming data, particularly on the labour market, are broadly in line with the central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report, it will be necessary over coming months to increase Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2% target. In observing the market-implied path for Bank Rate, the Committee notes that, in the November Monetary Policy Report central projections, CPI inflation is projected to be below the 2% target at the end of the forecast period, and would probably fall a little further beyond that point, given the margin of spare capacity that is expected to emerge. Looking beyond the coming months, the Committee will, as always, continue to focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The Committee judges that there are two-sided risks around developments in the economy in the medium term, and will reach its assessment on the balance of these risks in light of the relevant data as they emerge. 1) Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. 2) UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have risen by 1.2% in 2021 Q3, a little weaker than had been expected in the August Monetary Policy Report. This weaker growth had been accounted for by slower-than-expected growth in the United States and China, partly offset by strength in the euro area. Global GDP was expected to expand at a slower pace in Q4 than had been anticipated in the August Report, in part reflecting supply chain disruptions, which had continued to weigh on global activity. Bottlenecks, stemming from supply disruptions and the pattern of global demand, as well as rising energy prices, had continued to increase global cost pressures. 3) Supply chain bottlenecks over recent months had reflected both strong demand for consumer goods in advanced economies, in particular in the United States, and further supply disruptions from localised lockdowns at some major Chinese ports and Covid-related closures of factories in other Asian economies. Estimates of supply constraints constructed by Bank staff, derived from a range of PMIs such as delivery times and stocks of finished goods, had remained elevated since the MPCs previous meeting. There had been some signs that demand had begun to rotate away from goods and back towards services. That had been most apparent in the United States where durables consumption had 4) According to the preliminary flash estimate, euro-area GDP had grown by 2.2% in 2021 Q3. This was stronger than had been expected in the August Report, and had left the level of GDP 0.5% below that in 2019 Q4. The upside news had reflected, in part, a smaller-than-expected drag on activity from the spread of the Delta variant. Euro-area GDP growth was expected to be just under 1% in Q4. According to the flash estimate, the euro-area composite output PMI had decreased by 1.9 points in October, to 54.3, with both the services and manufacturing indices decreasing. 5) According to the Advance estimate, US GDP had increased by 0.5% in 2021 Q3. This was weaker than expected at the time of the August Report, but had left the level of GDP around 1 ½% higher than in 2019 Q4. Within this, household spending had risen by 0.4%, with spending on goods falling but services consumption continuing to rise. More recent high-frequency spending data suggested that social spending, such as on restaurants and recreation, had continued to recover. In the labour market, non-farm payrolls had increased by 194,000 in September, a much slower pace than had been expected by financial markets. The unemployment rate had nevertheless fallen to 4.8% in September, from 5.2% in August, and the level of job vacancies had remained high. US GDP growth was expected to be around 1% in Q4. 6) In China, GDP had increased by 0.2% in 2021 Q3, lower than had been expected at the time of the August Report. This downside news had reflected the impact of local Covid outbreaks on consumption and services activity, power shortages and a rapid slowdown in housing activity. Further stresses in the property market more recently were likely to weigh on activity in the near term. 7) Global inflationary pressures had remained strong since the MPCs previous meeting. Wholesale gas prices had continued to rise in Europe and Asia, reflecting strong demand, although they had fallen back at the end of October. The Brent oil spot price had risen further and was now around $85 per barrel. Non-energy commodity prices had also increased. Shipping costs had remained elevated, particularly for routes connecting Asia with the United States and with Europe. Survey indicators of manufacturing input and output prices had continued to rise in October in a number of advanced economies. Global cost pressures were expected to dissipate over time as supply disruption eased, global demand rebalanced and energy prices stopped rising. 8) Cost pressures had continued to pass through to consumer prices in the euro area and in the United States. Euro-area HICP inflation had increased to 4.1% in October, its highest rate since 2008, and there had also been an increase in core inflation, which had risen to 2.1%. In the United States, core PCE inflation had remained at 3.6% in September, and the headline measure had risen to 4.4%. 9) There had been some sizable movements in UK and global financial markets since the Committees previous meeting. In part that had reflected the impact of supply chain bottlenecks and sharp rises in energy prices on market participants outlook for global inflation and growth, and perceptions of 10) Advanced-economy longer-term government bond yields had risen by around 20 to 30 basis points since the MPCs September meeting, in large part reflecting an increase in the inflation compensation component of nominal interest rates. Ten-year bond yields had now mostly reversed the declines seen over the summer and, in the United Kingdom, had exceeded the levels seen immediately 11) Since the Committees previous meeting, short-term market measures of inflation compensation had risen sharply across advanced economies, including in the United Kingdom. Market contacts had reported that these increases had largely reflected strength in CPI inflation data, developments in energy prices and supply chain bottlenecks. Medium-term measures of advanced-economy inflation compensation had also continued to rise for much of the period since the Committees last meeting. In both the United States and the euro area, these measures were now around their average levels over the past decade. In the United Kingdom, medium-term inflation compensation measures had remained above their post-2008 average levels. 12) Interpreting UK medium-term inflation compensation measures was not straightforward. UK inflation markets were used for hedging large pension liabilities, which could cause shifts in inflation compensation over and above those driven by changes in inflation expectations and perceived inflation risks. Inferences from UK measures, which were based on RPI inflation, about market expectations for CPI inflation were further complicated by the uncertain future wedge between consumer price and RPI inflation. The interpretation of some medium-term measures, including the five-year inflation swap rate, five years forward, was also affected by uncertainty around the planned alignment of the RPI with CPIH in 2030. All else equal, this alignment would push down levels of inflation compensation beyond that point, relative to prices in the past. It was therefore useful to consider a range of inflation compensation measures, including those with reference maturities prior to 2030, such as the three-year inflation swap rate, five years forward. Despite these difficulties in interpretation, models that attempted to extract medium-term market expectations for CPI inflation, and intelligence gathered from market contacts, suggested that higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks to inflation might have in part accounted for the above-average levels of medium-term inflation compensation measures, alongside other factors. The Committees overall assessment of medium-term inflation expectations was set out in Box 13) At its 22 September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had left unchanged its target range for the federal funds rate. The pace of asset purchases had also been left unchanged, but the FOMC had noted that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases might soon be warranted. In their updated Summary of Economic Projections, FOMC participants had revised up their projections for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate, with the median now rising to 1% in 2023. At its 27 October meeting, the Bank of Canada had left its policy rate unchanged and had ceased its asset purchase programme, moving into a reinvestment phase during which purchases would be made solely to replace maturing bonds. At its meeting on 28 October, the ECB Governing Council had left its key policy interest rates unchanged and had made no significant changes to its asset purchase programmes. On 2 November, the Reserve Bank of Australia had maintained the target for its cash rate, had continued its asset purchase programme and had discontinued its target for the yield on the April 2024 bond. Both the Norges Bank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had increased policy rates by 25 basis points at their most recent meetings. 14) Across advanced economies, the paths for market-implied policy rates had risen since the Committees previous meeting. At the three-year horizon, the market-implied policy rate had risen by around 30 to 40 basis points in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom. Global interest rate markets had been volatile most recently, in part reflecting diminished market 15) In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had increased sharply since the MPCs September meeting, which appeared to reflect market participants perceptions of a further rise in inflationary pressures and recent MPC communications about the policy outlook. Most market contacts were expecting the Committee to raise Bank Rate to 0.25% by the end of the year, with expectations for the exact timing finely balanced between the November and December MPC meetings. The November Report was conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate, based on the 15-working day average to 27 October, that rose to around 1% by the end of 2022. In the immediate run-up to the MPCs November meeting, the market-implied path for Bank Rate had reached around 1.3% by the end of next year. Market contacts had noted that diminished market liquidity meant that it had become more difficult to infer a central path for Bank Rate 16) The sterling effective exchange rate index had risen by around 1% since the previous MPC meeting. 17) In contrast to movements in advanced-economy government bond markets, there had been relatively little news in corporate financing conditions. Advanced-economy equity prices had risen since the Committees previous meeting, in part supported by strong earnings, and corporate bond spreads had remained at historically low levels. In the United Kingdom, bank credit conditions for corporates 18) Lending rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios higher than 75% had continued to fall since the September meeting, despite the increases in risk-free rates. The associated relatively sharp narrowing in mortgage spreads was in part likely to reflect the typical lagged response of mortgage rates to movements in risk-free rates, and so, all else equal, this effect would be expected to reverse to some extent. Perhaps consistent with that, there had been a rise in lending rates on some mortgage products with LTV ratios at or below 75% recently. The latest Credit Conditions Survey had suggested that unsecured credit conditions for households had continued to 19) UK quarterly GDP growth in 2021 Q2 had been revised up to 5.5% in the Quarterly National Accounts (QNA). Estimates of GDP had also been revised higher in preceding quarters, such that the cumulative shortfall in activity since 2019 Q4 was estimated to have been 3.3%, contrasting with an initial estimate of 4.4% and the 4.3% that had been implied in the August 20) The QNA had been aligned with Blue Book 2021, which had included significant methodological changes such as the introduction of double deflation and improvements to deflators for items such as telecommunications and clothing. Reflecting these changes, the contributions of manufacturing and telecoms services to GDP growth had been revised up significantly over recent decades, with largely offsetting revisions to contributions from other sectors such as financial services. Overall, GDP growth was now estimated to have been slightly lower on average in the years leading up to the financial crisis, and slightly higher on average in the subsequent years, most notably between 2016 21) UK GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.4% in August, following a 0.1% fall in July, with activity slightly weaker than expected at the time of the August Report despite the upward revisions to preceding quarters. Much of the upside news in earlier months had been in government services output, and the health sector in particular, where activity had subsequently fallen back in July and August. Manufacturing and construction activity had also weakened since the spring, with output in these sectors around 2% below pre-Covid levels in August. Output in business, and transport and work-related, services had continued to recover, albeit at a more modest pace than had been anticipated. Activity in other consumer-facing services had recovered strongly and by slightly more than had been expected, however. Output in some sub-sectors, such as accommodation and food services, had been at or around pre-Covid levels, although activity in other sub-sectors, such as arts and recreation, had continued to lag further behind pre-pandemic levels. 22) Much of the downside news since the August Report had appeared to reflect the impact of supply chain disruption, particularly for businesses in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Supplier delivery times in those particular sectors had continued to lengthen according to the latest PMI surveys, which had also shown stocks of manufactured goods being at historically low levels and backlogs of work at around historical highs. Rates of outstanding business had also continued to rise for services companies, albeit to a lesser degree. 23) The Banks Agents had reported that shortages of materials and labour had weighed on output across a wide range of businesses, and that some businesses expected supply issues for certain products to persist until at least late-2022. According to the latest ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey, the production or supply chains of around 11% of trading businesses had been affected by the recent sharp increases in gas prices. Consistent with supply disruption continuing, almost two thirds of respondents to the latest CBI Industrial Trends survey had reported that a lack of materials or components were expected to be a factor limiting production over the next three months, and 40% of respondents had cited shortages of skilled labour as a potential limiting factor, with both series at their highest levels since the mid-1970s. 24) High-frequency indicators suggested that consumer spending had recovered further since the summer, but at a more modest pace than had been anticipated at the time of the August Report. A pick-up had been most discernible in those components where shortfalls had originally been the largest, including public transport journeys, flights and cinema visits. Retail sales volumes had fallen in September for the fifth month in a row and by around 5% from their peak in April, although sales volumes had remained around 4% above their 2019 Q4 average. The declines had in part reflected a substitution away from spending on goods back towards services, which Bank staff anticipated could persist for a period as spending continued to converge towards its pre-Covid pattern. Goods spending might have also been dampened by product shortages, with some Agents contacts reporting lost sales for products such as electrical goods and furniture, and a continued shortage of new cars for sale in particular. The perception of possible disruption to supply had prompted a burst of spending on motor fuels in late September, and subsequent shortages until additional supplies had been delivered, with spending on fuel being lower than usual thereafter. 25) Indicators of confidence among UK households had fallen in recent weeks, and by more than had been seen in other economies. The number of Covid cases had remained relatively high in the United Kingdom, but, unlike other swings in confidence over the recent past, the latest changes had appeared to reflect non-health factors. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey had shown a further decline in the share of adults expressing worries around Covid in the first half of October, although around two fifths of respondents had remained concerned. The softening in consumer confidence might have instead reflected idiosyncratic factors, such as the recent fuel shortages, or recent or prospective changes in individuals real incomes. In addition to increases in inflation, largely associated with higher energy costs, some households had been affected by the withdrawal of fiscal measures to support the economy during the Covid crisis, such as the removal of the temporary  £20 per week uplift to Universal Credit at the end of September. The September Bank of England/NMG household survey had continued to show that households in aggregate were expecting to increase their spending over the next three months, but that those on relatively low incomes were still expecting to reduce their spending. There had also been declines in the share of households anticipating a return to pre-Covid levels of spending by the end of this year or by the middle of 2022. 26) Businesses investment intentions over the year ahead had remained robust, although to a lesser degree in the near term. Business investment had risen by 4.5% in 2021 Q2, but was still around 13% below its 2019 Q4 level. The October Decision Maker Panel had continued to report that the drag from Covid on business investment was lessening over time, but more gradually than had been anticipated in July, with investment in 2021 Q4 expected to be around 7% lower than it would otherwise have been. Some contacts of the Banks Agents had reported investment having been held back by shortages of equipment and skilled labour. Nevertheless, the Agents special survey of investment intentions had indicated a strong rebound in spending over the next twelve months, particularly among consumer services firms. Businesses had generally looked to reinstate investment plans that had been put on hold, or had been considering other new projects that were perceived as being lower risk, as part of a desire to increase efficiency and productivity, and to improve digital capabilities. 27) Overall, GDP was expected to grow by around 1.5% in 2021 Q3 and by 1% in Q4 in the November Report projections, around half of the rates envisaged in the August Report. As a result, GDP was expected to remain below its pre-Covid level until 2022 Q1. While this downward revision had mainly reflected supply chain disruption, a more modest recovery in consumer demand in particular had also 28) At the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021, the Government had announced significant increases in public services spending alongside other tax and welfare changes. These increases in spending were in addition to the higher health and social care spending announced in September alongside the new Health and Social Care Levy. Bank staff had estimated that the fiscal policies announced since the August Report would boost GDP by just over  ½% at their peak in fiscal year 2023-24. 29) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 4.5% in the three months to August, 0.3 percentage points lower than had been expected at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report. The jobless rate had remained above its 2019 Q4 level, however, with that increase almost entirely accounted for by those that had been unemployed for six months or longer. LFS employment had risen by 0.7% in the three months to August, to 1.6% below its 2019 Q4 level, with that shortfall more than accounted for by lower self employment. Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employee payrolls had risen by 210,000 in the single month of September, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat. The increase in the total number of payroll employees compared to its pre-pandemic level had been more than accounted for by a sustained increase in workers in the health, education and public administration sector over the past year. In contrast, the number of employees in consumer-facing services had remained some way below pre-Covid 30) The LFS inactivity rate had fallen slightly in the three months to August, accounted for largely by a fall in inactive students and discouraged workers, but was still around 1 percentage point higher than immediately prior to the pandemic. Average hours worked had continued to increase in the three months to August, as those on furlough had increasingly returned to work, and were now only a little below their 2019 Q4 level. 31) According to HMRC administrative data, around 1.4 million jobs, just over 5 ½% of private sector jobs, had been furloughed on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) in August, compared to around 1.7 million jobs furloughed in July. This had been in line with estimates derived from the ONSs Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS), but was more than double the assumption incorporated in the August Report. Fully furloughed jobs had accounted for 55% of the total number of jobs furloughed in August. Smaller firms with less than 10 employees had accounted for around half of furloughed jobs. The latest BICS data suggested that the share of private sector jobs furloughed had fallen to 4 ½%, or around 1.1 million jobs, in the final ten days of the CJRS at the 32) There was so far little evidence that the end of the CJRS had led to a significant increase in unemployment, although there remained uncertainty around the outlook. Indicators of redundancies had remained subdued, including the latest BICS data on planned redundancies by small businesses over the next three months. The Banks Agents had not picked up reports of widespread layoffs, and some larger companies in sectors where demand was still weak had reported that they were likely to continue to retain staff in anticipation of a recovery. 33) Indicators of employment demand and labour market tightness had remained elevated. The stock of job vacancies recorded by the ONS had reached another record high of 1.1 million in the three months to September, and the strength had been relatively broad-based across sectors and by firm size. The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had also reached its highest level since a consistent series had been available in 2001. Higher frequency indicators of the number of online vacancies had risen further in October. The REC staff availability indices had remained at historically very low levels. Companies across a wide range of sectors had reported an increase in hiring intentions to the Banks Agents. At the same time, staff turnover had picked up and recruitment difficulties had become more broad based, with companies reporting acute shortages in a range of occupations. The Agents score for companies staff recruitment difficulties was at its highest level since the series had begun in 34) Private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had risen by 6.8% in the three months to August on a year earlier, broadly in line with expectations at the time of the August Report. Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the CJRS and changes in composition, Bank staff estimated that private sector regular pay growth had risen to around 4 ½%, above pre-pandemic rates of around 3 ½%. The REC permanent staff salaries index, which measured the monthly pay growth of new permanent hires, had increased to another record high in September, with respondents to the survey noting greater competition for workers and that some job candidates had been able to successfully negotiate 35) Median whole-economy employment-weighted annual basic pay growth in the Banks pay settlements database had remained at 3% over recent months, slightly higher than in 2020 and compared with growth of 2% in 2019. That was broadly consistent with pay settlements reported to the Banks Agents, which had continued to increase as the labour market had tightened. Within the aggregate reports, there had been a rising number of targeted pay awards in excess of 5%, to compensate workers for pay freezes during the pandemic or to retain staff with skills in particularly high demand. Recent trends in settlements were difficult to determine with precision, given the seasonality of pay negotiations and the relatively low numbers of settlements included in early 36) The Government had announced at the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021 that the National Living Wage for those aged over 23 would rise by 6.6% from April 2022, with large rises in the National Minimum Wage for younger workers as well. The temporary pause in public sector pay progression introduced in November 2020 had also been lifted, with pay awards to be determined after independent pay review bodies made their recommendations ahead of next April. 37) Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen slightly, from 3.2% in August to 3.1% in September. Core inflation, excluding food, beverages, tobacco and energy, had also declined, from 3.1% to 2.9%. Both of these outturns had been broadly in line with expectations at the time of the August Report. Within the components, core goods inflation had remained at an eleven-year high of 3.3%. Services inflation had fallen to 2.6%, largely reflecting the unwind of the boost to inflation in August from last years Eat Out to Help Out scheme. 38) Bank staff expected CPI inflation to rise to just under 4% in October, accounted for predominantly by the impact on utility price inflation of previously announced increases in Ofgems standard variable tariff caps on gas and electricity prices. CPI inflation was expected to rise to 4 ½% in November and remain around that level through the winter, accounted for by further increases in core goods and food price inflation. 39) Most survey indicators of costs and prices were at historically elevated levels. Food input costs had risen materially, while core manufacturing producer output price inflation had reached its highest level since 2008 in September. Services producer price inflation had increased to 3.6% in 2021 Q3, from 2.0% in Q2, also the highest rate since 2008. Some of that strength had been due to components related to freight and support services, and could partly reflect recent congestion at some ports. The flash composite input and output price PMIs had risen to record highs in October, with contacts attributing those movements to supply shortages, rising fuel, transport and energy bills, and stronger wage pressures. The Banks Agents had also reported that increased costs were being passed through to output and retail prices to a greater extent than previously. 40) At the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021, the government had announced a number of changes to excise duties, including a major reform of the alcohol duty regime and a freezing of duties for one year from February 2022, and a freezing of fuel duties for one year from April 2022. Taken together, these announcements represented around 0.1 percentage points of downside news to Bank 41) Wholesale gas prices had continued to rise sharply since the September MPC meeting, although they had fallen back at the very end of October. The rises in gas and electricity futures prices suggested that Ofgems retail price caps would increase materially further from April 2022. Taking account of this, CPI inflation was expected to pick up to close to 5% in 2022 Q2, around 1 percentage point higher than had been expected in the August Report. Ofgem had announced recently that it would consult on its price cap methodology ahead of determining the energy price caps in 42) Since the MPCs previous meeting, the Citi/YouGov measure of household inflation expectations for the year ahead had risen from 4.1% in September to 4.4% in October, its highest level since 2008. The five-to-ten year ahead measure had fallen slightly to 3.7%, after rising sharply in September. In common with other business survey indicators of companies own pricing intentions, the Decision Maker Panel series on expected price growth over the next twelve months was at elevated levels, and had risen sharply in October. Responses to questions in the CBI Distributive Trades survey on the expected change in the general level of prices in the markets in which firms compete, over the next year and two years, were broadly in line with past averages, however. Professional forecasters expected CPI inflation to be close to target in the medium term. 43) The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain 44) The Committee reviewed recent developments against the backdrop of its latest economic projections as set out in the accompanying November Monetary Policy Report. The projections were conditioned on asset and energy prices averaged over the 15 working days to 27 October. This gave a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rose to around 1% by the end of 2022. Wholesale energy prices were assumed to be based on their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain flat beyond that. There were material risks around this assumption. 45) UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have risen by 1.2% in 2021 Q3, a little weaker than had been expected in the August Report. This had been accounted for by slower-than-expected growth in the United States and China, partly offset by strength in the euro area. Growth was somewhat restrained by disruption in supply chains. Alongside the rapid pace at which global demand for goods had risen, this had led to supply bottlenecks in certain sectors. Fiscal stimulus, particularly in the United States, had continued to boost materially consumers demand for durable goods, although to a lesser extent than earlier in the year. Supply disruptions from localised lockdowns at some major Chinese ports and Covid-related closures of factories in other Asian economies had weighed on 46) Global GDP in 2021 Q4 was also expected to expand at a slower pace than had been anticipated in the August Report. Supply and demand imbalances were expected to ease over 2022 in the November Report projections, reflecting a continued rotation of demand back towards services in advanced economies, and a dissipation of supply disruptions. 47) Supply chain bottlenecks and rising energy prices had continued to increase global cost pressures. Wholesale gas prices had risen further in Europe and Asia, as had the Brent oil price, and shipping costs had remained elevated. In the November Report projections, world export prices excluding fuels were projected to rise by around 6% in 2021 as a whole. Export price inflation was then expected to fall back, as bottlenecks eased relatively gradually, energy prices stopped rising 48) There had been some sizable movements in UK and global financial markets since the Committees previous meeting. Advanced-economy longer-term government bond yields had increased, in large part reflecting an increase in the inflation compensation component of nominal interest rates. Advanced-economy equity prices had risen, while corporate bond spreads had remained at historically 49) Market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had increased sharply since the MPCs September meeting, although a deterioration in liquidity conditions meant that it had become more difficult to infer a central path for policy expectations. Most market contacts were expecting the Committee to increase Bank Rate to 0.25% by the end of this year, with expectations for the exact timing finely balanced between the November and December meetings. 50) As of 2 November 2021, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility had reached  £871 billion, including  £127 billion of the  £150 billion programme of UK government bond purchases announced on 5 November 2020. 51) In 2021 Q2, the cumulative shortfall in UK GDP since 2019 Q4 was estimated to have been 3.3%, compared with the 4.3% that had been expected in the August Report projection. GDP was expected to grow by around 1.5% in 2021 Q3 and by 1% in Q4 in the November Report projections, around half of the rates envisaged in the August Report. While these downward revisions had mainly reflected supply chain disruption, a more modest recovery in consumer demand had also been a contributing factor. Retail sales volumes had fallen in September for the fifth month in a row, and consumer confidence had fallen in recent weeks. UK GDP was now projected to get back to its 2019 Q4 level in 2022 Q1. 52) At the Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021, the Government had announced a higher path for government consumption, particularly over the next couple of years. These increases in spending were in addition to the higher health and social care spending announced in September alongside the new Health and Social Care Levy. Bank staff had estimated that the fiscal policies announced since the August Report would boost GDP by just over  ½% at their peak in fiscal year 2023-24. 53) Over the second half of the forecast period, and conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, UK GDP growth was expected to be relatively subdued. The pace of growth slowed as potential supply growth was expected to ease back towards pre-Covid rates, and as higher energy prices and the fading of monetary and fiscal policy support tempered demand growth. Consumption growth was expected to slow over the forecast period, in part reflecting the drag on real incomes from higher energy prices. Government spending growth was also expected to fall back, as the fiscal policy stance tightened gradually over time in line with announced government policy. Business investment was projected to rise over the first half of the forecast period as sales recovered and uncertainty declined, and was supported by the Governments capital allowance super-deduction, before falling 54) Following its latest stocktake of the supply side of the economy and as set out in detail in the November Report, the Committee expected potential supply to be around 1% lower by the end of the forecast period than in August. That partly reflected an updated assessment of the impact of demographic trends on potential participation and average hours, as well as a weaker expected path for business investment, which weighed on the growth of capital and total factor productivity. 55) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 4.5% in the three months to August, while Her Majestys Revenue and Customs payroll data had continued to rise strongly. The total number of payroll employees was now estimated to be above its 2019 Q4 level, more than accounted for by a sustained increase in workers in the health, education and public administration sector over the past year. Nevertheless, LFS employment in the three months to August had been around 1 ½% below its pre-pandemic level, reflecting lower self employment. With measured GDP also still some way below its pre-Covid level, whole-economy labour productivity had been weak. Focusing on market-sector GDP and employment data, the average level of productivity was expected to be marginally higher by the end of the year compared to 2019 Q4. 56) The LFS inactivity rate had fallen slightly in the three months to August, but was still around 1 percentage point higher than immediately prior to the pandemic. 57) Just over a million jobs were likely to have been furloughed immediately before the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) closed at end-September, significantly more than had been expected in the August Report. Nonetheless, there had continued to be few signs of increases in redundancies and the stock of vacancies had increased further, as had indicators of recruitment difficulties. Taken together, while there was considerable uncertainty, initial indicators suggested that unemployment would rise slightly in 2021 Q4. Official labour market figures for October, the first set of LFS data covering the period following the closure of the CJRS, would be published ahead of the December MPC meeting, with further official data for 2021 Q4 published thereafter. It would be important to monitor developments in self employment and any signs of increased bankruptcies among small and 58) There was significant uncertainty about the degree of slack in the economy, although it was judged likely that there was a small margin of excess demand currently. Over 2022 and 2023, excess demand was expected to be eroded, as demand growth slowed by more than supply growth. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate, a margin of spare capacity was expected to emerge by the end of the forecast period. In part, that was accounted for by some spare capacity in the labour market, as the unemployment rate was expected to rise somewhat as demand growth slowed. 59) Bank staffs estimate of underlying pay growth had remained above pre-pandemic rates. Pay settlements had continued to increase as the labour market had tightened. Underlying wage growth was, nevertheless, projected to fall back from its current rate in the November Report central 60) Twelve-month CPI inflation had fallen slightly from 3.2% in August to 3.1% in September. Bank staff expected inflation to rise to just under 4% in October, accounted for predominantly by the impact on utility bills of past strength in wholesale gas prices. CPI inflation was then expected to rise to 4 ½% in November and remain around that level through the winter, accounted for by further increases in core goods and food price inflation. Wholesale gas prices had risen sharply since August, although they had fallen back at the very end of October. CPI inflation was now expected to peak at around 5% in April 2022 in the November Report projections, materially higher than had been expected in the August Report. The path for wholesale energy prices was nevertheless very uncertain, and could change substantially over short periods of time. 61) In the November Report projections, the upward pressure on CPI inflation was expected to dissipate over time, as supply disruption eased, global demand rebalanced, and energy prices stopped rising. As a result, CPI inflation was projected to fall back materially from the second half of next year. Conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPCs current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation was projected to be a little above the 2% target in two years time and just below the target at the end of the forecast period. In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 0.1%, CPI inflation was forecast to be 2.8% in two years time. 62) Since the Committees previous meeting, the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure of household inflation expectations had fallen slightly in October, after rising sharply in September. Medium-term UK inflation compensation measures in financial markets had remained above their post-2008 average levels. Higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks to inflation might have played a role in this, alongside other factors. Professional forecasters expected CPI inflation to be close to target in the medium term. 63) Overall, and as set out in Box C in the November Report, the MPC judged that inflation expectations remained well anchored in the United Kingdom at present. The Committee would, nevertheless, continue to monitor very closely the risk that domestic and global demand and cost pressures could affect medium-term inflation expectations, and so wage and price setting. 64) The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 65) The MPCs remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy had been subject to very large shocks. Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, would as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that were 66) The Committees best collective judgement was that the risks to the medium-term inflation projections in the November Report were broadly balanced. But this masked large risks in both directions, including among other things from energy prices and wage growth. Different MPC members placed different weights on these risks and therefore on the overall balance of risks. 67) In an alternative scenario that was conditioned on energy prices following forward curves throughout the forecast period and as set out in the November Report, CPI inflation fell back towards the target more rapidly than in the MPCs central projection, and was materially lower over the second half of the forecast period. This alternative scenario was consistent with a general tendency for many commodity prices to revert towards their prior levels following similar large 68) The risks around the November Report projection for wage growth to ease were judged to be skewed to the upside. Earnings growth could be boosted over the forecast period by the impact of higher current and expected inflation, if employees resisted declines in their real wages. That would be different to the experience of recent decades, including the dynamics of the labour market following the global financial crisis. It was, however, possible that there could be a break from past wage bargaining behaviour, as some aspects of the labour market were currently quite different to that period. There could also be greater than expected upward pressure on wage growth from: a continuation of a lower availability of workers, for example due to a lower path for participation or migration; sustained demand for labour from the health, education and public administration sector; or a persistence of labour market mismatch within industries or across other dimensions. 69) At its recent meetings, the Committee had judged that some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to meet the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term. The latest developments, set alongside the Committees updated projections, reinforced this view. Nevertheless, near-term uncertainties remained, especially around the outlook for the labour market, and the extent to which domestic cost and price pressures persisted into the 70) At this meeting, most members of the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy, which included the previously announced  £150 billion increase in the target stock of purchased assets, remained appropriate. Importantly, and as had been signalled previously, there was value in waiting for additional information on near-term developments in the labour market, including official data relating to the period following the end of the CJRS, before deciding when a tightening in monetary policy might be warranted. In addition, at least part of the downgrade in near-term UK GDP prospects since the August Report was likely to have reflected a moderation in demand, and downside risks to demand could be accentuated by the impact of higher prices on households real incomes. Current elevated global cost pressures were still most likely to prove transitory, leading to a one-off increase in consumer prices rather than persistently higher inflation rates. In assessing the appropriate monetary policy strategy, it was important to consider the costs, as well as the benefits, of taking out insurance against possible upside risks to medium-term inflation from second-round effects on wages and prices. As had been the case for some time, the ability to loosen monetary policy in response to any significant negative demand shock in the future was to some degree constrained by the effective lower bound of Bank Rate, whereas interest rates could be increased by as much as was needed to bring inflation back to target sustainably should any second-round effects materialise. 71) One member of the Committee joined the majority in noting a moderation in domestic and global activity, along with cross-currents in the domestic labour market and wages, energy price dynamics, and business pricing expectations affecting inflation prospects. But this member also observed a continued elevated level of risky asset prices, despite the increase in government bond yields globally. In light of this, while agreeing with the majority on maintaining Bank Rate, this member judged that it would be appropriate to remove some of the monetary stimulus to asset prices by terminating the existing asset purchase programme at this meeting, ahead of any subsequent increase 72) For two members of the Committee, the economic outlook warranted a tightening in the monetary policy stance at this meeting. These members preferred an immediate end to the existing asset purchase programme, as well as an immediate increase in Bank Rate to 0.25%. Domestic and global cost pressures had remained strong. In the United Kingdom, the labour market had tightened further, with no sign that the end of the furlough scheme had eased labour market strains. These members judged that, with the existing policy stance, CPI inflation was likely to remain above the 2% target in the medium term. This reflected a greater impact from cost pressures, especially pay growth, and the prospect of a larger and more persistent level of excess demand in the United Kingdom than in the central projection in the November Report. Maintaining the current policy stance when CPI inflation was well above target and the output gap was closed might cause medium-term inflation expectations to drift up further. A decision to tighten policy at this meeting would reduce that risk, which might otherwise ultimately necessitate a more abrupt subsequent tightening in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment. It would demonstrate the Committees commitment to returning inflation to target in the medium term and help to ensure that medium-term inflation 73) The Committee judged that, provided the incoming data, particularly on the labour market, were broadly in line with the central projections in the November Monetary Policy Report, it would be necessary over coming months to increase Bank Rate in order to return CPI inflation sustainably to the 2% target. In observing the market-implied path for Bank Rate, the Committee noted that, in the November Monetary Policy Report central projections, CPI inflation was projected to be below the 2% target at the end of the forecast period, and would probably fall a little further beyond that point, given the margin of spare capacity that was 74) Looking beyond the coming months, the Committee would, as always, continue to focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The Committee judged that there were two-sided risks around developments in the economy in the medium term, and would reach its assessment on the balance of these risks in light of the relevant data as they emerged. 75) The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 0.1%; The Bank of England should maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion; The Bank of England should continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the first proposition. Two members (Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 15 basis The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second proposition. Six members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Huw Pill and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the third proposition. Three members (Catherine L Mann, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce the target for the stock of UK government bond purchases from  £875 billion to  £855 billion. 76) The existing programme of  £150 billion of UK government bond purchases had started in January and its completion was expected by around the end of 2021. Further details of the planned operational approach to gilt purchases between the August and December MPC meetings had been set out in the Market Notice accompanying the August 2021 minutes. 77) The Committee would keep the asset purchase programme under review. If needed, there was scope for the Bank of England to re-evaluate the existing technical parameters of the gilt purchase 78) At its September meeting, the MPC had agreed to reinvest the cash flows associated with reductions in the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases held by the Asset Purchase Facility back into eligible corporate bonds, commencing in November 2021. The Committee had subsequently been briefed by Bank staff on the approach that would be taken to making these investments in a way that took account of the climate impact of the issuers of bonds. Details of this approach would be published in the coming days, ahead of reinvestment operations commencing 79) The following members of the Committee were present: Andrew Bailey, ChairBen BroadbentJon CunliffeJonathan HaskelCatherine L MannHuw Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Diana Noble was also present on 27 October and Brad Fried was present on 2 November, as observers for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in their roles as members of the Banks Court of Directors. \n","20150910\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy in order to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 9 September 2015, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose slightly to 0.1% in July but remains well below the 2% target rate.  Around three quarters of the gap between inflation and the target reflects unusually low contributions from energy, food, and other imported goods prices.  The remaining quarter reflects the past weakness of domestic cost growth, and unit labour costs in particular.  Although pay growth has recovered somewhat since the turn of the year, the recent increase in productivity means that the annual rate of growth in unit wage costs is currently around 1%  lower than would be consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term, were it to persist.  Additionally, sterlings appreciation since mid-2013 is having a continuing impact on the prices of imported goods.  A combination of these factors has meant that the average of a range of measures of core inflation remains subdued, although it picked up slightly in July to a little over 1%. Inflation is below the target and the Committees best collective judgement is that there remain at least some underutilised resources in the economy.  In that light, the Committee intends to set monetary policy in order to ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb the remaining economic slack so as to return inflation to the target within two years. The Committee set out its most recent detailed assessment of the economic outlook in the August Inflation Report.  The aim of returning inflation to the target within two years was thought likely to be achieved conditional upon Bank Rate following the gently rising path implied by the market yields prevailing at the time.  Private domestic demand growth was forecast to be robust enough to eliminate the margin of spare capacity over the next year or so, despite the continuing fiscal consolidation and modest global growth.  And that, in turn, was expected to result in the increase in domestic costs needed to return inflation to the target in the medium term, as the temporary negative impact on inflation of lower energy, food and import prices waned.  In the third year of the projection, inflation was forecast to move slightly above the target as sustained growth led to a margin of excess demand. The Committee noted in the August Report that the risks to the growth outlook were skewed moderately to the downside, in part reflecting risks to activity in the euro area and China.  Developments since then have increased the risks to prospects in China, as well as to other emerging economies.  This led to markedly higher volatility in commodity prices and global financial markets. While these developments have the potential to add to the global headwinds to UK growth and inflation, they must be weighed against the prospects for a continued healthy domestic expansion.  Domestic momentum is being underpinned by robust real income growth, supportive credit conditions, and elevated business and consumer confidence.  The rate of unemployment has fallen by over 2 percentage points since the middle of 2013, although that decline has levelled off more recently.  Global developments do not as yet appear sufficient to alter materially the central outlook described in the August Report, but the greater downside risks to the global environment merit close monitoring for any impact on domestic economic activity. There remains a range of views among MPC members about the balance of risks to inflation relative to the target.  At the Committees meeting ending on 9 September the majority of members judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.  Ian McCafferty preferred to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points, given his view that building domestic cost pressures would otherwise be likely to lead to inflation overshooting the target in the medium term. All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path that Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on the economic circumstances. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20160512\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 11 May 2016 the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 0.5% in March but remains well below the 2% inflation target.  This shortfall is due predominantly to unusually large drags from energy and food prices, which are expected to fade over the next year.  Core inflation also remains subdued, largely as a result of weak global price pressures, the past appreciation of sterling and restrained domestic cost growth. Globally, sentiment in financial markets has improved.  There has been a broad-based recovery in risky asset prices, a resumption of capital flows to emerging market economies, and a sharp rise in the price of oil. Near-term prospects for China and other emerging market economies have improved a little, although medium-term downside risks remain.  In the advanced economies, growth has picked up in the euro area in Q1 but slowed in the United States.  A modest pace of growth in the United Kingdoms main trading partners is likely over the forecast period, broadly similar to that in the February Inflation Report projections. In the United Kingdom, activity growth slowed in Q1 and a further deceleration is expected in Q2.  There are increasing signs that uncertainty associated with the EU referendum has begun to weigh on activity.  This is making the relationship between macroeconomic and financial indicators and underlying economic momentum harder to interpret at present.  In the Committees latest projections, activity growth recovers later in the year, but to rates that are a little below their historical average.  Growth over the forecast horizon is expected to be slightly weaker than in the February projection.  The May projection is conditioned on a path for Bank Rate implied by market rates and on continued UK membership of the European Union, including an assumption for the exchange rate consistent with that. As the dampening influence of past falls in energy and food prices unwinds over the next year, inflation should rise mechanically.  Under the same forecast conditioning assumptions described above, spare capacity is projected to be eliminated by early next year, increasing domestic cost pressures and supporting a return of inflation to the 2% target by mid-2018.  Thereafter, as in the February Inflation Report, inflation is forecast to rise slightly above the target, conditioned on the path for Bank Rate implied by market rates. Given the outlook described in the May Inflation Report projections, returning inflation to the 2% target requires achieving a balance between the drag on inflation from external factors and the support from gradual increases in domestic cost growth.  Fully offsetting the drag from external factors over the short run would, in the MPCs judgement, involve too rapid an acceleration in domestic costs, one that would risk being excessive and lead to undesirable volatility in output and employment.  Given these considerations, the MPC intends to set monetary policy to ensure that growth is sufficient to return inflation to the target in around two years and keep it there in the absence of further shocks. Consistent with the projections and conditioning assumptions set out in the May Inflation Report, the MPC judges that it is more likely than not that Bank Rate will need to be higher by the end of the forecast period than at present to ensure inflation returns to the target in a sustainable manner.  All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on economic circumstances.  With macroeconomic and financial indicators likely to be less informative than usual in light of the referendum, the Committee is currently reacting more cautiously to data releases than would normally be the case. The most significant risks to the MPCs forecast concern the referendum.  A vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for output and inflation, and therefore the appropriate setting of monetary policy.  Households could defer consumption and firms delay investment, lowering labour demand and causing unemployment to rise.  At the same time, supply growth is likely to be lower over the forecast period, reflecting slower capital accumulation and the need to reallocate resources.  Sterling is also likely to depreciate further, perhaps sharply.  This combination of influences on demand, supply and the exchange rate could lead to a materially lower path for growth and a notably higher path for inflation than in the central projections set out in the May Inflation Report.  In such circumstances, the MPC would face a trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand and output and employment on the other.  The implications for the direction of monetary policy will depend on the relative magnitudes of the demand, supply and exchange rate effects.  Whatever the outcome of the referendum and its consequences, the MPC will take whatever action is needed to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and inflation returns to the target over the appropriate horizon. Against that backdrop, at its meeting on 11 May, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and to maintain the stock of purchased assets, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £375 billion. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20160114\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy in order to meet the 2% inflation target and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 13 January 2016, the MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion, and so to re-invest the  £8.4 billion of cash flows associated with the redemption of the January 2016 gilt held in the Asset Purchase Facility. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 0.1% in November and is likely to rise modestly further in the coming months as some of the large falls in energy and food prices a year earlier drop out of the annual comparison.  But the 40% decline in dollar oil prices means that the increase in inflation is now expected to be slightly more gradual in the near term than forecast in the Committees November Inflation Report projections.  Although a large part of the current deviation of CPI inflation from the 2% target reflects unusually large drags from energy and food prices, core inflation also remains relatively subdued  a consequence of the past appreciation of sterling, weak global inflation and restrained domestic cost growth. The outlook for inflation in the medium term reflects the balance between the persistence of the dampening influence of factors such as the past appreciation of sterling and subdued world export prices, and prospective further increases in domestic cost growth.  The MPCs objective is to return inflation to the target sustainably, without an overshoot once those persistent disinflationary forces have waned.  Given that, the MPC intends to set monetary policy to ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb remaining spare capacity in a manner that returns inflation to the target in around two years and keeps it there in the absence of further shocks. The MPC set out its most recent detailed assessment of the economic outlook in the November 2015 Inflation Report.  At that time, the Committees central view was that, if Bank Rate were to follow the gently rising path implied by the prevailing market yields, CPI inflation would slightly exceed the 2% target in two years time and then rise further above it, reflecting modest excess demand.  The MPC judged that the risks to this projection lay a little to the downside in the first two years, reflecting global factors. Since then, the data regarding international activity have evolved broadly as expected.  Recent volatility in financial markets has underlined the downside risks to global growth, primarily emanating from emerging markets.  Although the most recent declines in oil prices will depress global inflation in the near term, given they appear primarily to reflect developments on the supply side of the market, these conditions should in time provide net support to spending in the United Kingdom and its major trading partners. Domestically, the most recent data suggest that, after faster growth over the previous two years, output growth was steady during 2015 at rates a little below pre-crisis norms.  Although indicators of private domestic spending appear healthy, business surveys imply that the near-term outlook for aggregate activity is slightly weaker than in the MPCs November central projection.  Productivity growth appears to have recovered somewhat over 2015, but the underlying supply capacity of the economy, and therefore the degree of inflationary pressure resulting from a given pace of demand growth, remain difficult to judge.  Despite continued reductions in the rate of unemployment, pay growth remains restrained and appears to have dipped slightly in the most recent data.  Overall, while domestic cost growth over the past year has been below that necessary for inflation to return sustainably to the 2% target, its pace can be expected to increase over time. As in previous months, there is a range of views among MPC members about the balance of risks to inflation relative to the target in the medium term.  At the Committees meeting ending on 13 January, eight members judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged at present.  Ian McCafferty preferred to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points, given his view that the path of domestic costs was more likely to lead to inflation exceeding the target in the medium term than was embodied in the Committees collective November projections. All members agreed that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so only gradually and to a level lower than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path that Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on the economic circumstances. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20181220\n","The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. Since the MPCs previous meeting, the near-term outlook for global growth has softened and downside risks to growth have increased. Global financial conditions have tightened noticeably, particularly in corporate credit markets. Oil prices have fallen significantly, however, which should provide some support to demand in advanced economies. The decline in oil prices also means that UK CPI inflation is likely to fall below 2% in coming months. The Committee judges that the loosening of fiscal policy in Budget 2018, announced after the November Inflation Report projections were finalised, will boost UK GDP by the end of the MPCs forecast period by around 0.3%, all else equal.    Brexit uncertainties have intensified considerably since the Committees last meeting. These uncertainties are weighing on UK financial markets. UK bank funding costs and non-financial high-yield corporate bond spreads have risen sharply and by more than in other advanced economies. UK-focused equity prices have fallen materially. Sterling has depreciated further, and its volatility has risen substantially. Market-based indicators of inflation expectations in the United Kingdom have risen, including at longer horizons.    The further intensification of Brexit uncertainties, coupled with the slowing global economy, has also weighed on the near-term outlook for UK growth. Business investment has fallen for each of the past three quarters and is likely to remain weak in the near term. The housing market has remained subdued. Indicators of household consumption have generally been more resilient, although retail spending may be slowing.    The MPC has previously noted that shifting expectations about Brexit among financial markets, businesses and households could lead to greater-than-usual short-term volatility in UK data. Judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy requires separating these shorter-term developments from other more persistent factors affecting inflation and from the dynamics of the economy once greater clarity emerges about the nature of EU withdrawal. Domestic inflationary pressures have continued to build. The labour market remains tight, with employment growth picking up in the latest data and the unemployment rate likely to stay around 4% in the near term.   Annual growth in regular pay has risen to 3 ¼%, stronger than anticipated in the November Report. In contrast, services CPI inflation has been subdued. The inflation expectations of households and professional forecasters have remained broadly unchanged.    The Committee judged in November that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with its Inflation Report projections, which were conditioned on a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the UKs eventual trading relationship with the European Union, a margin of excess demand was expected to emerge. In that context, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon.  The broader economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal, in particular: the form of new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond. The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction. The MPC judges at this months meeting that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. The Committee will always act to achieve the 2% inflation target.

The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at  £375 billion. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 0.3% in January.  Inflation nonetheless remains well below the 2% inflation target.  This is due predominantly to unusually large drags from energy and food prices, which are expected to fade in the coming months.  But core inflation also remains subdued, a consequence of the past appreciation of sterling, weak global inflation and restrained domestic cost growth. Returning inflation to the 2% target requires balancing the drag from external factors against increases in domestic cost growth.

Given these considerations, the MPC intends to set monetary policy to ensure that growth is sufficient to return inflation to the target in around two years and keep it there in the absence of further shocks. The MPC set out its most recent detailed assessment of the economic outlook in the February Inflation Report.  Over the medium term, growth in the advanced economies should continue to be supported by the boost to real incomes from low commodity prices, and to some degree by fiscal and monetary policy.  But emerging market economies are likely to grow more slowly than in recent years and the risks to the MPCs central projection of only modest global growth lie to the downside.  Data releases since the February Inflation Report show little change in the near-term outlook for growth in the United Kingdoms main trading partners. In the United Kingdom, underlying growth of private domestic demand remains solid.  A tighter labour market and rising productivity are expected to support real incomes and consumption.  Consumer confidence and most surveys of business investment are above historical averages.  And, in the past month, changes in asset prices have generally been supportive for UK growth and inflation.  The prices of risky assets have rebounded.  Relative to the conditioning assumptions that underlay the projections published in the Committees February Inflation Report, oil prices have risen and UK short-term interest rates and sterling have fallen.  Sterling has depreciated by around 9% in effective terms from its peak in mid-November 2015. Set against that, there appears to be increased uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming referendum on UK membership of the European Union.  That uncertainty is likely to have been a significant driver of the decline in sterling.  It may also delay some spending decisions and depress growth of aggregate demand in the near term.  Overall, however, the Committee judges the outlook for domestic activity to be little changed from the time of the February Inflation Report, with GDP expected to grow at around average rates over the forecast period. Wage growth has evolved broadly as expected in the February Inflation Report.  The return to higher rates of inflation should in time support wage gains.  The MPC judges that inflation expectations remain well anchored, though it remains watchful for signs that low inflation is having more persistent second-round effects on wages.  Overall, while domestic cost growth over the past year has been below that necessary for inflation to return to the 2% target, its pace is expected to increase over time. As in February, there is a range of views among MPC members about the balance of risks to inflation relative to the central projection presented in the February Inflation Report.  At its meeting ending on 16 March, the MPC judged it appropriate to leave the stance of monetary policy unchanged.  The MPCs best collective judgement is that it is more likely than not that Bank Rate will need to increase over the forecast period to ensure inflation returns to the target in a sustainable fashion. All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles.  This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.  The actual path Bank Rate will follow over the next few years will depend on the economic circumstances. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20191219\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 18 December 2019, the MPC voted by a majority of 7-2 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The Committees latest projections for activity and inflation were set out in the November Monetary Policy Report and were based on the assumption of an orderly transition to a deep free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. UK GDP growth was projected to pick up from current below-potential rates, supported by the reduction of Brexit-related uncertainties, an easing of fiscal policy and a modest recovery in global growth. With demand growth outstripping the subdued pace of supply growth, excess demand and domestic inflationary pressures were expected to build gradually. CPI inflation was projected to rise to slightly above the 2% target towards the end of the forecast period. Since the MPCs previous meeting, economic data have been broadly in line with the November Report. Global growth has shown tentative signs of stabilising and global financial conditions remain supportive. The partial de-escalation of the US-China trade war provides some additional support to the outlook relative to the November Report, although trade tensions remain elevated. UK GDP increased by 0.3% in 2019 Q3 and is expected to rise only marginally in Q4. Household consumption has continued to grow steadily, but business investment and export orders have remained weak. Financial markets have remained sensitive to domestic policy developments. Since the November Report, the sterling exchange rate has appreciated by 2% and UK-focused equities have outperformed their international counterparts. There is no evidence yet about the extent to which policy uncertainties among companies and households have declined. There continue to be some signs that the labour market is loosening, although it remains tight. Employment growth has slowed and vacancies have fallen, but the unemployment rate has remained stable and the employment rate is around its record high. Although pay growth has eased somewhat, unit labour costs have continued to grow at rates above those consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term. CPI inflation remained at 1.5% in November and core CPI inflation remained at 1.7%, broadly as expected. The headline rate is still expected to fall to around 1 ¼% by the spring, owing to the temporary effects of falls in regulated energy and water prices. Monetary policy could respond in either direction to changes in the economic outlook in order to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. The Committee will, among other factors, continue to monitor closely the responses of companies and households to Brexit developments as well as the prospects for a recovery in global growth. If global growth fails to stabilise or if Brexit uncertainties remain entrenched, monetary policy may need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation. Further ahead, provided these risks do not materialise and the economy recovers broadly in line with the MPCs latest projections, some modest tightening of policy, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, may be needed to maintain inflation sustainably at the target. The MPC judges at this meeting that the existing stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Monetary policy summary and minutes Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20170316\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 15 March 2017, the Committee voted by a majority of 8-1 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%.  The Committee voted unanimously to continue with the programme of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, totalling up to  £10 billion.  The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. As the MPC had observed at the time of the UKs referendum on EU membership, the appropriate path for monetary policy depends on the evolution of demand, potential supply, the exchange rate, and therefore inflation.  The Committee expects a slowdown in aggregate demand over the course of this year, as household demand growth declines in reaction to lower real income growth.  Official estimates of retail sales have weakened notably, consistent with this expectation, although other indicators of consumer demand such as consumer confidence have been steadier.  Measures of overall activity growth have been resilient, with official estimates indicating a fairly steady pace of expansion around historical average rates and business surveys suggesting little change in the near term.  It is possible that slowing consumption may be offset to some degree by other components of demand, such as a more supportive net trade position following last years fall in sterling and the recent pickup in global momentum. Consistent with prospects for stronger global growth, equity prices have generally risen internationally, and short and long-term interest rates have increased in some economies.  The evolution of asset prices has been different in the United Kingdom, however, where market interest rates have fallen and the equity prices of companies with significant domestic exposure  most notably to consumers  have underperformed.  Those developments seem somewhat difficult to reconcile with the ongoing resilience of most macroeconomic indicators.  In addition, for some time, financial markets and households appear to have had different perspectives on UK economic prospects.  This difference cannot persist indefinitely, and the nature and timing of its resolution are likely to be key factors in the MPCs policy assessment. CPI inflation increased to 1.8% in January, and the MPC expects it to rise above the 2% target over the next few months, before peaking at around 2 ¾% in early 2018 and drifting gradually back down towards the target thereafter.  The projected overshoot entirely reflects the expected effects of the drop in sterling.  Pay growth has remained subdued, while measures of inflation expectations remain at levels broadly consistent with the achievement of the inflation target. Monetary policy cannot prevent either the real adjustment that is necessary as the UK moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany it over the next few years.  Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth.  For this reason, the MPCs remit specifies that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance the trade-off between the speed with which it intends to return inflation to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity.  At its March meeting, the MPC continued to judge that it remained appropriate to seek to return inflation to the target over a somewhat longer period than usual.  Eight members thought that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to balance the demands of the Committees remit.  Kristin Forbes considered it appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points. As the Committee has previously noted, there are limits to the extent that above-target inflation can be tolerated.  The continuing suitability of the current policy stance depends on the trade-off between above-target inflation and slack in the economy.  The projections described in the February Inflation Report depend in good part on three main judgements:  that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices broadly as expected, and without adverse consequences for expectations of inflation further ahead;  that regular pay growth does indeed remain modest, consistent with the Committees updated assessment of the remaining degree of slack in the labour market;  and that the hitherto resilient rates of household spending growth slow as real income gains weaken, without a sufficient offset by other components of demand. In judging the appropriate policy stance, the Committee will be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding these and other factors.  At present, the Committees best collective view is that the central judgements underpinning the February projections remain broadly on track, and so the conditioning assumption underpinning the February projections  that there will be some modest withdrawal of monetary stimulus over the course of the forecast period  remains appropriate.  There are risks in both directions.  For example, if aggregate demand growth remains resilient, monetary policy may need to be tightened sooner and to a greater degree than that implied path.  A more marked slowdown in activity than currently anticipated by the Committee, by contrast, could warrant additional policy support relative to that implied path.  Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. NOTE: The version of the MPC minutes that was originally published mistakenly referred to the January outturn for CPI inflation as having been for February.  This has now been corrected.  The outturn for February will be published by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday 21 March. The MPC did not have pre-release access to these data. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20201105\n","\n","20180510\n","The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The MPCs updated projections for inflation and activity are set out in the May Inflation Report. The outlook and the main factors shaping it are broadly similar to those set out in the previous Report. The preliminary estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter was 0.1%, 0.3 percentage points lower than expected in February. This is likely in part to have reflected adverse weather in late February and early March. Survey indicators suggest that growth was somewhat stronger in Q1 than implied by the preliminary estimate. Despite the near-term softness, the MPCs central forecast for economic activity is little changed from that in the previous Report. In the MPCs central forecast, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, GDP is expected to grow by around 1 ¾% per year on average over the forecast period. On the expenditure side, growth continues to rotate towards net trade and business investment and away from consumption. Although business investment is still restrained by Brexit-related uncertainties, it is being supported, like exports, by strong global demand and accommodative financial conditions. Household consumption growth remains subdued, in line with the modest growth in real income over the forecast period. Wage growth and domestic cost pressures are firming gradually, broadly as expected. The MPC continues to judge that the UK economy has a very limited degree of slack. Hiring intentions have remained strong and, over the past three months, the unemployment rate has fallen slightly further. While modest by historical standards, the projected pace of GDP growth over the forecast is nonetheless slightly faster than the diminished rate of supply growth, which averages around 1 ½% per year. In the MPCs central projection, therefore, a small margin of excess demand still emerges by early 2020, feeding through into higher rates of pay growth and domestic cost pressures. CPI inflation fell to 2.5% in March, lower than expected at the time of the February Report. The inflation rates of the most import-intensive components of the CPI appear to have peaked. The MPC judges that the impact of the past depreciation of sterling on CPI inflation, while remaining significant, is likely to fade a little faster than previously thought. Taking external and domestic influences together, CPI inflation is projected to fall back slightly more quickly than in February, reaching the target in two years.  These projections are conditioned on a gently rising path for Bank Rate over the next three years. In the exceptional circumstances presented by Brexit, as specified in its remit, the MPC has been balancing any significant trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. The prospect of excess demand over the forecast period has reduced the degree to which it is appropriate for the MPC to accommodate an extended period of inflation above the target. The Committees best collective judgement therefore remains that, were the economy to develop broadly in line with the May Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a conventional horizon. As previously, however, that judgement relies on the economic data evolving broadly in line with the Committees projections. For the majority of members, an increase in Bank Rate was not required at this meeting. All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. Monetary policy summary and minutes Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20200313\n","The Governor invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: The Committee voted unanimously in favour of all four propositions. \n","20161215\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 14 December 2016 the Committee voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously to continue with the programme of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases totalling up to  £10 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. The Committee also voted unanimously to continue with the programme of  £60 billion of UK government bond purchases to take the total stock of these purchases to  £435 billion, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. In the November Inflation Report, the Committee set out its projections for output, unemployment and inflation, conditioned on average market yields.  Output was expected to grow at a moderate pace in the near term, but slow from the beginning of next year.  In part that reflected the likelihood that household real income growth would slow and hence weaken household spending.  It also reflected uncertainty over future trading arrangements, and the risk that UK-based firms access to EU markets could be materially reduced, which could restrain business activity and supply growth over a protracted period.  The unemployment rate was projected to rise to around 5 ½% by the middle of 2018 and to stay at around that level throughout 2019.  Largely as a result of the depreciation of sterling, CPI inflation was expected to rise to around 2 ¾% in 2018, before falling back gradually over 2019 to reach 2 ½% in three years time.  Inflation was judged likely to return to close to the target over the following year. Since November, long-term interest rates have risen internationally, including in the United Kingdom.  In part, this reflects expectations of looser fiscal policy in the United States which, if it materialises, will help to underpin the slightly greater momentum in the global economy evident in a range of data since the summer.  At the same time, however, the global outlook has become more fragile, with risks in China, the euro area and some emerging markets, and an increase in policy uncertainty. Domestically, data released since the Committees previous meeting continue to indicate that activity is growing at a moderate pace, supported by solid consumption growth.  Forward-looking components of business surveys are weaker than those regarding current output, however, suggesting that some slowing in activity is in prospect during 2017.  The timing and extent of this slowing will depend crucially on the evolution of wages and how resilient household spending is to the pressure on real incomes from higher inflation. Twelve-month CPI inflation stood at 1.2% in November, up from 0.9% in October and 1.0% in September.  Looking forward, the MPC expects inflation to rise to the 2% target within six months.  Since the Committees previous meeting, sterlings trade-weighted exchange rate has appreciated by over 6%, while dollar oil prices have risen by 14%.  All else equal, this would result in a slightly lower path for inflation than envisaged in the November Inflation Report, though it is still likely to overshoot the target later in 2017 and through 2018. The MPCs Remit requires that monetary policy should balance the speed with which inflation is returned to the target with the support for real activity.  The lower level of sterling since the vote to leave the European Union has adversely affected that trade-off.  Sterlings effect on CPI inflation will ultimately prove temporary and fully offsetting it would require exerting further downward pressure on domestic costs, including wages, and would therefore involve lost output and higher unemployment.  The Committee continues to judge that such outcomes would be undesirable and, consistent with its Remit, that it would therefore be appropriate to set policy so that inflation returns to its target over a longer period than the usual 18-24 months. Equally, there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.  Those limits depend, for example, on the cause of the inflation overshoot, the extent of second-round effects on domestic costs, the evolution of inflation expectations, and the scale of the shortfall in economic activity below potential.  Inflation expectations at medium-term horizons had been somewhat below their past average levels, reflecting the period of below-target inflation, although some measures have risen more recently.  The Committee continues to monitor the evolution of these expectations closely. In light of these developments, and in keeping with its Remit, the MPC at its December meeting agreed unanimously that Bank Rate should be maintained at its current level.  It also agreed unanimously to continue the previously announced asset purchase programmes, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. Earlier in the year, the Committee noted that the path of monetary policy following the referendum on EU membership would depend on the evolution of the prospects for demand, supply, the exchange rate, and therefore inflation.  This remains the case.  Monetary policy can respond, in either direction, to changes to the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20210805\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 4 August 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion. The Committee voted by a majority of 7-1 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at  £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at  £895 billion. The Committees updated projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report. They assume that, despite the spread of the Delta variant, the impact of Covid on the UK economy fades further over time. They are also conditioned on the market path for interest rates. Global GDP growth is estimated to have risen sharply in 2021 Q2, as Covid vaccination programmes gathered pace and restrictions were eased further. Partly reflecting the spread of the Delta variant, global growth in Q3 is expected to expand at a slower pace than anticipated in the May Report. Global price pressures have continued to build, reflecting the speed and unevenness of the recovery in activity, and disruptions to supply chains. UK GDP is expected to have risen by 5% in 2021 Q2, leaving it around 4% below its pre-pandemic level and slightly stronger than expected in the May Report. After the MPCs previous meeting, the number of Covid cases continued to rise but has subsequently shown signs of falling back, although there has been a sharp increase in the number of people being asked to self-isolate temporarily. The majority of remaining domestic Covid restrictions have now been lifted. Faster indicators of household spending have been broadly flat, at close to pre-Covid levels, but the housing market has remained strong. GDP is expected to grow by around 3% in Q3, somewhat weaker than expected in the May Report, with a small negative impact from recent developments in the pandemic. UK GDP is projected to recover further over the remainder of the year, reaching its pre-pandemic level in 2021 Q4, with demand growth boosted by a waning impact from Covid. Further out, the pace of GDP growth is expected to slow towards more normal rates, partly reflecting the gradual tightening in the stance of announced fiscal policy. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate was 4.8% in the three months to May, 1 percentage point higher than at the end of 2019. The inactivity rate was also 1 percentage point above its level at the end of 2019. The number of full and part-time furloughed jobs has continued to decline as demand has recovered, but remained at around 2 million at the end of June. The stock of vacancies has increased further, as have indicators of recruitment difficulties. There appear to have been difficulties in matching available jobs and workers. These frictions are for a period reducing effective supply in the economy. Overall, the MPC judges that spare capacity has been eroded over the past couple of quarters, as demand has outstripped growth in effective supply. Frictions in the labour market are judged likely to dissipate over the forecast period, boosting growth in effective supply capacity. There is uncertainty around these judgements, including how the economy will adjust to the end of the furlough scheme. Private sector regular pay in the three months to May was over 7% higher than a year earlier, and annual growth is projected to have peaked at around 8 ½% in 2021 Q2. Adjusted for the impact of the furlough scheme, the changing composition of employment during the pandemic and annual base effects, underlying pay growth appears to continue to be around pre-Covid rates. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 2.5% in June, above the MPCs 2% target and 0.8 percentage points higher than expected in the May Report. Core CPI inflation has also risen further, to 2.3%, as building global input cost pressures have been passed through to some consumer goods prices and, to a lesser degree, the reopening of the economy has led to a pickup in some consumer services and goods prices. CPI inflation is projected to rise temporarily in the near term, to 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and other goods prices, before falling back to close to the 2% target. The Committees central expectation is that current elevated global and domestic cost pressures will prove transitory. Nonetheless, the economy is projected to experience a more pronounced period of above-target inflation in the near term than expected in the May Report. And, alongside temporary constraints on supply, the rapid recovery in demand has eroded spare capacity such that the economy is projected to have a margin of excess demand for a period. In the medium term, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, inflation is projected to fall back to close to the 2% target, and demand and supply are expected to return broadly to balance. The MPC has had policy guidance in place specifying that it does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. Some members of the Committee judge that, although considerable progress has been made in achieving the conditions of that guidance, the conditions are not yet met fully. The other members judge that the conditions of the guidance have been met fully, but note that the guidance made clear that these have only ever been necessary not sufficient conditions for any future tightening in monetary policy. All members confirm that in judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will, as always, focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. In particular, the Committee will not put undue weight on capacity pressures that are frictional in nature and likely to be temporary. The Committee will be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding developments in the labour market, and particularly unemployment, wider measures of slack and underlying wage pressures. In addition, there remain two-sided risks around the central path for inflation in the medium term. Risk management considerations continue to have some force. The Committee judges that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report, some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period is likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. 1) Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. 2) UK-weighted global GDP growth was estimated to have risen sharply in 2021 Q2, as Covid vaccination programmes had gathered pace and restrictions had eased further. Growth in Q2 was likely to have been somewhat stronger than projected in the May Monetary Policy Report. Partly reflecting the spread of the Delta variant, global GDP in Q3 was expected to expand at a slower pace than had been anticipated in the May Report. 3) Global price pressures had continued to build, reflecting the speed and unevenness of the recovery in global activity, supply chain disruptions, and some shortages of inputs. Some of these factors were likely to be transitory and could subsequently unwind. There had been further sharp increases in manufacturing output prices and non-oil commodity prices had also risen a little recently. The Brent oil spot price had fallen slightly since the MPCs previous meeting, however, to around $72 per barrel, with the increased production announced by OPEC+ members on 18 July having pushed down somewhat on prices. Shipping costs had increased further, although disruption at major Chinese ports had been easing and global containerised trade flows had continued to rise. 4) These factors had combined with strong demand for certain goods and services to push consumer price inflation higher in many advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs) in recent months. In the United States, core PCE inflation had ticked up to 3.5% in June, while the headline measure had remained unchanged at 4.0%. In the euro area, headline HICP inflation had increased somewhat in July, to 2.2%, although the core measure had fallen a little to 0.7%. Headline inflation in these regions was expected to fall somewhat in coming quarters, as some of the previous rises had reflected factors that were likely to be temporary, such as the contribution of energy prices and sector-specific supply and demand mismatches. In China, by contrast, consumer price inflation had remained subdued, although producer price inflation had picked up sharply. 5) According to the preliminary flash estimate, euro-area GDP had grown by 2.0% in 2021 Q2, following a slight fall in Q1. This Q2 outturn was stronger than expected at the time of the MPCs previous meeting, although it still left the level of GDP around 3% lower than immediately before the pandemic, in 2019 Q4. Led by the service sector, the euro-area composite output PMI had risen further in July, to 60.2, and the European Commissions business confidence survey balances had also picked up again. The euro-area unemployment rate had fallen by 0.3 percentage points to 7.7% in June. Recent news on the spread of the Delta variant was likely to push down on GDP growth in Q3 compared with previous assumptions. 6) According to the advance estimate, US GDP had increased by 1.6% in 2021 Q2. This was slightly weaker than expected at the time of the MPCs previous meeting, but it had been sufficient to raise the level of GDP back above its pre-Covid peak. Within this, household spending had continued to grow robustly, with services consumption having accelerated but goods consumption growth having slowed. In the labour market, the unemployment rate was little changed at 5.9% in June, but inactivity had remained persistently high, and there were signs of elevated mismatch, with a high level of vacancies despite unemployment remaining well above its pre-Covid rate. Recent news on the spread of the Delta variant was likely to weigh on GDP growth in Q3, although mobility indices and internet searches related to social spending suggested that the impact on US economic activity was likely to be smaller than in other major advanced economies. 7) In China, GDP growth had picked up to 1.3% in 2021 Q2, in line with expectations at the time of the MPCs previous meeting, following a relatively weak expansion of 0.4% in Q1. Covid-related restrictions imposed in Guangdong province in May and June appeared to have had a fairly limited impact on aggregate economic activity. Monthly data for June had suggested some rebalancing towards private domestic demand, with retail sales and manufacturing investment strengthening, albeit with property investment moderating. 8) In a number of large EMEs, there had been a sharp increase in Covid cases recently. The latest business surveys had nevertheless pointed to a mixed picture across countries, with manufacturing PMIs for July recovering in India and Turkey, but falling sharply in South Africa and Indonesia. The rollout of vaccines in EMEs continued to have been generally more limited than in many advanced economies. Given this, aggregate growth in large EMEs appeared likely to slow somewhat in the third quarter, and the economic impact from the spread of the Delta variant was expected to be more persistent than in advanced economies. 9) The Committee discussed any lessons that could be learned from the economic experience of countries that had taken earlier steps to relax Covid restrictions than the United Kingdom, such as Australia, New Zealand and Israel. None of these countries provided an exact parallel to the United Kingdoms situation, and each had had different experiences of the virus and policy responses. There were nevertheless some noteworthy features. Household savings had tended to decline from elevated rates after restrictions were lifted, but had not fallen materially below their pre-Covid levels, suggesting that there had been no rapid run-down of involuntarily accumulated savings. There had been only a gradual normalisation in the composition of consumer demand, with demand for durable goods remaining high as demand for services recovered. Governments in Australia and New Zealand appeared to have been able to withdraw support from the labour market without a sharp increase in unemployment. 10) Advanced-economy longer-term government bond yields had fallen since the MPCs previous meeting, reversing some of the increases seen earlier in the year. The main drivers of these movements appeared to have been increased concerns about Covid-related risks to the global growth outlook. The falls in yields had been accounted for primarily by real rates, with inflation compensation components having been broadly stable. 11) Market-implied measures of advanced-economy policy rates had fallen a little since the MPCs previous meeting. At its meeting on 22 July, the ECB Governing Council had left its key policy interest rates and the scale and pace of its asset purchase programmes unchanged. The Governing Council had earlier published its new monetary policy strategy, on 8 July, which had included the adoption of a symmetric 2% inflation target over the medium term. The conclusions of the strategy review had been largely in line with market expectations. At its 28 July meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee had left unchanged its target range for the federal funds rate and the pace of asset purchases. 12) The market-implied path for Bank Rate that underpinned the August Monetary Policy Report projections rose to around 0.5% at the MPCs three-year forecast horizon, little changed from the May Report. 13) Movements in risky asset prices since the MPCs previous meeting had been mixed. US equity prices had increased, but in the United Kingdom and euro area, they had been little changed. Although the fall in government bond yields had supported equity prices, equity risk premia had risen in all regions, possibly reflecting a perceived increase in the risk posed by Covid to the economic outlook. Equity prices related to companies in industries that had been most exposed to Covid, such as airlines, had continued to underperform headline indices. 14) The sterling effective exchange rate had been broadly stable since the previous MPC meeting. 15) Credit supply conditions for households had loosened since the Committees previous meeting, particularly for mortgage lending, for which much of the tightening that had occurred since the onset of the pandemic had unwound. Spreads on fixed-term mortgages had continued to fall. Net secured lending to households had risen to an all-time high of  £17.9 billion in June. This strength was in large part due to an elevated number of property transactions completing before the tapering in July of the temporary stamp duty threshold in England and Northern Ireland, and the removal of the similar tax change in Wales. The net flow of consumer credit had continued to be slightly positive in June, having edged up gradually over the previous few months. 16) While credit conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises had tightened in 2021 Q2 with the ending of some government lending schemes, conditions for the corporate sector overall had been little changed, and were looser than expected in the May Report. 17) UK GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.8% in May, slightly weaker than had been expected by Bank staff immediately prior to the release. Within this, consumer-facing services output had increased by around 5% on the month, reflecting the reopening of indoor hospitality and non-self-contained accommodation. Private business-to-business services, construction and manufacturing output in May had been weaker than expected, however. In particular, there had been some evidence of global supply chain disruptions weighing on UK activity, with a shortage of semiconductor microchips leading to a sharp fall in car production. For the second quarter as a whole, Bank staff continued to expect GDP to have been slightly stronger than forecast at the time of the May Monetary Policy Report. The August Report projections incorporated 2021 Q2 quarterly growth of 5%, which would have left GDP around 4% below its level in 2019 Q4, prior to the pandemic. 18) After the MPCs previous meeting, the number of Covid cases had continued to increase but had subsequently shown signs of falling back, although there had been a sharp increase in the number of people asked to self-isolate temporarily through various channels. The number of hospitalisations of Covid patients and, in particular, deaths within 28 days of testing positive for Covid had risen to a lesser degree than during previous waves of the pandemic. The vaccination programme had continued. The majority of remaining domestic Covid restrictions had been lifted in England on 19 July, and were planned to be relaxed to a similar degree in Wales on 7 August and in Scotland on 9 August. Restrictions in Northern Ireland had been lifted progressively in late July. 19) Having picked up strongly in April and May, immediately following the reopening of the economy, faster indicators of household spending, such as CHAPS payments data, had been broadly flat in June and July, at levels close to those immediately before the pandemic. Measures of consumer confidence had also stabilised. Official retail sales volumes had risen by 0.5% in June, following a 1.3% fall in May, and leaving the level of sales around 9% above its 2019 Q4 level. Private new car registrations had risen slightly in June, to around their pre-pandemic levels. 20) Residential property transactions had picked up significantly in June, to 198,000 from 114,000 in May, as buyers had completed transactions before the tapering in July of the temporary stamp duty threshold in England and Northern Ireland, and the removal of the similar tax change in Wales. The number of mortgage approvals for house purchase had fallen slightly in June, however, to 81,300. The UK house price index had risen by 0.5% in May, taking the inflation rate in the three months to May compared to the same period a year earlier to around 10%. Timelier indicators had suggested some ongoing strength in house price inflation in the near term, with surveys and intelligence from the Banks Agents continuing to point to demand running ahead of supply. 21) The ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey suggested that the share of UK companies open for trading had increased slightly further since the MPCs previous meeting, although that share appeared to have stabilised at around 90% in the most recent data. There had been tentative signs that rising Covid cases and the number of individuals self-isolating had affected workplace mobility in some areas. Evidence from both manufacturing and services PMI surveys suggested that there remained substantial backlogs of work. The Banks Agents had also reported constraints on output from frictions in both global and domestic supply chains, shortages of heavy goods vehicle delivery drivers and restrictions in labour supply. Official trade data for May had continued to show that goods imports from the European Union had been weaker than imports from non-EU countries. 22) Companies expectations of the near-term impact of Covid on business investment had been at similar levels in the July Decision Maker Panel survey as in the May survey that the Committee had had available at its previous meeting. Firms expected investment in 2021 Q3 to be around 6% lower than it would otherwise have been, and around 3% lower in 2021 Q4. Agency contacts had reported that companies in several sectors were expecting to resume investment projects that had been put on hold during the pandemic, particularly in sectors in which demand was outpacing capacity. 23) Overall, GDP was expected to grow by around 3% in 2021 Q3 in the August Report projection, compared with just over 4% in the May Report. Despite the upside news in activity anticipated for the second quarter, this meant that the level of GDP was projected to be slightly lower in the third quarter than at the time of the May Report, with a small negative impact expected from recent developments in the pandemic. 24) The Committee discussed the risks around the near-term outlook for GDP. The impact of the Delta variant could, against a counterfactual of stronger growth, already be having a larger negative impact on activity than the Committee was assuming, including via voluntary social distancing. If the recent moderation in Covid cases persisted then that could lead to stronger-than-expected growth further out, however. And it was not clear to what extent voluntary social distancing was affecting spending at an aggregate level if consumption could now be substituted away more easily from activities considered riskier from a health perspective. But some levelling off in many indicators of spending had occurred before the latest pickup in cases and so it was also possible that the flattening in consumer spending over recent months had simply reflected an easing of the initial release of pent-up demand. This had also been observed in countries that had reopened earlier than the United Kingdom. 25) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen from 5.2% in 2020 Q4 to 4.8% in the three months to May, although it had remained 1 percentage point higher than at the end of 2019. The LFS inactivity rate was also around 1 percentage point higher than it had been before the pandemic. LFS responses since the beginning of 2020 had been reweighted using population weights informed by HMRC payrolls data. The revised LFS estimates were now consistent with a broadly stable population aged 16 and over, and had shown a slightly steeper decrease in the employment rate relative to earlier estimates for the period. HMRC payroll figures had continued to show a much steeper decline in the number of employees during 2020 than implied by the LFS, but had also shown a sharper recovery since the turn of the year. The HMRC series had increased by around a further 350,000 between May and June, although it was still around 200,000 lower than in February 2020. 26) The number of jobs furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) had fallen by around 600,000 during June, to just under 1.9 million by the end of the month, equivalent to around 8% of private sector jobs. The latest data from the ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey, scaled to match the administrative estimates, had suggested that around 6% of private sector jobs were furloughed in the first half of July, of which 55% of these jobs were held by employees on a flexible form of furlough that allowed them to have undertaken some work with their employer. The proportion of salary for furloughed hours covered by the government had been tapered from 80% to 70% in July and to 60% from 1 August, with employers required to top up to 80%. 27) The increases in unemployment, inactivity and the number of jobs furloughed since the onset of the pandemic suggested a material amount of labour market slack. Other indicators pointed to the labour market having been tighter, however. The stock of vacancies had increased further in June, to almost 20% above its 2019 average, such that the single-month ratio of vacancies to unemployment had returned to its level in early 2020. The latest Banks Agents score for recruitment difficulties had also risen sharply to close to its pre-pandemic level, and the index of staff availability in the REC Report on Jobs had reached a record low in June. The speed and scale of the recovery in labour demand had contributed to increasing recruitment difficulties. In addition, there appeared to have been difficulties in matching available jobs and workers, perhaps reflecting disparities across geographical areas. In recent weeks, some of the Agents contacts had also reported a significant number of employees self-isolating for a period, contributing to temporary labour shortages. 28) Private sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had risen by 7.2% in the three months to May on a year earlier, and the annual rate was projected to have peaked at around 8 ½% in 2021 Q2 in the August Monetary Policy Report forecast. Annual AWE growth rates had been boosted by base effects, reflecting the marked drop in pay in 2020 Q2. The recent strength had also reflected significant compositional effects, with the jobs lost during the pandemic skewed towards lower-paid roles. Adjusted for the effects of the CJRS and changes in composition, Bank staff estimated that private sector regular pay had risen by an annualised rate of 2 ¾% since 2019 Q4, including 4% annualised growth in the first half of this year, the latter of which was around the rates seen prior to the pandemic. There was a lot of uncertainty around these estimates, however. The Agents had also reported a pickup in pay settlements, and signs of pay pressures emerging more broadly, with a number of contacts reviewing pay structures or giving targeted pay increases or bonuses. 29) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 2.1% in May to 2.5% in June, 0.8 percentage points higher than projected in the May Report. Similarly, core CPI inflation, excluding food, beverages, tobacco and energy, had risen from 2.0% to 2.3%. The bulk of the news had been in core goods components, such as cars and clothing and footwear, with some additional upside news in services, and catering prices in particular, and to a lesser degree energy prices. Goods prices had increased globally, reflecting strong demand for goods and supply shortages. Some of the recent strength in CPI inflation might have also been related to the initial reopening of some sectors of the economy. 30) CPI inflation was projected to rise further in the near term, to around 4% in 2021 Q4. Almost half of the projected increase was accounted for by higher energy price inflation. At the same time, core CPI inflation was projected to rise to around 3%. The Agents contacts had reported further increases in the costs of a wide range of materials and commodities, and higher-than-usual freight and warehousing costs, with such costs having been passed through to consumer prices to a greater extent than earlier in the year. Price and cost indicators, such as the manufacturing input and output PMIs, had remained high since the MPCs June meeting, and in some cases had strengthened further, posing a potential upside risk to the short-term inflation forecast alongside increasing labour cost pressures. UK import prices had picked up less strongly than these other cost measures would suggest, however, albeit by more than might have been expected given developments in world export prices and the sterling exchange rate. To the extent that CPI inflation had been boosted initially by the lifting of restrictions, there was the potential for such inflationary pressures to moderate as demand settled down. 31) Companies expectations of inflation one and two years ahead had increased, according to a range of business surveys, including the latest Deloitte CFO and CBI surveys and the July Decision Maker Panel. One-year ahead financial market and professional forecasters inflation expectations had also risen in 2021 Q2, and the Citi/YouGov measure of household one-year ahead inflation expectations had risen in July, having fallen a little in Q2. Short-term household measures tended to be correlated with inflation outturns, so it was possible that they would increase somewhat further alongside the expected rise in CPI inflation over the coming months. Medium-term measures of inflation expectations were expected to be more stable in the face of a temporary shock to inflation. The Citi/YouGov five-year ahead measure of inflation expectations had remained unchanged in July. Medium-term financial market measures of UK inflation compensation, such as the five-year inflation swap rate, five years forward, had been broadly stable since the MPCs previous meeting, at a little above their average levels over the previous decade. 32) The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 33) The Committee reviewed recent developments against the backdrop of its latest economic projections as set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report. Those projections assumed that, despite the spread of the Delta variant, the impact of Covid on the UK economy faded further over time. They were also conditioned on the market path for interest rates. 34) Global GDP growth was estimated to have risen sharply in 2021 Q2, as Covid vaccination programmes had gathered pace and restrictions had been eased further. Partly reflecting the spread of the Delta variant, global GDP in Q3 was expected to expand at a slower pace than had been anticipated in the May Report. In the August Report projections, UK-weighted world GDP continued to rise robustly in the near term, as the impact of Covid continued to wane, supported by vaccination programmes. The pace of the expansion in global GDP slowed over 2022, with growth returning to around pre-Covid rates in the latter years of the forecast period. 35) Global price pressures had continued to build, reflecting the speed and unevenness of the recovery in activity, and disruptions to supply chains. These developments had been reflected in world export price inflation, which had picked up sharply. Such trends could persist for a period, particularly if supply chains were vulnerable to further Covid-related disruptions. The strength in global inflationary pressures was expected to be transitory in the Committees central projections, however. And it was possible that price pressures could prove to be weaker than expected in the medium term, as previous periods of elevated tradable goods prices had often been followed by periods of relatively low inflation, possibly because supply had adjusted only with a lag. 36) Advanced-economy longer-term government bond yields had fallen since the MPCs previous meeting, possibly reflecting concerns about Covid-related risks to global growth. The falls in yields had been accounted for primarily by real rates, with inflation compensation components having been broadly stable. Movements in risky asset prices globally had been mixed. Credit supply conditions for UK households had loosened, particularly for mortgage lending, for which much of the tightening that had occurred since the onset of the pandemic had unwound. 37) As of 4 August 2021, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility had reached  £845 billion, including  £100 billion of the  £150 billion programme of UK government bond purchases announced on 5 November 2020. 38) UK GDP was expected to have risen by 5% in 2021 Q2, leaving it around 4% below its pre-pandemic level and slightly stronger than expected in the May Report. 39) After the MPCs previous meeting, the number of Covid cases in the United Kingdom had continued to rise but had subsequently shown signs of falling back, although there had been a sharp increase in the number of people being asked to self-isolate temporarily. The majority of remaining domestic Covid restrictions had now been lifted. 40) Faster indicators of household spending had been broadly flat, at close to pre-Covid levels, but the housing market had remained strong. There was some evidence of constraints on output from frictions in supply chains, and restrictions in labour supply. GDP was expected to grow by around 3% in 2021 Q3, somewhat weaker than expected in the May Report, with a small negative impact from recent developments in the pandemic. In the near term, the risks to GDP were judged to be skewed to the downside of the central forecast, as there could be an impact on UK and global activity from a renewed rise in Covid cases, especially if any new variants of the virus emerged for which vaccine efficacy was significantly lower. 41) UK GDP was projected to recover further over the remainder of the year, reaching its pre-pandemic level in 2021 Q4, with demand growth boosted by a waning impact from Covid. Further out, the pace of GDP growth was expected to slow towards more normal rates. Over the forecast period, consumption was supported by households running down around 10% of the additional savings they had accumulated in aggregate while spending on some activities had been restricted. Fiscal policy was estimated to continue to support UK demand in the near term, with the policy stance tightening gradually over time in line with government announcements. 42) The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had been 4.8% in the three months to May, 1 percentage point higher than at the end of 2019. The inactivity rate had also been 1 percentage point above its level at the end of 2019. The number of full and part-time furloughed jobs had continued to decline as demand had recovered, but had remained at around 2 million at the end of June. The stock of vacancies had increased further, as had indicators of recruitment difficulties. There appeared to have been difficulties in matching available jobs and workers. These frictions were for a period reducing effective supply in the economy, suggesting that the unemployment rate consistent with stabilising wage growth at rates in line with meeting the inflation target was at present higher than prior to the pandemic. Overall, the MPC judged that spare capacity had been eroded over the past couple of quarters, as demand had outstripped growth in effective supply. Frictions in the labour market were judged likely to dissipate over the forecast period, boosting growth in effective supply capacity. There was uncertainty around these judgements, including how the economy would adjust to the end of the furlough scheme. 43) In the near term, excess demand was projected to emerge in the August Report projections, as the pickup in demand was projected to continue to be a little more rapid than that of supply. Over 2022, however, as supply growth slowed by a little less than demand growth, excess demand was eroded. Demand and supply returned broadly to balance in the third year of the forecast period. 44) There were two-sided risks around the MPCs assumptions about the degree to which the economy would need to adjust in the medium term in response to the pandemic, and hence its projections for supply growth. One possibility was that the composition of demand would normalise and that any sectoral re-adjustment on the supply side might be relatively quick. Alternatively, a larger reallocation of labour within or across sectors or geographic areas might be required, resulting in more persistent mismatches between supply and demand. 45) Private sector regular pay in the three months to May had been over 7% higher than a year earlier, and annual growth was projected to have peaked at around 8 ½% in 2021 Q2. Adjusted for the impact of the furlough scheme, the changing composition of employment during the pandemic and annual base effects, underlying pay growth appeared to continue to be around pre-Covid rates. 46) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 2.5% in June, above the MPCs 2% target and 0.8 percentage points higher than had been expected in the May Report. Core CPI inflation had also risen further, to 2.3%, as building global input cost pressures had been passed through to some consumer goods prices and, to a lesser degree, the reopening of the economy had led to a pickup in some consumer services and goods prices. 47) CPI inflation was projected to rise temporarily in the near term, to 4% in 2021 Q4, 1.5 percentage points higher than had been expected in the May Report, and owing largely to developments in energy and other goods prices. Above-target inflation was expected to be transitory in the August Report projections, as commodity prices were assumed to stabilise, supply shortages were assumed to ease and global demand to rebalance away from goods and back towards services. As a result, CPI inflation was expected to fall back and was projected to return to close to the 2% target in the medium term. 48) There were two-sided risks around this central path for inflation. On the downside, for example, there could be larger-than-expected supply responses in commodity and other global markets, pushing down on future input prices and import costs. On the upside, current elevated inflationary pressures could potentially lead to some second-round effects on consumer prices. Taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judged that UK inflation expectations remained well anchored. The Committee would continue to monitor the risk that domestic and global demand and cost pressures could affect medium-term inflation expectations. 49) The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 50) The Committees central expectation was that current elevated global and domestic cost pressures would prove transitory. Nonetheless, the economy was projected to experience a more pronounced period of above-target inflation in the near term than had been expected in the May Report. And, alongside temporary constraints on supply, the rapid recovery in demand had eroded spare capacity such that the economy was projected to have a margin of excess demand for a period. In the medium term, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, inflation was projected to fall back to close to the 2% target, and demand and supply were expected to return broadly to balance. 51) The MPC had, since the second half of 2020, had policy guidance in place specifying that it did not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there was clear evidence that significant progress was being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. The Committee discussed whether the conditions of that guidance had now been met, taking account of both the August Report projections and recent developments in economic data. 52) Some members of the Committee judged that, although considerable progress had been made in achieving the conditions of the MPCs existing policy guidance, the conditions were not yet met fully. In particular, they judged that it was not sufficiently clear that the economy was on a path to meet the inflation target sustainably, given the remaining downside risks from Covid, and the judgement of these members that GDP and employment were materially below their medium-term potential. 53) The other members of the Committee judged that the conditions of the existing policy guidance had been met fully, as demonstrated by developments in economic data and the latest central projections for spare capacity and CPI inflation in the August Report, but noted that the guidance had made clear that these had only ever been necessary not sufficient conditions for any future tightening in monetary policy. 54) All members confirmed that in judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee would, as always, focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, including medium-term inflation expectations, rather than factors that were likely to be transient. In particular, the Committee would not put undue weight on capacity pressures that were frictional in nature and likely to be temporary. The Committee would be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding developments in the labour market, and particularly unemployment, wider measures of slack and underlying wage pressures. In addition, there remained two-sided risks around the central path for inflation in the medium term. Risk management considerations continued to have some force. 55) At this meeting, most members of the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy, which included the previously announced  £150 billion increase in the target stock of purchased assets, remained appropriate. 56) For one member, the economic outlook warranted a reduction in the scale of monetary policy stimulus at this MPC meeting. This member preferred to stop the current asset purchase programme as soon as practical after this meeting rather than continue it until around the end of the year, as currently planned. This member judged that, with the existing policy stance, inflation was likely to remain above the 2% target two and three years ahead. This reflected the prospect of a larger and more persistent level of excess demand in the United Kingdom and a greater impact from global cost pressures than in the central forecast in the August Report. Moreover, continuing with asset purchases when CPI inflation was 4% and the output gap was closed, as was likely to be the situation later this year, might cause medium-term inflation expectations to drift higher. A modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting would mitigate these risks, which otherwise might ultimately necessitate a more abrupt subsequent tightening in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment. 57) The Committee judged that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report, some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term. 58) The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 0.1%; The Bank of England should maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion; The Bank of England should continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these purchases at  £875 billion. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the first and second propositions. Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Dave Ramsden, Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe) voted in favour of the third proposition. One member (Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce the target for the stock of UK government bond purchases from  £875 billion to  £830 billion. 59) The existing programme of  £150 billion of UK government bond purchases had started in January and its completion was expected by around the end of 2021. Further details of the planned operational approach to gilt purchases between the August and December MPC meetings were set out in the Market Notice accompanying these minutes. Should market functioning worsen materially, the Bank of England stood ready to increase the pace of purchases to ensure the effective transmission of monetary policy. 60) In addition, and as also described in the Market Notice accompanying these minutes, the Committee agreed to reinvest  £16.6 billion of cash flows associated with the redemptions of the September 2021 gilt held by the Asset Purchase Facility. 61) The Committee would keep the asset purchase programme under review. If needed, there was scope for the Bank of England to re-evaluate the existing technical parameters of the gilt purchase programme. 62) In its February 2021 minutes, the Committee had requested that the PRA should engage with PRA-regulated firms to ensure they commenced preparations in order to be ready to implement a negative Bank Rate at any point after six months. The MPC had also requested that Bank staff should commence internal technical preparations to deliver the option of a tiered system of reserve remuneration that could be ready to be implemented, should it be judged appropriate, alongside a negative Bank Rate. As the Committee had stressed in February, these preparations should not be interpreted as a signal that the setting of a negative Bank Rate was imminent, or in prospect at some specific time. At its August meeting, the Committee had been briefed that technical preparations internally and by PRA-regulated firms had progressed sufficiently that a negative Bank Rate could be implemented by the system as a whole, with or without tiered reserve account remuneration, if warranted. 63) In Box A of the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report, the Committee had set out its updated strategy for the mix of its monetary policy tools and its intended approach to using the instruments in its toolkit to deliver any tightening in the overall stance of policy, should that be required. The path of Bank Rate and the stock of purchased assets over the next few years would depend on economic developments. The overall stance of monetary policy would, as always, be set to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helped sustain growth and employment. 64) Finally, on behalf of the Committee, the Chair expressed his appreciation to Gertjan Vlieghe for his contributions to the work of the MPC since becoming a member in 2015. 65) The following members of the Committee were present: Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Bradley Fried was also present on 2 August, as an observer, for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Banks Court of Directors. \n","20180913\n","The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion.   The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. In the MPCs most recent economic projections, set out in the August Inflation Report, GDP was expected to grow by around 1 ¾% per year on average over the forecast period, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by market yields at that time.   Although modest by historical standards, the projected pace of GDP growth was slightly faster than the diminished rate of supply growth, which averaged around 1 ½% per year.   With a very limited degree of slack remaining, a small margin of excess demand was therefore projected to emerge by late 2019 and build thereafter, feeding through into higher growth in domestic costs than has been seen over recent years.   The contribution of external cost pressures, which has accounted for above-target inflation since the beginning of 2017, was projected to ease over the forecast period.   Taking these influences together, and conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate, CPI inflation remained slightly above 2% through most of the forecast period, reaching the target in the third year. Recent news in UK macroeconomic data has been limited and the MPCs August projections appear to be broadly on track.   UK GDP grew by 0.4% in 2018 Q2 and by 0.6% in the three months to July.   The UK labour market has continued to tighten, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.0% and the number of vacancies rising further.   Regular pay growth has risen further to around 3% on a year earlier.   CPI inflation was 2.5% in July. The global economy still appears to be growing at above-trend rates, although recent developments are likely to have increased downside risks around global growth to some degree.   In emerging market economies, indicators of growth have continued to soften and financial conditions have tightened further, in some cases markedly.   Recent announcements of further protectionist measures by the United States and China, if implemented, could have a somewhat more negative impact on global growth than was anticipated at the time of the August Report. The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal.   Since the Committees previous meeting, there have been indications, most prominently in financial markets, of greater uncertainty about future developments in the withdrawal process. The Committee judges that, were the economy to continue to develop broadly in line with the August Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon.   As before, these projections were conditioned on the expectation of a smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the United Kingdoms eventual trading relationship with the European Union.   At this meeting, the Committee judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.   Any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. Monetary policy summary and minutes Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20210204\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 3 February 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at  £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at  £895 billion. The Committees projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. Covid-19 (Covid) vaccination programmes are under way in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, which has improved the economic outlook. Nevertheless, recent UK and global activity has been affected by an increase in Covid cases, including from newly identified strains of the virus, and the associated reimposition of restrictions. The United Kingdom and European Union also announced a trade agreement, which has applied since 1 January 2021. Global GDP growth slowed in 2020 Q4, as a rise in Covid cases and consequent restrictions to contain the spread of the virus weighed on economic activity. Since the MPCs previous meeting, financial markets have remained resilient. UK GDP is expected to have risen a little in 2020 Q4 to a level around 8% lower than in 2019 Q4. This is materially stronger than expected in the November Report. While the scale and breadth of the Covid restrictions in place at present mean that they are expected to affect activity more than those in 2020 Q4, their impact is not expected to be as severe as in 2020 Q2, during the United Kingdoms first lockdown. GDP is expected to fall by around 4% in 2021 Q1, in contrast to expectations of a rise in the November Report. Labour market indicators remain difficult to interpret. The LFS unemployment rate rose to 5.0% in the three months to November, but other indicators suggest that labour market slack has remained higher than implied by this measure. The Governments employment support schemes are likely to limit significantly the immediate rise in unemployment. A further increase in unemployment is projected over the next few quarters. Average Weekly Earnings growth has been notably stronger than expected in the November Report, although this may overstate underlying pay growth. GDP is projected to recover rapidly towards pre-Covid levels over 2021, as the vaccination programme is assumed to lead to an easing of Covid-related restrictions and peoples health concerns. Projected activity is also supported by the substantial fiscal and monetary policy actions already announced. Further out, the pace of GDP growth slows as the boost from these factors fades. Spare capacity in the economy is eliminated as activity picks up during 2021. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 0.3% in November to 0.6% in December. The weakness of recent outturns largely reflects the direct and indirect effects of Covid on the economy. CPI inflation is expected to rise quite sharply towards the 2% target in the spring, as the reduction in VAT for certain services comes to an end and given developments in energy prices. In the MPCs central projection, conditioned on the market path for interest rates, CPI inflation is projected to be close to 2% over the second and third years of the forecast period. The outlook for the economy remains unusually uncertain. It depends on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond to these developments. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely. If the outlook for inflation weakens, the Committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is necessary to achieve its remit. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. \n","20171214\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.   At its meeting ending on 13 December 2017, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%.   The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion.   The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. In the MPCs most recent economic projections, set out in the November Inflation Report, GDP grew modestly over the next few years, at a pace just above its reduced rate of potential.   Consumption growth remained sluggish in the near term before rising, in line with household incomes.   Net trade was bolstered by the strong global expansion and the past depreciation of sterling.   Business investment, while affected by uncertainties around Brexit, was projected to continue to grow at a modest pace, supported by strong global demand, high rates of profitability, the low cost of capital and limited spare capacity.   Unemployment was expected to remain low throughout the three-year forecast period, and domestic inflationary pressures were projected to pick up gradually as remaining spare capacity was absorbed and wage growth recovered.   Nevertheless, reflecting the diminishing effect of sterlings depreciation, CPI inflation was forecast to decline from around 3% to approach the 2% target by the end of the three-year forecast period. The recent news in the macroeconomic data has been mixed and relatively limited.   Global growth has remained strong.   Domestically, some activity indicators suggest GDP growth in Q4 might be slightly softer than in Q3.   The measures announced in the Autumn Budget will lessen the drag on aggregate demand stemming from fiscal consolidation, relative to previous plans.   The labour market remains tight, and surveys suggest this will continue.   Although it is too early to arrive at a comprehensive view of the effect of Novembers rise in Bank Rate on the economy, the impact on interest rates faced by households and firms has been consistent with previous experience.   CPI inflation was 3.1% in November.   It remains the case that inflation has been pushed above the target by the boost to import prices that resulted from the past depreciation of sterling.   The MPC judges that inflation is likely to be close to its peak, and will decline towards the 2% target in the medium term.   In line with the procedure set out in the MPCs remit, the Governor will be writing an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, accounting for the overshoot relative to the target and explaining the MPCs policy strategy to return inflation sustainably to the target.   This letter will be published alongside the minutes of the February 2018 MPC meeting and the accompanying Inflation Report. Developments regarding the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union  and in particular the reaction of households, businesses and asset prices to them  remain the most significant influence on, and source of uncertainty about, the economic outlook.   The Committee noted the progress in the Article 50 negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union.    In such exceptional circumstances, the MPCs remit specifies that the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. The steady erosion of slack over the past year or so has reduced the degree to which it is appropriate for the MPC to accommodate an extended period of inflation above the target.   Consequently, at its previous meeting, the MPC judged it appropriate to tighten modestly the stance of monetary policy in order to return inflation sustainably to the target, while continuing to provide significant support to jobs and activity.   At this meeting, the Committee voted unanimously to maintain the current monetary stance.   The Committee remains of the view that, were the economy to follow the path expected in the November Inflation Report, further modest increases in Bank Rate would be warranted over the next few years, in order to return inflation sustainably to the target.   Any future increases in Bank Rate are expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.   The Committee will monitor closely the incoming evidence on the evolving economic outlook, including the impact of last months increase in Bank Rate, and stands ready to respond to developments as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Monetary policy summary and minutes - December 2017 Monetary policy summary and minutes \n","20180322\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 21 March 2018, the MPC voted by a majority of 7-2 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion.  In the MPCs most recent projections, set out in the February Inflation Report, GDP was expected to grow by around 1 ¾% per year on average over the forecast period.   While modest by historical standards, that growth rate was expected to exceed the diminished rate of supply growth of the economy, which was projected to be around 1 ½% per year. As a result, a small margin of excess demand was projected to emerge by early 2020 and build thereafter. That pushed up on domestic costs, although CPI inflation fell back gradually as the effects of sterlings past depreciation faded. Inflation remained above the 2% target in the second and third years of the MPCs central projection.  Recent data releases are broadly consistent with the MPCs view of the medium-term outlook as set out in the February Report. The prospects for global GDP growth remain strong, and financial conditions continue to be accommodative, with little persistent effect from the recent financial market volatility. UK GDP growth in the fourth quarter was revised down slightly, to 0.4%, with the composition of demand implying less rotation towards net trade and business investment than anticipated at the time of the February Report. However, early estimates of the expenditure components of GDP are prone to revision, and other indicators of exports and investment point to a stronger picture. The latest activity indicators suggest that the underlying pace of GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018 remains similar to that in the final quarter of 2017.    CPI inflation fell from 3.0% in January to 2.7% in February. Inflation is expected to ease further in the short term although to remain above the 2% target. Pay growth continued to pick up. The unemployment rate remained low in the three months to January. The firming of shorter-term measures of wage growth in recent quarters and a range of survey indicators suggest pay growth will rise further in response to the tightening labour market. This provides increasing confidence that growth in wages and unit labour costs will pick up to target-consistent rates. Developments regarding the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union  and in particular the reaction of households, businesses and asset prices to them  remain the most significant influence on, and source of uncertainty about, the economic outlook. In such exceptional circumstances, the MPCs remit specifies that the Committee must balance any significant trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. The steady absorption of slack has reduced the degree to which it is appropriate for the MPC to accommodate an extended period of inflation above the target. As in February, the best collective judgement of the MPC remains that, given the prospect of excess demand over the forecast period, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period will be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to its target at a more conventional horizon. All members agree that any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. In light of these considerations, seven members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the demands of the MPCs remit. Monetary policy summary and minutes - March 2018 Monetary Policy Committee voting history \n","20170615\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 14 June 2017, the MPC voted by a majority of 5-3 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%.  The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion.  The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. The MPC set out its most recent assessment of the outlook for inflation and activity in the May Inflation Report.  That assessment depended importantly on three main judgements:  that the lower level of sterling continues to boost consumer prices broadly as projected, and without adverse consequences for inflation expectations further ahead;  that regular pay growth remains modest in the near term but picks up significantly over the forecast period;  and that more subdued household spending growth is largely balanced by a pickup in other components of demand. CPI inflation has been pushed above the 2% target by the impact of last years sterling depreciation.  It reached 2.9% in May, above the MPCs expectation.  Inflation could rise above 3% by the autumn, and is likely to remain above the target for an extended period as sterlings depreciation continues to feed through into the prices of consumer goods and services.  The 2 ½% fall in the exchange rate since the May Inflation Report, if sustained, will add to that imported inflationary impetus. In contrast, pay growth has moderated further from already subdued rates, even as the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6%, its lowest in over 40 years. GDP growth declined markedly in the first quarter, in part reflecting weaker household spending.  It remains to be seen how large and persistent this slowdown in consumption will prove.  In recent months, there have been further signs of a slowing housing market and new car registrations have fallen sharply.  Consumer confidence has remained relatively resilient, however, and employment has continued to rise.  Outside the household sector, export indicators have strengthened, probably reflecting both the depreciation of sterling and increasingly robust global demand.  Most surveys of investment intentions have remained above their historic averages.  Surveys of general business activity suggest a modest recovery in GDP growth in the second quarter. Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves towards its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years.  Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth.  For this reason, the MPCs remit specifies that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. The projections that the Committee published in May showed that the economy was expected to operate with a small degree of spare capacity for most of the three-year forecast period, justifying the tolerance of some degree of above-target inflation.  The continued growth of employment could suggest that spare capacity is being eroded, lessening the trade-off that the MPC is required to balance and, all else equal, reducing the MPCs tolerance of above-target inflation.  Looking ahead, key considerations in judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy are the evolution of inflationary pressures, the persistence of weaker consumption and the degree to which it is offset by other components of demand. In light of these considerations, five members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the demands of the MPCs remit.  Three members considered it appropriate to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points.  All members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.  The Committee will continue to monitor closely the incoming evidence, and stands ready to respond to changes in the economic outlook as they unfold to ensure a sustainable return of inflation to the 2% target. Summary and minutes of the meeting \n","20210923\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment.  At its meeting ending on 22 September 2021, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate.  The MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%.  The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion.  The Committee voted by a majority of 7-2 for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these government bond purchases at  £875 billion and so the total target stock of asset purchases at  £895 billion. In the MPCs central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP was projected to recover further over the remainder of the year, with demand growth boosted by a waning impact from Covid-19 (Covid).  There was projected to be a period of excess demand in the near term, before demand and supply were expected to return broadly to balance as demand growth slowed and constraints on supply eased.  CPI inflation was projected to rise temporarily in the near term, to 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and goods prices.  Conditioned on the market path for interest rates, CPI inflation was expected to fall back to close to the 2% target in the medium term. Since the August MPC meeting, the pace of recovery of global activity has showed signs of slowing.  Against a backdrop of robust goods demand and continuing supply constraints, global inflationary pressures have remained strong and there are some signs that cost pressures may prove more persistent.  Some financial market indicators of inflation expectations have risen somewhat, including in the United Kingdom. Bank staff have revised down their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q3 by around 1% since the August Report, leaving the expected level of Q3 GDP around 2 ½% below its pre-Covid level.  This downward revision in part reflects the emergence of some supply constraints on output.  These have been evident in surveys showing historically lengthy supplier delivery times and backlogs of work, significant material and labour shortages in a number of sectors, and lower than normal levels of inventories.  Momentum appears to have picked up in services-orientated sectors where output remains well below pre-Covid levels.  Although official estimates of retail sales have weakened somewhat, other indicators of spending have generally remained at strong levels, as has consumer confidence. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in the three months to July, slightly below the August Report forecast, while HMRC payroll data suggest that employee numbers (which include furloughed jobs) surpassed their 2019 Q4 level in August.  The number of full and part-time furloughed jobs has continued to decline, but, on the basis of the most recent reported number of 1.7 million in July, to a materially lesser degree than estimated in the August Report.  There have been few signs of any increase in redundancies, and the stock of vacancies has increased further, as have indicators of recruitment difficulties.  Bank staffs estimate of underlying pay growth has picked up, to above its pre-pandemic rate. Uncertainty around the outlook for the labour market has therefore increased.  Key questions include how the economy will adjust to the closure of the furlough scheme at the end of September; the extent, impact and duration of any change in unemployment; as well as the degree and persistence of any difficulties in matching available jobs with workers.  The Committee will review these, along with other, developments as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the November Monetary Policy Report, which will also include its periodic assessment of the supply side of the economy. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 2.0% in July to 3.2% in August, compared with the 3.0% figure expected in the August Report, and triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement.  Core inflation also rose to 3.1% in August, its highest rate since November 2011.  While base effects accounted for the majority of the increase in CPI inflation between July and August, global cost pressures have continued to affect UK consumer goods prices.  To a lesser degree, the reopening of the economy has led to a further increase in some consumer services prices.  Indicators of households medium-term inflation expectations have increased in recent months, with the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure at its highest level since 2013 in September. CPI inflation is expected to rise further in the near term, to slightly above 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and goods prices.  The material rise in spot and forward wholesale gas prices since the August Report represents an upside risk to the MPCs inflation projection from April 2022.  Most other indicators of cost pressures have remained elevated.  The Committees central expectation continues to be that current elevated global cost pressures will prove transitory. The MPCs remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework.  The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances.  In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy has been subject to very large shocks.  Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate policy stance, will as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, rather than factors that are likely to be transient. At its previous meeting, the Committee judged that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report, some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term.  Some developments during the intervening period appear to have strengthened that case, although considerable uncertainties remain.  The Committee will be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding developments in the labour market, and particularly unemployment, wider measures of slack and underlying pay pressures; the extent to which businesses pass on wage and other cost increases, as well as medium-term inflation expectations. At this meeting, the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate. 1) Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed:  the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. 2) The global economy had continued to recover and UK-weighted global GDP growth in 2021 Q2 had been broadly in line with expectations at the time of the August Monetary Policy Report.  Global activity was now expected to grow at a slightly slower pace in Q3, however, accounted for largely by weaker growth in the United States and China.  There had also been some early evidence of a rotation in demand from goods to services, with the services PMIs above or in line with the manufacturing PMIs in the United States and the euro area.  Against a backdrop of robust goods demand and continuing supply constraints, global inflationary pressures had remained strong and there were some signs that cost pressures might prove more persistent. 3) Euro-area GDP had picked up by 2.2% in 2021 Q2, stronger than had been expected at the time of the August Report.  The number of Covid cases appeared to have stabilised in most euro-area countries alongside a recovery in mobility and continued progress in vaccination programmes.  Turning to Q3, the euro-area manufacturing PMI had remained well above its historical average, although it had fallen back to its weakest level in six months in August, with supply constraints affecting activity.  The services PMI had also remained elevated.  Bank staff now expected euro-area GDP growth in Q3 to be somewhat stronger than at the time of the August Report, but the level of GDP was expected to remain below its pre-Covid level. 4) US GDP had risen by 1.6% in 2021 Q2, slightly weaker than had been expected at the time of the August Report.  In the labour market, non-farm payrolls had increased by 235,000 in August, a much slower pace than the average of around 1 million jobs that had been added over the previous two months.  The unemployment rate had nevertheless fallen to 5.2%.  Although Covid cases had now started to fall across most US regions, they had remained elevated and the pace of the vaccination rollout had slowed considerably in recent months, as some southern states in particular had seen a lower take-up.  But mobility and activity had held up in these states despite this, consistent with the link between cases and activity having weakened.  Real personal consumption spending had fallen by 0.1% in July, with services spending continuing to recover relative to goods spending.  The most recent high-frequency spending data had also pointed to some slowdown in consumer spending, although they had remained above their pre-Covid levels.  Overall, US GDP in Q3 was expected to rise by somewhat less than at the time of the August Report. 5) Chinese activity had slowed in July, with the re-imposition of localised lockdowns in response to outbreaks of Covid weighing on mobility.  Official data and business surveys had pointed to a further moderation in activity in August, and GDP in 2021 Q3 was expected to rise by slightly less than at the time of the August Report. 6) The recovery in other large Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) had been weaker than expected at the time of the August Report, accounted for particularly by the impact on GDP of the delta variant-driven second wave in India.  Covid cases in these EMEs had generally fallen in recent months and there had been an increase in the pace of vaccination rollouts in some of these economies, although vaccination rates had still remained below the levels seen in most advanced economies.  Indicators of economic mobility had generally held up across EMEs recently, even when Covid cases had risen. 7) Global inflationary pressures had remained strong.  Manufacturing input and output prices had continued to rise sharply, albeit at marginally slower rates.  Oil prices had remained elevated compared to their pre-Covid levels, with the Brent oil spot price around $74 per barrel.  Wholesale gas prices had risen sharply in Europe and Asia, driven by a combination of strong global demand and a range of supply constraints, including a low level of inventories after an unusually long and cold winter in Europe, as well as a lower-than-usual availability of wind energy in recent weeks.  Non-energy commodity prices, in aggregate, had been largely unchanged.  Shipping costs had continued to rise, with spot rates rising particularly sharply on certain routes.  The strength in shipping costs had continued to reflect a range of factors, including strong global goods demand, as well as supply chain disruptions such as congestion and Covid-related closures at some large ports.  Supplier delivery times had continued to rise.  Supply conditions had appeared to have improved slightly in some sectors such as semiconductor production, although it would take some time for previous order backlogs to clear.  Global containerised trade flows had continued to recover and world trade volumes had been 6.5% above pre-pandemic levels in 2021 Q2. 8) In the euro area, twelve-month headline HICP inflation had risen to 3.0% in August, from 2.2% in July, stronger than had been expected at the time of the August Report.  Core inflation had also risen to 1.6% from 0.7%, accounted for in part by a substantial increase in clothing and footwear inflation. 9) US CPI inflation had remained elevated in August, although it had eased slightly to 5.3% in August from a 13-year high of 5.4% in June and July.  Headline PCE inflation had picked up a little further to 4.2% in July, and core PCE inflation had remained unchanged at 3.6%.  The rise in headline inflation had primarily been driven by sectors that were sensitive to the reopening of the US economy.  But there had been some signs that price pressures in other sectors were easing.  For example, the contribution to inflation of used cars prices and other durable goods prices had eased in the past couple of months. 10) Since the Committees previous meeting, advanced-economy financial market prices had generally moved within a narrow range.  Equity prices and corporate bond spreads had changed little, while shorter-term and longer-term government bond yields had increased slightly.  Most recently, global equity prices had been more volatile, in part driven by the financial distress at Evergrande Group, one of Chinas largest property developers. 11) Market implied measures of advanced-economy policy rates had increased slightly since the Committees previous meeting.  In the United Kingdom, increases in the level of Bank Rate to 25 basis points and 50 basis points were now expected in May 2022 and December 2022 respectively, compared to August 2022 and February 2024 at the time of the Committees previous meeting.  Market expectations of the first 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate in the United States had been brought forward to February 2023 from June 2023.  At its meeting on 9 September, the ECB Governing Council had decided to reduce moderately the pace of asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme.  The Governing Council had left its key policy rates unchanged. 12) Some financial market indicators of inflation expectations had risen somewhat, including in the United Kingdom.  Near-term measures of inflation compensation, such as the one-year inflation swap rate, one year forward, had risen substantially in the United Kingdom since the Committees previous meeting.  The driver of this movement appeared to be the stronger than expected CPI inflation outturn.  Five-year inflation swap rates, five years forward, an indicator of medium-term inflation expectations, had increased slightly and were around 20 basis points above their 2019 average. 13) Real yields implied by advanced-economy longer-term government bonds had fallen substantially since their recent peak in March 2021, and were now significantly lower than their pre-pandemic levels.  Alongside this, advanced-economy equity prices had increased materially since the beginning of this year, such that, in some large advanced economies, they had increased significantly above their pre-pandemic levels. 14) Market contacts had put forward several possible explanations for this constellation of asset prices.  Some had attributed low real yields primarily to expectations of monetary policy, which could remain highly accommodative if central banks looked through any transitory increases in inflation, while also supporting risky asset prices.  These contacts had expected real rates to rise over time, with a range of views around how gradually this might occur.  Other contacts had attributed low real yields to a more pessimistic outlook for medium-term global growth than had appeared to be incorporated into equity valuations. 15) The sterling effective exchange rate had been broadly stable since the previous MPC meeting. 16) Mortgage credit conditions in the United Kingdom had eased further, with a further fall in lending spreads on most mortgage products.  Spreads on products with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios lower than or equal to 75% were now similar to spreads in January 2020, while spreads on products with LTV ratios higher than 75% had remained above their January 2020 levels.  The number of mortgage products available had continued to improve, with availability for products with low LTV ratios now similar to pre-pandemic levels, although availability for products with high LTV ratios had remained below pre-pandemic levels.  Supervisory intelligence suggested that lenders had become more optimistic about the economic outlook, while bank wholesale funding spreads had fallen over recent months and ring-fenced banks had ample liquidity from strong deposit growth. 17) Credit conditions for unsecured borrowing by households and for lending to small and medium-sized enterprises had changed little since the Committees previous meeting and spreads had remained below the MPCs forecasts made earlier this year. 18) Since the MPCs previous meeting, the number of hospitalisations of Covid-19 (Covid) patients and deaths within 28 days of testing positive for Covid had tended to rise in the United Kingdom, although the number of Covid cases had started to fall back again most recently.  The number of people that had been asked to self-isolate temporarily through various channels had declined sharply following a change in guidance in August that meant that those people who had had two doses of a Covid vaccine no longer had to isolate if they came into contact with someone who had tested positive for the virus.  The UK Government had recently announced its autumn and winter plan for responding to Covid, including that all children aged 12 to 15  would be offered one dose of a Covid vaccine, and that all adults over 50 and those that were clinically vulnerable would be offered a booster jab.  Covid-related restrictions on international travel had also been relaxed recently. 19) According to the ONSs first quarterly estimate, UK GDP had risen by 4.8% in 2021 Q2, close to the projection incorporated into the August Monetary Policy Report for the quarter as a whole.  That had left the level of GDP around 4 ½% below its pre-Covid level in 2019 Q4.  Within the expenditure components, household consumption had been estimated to have risen by 7.3% following the reopening of the retail and hospitality sectors through the second quarter, although that had been a somewhat weaker increase than expected in the August Report.  Business investment, which was often subject to revision, had also risen by less than had been expected, by 2.4% and had remained around 15% below its pre-Covid level.  Government consumption had increased by over 6%, as education output had rebounded due to the recovery in pupil attendance after earlier restrictions had been lifted. 20) Ahead of the MPCs next meeting, the ONS would release Blue Book-consistent revisions to GDP as part of the Quarterly National Accounts published on 30 September, including significant methodological changes such as the introduction of double deflation and improvements to deflators for items such as telecommunications and clothing.  Some of these changes were expected to raise pre-pandemic economic growth rates. 21) Official output data for June and July had been somewhat weaker than expected in the August Report, with monthly growth rates of 1.0% and 0.1% respectively, implying that the level of GDP had been around 3 ½% below its 2019 Q4 level in the middle of the year.  The downside news appeared to have reflected signs that bottlenecks in supply chains and labour shortages had started to affect output, particularly in the manufacturing and construction sectors, combined with a slower-than-expected recovery in demand in some consumer-facing services. 22) A further recovery in activity appeared to be underway in components of output that had remained well below their pre-Covid levels to date, such as some consumer-facing services, and transport and workplace-related services.  For example, faster indicators of the use of public transport and the number of flights had risen over recent weeks.  And there was some evidence to suggest spending on entertainment and recreational events had increased, as restrictions had loosened further.  Education output was also likely to have risen towards its normal level.  Taken together, these components were judged likely to account for a large part of the GDP growth expected in 2021 Q3. 23) Other indicators of household spending had generally remained at strong levels, as had consumer confidence.  Although official estimates of retail sales volumes had fallen by 0.9% in August, the level of sales had remained over 4% above its pre-Covid level.  Food store sales had fallen, while faster indicators of restaurant spending had picked up. Housing activity indicators had remained robust, including mortgage approvals for house purchase.  Although the July UK House Price Index had unwound almost all of its record rise in June, perhaps related to the timing of the tapering of the temporary stamp duty cut in England and Northern Ireland, other timelier house price data had picked up further. 24) It appeared likely that the impact of supply constraints on output would prove more persistent.  Supplier delivery times had continued to lengthen materially in the manufacturing and construction sectors according to the latest PMI surveys.  And over half of the respondents to the latest CBI Industrial Trends survey had reported that materials or components were a factor limiting production over the next three months, with about a third of respondents noting that skilled labour was also a limiting factor, both of which were close to historical series highs.  Supply chain issues had led respondents to the latest CBIs Distributive Trades survey to report the lowest level of retail inventories, relative to expected sales, on record.  Backlogs of work had also risen according to that component of the services PMI, linked primarily to shortages of key staff.  Intelligence from the Banks Agents suggested that, against a backdrop of strong demand, it might take some quarters for supply issues to be resolved in some cases.  Separately, recent high spot wholesale gas prices had significantly affected the production plans of some sectors. 25) Overall, Bank staff had revised down their expectations for 2021 Q3 GDP growth from 2.9% at the time of the August Report to 2.1%, in part reflecting the emergence of some supply constraints on output.  That would leave the level of Q3 GDP around 2 ½% below its pre-Covid level. 26) Alongside the launch of Spending Review 2021 on 7 September, the Government had announced a new, Health and Social Care Levy from April 2022, the proceeds of which would be used for spending on health and social care.  This would be based on an increase in National Insurance Contributions for all working adults and a rise in dividend tax rates.  The overall envelope for core day-to-day departmental spending was otherwise assumed to follow the path set out at spring Budget 2021.  The Government had also announced that the state pension triple lock would be suspended for fiscal year 2022-23.  The Spending Review would conclude on 27 October alongside both an autumn Budget, and an updated economic and fiscal forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. 27) The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6% in the three months to July, slightly below the expectations in the August Monetary Policy Report.  The unemployment rate had remained 0.8 percentage points above its 2019 Q4 level of 3.8%.  LFS employment had grown by 0.6% in the three months to July, slightly above expectations at the time of the August Report.  HMRC payroll data suggested that employee numbers had increased by 241,000 in August and had surpassed their 2019 Q4 level, although these data were prone to revision.  The inactivity rate had fallen to 36.7% in the three months to July and had unwound around one fifth of its increase over the course of the pandemic. 28) HMRC administrative data suggested that around 1.7 million jobs, just under 7% of private sector jobs, had been furloughed on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) in July, compared to around 2 million jobs furloughed in June.  This was a materially higher number of jobs furloughed than had been assumed at the time of the August Report, in part possibly reflecting the downside news in GDP growth over that period.  Additionally, the reweighting of the ONSs Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) had led to a substantial upward revision to the estimated share of private sector jobs furloughed, relative to the data that had been available at the time of the August Report.  Recent BICS data suggested that the number of jobs furloughed had declined to around 6% of private sector jobs over the two weeks to 5 September.  Staff estimates suggested that just under half of those jobs furloughed had been on a flexible form of furlough that allowed those employees to have undertaken some work with their employer.  The proportion of salary for furloughed hours covered by the Government had been tapered progressively, from 80% to 70% in July and to 60% from 1 August, with employers required to top up to 80% since July.  The CJRS would end on 30 September 2021. 29) Indicators of redundancies had remained subdued in the run-up to the end of the CJRS.  The level of LFS redundancies had fallen in the three months to July, and the redundancy rate had decreased to 3.4%, around  ½ percentage point below pre-pandemic levels.  HR1 notifications, a statutory requirement that recorded the advance notification of planned redundancies of 20 or more staff at a single establishment, had remained low, even as the relevant statutory consultation periods overlapped with the end date of the CJRS.  Smaller businesses had been disproportionate users of the furlough scheme, however, and by definition were not required to make HR1 notifications.  The BICS data had not pointed to an increase in planned redundancies by small businesses over the next three months, although intelligence from the Banks Agents had highlighted a risk of some micro businesses, which employed only one or two staff, closing permanently upon the CJRSs closure. 30) Indicators of labour demand had remained strong and the labour market appeared to have tightened further.  The stock of job vacancies had risen above 1 million in August, surpassing the previous record set in July.  The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had also risen rapidly, and had surpassed its 2019 average on a single month basis.  The REC index of staff availability had tightened at a record pace in August.  Intelligence from the Banks Agents suggested that recruitment difficulties had become more widespread and acute in recent months.  Agents contacts had attributed labour shortages to a combination of factors, including demand recovering more quickly than expected and a reduction in the availability of EU workers.  The shortage of Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers had been exacerbated by an ageing workforce and a backlog of licence testing. 31) Private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had risen by 7.8% in the three months to July on a year earlier, compared to 8.4% in the three months to June.  AWE growth had continued to be boosted by compositional effects, given that job losses had been skewed towards lower-paid employees during the pandemic.  AWE growth had also been pushed up mechanically by the CJRS recently, with just under 7% of private sector jobs having been furloughed in July, compared to around 23% in July 2020.  The CJRS had been a drag on measured pay growth over the pandemic period prior to May.  Adjusted for the mechanical effects of the CJRS and changes in composition, Bank staff estimated that private sector regular pay growth had been around 4%, above pre-pandemic rates.  The REC Report on Jobs permanent staff salaries index, which measured the monthly pay growth of new permanent hires, had increased to its highest level on record and had pointed to robust pay growth of new hires.  The Banks Agents contacts had reported an increase in pay settlements recently.  Their contacts had also reported that pay increases had been significantly higher for workers with skills in particularly short supply, such as HGV drivers, while the use of one-off bonuses to retain staff had become more widespread. 32) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 2.0% in July to 3.2% in August.  As the inflation rate in August had been above 3%, an exchange of letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer was being published alongside these minutes.  Core inflation had also risen from 1.8% in July to 3.1% in August, its highest rate since November 2011.  The headline CPI outturn for August had been 0.2 percentage points above the projection in the August Report.  That upside news had been accounted for largely by recreational and audio-visual goods, food and accommodation services. 33) Base effects had accounted for the majority of the increase in twelve-month inflation between July and August.  The base effects from last years Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which had dragged on prices in August last year, and the temporarily reduced VAT rate for hospitality, holiday accommodation and attractions dropping out of the annual calculation, had largely accounted for a rise in services inflation to a four-year high.  Additionally, other items, such as clothing and footwear and airfares had grown at below average rates in August last year. 34) Global supply bottlenecks had continued to affect UK consumer goods prices.  Some consumer goods markets had also been affected indirectly by supply bottlenecks.  For example, continuing semiconductor shortages had disrupted new car production, which had led to an increase in demand in the used car market.  Twelve-month used car price inflation had risen to 18.3% in August. 35) The reopening of the economy had led to a pickup in some consumer services prices.  Recent monthly price increases had been particularly pronounced, relative to historical averages, for those services most directly affected by previous restrictions, such as restaurants recreational and accommodation services. 36) The Committee discussed the near-term outlook for consumer prices.  CPI inflation was expected to rise further temporarily, to slightly above 4% in 2021 Q4, slightly higher than the projection in the August Report. 37) Around half of the near-term projected above-target inflation was expected to be accounted for by elevated energy price inflation.  The projected contribution of energy prices from October 2021 reflected a base effect as well as Ofgems most recent announced increases in the standard variable tariff caps on retail gas and electricity prices.  Spot and forward wholesale gas prices had risen materially since the publication of the August Report, against a backdrop of strong demand and some supply disruption.  This could represent a significant upside risk to the MPCs inflation projection from April 2022, when Ofgem next updated its retail energy price caps based on the relevant forward contracts, and meant that CPI inflation would remain slightly above 4% into 2022 Q2, all else equal. 38) Core goods inflation was expected to remain above pre-pandemic averages, accounting for most of the remainder of the projected above-target inflation.   In contrast to much of the pandemic period, services inflation was expected to rise slightly, to rates close to pre-Covid averages, which in part reflected a continued recovery of activity in consumer-facing services, as well as the tapered rise in VAT on hospitality, holiday accommodation and attractions from October.   Most indicators of cost pressures had remained elevated.   Manufacturers output prices, excluding food and energy, had grown at an annualised rate of close to 10% in the three months to August.   Survey-based measures of output and input price inflation, such as the PMIs, had remained at around their recent historically high levels.   Contacts of the Banks Agents had reported that there had been more signs of cost pass-through in the manufacturing and construction sectors recently.   These contacts had also reported some signs of firms passing on some labour cost increases in labour-intensive sectors. 39) Indicators of households medium-term inflation expectations had increased in recent months, with the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure at its highest level since 2013 in September. The Bank/Kantar five-year ahead measure of households inflation expectations had also increased slightly, but was now around its historical average.  There was the potential for short-term measures of households expectations to rise further in the coming months, as they had tended to move with official inflation outturns previously.  Such movements in these short-term measures would not be inconsistent with household inflation expectations remaining anchored.  The August Decision Maker Panel had reported an increase in companies one-year ahead own-price inflation expectations.  Professional forecasters, on average, expected less of a rise in inflation in the short term than the August Report projection, according to the latest HM Treasury survey of independent forecasters. 40) The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 41) In the MPCs central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report, UK GDP had been projected to recover further over the remainder of the year, with demand growth boosted by a waning impact from Covid-19 (Covid).  There had been projected to be a period of excess demand in the near term, before demand and supply had been expected to return broadly to balance as demand growth slowed and constraints on supply eased.  CPI inflation had been projected to rise temporarily in the near term, to 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and goods prices.  Conditioned on the market path for interest rates, CPI inflation had been expected to fall back to close to the 2% target in the medium term. 42) The Committee reviewed recent developments, including the extent to which they had been in line with the projections in the August Report. 43) Since the August MPC meeting, the pace of recovery of global activity had showed signs of slowing.  Euro-area GDP growth in 2021 Q2 had been higher than expected at the time of the August Report, and was now expected to be somewhat stronger in Q3 as well.  Developments in US GDP had shown the opposite pattern, although the link between Covid cases and activity there had continued to weaken.  Growth in China and other large Emerging Market Economies had also weakened somewhat.  There had been some early evidence of a rotation in demand from goods to services, with the services PMIs above or in line with the manufacturing PMIs in the United States and the euro area recently. 44) Against a backdrop of robust goods demand and continuing supply constraints, global inflationary pressures had remained strong and there were some signs that cost pressures might prove more persistent.  Oil prices had remained elevated and global shipping costs had continued to rise.  Wholesale gas prices had risen substantially across Europe.  Supply conditions appeared to have improved slightly in the global semiconductors sector, although it would take some time for previous order backlogs to clear.  Headline and core consumer price inflation had risen in the euro area and had remained elevated in the United States. 45) Since the Committees previous meeting, global equity prices and corporate bond spreads had generally changed little, while shorter-term and longer-term government bond yields had increased slightly, including in the United Kingdom.  Mortgage credit conditions in the United Kingdom had eased further, with a further fall in lending spreads on most mortgage products. 46) As of 22 September 2021, the total stock of assets held in the Asset Purchase Facility had reached  £852 billion, including  £108 billion of the  £150 billion programme of UK government bond purchases announced on 5 November 2020. 47) Bank staff had revised down their expectations for the level of UK GDP in 2021 Q3 by around 1% since the August Report, leaving the expected level of Q3 GDP around 2 ½% below its pre-Covid level.  This downward revision in part reflected the emergence of some supply constraints on output.  These had been evident in surveys showing historically lengthy supplier delivery times and backlogs of work, significant material and labour shortages in a number of sectors, and lower than normal levels of inventories.  Momentum appeared to have picked up in services-orientated sectors, where output had remained well below pre-Covid levels.  Although official estimates of retail sales had weakened somewhat, other indicators of spending had generally remained at strong levels, as had consumer confidence. 48) Bank staffs initial assessment was that recent fiscal announcements were likely to be broadly neutral for the growth outlook, as higher spending on health and social care would be funded by an increase in National Insurance Contributions and a rise in dividend tax rates.  The overall envelope for core day-to-day departmental spending was otherwise assumed to follow the path set out at spring Budget 2021.  Ahead of the Committees next meeting, the Government would conclude its Spending Review on 27 October alongside both an autumn Budget, and an updated economic and fiscal forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. 49) The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6% in the three months to July, slightly below the August Report forecast, while HMRC payroll data suggested that employee numbers (which included furloughed jobs) had surpassed their 2019 Q4 level in August.  The inactivity rate had fallen in the three months to July and had unwound around one fifth of its increase over the course of the pandemic. 50) The number of full and part-time furloughed jobs had continued to decline, but to a materially lesser degree than had been estimated in the August Report.  That surprise could only partly be explained by downside news in GDP growth.  HMRC administrative data suggested that around 1.7 million jobs, just under 7% of private sector jobs, had been furloughed on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) in July, with just under half of those jobs on a flexible form of furlough that allowed those employees to have undertaken some work with their employer.  Recent Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) data suggested that the number of jobs furloughed had declined to around 6% of private sector jobs over the two weeks to 5 September.  The end of the CJRS on 30 September would remove this support to incomes. 51) There had been few signs of any increase in redundancies, and the stock of vacancies had increased further, as had indicators of recruitment difficulties.  Contacts of the Banks Agents had attributed labour shortages to a combination of factors, including demand recovering more quickly than expected and a reduction in the availability of EU workers.  The shortage of Heavy Goods Vehicle drivers had been exacerbated by an ageing workforce and a backlog of licence testing. 52) Bank staffs estimate of underlying pay growth had picked up, to above its pre-pandemic rate.  The Banks Agents contacts had reported that pay increases had been significantly higher for workers with skills in particularly short supply, while the use of one-off bonuses to retain staff had become more widespread. 53) The Committee discussed explanations for the surprisingly high number of jobs that were still recorded as being furloughed, despite other signals of a rapidly tightening labour market.  One possibility was that some companies had continued to use the CJRS to hoard labour ahead of an expected recovery in demand, even though the cost of that strategy had increased recently.  Although some of these companies might choose to let staff go at the end of the scheme, others might be sufficiently confident of future demand to retain them.  A substantial proportion of furloughed jobs had been at very small companies, including those with a single employee, for which the decision to reopen or not might depend more on idiosyncratic conditions.  To the extent that some businesses had not yet brought staff back fully to their pre-Covid workplaces, this might have prolonged furlough in other businesses that supported these workplaces through ancillary goods and services.  It was also possible that a greater number of furloughed workers had been able to find second jobs with alternative employers, or had expanded the scope of existing second jobs, which were allowable under the CJRS.  These workers would probably not become unemployed at the end of the scheme, although, if they accounted for a large proportion of those still furloughed, it would make current high vacancy rates more difficult to explain. 54) Another hypothesis was that, due to shifts in the pattern of demand during the pandemic, those on furlough were not suitable matches for the job vacancies currently available.  Although vacancies had risen across the economy, including in sectors with a high number of furloughed jobs, there could be mismatch at a more granular level across companies within the same sector.  In that case, any increase in unemployment following the end of the CJRS might, at least in part, be more structural than cyclical. 55) Overall, the Committee judged that uncertainty around the outlook for the labour market had increased.  Key questions included how the economy would adjust to the closure of the furlough scheme at the end of September; the extent, impact and duration of any change in unemployment;  as well as the degree and persistence of any difficulties in matching available jobs with workers. 56) The Committee would review these, along with other, developments as part of its forthcoming forecast round ahead of the November Monetary Policy Report, which would also include its periodic assessment of the supply side of the economy.  Ahead of the next MPC meeting, official data on furlough numbers would only be available for August, although additional, timelier information would be available from the BICS, other surveys and the Banks Agents, including on any potential increase in redundancies.  Official labour market data for October, covering the period following the closure of the CJRS, would not be published until after the November MPC meeting. 57) Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 2.0% in July to 3.2% in August, compared with the 3.0% figure expected in the August Report, and had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside this monetary policy announcement.  Core inflation had also risen to 3.1% in August, its highest rate since November 2011.  While base effects had accounted for the majority of the increase in CPI inflation between July and August, global cost pressures had continued to affect UK consumer goods prices.  To a lesser degree, the reopening of the economy had led to a further increase in some consumer services prices. 58) CPI inflation was expected to rise further in the near term, to slightly above 4% in 2021 Q4, owing largely to developments in energy and goods prices.  The material rise in spot and forward wholesale gas prices since the August Report represented an upside risk to the MPCs inflation projection from April 2022, and meant that CPI inflation could remain above 4% into 2022 Q2, all else equal.  Most other indicators of cost pressures had remained elevated.  The Committees central expectation continued to be that current elevated global cost pressures would prove transitory.  Indeed, there were still good reasons to expect material supply responses in commodity and other global markets, pushing down on future input prices and import costs.  That said, should the pandemic reinforce the retrenchment of globalisation, there would be less scope for these factors to create future disinflationary pressures.  And current elevated inflationary pressures could potentially lead to some second-round effects on consumer prices. 59) Some financial market indicators of inflation expectations had risen somewhat, including in the United Kingdom.  The UK five-year inflation swap rate, five years forward was around 20 basis points above its 2019 average.  Indicators of UK households medium-term inflation expectations had increased in recent months, with the Citi/YouGov five-to-ten year ahead measure at its highest level since 2013 in September.  The Bank/Kantar five-year ahead measure of households inflation expectations had also increased slightly, but was now around its historical average.  Taking together the full range of evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judged that UK inflation expectations remained well anchored.  But given recent developments, the Committee would monitor very closely the risk that domestic and global demand and cost pressures could further affect medium-term inflation expectations. 60) The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 61) The MPC had, since the second half of 2020, had policy guidance in place specifying that it did not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there was clear evidence that significant progress was being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably.  There remained a range of views on the Committee about whether the conditions of that guidance were met, but all members agreed that the previous formal guidance was no longer useful in the present situation. 62) The MPCs remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework.  The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances.  In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy had been subject to very large shocks.  Given the lag between changes in monetary policy and their effects on inflation, the Committee, in judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, would as always focus on the medium-term prospects for inflation, rather than factors that were likely to be transient. 63) At this meeting, most members of the Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy, which included the previously announced  £150 billion increase in the target stock of purchased assets, remained appropriate.  There was a range of views about the most likely near-term path of unemployment following the closure of the furlough scheme.  However, all members in this group agreed that the outlook for the labour market, and hence underlying inflationary pressures, was particularly uncertain, and that some of this uncertainty should be resolved over coming months.  Hence, there was a high option value in waiting for that additional information before deciding if and when a tightening in monetary policy might be warranted.  If there were signs that the unemployment rate was increasing significantly following the end of the CJRS, it might take somewhat longer to assess the extent to which that rise was structural or cyclical, and, if structural and pushing down on effective supply in the economy, for how long that might persist. 64) For members in this group, it remained likely that inflation would fall back in the medium term in line with the projection in the August Report, as supply bottlenecks were cleared, demand growth eased, and companies pricing power moderated.  On one view, abstracting from current constraints on effective supply, GDP remained well below its medium-term potential level and monetary policy could have a role in sustaining demand, with a view to reducing the degree of medium-term scarring.  On another view, the economy had shown further signs of normalising recently and demand could remain strong even while supply constraints proved more long-lasting.  CPI inflation had continued to surprise on the upside, some indicators of cost pressures appeared somewhat more persistent and financial market inflation break-evens had continued to rise gradually.  Different members placed different weights on these arguments.  For all members in this group, monetary policy would at some point need to start to unwind some of its post-pandemic stimulus. 65) All members in this group agreed that any future initial tightening of monetary policy should be implemented by an increase in Bank Rate, even if that tightening became appropriate before the end of the existing UK government bond asset purchase programme. 66) For two members, the economic outlook warranted a tightening in the monetary policy stance at this MPC meeting.  There was increasing evidence from a range of global and domestic cost and price indicators that inflationary pressures were likely to persist.  Record vacancy levels and the pace of underlying wage growth were evidence of ongoing tightness in labour market conditions, alongside other signs of capacity pressures.  These members judged that, with the existing policy stance, inflation was likely to remain above the 2% target in the medium term.  This reflected a greater impact from cost pressures, and the prospect of a larger and more persistent level of excess demand in the United Kingdom than in the central forecast in the August Report. 67) These two members preferred to stop the current asset purchase programme as soon as practical after this meeting rather than continuing it until around the end of the year, as currently planned.  Continuing with asset purchases when CPI inflation was above 3% and the output gap was closed might cause medium-term inflation expectations to drift up further.  A decision to curtail the asset purchase programme at this meeting would imply a modest policy tightening and mitigate that risk, which might otherwise ultimately necessitate a more abrupt subsequent tightening in policy and hence a greater adjustment in growth and employment.  It would demonstrate the Committees commitment to returning inflation to target in the medium term and ensuring that medium-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. 68) At its previous meeting, the Committee had judged that, should the economy evolve broadly in line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report, some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period was likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term.  Some developments during the intervening period appeared to have strengthened that case, although considerable uncertainties remained.  The Committee would be monitoring closely the incoming evidence regarding developments in the labour market, and particularly unemployment, wider measures of slack and underlying pay pressures; the extent to which businesses passed on wage and other cost increases, as well as medium-term inflation expectations. 69) The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Bank Rate should be maintained at 0.1%; The Bank of England should maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £20 billion; The Bank of England should continue with its existing programme of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the stock of these purchases at  £875 billion. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the first and second propositions. Seven members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the third proposition.  Two members (Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to reduce the target for the stock of UK government bond purchases from  £875 billion to  £840 billion. 70) The existing programme of  £150 billion of UK government bond purchases had started in January and its completion was expected by around the end of 2021.  Further details of the planned operational approach to gilt purchases between the August and December MPC meetings had been set out in the Market Notice accompanying the August 2021 minutes.  Should market functioning worsen materially, the Bank of England stood ready to increase the pace of purchases to ensure the effective transmission of monetary policy. 71) The Committee would keep the asset purchase programme under review.  If needed, there was scope for the Bank of England to re-evaluate the existing technical parameters of the gilt purchase programme. 72) Consistent with the Committees previous guidance, the MPC agreed to reinvest the cash flows associated with reductions in the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases held by the Asset Purchase Facility back into eligible corporate bonds, commencing in November 2021.  As announced in March, this reinvestment programme would be the first to take the climate impact of the issuers of bonds into account.  Further details of reinvestment operations would be published in a Market Notice nearer the time, alongside details of how the Banks approach to greening the portfolio would be implemented this year. 73) The following members of the Committee were present: Tom Josephs was present as the Treasury representative. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Dorothy Thompson was also present on 15 and 17 September, as an observer, for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in her role as a member of the Banks Court of Directors. \n","20220203\n","The Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 2 February 2022, the MPC voted by a majority of 5-4 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%. Those members in the minority preferred to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets. The Committee also voted unanimously for the Bank of England to begin to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets and by a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. The Committees updated central projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. The projections are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises to around 1 ½% by the middle of 2023. Wholesale energy prices are assumed to follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain constant beyond that, in contrast to futures curves, which are downward sloping over coming years. There are material risks around this assumption. Global and UK activity returned to their pre-Covid-19 (Covid) levels towards the end of last year. The emergence of the Omicron variant is expected to have depressed activity somewhat in December and January. But its economic impact is likely to be limited and of short duration, and UK GDP is expected to recover in February and March such that output returns to its pre-pandemic level once again by the end of the first quarter. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in the three months to November, and is expected to fall further in the near term, to 3.8% in 2022 Q1. Beyond the near term, UK GDP growth is expected to slow to subdued rates. The main reason for that is the adverse impact of higher global energy and tradable goods prices on UK real aggregate income and spending. As a result, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5% and excess supply builds to around 1% by the end of the forecast period. Underlying earnings growth is estimated to have remained above pre-pandemic rates, and is expected to strengthen over the coming year, to around 4 ¾%. This is consistent with the results of the Banks Agents annual pay survey, with the tight labour market, and with some temporary upward pressure on wage settlements from higher price inflation. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 5.1% in November to 5.4% in December, almost 1 percentage point higher than expected at the time of the November Report. Inflation is expected to increase further in coming months, to close to 6% in February and March, before peaking at around 7 ¼% in April. This projected peak is around 2 percentage points higher than expected in the November Report. The projected overshoot of inflation relative to the 2% target mainly reflects global energy and tradable goods prices. The further rise in energy futures prices meant that Ofgems utility price caps were expected to be substantially higher at the reset in April 2022. Core goods CPI inflation is also expected to rise further, due to the impact of global bottlenecks on tradable goods prices. In the February Report central projection, upward pressures on CPI inflation are expected to dissipate over time, as global energy prices are assumed to remain constant after six months, and as global bottlenecks ease and tradable goods prices fall back a little. Underlying wage growth is also projected to ease from 2023, as the labour market loosens gradually and inflation declines. Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPCs current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation is projected to fall back to a little above the 2% target in two years time and to below the target by a greater margin in three years. In an alternative scenario that is conditioned on energy prices following forward curves throughout the forecast period and as set out in the February Report, excess supply is around  ½ percentage point lower in the medium term than in the MPCs central projection, and CPI inflation is around  ¾ percentage point below the 2% target in two and three years time. The MPCs remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy has been subject to very large and repeated shocks. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent, the sharp rises in prices of global energy and tradable goods of which the United Kingdom is a net importer will necessarily weigh on UK real aggregate income and spending. This is something monetary policy is unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy is to ensure that, as such a real economic adjustment occurs, it does so consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. Given the current tightness of the labour market and continuing signs of greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures, the Committee judges that an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points is warranted at this meeting. Consistent with the MPCs guidance set out in the August 2021 Report, the Committee agrees at this meeting that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any future maturities falling due from its stock of UK government bond purchases. This reflects the MPCs intention to reduce its holdings of government bonds in a gradual and predictable manner. In addition, the Committee agrees that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any maturities falling due from its stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, and that it should initiate a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. The decision to initiate the programme of corporate bond sales reflects the specific characteristics of the corporate bond market and the MPCs involvement in it, and should not be taken as a signal regarding the commencement, scale or duration of any potential future UK government bond sales programme. The Committee reaffirms that it will consider beginning the process of actively selling UK government bonds only once Bank Rate has risen to at least 1%, and depending on economic circumstances at the time. The Committee also reaffirms its preference in most circumstances to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The extent of any further tightening in monetary policy will depend on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The MPC judges that, if the economy develops broadly in line with the February Report central projections, some further modest tightening in monetary policy is likely to be appropriate in the coming months. The Committee continues to judge that there are two-sided risks around the medium-term inflation outlook, primarily from wage developments on the upside and from energy and global tradable goods prices on the downside. The Committee will update its assessment on the balance of the risks to medium-term inflation in light of the relevant data as they emerge. 1. Before turning to its immediate policy decision, and against the backdrop of its latest economic projections, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. 2. UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.8% in 2021 Q4, as had been expected in the November Monetary Policy Report. In 2022 Q1, global GDP was expected to grow more slowly than had been anticipated in the November Report, as the Omicron Covid variant had led to renewed restrictions and voluntary social distancing in many countries. However, the uncertainty relating to the economic impact of Omicron had declined, and its economic consequences were likely to be more limited and of shorter duration than had been anticipated at the time of the MPC's December meeting. Global cost pressures, arising from the strength in goods demand and supply chain disruptions as well as high energy prices, had remained elevated and had also weighed on activity over past months. Strong demand for goods, in particular in the United States, had appeared to have been a more important determinant of global bottlenecks than supply chain disruptions over recent months. 3. According to the preliminary flash estimate, euro-area GDP had increased by 0.3% in 2021 Q4, such that output had returned to its 2019 Q4 level. This was weaker than had been expected in the November Report, due to tighter restrictions to address rising Covid case numbers in November and December in several countries, driven initially by the Delta variant and subsequently by Omicron. The unemployment rate had fallen to 7.0% in December, a historical low. Omicron case numbers had increased going into 2022 and, as a result, euro-area output was expected to contract slightly in the first quarter. Notwithstanding restrictions starting to ease in some countries, recent indicators had pointed to weakness in Covid-sensitive sectors with the flash services activity PMI falling back in January. The manufacturing output PMI had picked up, possibly suggesting some stabilisation in supply constraints, particularly in Germany. 4. According to the advance estimate, US GDP had grown by 1.7% in 2021 Q4, implying that output had been around 3% above its 2019 Q4 level. This had reflected a stronger recovery than had been anticipated in the November Report, as the economic impact of the Delta variant had waned. Growth in the fourth quarter had been accounted for primarily by stockbuilding. Consumption had also supported growth, and there had been evidence for a continuing rotation of household spending from goods to services. The labour market had appeared tight at the end of 2021. The unemployment rate had fallen to 3.9% in December, the lowest level since February 2020, as participation rates had remained below pre-Covid levels and the number of job vacancies had continued to be high relative to historical levels. More recent high-frequency card spending data suggested that there had been a relatively temporary disruption to spending related to Omicron around the turn of the year, with limited restrictions in place. In 2022 Q1, GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%. 5. In China, GDP had increased by 1.6% in 2021 Q4, stronger than had been expected in the November Report. Year-on-year industrial production growth had increased in December, reflecting an easing of power shortages and of some input constraints, as well as strong external demand. However, consumption indicators had continued to be somewhat weaker than measures of production, with year-on-year retail sales growth slowing, as localised Covid outbreaks and associated restrictions weighed on domestic demand. The recent outbreaks appeared to have had a relatively limited impact on the supply capacity of the economy but, looking ahead, there was uncertainty as to whether the more transmissible Omicron variant might cause greater supply disruptions, to the extent that China maintained its current Covid strategy. The housing market had continued to slow. 6. Consumer price inflation had remained elevated in the euro area and the United States. Euro-area annual HICP inflation had increased to 5.1% in January, significantly above market expectations immediately ahead of the release, while core inflation had fallen to 2.3%. In the United States, annual PCE inflation had risen to 5.8% in December, with core inflation increasing to 4.9%. High energy prices had driven most of the pickup in consumer price inflation over the fourth quarter in the euro area, while price pressures were more broadly based in the United States, with strong contributions from energy, cars, accommodation and other core goods. This suggested that, in addition to high energy prices, pressures from global bottlenecks due to strong demand for goods and inelastic supply had been passing through to consumer prices. There had also been some divergence in wage growth between the United States and the euro area. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantas measure, US wage growth had continued to increase in the fourth quarter, to somewhat above its pre-Covid rate, while wage growth in the euro area had remained muted in the third quarter. 7. The MPC discussed the central case for, as well as risks to, the global inflation outlook. In the near term, there would likely be further pass-through to consumer price inflation from past cost increases. Since the MPCs December meeting, signals from cost indicators had been mixed. Energy prices had been volatile. Wholesale gas spot prices had initially fallen back in Europe from their peak in mid-December, but had recently risen again amid increasing geopolitical tensions. The Brent oil spot price had risen by $19 per barrel since the MPCs previous meeting, to $91. Measures of shipping costs had been mixed, with some easing and others increasing once more. Indices of global input prices and delivery times had plateaued, suggesting some stabilisation in global bottlenecks at high levels. Overall, global bottlenecks were expected to ease over the next twelve months as spending in the United States rotated back to services, a little later than had been anticipated in the November Report. There was, however, a risk that the demand rotation could be delayed further, for example if consumer preferences had shifted more permanently. Supply chains could also be further disrupted in the event of widespread factory and port closures in China in response to Covid developments. Should these risks materialise, consumer prices could rise further than anticipated. Alternatively, it was possible that global cost pressures abated more quickly and to a greater extent in the medium term than expected, in which case consumer price inflation might moderate at a faster pace as well. 8. Since the MPCs previous meeting, advanced-economy government bond yields had risen significantly. Ten-year yields had increased by around 35 to 60 basis points in the United States, euro area and United Kingdom, reaching their highest levels since the onset of the pandemic. These increases had been accounted for primarily by real rates. The increases in nominal yields had reflected higher estimated term premia across countries, with a high degree of comovement between yields across different economies. 9. The path for market-implied policy rates in the United States had risen significantly since the MPCs previous meeting. At its 26 January meeting, the FOMC had left its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and had continued to reduce the monthly pace of its asset purchases, as well as publishing additional information regarding its principles for significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. The market-implied policy rate in the United States reached around 1 ¼% by end-2022, around 50 basis points higher than immediately prior to the MPCs December meeting. In the euro area, the near-term market-implied path for policy rates had moved down a little over the same period. At its meeting on 16 December, the ECB Governing Council had left its key policy interest rates unchanged, and had announced a gradual reduction in the pace of net asset purchases. 10. In the United Kingdom, market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate over the year ahead had risen, with market pricing consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%, at this MPC meeting. The February Monetary Policy Report was conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate, based on the 15-working day average to 26 January, that rose to around 1 ½% by mid-2023. In the immediate run-up to the MPCs February meeting, the market-implied path for Bank Rate had reached around 1.7% by mid-2023. The results of the Bank of Englands new Market Participants Survey, which would be published for the first time on the Friday following the release of these minutes, had painted a broadly similar picture of Bank Rate expectations: respondents had widely expected a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate at this meeting; a large majority expected Bank Rate to reach 1% within the next year; and respondents assessed that the balance of risks around this near-term path was skewed to the upside. Respondents expected reinvestments of the Banks holdings of UK government bonds to cease after the anticipated Bank Rate increase at this meeting. 11. Medium-term inflation compensation measures in the United Kingdom had increased slightly since the MPCs previous meeting and had remained above their average levels of the past decade, in contrast to similar measures in the United States and the euro area, which had been around their average levels of the past decade. As the Committee had discussed previously, interpreting UK medium-term inflation compensation measures was not straightforward. Nevertheless, models that attempted to extract medium-term market expectations for CPI inflation, and intelligence gathered from market contacts, suggested that higher inflation expectations and greater perceived risks to inflation might have in part accounted for these above-average levels of medium-term inflation compensation measures, alongside other factors. This was consistent with results from the Market Participants Survey, which had suggested that respondents attributed these levels in part to elevated inflation expectations, but also to technical factors, such as those arising from the fact that inflation markets were used for hedging large pension liabilities, and an upside balance of risks around the inflation outlook. 12. The sterling effective exchange rate had risen by around 2% since the previous MPC meeting. The US dollar had, in contrast, fallen by around  ½%, despite a relatively large increase in US government bond yields. 13. Equity prices had fallen after the MPCs previous meeting, before recovering. The initial fall had reflected the increase in government bond yields, as well as the impact of geopolitical developments. Overall, equity prices had ended the period lower in the United States, while in the United Kingdom they had increased somewhat, cushioned by an estimated fall in equity risk premia. This in part had reflected the composition of the FTSE All Share index, including its skew towards sectors that had been supported by the recent rise in energy prices. Across countries, there had been stronger performance in those sectors more exposed to Covid, relative to those more exposed to higher interest rates. There had been less adjustment in the corporate bond market, as spreads had remained at historically low levels, having reversed the modest increases seen in response to the initial emergence of Omicron. 14. Lending rates on mortgages with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at or below 75% had increased further since the MPCs previous meeting. This was broadly consistent with a lagged response to the increases in risk-free rates in the fourth quarter of 2021, with around half of those increases having passed through to lending rates. The subsequent further increases in risk-free rates seen since the December MPC meeting would be expected to feed through to mortgage lending rates in due course. Other components of household borrowing, such as credit cards and personal loans had been less sensitive, as would be expected. 15. UK quarterly GDP growth in 2021 Q3 had been revised down slightly in the Quarterly National Accounts, from 1.3% to 1.1%. The level of GDP had, however, been revised up by around  ½%, with that news more than accounted for by a higher path of household consumption throughout the pandemic. In the third quarter, consumption had risen by 2.7%, while the saving ratio had fallen back to 8.3%. Business investment had fallen by 2.5% in Q3, with particular weakness in the air transport sector, and had remained well below its pre-Covid level in 2019 Q4. 16. GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.9% in November, stronger than had been expected by Bank staff. Combined with the upward revisions to GDP, this meant that, prior to the onset of the Omicron variant, aggregate activity had regained its pre-pandemic level for the first time. GDP had been almost 1% higher than expected at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report. Within the November output data, activity had been stronger than expected across most sectors of the economy, including consumer-facing, transport and professional services. There had also been tentative signs in the manufacturing and construction sectors that supply disruptions were starting to ease, although monthly data could be volatile. 17. Bank staff expected GDP to have fallen by around  ½% in December, largely due to the impact of the Omicron variant towards the end of the month, but to have risen by just over 1% during 2021 Q4 as a whole. Retail sales volumes had fallen quite sharply in December, according to official data, in part reflecting the unwind of previous strength, as consumers appeared to have brought forward some purchases ahead of the holiday season, and as Omicron had weighed on activity. Contacts of the Banks Agents had reported that shortages of some goods due to continuing supply-chain issues had not constrained aggregate spending by as much as had been anticipated. Nevertheless, staff shortages, exacerbated by absences due to sickness or self-isolation, were reported to have curtailed activity across a number of sectors. 18. Having reached a very high level around the turn of the year, the number of Covid cases had fallen back, and had then appeared to have stabilised. On 21 December, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had announced that additional support would be available for businesses who were impacted by the Omicron variant, including one-off grants of up to  £6,000 per premise for businesses in the hospitality and leisure sectors in England, and that the Government would cover the cost of Statutory Sick Pay for Covid-related absences for small and medium-sized employers across the United Kingdom. In the run-up to this MPC meeting, the UK Government and Devolved Administrations had announced a number of relaxations to Covid measures, some of which had been put in place in response to the Omicron variant. These had included the lifting of Plan B measures in England during the second half of January, and the removal of post-arrival testing requirements for fully vaccinated travellers into the United Kingdom from 11 February. 19. Recent high-frequency indicators suggested that activity had rebounded somewhat since early January, including in consumer-facing services and work-related travel. This was consistent with intelligence from the Banks Agents that the peak economic impacts of the Omicron variant had passed quickly. GfK consumer confidence had nevertheless fallen in January, probably due to initial concerns around the impact of Omicron. Despite the incipient squeeze on real household disposable incomes, households views of their own financial situation had, so far, held up relatively well. Contacts of the Banks Agents had noted, however, that they expected pressure on household incomes to dampen consumer spending in the coming months. Overall, Bank staff expected GDP to recover further in February and March, such that the economy was projected to return to its pre-pandemic level of activity once again by the end of the first quarter, and that GDP on average would be unchanged between 2022 Q1 and 2021 Q4. Market sector GDP was expected to surpass its November 2021 level by March. 20. Although the number of companies reporting skilled labour shortages as a constraint on output in the January CBI Industrial Trends survey had remained very elevated, the number of companies reporting materials shortages as a factor limiting production had fallen back somewhat from its highest level since the mid-1970s, and the January manufacturing PMIs had suggested that supply constraints were not worsening as much as in previous months. Contacts of the Banks Agents expected only a slow improvement in supply chain disruption through 2022, and some continued to judge that problems could persist into 2023. There had also been increasing reports of slower investment growth due to shortages of goods, machinery and labour. There had, nevertheless, been widespread strength in investment intentions reported to the Agents, with contacts highlighting the reinstatement of projects that had been paused during the pandemic, and the need to increase capacity to meet demand. After weakening in December, the January Decision Maker Panel had reported a smaller drag from Covid on business investment over the first half of this year. 21. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate had fallen to 4.1% in the three months to November, 0.4 percentage points lower than had been expected at the time of the November Monetary Policy Report. The LFS employment rate had been broadly as expected, however, as inactivity had unexpectedly risen slightly. The number of inactive people who reported wanting a job had continued to fall. Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) employee payrolls had risen by a further 184,000 in the single month of December, although these initial estimates had tended to be revised down somewhat. Bank staff judged that both the LFS employee and HMRC payroll series were around their 2019 Q4 levels after accounting for an unusually high number of individuals having switched from self-employment and onto payrolls, associated in part with tax reforms. Self-employment had remained weak even accounting for these estimates of switching, such that LFS employment was 1.4% below its 2019 Q4 level in the three months to November. Indicators of labour market tightness had nevertheless remained elevated. The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had increased to another record high since a consistent series had begun in 2001. 22. Bank staff expected the LFS unemployment rate to fall further to 3.8% in 2022 Q1, despite the spread of Omicron weighing on activity at the beginning of the quarter. The flash composite employment PMI for January had been broadly unchanged on the month, remaining well above its past historical average. The Banks Agents had reported a modest easing in employment growth, in part due to recruitment difficulties having remained intense. High-frequency indicators of online vacancies had dipped during December and had begun to recover in January, but that profile had been comparable to the seasonal pattern prior to the pandemic. Instead of weaker labour demand, the main counterpart in the labour market to Covid-related weakness in activity had appeared to be an increase in staff absences due to sickness, self-isolation or caring responsibilities. The ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey suggested that around 3% of the workforce had been absent for Covid-related reasons around the turn of the year. The Agents contacts had begun to see a reduction in absences, however, and generally viewed Omicron as a temporary issue. 23. Growth in private-sector regular Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) had slowed to 4.1% in the three months to November on a year earlier, broadly in line with Bank staff expectations ahead of the release. Pay growth had been boosted by the mechanical effects of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and changes in the composition of the workforce, but those effects had waned in recent months. Adjusting for these effects, Bank staff estimated that underlying private-sector regular pay growth had remained at around 4 to 4 ½%, above pre-pandemic rates of around 3 to 3 ½%. The median of pay growth based on HMRC payrolls data was around 3%, comparable to pre-pandemic rates, implying that recent pay awards had been more skewed towards the upside than in the recent past. That was broadly consistent with the Banks Agents contacts reporting that pay increases had been significantly higher for workers with skills in short supply. 24. In the February Report projection, underlying private-sector pay growth was expected to pick up further in coming quarters. A special survey of firms conducted by the Banks Agents suggested that the average pay settlement was expected to rise to close to 5% in 2022, with the pickup broadly based across different sectors of the economy and firms of different sizes. Contacts had cited the ability to retain staff and recruit new workers, and increases in consumer price inflation, as factors that had pushed up their expectations for pay. The REC permanent staff salaries index, which measured the monthly pay growth of new permanent hires, had also remained close to record highs in December. Headline AWE growth was expected to be somewhat lower than the underlying rate, as the past boost to pay from compositional effects was assumed to continue to fade, although there was uncertainty around the precise scale and speed of any such unwind. 25. Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen to 5.4% in December, almost 1 percentage point above the November Report forecast. The upside news had been spread across a number of components, particularly within core goods. Strength in core goods prices, alongside higher energy prices, had also accounted for much of the absolute overshoot in inflation relative to the 2% target. Services price inflation had moved further above its pre-Covid rate. Price increases had been particularly acute for second-hand cars and hospitality, replicating trends in the United States. 26. CPI inflation was projected to increase further in coming months, to close to 6% in February and March and peaking at around 7 ¼% in April when higher utility price caps were due to be implemented. This projected peak was around 2 percentage points higher than had been expected in the November Report. In addition to the upside news in the CPI data to December, wholesale gas and electricity futures prices had increased further, putting upward pressure on utility prices. The costs of the Supplier of Last Resort mechanism, covering the losses that energy companies had incurred from taking on customers from failed suppliers, were also expected to begin to be passed on to household energy bills. The annual ONS update of the CPI weights was anticipated by Bank staff to lead to an increase in CPI inflation in the near term, in part due to greater weight being placed on energy prices. Certain contract prices, such as for telecommunication services, that were indexed to consumer price measures were also due to increase in coming months. 27. Survey indicators of costs and prices, such as the flash composite input and output price PMIs for January, had remained at historically elevated levels. The Banks Agents had reported that the costs of some raw materials and shipping rates on some routes appeared to be stabilising, but that higher energy and wage costs were putting additional upward pressure on prices. The Agents pay survey had suggested that around 70% of companies were expecting to increase their prices due to current wage pressures, although that share was lower among consumer-facing firms. 28. Measures of households and companies short-term inflation expectations had risen further since the MPCs previous meeting. The Citi/YouGov household measure of expectations for the year ahead had increased from 4.0% in December to 4.8% in January, although the five-to-ten year ahead measure was unchanged. Respondents to the Decision Maker Panel had increased their expectations for their own price increases over the next twelve months from 4.2% in the survey covering the three months to November to 4.5% for the three months to January. Professional forecasters continued to expect CPI inflation to be close to the 2% target two and three years ahead. 29. The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. 30. The Committee reviewed recent developments against the backdrop of its updated central projections for activity and inflation as set out in the accompanying February Monetary Policy Report. The projections were conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rose to around 1 ½% by the middle of 2023. Wholesale energy prices were assumed to follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain constant beyond that, in contrast to futures curves, which were downward sloping over coming years. There were material risks around this assumption. 31. UK-weighted world GDP in 2021 Q4 was estimated to have grown in line with expectations in the November Report. In 2022 Q1, global GDP was expected to grow more slowly, but the uncertainty relating to the economic impact of Omicron had declined, and its economic consequences were likely to be more limited and of shorter duration than had been anticipated at the time of the MPC's December meeting. In the February Report projections, global activity continued to grow thereafter, but was restrained by higher global energy prices over the forecast period, and by the impact of ongoing supply chain constraints for tradable goods over the coming year. 32. Consumer price inflation had risen further in the United States and the euro area since the Committees previous meeting. Global cost pressures, arising from the strength in goods demand and supply chain disruptions as well as high energy prices, had also remained elevated. Wholesale gas spot prices had initially fallen back in Europe from their peak in mid-December, but had recently risen again amid increasing geopolitical tensions. Oil prices had risen significantly. Strong demand for goods, in particular in the United States, had appeared to have been a more important determinant of global bottlenecks than supply chain disruptions over recent months. In the February Report projections, world export prices were expected to rise a little further in the near term. As global bottlenecks eased, global tradable goods prices were expected to fall a little over the forecast period, though to remain well above their pre-pandemic levels. 33. Since the MPCs previous meeting, advanced-economy government bond yields had increased significantly. Market-implied expectations for the path of Bank Rate had risen, with market pricing consistent with an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points, to 0.5%, at this MPC meeting. The results of the Bank of Englands Market Participants Survey, which would be published for the first time on the Friday following the release of these minutes, had painted a broadly similar picture of Bank Rate expectations. 34. Having reached a very high level around the turn of the year, the number of Covid cases had fallen back in the United Kingdom, and had then appeared to have stabilised. In the run-up to this MPC meeting, the UK Government and Devolved Administrations had announced a number of relaxations to Covid measures, some of which had been put in place in response to the Omicron variant. The MPCs projections were conditioned on the assumptions that no material restrictions on economic activity were re-imposed, and that there was no further widespread voluntary social distancing, following this wave. 35. UK GDP was estimated to have risen by 0.9% in November. Combined with upward revisions to GDP, this meant that, prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, aggregate activity had regained its pre-pandemic level for the first time. The Omicron variant was expected to have depressed activity somewhat in December and January. But its economic impact was likely to be limited and of short duration, and GDP was expected to recover in February and March such that output returned to its pre-pandemic level once again by the end of the first quarter. 36. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate had fallen to 4.1% in the three months to November, 0.4 percentage points lower than had been expected at the time of the November Report. It was expected to fall further in the near term, to 3.8% in 2022 Q1, despite the spread of Omicron weighing on activity at the beginning of the quarter. The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had increased, to another record high. Most indicators of the balance of demand and supply in the economy suggested that there was currently a small margin of excess demand across the economy as a whole. 37. Beyond the near term, UK GDP growth was expected to slow to subdued rates. The main reason for that was the adverse impact of higher global energy and tradable goods prices on UK real aggregate income and spending. 38. Consumption growth was expected to slow, as households cut back on spending in the face of the material adverse effects on their real incomes from the sharp rises in global energy and tradable goods prices, and the planned increase in national insurance contributions in April 2022. Although consumption growth therefore slowed materially over the first two years of the forecast period, it remained above income growth. That reflected an assumption that households would spend some of the significant additional savings that they had accumulated, in aggregate, during the pandemic. As a result, the household saving rate was expected to fall from 8.3% in 2021 Q3 to below 4% from the end of 2022. There were risks in both directions around this projection. Given the windfall nature of the excess savings built up during the course of the pandemic, households could be more willing to spend out of these to support their level of real consumption. Set against that, existing savings were more concentrated among higher earners, who might generally spend proportionately little out of their savings. Developments in energy prices in particular could also disproportionately affect those households with lower savings. 39. In the February Report projections, a margin of excess supply was expected to emerge later this year and to build over the forecast period. In part, that was accounted for by some slack in the labour market, with the unemployment rate expected to rise to around 5% by the end of the projection. 40. Underlying earnings growth was estimated to have remained above pre-pandemic rates, and was expected to strengthen over the coming year, to around 4 ¾%. This was consistent with the results of the Banks Agents annual pay survey, with the tight labour market, and with some temporary upward pressure on wage settlements from higher price inflation. 41. Twelve-month CPI inflation had risen from 5.1% in November to 5.4% in December, almost 1 percentage point higher than had been expected at the time of the November Report. The upside news had been spread across a number of components, particularly within core goods. Strength in core goods prices, alongside higher energy prices, had accounted for much of the absolute overshoot in inflation relative to the 2% target. Services price inflation had moved further above its pre-Covid rate. 42. CPI inflation was expected to increase further in coming months, to close to 6% in February and March, before peaking at around 7 ¼% in April. This projected peak was around 2 percentage points higher than expected in the November Report. Three-quarters of the projected increase in inflation between December and April was expected to reflect higher contributions from energy and goods prices. Survey indicators of costs and prices had remained at historically elevated levels. 43. The HM Treasury representative had briefed the Committee on the Governments policy plans in response to Ofgems forthcoming price cap announcement. 44. In the February Report central projection, upward pressures on CPI inflation were expected to dissipate over time, as global energy prices were assumed to remain constant after six months, and as global bottlenecks eased and tradable goods prices fell back a little. Underlying wage growth was also projected to ease from 2023, as the labour market loosened gradually and inflation declined. Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPCs current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation was projected to fall back to a little above the 2% target in two years time and to below the target by a greater margin in three years. In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 0.5%, CPI inflation was expected to be 2.6% and 2.1% in two and three years time respectively. 45. In an alternative scenario that was conditioned on the market-implied path for Bank Rate and energy prices following forward curves throughout the forecast period, and as was set out in the February Report, excess supply was around  ½ percentage point lower in the medium term than in the MPCs central projection, and CPI inflation was around  ¾ percentage point below the 2% target in two and three years time. 46. Measures of households and companies short-term inflation expectations had risen further since the MPCs previous meeting. Measures of inflation expectations two to three years ahead, as well as some longer-term measures derived from household surveys and financial markets, had also increased in recent months, but by less than short-term measures. Professional forecasters continued to expect CPI inflation to be close to the 2% target two and three years ahead. A risk to the inflation outlook was that longer-term inflation expectations evolved such that wage and price setting were not consistent with inflation returning to the 2% target in the medium term. Overall, the MPC judged that inflation expectations remained well anchored at present. The Committee would, nevertheless, continue to monitor measures of inflation expectations very closely. 47. In Box A of the August 2021 Monetary Policy Report, the Committee had set out its strategy for the mix of monetary policy instruments to deliver tighter policy, including its preference in most circumstances to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The Committee had noted that it intended to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bonds, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets, when Bank Rate reached 0.5% and if appropriate given the economic circumstances. This would have the benefit of providing a predictable and gradual path for the reduction in the stock of government bonds. The MPC would also consider actively selling some of the stock of government bonds only once Bank Rate had risen to at least 1%, and depending on economic circumstances at the time. The Box had stated that the MPC would take a separate decision on the corporate bond portfolio in due course. 48. In the run-up to this MPC meeting, the Committee had considered its strategy for reducing the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. It judged that ceasing reinvestments and, in addition, initiating a programme of corporate bond sales at the point Bank Rate reached 0.5%, would appropriately reflect the specific characteristics of the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS). It also judged that this would not have implications for the unwinding of the UK government bond portfolio, which would continue to be governed by the framework set out in Box A in the August Report. 49. The CBPS, at  £20 billion, was far smaller than the stock of UK government bonds held by the APF, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of their respective markets. The MPC therefore judged that the impact on monetary conditions of unwinding the stock of corporate bonds, at a time when markets were functioning normally, was likely to be relatively small. 50. The Committee turned to its immediate policy decision. 51. The MPCs remit was clear that the inflation target applied at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognised that there would be occasions when inflation would depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy had been subject to very large and repeated shocks. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent, the sharp rises in prices of global energy and tradable goods of which the United Kingdom was a net importer, would necessarily weigh on UK real aggregate income and spending. This was something monetary policy was unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy was to ensure that, as such a real economic adjustment occurred, it did so consistent with achieving the 2% CPI inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. 52. Given the current tightness of the labour market and continuing signs of greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures, all members of the Committee judged that an increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. Different members placed different weights on the arguments for an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 or of 0.5 percentage points at this meeting. 53. Five members judged that a 0.25 percentage point increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. The February Report projections implied that some tightening in monetary policy was required to bring inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. However, the forecast also incorporated a material trade-off related to the continuing global energy and tradable goods price shock, with CPI inflation expected to remain materially above the target in the first half of the forecast, at the same time as a margin of spare capacity was opening up. After the second year, conditioned on the market path for Bank Rate, CPI inflation was projected to fall below the target due to that widening margin of spare capacity. In the scenario in which energy prices followed their forward curves throughout the forecast period, inflation was projected to undershoot the target by  ¾ percentage point in two and three years time. These members recognised the risks from the possibility of stronger domestic wage and price pressures in the near term, but also saw a need to balance this against the potential for inflation to fall more quickly and to a greater extent than expected if energy and other tradable goods prices followed a lower path than in the MPCs central projection. There was also a case for moving Bank Rate in small increments; a larger increase at this meeting could have an outsized impact on expectations for the further path of policy, which was already sufficient, in the central projection, to push inflation well below the target in year three of the forecast. 54. Four members judged that a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate was warranted at this meeting. Monetary policy had been very accommodative, and capacity pressures were now widespread, especially in the labour market. The projected path for CPI inflation was again being revised up over the first two years of the forecast period, while medium-term inflation expectations remained relatively high and on some measures had increased further. Companies responding to the Decision Maker Panel had indicated that they expected to raise prices significantly in 2022. The strong pickup in pay settlements reported to the Banks Agents, and the recent broadening from goods price to services price inflation, suggested that these developments were now being reflected in domestic costs and prices, which could make CPI inflation more persistent than was expected in the February Report central projection. Monetary policy should tighten to a greater extent at this meeting in order to reduce the risk that recent trends in pay growth and inflation expectations became more firmly embedded and thereby help to bring inflation back to the target sustainably in the medium term. 55. Consistent with the MPCs guidance set out in the August 2021 Report, and given that financial markets were functioning normally, the Committee agreed at this meeting that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any future maturities falling due from its stock of UK government bond purchases. This reflected the MPCs intention to reduce its holdings of government bonds in a gradual and predictable manner. 56. In addition, the Committee agreed that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any maturities falling due from its stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, and that it should initiate a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. 57. The decision to initiate this programme of corporate bond sales reflected the specific characteristics of the corporate bond market and the MPCs involvement in it, and should not be taken as a signal regarding the commencement, scale or duration of any potential future UK government bond sales programme. The Committee reaffirmed that it would consider beginning the process of actively selling UK government bonds only once Bank Rate had risen to at least 1%, and depending on economic circumstances at the time. 58. The Committee also reaffirmed its preference in most circumstances to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The Committee agreed that, as a matter of course, it would not continue to vote at each meeting on propositions regarding the stock of purchased assets, at least until any decision concerning sales of UK government bonds. If potential movements in Bank Rate were judged insufficient to achieve the inflation target, or if prevailing conditions were ones in which asset purchases might be particularly effective, the reductions in the stock of purchased assets could be amended or reversed. 59. The extent of any further tightening in monetary policy would depend on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The MPC judged that, if the economy developed broadly in line with the February Report central projections, some further modest tightening in monetary policy was likely to be appropriate in the coming months. The Committee continued to judge that there were two-sided risks around the medium-term inflation outlook, primarily from wage developments on the upside and from energy and global tradable goods prices on the downside. The Committee would update its assessment on the balance of the risks to medium-term inflation in light of the relevant data as they emerged. 60. The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the propositions that: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Huw Pill and Silvana Tenreyro) voted in favour of the first proposition. Four members (Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders) voted against this proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 0.75%. The Committee voted unanimously in favour of the second and third propositions. 61. At its September 2021 meeting, the MPC had agreed to reinvest the cash flows associated with reductions in the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases held by the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) back into eligible corporate bonds, commencing in November 2021. The Committee had been briefed at its February meeting on this programme of reinvestments completed in the run-up to the meeting and undertaken in line with the approach to greening set out in the Bank of England's announcement in November 2021. 62. As of 2 February 2022, the total stock of assets held in the APF was  £895 billion, comprising  £875 billion of UK government bond purchases and  £20 billion of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases. 63. Consistent with the Committees decision at this meeting to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, the  £27.9 billion of cash flows associated with the redemption of the March 2022 gilt held by the APF would not be reinvested. 64. In total over 2022 and 2023, just over  £70 billion of UK government bonds held by the APF would mature, and over 2024 and 2025 around a further  £130 billion of bonds would mature. Details of the full maturity profile of APF-owned government bonds would be set out on the Bank of Englands website, which would be kept updated to ensure that the general public and financial markets had clear information on how the size of the APF was scheduled to evolve. 65. As the stock of purchased assets began to fall, the Bank of England would continue to monitor money market functioning closely, and would stand ready to adjust reserves in either direction if judged necessary to facilitate the smooth transmission of monetary policy. 66. Consistent with the decision at this meeting to begin to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, the Committee asked Bank staff to design a programme of corporate bond sales, details of which would be announced within three months. The programme would be designed so as not to disrupt the functioning of the sterling investment-grade corporate bond market. Further details, including the initial schedule of operations, would be set out in a Market Notice to be published ahead of the start of sales. 67. The Governor had written a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer setting out some of these considerations. In addition, the letter highlighted that it was appropriate for the Government indemnity associated with the APF to reduce in size progressively, in line with the reduction in the stock of purchased assets. 68. The following members of the Committee were present: Clare Lombardelli was present as the Treasury representative. 69. As permitted under the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, Ron Kalifa was also present on 26 and 28 January, as an observer for the purpose of exercising oversight functions in his role as a member of the Banks Court of Directors. \n","20180802\n","The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at  £435 billion. Since the May Inflation Report, the near-term outlook has evolved broadly in line with the MPCs expectations. Recent data appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter. The labour market has continued to tighten and unit labour cost growth has firmed. The MPCs updated projections for inflation and activity are set out in the August Inflation Report and are broadly similar to its projections in May. In the MPCs central forecast, conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, GDP is expected to grow by around 1 ¾% per year on average over the forecast period. Global demand grows above its estimated potential rate and financial conditions remain accommodative, although both are somewhat less supportive of UK activity over the forecast period. Net trade and business investment continue to support UK activity, while consumption grows in line with the subdued pace of real incomes. Although modest by historical standards, the projected pace of GDP growth over the forecast is slightly faster than the diminished rate of supply growth, which averages around 1 ½% per year. The MPC continues to judge that the UK economy currently has a very limited degree of slack. Unemployment is low and is projected to fall a little further. In the MPCs central projection, therefore, a small margin of excess demand emerges by late 2019 and builds thereafter, feeding through into higher growth in domestic costs than has been seen over recent years. CPI inflation was 2.4% in June, pushed above the 2% target by external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterlings past depreciation and higher energy prices. The contribution of external pressures is projected to ease over the forecast period while the contribution of domestic cost pressures is expected to rise.   Taking these influences together, and conditioned on the gently rising path of Bank Rate implied by current market yields, CPI inflation remains slightly above 2% through most of the forecast period, reaching the target in the third year. The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The Committee judges that an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points is warranted at this meeting. The Committee also judges that, were the economy to continue to develop broadly in line with its Inflation Report projections, an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2% target at a conventional horizon. Any future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.
